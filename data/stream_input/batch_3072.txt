B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I don't know how else to describe this book.  This was my first read by this author.  Brilliant!  Going to look up some of her other works.
B000LXHK2C|4.0|I love almost everything about this film, except for a major mismatch between the casting and the script.<br /><br />Russell Crowe and Marion Cotillard are both excellent actors, but the storyline calls for them to be the same age, which just didn't work for me at all, no matter how hard I squinted.<br /><br />Honestly, Ridley? Was it that hard to find a suitable female lead who wasn't 11 years younger than Russell? Would it have killed you?
B009439HEY|5.0|A brilliant compilation by Hackett!!! Hackett and his guest musicians were phenomenal. This recording was even better than Revisited 1, the sound quality of the recording was much clearer than&#34;1&#34;. If you are a Genesis fan you will not be disappointed in this recording. For those of you not acquainted with the original Genesis you are in for a treat. I do like 'some' of the more recent Genesis music, BUT this music from the early band is undoubtedly the best!!!<br />My recommendation, BUY the Revisted 1 and 2 discs, you&#34;ll not be disappointed.!!! Better yet see Hackett in person if you are able to!!
B00DZV15FU|5.0|I like to read books from the eighteenth and nineteenth century when the morals are kept to that time period and not setting morals from today. It makes for a better read and more story line.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Great documentary! I really enjoyed seeing the beginnings of some of my favorite artists. I am so jealous of Dave Grohl!
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I love the way that Emma keeps getting herself in trouble and helps everyone else overlooking her own love life.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This product had some nice features and they all work well.  It's easy to use.  And the display is large enough for me to read at night without my glasses.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|mind bender!!!<br />i am addicted. all i want to do is go home and watch homeland and stress eat while i watch it!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I got this for my Kindle HD.I found out I couldn't work it very well. It gave me the map ok but I just couldn't work with it.Someone smarter than me would get it.Not bad for free
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game but I can not find all the notes. All of my tasks are filled with ones where I have to complete a collection. I have everything except the eighth note (I think that is it) and none of my rooms have it available to find :(  how do I get it!?!?!?!
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My little grandson really enjoys the Jumperoo.  It's got all kinds of interesting noise makers that he plays with and the bouncing and jumping he does in the seat keeps the action going.  Add to that, the fact that the seat turns in a complete circle makes this activity center a very good buy.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|As a star-trek fanatic, I was expecting a little more from this movie.  I waited for the Blu-ray to release to watch it; and perhaps the reviews set my expectations too high.  Despite my initial impression, the acting and effects are top-notch and the story is well-written.  My biggest gripe is a huge spoiler at the end, so I'll spare you... but Spock doesn't cry!
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Totally enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh and it made me cry. Just a feel good movie. The length is it's only downfall. Not that I didn't want the movie to last forever, but because not everyone has that  much time to watch. It's a super movie and very clever how they put Forrest into clips of real events.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is really cool.  However, you may want to upgrade your router; as I've found that Chromecast slows everything else down on my network.  I have trouble streaming HD video, but I believe that's a function of my substandard router.  My family watches TV during dinner, and this item allows us to spread out in the living room, and not huddle over the laptop.
B00571F26Y|5.0|When I read this book, my thought was, &#34;This is me!&#34;  Dr. Davis explains the effects of genetically modified wheat on the body in a way that is understandable.  I have been wheat-free for about 10 days now and have lost at least 8 pounds and am sleeping better.  I am having less arthritic pain in my knees as well.  I am telling lots of my friends about &#34;Wheat Belly&#34; and will continue to recommend it.  The cookbook is great, too.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun. Don't like the wait when starting over.  My kids love to play.  Cute. Fun. Did I say fun! Fun!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett is always a great story teller and this series is one of his best. I am waiting for the final edition.
0689853491|5.0|This is a great book to read with toddlers or older children. It has a good amount of repetition for younger children so that they can help you read it. It also has a lot of sound and movement details that lend themselves to adding motions to the story.<br /><br />I've read it with a two year old and a class of third graders, and it was a favorite all around. I highly recommend this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|What a game. It is fun, hectic, and frustrating.  But it so fun to try to beat &quot;whatever&quot;, to win. Love it!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this in anticipation that I could stream from my Chrome browser on my laptop. I'm not real techie so maybe my processor just isn't up to speed? (AMD Phenom II N-660 Dual Core Processor) All I know is that streaming from my laptop is NOT what's going on... so that's sad. The video has no audio and is very choppy. From what I could read, it's because my system sucks. (Remember, non-techie only spoken here.)<br /><br />I will say that I do love the streaming capabilities of the Netflix, Hulu Plus, and YouTube apps from my Nexus 7 and my android powered smartphone. It makes watching shows and videos a snap! I have a Panasonic blu-ray player that hates Hulu and takes several minutes just to load the initial start up screen for Netflix. Streaming from either of these apps to my Chromecast is super easy. Open the app, change the casting device to my chromecast at the top of each app, and pick a movie. Viola! It starts up right away! This does not happen on my blu-ray device.<br /><br />Youtube is also easy and fast on the Chromecast. The app lets you browse through videos and then set up shows in a TV queue to play only on the Chromecast. I wish it would save the TV queue but that's okay. Not a deal breaker for me as it is 100x faster than loading my Youtube through the blu-ray player.<br /><br />Set up for the Chromecast was very easy. I think you need to be sure to read the directions carefully and only do one step at a time. I had no problems at all. I do sometimes have issues where it does not recognize my device I am streaming from and I have to close the app and restart it. That is possibly more of an application issue rather than the Chromecast itself.<br /><br />Overall, for $35, I am happy with it, especially now that Hulu Plus works on it. I will love it even more if it could eventually integrate either Amazon Instant or VUDU. I haven't done a Google Play set up yet. I already have wishlists on VUDU and Amazon and am not keen to start a third list just yet for this. I would be over the moon happy if I can ever get my Chrome browser to stream shows from my browser onto my TV smoothly as that was the main reason I really wanted it.et for this.

B000XUBFE2|1.0|Just too dark...I got who the narrator wS right away...it couldn't have been anyone else. That was the only interesting aspect of the book I liked. Very clever.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I am an older parent and tend to have a low tolerance level for alot of the kid movies put out these days, but I did genuinely enjoy this movie. Cute characters and kept my 2 year old glued to the TV, which is very hard to do.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|It is a fun game to play when bored. It is also really fun because you have to really think.
B00009RDGA|5.0|A movie about a con man (Moses Pray) and his daughter Addie Pray as they tour the country ripping people of with their various schemes. Addie's mother has died and Moses offers to take her to St. Louis where her aunt live. He's given $250 to pay her way there but Moses wants to keep the money and just put Addie on a bus. It's intertaining and funny because this little girl is onto him and refuses to let him get away with anything concering her. And excellent performance by the O'Neals (Ryan and Tatum).
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|&#34;Sycamore Row&#34; John Grisham ....great as always. I liked that he traveled back to Ford County & the same town for this one...&#34;Justice&#34; isn't that what we want.

Three-<br />and-a-half star set out of four stars. Some of these: In Colour, Busted,<br />especically are barely worth having, but the four w/ Jon Brant on bass<br />are as classic as the Budokan albums. Problem with the Budokan lps<br />is they rely too much on the first three albums which are good I guess.
B0068THAGY|5.0|I really enjoyed this delightful film. It's sort of a coming of age, summer adventure, &#34;Stand By Me&#34; mashed up with &#34;ET&#34;. The actors are excellent and well cast. The script has that perfect sort of believable dialogue that you remember from your childhood and the production values are first rate. I didn't realize until the ending credits that J.J. Abrams directed this; I'd thought it was Speilberg (he was a Producer). Abrams certainly has the deft touch and eye to pull you into the story and keep you totally engaged though the ending. Very well done!
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Loved that this contained all forms of media.  The movie itself is a lot of fun, saw it twice in the theater and it translates well to our TV and the iPad.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|this movie will go down as his best or at least tied for best actor performance of all time.<br />Classic, one of my all time favorites.

B003730LRY|5.0|With sublime casting and just the right amount of kitsch, this film delivers exactly what you want. Great chemistry between the ensemble and just plain macabre fun.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I don't know why this is so poorly rated! It is a good app and works just fine! Used it for all sorts of music!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is the second app that I've ever downloaded. The first one was one I wanted to get rid of. It worked perfect. Does more than a 50 dollar program on my PC!
0061733199|3.0|Was looking for a good survival book for my EPP (emergency preparedness pack).  While this is pretty informative, it is WAY to broad.  I was looking for something a bit more instructional.  Not for general preparedness for wherever you may be in the world.
B0029LCJJS|1.0|Wasted five minutes of intro to costumed hollywood erotica.  Never did like actor planning Henry, like him less now than before.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Works great for my pc games and watching movies from the computer.  Surround feature works as advertised, works great with vent and mumble.  Easy installation took maybe 10 minutes that's including downloading the software.  So far I get approximately 8 hours of use out of this split between 4 hours of gaming per day.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|All the actors draw you in.  You become part of their lives. The show gets better with each succeeding year.
B009EEQL6A|4.0|Good entertaining action adventure Heartbreak Ridge with TRAINS!!!!<br />Pine and Washington had good chemistry and a wry humor behind their roles.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|This is the story of three homeless people who find a baby and go to great lengths to find the babies family. The chaaracter development is great and the animation  exceptional. They'll find yourself totally wrapped up in this adventure and you'll enjoy seeing it unfold. The beginning of the story moves a little slow but this part is all about establishing the three main character. Once the building portion is complete the story takes off and its one of the best anime adventures you'll ever see.
B00BATKPBE|4.0|Reading Mr Dawkins since the late 70's I have come to consider him a sort of a mentor and a friend. Reading his first volume of his memoir increases those feelings and in my eyes enhances the image of the man behind the scientist

1250038820|5.0|It's been terrific seeing the evolution of HONY over the past two years. This book beautifully captures so many vulnerable, true moments of New Yorkers and, by extension, humans everywhere. All my friends are getting copies this Holiday season! Well done.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|This is yet another classic Bill Bryson book where he finds a topic and does such in depth research and weaves so many interesting things together that are related to his chosen topic.  How is Babe Ruth, Charles Lindburg, prohabition and the depression all related to eachother?  You'll just have to read the book.
B00A32CJQ8|5.0|Wonderful film, beautifully photographed, superb acting. This print looks terrific in glorious black & white. The content is also tremendously important as well. People need to see what can (and DID) happen when the wrong forces go unchecked in a society such as ours. See This Film.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Not your average zombie movie, it was smart and Brad Pitt was awesome.  Not sure why the critics didn't like it.
0062225790|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.. A must have for anyone with any interest in things scientific.  Appropriate for all ages.
B0070YDOT8|3.0|I especially like the tables that you can make and play on your own, or<br />when you feel like it, play with real people...great time killer
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Been using this app a lot and it works great and is sure simple. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This is a well researched book presented in an interesting way. It is an easy read and fun! As a teacher it has been useful in helping me think of how to design lesson plans that will help build character. It also helps me understand how to talk to parents on why it is okay if their child doesn't get an A.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Game is fun to play and gets harder the higher your level. Hours of fun. Would recommend this game to others.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|We usually rent from Red Box, but we were super lazy this night. We also weren't interested in any movies near us. This movie had it all. I would recommend this to anyone who likes stupid love movies or people who want to watch something that will make them laugh, think, and smile.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for adding Candy Crush to Kindle!!! One of my favorite games! Way to keep up with the &quot;others&quot;
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the story - read it in 2 days. It's unique and thoughtful, and I will totally enjoy the movie (read it, you'll see what I mean!)
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Munro is finest writer living today. On a level of Chekov, Maupassant or Carver in her abilities with the short story. Her final collection is as powerful, more so rather, than her first.  I tried desperately to pace myself but the stories are too good, the book impossible to put down. Each collection of her work has left me deeply satisfied, personally changed and moved--and always wanting just one more.<br />Most readers haven't noted her extraordinary humor. Her stories are often Comedies. Like Shakespeare she is equal parts greatness in Comedy and Tragedy.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I think you give more lives and hints that will allow you to get to the next level.  Therefore we won't be stuck for so many days.

0307951154|4.0|Harry Hole returns to Oslo to try to clear the name of a boy he helped raise. He thinks of Oleg as a son and now Oleg is being held by the police for the murder of a drug dealer.<br /><br />In order to find the real killer, Harry becomes involved in the Oslo drug trade.<br /><br />The reader is also given another point of view as we learn of the murdered boy, Gusto's life and how he came to the situation that led to his murder. An alternative point of view is a difficult feat for an author and Jo Nesbo does it well.<br /><br />During the story, Harry comes to deal with a number of characters. They are all so hidden in their protective covers that it is difficult to see who is the good person and who is the evil. This certainly keeps the reader's interest and seems to give Harry an extra incentive to find the murderer.<br /><br />There is a new drug in Oslo and it looks like it is taking over large parts of the city. The police have their own agenda and the crime is being led by someone we wouldn't expect along with a number of ex-Russian henchmen.<br /><br />The suspense was excellent and the characters true to their roles. It is such a dramatic writing that it feels like the reader is right in the pit with the criminals.<br /><br />The conclusion is powerful, and left me with uncertainty about the fate of Harry Hole.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Big fan of Downtown Abbey, but this was probably the best season to date.  Anxiously awaiting the arrival of Season 4.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My son loved this.  I had no idea just how small the pieces were. THANK You for making his day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I'm addicted and cant stop its just so much fun!! I like that I can play with my facebook friends too
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been slow to get on the Candy Crush bandwagon because up to now I had not been able to download on my Kindle. I hate playing these types of games on my phone. This is awesome. I've had to purchase a few &#34;lives&#34; but no big deal. BEWARE: Addictive
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Gresham does it his way again in the Ford County way. More earthy than the slick ones yet equally enthralling. Grateful for this one, but greedy for more of this icon's work asap!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh my God such a sad good funny happy but sad book. I loved it! I don't like the ending though.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I just LOVE the Bloons TD series! They are my favorite Tower Defense games! I have played all the way from BTD to BTD5, and they get better with every generation!<br /><br />This game adds so many new towers, maps, upgrades, and ways to play...its just mind-blowing. This is definitely the BEST Bloons Tower Defense game yet. I have spent...probably more time than I should've...playing this game. There are times I just can't put it down!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this game to EVERYONE who loves Tower Defense games!
B0083GOVLW|5.0|One of the very few movies about Iran that reflects the truth without any exaggeration for the time period it addresses. It shows you what it was like to live in Iran in that era without trying to change the facts to what people like to hear in US and Europe. I am Iranian and loved this movie. There are a lot of books and movies about Iran focusing on what is not really the most important, but what is perceived and expected to be the most important by the western societies, like hijab being mandatory for women (which is important, but not much compared to other issues). If hijab was the only issue there, I would move back to Iran tomorrow. Great work Marjan Satrapi. We need more like you.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is incredibly fun. I can't really understand why though, I mean...the whole point of the game is to engineer a pathogen to infect and eradicate the human race, with a plethora of painful side-effects.<br /><br />Well...morality aside, this is an amazing and fun game that I LOVE to play.<br /><br />I would recommend this game to anyone who likes games and isn't afraid of a little bit of....questionable morality.
B005HSL626|4.0|Simple to learn and a lot of fast-moving fun, this is a delight for children and a challenge for adults.
B004EPYZPI|3.0|Sorry I got this, predictable as heck.  Ryan Phillipe is annoying also.  Wish someone else had played his part.  I would give 2.5 stars if allowed.  Three is too generous.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My daughter talked me into starting to play this game now that I have started can't stop. Can't stop playing although frustrating at times.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|But but sad.  Looking forward to season 4.  But the exercise of adding words just to add words is a silly exercise.
1451666179|5.0|Stop reading the reviews. The book is better than them anyway. Just buy it, get the fastest shipping you're comfortable paying for, and then sit back. If you're already on this page, just click the order button. You deserve it. It's that good.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|The cast was carefully chosen. Spock could not have been better casted!  Bones was brilliant with his voice capturing the original Bones so perfectly.

B008FPOIT6|4.0|A one sentence summary: \\"Seeking Eternal Life, on Google.\\" HA! What a super fun book, very different, which is exciting for this bibliophile....something fresh, a new way to bend my thoughts. I sprinted through, laughing, wondering...curious. A co-mingling of primeval and modernity on a classic human desire, to live forever. Our story is seated in an unusual, mysterious and somewhat covert bookstore, long, thin and tall, tucked inconspicuously next to a strip joint, one might miss it if one weren't looking. Warm, inviting golden light spills out around the clock, with open arms for seekers - the logo, an open book with open hands. In the back bowels are tucked coded tomes, which rather eccentric members pour through trying to unlock the secrets. It is, as expected, owned and run by a lovely Mr. Penumbra, a kind and wizened elder, patient, all knowing. He hires a young computer programmer to take the night shift...unaware that with this decision, his world would change forever - one of the few things he did not foresee. Our young energetic hero takes centuries of information and tradition and elevates the seekers task by introducing the brains of computers. Add speed, 3d imaging, uncoding, sorting, finding, world wide user groups...and what the membership has been trying to see for 500 years starts to reveal itself in a matter of hours/days/weeks. Hearts pound with anticipation. The characters are an unlikely and somewhat motley crew of misfits, idiot-savants, programmers, minions, gardeners, billionaires and twitchy old men in black robes, many smothered in orthodoxy. This is a very computer driven story, so a ticklish joy for us 'users.' However, very readable and well written for the non-savvy computer folks. Don't be afraid, it is well worth it. Gerritszoon, encryptions, underground reading rooms, Googlerz, faith, hope, desire, epistles, bloggers and book burnings. Unbroken spines, video chat, interim museum loans and the wyrm-father. Pretty creative story. I cannot divine if all the technology sited is real, partially true or purely a gift to the story...my brain had a blast with this one.not divine if all the technology sited is real, partially true or purely a gift to the story...my brain had a blast with this one.

B000HL2J0G|3.0|I never did see any episodes of MacGyver when it was first being broadcast, but my daughter and her husband told me how much they used to look forward to each installment. I have seen most of season one and not sure I will continue on. The basic plots are repetitious with MacGyver going to the rescue of a new beautiful woman each time and carrying out science based heroics which would have little chance of success in the real world. MacGyver is &#34;too good to be true&#34; with his aversion to guns and his unrealistic cool humor while under attack. The scenes are photographed well, especially the bright outdoor ones. The program was more contemporary in its time, but it lacks relevance against today's complex dramas.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Not what I was expecting but an entertaining read nonetheless. Not quite the typical autobiography but she breaks down her rather normal childhood with humorous tidbits of awkward moments ans snide comments on industry sexism.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, Candy Crush is on Kindle!!! This is one of the best games I have played. For some reason, the game keeps crashing when I try to play it on my phone. Thank you Amazon!!!
B00005UWMX|5.0|It is a favorite.  Acting is superb, story line is great.  We've been wanting to add this to our library for some time.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The game is really fun but hard to earn stuff like wood money and more and the fun part is you get to make your own town and you get to fish and also put animals on your town and on my game there was a guy who wanted to be a lumberjack and I couldn't do anything about it, and you only could change its name. And another thing is you could visit other people and of course they had a bigger place or town. Another thing is that you could hunt and kill animals like one time I killed a squirrel and it gave you food. Another thing is that you could extend your boundary of land to make a bigger town or even a city. And one more thing is that you could take money out of your building and put in food in the building in order to get the money and the game is kind of similar to the game wonder zoo, little big city,and ice age.

B0098QBEXO|5.0|It's a heart-warming story with some bumps along the way.  Young men dealing with the terminal illness of one of them.  Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing.  It is very painful in parts and some tough decisions have to be made.  Tissues will be needed!  I loved it.
B00005JLKN|5.0|This adaptation of Red Dragon is good but misses the mark that would have made it great except for one single performance by Emily Watson.  Her work here is incredible and she captures the literal wide-eyed innocence of her character so beautifully that she deserved an Oscar nomination.  It is simply astounding how she truly makes the audience believe it is a blind actress playing the role and she uses her uniquely beautiful eyes as if they were musical instruments that never miss a note.  The horror in them, the uncomprehending tenderness reflected in them, and a seductive playfulness that lights them up and the screen as well are all totally sublime.  This is a performance so perfect it is of historic importance to cinema and should be seen by anyone with a sincere interest in motion picture greatness.  You will be moved to tears by Ms. Watson and in the end, touched to your very soul so deeply that you will feel compelled to reach out to her in compassion and understanding.  A performance that moves one so powerfully that the audiences almost rises from its seats as one to intervene and to comfort the character portrayed is one to never be forgotten.  Whether the film is good or not is beside the point when it is graced by such a performance by Emily Watson.
B000FC10QG|5.0|Awesome biz book! The author did an excellent job of bringing life into the characters and their back stories. Highly recommended for people who like to read about business!
B00846REIS|4.0|With several similarities, you get that unique 50 shades feel that you've been missing since bidding Christian farewell.<br />Gideon & Eva :)
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|A fast paced and interesting plot. Good performances. Loved the surprise ending. Morgan Freeman is my hero.  Highly recommend it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|You will want to know the &#34;secret&#34; from the very beginning.  Could not put this book down.<br />Looking forward reading more from Kate Morton.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent Stephen King book. A quick read, I couldn't read it fast enough, I loved it!! I can not wait for the movie to be made bc this is an awesome story.
B00FEN000S|4.0|If you are new to this genre of film, then consider Pacific Rim a good introduction. Lots of action and good CGI. They could have been a little more consistent with scale and a little more realistic with the Science aspect (reactors just don't blow up like that one in the movie), but over all, very enjoyable.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love this show.  I love the tongue n cheek humor and the murder mystery challenges and<br />the charisma between the two actors and their support actors as well.  This show always<br />makes me smile and I can't always guess the ending, keep it up guys!
B000FA675C|5.0|If you haven't already read the book or seen the movie, this is a wonderful read.  It keeps you on your toes throughout the book and it's also interesting to get some historical European/Catholic/Templar Knights information.  Keep in mind, this is fiction so not all the &#34;historical facts&#34; are true, but it is fun!  Don't forget to read his other books about Robert Langdon as well!  If you have seen the movie but haven't read the book, read it! It's even better than the movie!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is actually really good . I have it on my Kindle Fire HD . And it's really good . It does all the basic maths . And yea . If I were gonna get a calculator app I'd use this one . Plus there are no annoying pop up adds . And it's free . I would recommend this to all of my friends .
B004J4XGN6|5.0|I read slow, I tend to back up a little bit between sessions, so it took me some time to get through, but I learned a LOT.  I learned some pointers here/there that I can take to heart for my own company, and I also got validation from some of the things I was already doing.  It is an easy read, well written, with an even tone without being too technical.  I really enjoyed reading this book.
B002GU605G|5.0|I have the original Love album but when I noticed there was an omnibus edition I didn't hesitate to buy it. This omnibus collection is a must for Love fans. The 4 CD's are very well wrapped up in cardbox and plastic to protect from scratches. I already listened to the whole thing and it's amazing. The booklet is very informative with interviews of the band members and notes along the lyrics. Love is up there with my favorite albums of all time. Brother Wolf Sister Moon your time has come...
B00FX8FQ76|4.0|No big surprises here, but I am a Katy Perry fan so it was just what I was looking for!
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|It is good I Think It Is The Best T.V Show Right Now . Maybe Ever or Even All Time Great
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Gets your inner Sherlock Homes going!  Played together with my teen-age son.  Sometimes 2 heads were better than one (lol).  Fun and challenging at the same<br />time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend.  Once I downloaded it and started playing I was hooked.  I have recommended it to others, but find that they already play it and love it.
B00BT0ZDF2|1.0|I bought this expecting to get a high quality video, seeing as how I am able to watch it free in HD on any other web site. When i played the movie, it might as well be in 240p. Completely wasted my time and money, and you can't return this either, so im stuck with wasted space.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I don't like the part where you have to wait for another life, other than that it's pretty good, thank you
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|great production, great cast, great show... Gabriel Macht is the man. His sidekick in P.A. is pretty B.A. too! Enjoy :)
B004UID2LC|5.0|I dont know about you guys but I didnt have an update<br />Although I cant watch movies and certain videos
031623480X|5.0|Really well done, written with passion, explains the science in plain language like only a really super-smart person can do.<br /><br />I would recommend people make this part of a two-book reading list also including Gary Taubes \\"Why We Get Fat\\" -- or his longer \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" -- which is a much more thorough explanation about the science and the history of science on obesity and carbohydrates.<br /><br />But Perlmutter's book is a terrific milestone of its own. Perlmutter is so eminently qualified and well connected, a practitioner, scientist and policy maker, he is harder to ignore than Taubes, who is just a journalist after all.<br /><br />Interestingly, Taubes is the more careful writer, more worried about the backlash, more conditional about his descriptions of the science.<br /><br />Perlmutter writes as someone who has, in recent years by reading the literature and through his own resaarch and practice, become 100 percent convinced that people are destroying their brains and bodies by eating the very diet that the American medical establishment recommends they eat!<br /><br />It is such a crime. It is almost too much to consider that corporate science and medicine (both perhaps well intented) have pushed these disastrous diet recommendations that led to arguably the two great health crises of our generation -- diabetes and Alzheimers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I place game on my kindle for my 3yr old grandson, because he love the movie Despicable Me the can't you how he has watched it. But game I been a life saver for me, I would give 10 stars if I could this the only that he will sit quietly and play.  Thank you little Minion
B008EL25LE|4.0|The game was fun with enough variety to keep it interesting,  but not too difficult for a senior citizen who is not that great at games.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the hardest books I have ever read due to the rawness of the story and characters. It is an amazing story written from the point of view of death. This also broadened my scope of death as a persona not only could I love death but also pitied him.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Alan Jackson does a great job with this album. His songs are true bluegrass, and his &#34;Blue Moon Over Kentucky&#34; should make Bill Monroe lovers proud. Great work.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Eric says &#34;The book was interesting and funny&#34;. Mom the Wimpy Kid series is fun to read aloud. This is our second time reading through the series and the entire family still laughs out loud. Greg and his family are very relatable!
B005XUC398|4.0|The develpment of the movie's premises were spellbinding.  the characters were at the same time believeably developed while their actions and decisions seemed incredulous.  Wall Street can easily be imagined as having a most similar array of individuals of varying forms of ambition and choices as to its fulfillment.
0887431453|5.0|Started with one or two pages a day, now he loves to work on it for long. He is even re-doing stuff.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|well, most people are probably not \\"reviewing this\\" since they are willing to rate it but not \\"review it. well, most people are probably not \\"reviewing this\\" since they are willing to rate it but not \\"review it.\\"
B0089LOG02|5.0|Had no idea about the orphan issues back then. Although why wouldn't there have been. People were dying left & right from so many things. Would definitely read more from this author!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really like playing this game, a lot of fun, everyone should play this game, you should try it you'll like it
B00CQZ65BU|5.0|Author does try to suggest that Cixi was a good person, in contrast to what other authors have written about her, as in not a murderer, or evil, but by the end of the book, she indicates that the empress killed her adopted son, and before,  Cixi had already commanded the murder of her adopted son's favorite concubine putting her in a well, not empty, of course. Overall, it is a good read, a must to learn about another period in Chinese history very very well told. Interesting not so popular facts shared in book: Cixi was a dog breeder, birds would seat on her arm, fish would seat in her palm, she could read your mind after just a few words, she only drank human milk- no kidding. We are actually catching on with the colostrum supplements now in the market- not human though.
0307271080|4.0|If I could give this 4.5 stars that would be a little more accurate but I'm going to round slightly downwards because I agree with another reviewer who said that the main character was written so as to appear virtually flawless and kind of preening, which was a bit annoying. However, that said, I really liked the smart, sharp witted writing and commentary on race and I couldn't put it down once I started it. I thought both portions of the story set in America and back in Nigeria were quite fascinating.  The author (and main character) have a quick wit that made it fun to read.
B00FPH6M82|4.0|I enjoyed this movie with my children.  While it was PG-13 it was suitable enough to watch with children younger than 13.  No foul language, no sexual/drug content (other than for legitimate wound healing or dealing with an otherwise &#34;alien&#34; world.  he violence dealt with the idea of a hostile planet with hostile animals (not all were) rather than just pointless fighting and carnage between humans.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching this movie about a boy and father who lost their sister/daughter in a previous war and how he is overcoming his own fears and feelings of inadequacies.  As well as the father coming to terms with the fact that he's been an excellent military man but an otherwise very distant and disconnected father.<br /><br />The scenes are fantastic, great colors, great detail, animals well made (CGI or otherwise).  It's definitely worth watching at least once.
1400069807|4.0|I have mixed feeling about this book.  It has some good information but the story telling is a bit dry at times.  IMHO, I think the book could have been half its size.  Neverthless, a good read.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|This film seems to echo much of my inner baseball geek's internal monologue.<br /><br />Though I tend to side with the Sabermetrically inclined, I do feel like there are some things that make players great that don't show up in a slash line, and this film humanizes this.<br /><br />Plus Clint Eastwood rules.
B003Y5H5FQ|4.0|If the above sounds like your idea of a good time, then have I got a movie for you. Figures that after dozens of bad horror remakes, a good one comes along and no one buys a ticket. Only intermittently scary, the focus of this remake is more on funny and fun, and the script by a former Buffy head writer achieves that goal in spades. Extra props to David Tennant for bringing his Whovian comedic timing to...well, a reincarnation of Spike, if you'd believe that. (Not in the undead way, just in the humor way.) Sure, the cinematography's occasionally too dark to see, but for once the 3D is appropriately used, mostly to beef up Buffy's original &#34;ashes&#34; effect for vampire deaths. Good stuff.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so hooked on my Candy Crush Saga game and was so disapointed that Amazon didn't have it so I didn't use my Kindle as much.  Now Amazon has the orginnal Candy Crush Saga and I can play on the same level as I have on my Laptop.  I love my Kindle Fire 7&#34; HD and now I love it more.  Way to go Amazon you rock.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great blu-ray transfers plus TONS of extras means no buyers' remorse for an Alien fan like me. Whichever film of the series you love most, there's at least a two-hour documentary about the making of it, and all of them go above and beyond the usual dvd-extra call of duty. Never seen a whippet in an Alien costume? This is the set for you.
B00332CWLW|4.0|What a fascinating array of characters.  The interweaving of the narrative; all linking back to the &#34;real live guy&#34; who really did walk between the world trade building is stunning in it's imagination.  It is a truly compelling read that I would not hesitate to recommend to lovers of good literature.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is tons off fun play on computer all the time now it on kindle so i can play on both devices
0316322407|5.0|My daughter was very excited to receive this book. She has only read the first few pages but she is very much enjoying it. I will update this review once she has read the entire book.
0785156593|5.0|If you are like me you did some research after you saw the Avengers to find out who that purple guy was and what his deal is. Look no further this book will tell you all you need to know and more. This comic is one of the mot fun I have had reading in along time and and super hero fan needs to read this book.
B00FKQ38OE|4.0|As always, the new McCartney album doesn't disappoint!  Love the varied musical styles, he doesn't get stuck in a rut.  Leave it to Paul to pair up with young musicians and employ a younger sound for himself.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Game is very fun my only dislike is waiting for lives but understand d why it must be done. A great waste of time
B00915G6SU|5.0|The video arrived ahead of time and very well packed. Keeping up with my series like N.C.I.S. that arrived with Criminal Mines. Good price as well
B00005JM02|5.0|I never get tired of watching this movie, I think I use my grandkids as an excuse to watch it :)
B00915G6MG|5.0|The video arrived ahead of time and very well packed. Keeping up with my series like Criminal Minds that arrived with N.C.I.S. Good price as well!
0439023513|5.0|This is the final book of the hunger game trilogy. It is well written and will have you at the edge of your seat.  Easy read and hard to put down.
B00422LESO|5.0|No spoilers here  :)<br /><br />Do you love Pride and Prejudice in one form or another?  I'm a fan of the book, I liked the BBC version but I'm in love with the HBO version of Pride and Prejudice.  It's one of the only movies I could just watch over and over again contently.  It makes my heart skip a beat when Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth argue in the rain.  I hold my breath when he comes walking in the sunrise.  I love it.  I can't get enough.<br /><br />If you consider yourself a Jane Austen or Pride and Prejudice fan, then I highly recommend Austenland.  It is a super easy and FUN read.  Shannon Hale is clever and so entertaining.  I was literally laughing out loud and loved her characters.  I think she did a FABULOUS job creating a fun world where one can revisit Jane Austen's novels and see them from a present day comical viewpoint.<br /><br />Austenland is a romantic comedy, its one of my new favorites.  I read it twice and then went and saw the movie (which was also highly entertaining).  And if you love it be sure to check out her follow-up book - &#34;Midnight in Austenland&#34; - it was awesome.
B0001I561E|5.0|Another classic that will never go out of style, I took my son to see it in the theatre when he was two, and now we enjoy watching with his kids :)
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I would not recommend this book unless you are a fan of stores like lord of the rings or mystic tales.  It's use of mysticism and fanaticism are an unwelcome distraction for someone preferring historical fiction
0439023491|5.0|This is book two of the hunger game, and if you read book one, you know how good it is, you will not be disappointed. Lots of action. And the end will have you craving book three :)
1465408681|5.0|DK creates wonderful books for children, and their LEGO offerings are no exception.  Like the others, this one includes an exclusive minifigure that can't be found in other LEGO sets.  The quality of the book is spectacular; it has vibrant, colorful pictures and has a lot of appeal for young readers, LEGO enthusiasts, and Star Wars fans alike.  The price on Amazon makes this book a great gift.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Great movie to watch for all ages, I remember watching it with my son, and now we enjoy watching now with his son, my grandson :)
0756697875|5.0|Yes, this guide features mostly Batman, as it is the brunt of LEGO's DC line, but you'll find no complaints here.  DK is at it again with their excellent LEGO books, and this suit features a special Batman minifigure not available elsewhere.  The book itself is well bound, and sturdy enough for young readers.  A parents only qualm with this book might come with having to explain why many of the sets are no longer available, unless someone wants to hazard a very expensive aftermarket.  A must read, must buy for any fan of DKs LEGO Visual Dictionaries.
B000F8O35U|5.0|One of my kids favorite and now, one of my grandkids favorite.  Great movie to enjoy with adults and children
B007T7MIR0|1.0|I was misguided into  getting this. It does not allow you to edit documents but only to view .<br />It prompts you to buy the professional version.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Cute family movie and funny. My daughter and I enjoyed it! We laughed together and there is not much more a dad can want!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Too bad its not widely supported by other software..<br />The picture quality from youtube and netflix is great.<br />Hope we get support for more services and better access to local media on pc.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love and hate this game! I'm addicted. I play on 4 different devices. Some levels are really hard but I can't stop
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|All the people in in my class play candy crush saga. I downloading the game at this very minute. If there is a guy out there and his name is Nicholas White read this review.ASAP!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is fun but some stations take to long to complete.It is goo for most ages. Just give me something to do when I am board.
B00F56AZK4|1.0|I found it to easy to do, thought it would be a lot harder and have more pictures to choice from.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Please buy this product if you have an Apple Macbook Pro laptop, it is great for presentations! I recommend this product!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I like this book because it is a love/action/crazy story that amazed me more than any of the other books that I read from Amazon.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|I use it to watch shows on my HD television from my laptop all the time!  I recommend this product to anyone!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I luv luv luuuv,this game I would TOOTS (totally) play it everyday!I would really recommend it for my daughter. (FYI  I am writing in a language that kids these days know how to read).P.S I AM A GROWN CHILD I AM OLD (getting there),SO ENJOY YOUR YOUTH WHILE YOU CAN!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|An innovative game which allows you to exercise your problem-solving skills. It's entertaining, keeps you alert, and is challenging without being too difficult or frustrating.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Very easy to down load and was an instant pleasure for my boys would recommend it to any one :)
B00002438V|5.0|This is a great performance of a infrequently played piece. I read that this is the piano part that a Czech pianist, Vilém Kurz, re-composed to make it less of a leading part and more of an opposing soloist role. Richter was such an astounding pinaist with rare technical clarity, and Carlos Klieber was such a fabulous conductor. The combination made for a great recording.<br /><br />The Schubert Wanderer Fantasy is, as expected, also amazingly well performed. Highly recommend this album if only for the Wanderer Fantasy. You will get the added bonus of a great performance of a piano concerto you likely have not heard before.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book renders me speechless.  I was ambushed by it as I read it having had no warning of its real story line.  Yet I was glued to it.  I will only say beware if you decide to read it.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|This is a fun movie if you just want to watch a lot of people setting up silly Zach Galifianakis jokes or uncomfortable yet funny situations. I probably won't watch this one again, though I would watch the first one again on the right occasion.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|Fast, just Google AMD A10-6800K Overclocked To 8203.34 MHz, Breaks And Sets World Record, paired this with a 660 ti vid. card, 550 psu, 8gb 2400 ram, will be soon upgrading to 32 gb 2400 ram , and the Titan vid. next.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very inspirational book<br />Funny<br />Want to read it one more time<br />I could never finish secret but could finish this one
1451666179|5.0|I am a fan of the Hyperbole and a Half blog and I pre-ordered the paperback version of this book when I heard it was going to be available. That meant it was waiting at my door yesterday. I laughed and cried my way through this thing and could not put it down until I finished it.<br /><br />For those familiar with Allie's blog, this is just like it (except you can't make comments in it, well you can, but no one will respond). Except: it has some stuff that was not on the blog, and therefore this is greater. Awesomer.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Hyperbole and a Half - Allie writes autobiographical stories with illustrations. And they are hilarious. Even when she is talking about depression.<br /><br />I have a Kindle, and a Kindle Fire, but I bought this book analog, because of the pictures. And I am glad I did. Of course now I might need to buy it on Kindle so I can bring it with me everywhere I go.<br /><br />Also: CAKE.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|i play this app every day and it passes time very efficiently and there is enough levels to last me a long time
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Love this story as it is the kind of sad and happy mix that is so much like life.  I dread the ending (am halfway through) as I am rooting for the hero  but being a realist  I doubt that it will have the happy ending  I would love.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Good special effects, fun premise, and told well. The cast make it work well.<br /><br />...and, Thor's chest to gaze upon.  YUM!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My fellow van pool riders have been playing the game on the way to work.  I saw a TV commercial advertising Candy Crush Saga so decided to download for FREE!  It's so much fun, I don't want to stop playing when I arrive at the office.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|\\"Don't be afraid--if you are afraid, you can't move forward.\\"...Malala Yousafzai<br /><br />Far too often I take my life for granted, yet all I need do is read something like this to make me sit back and count my blessings--to try and truly appreciate the personal freedoms and liberties I so rarely even consider because these things are just so \\"natural\\" in the society I live in.<br /><br />What can I say about this book except, wow?  Here is a young girl, like any other young girl, who reads vampire novels, watches silly movies, laughs with her friends, and goes to school with the dream of a better future in her heart.  Yet with the everyday struggle she and her countrymen must endure under the constant Taliban threat, political instability, and corruption in a war-torn impoverished nation, still she retains her faith, her pride, her patriotism, and the strength of her convictions which ultimately leads to the attempt on her life.  Any writer of fiction could only wish to come up with a story this powerful, for it is one of both courage and heart, and a true education in the power of a dream within a deadly, oppressive religious regime.<br /><br />An insightful and gripping story.  This young ambassador of education is inspiring and would make an excellent role model for anyone in a crusade for human rights.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I have really enjoyed all 4 seasons of this show.  I think the story lines are fascinating and the acting above average
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|simple, easily covered tunes that stick in your head.<br />compellilng story lines, too<br />Recommended by teenage girl, discovered on pop radio, but heard on alternative stations, and enjoyed by old guys, too.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If you're looking for a simple guideline to boost your insight into what life has to offer and to your inner ability to create your reality in this sometimes confusing world, this is the book that will show you how to harness your inner power and to connect to the Whole. With simple and fun narrative, Pam shows what a wonderful, fun and powerful experience life can be. Thank you Pam for showing up in the lives of people to share this amazing and fun information and exercises, God Bless.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|I love the new case. It's simple, sleek, and cool looking. I love the color. Spigen products are great quality, that's why I keep purchasing their products.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I have been stuck on level 23 and I don't think you can get pass it  I would only have 3 more matches then would end have ask friends for lives.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|It was mildly entertaining, quick read. I've read worse, and I've read better. That's why I rated it three stars.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My girls just love this game, their favorite every time they use the Kindle. We got it as the free app of the day, well worth it :)
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Dan Brown uses his same recipe to make another best seller... even if it was just &#34;okay.&#34; It was decent. It took forever to get into it, but once it got going, I was able to stay entertained.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It is just as good the second time around. Walter Bishop is a fine actor and Olivia Dunham is as intense as ever.
B004J09ONG|5.0|Love this movie! Great for family and animal lover's entertainment. Nice to see good family value entertainment on the screen.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I always watched Ghost Whispers when it was a series but I missed the final season and I was so happy to get this.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|The dad, Nick Cage's character, was my favorite altho Guy was a close second.  Wonderful art and animation and laugh out loud parts. I'm sure it's supposed to be for kids but I don't have any (small ones) and I enjoyed it very much!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was a total waste of time and money. I am mystified at how it ever created such buzz.
B0047E9TRA|4.0|This is a classic movie that tells about a young, shy girl that grew up with kinetic powers, and used it against mean students at school after continued tormenting and abuse.  It was sad that nobody understood her and died in a tragic fire.  I felt like watching this movie again in case I see the recent Carrie reproduction.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This series is simple, predictable, but enjoyable.  They do a nice job with the special effects to make everything seem real.  Perect show for kicking back and relaxing after a hard day at work.
B00BKRON5K|5.0|This was a very special book full of great information. It will change your way of thinking about food and what is<br />&#34;real&#34; food and what is not.
1250038820|5.0|Seriously....you need to buy this book. 400 portraits with random stories and captions. I'm only 15 pages in and I'm in love! You'll laugh, you'll cry...buy it. It's well worth the money for sure. Can't wait for another volume to come out. :)
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved it thats all i can say i loved it. I used to hate reading but this book drew me in and now i love to read.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Enjoyed this book. Lots of separate stories all come together because of one event. Good depiction of female friendships and the impact of motherhood.  Well developed characters. Easy to see why this book was on the NY Times best seller list!
067144901X|5.0|This is a great book for my 3 year old daughter.  Perfect for bed time and its a thick quality board book that stands up to her flipping through it after we're done.  I've bought several of her books and haven't been disappointed.
B00336C3EY|2.0|Mildly entertaining... Really, it was ok, but not worth the time it took to watch it...It seemed like just a waste of time and actor's talents
0060254920|5.0|This is a bed time favorite.  We love the story, the drawings, just everything.  It is so neat to read my daughter the stories I loved growing up.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have watched all three seasons several times just to look for things I missed in previous viewings and I missed a lot. I could watch this series over and over and I don't really know exactly why. The British are so much better at series than we Americans. I can't wait to see what happens with no Matthew at Downton. I can't wait to see what happens years into the future at Downton so I hope it stays on for a long, long time.
B00FRMDH7Y|5.0|My kids loved this movie. Super cute and funny. Highly recommend for a family night. Great for all ages and especially five year old little boys. Lol
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Was almost afraid to pick up this book, fearing disappointment. Now can tell you that I thought it was a great sequel to The Shining. As always, Mr. King has developed his characters fully to keep you invested throughout the novel. This was a most enjoyable and scary read.
006202406X|1.0|Huge disappointment. This third installment deviated from the incredible standard the first two books established. The dual narrative was very confusing, as Tris' and Tobias' voices are really similar. The book starts out telling you that the whole world that was established in Divergent and Insurgent was false. Making everything Tris et. al. accomplished in the other books seem meaningless.<br />Also I frequently forgot whose POV I was reading and had to flip back to the beginning of the chapter. It really felt like a chore to read.<br />There was no build up to some exciting climax like the other two books (like invading Erudite HQ). It was more like an account of event- &#34;this happened, and then this, then this, then this&#34; There was a lack of detail and explanation; everything felt rushed and the whole book, despite being the longest in the series (I think?) felt compressed. There was not enough explanation about Tris' mother. Matthew, Nita, and David all felt one-dimensional. Uriah and Tori's deaths felt really arbitrary and felt like they didn't have a meaning. Evelyn's complete 180 made absolutely no sense. She gave in after Tobias just asks her after spending the entire book as the determined leader of the factionless?<br />I don't really have a problem with the death of a protagonists, as long as it is well done. I thoroughly enjoyed books like The Book Thief and The Fault in Our Stars. If the characters had not died in these books, it would have felt fake. The way Roth killed Tris, was poorly executed. It made Tris seem like a very static character. Her choice to sacrifice herself for Caleb was very predictable and contrived. It didn't feel like the ultimate act of selflessness, it felt like something she would have done since the very beginning of the series. Also were all the character deaths necessary? It almost felt unrealistic that nothing really worked out for *anyone* in the end.<br />Sorry this is really disorganized. Just wanted to express my frustrations for what should have been an excellent conclusion to a beloved series.<br />Not looking forward to the movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|They should do a movie about this one for sure . I love his writing style, it keeps you captivated.
B00G32OMF8|5.0|If you like the previous two installments, you will like this one.  I recommend watching them all within a week or two.
0060853972|5.0|Absolutely hysterical!  A misplaced anti-christ thanks to the Chattering Order of St Beryl is just the beginning of this comical tale of Armageddon.  The combined efforts of Crowley and Aziraphale to prevent it from happening only add to the laughs.  The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse are now the Four Motorcycle persons of the Apocalypse.  And a Hell hound is doing tricks.for treats.  From beginning to end non-stop humor and laughter.  Once started, you cannot put it down till the end.
0446563048|5.0|I am not much of a reader, but I read this entire book on 2, 2 hour flights. It is now one of my favorite and I highly recommend it to anyone.
B00F880BWG|5.0|This is my FAVORITE show.  I love it.  I only wished it would be on every day lol.  Great acting. Great story.  I love the complexity of the characters.
B00E9P959O|4.0|The vocals seem a little bare, but that doesn't bother me.  The bass and guitar aren't in the way of each other.  I think that's great.  The drum mixes are all messed up.  Key example:  Stars look down has the bass and snare jacked up, but the ride cymbal work is far buried (during the &#34;what is the meaning of this?&#34; part).  It does change the over all feel of the song.  I believe that this wouldn't have happened if Neil Peart were to have worked on the remixing, but he didn't because it was too painful to go back and look at this album with all of the stuff that was going on in his life at that time.  It's still a good Rush album, just the drums seem to be on the backburner in this one where the guitar and bass are brought out nicely.  I play drums, guitar, and bass so I'm two thirds of the way happy!  That's why I gave it 4 instead of 5.
B001BANK32|5.0|There are so many 5 star reviews of this book that my .02c is superfluous, but for the record, the book is riveting. I bought it when it came out and have re-read it a couple of times since (something I never really do with mass market fiction).  I highly recommend it to fans of the genre and of Stephen King. No writer today tells a horror story better than he.  This is the wonderful thing about him:  He tells the story first and foremost. And that's what allows us to engage with book and suspend reality for a time.  He is a storyteller par excellence, and this one of his very best.  Check out Stanley Kubrick's movie version - also excellent.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So hard to stop playing need to get a hobby it also makes me hungry I just wish the music was cooler
B0089EHWQE|5.0|My daughter recommended this book and I am glad I listened to her and read it. I hated to see it end.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I love Richard Gere and this movie really tugs at your heart strings. Its a very good movie and a nice addition to my collection..
B00571F26Y|4.0|very pertinent information. appreciate the details from an internist author. I am now off wheat, in hopes of stopping my Hashimotos and improving my general health.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I look forward to playing this to relax. It helps to make my days more enjoyable and entertaining. I recommend it to my friends.
B009M2T7K6|5.0|My granddaughter loves The Little Mermaid ~ Her favorite Disney Princess.  This Barbie was made for her.  She loves the fact that the tail changes color and can \\"swim\\" with her in the bathtub.
B00005V9IL|1.0|The discs are scratched up and the merchandise arrived without the dvd case which they failed to inform me about. The dvd works but the ad said it was in &#34;very good&#34; condition and it most certainly was NOT.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Ive invited other friends who have become addicted to this fun game! If games keep us young then my 74 years should be back to infancy by now.! I like that I can interact with others to keep the game going when I run out of &#34;lives&#34;. Another favorite is Papa Pear.  Keep these coming, they are keeping us thinking and having fun! The only downside is the annoying way all those ads run on the sides & bottom of the games. I'd be willing to pay for ad-free games. Those advertisers must be desperate to be so annoying.! All they do is turn me off their product!
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|As with all things produced by Fantasy Flight, quality is paramount. Graphics are precise and clean. The user interface is well thought out and easy to use. Sound effects and music are top notch and provide an excellent experience for a Lovecraftian horror-style game. FFG also does a great job of implementing the original game's artwork into the transitions. It's very easy to get into the mood and theme in this version.<br /><br />Those users familiar with the original board game will be able to pick this up and dive right in. Those unfamiliar benefit from well-designed tutorials. The game does make some minor changes to the board game rules due to it's electronic nature, but nothing so major as to confuse veteran players.<br /><br />The game offers additional, paid add-ons and while they are appealing, they are not required to play this game. There is a full game here with four Ancient Ones and 16 investigators to choose from.<br /><br />Though this version of the game is designed for solo play, it is turn-based and can be played with others via the play-and-pass method. It plays from one to four investigators.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of the Chtulu mythos and/or enjoys random dice-based games.<br /><br />Also, a special thanks to FFG for being one of the first board game companies to port their products to Android instead of just to iOS.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This may challenge your orthodoxy, but will, most likely, deepen your faith in<br />Jesus Christ.  A vey compelling book. Very well researched and written.
B008JFUNHI|5.0|I've been waiting for this one since I read the book in 1985! To me, the casting is perfect and the ambitious production values match the book's phenomenal success. If you've read it you know this is Nirvana for a lover of computer generated imaging: Space ships, free floating trainees in a gravity-free environment, a decimated planet, futuristic living quarters, the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Ender is so called because in this future world, families are only allowed two children: He is a third, AND he is gifted. This has not slipped past the powers that be, because they need a gifted new tactician to help them destroy their sworn enemy.<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Harrison Ford (\\"Indiana Jones\\" and \\"42\\") is Colonel Graff, absolutely determined to annihilate the enemy, once and for all; collateral damage can go to blue blazes. Once again, Ford has to earn his salary: He is saddled with a few bits of really lame dialogue.<br />  * Asa Butterfield (\\"Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" and \\"Hugo\\") is our eponymous hero: intelligent, ethical and focused. He has to straddle the gap between the teenage world of bullying and the adult world of interplanetary warfare. This talented kid must have a terrific agent!<br />  * Viola Davis (\\"The Help\\" and \\"Prisoners\\") is Major Gwen Anderson, the only heart in a heartless situation. This actress always impresses me; there is a moment as she leaves a room... BRILLIANT!<br />  * Hailee Steinfeld (\\"True Grit\\" and \\"Romeo and Juliet\\") is Ender's friend Petra, she's there for him when he's assigned a hostile classroom. Petra is a better role for Steinfeld than Juliet.<br />  * Ben Kingsley (\\"Hugo\\" and \\"Iron Man 3\\") is Mazer Rackham, a seasoned fighter drafted to coach our youngster in the ways of the enemy. Why did they choose this accent for this character? ...hmmm...<br /><br />Rated PG-13, youngsters can see other youngsters fight an intergalactic battle (the rest of us will suspend disbelief). To me, all the CGI in the world is no substitute for a good story. Here, courtesy of writer/director Gavin Hood (\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\"), we have a really good story, albeit a bit far-fetched, so the CGI works just fine for me. The cinematography by Donald McAlpine offers everything from battling spaceships to Butterfield's eyelashes.<br /><br />I'm ready for the obvious sequel. I'll have a set of three DVDs from Amazon before they are finished with this series.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I downloaded the movie pretty easily. I like that we can click and watch. Wish it was in HD but the quality wasn't too bad.
B005DWBO0K|5.0|The restoration is impeccably done and doesnt detract at all from the pure genious of this early film. Nothing compares.<br />in the horror genre
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game only one problem though,  I just can't put it down!!! Very easy to get addicted to. Would recommend this game to friends and family.
B00D48BSBA|5.0|Nobody better in the genre for journalistic, intelligence related fiction. Worth a read to all those interested in how the special forces and intelligence teams work together.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft it is so awesome  best game ever if you do not buy it you will be sad
B00701L5XS|5.0|This app is as fun to watch as it is to follow along to!  Best way to learn to tie knots that I have found by far!  It is easier to follow the steps than it is to watch in person or on video (for me personally).
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The first two books were brilliantly done with wonderful characters and a definite flair for story telling. However, that was not the case with Allegiant. The storyline is completely changed as well as the method for telling the story. Not good changes. Things do start to improve with the storytelling about chapter 42 however and by the end, you feel like Roth has reclaimed some of her writings former appeal, but by then the story is over. There will not be another in this series, and the readers feel cheated. Stick with the first book, or even the first two and pretend the story ends there. You'll be better off. I hope Roth doesn't change her writing method in the middle of something ever again. It was painful.
B00G8YZ48K|5.0|I would recommend this episode (and show) to anyone who enjoys human drama or Zompocalypse related media, comics, or books.  The characters are extremely developed, well written, acted.  I gave this episode 5 stars, but I would also give the series as a whole the exact same rating.  The show is engaging, thought provoking, and emotionally binding.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Those who like King, and really want to know what happened to little Danny Torrence will like this book. The plot is a bit predictable. And as usual with King, the ending a bit anticlimactic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive fun!!!! The levels range from easy to frustrating! If you get stuck on a particularly challenging level go to crushingcandies.com for tips!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This fulfilled the need for a good novel with just enough suspense to keep the reader interested. It sounds like a good series and one that the reader will probably want to continue.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This is definitely a classic. I have seen it in the movie theatre many times and on VHS and now I purchased my very own DVD. I will also share it with another of my movie buff friends. I am amazed that he hasn't seen it. This movie was on the screen at the Westgate Theatre in Edina, MN for something like two years running and then I went to their second year premiere and saw Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort in person on stage at the theatre. Maybe it is a film that some people will just not get, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and continue to enjoy it. The Cat Stevens background music is also great.
1451696191|1.0|I grew way to frustrated with the main character to even finish the book, the kid was crying on every other page. In addition, it seemed like the author was trying way to hard to cram this book with teenage drama.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|I think that everyone should read this book. Everyone. Especially adolescent boys & girls. I could hardly put it down.  I started it on a late Sunday & finished Wednesday morning. Can a book save a life?  Maybe.  If one can, this one might.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the game but some time's it's hard but will keep playing it so play on have fun.<br /><br />Don't give up.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DONJXE4|5.0|Simply stated, Joe Cocker is like a fine wine.  He seems to get better with age.  This is Cocker at the pinnacle of his craft.  An amazing song line up and a voice that belts out every tune with a passion that is fired up like no other time in his career.  The tightest live band of all time.  Rolling Stone Magazine, you should put this one in your Top 100 Albums of all time.  A must have CD for your collection.  You'll listen to this one over and over and over again!  Thank you Mr. Cocker for your finest work yet.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|Much faster power up than previous model.  Fixed my problem immediately & the price was right.  Co tiniest to love my kindle
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game, totally addicted to it now, only hate that I have to wait sooooo long between lives! But otherwise love it.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I bought this because it seems when I drive there is always more than one person (including myself) who wants / needs to charge their iPhone. It works great with two iPhone at once, as advertised the UBS jack for iPhone charges the iPhone slightly faster, but honestly unless you really focus on it you don't notice much of a difference in charging times. It works great and I highly recommend it, especially for long trips!
B006BQNJR8|4.0|One of the best Conan movies that I have seen.  Some violence and sex, I would not recommend it for children.
B0064MGU98|5.0|One of the best dramas I have seen. The characters have so much depth and they aren't in a hurry to get it all out there in season one. Season two is just as good as one!!!
B007VTUYWW|4.0|Most people has seen Tomb Raider before, this is just to see it again.  Definitely entertaining and cannot go wrong with this.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|WOW, this was a powefrful novel.  The author wrote in such a way that I felt as if I were a part of the lives of  of the people in Afghanastain.  THe way different peoples lives were woven through their history and the way families took care of each other really gave me a new insight into a culture different than the one Iive in.  Thank you Khaled ad I am going to be reading more of your books.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|It's a different feel at the beginning than the rest of the seasons, it's a fresh new perspective and it works. It is slower to build than the previous seasons though, but the storyline is still good! Can't wait for future episodes!!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book sucks  I wish I could explode this book. This book sucks and you people should be ashamed of your selves.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Easy and fun to read. Love to read mysteries set in Europe, about World War II.  Beautiful description of life in Southern France.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I don't understand why there is a book number 4. This is not over, omg - if I want to know the end I have to buy book number 4.
B008Q00PHY|5.0|This movie is great to view on Blu-ray.  I watched it on my Kindle Fire and it did not do it justice.
B000GOWNPU|5.0|Compelling story of loyalty, childhood tragedy, and correctional oppression.  The selection of actors is first rate.  It is presented as a true story, but the authorities claim fiction.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game rocks!! I'm obsessed! There are a few things.... Some characters are so expensive in game coins that it's impossible to get the coins!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is such a fun app.  There are all kinds of really great ideas on this site and this app gives you access to this great site on your kindle.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|This needs to be the last time they make this movie.  I will say that the plot is ever so slightly different than the first two, but that's not saying much.<br /><br />Also, if you do not generally find appreciation for comically small male genitalia, turn the movie off immediately when the credits start.
0525478817|5.0|This was suggested school reading for our daughter's middle school.  My daughter liked it so much that she picked up another book by John Green and devoured that as well.  We've just ordered two other books by John Green for her birthday.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Scariest movie ever!  Jack Nicholson is the perfect psycho next to the damsel in distress played awesomely by Shelley Duvall.  A horror classic!!!
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I like it a lot. Very fast passed once you get the hang of it. Nice way to pass breaktime
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Their best album since Yield, and possibly the most complete. I was lucky enough to see them live again last night and was blown away!
0802473156|5.0|this book makes you think, gives you ideas and sparks good conversation between married couples. I would recommend it to anyone that is married. My husband and I were not having problems when we read it, and it enhanced our relationship. My husband does not particularly like to read and he said, 'it's an easy read', 'it was enjoyable'. Lots of stories to illistrate ideas and theories.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love that I can play it on the kindle seems I play it more now than I did on my phone
B009WUBERW|5.0|I always hoped to see all my favorite macho men together. Yea, they are older, but so am I. I will probably watch it again.<br /><br />Linda in NJ
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, addicting game, but I don't like that you need Facebook friends to help you unlock levels.  You do have the option to unlock levels with cash, but I don't like that either.  Plus, their whole system of receiving and sending notifications and help requests does not seem to work right.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I found the history of the manor that was used. I liked the fact that the current countess narrated it

1451666179|5.0|I've had this book a whole day and I've already read it cover to cover.  It's just as good as the blog.  God of Cake never fails to make me laugh but the new story about the Parrot had me cracking up in public.  I should have known not to read in public but I was so caught up.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Full of action and adventure! Tons of twists and turns nobody could expect! Once you start reading you won't be able to put it down.
1118490371|5.0|This book is very well explained and perfect for some one who doesn't have a good background in programming. I've been reading it for about 2 months and I can easily perform different tasks using VBA.<br /><br />I also should mention that knowing VBA can really distinguish you from any other person in you career since it makes everything much easier! I strongly recommend start learning VBA using this well structured, easy and inexpensive book.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 continued to offer interesting and credible storylines including insight into how society viewed the roles of females and how class structures changed during this time in history.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This well-written and emotional novel tells of the &#34;orphan trains&#34; and the sad children who were transported to the Mid-West to be placed in &#34;good&#34; homes.  I had never known about this part of American history.  While this is a fictional story, there are certainly real-life scenarios that are at least as heartbreaking if not worse.  I enjoyed the majority of the book, in spite of so much cruelty to the destitute children, although the ending was way too trite.  The story wrapped up with a &#34;happily ever after&#34; final chapter that was at odds with the dramatic arc of the story.
B001OKKRSK|5.0|Iconic performances by Taylor and Burton. The subject matter is dark, but the acting is superb. I watch this movie every few years just to remind me what a marriage shouldn't be like.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use Face Book and I love it. That's it. I don’t bother with others this quite sufficient  HAVE FUN

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As being a girl who has lost a friend at a young age to cancer, I know what this is like. To lose your loved one. I cried horribly when Augustus died. For I could feel Hazels pain. Now only. What happened to hazel. I know she died someday. Most likely pretty soon after. But what become of her? Just another infinity slightly greater than Augustus' infinity? I'll wonder forever.
1781162646|5.0|cut to the chase-Im a big Stephen King fan and I love everything he writes. This is a great book.
006202406X|3.0|I will have to say, this was fairly entertaining, but not as riveting as the first. I feel in general that the series went down hill from the first. Don't get me wrong--I was entertained. But there were some issues, too.<br /><br />On a positive note? We find out what's going on, big picture. I like that. Except it opens doors to bigger pictures, like what is going on internationally? In our world, everything is becoming so internationalized, I can't believe this USA is so isolated as to not effect the rest of the world.<br /><br />The character development in this one was not as good. What made Divergent so good was Tris and her uniquely human character. She was imperfect and that made her a great character. But this one was all roses and butterflies--cheesy love scenes and easy make ups. I suppose she may have grown as a character, but part of who she was included being impulsive, unforgiving, survivalist. I like the idea of switching perspectives, but I agree with every other review that comments the two POVs were completely indistinguishable. Often I would get confused and have to go back and check which POV I was reading because I was thinking it was a different one (I am a fast reader and skimped the title pages of the chapters a bit, I suppose). But if I have to check, then how can I tell if the characters are different. It felt more like a third person narrative from two POVs, written in first person.<br /><br />SPOILER--As for her dying, I guess I'm conflicted. Part of me thinks that was kind of necessary to make it not a perfect ending. Part of me thinks it's kind of crappy. I like the idea posed by one reader to have had the memory serum work on her, but that doesn't mesh with her resistance to other serums. Still, would have blended the bitter with the sweet (a little \\"The Vow,\\" if you will).<br /><br />Overall, worth reading as part of the series. But if you stop at Divergent, that's not a bad move either.
B00ET47USI|5.0|had a little problem when first downloaded but a chat with Amazon cleared that right up.<br />I love the little characters.  Great game
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Best $35 i have ever spent! Effectively turn your old (HDMI equipped) TV into a smart TV! Great idea, and works as advertised, I can't recommend it enough!
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|I like to play as well but sadly, it is pretty hard for me.  Okay, so I'm now the techy grandma I have wished to be.<br />I have caused the untimely death of dozens of hut dwelling cartoony guys.  Sad
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Angry Birds Star Wars is a lot of fun to play. Great characters reminds me of the movie wonderful challenges.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I bought this for my son, but I read what he does so he can talk about the books he is reading.  This is a fun book, the characters are likable and interesting and this version of a dystopian world is unique and interesting.
1449410243|5.0|This book is hilarious!<br />My wife and I love pulling this out to read and look at all the hilarious drawings!<br />Highly recommended for any fun reading!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Having lived in the south for several years I found this novel very interesting as I lived there in the 60's.  Anyone who thinks these kinds of stories are not a real reflection of what those times in history were really like  -is just not facing reality.  Could the ending have been different - no.  It's like many stories, fiction or not.  I would have given it five stars but as lifetime reader I have read some that were better for which I must reserve my five.
B00FPH3YQA|1.0|this is one of the worst movies we have ever seen.  right there with mac gruber.  Melissa McCarthy is the only bright spot.  I ended up hoping all the other characters would meet their demise.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's so easy to use. I have downloaded several books & love the quick, easy access the site gives me to all the books I can read.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I Loved it, i didn't figure the twist until very near the end, and then I couldn't put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Play it, it's super addicting. Have to get back to playing, talk later. Okay this review has to be longer, so now go play!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I liked the story, as it related to The Shinning of years ago.  Another great King novel.  He still can put chills on the back of your neck.
B007QJ8VBI|5.0|Great way to get U.S. news as well as foreign news.  Keep up with celebrity news as well.  I recommend to all.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I wasn't looking for fancy, or features. This watch feels quality and long lasting. Although this watch needs to be wound after sitting idle for long days, it doesn't take too much work to get it going and it tells time well. Best advise is to set your time, day, date during early morning, to make sure they don't switch in the middle of the day.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I play it with my granddaughter when she spends the weekend.  Great to connect with her on a level playing field.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I really like these kind of puzzles, and this app in particular is a lot of fun.  The only reason I don't give it that last star is because there's no &#34;help/clue&#34; options for when you're stuck, and the pictures are not that interesting/unoriginal.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Gave as a gift to my Daughter's family and they enjoyed it very much and the gift was a hit with them!
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|It's a good concept, but it's limited in it's ability.  There's only so many &#34;spirograph&#34; like pictures you can make without getting completely bored of this app.
B000MV9026|5.0|I sent this cute movie to my grandson and he just loved it and trying to walk like a penguin!  I am glad that I bought it.
B000SGSU58|4.0|Michael Connelly does not use flashbacks, alternate points of view, stream of consciousness, or any of the other tricks of the trade which constitute much of the last 100 years of story telling.  He writes straight ahead with no detours.  Most writers who try this wind up buried in a literary slab of concrete like the blonde in the title.<br />Hieronymous Bosch is a LA homicide detective who pursues his cases with a fervor that allows no side tracking.  Bosch has issues, big ones, but they inform his zeal for his work and parallel the issues that police work entails.  Cops are portrayed as full fleshed human beings and none of them are quite good enough for Bosch, even the few he admires and trusts.  Connelly is masterful at creating a police procedural with its plodding linear quality while incorporating a credible and sustainable whodunit.  A difficult task which Connelly appears to manage with ease.<br />Michael Connelly was a police reporter fifteen years.  That experience seems to have given him the ability to understand and portray cops with honesty.  Connelly is a fine writer who transcends this genre and does so without trickery or cleverness.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I took it off my Kindle Fire after I accidently downloaded it.  Have no interest in it what so ever.  Sorry never played it so I can not give a objective review.
B0052GACNM|5.0|great. great. great great great. What more can I cay. This CD is incredible. they are a tradition now while opening Christmas gifts. Come join the fun. Who's with me?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Grandson loaded this onto Kindle Fire, said Grandma you need to keep your mind sharp....LOL  This is chanllenging and I have really enjoyed it.  Can only get to level 8 but love it.
B000002LR3|5.0|this cd has some awesome songs suitable for all ages and spanning all genres . I have played this for the last 20 years and all the kids think it is cutting edge.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|It is okay I would not have put it on my Kindle but my Grandson said it was fun.  It is okay I would not discount it.  If you enjoy quick response games you will enjoy this app.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|these cds are excellent. I have them at home, in the car, in the garage. I want them piped into my coffin to listen to his sweet sweet voice for eternity. All the classics in one spot. You will impress the ladies with the knowledge of the classics, especially the older tarts at the bingo parlour. if you never buy but one CD in you life, make it Rod Stewart.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is fun but takes to long to get new life to play the game.  You always have to Facebook someone for new lives.  They should just let you play the game.  Fun and a bit challenging.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It is really refreshing to read a old time John Grisham story with a real plot, true to life characters and an ending that you were not sure of until the last few pages!  We'll done and welcome back Mr. Grisham of old!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It is just nice to click and get onto facebook on my Kindle.  It is not as easy as when I go onto Facebook for my PC or Laptop...I have yet to figure out how to use it on Kindle Fire.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|First of the good<br />- the thing is tiny.  Compared to roku, apple tv, etc, this thing is super small.<br />- it works.  It is very simple to operate and begin using<br />- its portable.  Unlike other products, when you are done with it you can simply unplug it from your tv and go.<br />- its power comes from usb.  This is perhaps the one of the best parts about this thing.  You do not have to plug this into the wall for it to work, but simply plug it into a usb port also on the back of most TV's.  the usb cable is included!<br />- PRICE!  I mean come on, seriously... you can turn your tv into a smart tv for under 40 dollars!<br /><br />The not so good<br />- There is only a very few apps that work with this so far: Youtube and Netflix.  (also it casts whatever is on your chrome browswer)<br /><br />Suggestions:<br />- It would be great if they could expand the apps to also work with MLB, NHL gamecenter, and slingbox to name a few.<br /><br />In the end, you can not beat the price of this device.  Even with the limited app support I would recommend this product.  Once more apps are supported, this thing will amazing.
B00622B3MY|4.0|My nephew is a Cars fanatic so I bought this to keep him occupied while I cooked dinner.  He was two at the time and was so engrossed with the movie that I had to tear him away to eat.  Even though the jokes were above his head, the quality of the pictures and the speed of the movie in its James Bond-feel captured his attention.  His little sister (1 yr old) loved it as well.  I was able to cook the whole meal without working about what they would get into.
8866137634|4.0|This notebook is really built nicely and has a wonderful feel to it.  The app that works with this notepad is where there could be some improvement. You basically snap a picture of each page of your notebook and it catalogs it in the cloud for you to access it on all of your wireless devices.  It also has some sort of OCR technology that converts your hand written notes to text for searcahbility. You can also assign &#34;tags&#34; to each note to aid in search later.
B005MMYT76|5.0|gordon-levitt,portman, wilson this cast was fantastic, it is awkward and wonderful. Hesher is a must watch. We all need a rebel to break in and disrupt our mundane lives.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Steelheart is a very inventive tale of courage, revenge, and corruption.  Information, misinformation and imaginative analysis allows normal people to fight extraordinary odds against an enemy most would simply bow before.  While I don't always agree that all of the choices of the heroes would be realistic in given situations, I always have to keep in mind that in real life people constantly make decisions I don't understand.  At some point the unlikely becomes the truth, and this book has a great way of illustrating how humans are constantly fighting against their nature.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|I have loved this movie from the first time I've watched it. It's by far my favorite Disney movie. My kids and watch it together all the time.
006202406X|1.0|After having read and loved the first 2 books I am very very disappointed in the final book.  What a shame!
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Does not give you any more information then androsensor app (which gives you more information on other components too like gps, magnetic sensor, proximity sensor, sound, etc.)<br /><br />Uninstall right away after installing it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Never saw that ending coming. Great finish to an intriguing series. Sad that it ended but it was worth the wait.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|The Percy Jackson series is a fun read. I enjoyed them and the movie. I'm waiting for new one to come out, I have it on order
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoyed reading A Crossfire Novel. I can't wait for Captivated By you! I almost pulled my hair out at the end of Entwined In You. I couldn't believe it ended like it did but it makes me excited about the next one (Captivated By You) :)
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have read most of the 007 books and enjoyed them. The movie is also enjoyable, but in a different way. I enjoy the special effects and watching the stars portray their characters.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I like most of the story line of the &#34;lawyering&#34; and investigating part....I am just no sure where the attraction between Will and Alyssa came from. It doesn't quite work for me.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Starts out like a really neat 1st person shooter game.  Then you get higher in the difficulty level and get stuck.  You can only get past the higher levels by buying extra stuff for your weapon, which, as near as I can tell, costs you a minimum of $4.95.<br /><br />So much for a &#34;free&#34; app.
1742204120|5.0|First, I'd like to say that you'll get your monies worth in this book! It's about 3 inches thick! Colored pages are present. All the typical offerings are there as well- maps, prices, festivals, lodging, eating, local tourist attractions, spas, yogas, traveling with children, booking trains, need to know, if you like, Top 17, Regions, etc.<br /><br />One thing i'd like to point out that's in this book i've never seen before are the notes on how to VOLUNTEER while in the area. What's the best way to immerse yourself in a culture than to serve it's people. I love the idea to take part in serving the least and there's many opportunities to do so.<br /><br />I don't own any other India travel books to compare this too. But from going through this book i'm impressed with it's offerings. I'd say between it's contents and the internet for further research a traveler would be good to go!
B006OB3K56|5.0|This film offers a very realistic picture of sexual addiction.  However it is also a tragic film as we see a very dysfunctional brother and sister as they each suffer in very different ways with a mysterious past, a barren present, and a hopeless future. Michael Fassbender repeatedly demonstrates that he is a superb actor, probably the best currently in films. Carey Mulligan offers a performance that is awesome as she portrays a very damaged young woman, trying to connect, driven by helpless dependency. Fassbinder plays a young New York businessman who deals with anxiety and emergence of painful thoughts or memories by changing his consciousness through sexual arousal and orgasm. Sexual arousal will temporarily divert him from disturbed thoughts or painful memories and his sexual behaviors have now become a standard escape from his thoughts. He shares a dark history with his younger sister, Sissy, and whereas they may be all each other has in the world, they evoke compulsions and negative emotions that makes this brother and sister relationship very dysfunctional. Mulligan's performance is tops.<br /><br />Director Steve McQueen has created a winner. The actors are flawless. The soundtrack uses a mixture of classical and pop that makes the film contemporary and yet contemplative.  The portion of the soundtrack written specifically for the film is excellent and evokes the tragic presence of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings. Like Barber's Adagio, the soundtrack conveys a sense of deterministic tragedy.<br /><br />In understanding sexual addiction, it is important to realize that the compulsive rituals of searching for sex, having sex, and having orgasm that help the compulsive escape the unpleasant memories or thoughts.  This film demonstrates that better than anything I have seen regarding compulsive and addictive behavior.<br /><br />This is also an intelligent film, never filling in the gaps but allowing the audience just enough information to make sense of the characters and the action. If you like films where all the parts come together, where all mysteries are explained, where there are no gaps left to the imagination, then this is not the film for you.<br /><br />Whatever happened to Brandon in his youth, he seems unable to form meaningful relationships and he undermines relationships that inch toward real intimacy. His sister seeks intimacy with him but she uses sexuality to gain intimacy which is exactly what he does not need in a familial relationship. They are locked in a dangerous dysfunctional relationship which Brandon dreads and avoids if possible. The film has considerable sexual content, in fact the most sexual content I have seen in a film in a very long time. However it was absolutely essential to the film since it shows Brandon sexually acting out to avoid his own thoughts and feelings. Fassbender does an outstanding job in a difficult role. I recommend it for adults.
B0058DRTGC|5.0|Good to Great and the Social Sectors is an insightful and practical look into the social sercice world with the respect of how to successfully structure and run the business side of the orgaization.  It is a must-read for all organization stewards and leaders to assure they fully understand and embrace a working model from the 30,000 foot level.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My friends daughter loves it and it keeps her entertained.  She has to pay attention and move quickly in order to progress.
B0083Z614S|5.0|one of the great feel good books of all times.  I love it because it doesn't have a lot of deceptive drama by the other heir/doctor  who is hoping to inherit.  I was fearful as I read it, that he would do something dreadful, but relaxed when he doesn't.  It is suitable for children or adults.  A great book to read and re-read.  I also have audio book of this, and have seen the movie. (and play)
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Hadn't seen it for 20 years and loved every minute of it.  Tom Hanks is amazing!  Our time was well spent watching and enjoying it.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|great book of all times.  I enjoyed this best in its audio book version, as it is very long, but the words are the same, so enjoy either way.  A classic that all women should read.
B00FWLSLJ4|2.0|This movie is so fake.  Most of the fighting scenes seem to be done at night.  The monsters are so fake and remind me of the ones in the Godzilla movies.  These monsters are supposedly coming out of the oceans so people are building walls around those states near the oceans...seriously!!!  This is definitely not anything like the &#34;Transformers&#34; movies.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Mark Russinovitch knocks this one out of the park. His talents as an actual software engineer allows the reader to get a look from the inside perspective of cyber-terrorism, and how it is combated. I can't wait to start reading &#34;Trojan Horse&#34;, the next in this series of books.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|Mostly Got This For The Faster Harder Song. But I Love The Whole Album. It's Great Music To Work Out To.
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|Let's face it, nothing beats the classic Kurt Russell flick, but this was darn good if you like movies like &#34;The Thing&#34;. It stuck to the plot and ending up tying into the original movie which was unexpected. It's one of those movies I can watch every couple of months when I want my monster movie fix, same with the original.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you love bejeweled you will love this. Power ups along the way keep things interesting. Lots of levels to play to keep you playing for hours.<br />Love it!!!
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|This was not the best of the series.  The story wasn't interesting and funny moments were few and far between. There were opportunities for it be better -- it just didn't happen.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I liked this season although there was a lot of sadness. There are several characters I will miss next season.
B0038QMREA|5.0|It's become a standard that I listen to regularly while driving. Totally unique, reminds me of stuff I listened to years ago. Prepare to be...amused? Surprised? Amazed? Listen to a sample first, but it's worth the chance if you like folksy, independent, simple, unusual stuff.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love this show! I watched all 3 seasons in a month. I can't wait for the next season to start!
B005HEPN06|3.0|Most of this series just made me slightly uncomfortable. Yeah, it's Star Trek: trite, silly, campy. Some very obvious moralizing regarding drugs, etc. Don't think I can take any more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Saving a great time with this game.  Just as addictive as I was warned! Maybe someday I'll get good enough that I won't use up my lives so quickly and have to take so many breaks lol!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I love the effects of this movie. The 3 D is just amazing..love the story line..waiting to see more of the John Carter series
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read so many of Mr. Grisham's novels that I wouldn't know where to place this one. A very easy read that will keep you turning the pages. Many twists and turns that are typical of the masters books. Enjoy!
B005EHQGTS|2.0|Gesture control difficult to use and very laggy, you cant pull out the side menus, plus you can never get rid of the cursor (which tries to follow gestures) gestures need as major rework plain and simple.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I do like this game quite a bit,  but don 't like to pay for lives.  Levels are getting harder now. I'm stuck at 23.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|An artsy display of the book--the handheld camera work makes you feel like you're really there. Stayed very true to the book, for which I was grateful.<br /><br />I first saw it in theaters after just finishing the book for the second time--I thought it was great, but I was anticipating everything that was coming up. When I watched this version, it had been more than a year since I'd read the books, and I was still amazed at 1) how good it was, and 2) how well you could catch on if you didn't really know what the book was about (ie if you hadn't read it).
B000I0XLYO|3.0|Zoolander is funny at times, painful at others as it spoofs and parodies the world of fashion modeling with a male-oriented twist.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Just learning how to play, I enjoy playing, glad that you get locked out because of no lives or I would want to play the game all day
B000RLFJQ2|4.0|I enjoyed this flick. Some nice plot twists and action scenes. Plus how could you go wrong with De Niro in this flick? I do not give 5 star reviews because no movie is perfect.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Two days in and already I am fully addicted!! Lol One of the best games for adults and older kids alike!!
B00EDX76PW|4.0|I know that they can't put the whole book into the movie, but I really wish they could. As far as movies go it was good and the plot was goo. The problem was that I read the book before seeing the movie.  My friends who have not read the book loved the movie, but I was missing some of the elements that I thought were important from the book. Overall a good film, but don't get your hopes too high.
B00821OX98|4.0|great series, interesting characters. I felt like Pope and Mason should have been more of a team, that dynamic would have been more interesting than the simple mutual hate thing.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Not only was I lucky enough to get this for the free app of the day, but it was a GREAT free app.Being a ultimate science fan, I love games like this.
B00EIBO8UK|5.0|I adore this movie & have since the first time I saw it, about 5 years ago. It has an amazing cast, who all have distinct acting style which are shown to their full ability & potential in this film.<br />I know that a great deal of people complain that this film jumps around, and the plot is obviously too thing because of that... But, that certainly isn't the case! There are so many stories within stories, and it's actually rather fun making the connections of how characters are related to one another. Also, this film does contain a great deal of British humor (can't imagine why since it's a BRITISH film)... And while many may not completely understand it, if you do happen to like British humor than you will love this film!<br /><br />I was thrilled to get the 10th anniversary edition! I wish they had told you it was in a very odd box instead of just a fancy slip cover... The box does make it slightly difficult to get the movie in & out, but oh well... Oh, and if you are ordering this from amazon you might want to be careful... The box is easily crushed unless well packed.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|wanted this movie for a long time.  great price.  arrived sooner than i expected.  haven't watched it yet.  can't say at this time what the quality of the movie is at this time.  will give update when i watch movie if i'm allowed to.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The book was amazing I loved it quantum the how could you do that veronica you could have ended the series good but you ended with just pain :.(
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Anything that will help me wake up and get out of bed is an A+ in my book. This app is a Godsend!!
6305428352|5.0|I seen this movie years ago and thought it would be a perfect gift for my son who know is a high school band director. This item arrived in good condition and before expected.
B008602KQI|4.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? This is a solid, good, dystopian story. Fast-paced with good character & plot development.  I felt comfortable with stopping after this book & not going through books 2 & 3 because of their own reviews. That could be because this isn't a genre I usually read, though there are many who do, and love the entire trilogy.  I am glad to have read this.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Who ever thought just  of just having  five lives and after losing those you have to purchase more or wait 30 minutes each for the  New lives. If you are doing the math that is two hours and a half. Some folks don't have 90 cents to pay. To pay  for a.thing extra.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Got me hook, line & sinker. Just a suggestion but stay away from the hints. Just work it out. Gripping
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE THE GAME, LIKE HOW THERE IS A DIFFERENT SCREEN EVERYTIME<br />LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am a kid, but my review matters just a much as anyones. I am 10 years old, and love reading. My mom got me divergent, and i loved it. then completed insurgent, and waited for this one. i bought it, and before bed, read about one third of it. then another third the next day. when tris died, i was surprised, because i have never seen that before, and i totally got it. tris's mom died, her dad, uriah, and many abegnation she probably knew. she simply followed them. not that death is a good thing, but still. i also liked it because ive thought, why do all stories have happy endings, when real life doesn't? this went against that and i love it.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|Easy, no brainer, just fun to play.  Fills the time when you are waiting<br />in doctors office.  No internet required to play
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Rainbow Rowell has a spectacular ability to create compelling characters who are in parts lovely, honest, and incredibly frustrating.  I devoured this book in an afternoon and was left with a profound desire for more---there's so much more to Eleanor and Park that I wish to understand; facets of their personalities and nuances unique to them left to discover.  If you liked Eleanor & Park, I recommend Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Haven't figured it all out yet, but it does show battery level and time avail<br />for other uses, like music and video
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. The 3D blu ray is a must on my Christmas list. I could watch this movie over and over.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|although the actual story's premise wasn't very believable, the movie makers did a good job of pulling it off, and Jennifer Lawrence was stellar.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I liked it very much. This novel is not about little astronaut boy or new Jedi) Its more psychological I think
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|This is my fourth book from Kelby, the others were instruction in different generations of Photoshop.  His pragmatic advice and sorting through of way-to-many-features as a photography pro are invaluable, the tedium of instruction is always moved along by his corny humor and blunt editorial comments.  HIs web site has appropriate photos for download should you not have enough for practice.  An invaluable photographer's resource.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Not what I had expected but in a good way. Plenty of twists and turns will hold your attention. Never a dull moment!
B000N6TYLW|4.0|I bought all seasons and have loaned it out to several friends, including men.  Everyone has become completely entranced with the series.  Very clever and FAST dialogue.  Characters are just that: characters!  Very funny.  Note Melissa McCarthy's supporting role in her slimmer days.  The Gilmore Girls are grandmother Emily, single mom Lorelei, and her teen daughter, Rory.  They all have men rotating in and out of their lives.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was such a fun romance to read, a little back and forth; but, they were a good match!  I loved the good ending too.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A well written story that I couldn't put down and will remember for a long time. I recommend this book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I hadn't read any reviews of the book and started without expectations, except that I've never been disappointed by King.  Excellent book!  Interestingly he also addressed the broader issue of alchoholism.  I recommend this highly!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I was super excited to see my pre-ordered copy arrive yesterday, and thought that I'd bring it with me today while running errands and sitting in doctors' office waiting rooms. Big mistake. I was laughing to the point that my body was shaking and tears were running down my face and I'm pretty sure I snort-laughed a few times. I had to explain to the eye doctor that - no, nothing was actually wrong with my eyes, and it was this book, and it was making me cry, but because it was funny. Also, people in the waiting room were freaked out by this crazy woman convulsing and snorting in the corner.<br /><br />One other comment, though - while this book was funny and insightful, I feel like she was being really unfair to herself in spots, like the Identity parts at the end (and I'm sure this is from the depression she's been suffering).
B003DDKAT2|4.0|the star power in this movie is outstanding, well performed and written.  the part that I enjoyed the most was the narrative.  By narrative I mean the thoughts in the lead character, Louis.  A powerhouse of a movie, and it holds up very well since its release in the 90's.  not many do (think technology as in the old bricks that were cell phones, etc. )
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love this show and enjoy watching it with my wife.  The situations and cases are all a little strange and different but that's what makes it good.  It's not as good as the BBC show &#34;Luther&#34; but you can't be everything to everyone.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved it! Great read- couldn't put it down!! It was a great escape from my day. I would recommend this to others.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|We watched all three of these new Batman movies over a couple of evenings and enjoy them all.  Christian Bale is a bit of a whiner but he does a decent job as Batman.  Some cool gadgets and machines too.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Not going to review the movie because you can find those elsewhere; this is about the product. Everything came as described. No complaints!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Wife loves it.  She has been watching it for a while and enjoys the witty banter.  I think it's okay and tend to cruise the web on the iPad while she watches but that works for us.
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|Who could complain! Watching this with your child is like a time machine tool you back to the time when you first went to a movie theater
B007FG9LIE|3.0|It's just OK....not a book I would recommend.  It is better than the first however.  All you are doing is waiting for the author to tell yiu what had already happened.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|It was entertaining. What if the red shirts knew they were red shirts?  Not quite as deep as one might imagine but still fun.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I loved the first book but the second is even better. The pacing is faster, and I found myself turning pages to find out what happens next!
B00BT70IWS|5.0|I this album, Kaufman sings the great arias of many of Verdi's greatest leading men, many of whom he has not sung on the stage.  Yet.  After hearing the effortless power and poise of his voice here, you will be longing to see him in these roles.  I particularly enjoyed his moving rendition of Othello's farewell to Desdemona...and life.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I bought this so I could mount my phone to my mountain bike.  As with all RAM products, it's perfect.
B00G32VYDG|1.0|This MIB clone failed to produce. Plot was too predictable, little humor,  recommend passing on this one as it was a disappointment.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Heard so much about the game and being one of the few people not playing thought I would!!!  Now I know what it's all about!!  It's fun to figure out the puzzles!!!  Glad I gave it a try!
0316010669|4.0|So much of what we think is based on &#34;thoughtful analysis&#34; really happens in the blink of an eye. The subconscious is indeed very powerful. The section on the failed &#34;war game&#34; that led up to the War on Iraq (my name for it) is chilling.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|You cannot deny that the price of this knife leaves some skeptical.  But its a pretty decent knife overall.  I like the size and weight.  The blade can get a pretty good edge on it but with just a little hacking you can dull it out somewhat quickly.  I would say that there aren't many knives better at this price point.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Awesome. Great streaming service in a nut shell. No interruption what so ever !!! Best decision on watching these :)
B009RX8AQW|5.0|Came before the delivery date, which I love, who doesnt!? Love all the twists to stories we have all heard, it gives it a new spin.  And you cant help loving all the characters, even the &#34;villain's&#34;.

B0058YPLA2|5.0|Absolutely love this series!!! It came before the delivery date which is always a pleasant surprise. I love all the characters and storyline it keeps me coming back for more.
B002KEDQJQ|4.0|For some reason, I wasn't that impressed when I saw it in the theaters when it was first released, but I have to admit that this version, with some added footage (although I couldn't tell what was added) worked much better for me. A truly epic story (which does fix Alan Moore's kind of goofy ending), some good performances (particularly Jackie Earle Haley, despite his mask), and some excellent twists. Not so much great big surprises that change everything -- more of a really involved, involving story with a lot of back history to fill it out. In this recent avalanche of comic-book based movies, I would recommend checking this one out again, even if you didn't like it the first time. And if you haven't seen it -- put it on your &#34;must view&#34; list.

B00881VLCE|5.0|Fun to play with many puzzles to choose from. You can make each puzzle as easy or difficult as you wish by choosing the amount of pieces you want the puzzle divided into.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|It is one of the best hidden objects I have played.  The games in between the hidden object games are excellent as well
B00F56AZK4|1.0|Can hardly play the puzzles without the game asking you to upgrade. Finally had decided to remove the game from my Kindle Fire HD
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun game but waiting for energy stinks! You can only play maybe 5 to 10 minutes at a time untilnyou have to wait hours for your energy to refill.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|Until the last 15 minutes of the 3rd episode, the 4th season seems to have lost its dramatic intensity. The show seems overly violent and redundant now.
0446615641|5.0|I've been kind of riding the fence on the Camel Club series. I've read most of them, out of order and this was next to the last, but the one I most wanted to read because it has a lot of loose ends in it. I still haven't read the first one yet, Camel Club but that early one will probably find the author gathering his focus with this gang.<br /><br />In this story, several issues are resolved and the cliff hanger I already read in the final story. I wasn't sure I'd like it knowing the spoilers, but instead, I found it probably the most enjoyable of the lot. The action was fast-paced, never bogging down with endless exposition. The point of view was solid third-person with minimal head-hopping and I found the editing excellent.<br /><br />There were probably a few places where the plot could be considered clich&eacute;d like with the kid scene near the end, but otherwise, nothing really jarred me or upset my suspense of disbelief. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It kept me glued to my seat and that's all I can ask for. I'll definitely remember it over the rest of the series.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great ending to an enjoyable trilogy. Twists and turns and an unpredictable story.  Can't wait for the movies to follow.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|I just didn't like it. It wasn't funny, special effects are sloppy and I would rather just watch MIB again. It had potential but fell flat.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Thought it tied a lot of the old story in with this new one.  But I wish the<br />ending had a little more to it.  Felt it wrapped things up to neatly.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Finding Pride. I stayed interested through the entire book. At times I had a difficult time putting the book down.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Excellent book! I love the way the author develops the relationships in this sometimes very sad story that ends up a triumphant one!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Simply loved it! I could relate with Cheryl on so many levels. This is a book I would read a second time.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Well built, very sturdy<br />Strong plastic, initially has odor but with rinsing and airing out has gone away.  Love it
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|This movie seems to combine so many parallels to so many other movies that maybe that is why I chose to only rate it OK.  If a science fiction movie can do that but clearly stand on its own based on the story line then that usually makes it exceptional in my book, but in this case it seems to somewhat deride it from getting to that point.  This seems to be a collage of Orwell's 1984, the Matrix, and a few other movies I can think of, but while the concepts of those movies may fit this one, they just also seem to be missing those key elements that make if unique and fun.  Not as fluid I guess is what I am trying to say.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book because there was always something new around the corner waiting for you to see.  Would love to have a second book about this story.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|I thought this movie did a great job as a prequel to the old classic Wizard of Oz, and yet stands on its own as a movie that delivers a pleasant and fun viewing experience.  It is one that could be watched again.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This app is the best fighting apps there is<br />I love there's lots of robots to chose from its great
B003U6BE8I|4.0|This is a typical fun Percy Jackson action adventure movie.  I let movies like this get ranked more by how my grandkids like it more so than myself, and they like all the Percy Jackson movies.  It keeps the kids entertained and usually holds the attention of adults as well.

0380715430|4.0|Entertaining pile of trivia about the English language (as well as many other languages). For example, &#34;the military vehicle the tank got its name because during its secretive experimental phase people were encouraged to think it was a storage receptacle.&#34;<br /><br />I'd had no idea how arbitrary the creation of our language was, and found myself quite stunned at times. Loved the idea that all languages might well be derivations of one original shared language.<br /><br />I found it interesting that in writing a book (published in 1990) that documents the haphazard progress of the English language, Bill Bryson himself seems unconsciously to illustrate a shift in usage by moving randomly from his preferred 'male as default' bias (most examples use 'he') to an occasional 'he or she' and a rare singular pronoun 'they.'<br /><br />Natasha Holme<br />Author of 'Lesbian Crushes and Bulimia: A Diary on How I Acquired my Eating Disorder'
B008Y1RTUG|2.0|This was neither a good movie nor a bad movie.  It was ok and I did expect it to be worse than it was.  The story was passable for the kind of movie it was.  The major handicap that this movie suffered from was Kristen Stewart's acting.  Her character somehow displayed the exact same emotion throughout the entire movie and through many different situations.  Her acting range goes from saying her lines with a mild look of disgust all the way to saying her lines with a mild look of disgust.
B004JMY312|5.0|I have been watching this movie every year practically since it came out. It isn't scary, but has twists and turns to keep you in your seat. A classic halloween flick.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very cute and fun game, my daughter loves this game. It's very entertaining. I even play it. I give this 5 stars :)
B00CRMX53S|5.0|If you like an upbeat song with a little disco feel this is for you. The rest of the album is p pretty good too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is a game that keeps you on your toes.  Makes you keep on thinking actively.  Fun and frustrating.
B005EPKS8A|5.0|They may have been a made up band but man did they rock. What came from the geniuses of Akroyd and Belushi was pure magic.
B000FC1192|5.0|Absolutely delightful book... I laughed and loved the deliciously scary parts and especially loved the spunky little girl who conquers fear and beats the demonic villainous witchy other mother!
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|Free download is nothing more then a notepad with no features.  If oyu wnat features you have to spend money.  To many other Apps out there free making this a very bad wordpad.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Keep your memory sharp with this game.There no better mental stimulous that one of games like this.Will recommend to friends and family.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|At nine months pregnant, I wanted an easy, engaging read to take my mind of things, and this book delivered on that front. I found it was a definite page turner, but also very predictable (the secret is so obvious, long before it's revealed) and well as kind of trite in the epilogue. It's mindless, but a fun, quick read.<br /><br />I was almost driven nuts about the references to hot cross buns (Is this something everyone in Australia eats like crazy? Every character was eating them--18 references no less!) and even more references to the Berlin Wall (an attempt at a metaphor perhaps that just fell flat and got annoying).<br /><br />All things considered, I enjoyed it as much as I expected and it certainly fulfilled its intended purpose.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|Metronome let me make the music as fast or as slow as a like it.Also another use,relax and meditate with the slow note.Love it.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|This is my all time favorite television show! I have always purchased the DVD sets around Christmas time when they were on sale. But I must say, this was a far better price than I paid at any store in town! Great price, fast shipping.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Reading this book is like having a conversation with Ellen herself, I would imagine. It's a little all over the place, but it's always fun. Makes me want to be friends with her! :)
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|My family enjoyed this unique film tremendously and have watcched it a number of times with each viewing being more and more impressive.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I paid $3.99 for this. UNBELIEVABLE. Adam Levigne under $5? How could I ever complain? Lots of great tracks on this one.
B008Y212PI|4.0|An amazing game. Only wish it had a time challenge. The puzzles are well designed.  I will buy more games from this developer.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts and one for my own daughter. Looks great and still as fun as it was when I was a kid! Some of the best Disney songs ever in this film.
141694737X|1.0|I received this book as a gift, and my infant son doesn't give it the time of day. He's only 5 months old, but it's not his age - we have several other Karen Katz flip books and he lights up and laughs when I bring them out. This book has 2 main things going against it: the pages are white (boring!) and for some reason, the flip ups, (and consequently the animals underneath), are only a fraction of the size of the pages which makes no sense to me as there is tons of wasted space on the page! The flip ups need to be bigger and colors more exciting. Two thumbs down for us.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|Buy the entire album with this one. There's maybe two songs I occassionally skip through. No wonder Taylor has the success she does; GREAT songwriting!
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Just Love This Movie!! Mike and Sully are Very Funny and it teaches the kids about teamwork and friendship Must see!!
0307352145|3.0|Author is kind of annoying. She writes:<br /><br />\\"'It's not enough,' one senior manager ... told the author ... 'to be able to sit at your computer excited about a fantastic regression analysis if you're squeamish about presenting those results to an executive group.' (Apparently it's OK to be squeamish about doing regression analysis if you're excited about giving speeches.)\\"<br /><br />How does the quote from the manager imply that? I take that quote to mean that the manager needs you not to be squeamish about both the regression analysis and giving the speech. Cain's \\"Apparently it's OK...\\" quip seems excessively malicious to me. Maybe she should take her own advice: Quiet.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent! Could put it down. Great intertwined story line with vivid characters that are everyday people! Loved it from cover to cover!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was unbelievable!  However, make sure you have a box of tissues next to you, because it is a guaranteed tear jerker.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game, my only problem is having to buy stuff to play<br />very addictive but fun to play
B00466HN6S|5.0|This movie was great. I like to have holiday videos for each season and this is one of out favorite Easter ones. It was funny and the kids loved it!
B002EX7GBC|4.0|This is a great movie for the family.<br />I think every kid should see this great story book tale.<br />A must see!!!!
B00EY8AL1M|5.0|Need I say more? This is Star Trek The Next Generation. Mere words cannot express how awesome this show is.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app. It works great on the kindle! I love the options !! The music option works the best for more!
B00540G3G6|3.0|The phrase &#34;jumps right off the screen&#34; was written by someone who had not really looked at this DVD as the quality of 3D is one of the poorest I have yet seen, Ishould have  stuck with my original dvd as this one is hit and miss at best. Conversions can be v good....see Jurassic Park or Titanic...not this NBC though. Give The Croods a look as it has the best 3D I have seen in animated film....Loved &#34;UP&#34; although more fot adults than kids,as human mortality is a major theme in it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Loads of fun. You won't want to stop playing. Great Match 3 game.  Best part its free. I personally think its the best app you can get.

B0002OOUP0|5.0|I love the rolling stones.  This CD is on while I drive.  It makes a traffic jam a much better event.  Superb rock and roll.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I purchased one at the very first moment announced. It was better than the secound one that i bought. I would give this product 5 stars if they improve the sound and the pic clear. However, it is amaizing idea to connect TV to the interent.
B00742GBDM|2.0|Disclaimer - I only got about half an hour into this before I couldn't watch it anymore.  The Fanny in this movie is absolutely nothing like the Fanny in the book.  Fanny was supposed to be small, quiet, skittish around even her family circle, and very modest.  The Fanny in this movie was outspoken, rowdy, and apparently political.  It was just all wrong. The whole \\"moral\\" of the story is the superiority of a person of character over all the other charms a person can have.  This showed Fanny to be lacking in that quality.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|It continues to surprise you in each episode. It centers around inventions that one would like to see developed in our lifetime.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Such a timeless classic, this movie does not get old! Perfect family fun for Halloween time! The shrunken heads in the afterlifeve waitin room is hands down my favorite scene!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Although the story is not perfect, it was a fun movie to watch. Very entertaining, fast-paced, action packed movie. HD a must.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This author did a great job of putting history into a novel thus it always helps me absorb it.  The relationship between the Orphan train woman (now in her 90's) and a young woman that appeared to be going down the wrong path made quite a turn around in the young woman.
B000VNMMPM|4.0|A black and white look at stylized Paris, by way of It's a Wonderful Life, with a wise, amazon sex goddess as the tour guide. The film fills the frame with dazzling imagery, the captivating star Rie Rasmussen alone handles much of that. But this is the Paris is cooler, cleaner, and more magical than the real thing. This film stands out from Besson's other work, in look, tone, and story. The simple, nuanced story seems to stall a bit here and there, or maybe it just meditates on itself. But it picks back up soon enough and propels toward the journey of finding out who you really are.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of this game. I am actually a gamer, meaning I get paid. I like Minecraft for the PC the most, Xbox 360 Edition, and Pocket Edition least. It isn't updated as much and harder to control. Especially on a phone or iPod. iPads and tablets are fine, but I'm sure it will be better with more updates.
1932907009|4.0|In a sea of how-to-write books, this one is written buy a guy with some credentials. The lamentably not with us anymore, Blake Snyder broke down story-telling, be it stuff you already knew, or new concepts, in a very common-sense way. He codifies, and demystifies the process and renders it accessible to beginning scribes and seasoned veterans alike.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Just as addictive as the online version. Have been spending a lot of time with it . Easy to pick up and easy to set down.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Every great episode, and fun extras and commentaries on every episode...every one! Not to mention, great shorts, and bloopers on every disc. Hard to pass up for any fan!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I don't know what all the hoopla has been about this game. I keep trying it to see if it gets better, but I find that I am probably just wasting time. I have Crush Candy which I enjoy much more than this one. Crush Candy is a lot more simplistic than this game, but I am only working against myself and trying to better my score. This one says 'clear all the jellies' and it is frustrating to find them scatter to where you can not get them together to clear them and you end up running out of time or lives. Not recommended.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|If you're into extras, man does this disc have you covered! The singing commentary track is worth the price of admission alone. The regular commentary is pretty cool too. A great story, born out of the writers's strike as only Joss and company can give.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Hello, I am Matheus and I am a fifth grader at EAC, Escola Americana de Campinas. My teacher, Mrs.K, read to our class WONDER. After we finished the book she made us do a project; we have to do a few projects<br />on the book. As a result here I am sitting in a chair, writing this review.<br /><br />I really liked the  book for three main reasons. First, I liked how R. J. Palacio interpreted August´s feeling like she was in Auggie´s shoes. Also, she used really good words for us to visualize what was happening in the book. Finally, she used  several points of view such as Vea’s, Jack Will’s, Miranda’s, Summer’s, and Justin’s.<br /><br />It was a great book to understand how people with problems feel inside, although they might not show it outside.
006202406X|1.0|I loved Divergent and Insurgent and was so looking forward to Allegiant. Then I read Allegiant.  The quality of writing took a nosedive into the monotony of barely elementary level. The effort was missing if there at all.  Half the time I was bored out of my mind the other half I was so tired of the rehash of the past.  Did Ms. Roth just get tired of the story line and decide to throw it all away?<br />  When a hero in a story dies it's usually a tear jerker. In this book it was a welcome escape! I wanted the other heroic characters to do suicide just to escape the dull plot line!  How two such intelligent hero's who kept a story moving could suddenly become the dumbest excuse for teenage angst ridden milk toast first love I will never understand!<br />  Even after reading some really bad books I can usually find some redeeming quality and see where the author was trying to say even if their skills are poor. Ms. Roth has the skill so there is no excuse for this debacle!<br />  I understand the movie is already in the works for the first book. I don't even think I'll bother with it now after reading this mess.<br /><br />  Ms. Roth, you should be ashamed of yourself!
1451666179|5.0|I was so excited when this arrived at my doorstep yesterday. I immediately hunkered down on the couch and began reading.I laughed, I cried, I leaked a little. Truly an awesome book that everyone should go out and buy.<br /><br />The book is a collection of some of Allie's best stories from her blog and some new stories (like getting lost in the woods as a kid and forced to collect pinecones). I was initially skeptical that converting from blog to book format would be awkward and confusing, but Allie has masterfully divided up the words and pictures to make it easy and engaging to read.<br /><br />I was extremely impressed by the quality of the book. For a book that was only $10 to come on glossy, colored paper like this blows my mind. I almost feel like I'm getting away with something bad, like I've cheated on the price or something.<br /><br />Overall, a great book to read and even better one to have. Buy it now!
B00821OX98|5.0|Very entertaining.  This is the alian version of walking dead.<br />Its nice to have a new SCI FI TV show to watch.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I have loved the series written by Mr. Lee but thought Tom Cruise was a poor choice for Reacher.  Someone taller and more withdrawn.  Cruise is too likeable.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had a hard time putting it down; very intelligent.  The author seems very insightful to the motivations/actions of each character.
B004FECNIO|4.0|Love this movie, made my mom cry when briefly describing the ending. Spielberg takes Disney's Pinocchio and gives it a great twist!!

1423101502|5.0|I really enjoyed reading “The Last Olympian” the last book in the well known “Percy Jackson” series by Rick Riordan. This final book in the series, was action packed since the first page of the book. I really loved reading this book and I would definitely recommend this book for other teenagers to read, mostly if your into Greek Mythology as much as I do. In the epic conclusion of the book series, Percy and his half-blood friends are going to war against Kronos and the brutal Titans. The Titans are trying to destroy Olympus (which in the book series is located on the top level of the Empire State Building) but Percy, the son of Poseidon will not let them destroy it. If you decide to read “The Last Olympian” I definitely recommend reading the other Percy Jackson books first, or at least have a familiarity with the story line or you may not have a clue what is going on. I really loved this book not just because I’m an action fan, but the way Riordan makes Percy so close to his best friends Grover and his lover Annabeth is really something special. Although throughout the entire series your wishing for more of a relationship between Percy and Annabeth the last book really didn’t disappoint. I would give this book 5 Stars out of 5, and this was one of my favorite book series I’ve read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really fun I really enjoy it.  I love how it makes you think and remember things. Thanks for making it
B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|Season 1, Murder House, was well done, especially for a television series, with a story that is very high on the &#34;creepy&#34; factor. The story lost its way a bit mid-season, but pulled together and wrapped-up nicely by the end. It lacks a strong how & why backstory that would have tied the whole season together even better, leaving me wondering why this house is the way it is. There is the suggestion that it became so because of the original owner (I'll withhold any spoilers), but it is not clear if that was the origin of the problems or merely the first instance.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the over sexualizing of much of the story, which is often quite graphic and frequently mixes sex and violence. I though the story could have appealed to a much larger and somewhat younger audience by softening the sex (including rape scenes, graphically portraying thrusting bodies, and murder during a sexual act). As it is, I would give it a strong R rating if it were a movie, and wouldn't allow a child younger than 16 or 17 to watch it. Overall, that aspect disappointed me as my younger teenagers would have enjoyed the story.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Just got this last night so I've only listened to the songs once but just like most of the Arcade Fire's music it sounds like a genre jumping, beautiful record. Each album the band takes a different direction which is so impressive in its own right but then they don't just experiment they make it sound like they have played this for years and make it their own. Love this band and so far this album, get it and support some amazing artists.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is a very great app. It works very well and i have had no problems with it. Ihave learned lots of songs on this and have now been able to play it on a real piano. This is a great app for all ages. I highly recommend this app.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|David Baldacci has never failed to make a book exciting and full of mystery.  I had a hard time putting this book down. I don't know how he thinks up all the intrigue, twists, and turns.  And, it's all so logical at the end.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|great cast, to bad it was cancelled way too soon, i think given just a little more time it  would have been even better than star trek
B0070Z4M4I|2.0|They took a perfectly good story and made it into mayhem and gore. We didn't even watch it all the way through.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it will not connect to the internet on my Kindle at my home.  I have to constantly sync my progress on somebody else's internet.  Otherwise, its a blast to play.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If you something simple to use this is it. No fuss no muss!  Does what I need for it to do.....calculate...plus it is easy to read takes full advantage of my Kindle 's full screen. What more could a girl ask for!

0307949486|4.0|***Review posted on Ini's Ravishing Reads!blog***<br /><br />SYNOPSIS :<br /><br />Harriet Vanger, a young scion of one of the wealthiest families in Sweden disappears forty years ago. Her uncle is determined that she was murdered and continues to seek the truth by hiring  Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading journalist  recently trapped by a libel conviction to investigate. He is aided by the pierced and tattooed punk prodigy Lisbeth Salander. Together they tap into a vein of iniquity and corruption.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS :<br /><br />This book caught my eyes when I was randomly browsing for mystery thriller books but I was little intimidated to read a chunky book with 600 pages or so. That was the initial thought and after reading the synopsis I was intrigued. This is the first book in the Millennium Trilogy. For some reason it took me a super long time to start the book. Intense mystery read with complex plot. First 100 pages describes the economy and business, it was  like watching a paint dry but after that it picks up and I was totally engrossed. Certain moments in the book are graphic not overly but the intensity is high up there (Watch out). There were lots of characters that I thought I would get confused but I didn't. Pretty addictive, you might want to go on with the series. I should say it was the most stunning and brilliant thriller I have ever read.
0062239422|5.0|***Review posted on Ini's Ravishing Reads! blog***<br /><br />Into the Darkest Corner was a gripping, creepy and engrossing read. This book was recommended to me by a good friend of mine and of course many of my Goodreads friends. Since then i had this book in my to-be-read shelf. I don't have a clear explanation for putting off this book to a later read. Eventually i had to pick it up after seeing my friends gushing about it. It has the most chilling plot line that i have read in a very long time. I'm not a squeamish person, but surprisingly this book creeped me out. Haynes writing was intense and unputdownable.<br /><br />The book flips back and forth between past and the present happenings. The protagonist Catherine Bailey(past) has been enjoying the single life as a coquette for long enough to know a good catch when she sees one. She meets charismatic Lee and starts dating. Her friends too clearly agrees he is gorgeous. Their relationship starts out to be amazing but later Catherine finds out Lee has a darker side. Her friends start suspecting her for their rocky relationship, this is because Lee is a charmer and begins to tell her friends that aren't true about Catherine. She is driven into the darkest corner of her world, and trusting no one. She makes  a scrupulous plan to escape her predicament.<br /><br />Four years later (present) Lee is  behind the bars and Catharine now Cathy(changes her name) is suffering from OCD and PTSD. She isolates herself  and starts checking things over and over. Every time she enters the house she ensures her apartment main door lock is safely secured, and checks the curtains,  bathroom doors, kitchen cabinets, room, her personal belongings. She has a count for checking. If she feels something is wrong she would start it again. Now Cathy doesn't trust anyone and always has a thought that Lee is watching her even though he is in prison. She meets Stuart, a psychologist who lives in the apartment above her and he convinces her to seek treatment for her OCD. Eventually they start liking each other but Cathy is wary in stepping into another relationship. After a while she finds out something strange at her place and realizes Lee is back.<br /><br />While reading this book I felt like I was developing OCD and I did check my door. I kid you not, even the slightest noise scared me and my heart pounded. I wanted to slow down to take things happening in the book and assure myself that its a fictional one but I couldn't resist any longer and I whipped through book quickly. Yes, it was that gripping and intense. I was cringing in shock when I read the last few lines. In my opinion it is a Riveting novel.<br /><br />I know what you're thinking now... Wondering what is Lee's darker side and how did Catherine  change to Cathy and what is Cathy's final move??? Well.. grab a copy of this book and find out for yourself!!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to  anyone who wants to get sucked in a good thriller and  get creeped out. If by any chance you are going to read it before you hit the sack be ready to face your nightmares.seek treatment for her OCD.

030758836X|4.0|***Review posted on Ini's Ravishing Reads! blog***<br /><br />SYNOPSIS :<br /><br />Marriage can be a real killer. It is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented Mansion on the Mississippi River. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents, the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter. But is he really a killer?<br /><br />MY  THOUGHTS :<br /><br />This book had lots of buzz around the world and I wanted to check out what all the hype was about. Unexpected surprises wrapped up in a black book. Flynn's writing style is amazing. It was like watching a Hitchcock movie in which suspense builds up slowly. With razor sharp writing and her ability to build suspense till the very end of the book was astounding. Fast paced book which keeps you at the edge of the seat guessing till the end. It is said in multiple points of view and the wife's perspective as diary format was brilliant. Tense and twisted plot line. It has more dark and sudden curves than a roller coaster ride. I was not even 10 pages into the book but i found myself hooked. Now I am going to stop gushing about this book and the author and  I am going to check out other books of Gillian Flynn right away.
0307341550|5.0|***Review posted on Ini's Ravishing Reads! blog***<br /><br />After reading Gone Girl, instantly I became a fan of Gillian Flynn. My expectation for this book was high and i wasn't disappointed. Flynn's writing style is very dark. As you know I'm a sucker for Thrillers, and purchased this book immediately after finishing Gone Girl. I stayed up all night to finish this book and yes that is how the story was, it kept sucking me in.The first thing that comes to mind about this book is twisted, dark, disturbing. When you pick up this book ensure that you don't have pending works because you might tend to procrastinate your works once you start reading.<br /><br />Camille Preaker, a newspaper reporter is sent to her hometown to get the inside scoop on the murders of  two preteen girls, both strangled and had their teeth removed (Doesn't it sound weird about removing teeth? -yes it is, i had the same thought). She is reluctant to visit her hometown as she has a troubled past associated with it. Camille meets her neurotic mother, her half-sister and her step father in a Victorian mansion after eight long years. Everything starts from here. Clues keep leading to dead ends, forcing Camille to unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past to get at the story. Camille will have to confront what happened to her years before if she wants to survive this homecoming.<br /><br />Camille Preaker is a weird female with both strong and fragile nature. You will get to know that she is from a twisted family as you progress with the story. There is something unhealthy about this book- characters, relation between mother and daughter. This book is truly dark and creepy and has special stuff towards the end. I thought I figured out something half way through the story but Flynn made the ending a jaw dropping one. I was cringing in shock when i read the epilogue. Too much was packed towards the end but absolutely brilliant debut of Flynn. I don't want to giveaway a lot of details but all i can say is it's an amazing psychological thriller. I wouldn't recommend this book to squeamish, but if you have slightest inclination towards thriller, give it a shot.i can say is it's an amazing psychological thriller.

B005DI9HPI|4.0|*** Review posted on Ini's Ravishing Reads! blog***<br /><br />I got  I Heart New York by Lindsey Kelk on a whim during a plane ride to San Francisco. Once a while I do love to read chick lit to ease my stress. Many readers suggested that if you like Sophie Kinsella, you'll enjoy Lindsey Kelk. Honestly I haven't read a single Sophie Kinsella's novels *confession time*. I started I Heart New York without any high expectation and surprisingly I loved it. A perfect book for a relaxing plane ride exploring the Big Apple. I didn't know it was a series when I got the book and glad I read the first one and craving more of the I heart series.<br /><br />I Heart New York, is a chick-lit about Angela Clark, (the protagonist) who finds her boyfriend cheating on her at her best friend's wedding. She decides to take a hiatus by taking off to the wonderful New York city. Being a total stranger to the Big Apple, she takes a taxi and arrives at a hotel. Jenny Lopez, a friendly concierge recognizes her breakup and tries to cheer her up by transforming into an absolute New Yorker.<br /><br />Jenny takes Angela for a New York City makeover, shopping and all the girly stuff and from there Angela is a new person, certainly ready to socialize. Within a week of her arrival she starts dating two men. With Jenny's help, Angela gets a blogging job for a popular magazine. Things seem to be perfect on the outside but on the inside, Angela deals with a whirlwind of emotions. She is uncertain of heading home to England.<br /><br />Angela dates another two completely different men-Tyler, the businessman and Alex, the rocker. It was interesting to see Angela experience New York city for the first time. I should say, I found myself taking Tyler's side initially and as the story progresses, Alex seemed to takeover. After what happened to Angela back at home, she is now ready for little fun.<br /><br />I Heart New York is a total fun read. One of the things which surprised me was Angela's blog. She keeps writing about dating two men without mentioning either of their names and the blog becomes a big hit overnight,eventually both of the men figures out about who she writes. I expected a blow-up which certainly did not happen. I found this a little unrealistic and that was the only issue I had with this book. Despite the minor unrealistic part, I loved this book.<br /><br />If you would like a fun and relaxing book and also want a dazzling introduction to New York City, then join the club with Angela and have fun. One of my favorite scene would be the sunset from Empire State Building, it was like dream come true. All in all, I Heart New York is a guilty pleasure book. For all those who would like to visit the Big Apple, I Heart New York would quench your thirst.eeps writing about dating two men without mentioning either of their names and the blog becomes a big hit overnight,eventually both of the men figures out about who she writes.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|Allegiant is the 3rd and final book for Veronica Roth's Divergent series.  I loved the first two books of this series.  They were great; wonderful exciting stories, and some awesome characters, especially Tris and Tobias.  I could not wait for this final book, and to see how Roth was going to end it all.  I discussed this with a few friends, who read this series based on my recommendation.<br /><br />Allegiant to me was a major disappointment.  It just wasn't the same, with the book being very slow early on, as well as the constant redundancy.  I also did not like the POV's that Roth decided to add into this book, which made it so different then the first.  It was almost like a different writer.<br /><br />What drew me to this series were the young protagonists we met, as well as the exciting action throughout.  All of this was missing for the most part.  As much as I loved Tobias, the main character for this series, the one who we followed through it all, was Tris.  She was a fantastic character, strong, smart, tough, and would make a fearless leader. In fact, in this book, I thought Tobias was no where near as strong as Tris.  The best part of the book, despite its climatic ending, was the epilogue.  Roth wrote this well....a nice tribute.<br /><br />SPOILERS ......SPOILERS.....SPOILERS<br />(Do not go past this point if you have not read this book, unless you want to spoiled)<br /><br />I have been a big fan of this series, and loved VR's writing.  But after reading Allegiant, and this is solely my opinion....I was sadly disappointed, as I did not feel this was the same author who wowed us in the first two books.<br /><br />We became invested into these characters.  We loved Tris and Tobias.  We get it...it's a war. People have to die.  It's reality.  But this is fiction; we read and imagine with you the excitement of the battles, the love, the friendships.......the ending game.<br /><br />I totally understand that sacrifices have to be made in a story like this.  VR did make them all throughout.  But to take a main character, and sacrifice that character is not what we invested in.  I wasn't totally thrilled with the ending of the Hunger Games, but Katniss would eventually rebuild her life with someone who loved her.  She made her sacrifices, and paid the price, but she survived.<br /><br />Was it necessary to kill Tris off, especially when she survived the serum? What was the point of risking her life (to save a brother who betrayed her), suffering, surviving, and then killing her needlessly, other then to shock us all?  She deserved more, as in real life how many people would offer their lives?<br /><br />Again, this is my opinion. Divergent was great, more then great.  Insurgent was very good, though a tad less then the first book.  Allegiant had so much promise and to me was a major disappointment. and paled in comparison to the first two books.VR did make them all throughout.

B00AZMFO6I|5.0|If you love great music, see this film.<br />If you love splendid acting, see it.<br />If you love superb photography, see it.<br />If you love a love story with all that connotes, see this film.<br /><br />It was hard for me to accept the truth that this was Dustin Hoffman's debut as a director. (Be sure to take the time after you watch the movie to also watch his commentary regarding the making of the movie -- such things as off-the-script moments that he kept in the film, for instance. Years ago I watched a documentary about Verdi House in Italy, a retirement home for impoverished retired opera singers established by the great Verdi himself, so I was not surprised to learn it played a part in the story behind this film.)<br /><br />This is a beautiful, touching, tender, very human tribute to the human condition. As far as I could see, there wasn't a false step anywhere, even in the smallest bit part. And the main characters? Simply wonderful.<br /><br />A first-class delight in all respects.
1451666179|5.0|Hysterical and heartfelt content in a beautifully produced book. Can't recommend it enough. I could read stories about Helper Dog and Simple Dog forever. Brosh is brutally honest with both herself and the reader as she describes some of the challenges she has in life, but at the same time always seems to find the humor in every situation.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|A peculiar album, but honest and very interesting. The lyrics were way ahead of the times, and some musical effects were also not ready at the time. In the 21st century, it may feel a bit outdated but it quickly catches on. I bought it after seeing &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; and was pleased.

B003V1WXKU|3.0|I really didn't know what to expect when I started reading &#34;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!&#34; other than that I would learn about some interesting stories about the incredible Richard Feynman.  The stories are worth reading, but I think they could have been told better.  I'm sure it would have been riveting to hear the stories in person coming straight from Feynman's mouth, but the book would have benefited from a good storyteller filling in the pauses and gaps.<br /><br />Considering how brilliant the man was, I also thought the language used was overly simplistic and sort of rambled on.  On the one hand, it's charming that he was such a down-to-earth guy, but on the other hand the stories just weren't as exciting as those I had read in other books about Richard Feynman.  It felt like I was listening to the raw, uncut footage from a PBS interview.  After reading it, I found out that the book was put together from audio recordings of his reminiscing to one of his close friends--which completely explains the tone and reminiscent, conversational writing style.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Ones you get over the first twenty seconds of the movie which actually is one of the worse clips of the middle of the movie, you'll start thinking its not such a bad movie, inters rooster Cogburn, and no not the good one played by John Wayne in the original version of True Grit...No sir, it's Jeff Bridges with his only badly acted character ever, yes its 100% the same character, with the same bad non coherent southern accent...Bottom line is if Jeff Bridges was ether his normal self or even more like his dude character from Big Lebowski, this movie might have worked, or better yet if Mr. Bridges stayed home and Tommy Lee Jones did his part and Will Smith did the other guy's part 5 stars would be in order...But please realize that I am 52 years old and a big fan of Jeff Bridges with the exception of his rooster Cogburn act, and he brought rooster Cogburn with little of no alteration to a movie which is basically a sophisticated and semi realistic looking cartoon. Movies like that needs a respectable character so we can be surprised when they are funny, not a vagabond with a speech impediment.
B002M9WW30|2.0|All six Rocky films are included here, but I am disheartened at the lack of special features. In the interest of full disclosure, I found this as a Deal of the Day for $20, on sale from around $60, so I jumped at it without delving too deeply into details. Still, although a disc of bonus materials is included, its nothing like I was expecting, given that the original Rocky was an Academy Award winner for Best Picture, as well as such a landmark achievement for Sylvester Stalone. Where's the commentary track? Where are the making -of documentaries? I don't regret my purchase. However, had I paid closer to full price, I might have done. In short, to say this is the Undisputed collection is a bit overblown. Had this movie collection treated even just the first two films with the attention to detail in the extras department which they deserve, this collection would have been a complete knockout.

B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I am a long time comic book reader.  So I was very interested in reading this book.  It was a very enjoyable read, and I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />That being said, I think it was a bit awkward for me to have traditional comic book rules described in a narrative form like this.  It sort of exposes how far we have to go to suspend disbelief to read a comic book.  Things we take as given in a comic book are specifically identified as rules in this book.  But where we glance over it in a comic book in this longer narrative form they are listed but basically identified as a mystery the book has no intention of solving.<br /><br />If you've read the Look Inside sample, what follows is not a spoiler (if you have not, it is a spoiler):<br /><br />The primary example I'm thinking of is the every epic has a weakness thing.  In comic books, there have always been heroes and villains and they've almost all had some weakness or another.  In Steelheart, it's set in a world that was the same as ours until a mystery event created a bunch of superhumans.  Then going on to say that all these people who simultaneously gained a diverse set of powers also have a similarly diverse set of weaknesses just emphasizes how much we are asked to accept without any explanation.  Reading the Look Inside sample also shows how corny those superhuman names can be.  I suppose in a comic book it happens without thinking about it because you read them as a kid.  Of *course* &#34;Superman&#34; is vulnerable to &#34;kryptonite&#34;, and the &#34;Green Lantern&#34; is vulnerable to the color yellow!  But I think a story that is set somewhere that's supposed to be like our normal world and then suddenly superhumans appear should have more of an explanation for those things.  Presumably Sanderson will deal with some or all of that in a sequel or two, but in this first book it was a bit off putting.

B00A287PG2|4.0|Insightful and balanced look at The Firm, the good and the bad.  McKinsey is a unique organization with deep global influence.  Mr. McDonald has done a great job revealing its impact on the world
B00FBTKFFA|4.0|Look, the man has pipes. He also has an innate feel, unlike latter day Rod Stewart, for the soul of these songs. He delivers them with genuine emotion, and while his take may not be one's favourite, truth is, they are the pure drop. So, my advice is get the deluxe edition because you will aso get most of the studio CD live and live, Mick rules. And he finishes the whole thing off with Money's Too Tight, which was completely inspired by this catalog. Simply Red isn't coming back, so get over it. Not everything this guy has done or will do will ever measure up fully to that band's strongest moments, but he hasn't sold his soul down the river. This is a very satisfying set to my ears. Give it a good listen on the samples, and if you're convinced it is valid on your terms, get the set with the live second disc. You will not regret it at all.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|this device is surprisingly easy to use.  the battery life is quite long.  it almost works as well as the built-in bluetooth of my other cars
1451695195|5.0|Excellent book. It can make a lasting impact on your life .The experience is mind boggling and worth it. Read it ASAP.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|This is a standard SlimPort Adapter. I purchased this because my MHL-HDMI bridge that had worked for my previous Android smartphones no longer worked for my Nexus 4. This phone required this newer, different SlimPort technology. This works just as well as the MHL-HDMI bridge technology with little noticeable difference. The only improvement in this version is connection reliability. This bridge works 100% of the time with my Nexus 4, whereas the MHL-HDMI bridge sometimes required multiple tries to connect and setup. Requires HDMI cable to interface, this is not included. Charging cable to power the connection is optional. The bridge works without added power from a charger. It will, however, quickly drain your battery without this additional power input, so be ready. This particular adapter was a bit on the expensive side compared to the $10 MHL-HDMI bridges that I was used to.<br /><br />Overall a good purchase for the Nexus 4 or any other smartphone requiring this protocol.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|This was a lot like the other movies of it's kind.  Back a few months ago I watched quite a few movies like this.  I found them all interesting and informative with slightly different takes on our food industry.
B0026PW67W|5.0|It is beautiful!  The paper is really nice.  I feel like it's right out of the movie.  I will recommend this every time.
B00ENNA62W|4.0|Since Amazon condenses the reviews of multiple formats into one pile, I hope this one stands out.  It covers the new 25th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD combo pack from Funimation, NOT Bandai'a 2009 Blu-ray or one of the many earlier DVD releases.  I was able to get an advance copy from Funimation and also used it to write a separate full-length review of this title, listed below.<br /><br />\\"Akira\\" still holds up perfectly well after 25 years.  The film condenses a LOT of material into two hours; not surprising, since writer/director Katsuhiro Otomo's long-running manga series was still being written after its 1988 release.  This epic, violent, mind-melting slice of animated history is chock full of terrific visuals, an amazing soundtrack and, of course, the sci-fi tinged story that introduced many to Kaneda, Tetsuo and company.  Those new to the film will find it an exhausting experience, but don't give up: the eye candy will suck you in, but there's a real heart and soul to the story that has made countless fans worldwide return to \\"Akira\\" again and again.  It's practically the grandfather of modern anime.<br /><br />But that's not what most people want to know; they're probably just curious how this Blu-ray stacks up to previous releases (pretty well, as it turns out).  Video quality is ever-so-slightly better than Bandai's 2009 Blu-ray: the image is no longer \\"picture-boxed\\" (thin black bars on all four sides) and the colors appear more well-defined and evenly saturated.  It's the same 2001 master, so don't expect a night-and-day difference...but it's there.  On the audio front, we get two excellent DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio versions of the original Japanese track and the 2001 Pioneer English dub, as well as a new DTS-HD 2.0 Master Audio version of the older 1998 Streamline English dub.  The choice of both English dubs is a nice touch, as I'd imagine that many long-time fans (including myself) have a nostalgic connection to the older one.  English subtitles are included for translation purposes only.  No dubtitles!<br /><br />The bonus features, by and large, are similar to Pioneer's 2001 Special Edition DVD...which itself borrowed plenty of extras from the company's older Laserdisc release.  Two are missing, however: the excellent \\"Akira Production Report\\" (a vintage behind-the-scenes documentary) and a gallery of promotional images.  Otherwise, it's pretty much business as usual, but die-hard fans might still want to hold on to those Special Edition DVDs.<br /><br />So essentially, we get a slight visual upgrade, the addition of Streamline's 1988 English dub and many (but not all) of the vintage extras not included on  Bandai's 2009 Blu-ray.  Funimation's 25th Anniversary Edition is definitely worth a purchase if you don't own \\"Akira\\" on Blu-ray yet, but those that do might not want to bother.<br /><br />For more details, please check out my full-length review at: [...]for translation purposes only.

B0001HAISG|1.0|When I received my package of the DVD, it looked perfectly fine from the outside. However, when I opened it, the DVD case and DVD itself were dented and I was unable to play it. Very upset.
B002WN8IQQ|4.0|Liked the music. Volume is an issue. Some parts were low and had to be turned up. Other areas were then too loud.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Don't know what the deal is, but this app no longer functions. What a shame. I love Pinterest, but your upgrades are not tested, apparently.
B009LDD5E0|5.0|In addition to enjoying the entire 4th season whenever I want to view, I liked having the special features on a couple of the DVD's.  Fun to get an inside look at producing the show or interviews from the actors.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|Don't listen to the people who rate movies, that decided if there good or not. If the preview is bad the movie is good, and this movie was better than you would think.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Even though it's now a feature film, don't take the shortcut; Ender's Game is well worth reading in book form.<br /><br />There are reviews aplenty that provide a synopsis so there is no need for me to add another here. Suffice it to say Orson Scott Card weaves a masterful tale of children bred to be the warriors in a battle for mankind's survival.<br /><br />The amazing tale of Ender, Valentine and Peter Wiggins shows Card's theatrical background as he skillfully presents an interstellar struggle for survival played out on a tiny stage with a small cast of well-developed characters.<br /><br />Ender' Game is a thought-provoking and rewarding read: I recommend it highly.
B0098460O4|5.0|They are two amazing talented young people. I will be buying more of their CD's and hopefully DVD's. Let me know as they are released.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Only read enough to make me realize everyone had a deep dark secret and weren't really very nice people.  I had enough and am deleting it from my Kindle.  What a waste of $7.99
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This show continuously holds my interest. I can't wait to watch the next episode.<br />the interaction of the cast is as though they are real. Great acting and story
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I had a hard time putting the book down. The author really held my interest in the story.
B0091REZMW|4.0|My kid and I both play! It's a fight to get my kindle back! We love it! And it's free.
0142410705|4.0|Colin Singleton is a 17 year-old child prodigy. He fluently speaks 11 languages, won a teen academic game show, reads at least 400 pages every day, and is going to Northeastern University on a full scholarship; however, he does not think he is a genius. To him, a prodigy is someone that excels at learning about other peoples' work, but a genius is someone who creates their own work to make a difference in the world-- to matter. Recently, Colin has been feeling as if he has already reached his prime-- that he will never matter or be remembered by anyone. Over the course of his life, the only girls he has ever dated all have two things in common: they are all named Katherine, and they all dumped him. Upon graduating high school, Katherine #19 inevitably dumps Colin, leaving him feeling even more insignificant and depressed. Throughout John Green's Abundance of Katherines, Colin must prove to himself that he can matter, by creating an original theorem would that ideally predict the outcome of any romantic relationship and who will be the dumper, and who will be the `dumpee'.<br /><br />  I found Abundance of Katherines to be very relatable, intriguing, and entertaining, while still being a fairly easy read. I really enjoyed Green's use of footnotes throughout the novel: while some of them were simply there to provide translations or definitions of words, others were genuinely interesting and entertaining, providing greater overall enjoyment of the text. I also really appreciated Green's use of diagrams and graphs to support the complicated math used by Colin to form his theorem. He somehow found a way to make it simple enough for a reader lacking math knowledge without dumbing down the story. Green even included an optional appendix at the end of the book, where the entire math behind Colin's theorem was thoroughly explained. At one point, Green even had the formula on his website so that readers could input variables from their own relationships to see how Colin wouldexpect it to end; however, since then, it has been taken down from his site. Readers can still input your unique variables into the theorem using a graphing calculator if they are interested.<br /><br />  I did not always like some of the characters, but I found most of them to be very relatable and well developed. Colin, although he is a child prodigy, has many insecurities and struggles to be social, while also struggling to move on from his countless break-ups. We all try to find reasons or explanations as to why someone doesn't like us, but we find a way to move on and cope with our problems, as does Colin. Green does a great job of dealing with emotional complexity, as he uses the perfect combination of drama and comedy to make it relatable, yet enjoyable to read. Overall, the plot is interesting and entertaining, but at some points I found the story to be moving very slowly. I had heard a lot of very high praise for John Green and his books, but Abundance of Katherines was the first one I have read. By no means was it a bad book, but it did not fully live up to my expectations, which was somewhat expected. I recommend this book to young adult readers looking for a relatable and intriguing book, and I look forward to reading some of John Green's other novels.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|!series is well written and has a perfect cast. It transports you to another time and place. Definitely a good thing on some days
0060825456|5.0|I ordered this book for my ninth grade students, and they love it! They are struggling readers, so the graphic novel format is much more approachable to them than the original version of the book, and they like how creepy the story is. The illustrations are high quality, full color, and semi-glossy. However, the illustrations are slightly less creepy than what I imagined when I read the original version of the novel, but that is to be expected.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great buy, and I would definitely make this purchase again!
B00003CXCS|5.0|Great musical, stars, songs and scenery.  One of my favorites and my 4 and 5 year old grand children enjoyed it as well.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have different device for streaming media but I haven't experience problems than using google Chromecast. Unfortunately, i can't find the device all the time! sometimes it works fine and most of the time doesn't work. I send message to google explaining my problem but their answer looks like they didn't read my explaining because I told them in my message that the solution in their website doesn't work with me at all. But they send me again the same step solutions that I already tried it.<br /><br />Bad customer service after sales.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I read it one hundred times<br />Had to take a break around fifty thou<br />But a good book that I recommend it for all ages
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Really enjoyed reading about the past presidents and behind the scene events. It was interesting hearing about the relationships and alliances that began. Very informative about past and present presidents and how they worked together for what they felt was the betterment of our country.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I purchased the upgrade version of the game (4.99 version); and I get the &quot;Force Close&quot; error message constantly. It's annoying because I shouldn't have to keep re-opening the application.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Love it.  Engaging.  Earthy.  Detailed.  A great read.  Can't wait to get the next GOT book!  It's that good, and I am amazed to see how close the HBO series represents the book.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love the show and the actors so how can it miss.  There are lots of laughs and we all need that these days.  Laughter is a magic medicine and we need as much as we can get!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I open this once in a while, usually pretty accurate Great app useful &amp; easy to use. Free is always nice
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The writing and story line were just as great as the first two books. I love the characters. I felt like I actually knew them. The descriptions were so vivid, it was like I was there. However, I absolutely hated the way this book ends. It just did not do the series justice.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Nice when Disney doesn't screw things up. This was quite good, hopefully Disney artists aren't going to waife her out over the next years while integrating her into their one body/hair/skin tone type fits all princess lineup.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is so amazing! So sad the series is ending now! BEST SERIES EVER! EVERYONE SHOULD READ IT THEY WON'T REGRET IT!
B00AE2J93I|5.0|Nice twists on zombies, the hero's journey (remember the days when young hero's used their power to encourage love, and forgiveness?), while dancing a line between stereotypes and well developed characters.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I can't stop playing this game almost ready to download part 2 download you won't waste your time I promise you of that
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This fits more into young adult (Graveyard bookesqe) than into more mature works (American Gods, Anansi Boys), until the very last chapter, which subtley twists a knife into the part of the soul that looses it way.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush it's so addicting. I just hate the chocolate..lol. Some levels are very challenging and others easy.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Such a flawless, easy set up, for the price this device can't be beat. I use it a lot at my girlfriend's house who doesn't have a smart TV. I typically use it to watch Netflicks streaming from my Ipad. What is cool is that you can stream it and then still use your ipad for other web surfing.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|House of Cards will quickly become your favorite political drama, if you have any interest at all in the dark underbelly of D.C. politics.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is amazing as Frank Underwood, and in a way, he revives his southern gent mannerisms of &#34;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&#34; right down to the accent and the angry outbursts.<br /><br />As Congressman Underwood, he is much more deviant and manipulative, and I believe his character (and that of his wife) is a melting pot of the worst D.C. has to offer. Reminds one of the Clintons, but &#34;on steroids&#34;.<br /><br />The gratuitous sex is, well, gratuitous, and some of the episodes present as &#34;fillers&#34; between the true plot line episodes, but overall, this twisted dark drama is the stuff Emmy nominations are made of.<br /><br />Spacey at his absolute best, with supporting characters who are, for the most part, believable...allowing one to become lost in the plot without having to say &#34;that's not plausible&#34;.<br /><br />As for personal experience,my wife and I began watching the series, and finished all 13 episodes of season 1 in less than 5 days.<br /><br />Yes..it's that gripping!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|WHY WHY WHY!!!!!! I am so mad right now just finished and uh oh here come da SPOILERS watch out<br /><br />The few reasons I hated this book<br /><br />1.WHO KILLS THE MAIN CHARACTER !!!!WHO OH I KNOW VR DOSE<br /><br />2 I do t understand half of the book about genectly pure or damaged what that mean l I keep \\" of I'm sorry your genes are damaged here live in this tent for the rest of YOUR LIFE !! !!<br /><br />3 why why why did UHRAIH DIE that is just plain stupid!!<br /><br />I love this Siers but now....... well u get the point
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have several Rokus that can't stream youtube and a modern large Panasonic Plasma and a large Sharp LCD that do stream youtube terribly.<br /><br />This device fits works seamlessly with all of the Android and IOS devices in the house for control and I would definitely recommend it as a great value.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This movie had quite an impact on our (American) cinema culture when it arrived. It is sort of generic and leans toward style over substance, just like our culture does. It is derivative, but most things are to some degree. There is little in the way of dialog, which really only hurts the movie in terms of attachment to the characters. Which is to say that there is little to none. The only thing that makes you root for the main character at all is that she volunteered to go in her sister's stead. Otherwise, there is little that  make one want her to live anymore than anyone else. So far as the others, are concerned, it is hard to begin to develop an opinion when there was no development of the characters. With that said, I will probably watch the sequel because, why not?
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Heart wrenching and eye opening. A good read, as well. I wish this became a must read in all high schools. Things need to change to make those people who suffer from the disease, as relaxed, comfortable and pertinent as possible. A special thank you to the author for spending your education, time and experience on this subject.
0061950726|5.0|I could not wait to tell my friends about this wonderful novel. Kline beautifully captures the experience of the orphan train riders and sheds new light and a little known part of our history. We learn that many children had their names changed to suit the whims of their new owners/families and all remnants of their former lives were removed. Although some children were truly wanted and were adopted by loving families, many more were taken in and used for unpaid labor. These children had no one looking out for them and they had no where to turn.<br /><br />Kline also does a wonderful job delving into the modern day foster care system in the character of teenager Molly. The intersection of Molly and Vivian's lives is set in motion when Molly steals a ratty copy of Jane Eyre from the library just because she wants to own something for herself. As Molly completes her community service helping Vivian clean out her attic, we are treated to beautiful memories of both of their lives and Molly finally feels that someone cares for her.
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|The 1st dvd from season one had some issues with sound and freezing in a few places.  All of the rest of the dvds were fine and I loved the series.  I did not notify the seller about the problem with the one dvd.
B00BO4GTG0|5.0|I would stop there if they would let me stop before the review hit 20 words.<br /><br />Great images, great work, Paper to Petal is original and fun. I think what impresses me most is that it really serves a dual purpose as both a detailed how-to book and a showcase of beautiful work to draw inspiration from simultaneously. I know that's really the intent of most books in this genre, but it's pretty difficult to find books that really fulfill both of those roles as well as I feel this one does.<br /><br />Still not sold?<br />There's a forward from Martha Stewart for Christ's sake! If the queen ain't enough of a reason for you to trust that this book is money well spent, I don't think anything is. (I would also suggest you seriously re-evaluate your life choices...just saying.)
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Trying to piece together a puzzle with many pieces missing can be very difficult. But like many scientist, archeologists and historians before him, Aslan does an admirable job of putting together available information to paint his own picture of Jesus, the man.<br />(Bill Bryson does a similar work with 'biography' of Shakespeare - much more humorous and less controversial)<br /><br />This is a thoroughly enjoyable and insightful narrative.<br />I can however see why some 'zealots' may be offended.
B000FA5STS|5.0|Baldacci readers will love this.  Tangled and riveting as he does best.  Don't know if it was ever a movie, but it would be exciting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Cruch Saga can be very addicting, and at times it is also extremely frustrating, but also very  very entertaining!!!
0061906220|5.0|The Pete the Cat series is a  great one.  I especially like this book because is has a moral without preaching.  Pete finds his way and makes us laugh along the journey.  I work in a library, and children love Pete!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The first book was great<br />The second book was pretty good<br />This book was ehh good, but....<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />For one, I can live with Tris going in the death serum instead of Caleb. However, David being in there also was not needed. Tris was impervious to the death serum. She could have lived. Instead, there was shock value and she died.<br /><br />For two, I like a good redemption story. I think all books should have character redemption somewhere. Caleb could have redeemed himself by going in instead of Tris.<br /><br />The ending was poor. Four hated his father, why would he be a politician like his father.<br /><br />Sometimes an author does not know how to end a trilogy. This happened in Mockingjay as well.<br /><br />Still a good book, just create your own ending.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Wonderful story, not nearly as depressing as his first two books. However, it was confusing at times. Because the book bounces back and forth, names were difficult to remember and it was not sure at times who was talking or to whom they were talking. But eventually everything is cleared up. a truly classic story about family and love spanning over fifty plus years.
8867320793|2.0|While functionality is the same as the other Moleskine books - this doesn't quite carry the same class as the other books (the Hobbit does make it look quite cheap - and probably hence the discount).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun to play and just like the movie, loving all the different minions and sound effects, great game!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|This watch is great - works brilliantly.  The main issue is the touch bezel which just doesn't have the quality of the other parts of the watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. I would recommend it to anyone. One can spend hours playing this game. It also keeps you in touch with friends.
B00CUKTGW6|5.0|Nice job Mick Jones on awesome remastering of the 5 clash Albums. Love hearing the different layering that was missing on the originals. Definitely worth the re-buy on this one!
B009UNH0EM|1.0|I got my package from amazon today and opened it up to find half a plastic bag that had been cut open and there was no cable to be found.
1433502399|5.0|My bible was falling apart.  This bible is a bit heavy,  but if you want to dig into the Word,  it's lovely.  The notes are comprehensive and I very much enjoy the ESV translation.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|No, it's not the most difficult game, but it's clever and well done, and was just hard enough to keep me engrossed for a couple of hours.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|This is an awesome set. Lots of pieces for the price in my opinion. The only thing that would have improved the set would be a hoverboard and the front windows of the delorean being a little more solid. They can separate easily as the hinges are only attached to the hood and not the roof of the car. Overall really nice collector set and I recommend this, especially for the price.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Ok, after all that hype I got it.  It works great, its easy to use, but it only has two apps: Netfix and Hulu.... I only use Netflix.<br /><br />Anyone one if this product is going to develop?
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I am completely hooked on this show!  It is one of the best TV shows I've seen in a long time.  A definite must watch!  It has everything action, suspense, mystery, emotion.  I can't believe the main actress in this was not nominated for an emmy.  She is wonderful. She plays the different parts so well that you forget it is the same actress!
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|This book desperately needs editing. I loved the exert in the New York Times Sunday Magazine which was short and compact. The long lectures contained in the book are unnecessary. It was obvious from the beginning Kalden was Ty. And the symbolism of the shark, octopus, and seahorse was a bit too overt.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|And now my 3 year old is hooked.  I know some people out there had problems with this movie and were disappointed.  Not me.  I thought it was awesome.  Jason Segal and Amy Adams were awesome too.  I am such a big fan of both of them (from Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Superman to Enchanted and How I Met Your Mother... and not the Muppets).  I admit, I was giddy watching this movie.  I can't wait for the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So excited that Amazon finally got candy crush.  One of the few games I enjoy!  Yes, I am addicted to this game.  Thank you...
B00BW7FHJY|1.0|I was excited to see that this excellent cycle of the Beethoven nine symphonies was newly released in Blu-ray format. Unfortunately, the master tapes evidently were not high definition as the blu-ray edition is only marginally better than the DVD series, which I have.<br />Sadly, this purchase was a waste of my money. The performances and sound are wonderful, but there is minimal improvement in the picture.
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|the tension in the story is enormous, the role of MI5 is as expected.  The choice of words is sophisticated and is to my taste more British than useful.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I'm really impatient and always want to get to the ending. I knew after reading \\"Gone Girl\\" there would be a big surprise, but I did not see this ending coming.<br /><br />This is a fabulous book by a fabulous author. It is so rare to be surprised in an entirely unexpected way by a book. So many tales are old and tired, but somehow Flynn spins a unique, twisted, disturbing and original tale.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|pretty stupid corny movie. i felt like i was watching cheap japanese sci fi move. it may be worth watching in 3D for the effects, but that's about it.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I found it frustrating to read at times but it kept my interest enough that I kept coming back to it.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|i am so sick and tired of zombie movies. the only reason i wanted to watch it was because brad pitt was in it so i figured it would be different but i was wrong. i didnt even know it was a zombie movie until i watched it.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Alzheimer's hits very close to home for my family.. My great grandmother had it, and was much like Alice in the end of the book. Her husband had died before her, and the only people she had left were her 3 children, many grandchildren and even more great grandchildren. The disease that took over my great grandma's body, made it so hard for me to go see her. It killed me inside to know that she didn't remember any of us. Needless to say, by the end of the book I was in full blown tears. Highly recommended read!!
B008I34YYY|3.0|I was led to expect, after following the hype and crowdsourcing, an invasion movie something like Independence Day. I expected dieselpunk Space Nazis to come to earth, blowing up Icons Of Freedom, until a new Greatest Generation of Allies would push them back and challenge the Nazi's Ultimate Weapon in space.<br /><br />Instead I got bunch hackneyed political farce with all the sophistication of a stoned 40 year old hippie freshman from UC Berkeley. A few seconds of &#34;invasion&#34; and a &#34;coming of age/learning the world&#34; love story. great special effects though.<br /><br />Next time, more invasion, less foreign interpretation of low information pop politics. I can get that for free on the radio or youtube.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|LOVE the Tudors!!! I didn't get a chance to watch It on showtime, so I thought i'd take advantage of the unlimited streaming my amazon prime allows me & WOW am I glad I did for I cannot get enough of the Tudors.Johnathan Meyers is in my opinion the perfect cast for Henry I am not a scholar so I cannot say if all the dates & timeframes are accurate,but I can say I think The Tudors is Well Acted  & Well Written & Praise to the costume designer.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Wasn't sure to watch it, but glad I did. Not the best performances, but still very entertaining movie to watch.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This version is a little &#34;slow&#34; to me.  But it is a good game for persons needing something to do while waiting around for life to happen or when you are bored with other things.

B005LAIH9A|3.0|I thought the movie was pretty good. My complaint refers to the regular version, as that is the one I saw. For some strange reason it seems that every other R-Rated comedy feels compelled to graphically show the penis. Not just a fleeting glimpse but rather an extended perfectly lit close-up, as in this film. I have no problem with this, except that this level of nudity is NEVER done with females.<br /><br />With women, whenever there is a frontal nude scene the crotch area will always be censored with a merkin (fake pubic hair). Yet when it comes to males, the audience is treated to graphic shots of total non obstructed male genitals. Just watch this film, or Hall Pass, or Bruno, or shows like Spartacus.<br /><br />Just once it would be nice to see some female nudity on the same level as the male nudity. Can anyone imagine a mainstream R-Rated movie having a scene where the camera zooms in for an extended close-up of a woman's totally shaved vagina. It would never happen. Yet that level of nudity for males is not uncommon. Just watch this film (regular version).<br /><br />It seems that the basic rule of thumb for your typical raunchy R-rated film is that the female nudity will be limited to just breasts, but the male nudity will include multiple graphic shots of actual genitals. It is an extremely bizarre double standard, and one that really should end.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|This movie was good but not the miracle of modern cinema that some people make it out to be. it had its moments of excitement, but also moments that made ya go \\"Hunh?\\"<br /><br />You have to suspend disbelief a number of times to accept the stupidity of some of the characters, or even whole populations.
B00EIL7E9C|3.0|I love this show. But there is one thing that drives me nuts. They CENSOR all the frontal nude scenes featuring women, yet NEVER do it with the men.<br /><br />What I mean by that is that whenever a woman does a full nude scene they ALWAYS have the woman wearing a laugh out loud, ridiculous looking merkin (fake pubic hair) to conceal the crotch area. In some scenes it looked as though they taped a strip of a black garbage bag over the woman's crotch. It looks ridiculous. It's not just this show. Hollywood ALWAYS censors the vagina with merkins, but it looks especially ridiculous in this show.<br /><br />Moreover, this show has shown the penis MANY times, including one episode that featured a nude man laying on a table as the camera slowly pans over his penis for a CLOSE-UP. Yet when it comes to frontal nudity for the women, the crotch is always hidden with a merkin.<br /><br />If you're not going to censor the the genitals for men then don't do it with the women. But unfortunately ever since women started grooming in a manner where the crotch would be exposed, Hollywood always uses merkins to hide the vagina. It's a bizarre nudity double standard. With men they don't hesitate to show everything including actual genitals, yet with women they always use a cover up (merkin) to hide the genitals. It's a practice that really should end.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great graphics, it seems a bit simple at first then it starts to get more challenging and fun. Great game!
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|Yes my friends, Swedish melodic death metal masters Soilwork have once again returned in a big time way with their ninth studio album and their first ever double album 2013's &#34;The Living Infinite&#34; which is an 84 minute plus, 20 track monument of pure modern melodic death metal epicness from start to finish. Ever since my first listen of &#34;Natural Born Chaos&#34; ten years ago, I've been a huge fan of Soilwork and have gotten just about every album of theirs since then. Now this album to put it plain and simple, it is just absolutely phenomenal, and it's also the best album that Soilwork has put out thus far in my opinion as well. Every song on &#34;The Living Infinite&#34; just rattles my ears throughout with amazing musicianship and brilliant lyrics and songwriting. The album's production which is handled by Jens Bogren (who also handles the mixing and mastering) is simply outstanding. This album also marks the debut of guitarist David Andersson who replaces guitarist and founder Peter Wichers (who once again left the band in 2012), and he proves to be a very worthy replacement for Wichers. Together, David along with other guitarist Sylvain Coudret (who debuted on the band's previous release &#34;The Panic Broadcast&#34;) both deliver an all out attack of heavily, bruising, and spitfire riffs and fantastic leads and solos throughout. Meanwhile the band's rhythm section of bassist Ola Flink and drummer Dirk Verbeuren is simply put mind blowing especially Dirk's drumming on here which definitely surpasses everything he's done ever since debuting on 2005's &#34;Stabbing the Drama&#34;. He just goes from merciless blast beat pounding to double bass pedal slamming and everything in between on here. Eleswhere, keyboardist Sven Karlsson sees more time in the spotlight as he delivers excellent keyboard textures and effects, and of course topping all that off are frontman Bjorn &#34;Speed&#34; Strid's every so amazing vocals blending from aggressive and heavy death growls and screams to powerful and soaring melodic clean vocals which sound much more stronger and hungrier than ever before. Speed is definitely an amazing talent, no questions asked.<br /><br />Highlights on Disc 1<br /><br />The first disc's ferocious opener &#34;Spectrum of Eternity&#34; starts off with a nice symphonic intro and then kicks into an explosive onslaught of bruising, spitfire riffs, ferocious blasting drums, and aggressive vocal work, and there's also a soaring melodic chorus plus a great melodic solo soon followed by an even faster shredding solo as well. Track three &#34;This Momentary Bliss&#34; is another blistering yet cheery and dance-inducing headbanger highlighted by a catchy opening guitar harmony lead that almost echoes that of the intro harmony lead from &#34;Needlefeast&#34; from &#34;A Predator's Portrait&#34;, meanwhile track four &#34;Tongue&#34; is yet another ferocious bruiser which anchors more fiery riffing, intense screams, relentless blasting, along with some cathcy clean sung pre-choruses which are backed by pummeling blast beats and another soaring melodic chorus, as well as another gorgeous melodic solo followed by another blistering solo backed by more pounding drums. Other highlights on Disc 1 include &#34;The Living Infinite I&#34; which features a slow acoustic intro which later gives way to melodic keyboards and melodic riffing, and then later some surging, thrashy riffs, and the song also features an excellent melody induced spiraling solo, as well as &#34;Vesta&#34; which boasts a really cool western like sounding acoustic opening along with some chunky, chugging riffs and deft drumming, and yet another memorable melodic sung chorus, and then there's &#34;Realm of the Wasted&#34; which anchors more heavy pounding drums and hot surging riffs, along with more fantastic soloing and another memorable chorus.<br /><br />Highlights on Disc 2<br /><br />Now, the second disc kicks off immediately with the instrumental &#34;Entering Aeons&#34; that builds up with slow, menacing yet steady and melodic riffs and some drilling double bass slamming and then some clean guitar notes all leading right into the next track &#34;Long Live the Misanthrope&#34; which is highlighted by an onslaught of rip roaring guitars and pounding drums, plus heavy screams and growls as well as an excellent chorus and some more fantastic melodic soloing to boot. &#34;Drowning With Silence&#34; is another highlight that features a catchy, pounding groove with yet more rip roaring riffs and deft, driving drums and a gorgeous melodic sweep picking solo, and another awesome chorus, meanwhile &#34;Antidotes in Passing&#34; is a much more atmospheric and melodic cut highlighted by Speed's amazing clean singing abilities throughout the song, and elsewhere &#34;Leech&#34; brings back the brutality with an all out vicious beatdown anchored by hot, hellacious riffing, and sickening, maniacal blast beat attacks, and ferocious vocals to boot. Other highlights here on Disc 2 include &#34;The Living Infinite II&#34; (which boasts a beautiful acoustic guitar intro before going into some more heavier riffage and pounding thuds, and Speed delivers another phenomenal vocal performance as usual), as well as &#34;Rise Above the Sentiment&#34; (which anchors marching double bass thuds, as well as massive groove induced riffs, and some brief thrash tempos and another great solo backed by some pumping blast beats), and the closing track &#34;Owls Predict, Oracles Stand Guard&#34; (which is dominated by some steady yet blistering double bass drumming from Dirk).<br /><br />So all in all, &#34;The Living Infinite&#34; is truly a phenomenal 84+ minute two disc collection of pure brutal melodic death metal madness that will blow your mind away from beginning to end. This album is no question Soilwork's best and most diverse album yet thus far, and it shows an absolute perfect blend of brutality and melody throughout with all 20 songs flowing ever so perfectly from one song to the next. Trust me, &#34;The Living Infinite&#34; is definitely worth the dollars...Strongly Recommended!!! \m/<br /><br />Jeremyslow, menacing yet steady and melodic riffs and some drilling double bass slamming and then some clean guitar notes all leading right into the next track &#34;Long Live the Misanthrope&#34; which is highlighted by an onslaught of rip roaring guitars and pounding drums, plus heavy screams and growls as well as an excellent chorus and some more fantastic melodic soloing to boot. &#34;Drowning With Silence&#34; is another highlight that features a catchy, pounding groove with yet more rip roaring riffs and deft, driving drums and a gorgeous melodic sweep picking solo, and another awesome chorus, meanwhile &#34;Antidotes in Passing&#34; is a much more atmospheric and melodic cut highlighted by Speed's amazing clean singing abilities throughout the song, and elsewhere &#34;Leech&#34; brings back the brutality with an all out vicious beatdown anchored by hot, hellacious riffing, and sickening, maniacal blast beat attacks, and ferocious vocals to boot.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  I wanted Christian Grey right before me and his awesome hair too :)<br />It is so sensual and sad at the same time.
B001CUI658|5.0|Excellent book. Excellent price. Fast shipping.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Awesome show, great actors, love where they have taken the story line.  It just keeps getting better and better. It's a must see Show
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|IT WAS A LITTLE SLOW BUT THE CONCEPT WAS UNUSUAL AND I THOUGHT THAT THE FATHER/SON WORKED TOGETHER WELL AND COMPLIMENTED EACH OTHER.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Awesome characters, well-timed humor, excellent actors.  I know there are a million lawyer shows on TV, but this is one of my all time favorites!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I've never read anything about the &#34;Orphan Train&#34;. Interesting story of a very tough time in American history. The end was nice but I would have liked read about the meeting with Vivian's daughter.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I enjoyed this CD thoroughly.  Nice melodies, largely unobjectionable music.  It made for a pleasant distraction during an otherwise long day.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Looks like it will be nice to have product / service.  The device itself is very inexpensive.  It was however not simple to install and there is NO DOCUMENTATION to help.  It got on the wrong wireless network in my house and I had problems uninstalling it, then re-installing correctly.  Mostly by trial and error.  The costs of service plans from different vendors are not easy to find but some like UTube are free and fun to watch.  Controls to re-run portions of what you are watching are very crude and not easy to use.<br /><br />Overall --  it is a good entry point for this kind of service (Web downloaded TV programs) but you need some technical knowledge to install properly and use.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great app, love doing my shopping on this app. The bidding on there is in real time also so I get awesome deals
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My 4 year old son loves this movie.  I was skeptical at first, thinking it might be a little mature for him.  Maybe it is just a little.  There are some things in it that frighten him just a tad but really the story line is very cute.  There are even jokes thrown in for adults to chuckle at which is always a plus.
0316044695|5.0|great story... I love non-fiction and my brother recommended this book to me... action packed and written well from the perspective of the main character/author.  I love Navy SEAL documentaries but this was much different than anything I had seen on TV before and really got inside the head of SEAL.... those guys are intense.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I finished this book yesterday and I have just now started reading reviews and I'm sad that such negative things are being said about the author and attacks on her personally.  I re-read Divergent and Insurgent before starting Allegiant and read all 3 over the course of 4 days (note that I have 2 small children that keep me busy constantly or I think that timeframe would have been shorter).  I think re-reading the other books in the series helped me be in the mindset of this book from the start.  I did have a hard time with the story going back and forth between Tris and Tobias' POV, and I think Roth struggled to find his voice until the end.  I think overall there were slow parts to the beginning and some scenes left me wanting more, but the ending was emotional, shocking, and incredibly deep.  I sobbed for hours and the book has been on my mind constantly since I put it down.  The more I think about how the series is ending, the more I let it sink in, I know that it had to end the way it did, sad and beautiful.  It was not so much what happened at the climax, but the scenes of resolution with the characters that brought on such empathetic emotion. Because in real life, people die, people grieve, and they have to find a way to move on.<br /><br />The hateful bashes of this book are unwarranted. I know this book is targeted for young adults or teens, but I almost think this series ends above their heads with themes and emotions they would have a hard time understanding and that is why there is such harsh backlash.  I am only in my mid twenties, but I don't think 10 years ago I would have really appreciated the intelligent and thoughtful view of society and the depth that these characters had.  I have seen reviews saying you can't end this type of dystopian novel without leaving the reader with a sense of hope.  I believe that this book does end with hope, but not in the way some would have wanted, the sappy \\"happy ending.\\"  But in the real world you don't have happyendings all the time.  I loved the theme that everyone is damaged, and everyone can be mended.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and series. I have never loved characters as much as I loved Tris and Tobias. Looking forward to the rest of the Four short stories to come out.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|this screen works great... it does kill a battery in about 25 minutes, but when not needed I am sure to turn it off and my typical battery will last around 45 min.  I love this thing.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|While nothing like Enders Game, which I adored, this is vast goodness--even better than the first! A slow start that explodes in chapter after chapter.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Amazing.  I can hardly put this book down.  It has kept me on my toes trying to keep all the characters straight, but it has really kept me totally interested in the story.  Yes, it is an amazing book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so much fun and a little addicting. You could play this for ours. It's not that difficult, but it is challenging
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|It's a USB 3 gigabit ethernet adapter. It's very useful considering most laptops today, especially ultrabooks, do not have an ethernet jack. Many USB to ethernet adapters out there are actually USB 2.0, which means actual data throughput won't be as fast as you would expect. I bought this for my Macbook Air. It will not work out of the box. It comes with a small CD, but most ultrabooks, including Macbooks Air, do not even have an optical drive. You have to do to Anker's website first (just search for anker on Google/Bing). Of course, that can be a catch-22 if you need internet connection via ethernet in the first place. After installing the driver, it seems to work fine without any fuss. Works on Mountain Lion and Mavericks. I did have to re-install the driver when upgrading from Mountain Lion to Mavericks, FYI.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really love my Google Chromecast.  Having an Xbox it's kind of annoying to have to pay for the gold account just to have access for Netflix. This allows me to stream to my tv for free.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I enjoy their music and it is a good mix of clean songs with no objectionable language.  I can play it in my classroom at school with no worries, and the students enjoy it too.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Where the lyrics and sounds of Taylor swift are sweet and complex, Kelly belts out rock and roll hits like a veteran.  A must for aficionados of women lead singers.  In this album Kelly Clarkson croons powerfully and impressively.  Can't get it out of my head.
B007Q476KU|5.0|I have had so many people in my life, simply not understanding my love for animals. The intensity i feel when i know about an animal being abused or suffering. When i was in high school i saw on the news a dog being abused, soon after i found a dog in the street about to be hit by a car eventually the owner took the dog back but he said that he would let his dog walk around on its own in the street. When i graduated high school i adopted a dog from a shelter. She has been apart of me since that day like a soulmate. This movie made me cry not just because i have the same relationship with my dog as Albert in the movie has with joey. Its because i been waiting so long to see a movie that tells the point of view of what an animal can go through. Animals have no voice its our job to speak for them defend them and love them. Many of you may laugh at me or think nothing of what i say, but when you watch this movie you will learn. You will feel a compassion for that in which you may have forgotten. If you can tell someone to watch this movie they might learn a new found respect for animals they didn't before. The story line was all i could have ever wished for, but even for those of you who are not interested in animals or war i urge you to watch this the acting the method it was filmed in absolutely perfection. The movie does not drag nor does it rush it gives you a little bit of every part of the human condition.<br /><br />I dedicate this to my dog Kitana because if she had a voice this is what she would say.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game had me hooked instantly, it's very addictive.  The only negative is that I do have responsibilities you know! jk Great game.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is one show I neglected after the first season. I am glad that I have the time to catch up and never disappointed.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I don't think I've ever given a book a 5-star rating. I knew nothing about this book or author before I started reading it. I thought it was going to be chick lit...a bit of fluff...\\"a good beach read\\", as one critic said.  After a few chapters, I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of the novel. The three main characters are well-developed, and as their lives intersect, there comes a sense of urgency. One just knows that a bombshell will be dropped!  I had to slow down and let the main plot and the sub plots unfold.  Now I'm looking forward to reading other works by Ms. Moriarty.
B008JFUNNM|5.0|Tom Hanks acting is what made this film a 5/5 film. It was a 4/5 film until the last 10 minutes and the BOOM...it turned into 5/5 because of Tom's acting.
B00E4W40C4|5.0|Don't let most of the negative reviews from the people on here ruing your chance on missing out what has to be one of THE best X-Men related films we've had in a while. Although The Wolverine may have it's questionable moments in regards to the timeline of previous X-Men movies you can tell that Fox's main intentions were making an actual &#34;REAL&#34; Wolverine movie that most fans would be pleased with rather than the shameful &#34;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&#34;.<br /><br />As some people may have mentioned above there a very emotional and heartfelt moments within the film and you really get a sense of feeling just how far Logan is willing to go for those of who he loves dearly. To not spoil a few surprises within the film I must say that the film ends with Logan being a totally changed person.<br /><br />This film and &#34;Man of Steel&#34; were two of the best CBM we received this summer.<br /><br />For those who consistently bash Fox's potential of resurrecting their astonishing X-Men franchise are very upset tdue to the fact that the X-Men and Fantastic Four's movie rights aren't directly under Kevin Fiege (Marvel's Phase 1 films) hands.<br /><br />-X-Men: Days of Future Past<br />-X-Force<br />-Deadpool (TBA)<br />-Solo Magneto Movie (TBA)<br />-Possible sequel to Days of Future Past (TBA)<br /><br />Fox is improving with their quality of films each year and The Wolverine is most certainly a huge part of this great quality. Plus the uncut version contains more blood and so many scenes that couldn't make it into the film so with that being said BUY THIS!!!!
B009I2UH2W|4.0|I have owned several Griffin car chargers and have never been disappointed. This charger is no exception.  After one month of use I have not had any issues with this cable. I do not use a case with my phone so I cannot judge if the connector would have any issues fitting inside a case or bumper.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Wonderful game. Provides enough challenge but not frustratingly challenging in that I can't even get close to solving the level.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I was worried this would be one of those demo games that let you play for a half hour then demand money but it is actually a fun search and find. It's often difficult enough to be frustrating but not enough that you want to quit. I'd recommend it for those who don't mind the type of game where you look at the same picture over and over.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Better then the first book, with more plot and character development.  Still erotic (and if you embarrass easily, steer clear!), but now the element we girls always hope for---love---has arrived, and not just for Anastasia either, but for Christian Gray as well.  Ana is learning more than she ever knew, including learning to believe in her own self worth.  Quite a story!
1405910275|5.0|I loved it, but I had already read it. I can't wait for the next installment. It is a great series
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Do NOT download this app unless you want to be hooked.  It's very addicting, but fun and challenging.  Good luck crushers!!
B001BANK32|5.0|Everything I have ever read by him as always kept me on the edge of m seat, and this story is no different. If you've seen the movie and said to yourself you have no need to read this because I saw the movie and it had Jack Nicholson.....you are dead wrong! This story has so much suspense and buildup you have to read it! And besides the movie is completely different and the movie has an alternate ending........read this book and sees how the shining was meant to be !
B00G32OER4|5.0|Loved it!!! Not only was it spooky because it was true, but the entire movie was very extrem well written!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Very well directed and acted with solid storyline.  With so many superheroes in this film you would expect the story to lean more to one than another but this movie does a nice spreading attention and does not over sell the special effects.  There are a few typical cliche's but this is negligable given the great story telling.  A great movie!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Great insight on the 2nd world war & amazing storie. Cant wait to read the 3rd book. Love all Follett books.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|Very rightly, other folks have advised that WWZ is NOT a straight adaptation of Max Brooks' entertaining 'hisorty' of the zombie war. I prefer to describe the film as \\"inspired by the book of the same name.\\" We are dropped into the home life of Brad Pitt & Merielle Enos adn their two young daughters with no explanation or context. Just what we can pick up from the TV and radio chatter heard in the background. Very, very quickly, everything goes--as a friend from the UK likes to say--pear-shaped. Again, without warning or explanation. This is the film's chief virtue. For as long as possible, director Marc Forster keeps his audience off-balance...and frightened. This are not the zombies of George Romero or Robert Kirkman. This is a worldwide pandemic that is moving far too fast. As Pitt's character, Gerry Lane, takes his worldwide investigation (as a UN consultant) to Israel, the story starts to falter. An attack is instigated for the seemingly sole reason of getting Gerry OUT of Israel and into an airplane and onto his final stop. This attack is completely aviodable. By this point in the film, what attracts the infected to the healthy (loud noise and activity) is well-known. Yet, a celebration (amplified with HUGE speakers!!) is allowed to occur NEAR the giant wall built to keep the undead out. GUESS what happens?!? Once on the plane, we are treated to one more thrilling fright before arriving in Wales for this film's resolution. It is well-known that the ending was reshot and delayed release of the film. It is the weakest section of the picture. Pitt's voice-over narration as the film concludes leaves the door open for a sequel. As WWZ turned out to be a financial success, the sequel is possible. I can't see it being more than a 'bug hunt' (sorry, Pvt. Hudson). Certainly a different kind of action film. I watched WWZ alone and then again with my wife and a third time with a friend. It was fun to watch the shock of others and I wasn't bored. The holes become obvious,though. The BD looked and sounded great on my 57\\" DLP screen and 7.2 surround system. I'm happy with the purchase.

B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Overall, how could it not be an improvement over the original, my only fleeting desire would have been to have events occur over a broader landscape, immersing me in the time and place with a more visceral experience, the lone location made it feel like it was just another level in a video game without personal input via a controller.  Once again, Karl Urban, the legend grows.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Its super fun! Its exactly like the song, and the game us to prevent the munchkins from not dying in dumb ways.<br />The only thing is, you cant help the one munchkin<br />that flies the plane live. Because you have to blow to help fly the plane, and the kindle doesn't have a microphone. But other wise l great game! 5 stars for me :)

B004L03B3S|4.0|I found this to be great love story.  I had thought about buying this movvie for months, but found the idea of a relationship between two loving brothers that goes beyond a platonic level to be rather disturbing.  I've now viewed it three times and I found the carnal scenes to have been done tastefully.  The reality of the facct that they were really not brothers, but actors sort of eased my sensibility about the &#34;almost sex &#34; scenes.  The extraordinary good looks the two main characters helped this really good movie.  I strongly recommend this movie to those who are or, who might have been apprehensive about watching this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game because  my mother got me hooked and then I heard that they make 6 million dollars a day.
B00F30S0Y0|1.0|this album is very weak compared to previous work done by this group. It is very sub par to their previous albums and what they are capable of doing
B007D15N1K|3.0|I think that this book is rather too long and turgid for me.  I loved the plot and the pathos of the touching romance between too very straight laced victorian people,but did not like the long drawn out victorian poetry. I am afraid I skipped a lot but loved the fairy tale about the glass coffin and the Fairy Melusina who I believe is in the history of the War of the Roses as a descendent of Lady Rivers.<br /><br />AS Byatt is a truly great writer but I do not like this book very much as I love romances I thought I would give it a try, I should have known that Victorian era is not my favourite because of the very strict moral tones and the judgemental way of thinking.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I've enjoyed all the books written by these two authors.  This was no exception; I had a very hard time putting it down, reading it even while I was cooking or anytime I could sneak in a page or two.  I highly recommend it if you need a book to get lost in, it keeps you thinking until the very end!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Loved the parallel nature if this novel. Wonderful historical perspective on the orphan trains, and great interaction and empathy between the two main characters. Interesting depth of personalities.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|Wonderful story about finding yourself and love!!!  Great story line about the difficulties of coming out.  I really enjoyed how Payton and Kendall's relationship came full circle.
0740748475|5.0|a fantastic complete collection in a stunning casing. this collection will last for years and years. Bill Watterson will make us chuckle for years to come
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Its a good read, lite, i did enjoy it a lot and will recomend to read to other friends that whant something lite and fun to read
B00005AWMF|5.0|Who doesn't love Sade's music and soulful sounds. She will bring out emotions and memories and all good things- enough said.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Like the first one better than the others, but is always nice to finish a story, just that i did not liked something, but its was good
0767903862|4.0|It's hard for me to get past that every bug and reptile in Australia is poisonous. Or maybe that was just a dream after reading this book. True to form, Bill is hilarious. He provides the nitty-gritty on everything -- as if you were right there with him -- and adds humor. I never really wanted to travel to Australia and this book doesn't change my mind. The long distances between places -- with very little scenic interests in-between -- probably add to that lack of desire. But Bill's descriptions make you think you had visited at some previous point in your life. Great read!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Not going to win any Pulitzer Prize, but LOVE it. Love John Grisham's books. This does not disappoint. Loved catching up with Jake and crew.
B00127RAJY|5.0|A friend suggested this DVD and I can't tell you how great it is. It's tough! But I got my 6-pack abs pack within a short time -- not 30 days, more like 90 -- but I really gained an appreciation for Jillian. She is amazing. She's funny, she's encouraging, and she's on your back constantly, as if she were right there with you. I liked this DVD so much that I bought the Body Revolution and then Ripped in 30 and her Yoga Meltdown. Awesome! I highly recommend this DVD to getcha goin' on the path to fitness.
B0034JKZ8G|5.0|I love this movie. It's become one of my favorite Disney movies. Everyone should add it to their Disney collections.
B00024I31C|5.0|If there is one musician , worth meeting in person , it would have been JJ cale.<br />His music live is so different in character compared to his studio work.<br />He lived so near form where I have moved recently .... and yet missed the chance to meet him in person that I regret very much.<br /><br />His lyrics , over the years , changed in theme  but the simplicity and directness is very striking ....<br />His gentle touch of the guitar , is unique.  But I think he saw himself more of a songwriter than a guitar player.<br />This album reminds me of Dire Straits so much.<br /><br />He loved animals it seems.  ( His Dog named &#34;Blue&#34;)<br />RIP JJ Cale , we will miss you very much... ( How I wish now that I have seen you in person at leasst once)
8866135909|5.0|The spaces are a little small but other than that, I love this planner. Great quality and easy to keep organized. Would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a million things to schedule.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The best modern rendition of the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, possibly my favorite portrayal of a villain too in a TV series.
B00FFVB2DI|5.0|We cut ties with satellite/cable providers last year and have turned to a combination of Netflix streaming,  HULU Plus and buying our favorite shows on Amazon.  This works exceptionally well for us as purchasing the shows on Amazon is like having an unlimited DVR that you can watch from any internet connected device!<br /><br />Modern Family is one of those shows, at least at our house, that we can watch together and everyone enjoys themselves.  There is enough going on to keep the kids entertained (age 10) and there is a lot of humor geared towards adult viewers.  And anyone with kids knows, finding shows like that is a real plus.  That said, there are usually one or two episodes in each season that we don't let the kids watch due to more adult themes, but all in all it's a pretty safe bet.  And don't even get me started about the pleasure of watching TV without commercials!<br /><br />If you are looking for a great family comedy to curl up on the couch with, absolutely check out Modern Family.
B000000XB9|5.0|Classic.  Every song is instantly recognizeable.... You really cant go wrong with this CD.  A great introduction.  Love that swampy sound.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I love the tracking feature. I constantly misplace my phone and it helps me locate it every time. I haven't found anything malicious yet and I hope that the AV feature keeps my phone nice and clean. I haven't had any viruses on my phone or tablets to my knowledge.<br /><br />It keeps track of my battery use for me, which is nice and convenient. I also like that it doesn't seem to take up any more resources than before I started using it. I highly recommend this app.
B00A285OOW|3.0|Certainly not her best work..or maybe this wasn't the most interesting of subjects to have written about - First book of hers that disappointed me.

B00F8H0LM2|2.0|I love Angry Birds and wished this app would have worked. The only thing that worked on this game was the sound.  I will change this review if I can ever get it to work.
B0037TPMOA|5.0|Don't normally read Stephen King or 'Horror', but read this on a whim and it was brilliant and absorbing. Amazing how a book can create such atmosphere and tension.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|My friends could not stop laughing at this movie. It was a great thing to see then enjoying it, even though I had seen it before.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It's good but not great.  Still waiting for Grisham to write something that compares to his first novels; hopefully, Sycamore Row.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was good. I liked the first book better. I'm still looking forward to the movie and it was interesting enough to make me want to read the last book.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I admit that I like a happy ending.  I felt nothing but depressed at the end of this.  I really wish had done something more with the time I spent reading this trilogy because I could have been just as depressed watching a war documentary and learned actual history.  I was IN LOVE with the 1st 2 books and was very excited for Allegiant but now feel duped
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I would love to say I Love it, but it's driving me crazy. . .a good crazy I guess, since I keep playing!!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I was keen to read this New York Times best seller, and finally downloaded it from Amazon. It started well but towards the end the author does not seem to have the heart to make it a crime thriller. The writing just meanders and at the end the reader is left wondering what happened.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Pros:<br />pretty accurate for a mechanical watch, handsome design, exotic strap, very good overall quality, nice display box for the price and very good price.<br />cons:<br />relative small size 37 mm, movement made in Malaysia instead of Japan.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|After seeing part of this movie on cable, I was intrigued enough to buy it from Amazon for my Kindle. I was skeptical because all I normally read is Sci-Fi fantasy. This story was pretty good. It kept the suspense up enough to keep me reading and reading and reading even when I knew it was way past my bed time. I didn't think I would ever find another story that could so easily take me to another reality. This story was very believeable. The characters were so life like that I found myself starting to turn the pages early to see what happened next. I would recommend this book to anyone. Great job Ms. Collins.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this device.  It's allowed me to get rid of my cable subscription completely as I can now quickly stream anything from my laptop browser to my tv wirelessly.<br /><br />I wish it worked with gamepass.nfl.com, and that's the only thing that hasn't worked well.
B005PK57NU|5.0|There is more tension this season and it is great! Another season of interesting cases, I enjoy the recurring guest characters.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Now Makes you think. Works the cobwebs from the brain. Easy to do.engaging. not hard. Easier. Than writing review.get it.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Rarely do I read a book and find myself stopping along the way just to think about just how good the book is  that  I am reading but this was that kind of a book. As soon as I was done all I wanted to do was tell everyone I knew to go read it. It deserved every award it received this year. Bravo!
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|Like all of Gary's books, it's a fantastic read! Thanks Gary for your openness regarding private stuff, that's great help for everybody.<br />And of course, thanks to Pursah and Arten!
B004XQO90E|5.0|Source Code is truly a great science fiction movie that everyone can enjoy. This film has it all fast trains, explosions and time travel. There are some good special features with a physics who explains the science of the movie. For me this movie is a &#34;buy&#34;.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|I liked this book and enjoyed it. But I did find it very wordy. I did not wish so much so much information as I did a story.<br />I wished the characters were more real. I can't explain exactly what is was about this book that left me feeling blank. I sympathized only with<br />Roger. Lol. Sorry, just not crazy about the book.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|Does not compare to THE SHINING... Childish! Not Scary.. Stupid plot.. Maybe it is time for King to hang it up!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Starts out fun.  As you progress gets frustrating when you can't get past a certain level.  Find it frustrating especially if you don't want to purchase extra lives etc.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I held out while all my friends played. I finally gave in.... now I am slmost caught up if that says anything.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you've had doubts about NDEs and the existance of an afterlife, this book, from a scientific approach might just convince you otherwise - or at least question your purpose and place in the life chain.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The plot is way too predictable and the characters are without substance.<br /><br />Need a lot of editorial work - Currently the language is at high school level.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I am totally amazed at the rigorous training that our Navy SEALs are put through to become the best of the best. Luttrell's account is absolutely engaging and inspiring.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Nice game with some good art, elegant interface, and non-intrusive about buying goodies or online play.  The game is very easy to learn.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I truly enjoyed all THREE books in this series and I am anxiously awaiting more novels from E L James!!!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I have been waiting and waiting and waiting...clutching my 'Parp' mug with anticipation for this book to come out. Its hilarious, painfully relate-able and the dogs are perfect. The drawings alone make me laugh out loud, and the writing is fantastic. Don't miss out!!!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|It's Wuthering Heights what else is there to say?  It is a good book I really enjoyed it.  It is pretty dark but would read again.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|It was and exciting to build .... Like all LEGO toys. We have never been disappointed with LEGO. Neither will you.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|This season is as good or better than the previous two.  Shucks, it might be the best one so far.
B00C9VFWP6|5.0|These guys had a lot to live up to with this album considering the monster that is \\"Alive In Athens\\", which in many a metalheads opinion is one of the greatest greatest live albums ever.  Is this as good?  Not quite, but it is surprisingly close and worthy of 5 stars.  Stu is great, flawlessly singing all eras of the bands' material.  He doesn't exactly have the wittiest stage banter, but that is just nitpicking because it is really about the music.  The song selection is great, spanning Iced Earth's entire career.  The highlight here has got to be \\"Dante's Inferno\\", in its' full 18-minute glory.  The new songs sound great too.  All Iced Earth fans, new and old, need to get this!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It's not immediately obvious how to set it.<br />The volume is too low for sound sleepers. I slept through it.
B00DQZQPNM|3.0|The cover is nice and does what it was designed to do. A pocket/pouch/sleeve for holding a stylus would have made this item more practical and satidfying.
B004J4X32U|5.0|Clear, incisive, and practical, Siegel has captured the importance of understanding a child's brain as it relates to behavior and parenting.  The concept of  &#34;integration&#34; is huge!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It was a good book not my favorite because of the death. I don't want to ruin it for anyone. But yeah. I'm not feeling this too much. Enjoyed the read though.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase of the DVD Pride & Prejudice. I am completely satisfied with the service I have received from this seller and will be ordering from them again in the near future. They provided outstanding service and their prices were low. My mom appreciated the DVD as well she is on a big Jane Austen boost right now.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it it's fun and addicting but it would be fun to vs other players without going onto Facebook other wise cool
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  To be honest, I didn't complete the book.  I found it hard to connect with the characters.  Lacked creativity and depth.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The book was good and amazing. I am happy my sister recommend it to me. It truly is a great book
B00520R146|4.0|Grand daughter loves it. She watches it over and over many times.  God buy for my family. Thank you. Much.
B00CJKW4WQ|5.0|You would think that Apple would have made one of these a long time ago and charged twice as much. The keys feel very similar to the ones on the Apple keyboard, and it is nice that they made it longer to accommodate the LCD display, yet maintained the same angle and height from the front edge so that the keys are in the same plane as the wireless keyboard. (Well close enough anyway, the rear of the keypad is about 1/64th higher, but I'm really not that picky. Really.) You could sand down the back footpad a bit to line them up, but be careful not to sand too much, or then you'll have to sand down the keyboard's, and then you are on the slippery slope.<br />One other thing, the case is plastic not aluminum, I was curious about that when I ordered it and now I know! It's a really nice plastic though...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book in like 3day.. I feel bad because she fell in love..sometimes the sign are right in front in front of a person and don't think about how it may affect them..I can't wait to read the next two..the sex scene was great and my hubby wanted to try it and I said I would but under my condition and will try the contract....
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|i am very interested in a 46-47inch smart tv google lg.Waiting on finding a good deal during the holiday sales at best buy in my area.
0385351399|4.0|A literary work like \\"1984,\\" this book is not.  No matter.  The reader immediately gets on the ride of Egger's good writing and with a surrender much like his protagonist, Mae, follows where the author is going. I was glued to the book for two days until I finished and am still thinking about the many questions it raises.<br /><br />True, you won't find fine tuned characterizations and nuanced plots.  Eggers works in brush strokes in showing you how the cult like promises and idealism of technology can work a person over.  After  Mae, the main character, is busted in a humiliating moment for stealing a kayak, she agrees to surrender her privacy to better live up to the ideals of the Circle (and save her job and her father's health insurance)  It raises the question of how deep transparency really goes.<br /><br />It's hysterical to read criticism of the book coming from -- usually tech dependent -- people, that the book somehow lacks legitimacy because Eggers claims to have done no \\"research.\\"  Or that he doesn't know the Internet (Wired magazine).  This is nonsense.  This book is a satire.  This is a big picture book.  Not a series of lines from a Twitter feed.  Some readinc comprehension is required to appreciate the book, and introspection required for anyone who uses the Internet. Good book.  Will make many people nervous.  And that's what a good writer does.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This weather app is one of the better ones I have seen. It is easy to use and is very accurate.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|The flow is slow, to much tedious, descriptive dialog, and not enough explaination of how, and why some characters are envolved in this caper( such as the French lover, Gary, and Browne).
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Bought this lav mic when my video editor complained about room echo in my shotgun mic work. The ATR-3350 gets away from the echo problem (far cheaper and easier than echo-proofing my office), but replaces it with a low-volume hissing noise. Well, it's good enough for my editor so it's good enough for me. And I really can't complain about the performance-to-price ratio here. It's a steal, really.<br /><br />All that being said, I'm thinking of upgrading to a professional-grade lav mic one of these days. Noise canceling, a wireless connection pack, that sort of thing. In the meantime, the ATR-3350 serves me well enough.
0425188809|5.0|This is the only book that ever made my husband want to leave a light on.  I liked the dog.  If I could write like just one horrow writer, it would be Dean Koontz.  Read this if you love dogs, and don't mind being scared.&#60;smile&#62;
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The good:<br />* Simple to set up.<br />* Great picture quality, full 1080p.<br />* Easy to operate with your favorite Apple or Android gadgets.<br />* Supports Netflix, YouTube, Hulu Plus, and now Pandora. More to come, I'm sure.<br />* For unsupported media streams, anything that plays in a Chrome browser (on a reasonably beefy system; my 4-year-old laptop can't handle this) will also work on Chromecast. Just takes some extra fiddling.<br /><br />The bad:<br />* My aging plasma TV doesn't support HDMI 1.4, so the screen doesn't turn on to the Chromecast channel when I start watching stuff. Where's my TV remote? Annoying.<br />* No separate audio outputs, so my surround speaker system goes unused until I splurge on an HDMI audio breakout connector that costs more than the Chromecast itself. Yeah, that won't happen. A darn shame.<br /><br />The ugly:<br />* The silly thing never turns off. Turning off the video signal when the device isn't in use would let my screen behave corretly when the video starts.<br />* Buggy, buggy, buggy. Most notably, YouTube videos often require me to hit \\"play\\" several times before the video starts. Waiting isn't good enough.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am happy to say, that unlike most trilogies in the dystopian genre, this one actual brings the reader to an respectful and realistic closure.  Sure, you'll wish there was more, but you will be satisfied with the end
B008JFUO36|4.0|The movie &#34;Oblivion&#34; is a great movie to relax with if you are a post-apocalyptic science fiction fan. It starts out appearing as a story about a man/woman salvage team trying to gather resources from the destroyed earth to take with them to their satellite home where the last of humanity lives and then going to one of Jupiter's moons to restart civilization.  However appearances can be deceiving and it turns out that the world is not what it seems and they are not what they seem.  As the story goes on many secrets are revealed as to how the world was devastated and how Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) was involved in it.  I enjoyed the special effects and the action but one thing  made the film less enjoyable to me.  It was obvious at a certain point how the plot was going to resolve itself and the required happy ending was not that satisfying.  Still, it's a good flick and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this film genre.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Bought the book which is the 3rd in the trilogy. Be sure to read the first two before reading this one.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|I'm a big fan of Max Martini so of course I liked the movie. Action and special effects were good. The plot was predictable but then most action movies are. And to be honest I don't watch these types of movies for deep plot lines and strong character development. I rented it through Amazon to see if it was worth buying for my teenage son for Christmas. It was, and I will, and he'll have it in his stocking. Charlie Humman did a good job. I was afraid I'd just see a Sons of Anarchy character, and there were brief flashes of that, mainly when he was walking, but other than that I didn't feel like I had a Sons character trespassing in this action film. So all in all, I'd watch it again. I didn't give it five stars simply because, well, it was a bit predictable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Bought the book because of it being a trilogy. So glad I did.Loved the book. Hard to put it down. Waiting for the movie.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I loved this sequel that takes you through the 30's, 40's and 50's and life during WWII.  He did his research and it was interesting to read about the characters from Russia, Germany, England, US and their visit to Pearl Harbor on that fateful day. This is my 4th Follett book and one thing I love about his books is how he can take so many characters and weave them in and out of the story lines, and amazing characters they are. Now I'm really looking forward to the next one.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This the basic solitaire game but very playable. Addictive. Bought for my tablet which did not have games preloaded. Easy download.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the Best Book I have EVER read.  I hated to see the book end.  It brought so many memories of the  book Time To Kill.  That one was really greatly written.  Hope there will be a sequel to Sycamore  Row.  John Grisham is a wonderful author.  Wish more authors wrote this well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have this on every mobile device &amp; every tablet in our house! We all are absolutely addicted to this game!
B00CL0J99K|4.0|At times a bit slow, and less light-hearted, but still has that overall Iron Man feel...great tech toys and effects.
0399230033|5.0|When I first bought this book I was somewhat disappointed by the illustrations.  Maybe I was expecting something more elaborate. However, from the first time we read this to our son at about 6 months, he was enraptured by it.  There's something about the way the story flows that he was able to understand it and focus on it, even at a younger age.  He smiles at the same point every time we read it, which is when the animals are caught in the room and the lady's eyes are open on one dark page, followed by the next page when she turns the light on.  For some reason he understands something funny and mischievous is happening there.  The fact that this book can keep his attention despite having so few words is a testament to its effectiveness as a great children's story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|what can i say about a game that is totally awesome i can't seem to put it down we play it all the time
B002APU580|5.0|This movie is fabulous.  I have seen many film versions of the book.  Beginning with the old Hollywood version with Sir Lawrence Olivier.  That movie was glossed and everything was pretty and shiny.  This movie was realistic...at least to me....I did not live during that time but i imagine it wasn't all shiny and glossy...I imagine it was much like this film.  It was so great Keira Knightly's Elizabeth was full of passion and life.  Matthew McFadden is not the typically handsome Darcy you would expect...he was raw and sensuous and his maleness just popped off the screen.  Their obvious attraction to one another is tactile and fertile with energy.<br /><br />I have watched this film dozens of times.  A must see.
B00FX8EY60|2.0|After hearing &#34;Roar&#34;  I thought I would purchase my second KP album, what a disappointment.  The single is the highlight.
B00486070K|5.0|It worked in every Macbook/Macbook Pro I plugged it into.<br /><br />Very solid construction.<br />No drivers to hunt down, you just plug this into your USB port on the Mac and it works.<br />Appears to work in all modern Macbook/Macbook Pro.<br /><br />I did not test any MacBook Air's.
0143124544|5.0|I was captivated by this book, so much so that I kept finding excuses to go back and read &#34;just one more chapter&#34; - repeatedly. And then, as I came close to the end, I wanted to stop reading it because I wanted to make my own ending. Absolutely great read - highly recommended!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|When I was working for a company called Westwood Studios out in Las Vegas a game came in that had us all crowded into a room. The game was Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and we were all shocked how great the game was. Now later on I had wondered why haven't these classics been re-released for the Playstation 3? Someone had heard the prayers of Metal Gear fans worldwide as they have released the Metal Gear Solid Collection for the Playstation 3. But are some of these classics worth revisiting or should you look forward to the future Metal Gear titles?<br /><br />The first thing I want to remark on this game is that it is massive. This game is released on two blu ray discs and covers eight games and has two videos included as well. The games go as far back as the original Metal gear and Metal gear 2 (which was oriinally dgeveloped for the MSX and ported to consoles worldwide). But it also includes all of the Metal Gear Solid games from the original all the way up to Metal Gear Solid 4. This is a deal in and of itself because if you were to purchase all these games separately it would cost you over $200 if not more.<br /><br />There are also two videos that are included which are motion comic adaptations of the Metal Gear graphic novels. These are pretty awesome in and of itself but the crowning achievement of this legacy collection has to be the booklet that is included with this game. This 100 page booklet has tons of promotional items and brochures that are related to the MGS franchise.  Is this a complete set of all the games that were released by Konami? No. But it is pretty close as it is only missing two games (twin snakes and portable ops). And these game are all remastered for HD so they will look absolutely gorgeous on your television.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the MGS Series you need to pick this up as you will now have almost every MGS game on the PS3. This package not only has some of the best games but sports over 60+ hours of gameplay!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Really, just....AUGH.  The first two books were so much fun, with action, and decent character development and to say this last one was disappointing is an understatement.  Others have posted in detail, so I'll spare you the prose
B004R8HPZY|4.0|This is a wonderful album to escape with.  Steep some tea or brew some coffee, relax and imagine yourself among fans and family alike who want to bob and sway to melodic guitar rifts.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Enjoy the game.  As the levels progress it becomes harder to progress - the point I know but also a ploy to bug friends and spend money - both which I've done, so I guess it works!  lol
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I really enjoy this watch.  The style is exactly what I wanted; a red tipped sweeping second hand, ticks across the outer face, an arrow at noon, hours within the minutes, luminous hands and a matte finish on the bezel.  The crown is tucked away and does not dig into the wrist of those of us who wear it near the hand, which is a major plus in my book.<br /><br />The con to this watch is the strap, but it is easily replaceable (see my review of the JP Leatherworks strap I just put on it).  A new strap really sets this watch apart.  The original has a thick, coarse nylon texture and does begin to fray at the edges shortly after some use.  The links to hold the strap are also a bit bulky compared to the profile of the watch itself and does not fit it properly as a day-to-day user.  A good NATO style strap or thin leather strap does this thing wonders.<br /><br />The only other con I have is that mine seems to run about 30 seconds fast per day.  At this pricepoint I really can't complain too much, but I was hoping to receive a model that was closer to the 10-15 second range I've been reading about.  An adjustment every few days doesn't bother me too much in the end.  I'd highly recommend this watch (or it's other colored brothers).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am hooked.  Got me by the upper lip.  Thanks for the free download amazon. Great game for the kindle.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|I'm not into long reviews, but this CD doesn't feel like one long song, each song brings a unique dynamic and content to the whole album. From the hard start, to the rolling buildup in Lover, to the ending that leaves you on a high long after it has stopped playing. Excellent work.
B009TO99TG|5.0|If you like Cold Play this 4 catalogue set has all the hits. a must for every Cold Play fan.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|I loved this movie! It's difficult to peg it in a slot, but for us it was &#34;just&#34; a terrific all-American story. There's a bit of Huck Finn in here, a whole bunch on the cost of love and the loss of a way of life that is disappearing forever, mystery, and a great pay off for a set-up early in the flick.<br /><br />This is an indie film done on a low budget, but look at the talent it drew. Some of the hottest and highest paid actors in Hollywood. They don't go low budget if the story isn't worth it. This story is. And good grief! Matthew McConaughey spends most of the movie trying to keep his shirt ON and I still loved it.<br /><br />It's a deeply satisfying movie for those who enjoy a film that touches the heart and soul without the need of all the Hollywood plot points hit on cue (no cats are saved here). If you're looking for spectacle, this isn't the film for you. If everything has to be pretty, watch something else. But if you love a deeply satisfying story and can identify with adventure on a wide open river of opportunity and new beginnings, don't hesitate.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Meryl Streep certainly deserved her Best Actress Oscar for her characterization of PM Thatcher.  I certainly feel as if I am watching the real Maggie herself from youth to death.  Some found the film's dwelling on her decline distateful; but I thought it a fine approach in summing the peaks and twists of her career into its final descent.  Alexandra Roach as young Margaret Roberts/Thatcher also gave a strong performance which has gone unappreciated - as to be expected - under all the Streep hype.<br /><br />Aesthetics aside, the film is a meandering snapshot of a woman you either loved or hated.  The writers and producer are thus caught in this ambivalence: to respect the woman, and her commitment to her ideals, while apparently not caring for the specifics of said ideals.  However, in my view there really wasn't much appeal in the woman herself.  An envying, ambitious \\"upstart\\" who predictably aged into a bitter harridan as she settled into power, the real Maggie seemed haunted by her common past as she envied the \\"successful\\"; bitterly resenting the fellow commoners who \\"held her back\\" from her (and therefore Britain's) \\"greatness.\\"  Smashing the British trade unions so Brit Yuppies could squander millions in drunken partying was her lasting and quite unenviable legacy.<br /><br />Laying waste to British democracy was, in the end, not enough to bring her downfall.  Only when she turned on her own Tory Politburo did the British Establishment finally, at long last, cry Enough.  The lesson of Thatcher's career is to beware the ambitious politicians who are compared - or compare themselves - to ferrous matter: A Man of Steel (Stalin) or an Iron Lady do not create structures of state and society without much waste and carnage in their wake.  The film makers are ambivalent about her legacy because she did, after all, \\"stand for the West.\\"  It would be an ironic hoot to see a Russian film on the decline of Stalin, his mind wandering in his dacha to his own glory days of bank robbing, party purging, and war winning.bank robbing, party purging, and war winning.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I know, film purists will say there are holes in the structure, but we enjoyed watching this film. It wasn't a high tech thriller that we expected. It was better. This is magic put to great use. Original, fun, full of suspense, and a good night at the movies without leaving home.
B00E03ULJS|5.0|Krewella's debut album did meet my expectations!! I first heard them whe. I foubd out they were doing a show in pompano beach, fl and I felt in love with their music. Start to end the album is one hell of a ride;and like the last song goes<br />&#34;This is not the end&#34;<br />#Krewlife
B001BANK32|5.0|When I was young and dumb, I thought King's work was childish. I'm a grown-up now and appreciate reading through the work of this master. He knows how to pace and plant a line here and there that messes with your head, and the visual quality of his writing makes it easy to get lost in the world he creates. King keeps you guessing on many different levels, while somehow avoiding confusion. The terror builds slowly, and when it hits, it hits hard. I slept with the lights on.<br /><br />This is one of the few books at this price point that doesn't tick me off. For writing this good in a big, juicy book that lets me wander through the world created, I'll go the extra money for the ride.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book for anybody who enjoys storytelling that's through the roof, likes being taken places they'd rather not go, and those with the focus to wander through a big book and enjoys getting lost in the grip of a master.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This is my second set of Sony MDR7506 headphones. The first set lasted over 10 years, but were lost/stolen. They're really comfortable and have great sound quality. I use them with my laptop, since the speakers have no bass and sound terrible.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If you loved Time to Kill, you will love this book!<br />Excellent pace, fascinating issues, and a great setting.  The ending is classic Grisham!
B003G93YQE|5.0|I totally enjoyed the words and emotions expressed by these men. I guess in todays world with texting and tweeting it has become a lost art form, but even in an email you can express the same longing and desires of these great men for the women (or men) whom they love. It is time we learn from the past, express your heart felt emotions to those you love, there is a great power in the written words.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I love Paul McCartney's music. This album was a great diversion from his normal style. I love jazz and was surprised when I heard &#34;Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive&#34; how much I loved McCartney's version! The other amazing, talented musicians backing McCartney make the whole album feel extremely polished and tight. Overall, if you love Paul McCartney's voice, this is an album I'd highly recommend. If you are looking for his typical style, this isn't it! This is a jazzy, mellow album.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|The pictures here are of the US Blu-ray release. I received the UK Blu-ray release with completely different packaging and UK disks (Philosopher's Stone...). The disks are region-free, as far as I can tell, and so play fine but are NOT what I ordered.
140053271X|1.0|We bought one of these for my mother-in-law hoping to get her a piece of technology that would be enjoyable for her to use. It has been nothing but a pain. Her main thing she uses it for is reading books from the library. This requires a process that involves going through hoops, a computer, and an Adobe ID and software. Having experience with an Amazon Kindle (the very basic one) and iPads with library books, this was an absolute pain and I feel bad for my in-laws. What should be a two-five step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook. There have been several occasions where my father-in-law (who is ok with technology) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.<br /><br />I would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the Nook itself. Otherwise, it is nothing but frustrating.
1554072840|5.0|My almost-2-year-old loves this book. She runs around with it and asks me to read it to her by saying, \\"Prudence?\\" Prudence is the name of the little girl in this book.<br /><br />The book surprised me at first because it shows kids their anatomy (so you probably want to make sure to get the girl one for girls and the boy one for boys). My kids LOVE that part of the book, though, and my daughter loves to point out the \\"little hole for going poo-poo\\" in the book. She also loves the part about what the potty is for. We cheer for Prudence when she finally uses the potty, and my daughter then runs off to use her potty, too!<br /><br />This book has really made a big difference in potty training in our house. It's made it fun! Plus, it really is my daughter's favorite book now.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like the concept of the Chromecast, but Google is dragging its feet in allowing other developers to utilize the APIs. I'm glad Hulu and Netflix are there, but there is much more that I'd like to see, like Vimeo, Crunchyroll, and Spotify. Heck, even allowing casting of games would be great. Until then, I am more apt to use my Apple TV since it has more available to stream and can mirror my entire iOS device...not just &#34;approved&#34; apps.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Campy campy campy. It's a good cheesy read with a glass of wine. Just don't go in expecting to find your new favorite book.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|Great movie!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book, like all Nicholas Sparks books, keeps you guessing. The relationship between the grandma, mother and son is heartwarming.  Love has no bounds. It really is a neat story all the way to the end
B00881VLCE|5.0|got the app free and really enjoyed it so I bought the expansion pack. Now it crashes constantly. I uninstalled, reinstalled and it still nothing. I would like it to work correctly or my money returned.
B009CG91QM|5.0|Everybody knew a book was being written but we had no idea who he was or what he would write about our beloved Odessa Permian Panthers. How bad could it be anyway. Life was good. We had beaten OHS.  District Champs. State Champs. It does take a village to raise the kids who become state champs. It's not like your normal high school game. No, the big games are televised and draw 20,000 +. The community was a huge part of making these young men who they were. Good, bad and ugly. Which is exactly what the movie brings to life. Read the book because it is a bit of our Odessa history including leading the nation in per capita murder cases in 1989. You had to be there to believe this story we thought. Welcome to a little part of our history.
B004AQR29C|4.0|Another in the line of fast paced action movies not bad as always you likely expect more just because of all the hype and advertising but overall a decent movie.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Very touching film.  Really had some very funny moments and a huge/important underlying message that is timeless.  Lest we forget the autrocities of the day + the perpetraitors. This film is excellant. Highly recommended.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I love it!! What an awesome cd!! So soothing and special!! I'm so glad I finally bought it. I sing these songs to my baby.

B005GG0MIS|4.0|This book paints a more human picture of presidents and how valuable ex-presidents can be in their day to day job.
1451666179|5.0|I have been reading Allie's blog forever, and I especially love her illustrations. But she's been absent writing this book, so I haven't had my Hyperbole and a Half fix for a long time. I preordered this book and it's all Allie. Her illustrations are hysterical, and the text is awesome too. She tells stories about her childhood and about her dogs-just everyday events-but makes them so amusing. It cheers me up to read them. I highly recommend this book. If you're a fan, you'll be in heaven, and if you're not, you'll become one.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Having read this book for the second time now...all I can say is pick up any of Diana's books concerning Jamie and Claire and prepare to to be swept away into an amazing world.
B00280LYHS|4.0|This was a satisfying ending to the series. Riordan uses a lot of humor and drama in his books, with plenty of surprises. He knows his Olympian history, and includes it in the books, making them educational as well as entertaining. There are deaths that occur in the books, but they're well imagined, and things turn out well.
B0084TWN9K|2.0|Well, I did not like Alice Munro before she won the Nobel prize for Literature (Short Stories).  However, after she won the prize I thought I should read more from Ms. Munro.  After reading this book, &#34;Dear Life: Stories&#34;, I am again offended by the consistently shallow, weak, and mentally unstable women in her stories.  To be fair, Ms. Munro does an outstanding job creating an ambiance; it is so visceral that you can feel the cold, the privation, the rocking trains.  Also, the stories are clever, interesting and unique.  But, I cannot relate to any of the main characters in her stories.  In fact, the women rather repel me.  If she only had an occasionally mentally ill protagonist I would feel differently; what I don't like is that all her protagonists are subtly disturbed.
B00CFA222M|4.0|My husband & I watched this. We were pleasantly surprised by how well this was done. The acting was good for a revamped fairy tale. The special effects were good. The story was well done also. Nothing kids can't handle.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Bought this as a package with the following:<br /><br />RAM Composite Short Double Socket Arm for 1&#34;&#34; Ball Bases<br />RAM Cradle Holder - Universal X-Grip(TM) Cell Phone Holder with 1&#34;&#34; Ball<br /><br />This fits very well onto my handle bar for my hybrid bike. Extremely durable and doesn't shift or anything like that, even on gravel paths. Recommended to anyone looking to add a mount system to their bike!
B004HW7JI8|4.0|I enjoyed watching this show. I do think if you are concerned about exposure to stories of pre marital sexual relationships or teacher/student affairs you need to keep this show away from your kids. I definitely do not condone the story line of Aria & Mr Fitz's on going affair. I do hope this is the end of that story line. I believe Mr Fitz's character should have shown some & ended the relationship as soon as he found out Aria's true age. Other than that, it has alot of interesting twists and turns. Older teens can understand the ins & outs. Does teach that deception has a price and can be worse than dealing with the consequences of telling the truth immediately. Lies always get worse with age.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game has amazing graphics and storyline , it really pull s you in! In case you get stuck, there are plenty of clues to help you out. Maybe A little too much help, but you can choose to  ignore it. Great fun and highly addictive!
B009DA74ES|5.0|I have to admit, even with the foul language and over the top sex, I love this series. Not for kids, by any mean. I just enjoy the writing and the twisted situations Duchovny's character is always getting into. I love that Becca's new love interest is almost a carbon copy of her dad. Such an interesting show.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can read this book over and over. This book was able to transport me to a place I never imagined. I am so grateful to the author.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Typical Tarrentino. Very violent and bloody but he definitely gets the best out of his actors and script. Not for kids, of course. I have never seen a Tarrentino movie that kids should see. I loved the story. Foxx was excellent and DiCaprio was his usual great self.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|Too many studies regarding habit...very little in the way of solid action plan. I believe the premise of the book is excellent, but got too caught up in the minutiae.
B00DVPN30A|5.0|This album has it all.  Amos has a voice and music legacy that leads you down a road of total mind control.  You can relax by the river, watch the leaves fall or drive the highway and wind thru the valley or mountains and listen to the words. The music can be relaxing or it can transform you into a trance of where am I? Some say its not like his other album release, No it is not!  It is done with more heart and soul and is a new album.  Listen and enjoy,  The first take might not take you where you want to be.  But by the third time listening to this disc, I guarantee you will be saying........... WOW, it really does has a transforming sound.  Sit back and enjoy another great release by Amos Lee.  My humble opinion of course.
B00640Z0RI|5.0|A fantastic book that keeps you glued to the pages with a great writing style. One of my favorite war books of all time.
B00F1CRSKM|5.0|Actual Rating: 4.5 stars<br /><br />Arcade Fire were well overdue for a critical backlash.  Even before their surprise upset Grammy nod, the band was clearly no longer an indie darling upon the release of The Suburbs, but an arena-rock band ascending to take the throne of the Next U2/Springsteen/etc.  Critics love underdogs, but they're wary of a winner.  To make matters worse, the band did some things that made them look like, well, dicks.  Crashing CMJ, turning away fans who weren't in costume from surprise shows, and masquerading as an \\"indie band\\" called (in a masterstroke of subterfuge) The Reflektors - these publicity stunts may have attracted more negative than positive attention.  So it's no surprise that Reflektor has been getting some negative notices in the press.<br /><br />It's just a shame that the critics are taking it out on one of the best albums of the year.<br /><br />Most of the early criticism around Reflektor has been that it's indulgent - all the tracks are too long, overly pretentious, and don't have the content to sustain their running time.  First, let me dismiss the pretention claim - do you like Arcade Fire?  Because if you do, you like pretentious things.  It's been in the band's DNA from the very start - they began their debut with a four-song suite! - and has only increased as time has gone on.  If anything, this is less pretentious than The Suburbs - there are no hamfisted T.S. Eliot references here.  Next, the tracks are too long.  Somehow this wasn't a complaint for LCD Soundsystem's last album, where almost every track was 8-9 minutes, but is a problem when Arcade Fire average around 6.  The release of the title track should have been a wake-up call - Reflektor is generally more dance-oriented, and the tracks run longer as a result.  But here is my most fundamental disagreement with the critics - the band absolutely has enough ideas to sustain each song.  The title track alone finds room for at least four melodies in its choruses,and this isn't including a sublime bridge featuring the Thin White Duke himself.<br /><br />Perhaps the real problem, then, is a sense that there is simply Too Much to digest here.  That's because Reflektor is not just a throwback in genre stylings, but also to the idea of the double album.  Much like the most legendary rock double albums (e.g., London Calling, Exile on Main Street, Zen Arcade) this is the band stretching out, showing off their range, letting their ideas sprawl a bit.  Going in with this in mind, the album is actually pretty easy to listen to in full.<br /><br />It helps that most of it is propulsive.  Disregarding the ambient interlude at the end of the album (more on that later) the only really beatless song is a reprise of Here Comes The Night Time - and that comes almost as a brief respite after the whirlwind of Disc 1.  After the opening disco salvo of Reflektor and We Exist, the band does dubby reggaeton (Flashbulb Eyes), overheated salsa (portions of Here Comes the Night Time) and glam rock stomp (Joan of Arc).  There's even a rock freakout thrown in for good measure (Normal Person).  Tempos are generally mid-to-high throughout, and the result is almost as exhausting as it is exhilarating.<br /><br />It's almost a good thing that Disc 2 takes it down a notch, kicking off after the reprise with the gorgeous, woozy sing-a-long of Awful Sound, part one of a sublime set of paired tracks (loosely) themed around the tale of Orpheus.  Awful Sound is something of a minor miracle in itself, a track that by any definition shouldn't work, combining as it does a Hey Jude-like chant with Latin percussion and, of all things, a synth line that seems pulled from a Boards of Canada record.  Even when the song is swallowed by roaring feedback, it's triumphant.  Its companion piece, It's Never Over, begins with an aggressive 80s Bowie-funk strut and call-and-response lyrics, but the bridge softens into something genuinely touching.<br /><br />Maybe there reallyis too much going on in this album, or at least too much to talk about - I haven't even mentioned the gorgeous ending couplet of Afterlife and Supersymmetry (semi-gratuitous ambient ending aside) or some of the more redundant tracks on the album (the mournful bounce of Porno could easily have been relegated to a B-side, and You Already Know sounds like it belongs on an earlier record rather than this one).  But again - think double album.  Excess is the point.  And so much of this is very good, and so little of it is actually gratuitous, and most importantly, none of it is problematic to the extent that it cheapens what's around it.  For the price of a single album, you're definitely getting your money's worth.  Arcade Fire are stretching and growing as artists, and the results are well worth savoring.
B00AZM7IQC|4.0|I wish they would only sell 3d movies and not other disks included, just a waste in terms of usage.. why would one need both?<br />About the rating, the quality is good, but i guess 3d tvs these days can only do so much and they are no match to theater. It does not beat the live show though..could work for kids at home
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|.the continuation of the book The Shining is just as spellbinding as the former book. Very gripping and enjoyable. Highly reccomend .
B00BGN6G4E|5.0|This is a great second album from Arven with catchy, interesting and creative songs.  The music is characteristic of their previous album, but also perhaps a bit more complex.
B000002J0B|3.0|This is one of least favorite Led Zeppelins due to a number of factors.<br /><br />1: Dancing Days is one of the most annoying songs in the Zeppelin catalog , Robert Plant almost sounds like Geddy Lee.<br /><br />2: Dyer Maker is a poor attempt to due a reggae song i've heard, who told these guys they should do reggage, they would be like telling Black Sabbath they should do a doo wop song.<br /><br />On the other hand<br /><br />'No Quarter is one of the trippest Zeppelin song, i really enjoy that song, plus The Ocean is another good song, would it have been better of they left off Dancing Days and Dyer Maker.

B00BWYFTNG|5.0|Bought this as a gift. Placed the order in May of 2013.Just received it a couple weeks ago. The product looks good and should please the Walking dead fan I bought it for. The likeness is very good and is packaged very well. One issue was the seller charged my account months ago with no explanation of why and then showed product shipped out. When contacted seller they simply stated Amazon would not let them do anything else, not sure their reasoning for that, but their advice , get my money back and no product.I said No, will wait if I have to just wanted a explanation. So now after all this time I finally got the product. Not sure if others had the same issue or not, but just in case others deal with these folks they know in case it happens to them . They fulfilled the deal and that is all that matters in the end.<br />Great Looking Figures.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got my kindle fire for a birthday present and was very disappointed that I couldn't play Candy Crush with my new kindle. So it sat in the case for about 2 months and then I received the email from amazon letting me know about the new releases and when I seen the candy crush app. I took my kindle out of the case and instantly downloaded it. But there are still a lot of apps that I can get on my phone and they are still not available on amazon yet.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It is easy to set up. It works very good. However, it needs more options.  It is the cheapest and the best that I found.
B001ILHY1I|1.0|Death Race consists of painful and unpleasant sensations, a nauseous movie for kids with a mental age of between - 8 and 12 years, obsessed with stupid video games like Twisted Death Metal and Road Smash. Only a 12 year old boy with an upper limit IQ of 10 could find this offensive, moronic, childish nonsense \\"fun.\\"<br /><br />Death Race had a lot of guns, gun eye candy, gun flames and gun blow up scenes, but nothing else. The writing was dull and the prison aspect took away from the original story. Death Race fails as sci-fi (a future world or society is not explored).<br /><br />Overall this movie just gets boring after watching the same cars drive around in a small circle over and over again with no people dying.<br /><br />I was incredibly let down by this film. This is a phenomenally unintelligent movie.

B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I have long been aware of the dangers of eating wheat and a high carb diet for 10 years. I didn't always follow the recommendations though due to the allure of those foods that are high in carbs.  I suppose I was willing to deal with the impact of the weight gained as a result.  After a year or more of what I call brain fog and downright forgetfulness I am glad to have found this book.  3 weeks into being grain free and back on a low carb/sugar diet I am feeling great. Down 12lbs and the forgetfulness and brain fog seem to be lifting.  Seeing the link to dementia as the result of poor dietary habits scares the crap out of me. I've always said that the one thing people can never take away from you is your knowledge.  Apparently that's not true.

One of the best books on the deeply personal tragedies of the individual warrior who has a duty to his country and self and the contradictions faced with one's morality. For lovers of true tales of war, this is an absolute must read.
B002XXPNXG|1.0|I watched this with my significant other last evening. Losing interest rapidly, I checked the Rotten Tomatoes reviews. Critics loved it....so much so that I think it must be impolitic for a critic to pan any of the three movies in this series.<br /><br />Well, not feeling peer pressure from the critic community, I am very comfortable telling you that this movie is horrible. It follows, in excruciatingly painstaking detail, the life and relationship trials and tribulations of two 30 something people that I for one, could absolutely care less about. Woody Allen would have been proud to have made this movie....two people walking through Paris and doing nothing but prattling on incessantly for 80 minutes. I could understand it if the characters were worth caring about but these two????. Thankfully, after 80 minutes and two aspirin, the ordeal ended.<br /><br />I guess one needs to be an uber-urban, hip, metro-sexual to get this flick... and that's definitely not me...
B0035S996U|2.0|I watched this as a suggestion of a friend.  There was basically no plot, just one gang fighting another.  Judging from the different gang costumes, I wasn't sure if the movie was being serious or campy.  I'm sure that this is one of those movies that has a cult following.  It just wasn't my thing.
B008MM9630|5.0|I absolutely love this game. You get a little farm in which you can grow mystical plants and trees, and raise animals.  There are quests (some dependent on gems, which are hard to come by without purchasing).  I love growing the plants and seeing what I get, and decorating my farm.  There's also crafting (the mailbox is a piece of crafting equipment!) and holiday quests.  This is the first casual game I've wanted to support with my money...I've played a lot over many years.<br /><br />A few downsides: I think it's hard to fully enjoy without spending money. Would take sooo long to save  gems just for expansions of your land. Also, if you spend money you still can't get all you want without pouring in even more money. Example: some quests require you to buy boxes for example. But when you do the item in the box may be a random thing instead of the one with the quest item. This means you may have to buy multiples just to get the thing you need. It's honestly insidious but if you hook enough people your game company can become quite wealthy. I think it's wrong for game companies to suck money like that.  I've spent $25 already and haven't gotten very far into the game. The advertising tactics are beautifully integrated into the game and very clever. I honestly think this game would be better off being a one-time pay or a small monthly fee. Ultimately I will probably have to quit because of frustration of not wanting to put any more money into it, and no longer being able to quest without doing so. It will be a struggle that my pocket will win.<br /><br />As long as you are aware of the possible financial consequences of playing this game, you will otherwise find it extremely enjoyable and satisfying mobile adventure.

B00EKQ3YZI|1.0|I don't even know where to begin - the over produced mixes, the lack of original and unreleased material or the FACT that one of the songs has Donna's vocals removed and replaced with someone else's -----THAT'S RIGHT, one song doesn't even have her original vocals....it's clearly someone else TRYING to do a lame imitation of Donna.<br /><br />I REFUSE to buy the physical copy and will be content with the digital release on Rhapsody.  The remixers of today stripped out the magic of the music and the vocals that made these songs classics and S * * * all over them....simply to put their STANK on her material.<br /><br />Donna would not have tolerated this lame release, and neither will I.  Listen for yourself but don't say you were not warned in advanced!

B00B78AIV0|2.0|I liked this book all the way to the end. Kimbali, though too timid, was an interesting and very humble character. She lived to please her father and pleased her father to live. I was also able to relate to Eugene, Kimbali's father, because I grew up in a house under the duress of domestic abuse. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I got the notion that Eugene was abusive primarily because he loved his family... He often wept after beating them, and while he was an overly strict disciplinarian, he was rigidly loyal to the Christian religion (which I could appreciate) and he was an advocate for freedom of the press. He also wasn't afraid to tout off about his favorable views of democracy in his newspaper. In all honesty, I sort of thought of Eugene as the hero of the story, save for his abusive tendencies. But keep in mind, this may be from my own misguided thoughts due to my former presence in a highly dysfunctional family. I grew accustomed to abuse as a child and a teenager, and yet, I still love my father to this day. It's my opinion that had Eugene undergone some very intensive Christian counseling, he may well have been what you would call a protagonist. Suffice to say, I found Eugene to be one of the more interesting characters, both for his monstrosity and his redeeming qualities.<br /><br />My main problem with this novel was the hurried ending. It never was clear who killed Eugene-- the mother or Kimbali's brother, Jaja. And it read as thought the author had been thinking to herself, \\"Oh yeah, I've got to end this story at a reasonable word count because it's my first novel and the agents may reject it if it's too long for a first timer.\\" Also, regardless of whether or not it was Jaja or Kimbali's mother who killed Eugene, it just wasn't in their character and it didn't come across as believable, thus making not only one character come across as \\"flat,\\" but two. E.M. Forester sums it up nicely when he says (and I'm paraphrasing here) that a character can beflat if they act in a certain way throughout the course of the novel and unexpectedly do something drastic which doesn't come across as being a believable part of their character so that a plot can be resolved.<br /><br />Overall, this was good for a first novel, and I'd be willing to give the author another chance in the future... I liked the political finagling at the beginning, and Kimbali's love interest in Father Amadali drove the mid portion of the book, but I was SOOO disappointed with the ending. And ya know, the beginning of a book sells the reader on buying that book, but the ending sells that same author's next book, and for the sake of this particular ending, I wasn't satisfied. As I mentioned, however, I will give this author another chance because the novel did have such great potential. Keep in mind, I'm no pro reviewer, but I appreciate you taking the time to read my thoughts and I hope that they were helpful.

B000S46QOM|4.0|For Vinyl Junkies only (being as it was never issued on CD), this wonderful, not-so-hard-to-find '72 double record set is a well-balanced, well-selected, excellently paced Overview that acts as a kind of counterpart to the 1970 \\"13\\" album (also never issued to CD)...<br /><br />A Bit of History with some Opinions Sprinkled in:<br />I'm always a little amazed at the tremendous historical pop-culture adoration the Doors seem to command... Particularly for what is (on close inspection) a kind of a spotty track record. If you REALLY start listening to the entire Morrison/Doors LP's (or CD's) in chronological order, things can get tedious fast. Krieger himself admitted in a number of interviews that they knew they only had enough material for two and a half records at the time of their signing. And with Elektra President Jac Holzman nixing the idea of \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\" taking up the entire second side of the \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" LP, they were flat-out scrambling for material to fill that release... but I'm getting ahead of myself;<br /><br />With regards to their Debut album, I once read that \\"the promise of the first record was never fulfilled\\"; This is a very prophetic statement... (although to me, the sophomore \\"Strange Days\\" is actually their best all-around effort; through the years, it's the one I always seem to gravitate back to).<br />The aforementioned third album (\\"Waiting For The Sun\\") revels the group running out of gas, while \\"Soft Parade\\" is not only the weakest in their cannon, it's also one of the WORST albums in rock history. The surviving band members have defended this record by saying that everybody was using horns at that time - but the crux of the matter is, that whole \\"brass\\" thing SO flew in the face of their original musical statements that it now seems like a total sell-out.<br />Regrouping and going almost in a sideways (bluesy) direction, \\"Morrison Hotel\\" was not only an amazing come-back, but one of the GREATEST albums in rock history. Then, while the band was catching it's creative breath, Electra issued the superior, underrated \\"Absolutely Live!\\". Painstakingly edited from a number of concert performances throughout `69-`70, this is a standout record: Not only would the listener have no idea that this was seamlessly spliced together from so many sources (think about doing THAT with scissors and recording tape in the pre-digital age), it also shows the Doors trying to create a true atmosphere for the fans at their appearances, as opposed to just running through a greatest hits set and splitting. Also released at this time was the above-mentioned \\"13\\", a kind of \\"Best Of\\" up to this point (but billed as \\"...13 Classic Doors Songs\\").<br />Persuaded to sign up for one more release, the band produced the enigmatic \\"L.A. Woman\\", which could be viewed as either \\"they've still got it!\\", or \\"boy, they went out in style!\\"<br /><br />Which brings us back to 1972's \\"Weird Scenes Inside the Goldmine\\". If you don't want to have to go through all the valleys just to experience the peaks, this is a fine overview (and nicely mixed up chronologically, to boot!).

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|early adopter tax includes but not limited to:<br /><br />* Netflix can only watch one at a time, no repeat mode<br />* Double buffering first to start stream on PC, then futzing with UI to cast it over to TV, could be cleaner<br />* Noted as beta, Google Tab cast definitely lives up to beta designation<br />* Must use Wifi to cast meaning old school cats using Ethernet (for its superior latency and timing advantages) cannot cast.  We still exist and have feelings, Google!  Blech Wifi only mode.<br /><br />I am being a bit harsh, because it's mostly wonderful and pleasant, the video quality is top notch, and for the price, pretty dope all around.

I am experimenting with trying to find a cheaper medium but so far I keep coming back to these.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I didn't particularly enjoy the ending though I can't say I'm up in arms the way many people are. I'm not sure it really fit. I think she did it to separate herself from all the other YA fiction she gets lumped in with. I really enjoyed the first 2 books and the cliffhanger at the end of Insurgent was excellent. This just didn't live up to my expectations. I had issues with the plot (is our country so isolated that we can't procreate with citizens of any other country to &#34;fix our genes&#34;?).  I had issues with the contrived Tris/Tobias narrators (I could not keep them straight).  Makes sense given the ending, but that makes it more of a cop-out.  I just feel like it's the same plot every book now. There was nothing about this book that was special. I can't recommend the series now because of this since it's just a let down.
0142501123|5.0|This book is really cute, fun and easy to read. BUT!! The **dvd** of it is soo much better than the book because it brings everything to life, it's funny!and the voices are Great! I personally thought the cranky cat and it's (facial)expressions in the dvd were a Huge, funny hit, but all the facial expressions,sounds effects,and reactions of all the animals: the witch's cat, the dog, the bird and the frog, to the events in the story were so cute/great! I liked that the witch is so happy and welcoming to the other broom riders (each time to the cat's dismay). The dvd is totally feel good, funny and happy. The villian:dragon in the end, plays a good part. I didn't find it too scary and the kids I watched it with didn't seem to either.<br />I watched the dvd with a 5 yr old, a 6 yr old and a 9 yr old and every one of them has really enjoyed the dvd. The  feelings and reactions displayed in the dvd are very relatable too for kids. I very HIGHLY recommend pairing the book WITH the **dvd**.  Enjoy~

B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book! I loved the author's development of the characters and the twists and turns, especially between parts 1 and 2. It kept me guessing and thinking. I'll be looking forward to the movie.
B001DUDKEY|4.0|This is a nice period movie. You can watch it over and over again, always enjoying the simple love story and the scenery.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Wow, not at all what I expected. I have to agree with a couple of the other reviewers when they say they are disappointed. This book took a 180 degree turn from the first 2 in the trilogy. I know this is sci-fi, but it has to be BELIEVABLE to some degree. Some of the \\"coincidences\\" are a little far-fetched to say the least. While the character development is great, the plot line is essentially unbelievable, almost like the author wanted to just put something out there to get the series finished. I greatly enjoyed the first 2 books, but this one is a stinker!
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you like books that keep you guessing the entire time... this book is for you!!!  Definitely a Must Read!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The third book did not disappoint. Ended the series with me wanting more, one can dream of a series that chronicles what happens next.

B00DWZHTRW|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  I was immediately drawn into the story - and the story was good.  The twists and turns were really good and plausiable.  It is a movie you need to watch at least twice.  What I liked about it, is none of the clues were hidden - if I was really paying attention, I would have figured it out.<br /><br />And that is just the story - the acting was amazing.  The cast is top notch.  And it was visually cool!<br /><br />This is a movie that I could recommend to any one - no violence, swearing, nudity, etc.  It is definitely worth watching.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am enjoying the history that the family and the servants at Downtown Abbey have become caught up in as part of their story, and how each person is dealing with it.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this device originally to complement my Apple TV but it has all but replaced it now. I used to have an iPhone and iPad but have since moved onto an Android phone and Nexus 7 tablet. When I was part of the Apple ecosystem, everything worked great with Apple TV with it's Airplay and streaming music from devices or PC, it was great.<br /><br />Now that I'm using Android based devices, I wanted to give the Chromecast device a shot for 2 very specific reasons:<br /><br />* I watch a lot of You Tube and Netflix. Apple TVs interface for You Tube and Netflix (or the one built it into my Bluray player for that matter) isn't exactly the smoothest to use. Searching, typing, navigating around can be cumbersome and klunky. Now I'm able to queue up things, navigate, search both You Tube and Netflix with ease on my Nexus. The best part is once I queue up something to play, I can continue using my tablet without disturbing the playback or draining my battery. I can search for that next set of You Tube clips I want to play and add them to the queue.<br /><br />*I stream most of my TV from my laptop since I cut the cord. I have had very little issues streaming content from a website to my TV through the Chrome browser. Now I don't have to have an HDMI cable hooked up and I have my Chromecast connected to my receiver so I get everything over my home stereo system. Occasionally there are some hiccups like it stops playing or rubberbands but by and large it works very well for not needing any wiring.<br /><br />Those two points alone and the ease at which I can do them are worth the $35 to me. I still use my Apple TV but primarily it's used for streaming my music from my PC, catching up on NBA, NHL or MLB highlights with their respective apps for free or checking out the Apple Trailer app to watch movie trailers. That's probably about 10-15% of the streaming I do though and the bulk is now handled by the little Chromecast.<br /><br />I'm docking it a star because of it's lack of ability to have the option to do true mirroring like Apple does & the inability to send local content easily to the Chromecast. If it was able to do that, this would be a phenomenal device but I understand that Google is more or less in the hosting/cloud content business.<br /><br />I love it and recommend it but know what purpose you want to use it for. It's serving my purposes quite nicely. If you have the majority of music being housed in iTunes like myself, having the Apple TV just to stream to a home stereo system is justification enough to have one the Apple TVs too. They complement each other pretty well in my setup and uses.

0062183591|5.0|Smooth, enjoyable reading that brings new surprising angles about the act of cheating to light, and heightens and clarifies your own introspective awareness.<br /><br />If you're like me and want the conceptual framework and the quick take-aways up front -- to then frame all the juicy details -- simply read first the chapter, \\"A Semioptimistic Ending: People Don't Cheat Enough!\\" (the final chapter, at least in the hardcover version).<br /><br />Eric Siegel, Ph.D.<br />Founder, Predictive Analytics World<br />Author, [[ASIN:1118356853 Predictive Analytics: The Power to Predict Who Will Click, Buy, Lie, or Die]]
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|love this book, couldn't put it down!  The tests at the end were really helpful.  Would highly recommend this book.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Funding fun fun and is addictive and with cool graphics . Just wish that it wouldn't take so long to save up money to build.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|I love David Sedaris and this is one of my favorites.  Taking difficult childhood experiences a lot of us can relate to and making them humorous and memorable.  nice job.
B00BNR6RH4|5.0|We bought this as a birthday present for my father-in-law, who is a huge Beatles/McCartney fan. And lately, has been getting into the vinyl editions of all his biggest hits.<br />He had nothing but praise for this vinyl, and said it was great quality. It went well as a present which means we were happy. Great vinyl for McCartney fans.
B000SGRONM|5.0|I love the hilarious take on holidays.  I have listened to this book on tape as well and that is VERY funny too.  I think this is a fun book to gift at the holiday times as well and will be doing so AGAIN this year.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is fun for all ages, we all enjoy the expressions on the girls face. And the hair styles can be awful and funny, or cute and interesting.
B0045XKJBI|4.0|I read these books to talk about them with my little sister.  yeah, they are pretty good and fine for teenagers, but I wouldn't recommend them for kids younger than that.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|It's a cute song, but you get bored with the game very quickly. My ten yr. Old daughter was excited about this game and played  two or three times, bit has never gone back to it, it seems a bit trendy.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|cannot wait for the next in the series to come out, and I am so glad that I read these before the show aired.  Can't wait to see what is to come!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I downloaded this as a free app and so far it's going good and playing fine on the Kindle Fire HD. It's fun and fairly easy (however, I've only played the first four levels, so....). Worth a buck, I feel. Happy Halloween to everyone!!
B004X6PRO6|2.0|this book did not capture me the way I thought it would.  I am going to try reading it again to see if it sparks my interest, but it lost me not even half way through the first time I tried to read it.  I will amend my rating if I can in the future.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have never had 1 problem with this app!! Plus just SO much fun!! Frustrating at times,  difficultly wise, but always fun!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|not quite trashy, but also very unrealistic.  I read this at 30, had I read it at 20?  i hope it wouldn't have made me think unrealistic things about the dating world. haha. not as great of an ending as I thought, but also very unrealistic way this story finished.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I have read this book a few times since I downloaded it and I love it every time. It is one of those books you can't predict so you must read on until you realise you've been reading for hours and neglected to eat or use the restroom.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|not quite trashy, but also very unrealistic.  I read this at 30, had I read it at 20?  i hope it wouldn't have made me think unrealistic things about the dating world. haha.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|THIS GAME IS ADDICTIVE.  I AM STILL LEARNING THE INS AND OUTS AND DON'T LIKE WHEN I AM FORCED TO STOP.  I TRIED IT TO SEE WHAT THE HOOPLAH WAS ABOUT.  NOW I THINK I AM HOOKED.
0545268850|2.0|good story, I really couldn't stand the voice of the narrator, but a really touching look into war horses.  preview first.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I enjoyed this story and looking forward to reading the book 2 in this series.  Might as well get all the Pride series at once. GAB
B002NT3B52|5.0|I really loved this book, it was both informative and humbling for all I think I knew about my pets as a veterinarian and owner.  I love the relationship of the owner to her dog Pump, and think it has some really great tips to form a special bond with their pets and understand them better.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Looks like actual hardware calculator...  Great look and feel...  Thanks for getting rid of the old boring calculator app of Android...

1470899256|4.0|Although the author explained his bias about Nazi's and bent over backward to explain that the German pilot wasn't a Nazi, I felt like the American position wasn't as thoroughly presented. However, the writing was explanatory AND descriptive. The story was well done except for the last part which degenerated into sentimentality. In any event, I would be willing to listen to the audiobook again in another five years. It's not so good that I would want to listen to it immediately after hearing it the first time.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|great books, so glad I read these prior to the show coming out.  Cannot wait for the next books to come out!
B00G32QIEG|5.0|Really enjoyed this move, the comedy was outstanding. I would highly suggest this movie to anyone looking for a laugh. Jeff Bridges is so funny.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book follows the intertwined lives of a small community and at the end of each chapter, I was itching to read the next installment, further into the book!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This is one heck of a knife. If I could only carry one knife this would be it. Worth every penny
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This is an intriguing book for less than obvious reasons, but a perfect way to kick off a series. I was attracted to it because, well it was free on Kindle and, and, and I have been an advertising copywriter myself (like Maggie Newberry the narrator).<br /><br />But here’s what I didn’t expect the family is told her sister is dead, but she later turns up in the States only to be murdered. As a reader, I learn something from the first bit of news that later, like Maggie, I will experience. Also the narrator realizes that she’s 32 years old and still hasn’t found “the one.”<br /><br />When she does, the handsome, Laurent Dernier, a nefarious Frenchman is connected to the events leading to the murder.<br /><br />Too often today, we are given one-dimensional characters. I didn’t get as much Southern France as I expected, but what I did get were people with real, internal mystery that made me turn the page. And…look forward to more of in this series.<br /><br />Jack Lehman, Rosebud Book Reviews.com
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|First, let me preface this by saying that I'm a huge android and google fan. I use almost all of their services and have owned google tvs (sucked), multiple tablets and at least 5 android flagship phones (currently the note 3).<br /><br />That being said.. this device is a solution to a problem that does not exist.<br /><br />First, it needs an intermediary wireless network to ride on and communicate with your phone/tablet. This means it's completely worthless for travel unless you bring your own wireless AP, as you'll never get the proper speeds (and likely ports opened) to work in a hotel anywhere.<br /><br />Second, if this is really just intended for home use, there's a myriad of devices that all do what it promises to do, way better. Most modern TVs, rokus, game systems or even blu-ray players have at least the same functionality, if not more. You're limited to about 6 pre-determined apps, like NetFlix, Pandora, Hulu, Youtube, etc. My TV does all of those already, plus it has Plex, HBO Go, etc. If it had screen sharing and let me broadcast anything, then it would be worth something<br /><br />Third, it DOES have wifi-direct! but that's only for initial configuration, what a waste.<br /><br />Finally, here was my ideal scenario in which it would fail: On travel for work, have some downtime at my hotel, don't want to watch their TV. Plug this into the HDMI port, connect to my phone which has unlimited LTE data and stream my media from home (plex), HBO Go, Netflix or whatever, without relying on the hotel's wifi. Nope, that's not going to happen with this device.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I gotta say I was skeptical that this book could hold up as the &#34;sequel&#34; to The Shining but hold up it does......I loved the story line and the relationship with Abra......I do feel the confrontation seemed a little rushed and anti-climatic but felt it ended the way it needed to
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Casablanca is the perfect movie, in the same way that some concert halls have perfect acoustics.  I can't imagine anything that could improve the movie or the actors' performances.
0060833459|5.0|Good knowledge, experience and resources. learn how to be a better leaders, better boss and how to lead others at workplace.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The actors and the tiger were very impressive and the story was an amazing story of what can happen so suddenly to change your life.  Very inspirational.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great condition, Loved the movie, I was glad I pre-ordered it and it came as expected. My husband loves the new Star Trek movies and I surprise him with this one.
B000AJIF4E|2.0|The jack for these headphones do not fit the iPhone 5; however, they will fit you iPad.  Not as advertised.
B004H6G0TI|1.0|I was expecting an old school style jet fighter arcade game but this was not it. Deleted it after only a few plays.
B00G32OER4|3.0|One of the first things I heard about when moving to Connecticut was Ed and Lorraine Warren. Last night (night before Halloween) Ms. Warren gave a lecture to a sold-out crowd at SCSU. Not only The Conjuring, but many other movies have been created based off of their work, such as The Haunted and The Haunting in Connecticut. They are also featured in the book THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, which has been the basis of ten films.<br /><br />As for The Conjuring, it begins with the story of Annabelle, the possessed doll (Google \\"the Warrens Annabelle\\" for a creepy tale). I wish the movie ventured more into this tale, but they had to move on to the haunting that took place in Rhode Island.<br /><br />Once viewers are brought to Rhode Island, everything moves at a nice slow-burned pace. Any creepy moments are signified by the shaking of the camera. Admittedly, this would be a lame technique if used throughout, but it's not. About halfway through the movie, things ramp-up to full scare mode. Things fly off of walls, shadows move out of the corners, doors slam, and the monster shows itself.<br /><br />Everything worked together nicely until about the end. Movies based in reality are particularly scary to me, but when the \\"this is somewhat believable\\" moment is broken, the movie lost its effect. I don't want to reveal end-of-movie spoilers, but I think it's safe to say what happens to the person needing exorcised was a bit over-the-top.<br /><br />Overall the movie was very well done and the acting crew did a phenomenal job. I can't say it's the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it was enough to leave me with the creepy jitters for the rest of the night.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I love them. Linear. Comfortable. Wow. This is the music I have been missing. For the price, these are what you want.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|This film embodies all the characteristics I love about the Die Hard franchise - Bruce Willis swagger. It never becomes a caricature of itself. It never dates itself. A Good Day to Die Hard moves the setting to a foreign country for the first time. And because of its location it tip-toes on the tightrope of the ugly American, but it never loses its footing. Mr. Willis plays John McClane better than any other actor plays a long running franchise hero, simply because he allows the character to age with wisdom as well as brawn. A Good Day is a worthy chapter in the Die Hard saga.
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|This is some of the best 3d I've seen since avatar. Lots already said about the movie. So I'm speAking to the 3d content only. The dept is exceptional. Top rating.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've enjoyed reading my Kindle books on my tablet using this app. The tablet screen is larger, and in some cases I enjoy the books more on the tablet, depending on where I am. I likemy Kindle Fire better for my books while traveling, however.

B0068MNO4S|5.0|I found this story to be completely memorizing whether it was true or not. For me it seemed as though Shakespear rose from the dead to write another story about his own fraudulent past. Amazing, definitely buy!

B006LSZECO|5.0|Nothing predictable about this novel.  It's thoroughly enjoyable and unusual as most fictionalized crime stories are so contrived as to be unbelievable.  This novel is excellent and well written.

B00D6B4PUG|4.0|Naturally you have to have a Gmail account...dah. Like most apps this works rather quickly and bypasses many other steps to get the end result. Now how about other Emails like Outlook, Hotmail, etc.
B005LY4B0A|2.0|You have to prevent the spider from getting to it's prey by cutting the strings, Which he uses to move around with. Does take a bit of time to fully figure out how to beat a level. Not a bad game though, Just sort of average because it doesn't really look impressive graphically and the game play gets sort of old after a while. Can't say I'd recommend buying it though, Mind you I got it from a free app promotion.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|No! Photoshop it isn't! Don't get your hopes up that editing your photographs is as progressive as Adobe, but for the COST what have you to loose? Gets the job done for most novices and that is all that counts.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|A little bit of suspense the first few times you play but then it gets rather old pretty quickly. And isn't this a free browser game to begin with? So why make people pay for it?
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Very clever! Totally glad I got this fun game... Lots of levels to work through. Very charming vampire... I would recommend this game. Totally worth the download.
B00CHS31DG|1.0|No tutorial at all so the game leaves you to figure it out on your own. Either way, It's painfully stupid and not even close to being worth 2 dollars. Flat out rip off.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey storyline is wonderful! I enjoy the characters, the settings, and the era. I will continue to watch it as long as they continue the series.
B00FOU1O3S|2.0|No problems with the game play, I actually thought it was one of the better bowling games I have ever played. It just doesn't offer enough to the user to keep playing. I think once they add more affordable content, It'd be a better game.
1449305172|5.0|This book is a must-read for any entrepreneur starting new venture. Ash Maurya developed a blueprint from Lean Startup Framework.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|You pretty much just walk around and spam hold the fire button to kill endless waves of zombies to complete levels. It doesn't take long to complete the story but survival mode certainly adds a bit of a challenge/fun to the game. Solid dialogue is entertaining as well. Would like to see more content for it but other than that, It's a pretty solid game.
B000I62JBE|5.0|Deniro was great in this, and the guy who played the challenged individual  did a great job too. I liked the ending.
B005V20JKI|3.0|A simple platform game where you collect muffins for experience, Collecting a certain amount of muffins unlocks other characters as well. Leveling up gives you points, Allowing you to upgrade characters, It just 1 point for the first upgrade, 2 for the next (to fully upgrade the character) and you get 1 point each level. I also like how you switch characters each muffin you collect, It's random so you never know who you get next.<br /><br />That being said, You can only get up so many levels before you hit the max. You can only fully upgraded the first line of characters and that's it so wait until you unlock a lot/all of the characters before upgrading. In order to get more points, You have to pay real money. Sort of a rip off in my opinion, I'd rather deal with annoying ads instead of having to deal with having to pay for things that should already be free. Really hurts the game's value in my opinion.
B000069HJN|3.0|I liked Breakfast in America and Famous Last Words from Supertramp but this album I wasn't sure I wanted to try.  I finally got around to getting it and can say it is only so so.  The title song is just too long.  It has some good moments but would likely be better at about half of it's sixteen minutes.  The album version of Cannonball is good.  All in all this is one that is fine to have but is nothing to be unhappy about if you don't have it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It has been awhile since John Grisham got back to his roots and this book is as good as the first one.  You got to know his character, the crafty minds of lawyers, and read as the story unfolds.  History is rarely forgotten.
B00007KWHP|4.0|I got this album because of Roundabout.  I expected that it might be tht only song I would like on the album.  Turns out I liked about half of this album.  I take that as a win.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Really makes you pay attention. Good thing is they only make you wait 30 minutes to get your lives back.
B000PATZQK|3.0|Time of the Season is the stand out song on this album.  The other songs are fine but nothing close to as good as Time of the Season.  I was just hoping for better from the other songs.  Not a bad album but not the classic I had heard it was.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I love this music album because the music is just so well done! Pretty straightforward. It sounds great, different songs create different moods and each song will fit different styles (or all styles altogether).<br />I would recommend this to anybody who likes the original songs or likes classic music.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|At Paul McCartney's age to do as good as this is a surprise.  Many of these songs are quite good and none are bad.  For fifteen songs to be good with no clunkers is a very good album.  New is well worth having.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Came a day early! My son is now obsessed with Toy story with makes this Disney nut so proud! Love putting out blue ray player to good use!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this app is really good because it is fun and entertaining and it really does feel like time is flying like when you are on a hoverboard. I also that this game is good because it is for anyone in the family. I say this because I am 12 years old and.I really enjoy this game. I also know people younger and older than me that enjoy this game so if you do not have this game you really don't know what you are missing!! Thank you for reading my review xx
B003U4UPHG|5.0|I normally don't watch miniseries TV but my daughter gave name and I found it.  Fabulous series!  We now watch 1 or more episodes a night and cannot wait for more.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I found myself thinking about this book and eagerly anticipating the next instalment. I loved the way the book intertwined generations, how it worked its way from either end of the story to meet in the middle, and how the finale hit me from nowhere. Excellent closure!
0756686970|5.0|I bought this for my 8 year old and it was a HUGE hit! A no brainer for little Star Wars fans.
