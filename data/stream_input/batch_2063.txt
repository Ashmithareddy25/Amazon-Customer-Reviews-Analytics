B004SBQGHS|5.0|I like my Angry Birds.  Bank lines, grocery lines.....even at home when I'm &#34;relaxing&#34;.  It's always there on my phone and Kindle, and there is always a level that's boggling me.  Guess I'm making up for not having such fun things at my fingertips when I was young.....I like it.

1594487154|5.0|I have read other books by Daniel Pink, and I must have I have enjoyed all of them.  The book is informative, well written (not dry at all), and makes sense for today's world.  I have recommended this book to several people.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Seriously, 3rd highest grossing film of all time (not accounting for inflation), incredible cast, brilliant director. The epic story that stays true to its comic roots in epicness, awesomeness. A few years in the making. This was a very thoughtfully done piece.
B0041KVWI4|5.0|When Capitol Records decided to issue the Magical Mystery Tour album in LP form rather than in the double 7\\" EP format as issued in the UK, they did not wait for stereo mixes of The Beatles' 1967 singles to arrive from England so \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"Baby You're A Rich Man\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love\\" was issued in electronically rechanneled stereo.  It wasn't until the MMT LP was issued in Germany in 1971 that all the tracks were issued in true stereo.  When the LP was officially issed in the UK in 1976, they used the Capitol masters with the fake stereo tracks. When it was decided to issue the American MMT album on CD and make it part of The Beatles' canon of original albums, they used the German album as the basis for the CD. For the remastered MMT LP, everything is restored to the way the LP was issued in 1967 with the original rainbow Capitol label and, even better, with every track in true stereo. If you want MMT in vinyl, this is the version to obtain.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|While I mostly enjoyed the series, the one-liners and stupid scenarios in The Panther just went a bit overboard for me.  And, I don't care if John Corey has another dual with the CIA - I think I'm done reading.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|It took a lot of courage for Jaycee to write this book.  I'm hoping that it has some theraputical advantages for her.  She is a remarkable individual who survived the worst of the worst and came out on the other side standing strong.  Welcome home Jaycee!!

B00B2V66VS|4.0|its a really good app. its lots of fun and entertaining. it has a lot of new features. you should defenitly get it. I do have a problem I accidentally uninstallled the app and I downloaded it again but now the app wont open. this is pretty much the only reason I'm giving 4 stars insted of 5. Help if u know how yo fix it!! :D
B008HT4FUW|2.0|The quality was not good. I put Disk 3 in the DVD player and when it appeared on my TV screen, it was reading disk 1. There was something wrong with the disks. I believe it was not the original DVD. i would say that it was a copy.<br /><br />The picture on the third disk was not clear and defined. The picture had a blue tint to it. Poor quality. I sent the set back and ordered the original set through PBS - Masterpiece Theater. I will never order anything from Amazon again, except dog training books.<br /><br />I believe there are  counterfeiters who list their products with Amazon.
B00AYB20KI|4.0|There are not enough psychological triller movies anymore! I like to be scared by movies that are almost believable---- because the fake &/or bloody movies like Blair Witch, Scream, Saw...just aren't realistic enough! This movie was creepy enough for me & the twists/turns were interesting!! Glad I found it on Amazon!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Forbidden Planet was years ahead of its time. It's an adaptation of the Tempest, set on a distant planet, and handles things very cleverly. There's humor, romance, adventure, and cliches you'll be reciting for years to come. If it seems derivative, remember, this movie came first.

B008OOYALE|4.0|Little slow at first but quickly became an addiction...especially once you start breeding new dragons!  Game is best played with others.  Once I joined the forum the game moved MUCH quicker.

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This movie looks like it was shot yesterday! I own many bluray movies and I just have to say that this one looks as good as any new movie out there. I have some movies, made in the past decade, that don't look as good as this one does, on bluray! A lot of care was put into this transfer. The price is right, also! Especially for this box set! Highly recommended! And don't tell me you wouldn't be caught dead, with &#34;The Sound Of Music&#34; in your library because YOU and everybody else out there knows that that's NOT true!!!!! Ahhhh!!! - guilty pleasures! So man-up and buy it! You could always tell your biker friends that it's the director that you love. After all, Robert Wise DID also direct the originals of &#34;The Day The Earth Stood Still&#34; (1951) and &#34;The Haunting&#34; (1963). Enjoy!
B007SPPANM|5.0|The cast was fantastic.  And so was the scenery.  I can't believe how much direction it must have taken in order to make this movie

B001UREJWM|5.0|Comprised of Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Vinnie Appice, Heaven And Hell have everything in common with Black Sabbath -- well everything except the name. Their sole album, 2009's debut \\"The Devil You Know\\" is irrefutable proof that this is one excellent assortment of musicians, and to say that they definitely know what they're doing (and how to write and perform truly great traditional metal) would be an understatement. Filled to the brim with great riffs, amazing solos, prominent bass lines, and steady drumming -- and not to mention Dio's trademark wail -- \\"The Devil...\\" practically has \\"essential listen\\" written all over it. And it might come close to, but ultimately falls just short of the level of excellence achieved on Sabbath's last great album, 1980's \\"Heaven And Hell,\\" but it as good as anything with Dio's name attached to it this side of his classic solo album, 1983's \\"Holy Diver.\\"<br /><br />The ten-song set gets underway with an energetic, thumping drum intro that flows into a thunderous bass groove. But even though the bass lines remain viscerally heavy throughout \\"Atom And Evil,\\" they are complimented nicely by meaty, lumbering rhythms and air-guitar-able licks. And later, an excellent, soaring and wailing guitar solo pierces the air. And all the while this is going on, the vocals remain vintage Dio -- catchy, contagious, and cleanly-sung. \\"Bible Black,\\" is another big standout. It begins with a nicely melodic and minor-key intro before the rest of the band comes screaming in, and provide definitely ample back-up propulsion. (It comes in the form of inspirational, emphatic guitar soloing -- including one ripping, and one blazing, shredding solo near the end -- a grumbling bass bottom, and stellar, soaring singing. All of which combine together to concoct a great, deeply rolling groove, too.)<br /><br />Later on, the band throw you a bit of a curveball by tossing in some Judas Priest-y near speed metal-lite tempos. For two examples of this, see the fiery, muscularly grooving \\"Double The Pain,\\" and \\"The Turn Of The Screw,\\" which offers up two more excellent guitar solos (the first of which being a wailing, and technically-proficient solo; the second being a ripping, mazy, whammy-bar-soaked solo). And track number two, \\"Fear,\\" also flirts with brisk, aggressive, near speed-metal-lite tempos, but expertly intersperses them with droning, doomy sections.<br /><br />\\"Rock  And Roll Angel\\" is another industrial-strength number, this one having solid, chunky, crunching licks, meaty-sounding rhythms, and humming, bottom-heavy bass lines. The tune's outro is also noteworthy, as it ends with a rhythmically catchy, martial drum beat, another really excellent and epic melodic solo, and even some gorgeous clean guitar strumming. \\"Eating The Cannibals,\\" meanwhile, barrels out of the starting gate at full blast and with surprisingly crushing grooves and wild, careening guitar shredding. The end result sounds not unlike a song produced by the likes of Mastodon, High On Fire, Sleep, and Corrosion Of Conformity.<br /><br />\\"Follow The Tars\\" is also of note, as it is a piece of traditional, straight-up doom metal. It has repetitive, droning, lumbering guitars, a sludgy wall-of-sound, and a hauntingly dark atmosphere. And even with some fairly melodic bass lines underpinning the whole thing, the song positively booms out of the speakers. And it is further highlighted by another stellar, shredding, ascending and descending guitar solo. Then, following the deeply grooving and profusely hard rocking \\"Neverwhere\\" (which could pass as either an Iron Maiden or \\"Holy Diver\\"-era Dio b-side), the set concludes with \\"Breaking Into Heaven\\" This is a strong closer, as its strong, droning, doom/stoner metal main riff and distorted bass bottom are iced with Bruce Dickinson-bred with Ozzy Osbourne-esque clean vocals. One more terrific and totally air-guitar-able solo wraps it all up, too.<br /><br />Fun, heavy, infectious, and flawlessly-played, \\"The Devil You Know\\" is not only quite possibly the best traditional heavy metal record of 2009, it also all-but cements Heaven And Hell's status as being the genre's best supergroups of the new millennium. Therefore, it is all the more tragic that H&H had to dissolve when Dio passed away in 2010, because I, like pretty much any metalhead on this toilet earth, was eager to see what else this band had up its sleeve.wlessly-played, \\"The Devil You Know\\" is not only quite possibly the best traditional heavy metal record of 2009, it also all-but cements Heaven And Hell's status as being the genre's best supergroups of the new millennium.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|I like this book and it's a really easy read. I read it in two days, no problem. I would highly recommend this to others, but I didn't like the ending.
B000002549|4.0|I've been a Streisand fan since the early 1960s and a die-hard opera/classical vocal music fan since 1976.  I'm now 63 and still love both with all my heart.  Don't judge Barbra because she is not Margaret Price, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Renee Fleming, or Susan Graham.  Just appreciate her singing and her obvious enjoyment in these songs.  It's fun.  Relax and enjoy it!
B008ASGP3U|4.0|Maverick detective John Rebus, recently retired, is trying to get back on the police force in Edinburgh, but not everyone is happy about that -- especially a detective named Malcolm Fox, who heads up the equivalent of the department's Internal Affairs office.<br /><br />\\"`The file on you,' Fox said eventually, `goes back to the 1970s. In fact, to call it a file is doing it an injustice; it takes up one whole shelf.'<br /><br />\\"`I've been called into the headmaster's office a few times,' Rebus conceded.\\"<br /><br />So it goes in the topsy-turvy life of Ian Rankin's thoroughly unconventional detective. Rebus is brilliant, though he operates astride the fine line between what's legal and what's not, and slips over it from time to time for the sake of getting results. Not only does he close nearly all his cases, but he's also the only person on the force who has ever managed to put away Edinburgh's notorious crime boss, Gerald \\"Big Ger\\" Cafferty.<br /><br />In Standing in Another Man's Grave, Rebus is now working as a civilian employee of the department in a unit devoted to investigating cold cases. The work is unrewarding, and Rebus sees it only as a stepping-stone to getting back into active duty again. Then along comes a chance encounter with a woman who claims to see a pattern in the disappearance over the course of a decade of a number of young women along the A9 highway leading north from Edinburgh to the coast. As Rebus looks into her story, he begins to suspect that she's right -- and, for some reason Rebus finds mysterious, he's the first person on the force to give her the time of day. To do justice to the investigation, Rebus manages to draw his former partner, Siobhan Clarke, now a Detective Inspector, into the case. Soon other detectives pile on in the increasingly fraught investigation as it moves forward, grabbing headlines throughout Britain.<br /><br />Standing in Another Man's Grave is the 18th and most recently published of Rankin's Inspector Rebus novels. It's also, I've learned, the third in a new series of books about Malcolm Fox.<br /><br />This is my second venture into the work of Ian Rankin. Previously, I'd read only Doors Open, which I thoroughly disliked. The dimensionality of the characters in this book compared with the overdrawn caricatures of Doors Open made it, for me, a much more satisfying read. For what it's worth, Rankin is, reportedly, Britain's best-selling author of crime novels.ovels.

B00AMBH70S|3.0|The movie was OK to watch and on pure merit hoped it would be more like a Jason Bourne movie but it is not - Matt Damon MADE those movies what they are .... it is hard to get used to a new cast like this and a different story line ...

B007N9FKCY|3.0|I wanted to really love this game. I've played a bunch of platform games so I thought how cool it would be to have one on my Kindle Fire. The graphics are good but its the moving left and right that I had trouble with. To 'bounce' left you have to touch the left screen and therefore, to bounce right, you have to touch the right screen. I had trouble with this (could be I'm an old dog too...). And since you don't actually make it jump, you are only controlling the left and right direction of the bean.<br /><br />I just had too much trouble getting the feel of it and found it more frustrating than challenging.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I rarely get addicted to games, but this one has me entranced. I've already played it all the way through 3 times!
B002APU580|5.0|Our whole family loved this version, almost as much as the Colin Firth version!!<br />We found humor, snappishness, and sincerity in the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The team behind Temple Run have put together a great sequel to the original running game. The addition of the zip line is my favorite part.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game is fun but the reason a subway iscalled a subway is because sub means under so it is a \\"way\\" that is underground therefore the game desighn is flawed. Also the world tour concept is a little far feched because in some of the places you go there are no subways and does anyone else notice that when you get hit by a train and fly into the screen you are still smiling. Also the daily challenge confuses me. But other than those minor technicalities the game is fun and addicting and it is very similar to Tempe run except people don't need to have tilt sensors on their devices to use it.

B00395ZYVS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  I wanted this strong, intelligent woman to be the loving mother I knew her to be!  India's streets and culture brought back memories of Slumdog Millionaire.

B0041VB8BO|4.0|I bought this album after getting the latest one. I was unfamiliar with this band prior to hearing a few songs on the radio. They have a great blend of songs that vary greatly. I love the non-radio play type songs that have elements of Queen and the Beatles. A refreshing new band that seems to write music they want to hear and not necessarily just for making money in the mainstream world. If you have a wide range of musical interest these guys fit right in. I didn't give fives stars because of the overall production of the album. More the producer or studios fault than the quality of the songs.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|If you haven't used the ESV Study Bible, you are in for a treat. The explanations of each passage, the overviews of each book of the Bible, the maps, the numerous other resources are all Biblical, thoughtful and understandable. This is not an application study Bible. It is more for the teacher or the student who wants to go deeper in understanding God's Word.<br /><br />I love my printed version of the ESV Study Bible, but it is very large, heavy and hard to take on trips. So I downloaded the Kindle product onto my iPad. The convenience of having this tremendous resource on my iPad cannot be overstated. However, I do find it more difficult to navigate than the You Version app, for example. After using it for several weeks, I find that I tend to use the You Version app for reading Bible passages and then switch to the ESV Study Bible on Kindle for more in depth help with a difficult passage.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Cool game for me and other girls too! I rather you get free bling more often though. I like how they keep adding more stuff that only cost kibble.

B00005RY7X|3.0|Good basic party rock.  No real substance here, just some bouncy tunes.  Not that it matters, or maybe it does, but too bad the cover is so icky.
B00B21HC7A|5.0|I was also skeptical about The Hobbit being made into a movie (especially three!), and especially after The Lord of the Rings movies, which I loved.  But Peter Jackson and the cast and crew have outdone themselves (again!) - I was spellbound, mesmerized, and delighted by the first film and can't wait to see the others.  Martin Freeman is the perfect Bilbo, and he made me laugh so many times.  Andy Serkis' Gollum was right on, as well as Ian McKellen as the magnificent Gandalf.  And Richard Armitage as Thorin - he literally took my breath away, I almost fell out of the chair when he came on the screen.  Besides being the handsomest dwarf you could possibly imagine, he got inside the character and made Thorin come alive - he is an amazing actor.  The troop of dwarves were also amazing, very individual characters.  Beyond the cast, the music was fantastic, the New Zealand landscape truly spectacular, and the CGI incredible - and I'm running out of superlatives, so I'd better stop.  Just want to add that I've seen the movie 5 times and I'll probably see it a couple more times and I can't wait to get the DVD so I can see it again at home - don't miss it!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|i lov it but every time i try to get in to it it dosent work. i think that its fun feeding my horse is my favorit

B0083SBMBM|4.0|I would have preferred a less generic set of bad guys (not counting Loki, who was very good). The aliens were just a bit too obvious a cannon fodder. Otherwise a great film.
0316228532|2.0|I read to escape, but too much of this story hit too close to home. This book did not fulfill what I look for in a novel.

1416955070|3.0|I will start by saying I'm not a fan of YA novels unless they're written by Neil Gaiman. I have read one other series and enjoyed it, but I always feel I need something deeper. When I picked up this book I was looking for a fast, easy read, and it delivered. I gave it three stars because I enjoyed it, but I did so with some caveats. I liken it to an action movie that you watch because you need to be entertained. You don't expect a fantastic, original plot, and you end up having a good time.<br /><br />I won't deny the similarities in the basic plot of purifying blood lines between HP and The Mortal Instruments. And Jace does remind me a bit of Draco. I'm personally a big fan of folklore and fantasy, and I enjoy traditional fae and vampires and werewolves, and their history, and this doesn't quite deliver there, either. Particularly with the fae, but I feel so few get that \\"right\\". I think the actual writing was a bit lackluster, but again, it's aimed at high school kids, not 32 year old moms with English degrees. I like to put myself in the shoes of a character, which is easy when it's someone around my age, or someone completely made up. Not so much a 15 year old girl. I found myself thinking things like \\"Why on earth would her mother let her be at a club at midnight in the middle of NYC at 15 years old\\" a bit too often. At the same time, it's a quick, mostly uncomplicated read with a lot of action and decently developed characters.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you want action, a decent, if not altogether compelling story, this fits the bill. It's not fantasitc, but I did enjoy it, even as a reader of much more adult type novels.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Omg! this is so awesome the sequel is a little challenging but great get it get now!!!!! better than the first temple run

B00992CF6W|5.0|if you go on 4shared.com you can get it for free just click download and you can get the same thing as this minecraft and get all the same updates and some are higher versions
B00A8ECU24|3.0|this game is very cute and alot like the show. my daughter really enjoys it but some mission require to much money. at one point in order to complete a mission 5 friends were needed. my daughter is 4 where is she going to get 5 friends to add on facebook for this game? so she cant go farther in the game unless i spend a ton of money on gems in order for her to skip missions and buy charaters. other then that she loves the mini games and all the charaters that she can buy.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|So we have owned another version of this game called &#34;Settlers of Canaan&#34; Made by the same people after this game came out. Ironically I think their Canaan version is more interesting with more ways to win and greater strategy. I like that Catan can have a different map each time where the Canaan version always has the same lay out. Got this on Christmas and played it once with the kids, was ok but have not jumped back in to try it again.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Emily Griffin is always great. Hopefully we will meet Darcy and Rachel in future novels if only as supporting cast....

0553108034|5.0|When reading this book it evolved the story line from book one but also the real personalities began to emerge. Left me wanting more immediately.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Excellent. I could not put this book down. It gave so much insight to what happens when in a minute your life changes forever<br />and how hard it is living as a  quadriplegic.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The tale reminded me a little of the old Sabu romps, except for the grit and gore endured by the main character.  I did laugh at the ending...a sort of &#34;if you don't like that one, try this one&#34; approach.  Just left me wanting.
0743289692|5.0|Fascinating story.  How much is true is a good question to research.  I have read a great deal about Ayaan HIrsi Ali since reading her book and wonder how much of this really happened.  It is a good read, though.
B000HKYA1I|5.0|don't know how I missed this one when it was released, but am so happy I found it!  A touching, deep, but also humorous look at life and relationships.  Bravo!

B00AU2B0DE|4.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />The extent of my Justin Bieber experience until now = listening to the song \\"Baby\\" over and over with my five year old, watching the Glee episode where they sing \\"Baby,\\" hearing somebody on THE X FACTOR or AMERICAN IDOL doing a Justin Bieber song (I think it's usually \\"As Long As You Love Me\\"), and hearing or reading countless references to him in the media.<br /><br />This is the first Justin Bieber album I have listened to from start to finish.  It's decent - why is everyone so hard on him? The biggest fault I find with this album is Bieber's tendency to overuse vocal runs, which can make him sound whiny and annoying at times.<br /><br />But there is a lot to like here.  Most of the acoustic playing sounds good, his voice is pleasant enough when he's not overdoing it on the runs, and songs like \\"Boyfriend,\\" \\"As Long As You Love Me, and \\"She Don't Like the Lights\\" have a teenage drama that is kind of magnetic.  The unplugged approach should help at least some of the naysayers realize he is an actual human being and a real musician who can sing and play pretty well - yes some of his lyrics are kind of dopey but he's a kid and kids can be kind of dopey.<br /><br />I won't be craving Biebs and his music and I may never listen to this album again on purpose, but I can see why his fans like him and if he makes their lives a little more fun and interesting then good for them.  And good for him.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Great story, well constructed,informative and keeps moving at a great pace. Nice to read a book that is not all about treasures etc.the main character is very human, no super strength,but what a survivor.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I purchased this with a MagSafe one power adapter generic palm safe or something like that. That power supply is no longer available but they both worked well together. I super glued the small adapter onto it just so I would have not lose it or make it fall off since I have a MagSafe two MacBook Air.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun I can play it for hours. I'm a horse lover I have my own and this is what I can do when mine don't need cared for. it keeps me busy and my nephew likes it too so that always a plus gotta keep the little kids entertained

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this app. It was awesome the first time I played it. You can groom the horse. And much much more.
B004UID2LC|5.0|So far I have downloaded 80 songs using this app. Paying for all the songs I want to listen to was just too exspensive. This app is easy to use and makes it easy to download other songs. I tried other downloading apps but they don't download it TO your device. This app does!! THANK YOU!
B004I744AS|4.0|I really love this app. I love the history lessons as well. Highly recomend. You will be happy with it.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I did not expect JK Rowling's first book outside of her Harry Potter series to be this sad and dark! Definitely an unexpected ending...
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This was a good movie.  It kept my attention but I feel like it never really hit its climax.  There were events that happened and I would think &#34;this is going to get wild&#34; then it wouldn't get to exciting.  But I really liked it.  Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf you can't go wrong.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I have been using my phone as an alarm for a couple years, but it isn't working right now so I looked for a temporary free substitute. This alarm works great and I like the features.
B006LSZECO|5.0|would recommend to anyone who likes a good suspense book. Was hard to put donw once you started it.  Great!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is a great time passer - i found no troubles with installation or running of this game at all.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a joyful and uplifting story  that should appeal  to young and old alike. I really liked it and it  brought a smile to my heart.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This was a good movie, not great but much better than I thought it would be. The special effects were pretty cool.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Exactly what i wanted it to be.easy to use, and simple and to the point. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I highly recommend this game but the price is too much for me so to get games for free go on ur device settings and change it so u can download apps from unknown content and download pandaapp or black mart alpha to get stuff for free
1419704400|4.0|This is a high-quality book and I would recommend it to anyone interested in fashion from today and years past.
0920668372|5.0|Mothers of daughters say, &#34;It's nice.&#34;  Mothers of sons are sobbing at the end!  A very, very touching book.  I highly recommend it.
1442337966|5.0|I really enjoyed The Secret some few years back when it first came out and now am really pleased by Ms. Byrnes latest audio book, so much so that ordered two more as gifts for my two adult children. There is simply no denying the power of gratitude and yet I becomes so easy to forget or overlook being thankful and expressing our appreciation. The Power is all about love, the foundation of all that is, from a human perspective anyway. Love is the desire that creates, the magnet that attracts and the glue that binds all that is. Makes perfect sense to me.<br /><br />I haven't read any other reviews but for me this is a powerful book and reminder of the force, the &#34;power&#34; within us all capable of anything we choose.<br /><br />I have proven in my own life the law of attraction and know full well from personal experience the truth of the message and wisdom contained in The Power. Rhonda Byrne has given us all another wonderful gift.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft rocks t it its so worth the money$$$ when I first got the app it was the only thing I did  and played minecraft is awsome
0345803485|2.0|I got this to see what all the fuss was about.  Terrible writing.  Maybe this appeals to 18 year old girls but I have seen better writing in the Penthouse Forum.
B009CGAUW6|4.0|I owned this game in the 70s and now I bought it for my son. He loves it. Only problem is that I liked the game better when the cards were placed in the rooms. Now the rooms are smaller and the cards dont fit, so it makes for a messy board with all the chits etc. But still a fun game.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Mark of Athena<br />This is the best book I ever read. It is better than the hunger games.<br />I am waiting for the forth book
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Certainly a very good game. Keeps you gripped to the story and you do not want to put it down until it is finished.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Great to have a Blue Ray recording of Zep's concert after so many years of watching their 1975 NYC concert!
1569765677|5.0|After reading this book, I was amazed that the life of one man can be so horrific and yet eye-opening.<br /><br />I was not surprised of the accounts mentioned regarding his incarceration in both juvenile prison and adult prison. What surprised me is how he survived to live and tell this story. The frank brutality, inhumanity and disregard for justice is simply overwhelming.<br /><br />The book is written in the style of what one might term, street conversation. Two friends, hanging out on the stoops of ones house and reminiscing about their lives.<br /><br />From the time Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter was five years old, until his release from prison, the book reads like a story from \\"Hell\\". Some of the incidents in prison with the guards seem to be unbelievable because, if you understand and believe the prison system's mentality, Rubin would have certainly been killed by either the guards or one of the many inmates (attempting to make a name for themselves).<br /><br />The other amazing thing in this book is Rubin's ability to remember so many small details over such a long period of time. The retelling of his life reads as if he somehow recorded every detailed incident and then managed to transcribe it to text. I find it awesome.<br />If one is to believe what is written by Rubin (there are websites that suggest that much of the tales were fabricated), then it certainly is a marvelous book to read, if nothing more than to see how one many managed to survive such an ordeal.<br />I know I could never survive such brutality.<br />Rubin's will to live, survive and be free reminds me yet of the stories of slaves from Africa being transported to the USA or the Caribbean slave trade and somehow managing to survive the trip.<br /><br />The book is like no other book in its intensity, depth and depravity.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as well as the follow-up to this book, entitled,<br />\\"Eye of the Hurricane: My Path from Darkness to Freedom\\" by Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, Ken Klonsky and Nelson Mandela (Jan 1, 2011).<br /><br />This follow-up fills in much of what was left out in the first book. the Sixteenth Round, because it was written while Rubin was in prison after the first trial.
B00APUQT7I|2.0|Sometimes I feel like beating a dead horse --- but then other times I just wish the horse was gone and this is one of those times.  My kids seemed to enjoy it, sortof.
0811826848|5.0|Every Beatles fan or collector needs to have this wonderful book in their collection.  It has something for everyone...and even though I've seen the pictures and heard all the stories before...it's nice to have them all again in one book.
B00138KJY0|5.0|There are quite a few classics on this album (e.g., &#34;Off the Wall,&#34; &#34;I Can't Help It,&#34; &#34;Rock With You.&#34; This is definitely a must-have for any true Michael Jackson fan!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did not think I was going to like the book and it was a total page turner....I could not put the book down!! Can't wait to read the next two
1439152799|4.0|A young woman's mother receives a lost letter in the mail from 50 years prior, and so begins a mystery she simply must sort out. She discovers her mother had been evacuated during WWII from London to the country to Milderhurst Castle, in the company of 3 rather eccentric sisters. Meeting the elderly sisters - whose father just happens to have been the author of her favorite novel when she was a child - intrigues her even more.<br /><br />This story jumps around quite a bit and, for me, that made it just a bit confusing at times, but I still enjoyed it. There were times when I felt it was a bit long and could have benefited from a better job of editing (hence the 4 stars), but still the journey was a good one. There is a good mystery here and it was enjoyable to sort it out.<br /><br />One thing that truly irked me was the names given to the characters. The sisters names are Persephone, Seraphina, and Juniper. With the first two nicknamed Percy and - truly - Saffy. Really?? I kept really that last one as Taffy. And Juniper? A real stretch for the names. Whatever happened to Elizabeth and Ann and Mary? Anyway, beyond the names and the bit of length, I enjoyed the author's storytelling ability and her use of language. She kept entertained and engaged and wanting to know what was coming next!
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Case Logic makes a very good product. Pricing is low, so this manufacturer is the best value available. Nice bags !
B009B8YZKS|4.0|For a low budget film, this is actually very well done.  It is slow, but with a tense ending. Master Chief does not have a big role...but he's there and its cool. :-)  Oh...the Covenant are amazing too.
B00968TI64|5.0|Finally, after hearing the improvement in sound on the Holy Diver 24K cd release, this one lives up to the audio enhancements. A killer record now sounding oohh, so much better
B000LX00RY|5.0|One of my all time favorite movie. You cannot go wrong with Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway, definitely watch this if you like those actresses.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Is this the most well written series? No. But is it entertaining? Yes. I couldn't put these books down and appreciated the fact that there was a beautiful love story. There is a lot of smut in these books but that is exactly what I was expecting. I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen and read the trilogy over a long weekend. This book is not for everyone but as long as you have the right expectations from these books, you will be happy you read them.
B000FZETIO|5.0|No, but seriously, who? This movie is called a cult classic for a reason. I should have bought like 8 copies so when I play them to their deaths I can just swap out the next one.
1451629184|5.0|I read this book cover-to-cover, looked at the pictures, etc., etc., etc., and EVEN AFTER I READ IT, I STILL can't get over how Jaycee and her two lovely daughters had survived this 18-year ordeal! I can't get over the fact that Jaycee had been held against her will for 18 years, I can't get over the fact that she'd been repeatedly raped, was forced to go through the traumatic, painful ordeal of giving birth to her two girls in that makeshift backyard prison she'd been in (no doctors, no epidural, NO NOTHING!!!), and I DEFINITELY can't get over the fact that she'd had to raise her two daughters in that pig's sty squalor of a backyard!<br />Through it all, I KNOW Jaycee NEVER, EVER forgot the content, happy life she used to live, how much her mother, sister, and aunt really loved her and how she was missing them! I also know she LOVED going to school and she was missing all her school friends. That poor girl REALLY missed out on a lot!!! She never got to grow up with her baby sister Shayna, she never learned to drive or got her driver's license at 16, she never graduated at 18--and by the time she reached the age of 21, she was still under that pervert, Phillip Garrido's control--I think she was just so scared of him, and he brain-washed her all those years, she just couldn't muster up the courage to escape soon enough. I also blame the authorities for not helping her out soon enough, too--that is, until that fateful day when  they were at that one college-church campus, when those lady campus cops intervened: These observant ladies could tell something was up, because it was like the two young girls were under Phillip spell, just as Jaycee herself was--there was something about the behavior of the girls and the  monotone, robotic the sound of their voices that aroused their suspicion, so they reported this to Phillip's parole officer, and then they ALL wound up in the police station the very next day. How stupid Phillip and Nancy were to foolishly think that they'dbring Jaycee and both her children in, and nothing wouldn't happen!!! HA! HA! HA! THAT was the wonderful, blessed day that Jaycee was finally able to take her own name back, reunite with her family again, be a REAL mother to her two girls, and start a brand-new chapter in life!<br />What Jaycee lacked over the last 18 years, she was able to make up for it by getting to know her family again, getting her GED, quickly obtaining her driver's license and learning to drive (a total, complete stranger provided Jaycee the driver's license, her sister, Shayna actually taught her how to drive, and social services and the authorities surprised her with the incredible gift of a brand-new car!!!). They even provided her and the girls with a nice, new house at an undisclosed location.<br /><br />In summary, I can figure out only one thing: I think the authorities felt SO BAD (the police chief publicly issued a heart-felt apology, saying something along these lines: &#34; We have let you down AND we have let the whole public down--we are SO SORRY it took this long to find her, we've kicked ourselves for it, and WILL CONTINUE to kick ourselves for it.&#34;), and that's why they did all these unusually special things for Jaycee and the girls. They were feeling extremely guilty for all the negligence on their part in this Jaycee Dugard kidnapping case. Here's hoping and praying that NOTHING LIKE THIS EVER, EVER HAPPENS AGAIN!!!!! I personally think Phillip Garrido should get the death penalty for every despicable, sickening thing he'd ever done to her! As much as Jaycee may love her daughters, I'm sure deep down inside, she probably gets sickening reminders and bad memories of how Phillip had so grotesquely immorally done her wrong all those years, especially now that one of her daughters probably LOOKS like him! Now Jaycee has to live with this for the rest of her life! All three of them may even have to undergo psychiatric counseling for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />But allthings considered, they all seem to be doing well; the girls were doing real good in readjusting to their new surroundings, they've been getting all the help and support they could ever possibly need, and things are real good for them now. They've ALL developed a real tight bond with their own REAL family, and hopefully they will hold on to that tight, sweet bond for life!
034580404X|2.0|So this was a gift for my girlfriend and so I had to ask how she felt about it. She replied that the mystery was good, but the sex scenes were predictable and even boring after there first few.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it because it is so realistic and you can stroke it and play with it and clean up after it as if it were there.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Helps me relax since I have condition -constant ringing in my ears.  Also helps block out my husband's snoring.  Makes a big difference at night since I'm a chronic insomic and I don't like taking any sleeping aids.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I had missed the first episode of OUaT and so I got this so I could see what I missed. I have not missed a single episode since. This is the type of stories I read. With all the hub-bub in recent years this genre is really coming to the forefront. With all the bad programming on TV it is nice to escape into some fantasy instead of watching stupid reality garbage...by the way if you think reality tv is real you need your head examined.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Love it and have seen it on TV many times and I decided to own it to ad it to my collection of favorite movies.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved the book, very easy read and not too 'over the top' like some of the novels in the past that have described seals and their lives and missions.
B006LSZECO|4.0|As I started reading Gone Girl I was thinking this is going to be just another run of the mill story but as I got into it it became more intriguing.  I didn't always find  it cohesive but I did enjoy it and was eager to find how it ended. The ending wasn't all it could have been though so perhaps a sequel is in the works.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was a quick read I couldn't put down. I enjoyed Gone Girl a bit more, but this was still good. A little slow in spots, with a good twist at the end.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|Not sure what I expected for $5 you will want to start the film a while before you are ready to sit down and watch.
B00633W614|5.0|I read the first two books of the The Clifton Chronicles and am awaiting the 3rd.  I'm afraid I'll forget what has happened if it doesn't come out soon!
B000683VI4|4.0|Added it to my collection, but haven't had an excuse to watch the movie again and again so I can only assume the DVD will hold out long term.
0385344333|5.0|Reacher, Reacher, Reacher,  Let me tell you how I met my man...<br />It all started with \\"The Killing Floor\\". We met at a Bookstore, you know those brick and mortar places they used to have? He was large and slightly rumpled, we went for a ride and as he folded himself into my car, I couldn't help but wonder...who was this guy & can I have more some please?<br /><br />I don't know what it is about this character that knocks me sideways.... Maybe somehow I know I would be safe with a guy like him at my side. A large, ex-military, slightly rumpled, slightly handsome \\"every man\\" kinda guy who carries a toothbrush in his pocket, Unless you get in his way that is.<br />Reacher roams from town to town hitchhiking across the country & we get snippets of his past and present life up until now and some how this is enough but, we never really know where he is going or why, all I know is I Would follow Reacher... to any town. Anywhere. Anytime.<br /><br />This is the 17th book in this series and I can honestly say this book is just as thrilling, page turning, and \\"heart-swooning\\" as the first one!<br /><br />We start out with two men in black suits following slightly behind a man in a green coat who goes into a concrete bunker, those two men come out but, the man in the green coat never does make it out...alive. And so starts the manhunt for the killers.<br /><br />Reacher is on a freezing cold Nebraska highway hitching a ride to Virginia with a broken nose well into the night when he eventually gets picked up by a car with two men in front and a woman in back, and Reacher has yet again, unwittingly stumbled into trouble. With the help of special agent Julia Sorenson who has been called in on the case they eventually find and thrillingly punish the bad guys.<br /><br />Let go of the Tom Cruise thing people! Lee had nothing to do with who plays his character in his books. Look, there is just no one in all of Hollywood land who could ever play my man so, get over it...:)
B000NTPDSW|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you're either a sheltered child (In which case, you can't buy this because your parents won't let you use the internet) or you're Amish. In which case, you should have someone put on a play of movies I and II. Because they're amazing.<br /><br />At first, I thought one of the discs was defective, but it turns out, it played fine but was Godfather III.<br /><br />So, buy it despite Godfather III. I and II are amazing enough to warrant owning the collection.

1616550414|5.0|I won't write overly long reviews. I will instead write the advantages over the Japanese version and why you should get this book.<br /><br />-Larger overall size, which allows for more space in the book and fuller displays of concept art, compared to the Japanese version.<br /><br />-Fully translated notes from the development staff of all games, as well as introductory notes from creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma.<br /><br />-A prequel manga to Skyward Sword drawn by Zelda veteran Akira Himekawa.<br /><br />And now the why's:<br /><br />-This is the ultimate source on all things Zelda related until Skyward Sword.<br />-It features a fully translated, official Zelda timeline.<br />-Beautiful, hardcover book with a gorgeous cover by Dark Horse.<br />-It makes the perfect gift for a friend or mate/spouse.<br />-It's Zelda, it's Amazon and it sells at the time of this writing for less than 20 bucks approximately. Do you need a reason?<br /><br />This is a great gift I just got. GET IT.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I think i would prefer to see more of Mike Ross' mind at work ... but right now the story line within the &#34;office&#34; is working ... the personal lives of Ross isn't really necessary .... It would be nice to see the personal life of jessica and donna .. ??<br /><br />and yes, Rachel and Mike should get together ...
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I had fun with this game but twice when I was at a fairly high level the game started over from the beginning.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|If I have hours and hours to fill would be a good read with all the details.  Nice blend of mystery and coastal living but had lots of skip pages.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This was a wonderful story on time. And  how we need to take our time in life and not rush things, because  time does fly by all to fast in this day and age. It's a nice an  quick read as well
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As an older reader I love Riordans books because they deal with the Gods of Greece, Rome, and Egypt.<br /><br />The only drawback is waiting on the new book, I like the new characters and new locations.  Now hurry up with books 4 and 5!!<br />:)
B00992CF6W|5.0|omg best app!  Big fan of minecraft but the amazon store needs the update.  Does anyone know how to download maps like skyblock?
B006LSZECO|4.0|A little slow in places, but overall a fun read that keeps pulling you to the end. More than once during the story I found myself saying &#34;Wow, I didn't see that coming&#34;.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book was recommended to me by my daughter, who loved it and couldn't put it down. I enjoyed it and even though the ending was predictable, I had to keep reading to see if it did actually turn out the way I thought it would.<br />An enjoyable, credible tear jerker, where one can empathise with many of the strongly built characters.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|I bought this as a replacement DVD, the one I had been using in my classroom was stolen. My kids and I love the mix of Shakespeare with modern things.

B00AVASSZ8|4.0|José James does it again, a little bit more jazzy with a little less electronic influence than &#34;Black Magic&#34;, an all around solid effort from a great talent.
B009OWGMYI|5.0|So, It's Two Decades of Love Metal, meaning You're Getting A LOT of Their Old Songs, But for the Price, *which ends TODAY!! (1/31)* It's def worth it. I Love it. A lot of the songs on this album are my all time favorites. If you're a HIM die hard, like me (three tattoos for them lol), you MUST own it :D

B0019O6IWU|5.0|The premiss of the book is excellent<br />It is certainly a healthy way to communicate. It is clearly written and concise but very difficult to implement in daily interactions . I would like to attend a workshop on this topic as I think a hands on learning experience would be very helpful

B0020BUWX2|5.0|Read this and other reviews at [...].<br /><br />Even though this book came out years ago, I am just now reading it - after reading and falling so DEEPLY IN LOVE with Gayle's Just One Day. I knew after I finished that book, I had to read her others. She has such a gift for words that her ability to pull you into a story and make you inexplicably feel is unreal. This was one-hundred percent the case with If I Stay. Told between the past and present, in a series of back stories, seventeen year old Mia watches as her loved ones come and and go to her bedside in the ICU - her body unconscious, but her mind very present...from the sidelines. And now she apparently has a choice to make. Does she stay? Or go?<br /><br />{{Sometimes you make choices in life and sometimes choices make you.}}<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much about the story, because that's just not fair. What I can say, though, is that the way this story is told is so different from what I've read before and it's just now that I've finished it, that I realize just how different it was. We start in the present, but then there's the accident. And while there's still plenty in the present, it's all told from Mia's POV, and she's currently in a coma in the ICU (in grave condition, the doctors say). We see family, friends and her boyfriend, Adam, all shuffle in and out. We learn about her relationships with them through the stories she tells from her past.<br /><br />Every supporting character that we came across was beautifully crafted. I loved Mia's parents, and her little brother Teddy, but also her best friend, Kim, her boyfriend, Adam, and her parents' friends, Willow and Henry. It was great to get the backstories on these characters and actually experience learning about them, rather than just being told. Life's all about choices, and I so appreciated the way that Gayle connected this to the actual world, as well as this world Mia is currently living in. Before the accident, she had a choice to make - stay in Oregon, or head for NY (to Juilliard); stay with her boyfriend, or risk the breakup to focus on music.<br />There's always a choice. In everything we do. Some are just bigger than others.<br /><br />{{\\"Life might take you down different roads. But each of you gets to decide which one to take.\\"}}<br /><br />There were many instances where we'd see some one-on-one interaction with a particular supporting character and the hospitalized Mia. Being able to see that through her \\"in-between\\" self put such a different spin on the story, but was also so amazing to read. It's something I can't help but wonder about - when you die, or when you might die, for instance, do you have a choice? Do you know what's going on? It's crazy that you can't know for sure, until you're in that place - and at that point, you can't yell back, \\"hey, yes, I do know what's going on!\\"<br /><br />{{All this business about medically induced comas is just doctor talk. It's not up to the doctors. It's not up to the absentee angels. It's not even up to God who, if He exists, is nowhere around right now. It's up to me.}}<br /><br />This book was definitely a tear jerker for me. Not necessarily because it was so gut-wrenchingly sad, although it certainly had those moments, but more than that, I cried because it was so powerful. The way that Gayle wrote this story made you feel so much and because of that, I often found myself wiping away tears.<br /><br />I LOVED Mia's boyfriend, Adam, so much, so when I went to pick up the second book, Where She Went, last night, I was super excited to see it told from his POV. I can't wait to get inside his head and see what he thinks of all that's happened...and how's he dealt with it, or as the case may be, how he's NOT dealt with it.<br /><br />This is certainly a 5 star story for me, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, powerful story about love, loss and the choices we make in life.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I think it is a bit childish for me and I would like to seemore games geared to adults like card games.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like the game; however I don't appreciate the advertisements before each hand.  I didn't realize ads were part of the program.
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|This set will sell itself. For any Original Star Trek Fan from the 1960's on it's a must !  Both the original episodes versions and the new remastered versions with the new special effects all in high def- along with many bonuses and extras it's a Star Trek  fan's dream to own the original series in the best possible way ever available. 'Nuff said !!

B008XOXGCO|4.0|I love the Script, and this is another great album, but I still think their 2nd album was the best.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Read this and other reviews at [...]<br /><br />HERE IS MY INITIAL REVIEW::<br /><br />Blew. My. Mind.<br />I love Adam.<br />I love Mia.<br />I love Gayle Forman.<br /><br />& here's what I came up with a day later! :)<br /><br />I loved the first book in this duet, If I Stay, so much. And of course, because of how it ended, I KNEW I had to start reading Where She Went immediately. I'll admit, I wasn't sure how I'd feel about a couple of aspects of this book - the first being that it was three years later. That seemed like a lot of time, but I hoped it would work out; second, it being told from Adam's POV. I loved Mia, and I didn't want to not hear from inside her head. I shouldn't have worried about either of these things because they were complete non-issues. I one-hundred percent loved Adam's POV, and as for the time frame, it was completely essential to the story.<br /><br />From what we knew of Adam in the first book, I was pretty in love with him. I thought he was perfect for Mia, and couldn't imagine them ever having to part ways. His monologue to her at the end of If I Stay had me wanting to pass out. So when we first see him again in Where She Went, I'm sad to see how tortured he is. He's hit it big with his band, but of course, with the skyrocketed fame, comes the paparazzi, the other media, the touring and just lots of expectations. And really, he's just not the same since he lost Mia. He's not kept tabs on her, but he does know she's in NY, and after a whole lot of happenstance, he stumbles upon an advertisement outside Carnegie Hall - for a showcase Mia is presenting - that same night. He decides, for whatever reason, that he should see this show. He knows it won't change the fact that she left him (and really, he knows he told her she could - although she couldn't know he told her that), but for some reason, he's drawn to seeing her perform.<br /><br />{{But I'd do it again. I know that now. I'd make that promise a thousand times over and lose her a thousand times over to have heard her play last night or to see her in the morning sunlight. Or even without that. Just to know that she's somewhere out there. Alive.}}<br /><br />After the show, Mia requests to see Adam, and from there they spend this amazing twenty-four hours together. Things are awkward, and real, and plenty is avoided at first. I loved this aspect to the story, because it wasn't some \\"falling into old habits\\" routine that you might typically see. It was quite the opposite. They both had some serious hurts from the past, and while they wanted to spend this little time together, Adam eventually couldn't avoid the elephant in the city.<br /><br />{{There are so many things that demand to be said. Where did you go? Do you ever think about me? You've ruined me. Are you okay? But of course, I can't say any of that.}}<br /><br />When I think of this story, what I can't get over is the fluidity of it all. The entire 260 pages takes place over the course of twenty-fours, but nothing feels rushed or forced. There's just this liquid movement with the whole thing. You move along with Adam and Mia. You feel his pain, her hesitancy and his sadness that this is all they have together. I loved that the awkwardness between them was so palpable. I felt like a voyeur in some of their moments together. That is great writing. {Another fav part: the lyrics! At the beginning of the present chapters, were parts of Adam's lyrics, written after Mia left. These were AMAZING and uncovered so much raw emotion. I was beyond impressed.}<br /><br />I loved that, similarly to If I Stay, there are parts of the past mixed in to the present. This is how we learn more about Adam's life - both with and aside from Mia. I thought these parts were absolutely amazing for the simple fact that we got even more about the Hall family that we didn't in book one, but also so much on who Adam is, and just how much losing Mia's family devastated his life, as well. And also what he thought of hisrelationship with Mia. I think they both had such different ideas about their \\"young love\\" and I loved experiencing those times through his eyes, unlike just through Mia's in the first book. As for the loss of the Halls, they've both dealt with their pain in their own ways. No matter the consequences it's caused.<br /><br />{{\\"I know what I did to you was so wrong, but at the time it also felt so necessary to my survival. I don't know if those two things can both be true, but that's how it was.\\"}}<br /><br />I can't say any more on the plot because it's best to experience this in all it's rawness and realness, but I will say that it is nothing short of absolutely beautiful. I cannot recommend Gayle's books enough. With this series, it's about so much loss, but about sort of emerging from that wreckage the best you can. And who you might become on the other side. Please, do yourself a favor, and pick up this series. It's breathtaking, heart stopping, and just so, so astonishingly beautiful. There's very little writing like it.<br /><br />{{I've come to realize there's a world of difference between knowing something happened, even knowing why it happened, and believing it.}}relationship with Mia.

B00AE4OGCU|5.0|these books are well worth the read! I honestly couldn't put them down and so many twists in this incredible story. So well priced for all three books worth every cent!
0525478817|5.0|\\"Pain demands to be felt.\\" That line drew me into this book, and along with the excellent ratings and critical acclaim, I ordered the hardback version of this book. I almost never buy new copies of fiction books, as I don't consider them in my budget as I will likely just read them once. I'm not sorry that I invested the money in this one.<br /><br />I'm an adult and loved it. If you're an adult and on the fence about this book, read it. It's wonderful. Great characters, story lines and writing. So many quote-worthy lines too! I doubt you'll be disappointed.
B005H29GSI|4.0|If this is your kids' first Angry Birds game, you will likely have fun with it.  It is easy to setup and watching birds going all over the place kept my kids entertained for days.  Adults can also join the fun and will likely end up entertained as well.<br /><br />However, there is nothing fundamentally different from this game compared to other Angry Birds games (except the the Star Wars one).  The thing you have to consider is which birds you want to be playing with because that would depend on the game you purchase.  Otherwise, the way things work is pretty much the same.<br /><br />This is now our third Angry Birds game.  We have Angry Birds Space and Star Wars.  We began playing the game the way it was supposed to but then we ended up making our own structures with the kids.  This has helped the little guys figure out about how things balance, what parts you should hit to cause more blocks to fall, etc.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|This is a great adaptation of the book Killer Angels by Michael Shara.  I read the book in the early 90s and just watched the movie for the first time.  Excellent.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read for anyone who loves a good romance...many twists throughout the book...left me speecheless. Will most likely read again!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|3d is the way to go... the eye candy is great.. the movie is solid sci-fi... its for people who want to be entertained and immersed in the environment of the film.... its not for anyone that liked 'emma'.....
B0091REZMW|5.0|it does go a little slow as far as useing the energy fast and it taking a long time for it to build back up.
1616550414|5.0|This product is SPECIAL! Any Legend of Zelda fan NEEDS THIS BOOK!!  Just got mine today and let me tell you, only by looking at the cover I instantly fell in love with this. This is a must have.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game. This game is super fun and presents some difficulty and challenges in order to keep you on your game. Many great improvements from its predecessor. I love the new location, the rope glide, and the ability to use different characters with special skills. Best sequel ever!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Had seen the movie in many different versions many times.  First time reading the book, excellent book.  I have just started reading classic novels recently and this one the first one I read.  Glad I did.  Well worth the time.
0345803485|5.0|THE THIRD BOOK WAS EXCITING & JOYFUL. i REALLY LOVE ALL THREE OF THE BOOKS & I HOPE SHE WRITES A FOURTH ONE SOON!!!!!!!!!!!
B004EPZ06G|5.0|This is a great comedy that always has me laughing anytime I watch it! I will admit it isn't as good as the first movie, but it's still great!
B002RVCD0U|3.0|It was a good movie ..........could have been a little longer I think .....cool special effects ......more TnA would have been nice
2253150711|5.0|apres tant d'annees a entendre parler d'ameli nothomb, je me decide enfin a lire un de ces livres. et c'est avec surprise que jai termine celui ci. j'aime son esprit de repartie
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is outstanding!  Love, love, love the characters, the plot, the scenery, and everything about it!  Buy it!
B0007TKNII|5.0|I LOVED this rendition of the famed Phantom. Gerard Butler brings sexy to the Phantom. And Emmy Rossum brings such an innocence to Christine Daae. Broadway musicals are great and when someone makes one a movie they better get it right. And though Director Joel Schumacher takes some liberties it is spot on perfection. He got it right!
0345803507|5.0|This book here will make you want to be with your mate a whole more. I was very interesting and erotic.
B0039NK0LE|5.0|I bought it as a gift and it came very quickly! This movie is a great movie if you're looking to laugh!
B00B0NDF26|4.0|I am one of those devote Tegan and Sara fans. There new album was a bit of a shock. I have always loved their lyrics in their songs and this one is no different. It is very poppy and I hope they get the recognition they deserve. It feels like they are leaving neverland and all the lost boys (or girls) in the forest. I really like &#34;I'm not Your Hero&#34; and &#34;How Come You Don't Want Me&#34;. The album is easy to listen to and it is upbeat. I hope the world will love them now as much as I have. Whichever direction they go, we will always have the magic of knowing them from the begining.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Did not work, I've tried everything to get it to work, but not compatible to Samsung Chromebook...so I uninstalled it
B000001GQP|4.0|This performance, overseen by Orff himself, really is a great job by the musicians. The fact that the original master doesn't quite allow it to be an audiophile recording doesn't get in the way of the enjoyment of the composition.
0765325950|5.0|To all the Wheel of Time fans that have been waiting for this book, you won't be disappointed. 909 Pages of battle scene is exactly what I was expecting and couldn't have been more pleased
0345803493|5.0|I like this book even more & it was also very steamy and very very very hot! Wow what a book.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|This movie is a great funny movie I can watch over and over again! It also came very quickly In the mail!
0446554995|5.0|I could not put this book down.  These authors are awesome, and I can't wait for their next book.  Characters unforgettable, the plotting tight and suspenseful and a twist every time the reader turns a page.  Just when I thought I had a handle on the outcome, wham, they hit me again.  I am hoping they will follow up with the &#34;twin&#34; aspect.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|My daughter loved it. It's perfect for her dollhouse and she plays with it just about every day. Thank you
B000001GQH|4.0|This CD contains some fantastic music very well-performed and is thus quite enjoyable. On a reference-quality stereo system, the age of the original master is apparent, with a somewhat diminished dynamic range and stereo imaging/soundstage, but the music does not disappoint.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is even better than the original wich is awsome now if only they made a third!!!!!!!!! please tell me they are
B00006LFGD|5.0|we bought this as part of a 60th bday gift.  she is a Streisand fan & loved adding this to her collection
B004EPZ08O|5.0|I love this movie series and had to buy this one to complete my set, it came quick and is great to watch!
B009GED3HS|5.0|as usual good stuff from the show. relationships are seemingly complicated and tangled as usual. certainly recommend to any &#34;how I met your mother&#34; fans
B000YPUF9W|5.0|I loved the condition of the Used movie, it was pretty much brand new, but I got the first film in the mail, not &#34;Extinction&#34; so now I have 2 copies of the original but I wasn't upset cause I planned on getting another for my girlfriend, so I got a mix up but condition and service was fantastic, glass half full.
B0001WGDX0|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this set of recordings! Beethoven's symphonies stand apart from the rest of his works (in my humble opinion) not because everything else he wrote was second-rate, but because his symphonies are so good. And these recordings under Bernstein's baton do a great job of capturing the emotional power of Beethoven that make his symphonies so famous and unequalled. A live performance of these compositions is an awe-inspiring experience, and coming home to these recordings after a performance doesn't disappoint. You can return to these recordings over and over again and say, &#34;I remember when the orchestra got to this part!&#34; They are equally satisfying on an emotional level (Beethoven gets credit here), technical level (by the musicians and recording engineers), and musical level (kudos to Bernstein). Along with Boston Baroque's recording of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, this is a CD set to grab and run out of a burning music library (if you ever find yourself in that unfortunate situation, and have just a moment to rescue some music).
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game, rather large but graphics are brilliantly done and game play easy to pick up. Well done. Would recommend to anyone who likes hidden object games.
B001W63DY6|5.0|we bought this as part of a 60th bday gift.  she is a Streisand fan & loved adding this to her collection
B000P0J09W|5.0|The Goonies is a classic movie you can watch an endless amount of times! It shipped fast and I received it very quickly, no complaints here!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love playing temple run but the problem with the second one is that it is so detail on graphics it causes the game to lag and make you miss jumps or turns without it responding fast enough so you end up dying without meaning too.  Also it sometimes doesn't want to start the game so I ended up having to uninstall and then re-install in order for it to start again.  Otherwise it is fantastic to play.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Imangi does it again. Temple Run 2 is absolutely solid. improved graphics, options for customization and powers. Increased difficulty (twists, bends, hils, etc.) provides an improved challenge over the old left, right, up and down of the original. My biggest love for this is that you can choose to purchase coins and what-not but it is easy enough to earn any of the perks or powers on your own. Looks absolutely beautiful on Fire HD 8&quot;. Take the cursed idol if you DARE!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am always prepared for the day's weather. Accurate for my area. Keep track of weather where I am traveling to.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I will definitely begin buying more Invicta watches after this initial purchase, I really cant say anything bad about it. Is better than my 300 dollar Bulova, and it just screams out buy me.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I love the book. Ken Follett did and amazing job putting together so much information into the lives of the characters and make it flow between their relationships. It was hard to keep reading at times because of the so well done description of the facts. I was happy to see the characters from the first book still be involved on the second, and I can't wait to read the third book to continue with the saga.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I love this movie it's a classic! The plot is great! Action packed and can be watched an endless amount of times!
B0045EA1P6|5.0|this was my favorite band of 2012 and I even got to see them live at the end of the year. once their single started playing on the radio I wanted to hear more of their stuff and this album didn't disappoint. lots of good upbeat tracks.
B004UID2LC|4.0|well this is a great app but after a while it like wont download any more so I uninstalled the app and it worked but then it started acting up again so I uninstslled it again and it did not work so now I have to find a new music/video app that blows!!!!!!!!!

B005VPRET4|5.0|I know you must be laughing why I buy for my niece that is not 6 years old when the product said so. Well, I thought I could advance my niece but it didnt works. I have to sit and play with her and explain. So personal opinion, this is a GREAT gift but make sure they are old/mature in their thinking before getting them as gift. Lesson learned. LOL!!!
B002ZG980U|5.0|This is an excellent movie! I think I would call it one of a kind! You really have to pay attention and follow along, but you can watch it an endless amount of times!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|More fun and entertaining than I thought it would be.  My daughter just loves this game and I have to admit, I do too!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The story itself would not be one I'd read.  The point of view changes everything and makes this story three dimensional.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|My dad thinks Avatar is one of the best graphic movies ever made, so when he upgraded his TV to the 3D SmartTV I of course had to get the 3D Avatar movie for him. He loves it! Avatar just isn't Avatar without it being 3D & the price is perfect, it also showed up way before the estimated delivery date as always, thanks Amazon!

B008602KQI|4.0|Had heard some good things but never saw in the theater. Ordered . Watched with some friends and we all liked it a lot better than we had the Twilight saga. Anxious to see where they go with the next one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|uh I heard the new update came today but my minecraft game on my kindle didn't update. why isn't it updating? please answer. thank you!
1932735410|5.0|Worth every hour and was the reason that I was able to pass the PMP exam. Rita provides an amazing level of information and helped to really understand the concepts and be able to take the exam. She lets you in on all of the tricks and provides challenging exercises and questions. Highly recommend and would strongly suggest using this book over Andy Crowe.
B000P8V8EY|5.0|the greats of the great comidie i am not a big fan at all when it comes to scarie or much other things so i was searching movies when i cam across this i thought that it was a little bit much for this old miovie but no it was great the kid was cute and well its adam sandler...... thats all
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Not much to say here.. downloaded this on my Kindle Fire just to have a backup alarm in case one of our other alarms dies or gets knocked under the bed etc etc.. all I can say is it works! The advertisement is kind of annoying, and it always saying &#34;UPGRADE UPGRADE&#34; is annoying as well, but it's not an app that's used a lot, it serves its purpose :).
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is great to keep in touch with people farther away and to keep up with the<br />younger people in your life.  They move with the speed of light!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun and kept me entertained.  I liked how easy it was to train your horse to do competitions.  I also like the option of buying more horses
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|What a great show - each episode tells a new story.  Acting is great also.  Can't wait to watch the next  episode.
141694737X|5.0|My 13 month old received this book for Christmas. I thought it was cute, but she is a HUGE fan of books that allow her to do something...lift a flap, feel a texture, make a noise or point to pictures as she grows her recognition of words. This book she can literally go through 5+ times at a time. She just flips back to the start of the book after getting to the last page. She loves all the flaps, and we have noises that accompany most of these so she also enjoys hearing & trying to imitate those :-) This is a really great book for little ones! The flaps don't seem super thick, but after reading through this book a gazillion times so far, it still looks like new. Sturdier than I would've expected and she doesn't have to struggle to lift these flaps like some of her other books. Maybe this is why all the flaps are still intact & not starting to fray like the other flap books...? Highly recommend!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|i think that if you like music sports or any other thing you can listen to then get this because it has all the games and lots of good music i myself like country and if you like new country look for jake fm
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just finished this book and it was excellent, with twists and turns in the story to keep the reader intrigued and involved and emotionally charged.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|The Lucky One was fast moving, and a great story! All the characters seemed to come alive!<br />I can't wait for the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you have no idea what minecraft is, I recommend you try it. It is my favorite game of all time!<br />NOTE: If you like minecraft pocket edition, you'll love it for your Xbox and PC!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 Is the best game ever what's not to like about it. I am so good at it and its easy
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was an exceptional tale about beating the odds and I believe ever word that was written. Sometimes the impossible is possible
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app the horse is so alive and doesn't want to get a chance to get a horse?!?!?!
B004W4CK44|5.0|Anyone who likes film soundtracks will love this. It has a great mix of pieces that range from folk to contemporary classical/experimental and indie rock.
B003GEDLW6|5.0|I LOVE this album. It sounds so amazing, and the collaborations are incredible. My favorite is &#34;The Fountain&#34; with Steven Wilson. His voice is incredible. On another note, I like the theme of water/ocean shown in this album. I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so AWESOME its wayyyy better than temple run one or two you gotta get this game you will LOVE it I promes get it and what's the best thing its FREEE free makes every thing better!!!!!!:)
B00425S1H8|5.0|This was a second try purchase. The first one did not work fro my application. Second try was the charm in this case. Go for it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Kept my attention. Liked the concept and the reality of parental love. The ending was somewhat of  a surprise to me. Enjoyed this book very much.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book I like Nicholas sparks but sometimes his books seem to drag on. This book was fast paced I also enjoyed the suspense. Read this book you won't regret it.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|We enjoyed the singing and the cast. The story is predictable, but in a lovable way. Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and Brittany Snow are great.
B00B0NDF26|3.0|I find this album to be very boring and generic.  I have always been a Tegan and Sara fan and i will keep buying their albums and going to their shows.<br /><br />I just cant seem to get into this one.  I have been on the other hand playing through the other albums quite a bit.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This was a fun app.  It is better to play on my kindle than on my cell...but i'm so over it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I'm going to buy it now. I was so addicted last night I couldn't put it down. I was disappointed when the demo was over.
0307593525|5.0|Julia was truly amazing!  It is a fabulous cookbook for anyone who appreciates fine food!  I was impressed also with the condition the package came to me...Brand spanking new and covered in plastic!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This is exactly like the 1st temple run no changes its actually not as good too and I would recommend not getting it and buy the original
B008476HBM|5.0|pride an  prejudice was by far the BEST book of read this year. It's absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!I recommend EVERYONE to read it,especially if you're into romance
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've always wanted a horse, so i got this app. i love it! its like having a real horse. every hose lover should get it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Let me say it's really not the best writing but it's great storytelling.  I couldn't put it down and initially reread the series 3 times.
1575666286|5.0|I would suggest this book for anyone who is interested in juicing or healing themselves naturally of any typr of diseases.
B004AQR29C|4.0|This is a typical action film. with romance. It is the actors that make it enjoyable. I like it enought to think about checking up next one
B0065FFMR0|5.0|This show caught me off guard.  I was just expecting a typical haunted house story where a family moves into a house previously populated by many deaths.  It was quickly apparent though that this series goes way beyond that, entering into quirky, odd, bizarre territory.  All of the characters in AHS are exactly that, characters; each with a unique trait many people may be able to identify with, but seeing so many oddball characters gives AHS a certain charm.<br /><br />Connie Britton's character may be the only one who seems to have normal reactions to the goings on.  But before long, even her sanity seems to crumble under the weight of the house's sadistic past.  This show really puts its characters through the emotional ringer, and many times it's difficult to feel sorry for them, but the longer the show goes on, the more understandable the characters' actions become.<br /><br />Ah, and it does have some effective horror in it too, although the show's opening scene complete with a score from Saw composer Charlie Clouser hints at more horror than the show typically delivers.  Instead much of the drama plays out like an episode of Desperate Housewives, but more effectively, and the ghosts enter the picture to sabotage the family's lives every now and then.  The best moments of the show for me were the flashbacks, especially those involving Charles the surgeon and his nagging wife.<br /><br />There's great build up to the big events in the show, as well as some fantastic plot twists I never saw coming.  With such interesting plot devices and increasing drama, it's near impossible not to keep watching to see what happens next.  Thanks so much to Amazon for offering this show free to Prime members.  I can't wait to see all of season 2 in one big marathon.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This is a truly outstanding album! The production is quite elaborate, but the music is still quintessential Tegan and Sara. They still have their unique voices and the lyrics are as amazing as ever. They really know how to take their sound to the next level. The Con and Sainthood were all building up to this amazing  record. It's sooooooooooo good. I've been listening to it on constant repeat. And if you've never seen their &#34;banter&#34; (you can watch it on youtube), you are missing out! They have the funniest sibling dynamics. Not only is their music exceptional and constantly evolving, they are also awesome people!!!!<br />DEFINITELY buy this album (preferably the deluxe version with 2 amazing bonus tracks)!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Second time reading this book and it was just as great this time around.  Moving on to the next book now.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|love that it can stand in multiple ways.  it was a great gift and exactly what my nephew wanted.  I happen to have one in purple and love it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first, reading all of the comments.i didn't like it..but when I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.this is like a modern fairytale for women..is there a Christian grey in real life? Loo..congrats to the writer..way to get the imagination run wild..re-read the book for the 2 nd time now..and will be re- reading till I get tired of it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Brilliant, clever, captivating.. unforgettable. This book was exactly what I was looking for, I stopped reading for awhile and this book brought me right back in.. now I need another equally incredible book to read! Help!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a page turner that I read in a few days. First Colleen Hoover book I have read and I will be reading more from this author.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Let me say it's really not the best writing but it's great storytelling.  I couldn't put it down and initially reread the series 3 times.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Great to have Rebus back and as irreverent as ever. It was also good to see Fox and co of the Complaints incorporated into the story line but viewed from a different perspective.<br /><br />I got a good giggle out of the stolen stapler too.
B00364K6YW|4.0|This movie was excillent. The original 6 disks down to 2. pictire quality is on par. I always enjoyed the movie with it's classic apeal
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Bob was singing and tear gas went off and every one went running. Their eyes and throats were burning from the gas. While all this was going on and Bob's group left the stage; but there Bob Marley was still on stage not even flinching singing and dancing.<br /><br /> He was a singing revolutionary for peace.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Games like this are among my favorites.  There are several levels.  It keeps me busy for hours.  If I can't sleep at night, I just turn on my Kindle and play my favorite game.
B004FEFS5E|4.0|This was an excellent read! I went with the kindle version but wish I would have gone with the actual book. The images are so much better in the book. The images were not as good and they left a little to be desired in the kindle version. I would give the book and content 5 stars however.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I love this app.  I have it on my android so I felt the need to have it here as well.  Good place with centralized and personalized news.
B00AHNTHCM|2.0|This version of Persuasion is my favorite.  I have no complaint about the acting or the story.  The disappointment of not being able to see any picture or have any sound is my complaint.  I went though the process of returning the disc through Amazon and it worked.  I was pleased to get responsive emails and a speedy refund.  Thank you Amazon.
B001CB8NQE|3.0|I loved stargate  and like atlantis but this felt like a cheap fomula series. The actors( not all) seemed to became more who they were than the character. I was disapointed
B0053O89KG|5.0|I'm continuing to enjoy the Castle series. I primarily started watching it because I'm a big Nathan Fillion fan from the Firefly days. That, and I'm a writer myself, so watching shows with writer in-jokes sounded like a solid plan. I've stayed with it because the cast chemistry is amazing, and even when the show is serious for a while, they never lose the fun altogether. The team that puts this show together is doing a great job. Every season that I buy, I burn through like I have to give it back to someone the next day. I'm always sad when there aren't any more. I think that's a pretty good indication that the show is made well.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|If you need something to occupy your mind, this game is it.  Challenging to beat my own time.  I like it
B004KKXMSI|5.0|when i received it the box inside it broken so the discs not stick to it<br />but i am very disapointed
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this series!  This is not my typical genre to read but I couldn't put it down.  I found the ideals to be thought provoking and enjoyed the amount of detail the author used.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Want to feel powerful sadness and be moved beyond belief? READ Les Miz.It is a great story about dynamic characters and the troubles they face.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book . . . could not put it down!  I can not wait to watch the movie now!  Highly recommend!
B0042KA5EK|5.0|I really enjoyed this show's first season. I wasn't sure that I'd be able to, as I was a BIG fan of the Le Femme Nikita show featuring Peta Wilson. That said, I thought they did a great job here, keeping things tense, killing characters unexpectedly, and generally keeping the audience guessing. Maggie Q is pretty amazing, and the rest of the cast does their part. Recommended.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|I was glad th hat I was assigned this or I would have never read it. Audiotape made it more fun
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|a wonderful story of two men , who had compassion, though enemys through war, a German fighter pilot, after doing awesome damage to a B-17 bomber, and the bomber crew lost all capability to defend itself, flew along side and saw the terrible situation these men where in, ecorted the plane through hevely fortified german anti aircraft positions, to where they were able to make back to England, I give the book a very high rating, Jim Ferguson Vet. USAF
B005PK57NU|3.0|love the show.  i happened to be missing this episode on my dvr list and couldn't find it anywhere else.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so easy and convenient. I love it. The best! I will definetely recommended.  Very inspirational and bolessed oportunity through this application.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|EPIC!!!!! I loved the ending! It always had me hooked and made me read more!<br />Thanks to S·Collins for doing this book!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game never fails to keep me entertained,it never gets boring,however to get the new rio version I had to uninstall it and reinstall,loosing all my points and coins.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not what I expected. Sad for it to end though. Several parts of the book were very graphic and others long, drawn out and bland.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great app for all ages. I originally downloaded it for my 5 year old, and now my 8 year old and I are also<br />addicted to it. We have never had any problems with bugs or freezing, it<br />runs smooth on all our different devices. Awesome app!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this series!  This is not my typical genre to read but I couldn't put it down.  I found the ideals to be thought provoking and enjoyed the amount of detail the author used.
B009LH1WLO|4.0|The beginning of the season has scenes from purgatory that are more dramatic and action packed than most of the show's comical roots usually go and i enjoyed it. Benny, a character from purgatory (vamp) adds alot to the interesting story line although the later episodes in season 8 start to get cheesier just as most seasons of this series have done. I love the classic rock intro on alot of the episodes and the comedy aspect is great, but the series has a habit of going off-topic for 2-3 episodes each season and then picking up the main story..........which is boring alot of times. I got the season pass so the some of the later episodes getting cheesy was dissapointing after the great start. I fear the show will eventually lose pace with fans due to this inconsistency in story lines and the general habit of going off the main story so much each season. Overall i'd watch this over gossip girls any day due to the fact that i am a straight male with no homo tendencies, lol.
B006LSZECO|5.0|That book was crazy good. First you think it is the husband then you think maybe the girlfriend then possibly the dad. Then bam oh my goodness. Very good read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game hugely reccommended for horse lover's or anyone out for a fun fast game. I however have two complaints A. on the original kindle fire the loading time can be long or short or sometimes not load at all. B. the friends and newsfeed needs to load faster takes to long. Everything else is fast and works great.
B002CM03PQ|5.0|If you love woodstock as much as i do, than you definitely need this. I have always wanted to see more footage of the festival and with this you get two extra disks of it. I love that they included performances by CCR and The Grateful Dead as well as footage of the mass traffic of people walking to the farm. Its a really great price for everything you get so i highly recommend it.
0061673730|3.0|Haven't finished reading it yet. But appeals to the aging & nostalgic side of me. Good for introspection about getting older and changing sets of values.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this series!  This is not my typical genre to read but I couldn't put it down.  I found the ideals to be thought provoking and enjoyed the amount of detail the author used.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|If you like thrillers you will enjoy Eye of the Needle. There is  terrific suspense.  I could not put it down !!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this game for pc. I have this game for Xbox. And now kindle fire hd I present to you, MC PE. Adventure maps. Survival ass kicker. And now I get a pocket sized experience. Oh and one more thing. I'm a pocket noob so, how do I update MC PE.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You won't be able to put it down.. I cried a couple times.. makes you think about your life and making the most of it.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|I'm not sure how anyone can say this little sharpener really does anything.  I'm pretty much convinced that the blades I've tried it on are now actually duller than before using it.  To convince myself of this, I tried sharpening my kitchen knives with this thing and checked the edge.  Couldn't cut a fart.  Then I tried my new Spyderco Sharpmaker on those same knives and I now have a cut on my left index finger from just slipping a little bit with one of the knives after using the Spyderco.  They will now cut paper with no effort.  I know the Spyder sharpener is more expensive and requires a little bit more work but I can tell you that this Smith sharpener is junk compared to a real sharpener.  Don't waste your money.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I sent a couple of books from my desktop to the Kindle Fire and could not find them after a couple of days except for the ES File Explorer. It is true that I am not thoroughly accustomed to the Fire, and the ES certainly helped.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Let me say it's really not the best writing but it's great storytelling.  I couldn't put it down and initially reread the series 3 times.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This account of the taking of Osama Bin Ladin has the Ring of Truth and accuracy. However, the book is so much more. It details what it takes to become an elite SEAL assigned to DEVGRU and the missions leading up to being selected to serve on that elite SEAL team.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I felt that this book was too medically technical for the average reader. Others I have read exploring this subject have been much more interesting
B003UBTX72|1.0|Very hard and slow read. Couldn't understand Kieth's story half the time. First half of the story or more was brutally boring!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|You should be able to go on the carts sooner and I hate it but I like the rope  I think that is cool
B008476HBM|5.0|I love the classic British romances, but this one most of all. The language is dated and a dictionary is needed to understand fully Miss Austen 's meanings. Many other authors fail to fully satisfy the way this does. Every young woman dreams of her own Mr. Darcy.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I wish I could split my review into two separate parts. The first half I would give about 2 stars. It was just never-ending and was like reading a history lesson rather than a novel. The second half however I would without a doubt give 4-5 stars. That's when it drew me in and I simply could not put it down!!!! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an adventure!!!! I can't wait to read the sequel!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is good you have to save money to get what you won't you dodge trains and you can go very far the farther you go the faster you will go
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game my preschooler loves it and so do i! Would recommend this game to any parent looking for a fun way to entertain their child.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved it ! Great story and the way it was told. One of those books that I just didn't want to put it down. SEALS are just plain BAD A*@'S . We as a country are so blessed to have people like them fighting for us!!! Thank you U.S. Military!!
1619691884|5.0|Loved the Hitch.  This is a beautiful book.  Many thanks.  I really mean that. Quite a product.  I really am enjoying it.  Hope to find more just like it - or if not just like it very similar.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Morrie's lessons are something we should all experience. I have read this book before,but each<br /> time I read it I find something new to learn.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|As a child of 1968, and later a geek, I completely identify with the protagonist in the story<br /><br />If you are not of this age group, the plot, while interesting, will seem obscure<br /><br />If you remember when Tron was first released, and reversing, perpetually, half left in Battlezone was the way to eternal life, buy this book
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Yeah, I have it and it continues the story at Downton Abbey that we have grown to love. Now I am lending it out to other lovers .
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Sure didn't end that way as the cast, the truth of it is wonderful. Was unsure of casting as well, but they each are perfect
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Great story telling, but quite dark.  Not for the faint of heart.  Some light in a lot of darkness.  Appreciated the story telling.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Although most of her songs have been on the radio already, I still like to listen to Adele. She has an amazing voice and I love the way she seems to transmit her emotions into each and every song. I cannot wait for her new material!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The writer has a wonderful sense of humour, and (I'd guess) a technical background<br /><br />The story gallops along, reveling in technical detail when appropriate, and enjoying itself without getting too bogged down<br /><br />Flash Gordon Saturday Matinee in book form
1591396190|3.0|I felt the authors of this book were academic people not salespeople or business owners that implemented the strategy. They were merely observers to the great ideas of companies in the book.  The concept blue ocean strategy is excellent! But I would rather read more from the people implementing the blue ocean strategy then academic author observer.  This book read like a college text book not a motivational book. So good thing I don't have to take a test on this book or write an essay. Blue ocean strategy is the most important concept for any business to know but this book did a weak job at explaining it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|First book where a doctor sees heaven with his neocortex where we have dreams is not working. Gives medical credibility to what he experienced. Interesting reading.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I gaged my rating because of the number of passages I highlighted. Dr Frankl provided 'food for thought' regarding the books title.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is better than the first temple run!<br />It has good graphics and this time in temple run 2 you can slide down a rope.I recommend this app.
B00873GRU4|5.0|A good read, a sci-fi book that doesn't rely on science fiction, but instead uses it for the base scenario, after that it's about the ability to tell a good story, with credible characters in understandable situations
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I stumbled upon this book at a book store, always looking to avoid fantasy book. The Name of the Wind starts off kind of slow but, picks up steam like a roller coaster. There are many characters that I rooted for but, Kvothe came to life the most. I do recommend this book, you just have hang in there to get to the meat and potatoes.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Why does it NEED to disable the key guard ? Some are these permissions area LITTLE suspicious..don't YOU think ????
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is really fun. I love horses, but I don't have my own horse, but when I play this it seems like I have a real horse when I'm playing it! So thank you for the wonderful game!!!!!!! :-)
B00A757EFW|5.0|It is awesome. Love pac-man and so do my nieces. I have to fight them for it from time to time.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Very addicting. Also lots of new stuff, its like playing a completely different game. Fun everytime. This is extremely creative.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really enjoyed the game an  really exited the second one came out way to go temple run keep up the good work
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Purchased for preschool. Too many popups to upgrade. These make it difficult for children to use app since they do not read.
B005H29GSI|5.0|The game itself is a pretty basic but fun family game. It says 5+, but I think any age angry bird fan would enjoy playing it with very little help from an older player. Your goal is to get to 1000 points, each player selects a card with a difficulty/point value of 100, 200, or 300 points. If you build and destroy the prescribed structure with the given birds you get your points. It's nice that the game is guaranteed to last at least 4 rounds, but it's unlikely to go on forever like other simple games (I'm looking at you Candy Land).<br /><br />Departing from the main game play, this is still a lot of fun as a toy building you own structures or stories and knocking pigs down. Our almost 4 year old son wants to keep playing well after we do. For his birthday we will be adding on with [[ASIN:B004U52VPS Angry Birds: Knock On Wood Game]]and/or [[ASIN:B007FRHZ4A Angry Birds: Birds in Space Game]] while they are still priced similarly to this one since his only complaint of the game was the lack of the small red bird (the big red bird and yellow bird are included in this set).<br /><br />Overall I highly recommended this for any young fans of the Angry Birds franchise.
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|So begins a sucession of &#34;artfully&#34; vilolent murders to keep us excited about sadism, romanticising sadism as only the display of mutilated beauties can. OK let's pretend this doesn't give alot of otherwise normal people erections,and it's really cool. Next we must somehow believe the Manson like serial killer  is so hypnotic that he seduces educated functioning human beings into not only doing his bidding but sacrificing their daily lives so that IF he needs them, someday they can be helpful in any number of gory ways. Perhaps stripping naked in an office building and ramming a knife completely thru their skull just to create a distraction. Dropping obvious clues that ordinary detectives miss but our anti-hero and the audience are clever enough to grasp sending us running to the scene with yet another sexy corpse dangling for us. I like Kevin Bacon  but really?
B001P7HUF0|3.0|good pictures with good performances by matt damon and danny devito..good directing and camera work and well written story by john grisham about entering the legal profession.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|A very good book!! I didn't want it to end. I can't wait for the third book to come out.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Love the game and it's a lot of fun. Love the zip lines and mind carry additions as well BUT the game can be slow to your reactions and sometimes just gets SLOW. Having some freezing problems too.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I got this book last night.I finished it this morning. One of the best books I have ever read. I can only hope nothing bad ever comes to Hazel and her family.
1450419895|4.0|This book has a wealth of technique and hints and tips. I was looking for a newer version of Muscle & Fitnesses Training Notebook where there is a consistent layout of anatomical picture on one side (with muscles highlit for the appropriate excercise) and the execution of that excercise on the other. I have not read even half of it, but the layout is not as concise as I had hoped it to be. Great book, but not a quick reference - its an actual read much like Schwarzeneggers Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding which I own and highly recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME ROCKS! YOU YOURSELF SHOULD GET IT. I DON'T CARE IF IT'S TO MUCH. YOU SHOULD GET IT!  DIGGIN MINECRAFT STYLE AHHH SEXY PIGGY! DIG DIG DIG DIG DIGGIN MINECRAFT STYLE! AWESOME!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a great game. The puzzles were fun and challenging. I would recommend this game to everyone. The graphics were outstanding and it had a great story line.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Loved this book! It is one of those books you can't put down. Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors!
B004WJV6OY|5.0|This DVD is a close look at the man Eddie Vedder has become. A beautiful philosophy and lovely music. Thanks.
B00899DR40|5.0|I bought this for my daughters and put it on my iPod  so they could listen in the car.  I find myself listening even when they are not in the car.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Cool story. A great combination of mini games, hidden object and puzzles. Quite addicting, never a dull moment. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Very good game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very easy to learn, my 8 year old loves it. It helps you learn a little bit about caring for real horses, and the graphics (on Kindle Fire HD) are absolutely amazing! The best part is that it's free without nearly as many limitations as most of the free games I've seen.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game but horse gets tired to easily and you run out of life points and money to easily also but good game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Thanks a lot for making another highly addictive games jerks lol ;) Ugh never gonna get work done now!  U rock
B00992CF6W|2.0|Hey what about 0.6.0 on kindle fire because I have a iPod and it has 0.6.0 on it<br /><br />So can you . Make that happen that would be cool
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Nice and and creepy, as most carnivals are. Good story. Cool characters. Even enjoyed the eerie circus music. Splendid mix of puzzles and hidden object games. Good game.
B000IAZ5HK|4.0|Does a good job of staying clean.  My other jars have all gotten irritatingly messy from drips.  I thought the $39 I paid for it was excessive.  I've been reading that online retailers are tweaking their prices constantly (hourly, etc).  I bought this in mid-December 2012.  Perhaps the price was high because demand for it as a Christmas gift allowed them to sell them at a higher price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very enjoyable and exciting unless you're on peaceful mode which in my opinion is boring but some times I use it when I get a lame world made entirely of water, I also recomend minecraft seeds pro which give you different worlds so you don't have boring worlds... here's some for you guys, G U N, aetherNETHER, annabelle2003.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|Lot's of adventure, suspense.  Great movie.  I would recommend people to buy this for there collection of Mission Impossible.  Tom Cruise is really the new James Bond.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app I great for passing time. You nee  WiFi for it tho. Other than that it is very cu and enter training for the whole family.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I LOVE this CD! Wonderful choice of songs and  he hits them all! Anema E Core is a song I grew up with  and heard it performed by many singers and I love Andrea's version! For those people who find this CD less that perfect....You don't know music!!
1449410243|5.0|If you like the blog and the Facebook page, you'll love this book.  Longer form jokes and the same sense of humor you've come to expect.  Worth it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It's a great game lol I like all the Dragon haha and yeah soo I guess it's cool and its great to play if your board u have the choice to buy gold and coins you can breed dragons to get new ones so umm yeah my point is its a great game I recommend it to everyone who likes dragon games or just buying time GET THE GAME NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I am really a fan of Batman movies, except this one.  Didn't care for it.  The story was not that great and it didn't keep me interested.  Sorry but this one bomb out for me.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It's better to have the Uk version on DVD, PBS cut so much out to fit in the time slot!!!!!
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|At last a video player that can stream videos on my Kindle Fire without sync issues or stuttering. Why is this app free? Where can I donate?
B0045DO8II|5.0|Best Outlaws album ever! Flat out great versions of songs like Green Grass & High Tides ... A Killer album!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Gives control over your file system.<br />Comething Kindle should have built in.<br />Great browser product for Kindle<br />It is essential.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Jeremy Renner was great in this movie and what a body he has.  Loved the motorcyle chase.  Lots of action.  Bought this for my collection.
B00APPJELG|5.0|I just finished re-watching the first two seasons of Downton Abbey, and I was curious what events would make it into this summary review. Dear God, I rather hate myself for giggling so much, but just you try to watch with a straight face as poor Mr. Pamuk's corpse flops so comically so many times. I dare you.<br /><br />The lighthearted tone and the perfect interspersing of dialogue from the show itself made for an excellent encouragement to get on with the watching of Season Three. Jolly good, everyone.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|the king of pop and all his best on one cd it dont get any better than that..great cd for sure
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game kept me entertained for several hours. The puzzles were pretty straightforward and not too difficult-perfect for some idle time without being too taxing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|For $18 you can enjoy 9 evenings of the magnificent Downton Abbey season 3 (for those of you/us who missed it on PBS). Everything good about the series that you have heard is true, and the service by Amazon that allows us to watch it at home on wintry evenings in front of a cozy fire (maybe with a claret in hand) is great.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|I thought the special effects were great.  Josh Brolin really did a good job imiating Tommy Lee Jones.  Overall I did enjoy the movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thought the book was great. I did see the movie first, but the book was enjoyable. It was different from the movie which made the book more surprising. The book also did a better job of developing the characters and was extremely funny at times as well.
B007R9MFPU|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at this CD and proudly place it beside the better Ultravox Midge Ure period releases. I like it better than Lament and UVOX. Fits in nicely with Quartet. Bravo!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I purchased this box set for my son for Christmas.  He as always loved the series and was so excited when he opened that package on Christmas morning.
0525952926|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it! Ken Follett is the best at bringing to life historical events and explaining their background in such a way that the reader gains a new understanding of how wars came to be fought and the selfish power struggles of all the countries involved. The list of characters at the beginning of the book is essential in keeping everyone straight. I can't wait for the next volume in this fabulous trilogy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i am not a computer geek at all. i dont play these games but this game rocks! i hope you like this game as much as i do.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Dark, brooding, brutal... The Dark Knight returns and and he is older, wiser and unforgiving. Only the passage of time could have taken him to this place and the world may indeed remain dark forever. Gotham stands on the brink of the abyss and only Batman can possible saves the remnants of what once was.
B004P1JEWU|4.0|A Storm of Swords<br />Like many serial novels one is addicted to the characters an their fate. This book is full of suprises with the author adopting a ruthless attitude and killing off or apparently killing off a number of characters that one has emotional attachment to.
0525478817|5.0|I'm an avid reader, and always have been. I read everything from biographies, and non-fiction, to kids books, classics, and of course the occasional teen read. This book blew my socks off. I literally could not put it down. I read it at work, I read it at home, I read it in public, I read it while commuting. It's brilliant. You will not regret reading this book.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|Great lyrics and great beats. This is an album that isn't about money and drugs and a bunch of BS. This albums is about real stuff and has a real message. Well worth the $6 I spent and then some.
B003H9M1QM|4.0|I got this for my daughter as much for me. She loves watching it, and it's neat to see some of the bonus features. The color is fresh and it's so well preserved, I forget how old this movie really is! It's nice to have her watch something other than princesses and faeries.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|No better way to spend time with a TV. Brilliant writing, brilliant casting, brilliant acting in a word ... brilliant!
0030839939|1.0|There is a good reason why this book was only published once in the 70s and never printed again. The authors are more confused than the reader of the book. They switch notations left and right with no particular reason. It seems as if the authors wrote the book in a hurry while spending their mornings on the toilet seat. They never bothered going back and correcting many of their numerous mistakes and typos in the book. This book is a pure example of what should NOT be published.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|Actually love walking dead season three  (and one and two).  Don't particularly care for on demand video as the last two times I have tried to watch the videos I purchased, I was unable to do so.  One time I can't get on, I can overlook.  Two separate days that I cannot access the videos and I think that amazon is charging me for a service that they cannot deliver on and should give me a refund.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|long live the apps for Tablets ..great full screen and works just like the real thing ...good job making this app , thank you.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I've watched this show faithfully since its debut and want all of its episodes on DVD so I started with Season One. This is a great show for any Sci-Fi fan. It's smart, funny and enjoyable.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very good at this. it doesn't take any brains for this one.  what else can i say about it but awesome.
B008NMT684|5.0|20 month old grandson loves this app! Downloaded the free one first, he plays it so much i unlocked the rest! Its pretty easy for him to drag and drop, and then loves trying to pop all the balloons when he does it correctly. Plays this puzzle all the time!
B004BLJQOK|2.0|Movie great, except the last 1/4 to 1/2 the picture would freeze and disc would have to be restarted and go to select scenes and start from there to find the scene I wanted to go to. Sometimes this would work, sometimes it wouldn't. this happened 3 or 4 times, this sort of ruins the movie when this part is pretty intense.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This series is unbelievable! I cannot put the books down after I start them! I have fallen in love with the Caster world!
B000ELJBAK|5.0|I love this album by David Gilmour...I love ANY music by David Gilmour! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! GREAT BUY!!! :) &#60;3
B005LAJ16I|5.0|heard about this show from a friend,  was skeptical,  can't stop watching it!!  one of the best shows i've seen in a long time
B007DJUO8O|4.0|Title of review sums it up. Its an interesting listen, but a very very mellow one. Very ambient, lots of finger picking guitars, layered Vocal melody lines, and nice-almost whispering Vocals for the most part. Sounds like acoustic Opeth with a heavy touch of 'Ion' (if anyone knows about that band). Dark but very mellow and adventurous. Actually maybe a bit overindulgent, but what do they have to lose? Some of the songs could use a time trim. Its a long listen and one you must be in the mood for. This is no background music, well unless you are going to sleep.<br /><br />Its what I pretty much expected except that its mellower than I thought it would be. And I thought it would be mellow. This CD is very 'quiet' and slow moving. I do like it but am not blown away by it. Have listened several times. The Vocals are really soothing and the production is immaculate. A good 'side project' but do not expect to hear songs that will immediately stick with you. Be prepared to take an hour and really listen to it several times to appreciate it. The first 2 times I listened it didnt stick. If you like Acoustic Opeth stuff and Steven Wilson's Vox as well, you should like this.<br /><br />(Wouldnt be surprised if Aldo Nova went after them for taking the same chords from 'Fantasy' in the title track, albeit a totally different atmosphere... I knew it sounded familiar..)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|there are many versions accessible; the ability to download different versions which allow you to read the Bible without be connected to the internet is a plus, if your church doesn't quite have the whole wireless internet set-up as yet
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Simple. Easy. True. Everybody should spend sometime on this book. We don't fall out of love we just forget how to love the one we are with.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I first played this game on my pc. Seemed easier to play, more options for moving cards. Wasn't impressed even though the changes are little ones.
0515153656|5.0|Interesting reading.  Reacher is an intelligent man out of his normal space, but you know he's going to find his way, even after the first chapter.
0765325950|5.0|The stunning conclusion to the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan left me speechless at times and overwhelmed with emotion at others (Bela and Egwene especially). Cannot give greater praise to Brandon Sanderson who tool on a daunting task of filling the shoes of one of the world's most beloved authors. I say to you sir, Bravo!!! I cannot wait to get my copy signed and will treasure it forever. READ THIS BOOK!
0765325950|3.0|I blew through this in a day. One might think, after waiting 20 years, that one might want to savor the denouement. Not really. Sanderson has done an admirable job of tying off the plotline insanity that Jordan perpetuated; it's not elegant, it's not great, but it is *done*. I am satisfied. (I really regret reading some of those books. Personally, I think a lovely digital project would be to tag each chapter/plotline/character so that you could go through and just read Lans story, or Mats, or Perrins, or ... you get the idea. It'll never happen, of course, but that is what I've always wanted.)<br /><br />There is no way to make everyone happy. If you've slogged through the rest of this series, you know you are going to read this regardless; be grateful that it doesn't make your eyes bleed. Don't make yourself re-read all the others first, unless that's how you choose to torture yourself. The book is entirely readable (and maybe more so) even if you can't remember how the hell half the people got where they were, and who even a quarter of them are. I'm thankful that Sanderson took on the project, so that the fans could have some closure. And now I have yet another doorstop.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great love story, such a touching story. The ending was very suspenseful,  and kept me on my toes till the very end.
B005LAII80|5.0|This was everything I hoped it would be. Stallone's version was kind of funny at times, but this was brutal and believable at all times. The villains were villainous, the heroes were brutal, but likeable. Dredd was a beast, but clearly has been effected by his enviornment.<br /><br />I think anyone who has a thing for action, should watch this movie. The ending was even a bit unexpected.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|E L. James writes a beautiful love story with a few kinky spots.  I found it a page-turner and I am looking forward to reading the book she is now writing.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|A friend of mine introduce this app to me as we have used it religiously to find excellent local hidden gems. Reading many of the reviews sometimes is like watching Saturday Night Live. Some comments are outrangeous and tell it like it is. Some are snobbish so it is good to check where the reviewer lives.
B000FO0AOC|4.0|A great collection!  Sound is well remastered and there is not a bad song on the cd. This is Otis Reddding at his Best!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Though a little lost at first, once I got my bearings, I couldn't put this game down! Different than simple hidden object games, this one was more focused on puzzles and figuring out where you are/what to do next. Fun and enjoyable game, played full-through took me about two hours, maybe a tad more. Worth the price and one I'd recommend to any puzzle-game lover.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Batman in this non canonical animated story is older and in retirement, only to come out when he can't take the rot of the city any longer. The story was fun to watch and a bit more brutal than the normal stuff. I recommend getting both part 1 and 2 and watching them back to back.<br /><br />Nothing like getting the whole story at once, am I right?
B00B2V66VS|4.0|fun but sloooooooowwwwwww!!!!!!!I had to earase  it and get it again to get it to work but I like it super awesome!
030745455X|5.0|Good condition but I thought I was ordering the third book. Not a big deal. I am sure I can find someone to read it!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really liked the book. It made me cry, laugh and I  could understand where they were coming from. Good heartwarming love story.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|For some reason when I am out of town, my weather channel app doesn't change to the city I am in.  I have to constantly input the city and keep up with the weather each time.  Now, It seems to be stuck on the last city I was visiting, which was Richmond. It should be simpler than this!!??  What's up with that?
B004GHNIRK|5.0|If one hasn't read this book recently or never, it is a must read (again).  The character development, plot and sub themes are intriguing and dare I say uplifting.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|this could be great if it actually didn't have to been removed and then reloaded each time to use it. graphics are alright. __ the movement of horse needs improvement however its a great start for virtual effects
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is so well written.  The story  leaves you breathless, sad, happy, crying, smiling... It is by far one of my all time favorite books ever.  You just can't stop reading it, it's a page turner for sure!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I love this audio music cd because I simply fell in love with Russell Crowe's singing.  He singing was thoughtful, intense, entertaining, and reached out to me.  I give Russell Crowe #5 Stars!
B00886XQO0|4.0|This headset is amazing does everything and the clarity the speakers put out is phenomenal . The only problems I had with this headset is that the ear cups are made of leather an my ears tend to get hot an sweat a little, also preset #1 I guess is messed up and has distortion but the headset isnt damaged. there's 8 presets you can switch to by the button on the headset I use preset #2 and everything sounds great and has a nice kick to blasts on black ops 2 . It gives you freedom of wires but does have a 10 foot charge cable for when the battery dies and you still want to use it . I recommend these to anyone. And you can also use these to watch tv if your tv has an optical outlet or has a device with the outlet connected to your tv.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Looking for further confirmation on if this will work in your Synology NAS?  It works with no issues.  I tried many other &#34;spare&#34; 2GB memory modules laying around with the same timings, but they just did not work for some reason.  I broke down and took a chance based on review and all worked out well.  NOTE: Upon start up, my NAS did take a minute or so longer to boot.  I would imagine it was a verification on the new module.  I imagine it will boot with normal times if I have to reboot.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This was an amazing series! Not typically something I would read but this series may be the best thing I have ever picked up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun game, kids enjoy it and the whole fan has had a blast playing it! It would be worth buying if it weren't free!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I thought it was a great read.  Presenting both an American and a German perspective on an incredible event kept me entranced.  The German pilot's Christianity was particularly interesting.  Having spent my early years hating Germans I never thought of them as Christians.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A truly captivating book with a great ending.  Keeps you entertained from the very beginning.  Has the perfect amount of live suspense and intrigue.  Great book.
015204907X|5.0|My 10-month-old daughter loves the repetitive prose and the fun illustrations.  I like the creative &#34;story.&#34; In addition to &#34;Ten Fingers, Ten Toes,&#34; this is my daughter's favorite Mem Fox book.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Entertaining story and excellent special effects.  Great performance by Andy Serkis, making \\"Ceasar\\" come to life.  The DVD arrived in about 5 days.  This item was purchased from a reliable vendor.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OOOOMMMMMGGGGGG!!! This is one of the BEST books I have read! I absolutely LOVE everything about this one! There were so many things that had me on edge waiting and wanting more more more I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I absolutely love Colleen's writing! I have read all 3 books she has written so far and each one seems to get better!<br /><br />This was a roller-coaster of a ride and I loved every minute of it. You will not see things coming and that is what I love the most about it. When I got to some points in this one I was just dumbfounded because I NEVER saw it coming! I absolutely LOVE when a book can throw me like that. I yelled out when I got to one point \\"Things JUST got INTERESTING\\" and my husband laughed at me and shook his head. He knows it is a good book when I start talking to myself as I read.<br /><br />There is no question in my mind that I will purchase every book that Mrs. Hoover writes for the simple fact that I have YET to be disappointed and I highly doubt that I ever will.<br /><br />I will never see star-gazing the same!<br /><br />This book is all around a great book! You will laugh, cry, hurt, get ANGRY, and just feel just about every emotion that you can think. This will NOT disappoint! You will be confused up to a point then all will reveal itself and as soon as that happens you can forget everyday life around you because you will not be able to put it down.<br /><br />It absolutely is not an easy read and may not be suitable for everyone due to some of the subject matter. I do not believe that it is for young teenagers because of the twist and turns that do occur in the book. Yes the characters are teenagers and in high school and it is a romance. There are times that I did forget that they are just teenagers but I believe  it might be a little intense for the young ones.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|I bought this movie after I watched it one night.  It was so intriguing that I wanted to watch it again so that I could pick up on the parts I mis-understood.  It is thrilling!<br /><br />L. Henry<br />Columbus, Ohio
B00479SVBU|5.0|I have a 2004 bmw x3 that has no MP3 jack. There is supposed to be a rear chassis connector, but car has nav so that plug is occupied. Dealer wanted a fortune to add mp3, about $800. First radio transmitter was a Scosche unit from Walmart. Sound was tinny, hissy and definitely monaural with a weak signal, suitable for a single speaker low end radio at best for talking books, but not music.The good: cost around 13 bucks.<br /><br />This unit, on the other hand is simply amazing. There is a slight amount of discernable hiss between sound tracks. Very slight, I didn't find it at all noticeable, especially when driving. I had to crank the treble up, then the sound truly opened up. Supposedly you can insert an sd card and the soundfly will then take control of that card's programming. I haven't tried this yet. I use sd micro cards, so I would need an adapter to use them. A remote is supplied. I did not use it as I'm using a 3.5mm mini plug from a Sansa player, so control is through the Sansa player. A cord and extra safety fuse is supplied. The unit looks attractive, the sound is full and rich down to the powerful bass, whoever engineered this unit did a most thourough engineering job. Bravo to their efforts. Oh, and the Soundfly produces true stereo with left/right channels properly oriented, not mono. I concur that at double the asking this unit ought to be considered essential equipment for any setup without an MP3 capability. In my case the $800 option from the dealer is not an option. This unit even replaces the cassette option on one of my cars where that was used.
068987751X|4.0|The paper engineering in this book is very cute and easy enough for my 10-month-old daughter to work on her own.  The prose is minimal, but that's just fine, as the point of this book appears to be the illustrations and pop-ups.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This twist on Sherlock Holmes is an enjoyable one.  The acting is great and Aidan Quinn has always been a favorite.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I really like this movie, it came in perfect condition, I can still watch it anytime. Thank You. The best!
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|this game is great just that it needs to be fixed it keeps signing me out and theres also in menu it says server timed out try again later this needs to be fixed until then no 5 stars.
B000002AGN|5.0|Now that the inestimable Mr. Brubeck is gone, how will he be remembered? &#34;Time Out&#34; is the way. Not a jazz man worth his salt will not have listened to this record.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I did not care how the book ended, but otherwise it was a really good read. a lot of twists.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent as always - Downton Abbey 3 was pure joy to watch.  I appreciate the wit of Maggie Smith ever so much and the acting is superb.  Now I can't wait for Season 4!
B001QB9H1A|5.0|The Transporter 3 movie came in perfect condition, ok movie, I still have to watch the entire movie. Thank you.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Season 2 was dragging on.  They made up for it with the last two episodes.  This season has been great every episode and hasn't disappointed.  If only they would kill Andrea!!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|It meant a lot of great viewing hours for me and hubby.  Great acting job by Bryan Cranston and the entire cast
030758836X|5.0|What with 7,000+ reviews already written, there's not much I can add, other than I want to vote \\"5 stars.\\"  Getting through the first segment was like that first long ride up the hill on the roller coaster just waiting for the bottom to fall out.  Then I took the first plunge, where I thought \\"A\\" was true.  But no, I continued on, and found out it's \\"B\\" that is true.  But wait, no, it's really \\"C\\"!!  My only disappointment was that I wasn't breathless at the end.  Yes, the whole thing was quite implausible, but sometimes it's fun to get drawn into a story like that.  I guess that's why they call it fiction.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Ever since I saw The Hobbit I wanted to buy the soundtrack right away! It's beautifully composed and just like the LoTR's soundtrack, I knew it's going to be wonderful~ I pretty much listen to the whole soundtrack on the way to class almost every single day and it makes my whole day epic.<br /><br />I love it so much! Thanks and cheers~!
B005LLX582|5.0|I like The Tree Of Life movie. Life, we have one . . . How we live our life . . . We have only one life to live . . .  Look at our lives . . . How has it been? Only one life? Anyway . . . Makes me think about that more, life. I like the actors, Sean Penn, Brad Pitt etc. 2 of my favorites. Beautiful photography!<br /><br />The move came in perfect condition.<br /><br />Thank you!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|omg ok I started playing this and other reviews it says he comes after 4 pages and I'm at 4 pages and I freaked because its picture bleach where I am only play if ur ready to crap ur pants
B0063GORYU|5.0|probably one of the most addictive and frustrating games I have played. easy to use and the different levels are great, spend ages on this without realising the time. still nowhere near cracking four suits, won't give up though.
0061537969|5.0|I knew nothing about the book when I started, so was instantly taken in by the fact that it was written from the perspective of the dog.  I must admit I had twinges of conscience about anthropomorphizing on the author's part, and thus by me, the reader -- but I got over it!  Yes, it is a sentimental story, so if tear-jerker endings are not your thing, then just don't read the book.  But if you ever wonder what your pet is thinking, why dogs chase cars and squirrels, or why they bark at the TV, you will be amused by this.  Others have commented about the weak link to car racing, but without it, the human hero wouldn't have much of a job, and it's something that allows the human and canine to spend time together doing something more original than endlessly tossing sticks or a ball.  I didn't find the car-racing analogies to be distracting at all.  And the expectations for reincarnation gave the dog hope, since dogs presumably aren't otherwise religious, with hopes for an afterlife.  All in all, it was the most enjoyable read I've had in awhile.<br /><br />For those with younger kids, note that there is a youth version, just called 'Racing in the Rain.'  I don't know how it differs, but you could probably find that out from Amazon reviews.
B002436WFI|5.0|its way better than the actual book-<br />it holds true to rest of the disk world series and is long enough to not cut bug holes in the story.<br />its nice to see what's imagined. I love the interview with Terry Pratchett.<br />I am very glad my husband bought it for us. It was a great Hogfather's gift.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Detailed information, convenient and very simple to figure out how to navigate around the site. The forecasts have been accurate also.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|The Deathly Hallows Part 1 DVD is fine. The story is great. It is a must have for Harry Potter fans.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really love this app. It's the basic solitaire game &amp; is free. The only annoyance is the advertisements that constantly pop up. I know that is what you get for free, but really?! So annoying! Get rid of advertisements &amp; then it will be the perfect solitaire app!
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|This movie must have been created by someone who spent way too much time playing violent video games.  I'm giving one star for the cast, but even star power couldn't save the movie.  The two things I didn't care for most, as other reviewers have stated, were all the silent brooding glances and stares, and all the bloody violence.  Really, do we have to see a head explode?  I actually did like the soundtrack, or at least the final song.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|A perfect end to a perfect story. The whole series was a roller coaster ride that I couldn't jump off of.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|I'm very impressed. I'm a 26 year old single mom of a 3 year old boy who idolizes this guy. I have been a belieber for quite some time myself haha! He is ambitious and isnt afraid to let the entire world see and feel his vulnerability and emotions through his  music.  It is such a brave thing for such a popular, young, good looking kid! Anyone who doesn't give this album a shot would be foolish. He is an exceptional person and to let the world watch him grow up and have rumors made up about you...and to be a constant talk of news and tabloids to still put on this music is truly spectacular. He's even got non beliebers beliebing! buy it...I'd give it 50 stars if I could. :)
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince DVD is fine. The story is great. It is a must have for Harry Potter fans.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|special effects good but did not meet up with the books. Better than 1st movie.. Good movie to view but not buy
B005RDF2NA|5.0|Loved the music and the humor. Story line was simple and sweet. Definitely worth purchasing. Would recommend to friends and family.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Good but would be nice to have varied competition game set ups instead of just click button with a slider bar.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Great app!  I like the large numbers and It's ease of operation.  Great app to have on your iPad or iPhone.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I love the creativity of the musician named Wally, and his best song of 2012 &#34;Somebody I Used to Know&#34;. He has an innovative style, and every track on this CD is a winner.  Catch his videos on You-Tube if you haven't already.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|i think this is one of the best rebus .it has moved out of his usual haunts.good description of places and views.gives a fuller concept of other areas in scotland and some hint of the lifestyle away from the big towns.i really enjoyed this book.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|I read this for my book club and enjoyed it. It keeps you interested, but I initially found the switch between the past and present tough to follow.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Got this for my sister for Christmas.  Funny movie!  We forgot that it had a sad part, his wife dies, and my Mom just died and we were watching the movie with my Dad.  Oops... The movie is well made enough that enjoyed it anyway.  I got a good price on the DVD and it arrived in time for Christmas.  Thanks!
B00138JAI6|5.0|This is a fantastic CD originally released in 1959.  So many different styles of jazz music are captured on this one CD which makes every song a masterpiece in its own right.  Love it!
030758836X|5.0|This is one that starts off slowly, and gains momentum and interest, then ends with a wonderful twist. I didn't like the characters, and got sucked in anyway, and at the end loved the justice they wrecked on themselves. Hate the title of the book though.....
B00005JNBQ|5.0|this was for my god daughter, she said napoleon dynamite is the perfect man, she watches it everday after school
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This is a wonderful show that I can't believe they haven't made more episodes of.  The characters are fantastic, and the special effects well done.  I wish there were more seasons so more of the characters backgrounds and emotional stuff could be worked out.
B003YHSE7W|3.0|Value for money..happy to keep as a gift to my self for collection item movie.i also will recommend to my friend
B001NLKT60|5.0|I bought the book The Girl with the dragon tatoo after viewing the movie and quite frankly didn't understand what happened in many occasions. The book is superb, very clear and suspenful, after that I saw the movie again and bought the other two books that Stieg Larson wrote, they are all excellent.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great realistic game.I would definitely get it again for my kindle fire. I love my horse beauty. Especially grooming her
B003VW8GT6|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in years, it was great to see it<br />again.  Made back when they made family films.<br />It's John Wayne, how can you not love it.

B005OCFHHK|5.0|We have two of these movies but thought they would be better in blu-ray, so I gave my old ones away and bought the whole set in blu-ray. Can't wait to watch them with family and/or friends.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|awsome game for kids who love to play Dr.  You help 8 different animals get better by doing different tasks like giving a shot and then putting on a band aid or putting ointment on swolen eyes to make them better and great graphics and smooth movement.  one of the best free app of the days we have come across and I've downloaded 450 +
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This app or game is fine. It's different but not bad for what it is. Do like the interaction you can't get in any other game but it's kinda boring
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's good for a journal on the go and impossible to lose. Plus it's nice I can access it on more then one device.
0385535147|3.0|I read many different types of books, and there are clearly times when I am simply in the mood for some good escapism. John Grisham has regularly delivered that. In the past I have relied on Grisham to tell a good tale, to create a setting which teaches me something new about the implications of the law, and to entertain me. I had not read any review for this book before starting it, but I settled in for a typical Grisham mixture of clever plotting, suspenseful development, and a healthy infusion of background work to intensify the realism of the story and create empathy with his characters. The Racketeer delivers a moderately good story, couched within the framework of the Witness Protection Program, but it lacks the usual impact that Grisham has been able to provide.<br /><br />This book labors along without really going anywhere. Essential plot twists are withheld and dropped in only as necessary to keep the reader from becoming totally lost. I frequently wondered if I had been reading too quickly and had missed a crucial plot detail. Too much of this story seems to be composed of afterthoughts without any real connection with each other. Somewhat disturbing, upon finishing the book, was Grisham's own Afterword containing, in part: \\"This is indeed a work of fiction, and more so than usual. Almost nothing in the previous 340-odd pages is based on reality. Research, hardly a priority, was rarely called upon. Accuracy was not deemed crucial. Long paragraphs of fiction were used to avoid looking up facts.\\"  Perhaps Mr. Grisham lacked the inspiration to churn out one of the well-crafted stories for which he has earned such a fine reputation. I look forward to reading his next one.

B003O86FMW|5.0|That's all I can say after this book. A huge cliffhanger. Extremely well written and it's an amazing sequel to Suzanne Collins' first book. An extremely good read.

0316069434|5.0|I only wish i could read a Harry Bosch book more often - i have them all and was so thrilled to see Black Box which was published last November.  This book should have more than five starts - it grabbed you from the first page and is a book you don't want to end.  Thank you Michael Connelly for letting your readers ride along with Harry's life and his missions - he is one of a kind.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome totally cool horse racing is so much fun awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome horses training is so much fun
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I adored this book.  It was a gentle and thought provoking tale of a man who goes on a journey that enables him to understand his life and the nature of forgiveness.  I could not put it it down.
B000LP6KSU|2.0|I bought the amended version of this CD to get clean versions of the songs, especially the song &#34;Teenagers&#34;.  The CD I got was identical to the original CD I bought several years ago. Disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its good but i wish there were diffent places you could choose to run in and not just have one place
B003B02PF4|4.0|I enjoyed the characters and suspence of this novel. The cultural trip through Italy was a refreshing change for grisham.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I thought the book was pretty good. It was predictable but overall worth a read. I really liked that the female character was well written, but I feel like the father could have been flushed out a bit more, he was a little too perfect.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|There is absolutely no help for you if anything happens to your account! Hotmail is horrible and I would never use them again
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am loving this series of books. Very exciting. Can not help but cheer for Katniss! Ready for number three.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love all of the complexities of the rich and their vulnerabilities and servants and the community and their's.  The show displays the dynamics of how they coexist and how they are disfunctional.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Its easy to load and playback is great. Worth it over watching it free online. I like that it doesn't take up room on our shelves.
B00B0NDF26|3.0|I'm a big fan of T&S stuff, but this able just sounds kind of flat to me.  It needs a little salt.  Make sure you preview it before you buy it.
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|With names like Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Matthew Broderick, Alan Alda, Tea Leoni and a few others, you'd expect greatness. While the movie was decent, it definitely didn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />I first saw the trailer for this movie during the opening of another movie. I thought it looked good and sounded interesting, so I made a mental note to watch it when it came out on DVD. As luck would have it, my local library had a copy begging to be reserved. I grabbed it and popped it in ready for excitement. While there were a few moments on edge-of-your seat thrill, there weren't many. Maybe the jokes made up for it? Let me put it this way, my wife turned to me when the movie was roughly half over and said \\"I thought you said this was supposed to be a comedy?\\" Ouch.<br /><br />It is a decent movie that had the potential to be so much better. Maybe too much star power threw off the balance of the movie.
B0083WLKBA|5.0|I am so totally in love with Downton Abbey!  I watch the seasons over and over.  I feel like they're my family members.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I love this series! I hate that it is going off the air! This series makes you forget about the everyday grind and fall into a great thriller of a story!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Very exciting, keeps you attention.  Great acting.  Photography was super. It stay close to the original story line, but on a mature lever.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game. it is very fun and user friendly. Easy to follow.  One of the greatest free horse games
B001DHXT6G|5.0|If you like Star Trek, these digitally remastered original series episodes are incredible.  High quality, cool packaging, and works great.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|Very nice to sleep to, has noticeably helped my 6 month old settle back down after night waking. Loses two stars due to alarm issue. The alarm volume is the same as the white noise volume. Obviously, the alarm should be MUCH LOUDER than the background noise to which one is sleeping. Also, the white noise needs to be playing for the alarm to go off, would be nice if you could just set the alarm. Until the alarm volume is able to be set separately this app can't get more than 3 stars.
0316228532|2.0|I was very disappointed. I could'nt force myself to finish this book, it was such a slow, painful thing to read. I loved HP, so I thought I'd give it a try. Not for me .
0765325950|5.0|So why all the crying here? This book ended the way Jordan wanted it. If you think Jordan &#34;lost his way&#34; along the path of the series as some claim, then why continue reading it? Just so you can complain about the final book? Why should you even care how the series ended if you think the series was lagging already?<br /><br />This book is one long battle for the most part, and I think it conveys well the consequences of such a battle. Did your favorite character not die heroically enough? Were the just mentioned as an afterthought? Well that happens in real battle all the time. One moment Johnny is there beside you and the next minute he isn't.<br /><br />And anyone who didn't expect some stylistic changes in a series where the original author has passed away, well you were setting yourself up for disappointment from the beginning. I think Brandon has taken on such a massive job here that, and he knows this well, there was no way he was going to write the perfect parts to fill in the holes left in the ending. So I am giving this book 5 stars because of all of that which is involved.<br /><br />While reading the book I experienced some of the things already mentioned by other reviewers. Characters I thought would have more involvement didn't and some died that I thought would have more impact to the story. The battle scenes do go on and on, but this is the Last Battle, and it was not unexpected that it would be a big book about a long battle. I think the story conveyed well that when there is a huge battle going on that a lot of the other things you maybe thought would occur or develop don't because everyone is involved in the battle. Ask yourself this, if the Last Battle had been relegated to a couple of chapters would it have really felt like it was the Last Battle?<br /><br />And as I said in my title, this was the ending that Robert Jordan wanted. I have seen people complain that they think Sanderson changed it, but he didn't. He has been filling in holes in a road that had a lot of them and not all of them will get filled. It was such a huge task that I think was as admirably done as any one person could have. We will never know what Robert Jordan himself would have felt about how Sanderson handled everything but to expect the ending to be different was more a failing on the reader than anything Sanderson did.in a road that had a lot of them and not all of them will get filled.

B00062RCBW|5.0|Way better than the cheap bulk packaged set.  Special features are great, menus and disc quality are better too.  Well worth the money.
B004FGMV0W|2.0|I didn't really like this cd it was better than the one she made before this, but I only really liked a few songs instead of most of them.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|it is awesome there are sometimes new power-ups like an hour glass.there is a little comic too! there are pretty cool graphics.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I was never sure which way it was going to go.  I'm not sure I was crazy about the ending, but it seems inevitable now.
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|First off i was sceptical buying this rig because i know you get what you pay for. With that said Condor makes your money go pretty far. This rig is for sure made for the 5.56 mags ak mags dont work well with it, you can only fit three and there are way more pistol mag pouches than i have mags for, and the molle webbing on both sides works great for the for the serpa s.t.r.i.k.e platfrom, and it fits great. Also not listed in the description is a balistic plate holder behind where you would put mags, unnecessary to me but cool nonetheless.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD.  I hadn't hurd them in awhile ,so its good to be reminded why I like it.
6304936303|4.0|I've been searching for this film for sometime and when I saw it was only one cent I had to order it. Great condition of the disc.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I started using Evermore on my PC for school. I use it for notes, making copies, storing research.  It is such a great tool. It syncs easily between my PC and Kindle Fire so I can take my notes anywhere.
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|Though it did come on time, i was extremely disappointed with the product. When i plugged it in there was audio but no video. Come to find out there are ALOT of people with the same issue on the internet so there must be a ton of faulty cords like mine out there.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This absolutely met my expectations. This was a birthday gift for my granddaughter and we watched it together. It was wonderful!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game. Very addictive. I play it every day. There's a lot of levels and Game choices. Just like Bejewled.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a very fun game! realistic horse and great graphics.  I would recommend this game to almost any age.
055380684X|4.0|Breaking down the factors to genius makes it more attainable. Savants and &#34;hotbeds&#34; of talent have always been interesting to me. Now I have a larger pool of base knowledge to pull from when having discussions and attempting to steer my children down the right paths of life.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|The board is a great budget board, lots of features. But the documentation could be better and the bios is kind of weird if your not use to it. OK for over clocking my ram still isn't running as fast as advertised. It really is a great board for the money. Easy setup. Raid 0 was a little tricky to setup but nothing Google can't help with.
B0078QYI1G|5.0|Or better said, I would love it if Amazon would let me download the music instead of trying to shove Cloud Player down my throat. Yesterday, I spent several hours fiddling, sending emails and chatting with Amazon customer service and while the help desk tried hard, if Amazon can't or won't make a system work, there is nothing to be done. This is probably my last MP3 download from Amazon.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Me and my friends have this game. We think that it is so awesome. We love it. This is a wonderful and great game
B000W91RUG|5.0|I enjoyed this product because I enjoy the series. It pokes fun at America's anti-intellectualism by painting the above average intelligence of the main cast members as an obstacle to be overcome in everyday situations. If you pay close attention, they even manage to teach alittle in the &#34;white noise&#34; of the episodes. Outstanding writing and comedic situations.
034580404X|4.0|Definitely an erotic book.  Very interesting read, but I don't believe it's quite worth all the hype it has received.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|service was amazingly fast. the cd is in excellent condition, and the musical itself is exciting and moving. going to see it in person next. thank you.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very well written.  I was quite surprised to find out the American pilot was from my home town in West Virginia.  Some of my older friends remembers the incident of Brown's flying low over my home town which caused quite a stir.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|Just when you thought this classic album couldn't get any better.  Between the amazing sound quality and the added graphics, 2112 5.1 is a masterpiece, re-mastered!
B009AMAJPA|1.0|I have only seen parts of this film - an extended trailer.  That blood-soaked experience was enough to make me hate it.  Instead of this film, I would recommend \\"The Enchanted Cottage,\\" or \\"King of Masks,\\" or \\"Hugo.\\" Yes, the better titles are sometimes hard to find, but they are out there.  Let's just say that I am sensitive to over-the-top violence - that which seems to celebrate the worst of the human condition.  I believe that too many of those in the film biz have lost their way, on the way to the bank.<br /><br />If you care, I am a 71-year-old, educated, atheist, liberal democrat.  With increasing sadness and revulsion, I viewed the \\"choice\\" scenes from this film.  I wondered about those who create, those who finance, such unwatchable wall-to-wall gore.  Could it be that they have the same view as mine?  Could it be that by going over-the-top, they intended for the trailer to incite such a wave of revulsion that the public, and in turn the motion picture industry, might recoil and get back to setting an example of humanity at its best rather than the wall-to-wall inhumanity that this film represents.<br /><br />Is the glamorization of violence unintentional?  Today's bang, bang - you're dead films, seem less a cautionary tale than an affirmation that guns are the only answer.  Are children watching?  Are adults who can buy guns watching?<br /><br />This movie may simply be terrorism.  Pure greed may have been at work or it might well have been financed by those who see America as \\"the devil.\\"  And, of course the children are watching - R rating or not.  It's worse than dreck; it's poison.<br /><br />Another film which I can recommend - if you can find it - is \\"The Lucky Star (with Rod Steiger).\\"  It's a tale about a single gun, an old revolver.<br /><br />If that trailer for \\"Dead Man Down\\" does not fairly represent the movie, then someone should apologize for the trailer.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Gave a 3 star because it didn't include my calendar for me checking app'ts, etc.  Otherwise it is fine and easy to work with.  To me the calendar is important to go with my e/m for checking dates, etc.  I was able to get to my calendar through other means on my Yahoo site

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am not really sure how to begin a review for a book that so touched my heart, made me laugh and cry, was so exceptional, that it makes me wonder if my review is actually necessary!<br /><br />New York Times Best Selling Author (of three books within 12 months); Colleen Hoover, I am in awe. Hopeless, was incredible.<br /><br />Hopeless ostensibly charts the life-altering journey of 18 year-old, high school senior Sky Davis, whose home-schooled existence to date, had left her bereft of, (yet not saddened by), the nasty antics of immature teenagers, and the social and technological world including the Internet. With the exception of the movies, boy-groping, and eye-opening offerings from her feisty & irreverent neighbor Six, her experience of the real world was limited. She was beautiful, stubborn, intelligent, witty and courageous, but also undeniably broken.<br /><br />Fate seemed to bring handsome and mysterious Dean (Holder) and Sky together. Her presence was able to spark both life and confusion into Holder's world. This gorgeous young man, tattooed with the word `Hopeless', was anything but. In fact, his maturity, contemplative and generous nature leapt from the pages, procuring my full admiration and love. He was brave, thoughtful, passionate. He was also heart broken. Two girls he loved - he'd lost.<br /><br />Prior to Holder, Sky had cocooned herself in her safe bubble of numb existence. As Holder pried open her guarded soul with his thought provoking honesty and love, more than just passion and a desire to feel, arose. Disturbing images - long and safely buried - began to surface.<br /><br />This is not your typical narrative of teenage angst and woe, but a compelling, unraveling of a mystery, so unpredictable, that you will be kept guessing to the very end. It was impeccably elegant in its prose, and refreshingly unique in its tale.<br /><br />Sky of Holder<br />\\"I want him to lock his arms around me and throw away the key, because this is where he belongs..... \\"<br />\\"His presence alone works wonders for a wounded soul.\\"<br /><br />\\"I know by the way his existence is like a magnetic pull on my heart, that if he ever hurts me again, I'll be far from just 'fine'. I'll be broken.\\"<br /><br />Holder to Sky<br />\\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm not apologizing to you....because I don't want you to forgive me.\\"<br />\\"You don't deserve words, Sky. You deserve actions.\\"<br /><br />Interspersed perfectly amidst the deeply moving story, was incredibly funny and heart warning banter between characters. \\"Who makes ceramic salt and pepper shakers fashioned out of small and large intestines?\\" Who indeed?! Every character received their proportionate air-time; their contribution enhancing, not detracting from the story.<br /><br />There was no choice but to become consumed by Hopeless. Even in the name - it felt as though the cause for its title changed from being about a sad boy to a dedication to lost girls. It was a brilliant story about love, hope, betrayal, sadness, joy, courage, and survival. It's about the strength of two. \\"It's what happens when two people become one: they no longer only share love. They also share pain, heartache, sorrow, and grief. \\" Very poignant. Very apt. Very true.<br /><br />You will laugh, cry, moan and sigh as you read this book. You will fall in love with the characters. You will be affected deeply. You will be silenced by the stunning conclusion. That's the phenomenal strength and caliber of Colleen Hoover's writing.<br /><br />Should a sequel be written to Hopeless, I will unquestionably buy and devour it.
B007RXRSEY|3.0|Has some good music, but just is not as good as the last Slash album. Almost like this one got rushed out, after the success of the last one.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Absolutely love the case!!!  Heavy duty, and not bulky. Love the pink and grey color scheme. Like the added security of being waterproof.
B0025YKDJC|2.0|I am one of those &#34;original generation&#34; of fans of Jim Carrey, back when he was on Saturday NIght Live and when he did movies like Liar, Liar (classical!).  But his newer movies are kinda weird... mid-life crisis, kinda creepy (especially when he has a younger love interest).  I still love his old movies.  But this one (Yes Man) wasn't the worst... it was actually one of his better newer movies.  But I still didn't care for it.  It's a take it or leave it in my book, not a must-see movie but one if you got nothing else to do.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As another reviewer said - This is what all the hype was about?!  This book was predictable, boring and poorly written.  I expected something great from all of the publicity and word-of-mouth, but when I actually started reading....zzzzz.... I asked a friend (who had read book 1) what she thought and she agreed - waste of time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Highly recommended for all... not just for horse lovers.  Graphics are good!Cute game, very entertaining!  Definitely appropriate for all ages too!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a really good book. The ending leaves you hanging with not enough information, but that's the point I guess. Now I have to read the next one.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Great story and not a dull moment in the whole movie!  Liam Neeson never fails to give a top-notch performance.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a wonderful story of courage, hope and love. I enjoyed this book tremendously. I<br /> hope the movie will be as wonderful.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very fun game. There are many different ways to win each set. You can play it many times and not get tired of it.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|I loved watching Watchman like this. The extra scenes and the pirate motion comics made for a really enhanced experience
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Liam Neeson gives another great performance in this movie.  The story did not have one dull moment.  It's one of those movies you don't want to hit the pause button for any reason!!!
B000YDAYCW|5.0|This are my first per of boots, and they are pretty comfortable and looks good with jeans, they run big you should buy a full size less than you normally use!
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I would recommend this book to a teen who loves mythical creatures. And loves to read about romance, and fight for there lives :)
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Makos does a great job telling this amazing story of one small piece of WWII airwar in the European theatre. Chivalry and compassion did not go away during those awful times, as Makos so eloquently spins the tale of two pilots; one American and one German who came together in the air for one brief moment in history.<br /><br />Makos also introduces some of Germany's Luftwaffe heros; men who were not \\"fighting for Hitler or the Nazi party, but for Germany, just as our boys were fighting for there's. He also brings out some facts that many of us (including myself) may not have been aware of regarding Goerring and his \\"leadership\\" as the head of the German Air Force. The guy was, in my opinion, a real piece of work. After reading this book, my opinion is confirmed.<br /><br />Sure, there may be some technical glitches that some reviews bring out, but the story far outwieghs any errors you may identify.<br /><br />Read this book. You won't be able to put it down until you finish it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I lov Its apsolue this game surf on. And I love the graphics ti's is great great epic awesome fabulous I recommend this for anyone who likes temple run

B007VUA7VO|4.0|I find this is one of most-referenced apps on my Kindle Fire HD, although I've never taken the time to actually gauge how accurate it is. Amazon would do well to notice what this app is capable of and make similar information available on their next OS.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is one of the best books I have ever read. It's about a kid named August and his face does not look like other peoples faces. His face is not normal his eyes are too low he said his ears are like a crumpled up piece of paper and his nose is overly sized. He  was home schooled for a lot of years in his life until 5th grade. August was really nervous, his parent were arguing about if he should go to school or not. He started of school with about 3 friends but at the end of school he ended up with a lot of friends. At some parts of this story there were sad parts and some good and happy parts. Some of the parts are a little violent but it helped the story get more interesting.  I think every one should read this book because the lesson is it does not matter what you look like. You could be the ugliest person and be supper nice or really good looking and be super mean and rude. You have to get to know the person before you judge them by what they look like.<br /><br />By Noelle Solis
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun app teaches children responsibility of owning a horse  hours of finalist of fun. There is not much more to say about it
B004JN1D2I|5.0|More characters, sub plots, suspense, goose bumps, adventure, and craziness than you can imagine. The books were a spectacular &#34; read.&#34;
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Awesome book! I recommend it for people around the age of 15 or 16. Very powerful book for anyone who reads it.
0307387178|2.0|Really didn't like the subject matter.  Plan on  giving  this book  to some else who likes to read.  Not my subject
B0013FSL3E|4.0|We liked this movie with some reservation. The action is often more fast paced then it should be but the story was wonderful and a good cautionary tale about the pollution of the world from trash, etc.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|All the critics hated this movie. I don't get it. How high are your expectations when when you watch Abe the vampire really.  They do a great job tying it to history but not as much action as I would like.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|it is the most useless app i have ever thought to have purchased  not o a ggod idea<br /> to but this one sonce
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Ian Rankin has a way of writing that reminds me of an old friend telling you what has happened to him since last we met.  Another great story by John Rebus...
B000IJ79WU|1.0|The freaking DVD didn't even work, kept stopping and skipping.  Going for a refund and never looked back.  Not buying from this company again....1 star is too high.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was highly interesting and I love how the chapters were short and named.  I would read the name of the chapter would get excited about what would happen next.  It was great reading about Pat growing as a person after being in the \\"bad place\\".  This was truly an interesting read for me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you like romance read this series! Hope they come out with another and can't wait for movie!! What an awesome series
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Here again we find ourselves with a new Jack, Jack Jr., who is, for all intent and purposes, a carbon copy of daddy Ryan.  Same gaoes for all the other characters, Chavez=Clark, etc...  Could be more interesting if another thread is followed, such as giving Jack Jr's new girlfriend a more expanded role.  Hope this will be developed in the near future ...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game was pretty cool. I like that it changes the place about every mounth it keeps it interesting. I play on my kindle and most of the time its ok but sometimes it freezes.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I am already a fan of King and this has exemplified that love. It's a quick read that will remind many of his earlier novels. His talent for making the reader question what they would do is undeniable an exhilarating! Very worth the hour read.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I have this app on my kindle fire hd. It was working up until now. I wanted to watch a video but then the app keeps on freezing so i have to close it down and go to the app store and start all over again.
B008J05EL8|3.0|I'm not sure that I know what to do with this thing.  It has no instructions, no tech support and I have no clue as to how to use it.  If you could give me an idea, it would be extremely appreciated.  I though that it could be used when using Office with the i-pad; apparently not...???
1423113462|5.0|We got this book for my son for Christmas. He just picked it up the other day and couldn't put it down! It is a struggle to get him to read for 30 minutes a couple times a week! When his thirty minutes was up the other day, he asked if he could keep reading! That was music to my ears! He just loves this series and can't get enough! Keep them coming!
B00846REIS|5.0|I hesitantly purchased this book for my Kindle, not trusting the reviews and fearing it would be similar to Fifty shades of Gray(which I haven´t read in its entirety, but the excerpts I´ve read online have made me gag, not only is it ridiculous, the grammar mistakes and the childish writing  are a huge turn off!!!), but I´m delighted to say I was pleasantly surprised!!! I think this book is fantastic, plain and simple, it is wonderfully written and it does indeed have a plot(and a good one, just wait for book 2, Reflected in you), so it´s not just about hot, steamy sex(though there is plenty of that as well!)<br />I loved the characters, they´re both strong willed, stubborn and deeply, deeply flawed, but above everything they just want to be happy and find someone to love and love them back in return.<br />I cannot find a single fault in this book, I absolutely loved it and highly recommend it for those who enjoy an intense and angsty story!
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This is the best book I have ever read. This week I will read it again because it is that great, good,fantastic.  This book is so great that it could cost $100,000 dollars
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Fun. Kept my grandson busy and that makes it worthwhile. He even got my 74 year old self to play it.<br />Walt
B0060AY85C|3.0|I felt that the author did not develop the characters enough. Some just appeared without enough background and left you wondering.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing sequel to Bared to you!!! As with its predecessor, I couldn´t put this book down either!!!<br />It´s even more intense than the first, Eva and Gideon must face harder challenges together. Loved it, from beginning to end!<br />Don´t know what I´m going to do until the 3rd installment comes out!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so much fun everyone should play I would recommend this for a good stress relief game.  fun to play anywhere.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great book!  I can't wait for #3 in the series!  Great purchase!  Love the writing style of the author.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Adorable movie! I highly recommend it, it's funny and sweet and okay for teens to watch.<br />Surprisingly enough my male friend recommended it to me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just got this game a day ago and am already addicted. the horses are pretty and the interaction is nice.it's actually very relaxing and far less messy than a real horse. nothing against a horse; they are beautiful creatures.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A very \\" sweet and lovely\\" story. I too own an old copy of THE LANGUAGE Of FLOWERS...so was first enticed to read this book by the title alone. I was not disappointed. The writing is beautiful and found myself rereading sentences to absorb their deeper meaning.<br /><br />I really didn't want it to end so soon. I loved the ending though and how fun to read Victoria's dictionary and the author's note!<br /><br />Highly recommend this heartwarming story.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Adam Sandler plays a great Dracula. The story is cute & some of the characters resemble those in Monsters vs Aliens. My 8 yr old said it a must watch again movie!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is a nice break from from reading the long winded stories that seem to litter the landscape. A nice classic is always worth the read.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is fantastic for beginner/intermediate exercisers. I bought this workout DVD a year and a half ago and I'm still challenged by it. I haven't done the 30 day straight challenge, but have been content to use the video every other day or if the weather outside prohibits me from leaving my home.<br /><br />What I like:<br />1) The workouts are easy to learn and there are modified versions for almost every exercise.<br />2) The workouts are effective, challenging your muscles and heart. I never fail to hit target heart rate with this one.<br />3) The workouts are quick, warm up through cool down takes just under a half hour.<br />4) The workouts require limited equipment, all you need is hand weights.<br /><br />Cons:<br />5) For an advanced exerciser, i.e. someone who eats, sleeps and breathes circuit training, this video might not be challenging enough.<br /><br />All in all, for the average human this video is an incredible deal.
0544045203|5.0|I purchased this after hearing that a movie was made from it.  Very entertaining and well written.  I highly recommend.
0062014102|5.0|I first heard about this book when it was mentioned in one of the Conversations with God books by Neale Donald Walsch.  It sounded so fascinating that I just had to read it.<br /><br />It's by far one of the most eye-opening books I've read in a long time.  Many of the things outlined in it I've never even heard before, yet this book has been around since the 90s and many of the ideas aren't exactly new.<br /><br />Basically this books delves into science and gives compelling evidence saying that the universe is like a hologram and our brains are also hologram-like in nature.  So it's our brain which interprets the world around us and makes it appear solid and real.  Many people already acknowledge that seemingly solid objects aren't really solid and that, at the quantum level, we're all connected.  But science doesn't seem to want to acknowledge any other crazy ideas that can't be proven.<br /><br />I definitely think it's hard to really be objective and know anything for certain. Everything we know and experience is filtered through our brain and human body, so it's impossible for us to know if we're really experiencing reality as it appears to us.  So just because something can't be scientifically proven doesn't mean it isn't fact. There's still so much we don't know and I think it's helpful to keep an open mind.<br /><br />Many of the subjects brought up I used to dismiss or never give a passing thought.  But the more I learn about spirituality and all the other levels of existence that we don't know much about, the more open I become to new ideas.  This book discussed out of body experiences, near death experiences, past lives, UFOs, telepathy, time travel (into the future and past), materialization of objects out of thin air, and so much more.<br /><br />What's even more interesting is that many of these weird or strange things might have actual explanations which are real but simply can't be proven by science.  I found it to be a completely new way of looking at the world around us, one that is probably very close to the truth.  This book also referenced a bunch of other books which I was frantically keeping track of and now want to read even more about pretty much everything mentioned in this book.<br /><br />So if you're curious about how the universe works and what we might be missing by sticking to the strict guidelines of science, or if you just want to have your mind blown, then definitely check out this book.  It's not overly scientific and I found it very easy to read and understand.at the world around us, one that is probably very close to the truth.

B000002KET|5.0|This was the fifth Sabbath album I bought in the mid 80's.  I have to admit it took a little bit of time to appreciate it.  Once I did, I realized this was more than a album.  It was their masterpiece.  The songs I liked right off the bat were the title track and Killing Yourself to Live, and to this day I think these two tracks are right up there with Paranoid, Iron Man and Children of the Grave.  The rest of the tracks grew on me over time.  There is A National Acrobat which is spacey as it sounds.  Then there is Fluff, another sophisticated guitar solo.  Next we have Sabbra Cadabra - heavy guitars combined with synthesizers.  Then there is Who are You - more spacey synthesizers.  Next we have Looking for Today - sort of a popish but yet heavy song.  Then finally Spiral Architect - a song of loud music, orchestra and a audience at the end.  If you want an example of just how sophisticated heavy music can be, one look no further than Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.  The album has aged rather well too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I I I I II love temple run and temple run two is even awsomer. I am addicted to it.
0316069884|4.0|Wow, what an eye-opening book!  I've always considered myself to be a person who eats pretty healthily and is very conscious of what I put into my body.  I'm not a huge animal lover but that doesn't mean animals should be treated cruelly.  I never used to think eating animals was wrong or really bad for people, let alone the environment.<br /><br />Due to my interest in healthy eating I'm aware of toxins and things being put in food to make it last longer or grow faster, for example.  Documentaries like Food, Inc. gave some insights into farming and where our food comes from.  But I never really grasped the impact of what it takes for us to have the food we eat until I read this book.<br /><br />So here are some of the things I learned:<br /><br />Animals are treated very cruelly in order to be bred and killed for food<br />Some of this treatment is inflicted by the people working with animals<br />Other horrific things happen due to flaws in the machinery and process of butchering animals<br />Many of these things could be avoided if the goal wasn't to mass produce meat<br />Animals are bred to be sick and deformed because it's cheaper to do so<br />Consequently, animals are fed anti-biotics and other toxins to keep them alive<br />All these terrible things go into the meat we eat, making us sick<br />Scientists predict that the next pandemic (e.g. bird flu or swine flu) will come about because of this<br />In addition to what animals are fed, the mass production of animals means they aren't butchered cleanly and a lot of fecal matter and other dirty things end up in the food we eat, making us sick.<br />Factory farming is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation<br />Waste from factory farms is polluting the ground and water as well as making people sick<br /><br />So, what can we do about it?<br /><br />Stop eating meat!  Or only eat meat which is produced in a responsible way.<br /><br />Foer states, \\"Just as nothing we do has the direct potential to cause nearly as much animal suffering as eating meat, no daily choice we make has a greater impact on the environment.\\"<br /><br />The message I received was quite simple.  Basically, people are demanding more meat at a cheaper price.  The only way to meet these demands is through factory farming which is destroying animals, people, and the environment.  Just because meat is cheap at the grocery store doesn't mean the costs aren't felt elsewhere.  We've been choosing cheap meat over our health and the health of our planet.  Will it really matter if we can eat a $1 burger when the air we're breathing is toxic, there's no drinkable water, or even worse, we're dead because of it?<br /><br />It was this environmental aspect which really hit home for me.  If we care about our world and want to live long and healthy lives, something's got to give.  One of the reasons I picked up this book was because I was doing a 30 day experiment to test drive being a vegetarian. It's something I always wanted to do just to see what it would be like.  After reading this book I'm going to stick with it and maybe even go slightly vegan (no eggs and dairy) now that I know the negative effects my choices have on the world around me.<br /><br />So even if you think eating animals is perfectly fine, then consider the environment. Consider your health and the health of your family.  Consider the health of our planet and go read this book to get informed!ntial to cause nearly as much animal suffering as eating meat, no daily choice we make has a greater impact on the environment.\\"<br /><br />The message I received was quite simple.

B000002KE2|5.0|Well I started listening to Sabbath in the mid 80's when I was 16 and this just happened to be the fourth album I got and would get the rest of them with Ozzy singing in the order released.  I said this about the first three albums and I find myself saying it again, I was blown away when I first heard it.  It still stands the test of time.  A lot of people don't understand the song FX.  It to me sounds like lost spirits on a dark night and then goes into one of their heaviest tracks ever Supernaut.  They did the opposite with Children of the Grave.  There you get the heavy stuff first then get the lost spirits at the end of the song using distorted guitars and bases.  Both had marvelous results and both were originally at the end of side one of the vinyl records. Some other great tunes on this album are Wheels of Confusion, Tommorows Dream, Snowblind and Under the Sun.  A lot of people refer to this as the drugged album and after one listen you will understand why.  After all the original title for this record was Snowblind, but the record company said no way.  This album would lead into their next record \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" which was perhaps the bands masterpiece.
B000KZBRG6|5.0|bought it as a starters and the results were sooo good I ended loving it to the point I dont plan on buying the 308 !!!! the battery lasts for ever just remember to use the reflected setting and if your subject it near a strong light try to aim at the floor or adjust by 2 stops

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The movie was very true to the book. I enjoyed both. Very good story. I will watch the movie again.
B000002KB8|5.0|I was about 16 years old when I saw this album in the record store.  This was in the mid 80's when Sabbath's future was unknown.  What I did not know is that Ozzy was in this band and the album was released in 1970.  I was mesmerized by the cover art.  I was into Led Zeppelin at this point and suspected Sabbath was their rivals.  There was an underground metal station in my area that played songs off of Paranoid and Master of Reality.  I got those albums first and of course was blown away by what I heard.  So the next album I got from this band was this one \\"Black Sabbath\\" and I was not familiar with any of the tracks.  Needless to say I was blown away by this album as well.  Sabbath became my favorite band at this point.  I liked just about everything on this album.  As a result I started getting into a lot of bands like Deep Purple, Uriah Heep and Blue Oyster Cult.  To this day I still like a lot of these bands because they knew how to rock unlike most of the corporate garbage of the 80's.  That is until a little band from Seattle named Nirvana came on the scene and brought back real rock and blew everybody away and all those garbage bands of the 80's careers were over.  Getting back to Sabbath - their first five albums are all classics and belong in any heavy rock collection.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I LOVE to read and I have never felt compelled to write a review on Amazon, until now! This book had me riveted the entire way through and never got boring to me. Andy Weir needs to write more books, and charge more for the next one! At $.99 you should pick it up now!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very addicting!! But super fun! You will always have something to do, this game never gets boring. And to be honest it makes u feel like u do own ure own horse, an it's just an amazing experience!! Experience it for your self
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|First, it was free, so the price was great.  Many formats to choose from. Some of the tiles look alike, which I guess is the purpose of making it a bit harder.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What makes this book so great is that things just fit. The story is interesting and never drags, never gets bland. It keeps you guessing, there are twists you wouldn't expect. Characters feel real, everything in this book feels natural in fact. Details about the silo, character actions, social structure, etc. The story simply unfolds, at no point in the book did i feel like something happened to drive the story, it all just flows together.<br /><br />The book is also beautifully written. There are enough descriptions about the surroundings, technical stuff, how characters feel to paint a picture, to allow you to immerse yourself into the world - but never more than that. You are never told what's going on, you are shown.<br /><br />This book is just expertly crafted, to sum it up<br />- naturally unfolding story<br />- no obvious plot holes<br />- naturally acting characters, no horror-movie-esque characters that just do something royally stupid for no reason<br />- descriptive enough to be immersive with no babbling, no 1 page long pointlessly poetic descriptions of scenery with 30 bad metaphors in them, no pointless dialog trying to drive home some philosophical point<br />- great pacing, \\"twists\\" in the story that never let it go bland<br /><br />You will like it if you like detective novels, thrillers, fallout (the game) :), fantasy, sci-fi, ...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is so so so awesome!!!! I love this app u should get it! This app is for someone who is adventurous
B0032FPVKE|4.0|This bag has good quality and construction. It's a nice size for my mid size camera. Great padding to protect the contents.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Huge fan of the original version of Subway Surfer, just started playing the Rio version of the game. Observations so far lots of glitches, game very choppy, speeds up way faster than original version did so will take some getting used to. Will play for a couple more days before I decide to move on to a better game.
B000N2HBSO|3.0|This is an interesting interplay of the narratives that surrounded and may be compared to the narrative of the life of Lincoln.  It is an interesting approach; but at times tends to be tedious in the reading.  At other times there are insights and snipits of history that make the effort a worthy one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love  this game!!!! I hope they come out with a third!!!! I totally recommend this to everyone:) Favorite game on my on my kindle!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|More thrilling and challenging than the first.  Love the zip lines, mine carts and the spiked rollers.  The details are also great!
B0060AY85C|5.0|A forceful, beautifully crafted book, more optimistic than many of her works. Reader is left wanting the story to continue.
0761169253|5.0|I read the blog post that inspired the book last year, and it really changed the way I thought about my work. This is a great set of tips for creative people to do their best work and get recognized for it.
B000FVE3A2|5.0|It sounds like I'm joking but you can leave one of the weights off your dive belt this will help get you to the bottom of the ocean.I love the look of this thing it's big and solid and weighs about a pound. It has solid end links, machined clasp, and a very hefty bracelet.The watch itself has a very reliable seiko hackable automatic movement +/- 5 seconds a day which is very compairable to some more expensive watches. The fit and finish is equal to the Orient Mako XL that I own.Worth every penny I gave for it ! Take the plunge but don't drown in debt very reasonable very heavy great deal go for it.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I felt like there were cuts out of some of the big numbers. Could have been much better. I loved the show.
B004EAFQG0|5.0|It was very very good. I enjoyed it. I also love the television show which is on MTV on Mondays.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|I chose to give this movie two star because i did not like the story. It was so sad. I would not watch this movie if you have a dog or pet that you love. Even though i love tim burton films, this one is not one of his best. It reminded me of 9, another depressing movie by tim, which i also would not watch. movies are supposed to be entertaining and uplifting, not make you cry
B0083Z614S|5.0|Like most books, this one is a lot better than its movie.  It is written so beautifully that it just sweeps you away to another world, and you feel as if you live on the moor and Misselthwaite too.  This is the best classic I've ever read!
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This movie was very spiritual for me.  It juxaposed real life situations against the marvel of the environment we live in.  The filming was extraordinary.  I cried with the pain of the humans and the beauty of the world.  At the end I was changed to a better human being myself.  I honestly believe that every note of the music in this film came from my favorite music that I have listened to all of my life.
B0053FANRC|5.0|This is a fun movie. It's predictable as are the rest of the Fast & Furious movies, but it is still a great movie...again, the cars are great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awsome game for horse lovers even if u have horses.it is still fun. i love it my 13 yr old loves it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The Best Game That Ever  Existed Since The Beginning Of The Kindle Fire Love The Game It Is A Great Game For The Kindle Fire It Is Better Than The First Temple Run In Every Way.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am still reading the book and I am loving every word of it.  I have loved Abraham Lincoln all of my life and even love him more now if that indeed is possible.
B0053FANT0|5.0|The cars are great! None of these movies have a complicated plot or unpredictable story line, but who cares?! The cars are cool!!
B009POHHRG|4.0|Th story is great, I love the art work, but there was a lot less comic than I would have expected for ten dollars. I guess my ignorance is partly to blame for that, but I think something closer to five dollars would have been more appropriate. Especially for a digital copy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|its a different and exciting way to play solitaire. i play it mostly on down time at work . very easy and fun
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|I didnt watch it in 3D yet, but I did enjoy the movie. Maybe it will make kids change their mind about wanting to be with other parents he he lol
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I read this book as part of a book study in the school I work in.  As a member of the Autism Cadre I try very hard to understand what the students I work with are actually thinking and why.  This book is written from the point of view of an Autistic boy.  It helped me better understand what several of my students were going through.  But you need to remember that not all people with Autistism are alike.  In fact their symptoms, severity, and rituals vary greatly.  If you have met one person with autism, then that is just one person with autism.<br /><br />I loved this book.  It opened my eyes to this childs mind, but told a wonderful story at the same time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Even more fun than the original! I love it and so do my kids. Hours of addicting game play. Highly recommended.
B00A757EFW|3.0|i really havent had the time to play with it. will try to play sometime this week maybe today or tomorrow
B0030SZ2D4|5.0|Cant wait for the next one to come out! They shouldnt make you write more than a few works to rate this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is just like described. you unlock games as you complete them and earn points.there are ads but that was also something I was expecting for a free game. nice variety of games
0761169253|5.0|Austin Kleon--the self described writer who draws--brings us a great new addition to the library of creative rah, rah, rah books.<br /><br />\\"What's that?\\" you ask. Creative rah, rah, rah books are the ones you read that get you all fired up about being an artist. They remind you why you do what you do and give you that shot of inspiration. Some of my creative rah, rah, rah books include Walking on Water by Madeleine L'Engle, Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott and On Writing by Stephen King. They're the kind of books you should re-read every so often, the books you underline and quote and remember.<br /><br />Steal Like an Artist is one you should add to your library. It's a great little kick in the pants for creative types. Even if your job title doesn't include designer, writer or creative something.

B00B0NDF26|5.0|I heard that this album was supposed to be more like Pop music.  I can see what critics are talking about.  I think they executed it.  Very catchy songs! Love it!
B000GRUMPU|2.0|The audiences of 2006 are unlikely to think back on this remake of \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" (1972) and recall it fondly. It's too big, too glitzy, too harsh and, with the exception of Mia Maestro and Richard Dreyfuss, the characters elicit little sympathy from us. There's nothing special to remember. The little band of actors in the original treatment did a great deal more with just an expression or a quick line of dialogue than this group is able to. Instead there is a lot of looking up with open mouths and squinting eyes, but no depth to the actors' horror.<br /><br />The computer-generated effects and the smaller scale of television do make this a better view on DVD, however. In the theatre, the claustrophobic quality generally went missing as it sprawled across the screen. The animation is always obvious.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some scenes that will leave you literally holding your breath. There is one scene that suggests the drowning of a 10-year-old boy that couldn't feel more cruel. This is not for children. As for the big capsizing scene, it disappoints, despite the lurid details of seeing every possible nook and cranny of the ship as it goes over. Nothing is left to the imagination. The body count only comes across as vicious.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this show...  I went into it sort of wanting an action adventure type show...  maybe with some minor romance...  Good vs Evil...  But didn't expect too much.<br /><br />It has been a FUN show...  lots of action...definitely good vs. evil...but with lots of mystery...sneakiness lurking in the back ground..  You get glimpses each week of SOME of the horrors he survived on the island...but you still don't know that whole sorry...bits and pieces...  You also keep learning bits and pieces of other evil people lurking about...  but while all that is in the story...there is the 'week to week' crime to solve...<br /><br />AND While the star of the show is easy on the eyes...don't let it fool you into thinking it is a 'chic' show...  my husband watches it with me and he was surprised to find he enjoys it as well!
B004J4WN0I|4.0|This one kept popping up in my Amazon \\"also bought\\" lists, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  It's an urban fantasy with ancient Irish gods, fairies, and druids fast forwarded to the twentieth century which has picked up its share of modern supernatural guys along the way.<br /><br />The protagonist is a druid named Atticus.  Well, that's what he's calling himself these days, since not many folks in modern Arizona can handle his original name from sometime in the BC range.  He runs an occult bookstore and tea shop, selling crystals and tarot cards to the wannabes and the occasional arcane text to the real practitioners.  His lawyers (a vampire and a werewolf) keep him out of trouble - or at least try - but there's not much they can do about his god problems.<br /><br />And what would those be?  Well, it seems he stole a sword in an epic battle a few thousand years ago, and its self-proclaimed \\"rightful owner\\" has been hunting for it ever since.  Now those efforts have shifted into high gear, and Atticus is getting tired of hiding.  Throw in a few witches and the occasional incarnation of Death (some sexy, some not so much), and it's a regular menagerie of the supernatural.<br /><br />By and large, I liked it, and I might continue reading the series.  I suppose my only complaint is that the magic seemed too easy.  That may just be the result of this druid's thousands of years of practice, but for just starting into the series, he was a little too accomplished for my taste.  It's not that I require all my magical heroes to start off as neophytes, but it's nice seeing them stumble and survive during those early years.  It makes them seem more human rather that arrive as demigods on page 1.
B003OOVVH0|3.0|I have just recently discovered Torchwood, and am loving the series! However, this particular episode is kind of a snoozer. I'm having a hard time caring what happens to Eugene. I'm hanging with it, because (like Doctor Who), you can miss a large meaning in a small detail. But I *almost* want to fast-forward this one.
B00979CS50|1.0|Gather round again little boys and girls for another attempt by Neil Young to add more money to the millions of dollars he already has by selling meaningless music to the masses. Neil Young has made a great deal of money on an image that glamorizes a deadbeat why work for a living Image . Neil Young's reputation and image has done more for glamorizing life on public assistance than anyone in the entertainment industry. He's the perfect image of a idler  and his image reflects such. This new CD is just another reminder of how Neil Young can make such meaningless music and people like sheep will purchase it. It's really sad when you think about it when there's so much one can do with one's money instead of wasting it on meaningless items such as this. There are so many environmental causes  that are in great need of financial support. I asked anyone who has not purchased this horrible CD to not waste their money on such paltry and to think about possibly using the money towards something more meaningful such as environmental causes helpless animals in shelters across the United States. If that choice doesn't make sense to you and Neil Young hopes it doesn't and you can continue to be one of the many gullible Americans who continue to buy such lousy music that Neil Young has been manufacturing for years-then you only confirm what Neil Young's approach has been for years which is never underestimate the vulnerability of Americans-I-Neil Young have millions of dollars to prove it.  A persons character is reflected in their music-Neil Young has never been able to excute anything higher than his hubris character has been able to inspire! Which is not much !!!Granted years ago he wrote some beautiful songs-most of which are often so ambiguious( Heart Of Gold, Through my Sails,Harvest, Only love can break your Heart , Human Highway, Comes a time a few others) all of which can be compiled into one record or CD.If anything the bootlegers of the early seventies recorded the best of Neil Young.  How can you say this about Neil Young- your right he has done some benifit concerts for charity -which is good for his image(god knows he needs it) but any tax lawyer will tell you that its a profitable tax right off for millionaires-a tax loop whole that should be closed!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is not my intention to obtrude my opinion or stretch the seams on the ignorant ignobles who make up the vicarious fanatic fan base of Neil Young.For public opinion is a weak tyrant!I only mean to point out that I have no doubt that listening to this Neil Young CD many years from now will surely result in a mental illness diagnosis(presumablly an anti social personality disorder). For current evidence and proof please see invidious comments regarding this review.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most amazing game and I really love the world tour and the themes about the holidays . But only one thing, I would really like the arrows that are at the characters shop. But this game is still amazing.
1599290634|4.0|The Spectrum books are always a perennial favorite around my house.  My wife and I have been collection SF/F art prints for ages, and this book highlights all those artists we either missed or couldn't afford.  On technical merits, it's a great book, printed with good colors on sturdy paper.  It's going to be on my shelf for decades.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's addictive can't stop playing it that's the reason for the five stars.  Things that suck are it crashes occasionally when you go to use  gem to save yourself and you lose those gems.  Other than its a great game.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Colleen Hoover has officially become one of my favorite authors!!!  I loved this story and was so sad when it was over.  I can't wait to get started on her next book!!
B006Z7Z3S6|1.0|In all honesty, if I see one more cat jump out from behind a door, I'm going to shoot my television.  I just can't bring myself to understand why anyone, ANYONE, would think that that was a good idea.  As a film director, how can you justify building a suspenseful sequence around an animal of any sort, but especially a cat, making noise in a dark corner and then popping out just when you think you're about to see something really terrifying?  It's beyond my comprehension.<br /><br />That being said, a stupid scene like the one mentioned would not and should not be enough to entirely write off any horror film.  It happens so often in horror films that you'd basically have to write them all off.  What CAN cause you to write off a horror film would be the fact that it just isn't scary.  I'm struggling because I honestly can't decide whether or not this was supposed to be taken seriously.  Maybe this was supposed to be a comedy or a spoof, you know, like `Scary Movie', but I know that it's not and that makes me confused.  This has got to be one of the most unintentionally funny films I've ever seen.  Each scene looks like something out of a poorly crafted comedy.  It reminds me of when I saw `Darkness Falls' and I laughed throughout, which is not the reaction you want from a horror film.<br /><br />Clich&eacute;s abound in this messy film that centers on a haunted hotel that is going out of business.  The employees are obsessed with the rumors surrounding the ghost haunting the hotel and they do everything they can to stir stuff up.  God, none of this works.  The performances are so affected and mannered and just bad and the direction is completely uninspired.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of bad films this year, but this may be the worst.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This is the third book in the Old Man's War series, and it unites the storylines of the first two books.  John Perry has been returned to human form, and Jane Sagan has been made human as well.  They married and settled down on a world named Huckleberry, adopting Zoe, the orphaned daughter of a brilliant traitor.<br /><br />Everything was going fine, and then the Colonial Union asked them for a little favor.<br /><br />So John, Jane, Zoe, and the rest of their household are off to form a new colony on Roanoke, except this is no ordinary colony.  It's a mix-mash of divergent cultures and almost seems designed to fail.  And then they get the rug pulled out from under them when it turns out the Colonial Union has been... shall we say, less than truthful.  From there it's an engaging story of setting up a colony under less than ideal circumstances, hiding from aliens, and discovering the truth about what's really going on.<br /><br />This was probably my favorite of the series so far.  It was all fresh material, and there were lots of problems to be solved, both practical and political.  John, Jane, and Zoe all did humanity proud, even if it wasn't always what the Colonial Union wanted.  They also peeled the lid off of a static situation, and I'll be interested to see where the story goes from here.<br /><br />So, if you faltered during the Ghost Brigades, pick this one up and keep on marching.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|FUN TO PLAY AND GREAT COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO LOVE BINGO. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND TO ANY ONE WHO LOVES THE GAME
B00APUYN0I|2.0|I really expected more, considering the reviews. It all seemed a bit jumbled and unfinished  Still better than &#34;Glee&#34; though.
B005LAIGPU|4.0|The whole hand held camera phase has become this big thing that you either love or you hate.  Many are vocal about hating it entirely and wishing that it had never been started.  I'm not one of those.  I mean, I am not a giant fan of it but I understand its purpose and find that the gimmick, when used correctly, can be fun.  I loved `Cloverfield'.  Maybe too much, but then again I'm not ashamed of that at all.  Many blame `Cloverfield' for the craze, and they are probably partially justified since that film did become a sort of `thing' for a while.<br /><br />Hate on the gimmick all you want, but `Chronicle' proves that it can be utilized to seeming perfection.<br /><br />`Chronicle' is a story of three teens who stumble across what appears to be an alien entity that gives them bizarre powers of mind control that allow them to become superheroes.  What teenage boy doesn't want to do that.  What `Chronicle' explores after the initial power surge is the impact that power has on the weak and the way it warps the mind and eventually controls it.  As a whole, it does a decent job of that.  The performances are well grounded, especially from Dane DeHaan who grapples with the darkness aspect of the transformation really well.  I was really impressed with the special effects, which were NOT perfect, but considering the budget and the overall visual scope of the film, they were truly effective.<br /><br />The finale builds in a really aggressive nature.  I liked that.  Still, there is something missing here.  As much as I liked this film, it felt almost as if the themes present weren't completely manipulated correctly, like it was enough just to present them and not necessarily develop them.<br /><br />Still, I highly recommend it.  It is intense and exciting and does a lot of things right.

0920668372|5.0|I recently purchased a copy for a baby shower because I know how much my son and I still enjoy it. I've read this to him since he was a baby but as he's grown older (4 years) it has become one of his picks. We both love the story, it gets to me emotionally every time. Most recently my son loves it because he has to pipe in &#34;DON'T CRY MAMA&#34; several times before we get to the end. Mothers of little boys this is a must!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover, you completely rock!!!!!  I enjoyed reading this book so much.  When I read the end, I just smiled & turned to my husband & sighed... well done, if your looking for a really good read, this is your book.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved reading The Pact. I finished it in 2 days because I couldnt put it down.  Jodi Picoult touches deep into your emotions with this book.  A sad  love story that left you wondering how it would finish.  This book  is a great read, one that I would highly recommend.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Considering the story takes place over several months in a single room, this was surprisingly very engaging. I was surprised to find that Sanderson, who is known for writing 800-1000 page monsters, was able to write a 180 page novella that feels like a complete story without cutting anything short.
B005LAIGSC|5.0|This is a great, modern action/drama flick.  LOTS of action; lots of things getting blown up.  Fast-action car chase scenes, etc....<br /><br />I generally like Denzel Washington's movies, and this is no exception.  Saw it a number of times on the large cinema screen when it first came out.

But then again five stars, well it is the Marauder's Map - any HP-fans dream!
1849386684|5.0|I've recently started taking online guitar lessons by Justin and this book of his is the perfect companion to the beginner course. There are 10 songs to learn for each level of the course. The songs are specific to the chords learned. They are all popular songs, most of which you will recognize. The songbook is easy to follow, along with the course. The book was shipped from England and came 3 weeks earlier than expected, which was great.

1616550414|5.0|This book truly does justice to The Legend of Zelda franchise. Honestly it is much wider and thicker then I expect it to be. It is, a little wider than the Japanese version, so Dark Horse can translate the art footnotes in an easier to read format, but I'll touch on that later. Beginning the book is an introduction from famed creator of many Nintendo franchise, including The Legend of Zelda, Shigeru Miyamoto! From there, the book is separated into three sections, \\"The Legend Begins\\" which contains plenty of concept art and character designs from Skyward Sword, \\"The History of Hyrule\\" which includes the official series timeline, and an in depth and detailed of important plotlines and sections of each game and how they fit into the timeline, and finally, the \\"Creative Footprints\\" section, which includes concept art and character designs for the rest of the Zelda games, from the first Zelda to Spirit Tracks (Skyward Sword is already thoroughly covered in \\"The Legend Begins\\" section, there is no more artwork for the game in this section). There is some nice little extra sections, one titled \\"Changes in Character Design\\" and one tilted \\"Game Catalog\\". They are nice, short little sections that I won't spoil for you. Ending the book is a 32 page manga from Akira Himekawa, the creator of the other The Legend of Zelda mangas, along with a nice closing message from Eiji Aounuma, a very important director and producer of the Legend of Zelda series from Ocarina of Time and up. This book is certainly packed to the brim with concept art, storylines, and interesting tidbits of the series. For $20 on Amazon, or even for it's $34.99 MSRP, you are getting more then your moneys worth.<br /><br />All of this plethora of content is wrapped in a very organized and pretty package. The presentation, especially for the money, is top notch. The cover itself is outstanding, with the gold foil lettering and Gate of Time symbol brillantly standing out on an equally brilliant green background. The pages are of a pretty good quality, making the art very clear and colorful, and are just an absolute pleasure to look at. Back onto the topic of the art footnotes, Dark Horse has done an excellent job translating them. Not only that, the fonts used are very crisp, clear and easy to read, making the bigger size of the book worth it. They may not be the unchanged handwritten footnotes of the Japanese version of the book, but it's a small sacrifice to actually be able to understand and read them easily. Also, there has been some concerns that increasing the size of the book would stretch some of the art. I, for one, haven't noticed any stretched images, although I don't have the Japanese book to accurately compare. Anyways, the background of each page looks browned, making it feel like you are reading through an ancient tome pulled right out of a Hylian library. It's little touches like these that makes the book such a special and pleasurable read. The quality of this book, once again, exceeds the price you pay for it.<br /><br />Let's dig a little more into the sections, the meat of the book. The first and third section, \\"The Legend Begins\\" and \\"Creative Footprints\\" contain beautiful artwork from each main game in the series. There is plenty of sketches, colored drawings, and paintings of various concept art found in each game, as well as for character designs, including some different character designs that haven't even made it into the game! An example, Fi has some pretty cool designs, including, but not limited too, a purple ninja design, a more bell shaped design, and even a heavily armored \\"Iron Man\\" design! It's nice to see these early, discarded ideas for some of the characters in the series, as it shows you just what really went into making these characters, their personalities, and functions so unique. There is this same level of treatment given into the concept art for areas within each game. Early sketches and drawings and the designer notes show the progression of the development process, and what the developers wanted out of each game. It's truly great seeing how these games came to be, and makes you appreciate the games even more! Onto the Second Section of the book \\"The History of Hyrule\\". This section contains the official timeline of the series, with later pages elaborating on how each game fits into the timeline. They truly did a great job summarizing key plot points of each game. There is also some extra lore that is placed in between some games. It helps ties the games together in the timeline, without taking anything away from the lore already established. All of this contained into a neatly organized sections, with each page labeled with the \\"era\\" and game that pages lore falls into. It is an interesting read that I would recommend anyone to look through, no matter what timeline theory you adhere to.<br /><br />Each section is brilliantly crafted, and filled with plenty of interesting art and information. The extras compliment what is an already excellent book. The presentation is wonderfully done. There aren't really any complaints I have with this book. It is an excellent tribute to The Legend of Zelda, and is worth a look from any ardent Zelda fan, and even worth a look from artists. Whether you are a Zelda fan, an artist, or someone looking for a great gift, you needn't look no futher then the Hyrule Historia.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is awesome Untill it stopped working. I have a kindle fire that is almost brand new. I tried to redownload this but it still won't work.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved loved loved this book.  The writing style was perfect in that, it wasn't over detailed but gave enough detail to put you in the moment and really feel the characters and their way of life at the time.  I still think about the characters once in a while and that's when I know the book really touched me.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|If you liked Fall of Giants this is a must read.  I couldn't stop reading about the families and the consequences of war and conscience.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A lot of fun, my family had read it, I should have gotten to it sooner. Give it a read.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|Just ok.  Predictable.  Henry Cavill turned in a good performance.  Same for Willis.  Sigourneys performance was not up to snuff IMO.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I really liked the beginning and then it just became very long and drawn out.  I didn't like the ending at all.  Unfortunately it was a waste of time to me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is totally cool an addicting. I play it all day. They will never take it down unless I say so. I love it so so much. no doubt
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I thought that the movie was very good.  It had some scenes that could have been better and I thought that clint was rather hoarse, but all in all the movie had a pretty smooth movement to it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|A true gem of the series. A lot of questions were answered finally and even more revealed. I loved this book
B006LSZECO|5.0|Book was a quick, engaging read w/ lots of twists. Amazon's service was very quick! I would definitely recommend this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  There were many times when I could not put it down.  The way Colleen Hoover writes makes you feel like you are in love all over again, but also in the middle of huge conflicts along the way.  I am hoping this book will have a sequel just so I can read about the characters again.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|this is a great movie! I watched it with a woman I was caring for and she really liked it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book is every bit as good as the first and delves deeper into what makes Lisbeth who she is! Definitely worth every cent!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What can I say - superb acting, intelligent writing and vivid imagery. It's got it all. I will never stop watching.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|I liked this movie just like I liked the previous one. They are good for entertainment and do like the special effects a lot. To me the last one was the best of the whole series.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I love New Girl because it it so stinkin' funny and I love rewatching episodes now because I own it on DVD!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I<3this book! It was non stop thrills! Wait,why am I reviewing a book? Everyone knows  that all books I read are awesome. So, TTYL! Or probably not.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|What a good movie.  I really enjoyed it need more movies like this one.  Keeps your interest through the whole movie.
B00B780TAK|2.0|I was waiting and waiting for Season 3 and so far it's been total dissapointment...the plot is so old Edith at the church, the cancer scare, the shirts dissapear etc etc nothing new. This would not have cut it for the SAG award which they won for Season 2. Now I know why Dan Stevens ran for the hills - this will probably be the last season of Downton Abbey!
B008476HBM|5.0|In high school, my enjoyment of old European art was always hampered by my gratitude that I'm not any of these exasperating people or in any of their stifling situations. I felt so blessed and superior that I escaped sitting around mending bonnets all day, waiting to go on a walk- how boring and pathetic! Upon rereading this years later, I was able to let go of these old prejudices and more objectively view the characters in the situation they were in. That was when I realized Austen is a genius: I saw how much she understands and subtly, humorously conveys, and how little I'd understood before. Now I actually consider this to be a work of rationalist literature, in addition to a brilliant romantic comedy.<br /><br />In my previous reading, I thought that the only intelligent, reasonable character was Mr. Darcy, and that everyone else's problems was brought on by their own idiocy, of which their unjust hatred of the virtuous, blameless Mr. Darcy was only further evidence. This time around, I realized that he caused some of these problems himself. Mr. Darcy's arrogance caused problems he could've easily avoided by being slightly nicer. Instead, he prided himself in his bluntness and in his own virtuousness, thus causing people to resent him, because who likes someone who thinks he's better than you, even if he actually is? Similarly, Lizzy demonstrates all of our tendencies to like and be less questioning of information coming from someone who flatters us. This causes us to have errors in judgment and believe things we would otherwise be more critical of. Mr. Darcy shows an amazing ability to step outside personal biases and view things from other's perspectives- a rationalist romantic hero! Austen understood the female wish: a rich, moral, loyal man completely rational about all things, except for his irrational love for his weird woman.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It's good. I enjoyed it. I recommend it to anyone who likes love stories. Funny plot good story line bye
B007KOMTUI|3.0|I love Mad Men, but this wasn't my favorite season. I do like how the characters are developing and the show seems to have gotten back to the core of what made it work well to start, so that's promising.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|Anybody that has NOT seen this movie is really missing out. One of my favorite movies to date! GREAT MOVIE!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book from start to finish. The characters were so engaging. I wish there was a sequel!
B0035FQ1UU|5.0|My gf and I saw this on the day the world was supposed to end. Hot coffee + this movie = good night in.
1595828753|4.0|We bought three of these books for our 9 year old granddaughter.  She is happy with reading this type of story, and with photos makes it more delightful.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Although the book was sometimes hard to read because of the events that happened, it was very well written and left me admiring Jaycee Dugard even more.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|If this was a standalone app, I could easily have given it 5 stars. However, as the sequel to Temple Run it lacks major improvements. This game is just a more graphically intensive Temple Run, except it's much more difficult to play one handed, much less fun/addictive, and much harder to advance in the game without spending money on in app purchases. Overall a slightly bland and dissapointing sequel to its imaginative and groundbreaking predecessor.
B009CPEOC4|4.0|Similar to the Justin Beiber one, just with the sexy Katy Perry. If you like her, it's interesting. Lot of focus on the relationship between her and Russel Brand (who's kind of an a-hole) to be honest.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love pinterest!!! im ADDICTED! its for everyone..theres something for everyone. enough said- just download it already!!! once you get the hang of it- very convienant
B006LSZECO|3.0|Although I found the complexity of the twists and turns by the author admirable, I found the book to be disbelievable. I think it would make a good Lifetime movie choice.
B006HGXGWU|1.0|I can't for the LIFE of me understand who would rate this movie at 5-stars, 4-stars, or even 3-stars!  120 minutes of my life I cannot get back.<br /><br />This is hands-down the most boring, uneventful waste of time I'd ever seen on film.<br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />To the reviewers who rated this an \\"excellent\\" or \\"good\\" movie, thanks for nothing.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I can't believe that there will be no more books!  The stories are amazing, the way you become part of the story and want to be part of the action is like no other book out there.
B00008RH3L|1.0|I had read so much about Millers Crossing and had never seen it. So sat down and watched in anticipation. What a bunch of garbage. I read all these 5 star reviews and really can not see what these people saw. Acting average at best, script pathetically inept and well it basically goes absolutely nowhere. I was left thinking that it is two hours of my life that I will never get back.<br />It is a film I will never watch again. One reviewer said every time he watches it (brave multiple viewer), he cannot find a flaw in the film...Wow really? Horrible.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I have only used this once but it does the trick and its free so what's not to like about that
B007SGM084|4.0|I had heard a lot about this series, but was still not sure I wanted to expose myself to the kinkiness of it all.  I had numerous friends that had read it and said that &#34;there really is a story in there.&#34;  So....I decided I would give it a try.  I was surprised on how much I really enjoyed the love story behind it all.  I'm a hopeless romantic, so I must admit that it reached my expectations there!<br /><br />I was actually disappointed when it was over.  I could have read more!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Right in line with the rest of the books in the series.  Can't wait till the fall to see where the next book is going?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this way of catching up on past seasons that I missed.  Fabulous set, clothing, story line - such a great series - thank you PBS
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a book that everyone should read to gain a better understanding of American history. It provides insights into the intellect and relationships of one of our greatest leaders - all based on historical fact!<br /><br />Encourage everyone to read this!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Great movie!! I really wasn't expecting much from this movie, but boy was I surprised. Told a story of family, tradition, persistent hope in the face of opposition. Really a great movie for the family or anyone!!
B00942Y4IY|5.0|If you are a scifi buff you will love this movie! Cool graphics and magnificent scenery!<br />I am going to buy it on DVD!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very good! Going to tell everyone to read this! Might read it again myself soon! Going to see the movie now!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I loved the step by step detail. It was very encouraging! I can't believe I am going to be my own publisher!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great!<br />I read all three in about a weeks time. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who has been thinking about reading these books
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this version for Kindle.  Good graphics and plays smoothly.  I've played Mahjong for a long long time and this version offers variety and challenge.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the best game of all-time<br /><br />This game is also vary addicting<br />This is a good time waster when you are bored<br />I &lt;3 this game
B00338QENI|5.0|This book discusses and explores many subjects through one woman's story and the story of her family.  Topics this book discusses include race relations, women's issues, poverty and wealth, privacy rights, patient rights, medical industry for profit and for non-profit, scientific and medical discovery, growth and understanding over the last 60 years, and many other matters I won't list out.  As I read this book, I have bent my poor husband's ear telling him all about it, what I think of what I'm reading and how it is impacting me.  I would really like to discuss this book at length with another person and hear what their take away messages are.  The author does an excellant job of presenting the story without judgement or hyperbole.  Hennerita Lacks immortal life is riviting.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Doesn't take too long to play, 2-4 people, still only 2 hours, easy to adapt to and simple rules<br /><br />Definitely worth buying
0802473156|5.0|This book saved my marrage!!!! I strongly suggest everyone read this book and think it should be required reading for antone who applies for a marrage license. I have been married for 31the years and wished I had found it 25I years ago! Thanks Dr. Chapman!

I cant believe this happened I am so mad now. I loved this game and played it every day.  now it let me down FIX THIS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A80SHFM|1.0|Not at all what I was expecting. Was hopin for more if a variety of songs that were not as popular to be included in the highlights.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|A friend recommended that I get it.  At first I puchased the free version, then soon found out that it is makes me laugh and smile while playing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Beyond the most amazing book! I never thought it'd be possible to fall in love with what seems to be a very attractive, rich character. It revealed some of my inner thoughts and at times had me thinking I was Christian Grey's women!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Had to use alot  of hints but really liked the game. Don't like that it wasn't a long enough game.
0230754686|5.0|Should be required reading for everyone.  Grim and insightful.  Google is just gettng enough information to put these secret slave camps on its maps of North Korea.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|work it, work it good. lol  It helps me workout.  What more can I say.  Wish when I turn my kindle the program would turn with it.
B0098XY5VK|5.0|Funny graphics/comic story along with an engaging game.  Love the different customers in the game & the different things you need to do.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Terrific game. Always learning a new strategy. Love that each scene different  . So addictive. I wake up and play immediately.

B003VANOFY|4.0|If I had the choice to do it again, I would most likely pass it up. While the sound quality is great, it doesn't block out surrounding sound too well plus the ear piece is uncomfortable after 30 minutes or so.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Prompt and secure delivery. I use my PSP for traveling or when I'm stuck sitting around waiting for an appointment. Movies on my PSP are a great way to pass time.

B00AAX68HG|2.0|No point to the game  I don't get why they made it it's terrible they could have Done so much better I'm disappointed they do have a good game called cut the rope though
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app works great on the Kindle Fire. Only downside is no camera built-in to post new items all from the KF, but you can use images from the gallery if you store them on the KF or able to sync them there.

B009UNH0EM|5.0|I purchased the Plantronics Legend at the recommendation of a coworker.  I found it to be one of the best headsets I've found.  Obviously, its true drawback is the proprietary charging mechanism.  I travel for work and found myself several hours from home without my charger.  I visited all of the local stores; Best Buy, Radio Shack, HH Greg, MicroCenter, and couldn't find a cable anywhere local.  I now have a tremendously long drive home without a working bluetooth.<br /><br />The moral of the story is to buy yourself at least one or two extras and keep them around.  If you don't, you won't be able to find one when you need it.

B002WYH5N2|5.0|I saw this on TV and enjoyed it tremendously, and had to own it. .....beautiful landscapes, scenes,  filming & actors- it was just awesome and more true to the book than others I own. (I had to even re-read the book to verify)

0385535147|4.0|As usual John Grisham grabs your interest immediately.  He is very good at weaving the background information intermittantly throughout the book.  You actually have to reach the end to put it all together.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book,except the violence was to much for me. I felt it was really too  realistic and  I know that everyday  people  live this kind of life and it saddens me that people working for the law or lawyers  and professional prominet people get away with things until its to late. I know a few cases personally that this happened to. I don't think I could watch the movie.

The quality, the design, the size, every aspect is outstanding.<br /><br />The LED is perfect for me, some say it isn't too bright, but it fits for me.<br />Sensitivity controls are amazing, & the ability to weight tone the mouse is great.<br />The price. The price is one of the best parts. This mouse sits on par with my brother's $70 RAZER gaming mouse.<br /><br />Get your's today.

0374214913|4.0|For any fan of books and reading, it sounds like a dream come true: a twenty-four hour bookstore, where you can show up anytime and be willingly accepted to browse the stacks and be surrounded by thousands of books and breathe in the literary scents.  But then there are some weird things going on at Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore during the early hours of the morning, as well as some very strange characters coming in.    Clay Jannon is unemployed and looking for anything that will bring in some money, after being dumped out of the web-design world with the tough recession; and it ain't cheap living in San Francisco.  And then one day he sees the help wanted sign at Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.  After having the interview and experimenting with going up the ladders that stretch high up the stacks of the three-story tall bookstore, he gets the job.  He works the nightshift from 10PM until 6AM, where Mr. Penumbra greets him in the early morning.  It seems like an easy job for okay pay, since there are hardly ever any customers.  At the front of the store is a small selection of regular selling books, but most of the store is taken up by unique and strange books all written in code.  Occasionally Clay gets customers coming into the story in the early hours of the morning, returning a book and borrowing a new one.  His job is to record the details and condition of these strange people in the great bookstore log.    As the story progresses, the curiosity grows and grows, for both Clay and the reader, wanting to know who these people are, what these coded books are all about, and what exactly it all means.  Clay wonders how a bookstore like this even stays in business.  And as he begins to dig deeper and deeper, he opens up the mystery and learns answers that lead to more questions and more curiosity.  The bookstore appears to be just the tip of the iceberg.    Robin Sloan's debut novel plays well on the enjoyment of the reader, as well as slowly unraveling the mystery, in addition to taking the reader around San Francisco and into the heart of the Googleplex, and then across the country and back in time through a hidden history, all on the subject of books and their meaning.  Readers will be hooked with Sloan's easy reading style and curious tale until the very end.    Originally written on November 10, 2012 ©Alex C. Telander.    For more reviews, go to Bookbanter: [...]
B009K0P10K|4.0|I simply find it that it is not like the first season - not seamlessly threaded like the first season was. The first season kept me hooked and looking forward to consequent episodes. The episodes on Season 2 seem fragmented and not fluid enough.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I love a good film ... even if it's animated. It's kinda sad what humans have done. Well done. I highly recommend it.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|There are some songs on here that sound original - radioactive, demons, top of the world etc. But there are other ones that also sound very commercial. They aren't bad, they just are not my favorite either.
1401235166|4.0|A new storyline continues in the unique world of Fables, as we focus on our main story at hand: that of Bigby and his family.  The great North Wind was the one to finally slay the seemingly indestructible Mr. Dark, but has paid the ultimate penalty in losing his life.  Now a successor must be chosen to take the throne, and Bigby has renounced all intentions of this, so it will be up to one of his and Snow's cubs to take the mantle.  The question is which one?  The parents get to watch as their children are subjected to a series of trials and tests by the North Wind's servants, while the East, West and South winds hungrily watch, looking to seize this power vacuum.    Meanwhile, things continue along in the rest of the world, as Rose Red continues cleaning up and making sure everything is right on the Farm; the monkey Bufkin continues his attack against the new ruler of the Pan Ozian Empire; and deep in the shadows of Castle Dark, Nurse Spratt prepares herself for revenge, awaiting her first victim.    Inherit the Wind continues a number of Fables storylines, keeping readers riveted as to what is happening with some of their favorite characters.  Along with some secondary storylines, it makes for another great collection of entertaining plot and beautiful artwork.    Originally written on October 24, 2012 ©Alex C. Telander.

1616960922|5.0|In another release from bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, The Emperor's Soul, he takes the concept of forgery to a whole new level, blending a world of magic and fantasy with something quite simple.    Shai was caught trying to replace the Moon Scepter with a forgery and now she's a prisoner.  Her ability is she can forge just about anything, whether a work of art, a vase, or even a wall.  The key is to make the forging stamps as detailed and perfect as possible, then the forged object will look exactly as it is supposed to.  Her most prized possessions are her soul stones that when stamped upon her will change the person she is to a warrior, merchant, or whoever she wants to be.  But her prisoners have a job for her freedom: Emperor Ashravan was almost killed by an assassin and has been left without consciousness.  Shai must forge a soul for him so he will once again be the emperor.    The Emperor's Soul is a great example of riveting story and enthralling fantasy, a perfect example of why Sanderson is one of our best fantasy writers writing today.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|its a great game! I love the new graphics and abilities as well as power ups. however I hate how you can only work to complete three objectives at a time plus there is not that many characters to choose from.
B00B2QA2F4|4.0|Like the old type Kung Fu movies. Very enjoyable I like the way Quentin does his movies.  A good cast. I did the HD version and saw a lot of pixelation.
B00B2EWNWG|1.0|I think I can sum up this movie this way: Hip-hop artist fancied himself to be a Samarai, has watched a bunch of Kung Fu movies, and thought he could make a movie. Spoiler alert: He couldn't.
1455502758|4.0|With the passing of popular author Christopher Hitchens on December 15, 2011, the world lost a powerful voice in the writing world.  It began for Hitchens on June 8, 2010 while on a book tour when he was brought down by extreme pain in his chest and throat.  It was then that he was diagnosed with cancer, and began a rigorous series of treatments and chemo therapy to try to get rid of the cancer and bring him on the road to recovery.    It was a long hard struggle, and while at points Hitchens' health did seem to improve, ultimately the cancer was too much for him.  Mortality is a collection of his writings and award-winning columns published in Vanity Fair.  They are his notes, thoughts and ideas, philosophies on life and his swiftly approaching mortality.  They are unavoidably moving when one considers who is writing down these words, akin to Randy Pausch's The Last Lecture.    Some might be looking to see if this staunch atheist turned to some divine deity as the days of his life grew short, but there is little in here of that; it is more the words of a man who knows he will soon die, and what that means to him, his wife, his family, his friends.  In the afterword, his wife recounts how he was always the one to have the last word, and now she is doing the job . . . and yet she admits, this isn't really true, as every time she picks up a book from their great library, in the margins and on the blank pages, she finds Hitchens' words everywhere.

B007SUW24W|5.0|\\"+\\" is just lovely! Ed is as fantastic as ever! The music and the lyrics for every song are pure perfection. I urge everyone to check out Ed's music and certainly to purchase this album!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thank you Mr. Howey, for writing this book and keeping me up for nights wanting to know what happens next. I finished this book smiling...content yet longing for more. I will be reading all of your stories that I can, I suggest anyone else with a passing  interest in entertaining and well written stories do the same. A review can not do enough to describe how enjoyable this book was. It's a bargain and one that should be on everyone's Kindle.
0312330855|5.0|Great book, it is one of those that people should read.  It gives great insight into the world of farmers and those who help take care of their animals.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game.  It is easy to manipulate and even has helpful hints if you get stuck.  Lots of fun.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I thought this game would be more interesting but it wasn't. It is more a child's game. It is ok for a little while.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book has a very cleverly thought out plot. Each time you think that perhaps you have figured it out, you turn the page to an unexpected twist in the story.I couldn't put it down!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|My daughter wanted this book after seeing the movie and loved it so much she finished it in a day. I liked it because It helped to open the door for discussion with my teenager about some of those awkward things like drugs and relationships.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game. Took a little bit from me figure out how to destroy the world but now that I have it is getting easier. Highly recommend this game for people who like strategy game.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I didn't enjoy playing this game on my Kindle Fire. I guess I played on a table at the bar to many times in my youth to enjoy playing it on my Kindle. Pac-Man will always be a fun game.
B00006JIA4|5.0|My son loved this and still owns to this day.  Great purchase .  Thanks for a great transactions.  He loved it then and now.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Such a fun version of an already fun game! Love the special abilities the birds have! So much fun to play!
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|My 10-year old son loves this game. It's a lot like &#34;Oregon Trail&#34; except here, you get to blow things up!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I would definitely recommend Pinterest. I love having it at my fingertips when I want to look at something. If you are interested in DIY, cooking etc. than this is the app for you.
B008M36EEI|4.0|This movie was a completely pleasant suprise and I have watched it 3 times. Almost a chick flick but with enough action to make it interesting for men too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is way better then temple run 1 like theirs stuff like a tunnel and ropes u swing from its so awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(:
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is such a good game! Instead of wasting time playing shooting games you can play MCPE which is productive and fun!
B00136JQMI|5.0|Miles' best from the 50's with an added track.  At a high bit-rate, better than vinyl. And a good price too.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Crashes on &quot;save me&quot; and all progress is lost along with whatever jems used. Frustrating. Can't play until the fix this. Also, sometimes the player just won't jump.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I love this app. It tells me exactly what i need to know.The percentage of battery life, how long I can have on certain things! I use this app alot! Extremely helpful!

B005HJU7HA|5.0|Aside from some issues with typos, this was a great compilation of Doyle's work.  It was fun to go over the Holmes/Watson meeting again and the early days of sleuthing.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My grandson loves this app.  It is very funny, I would recommend it.  It will definately make you laugh.  Cant beat the price $0.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is great it a lot of fun playing the game it gets better and better and hard to get far on the so it makes u keep playing and playing great game i love it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|What a pleasant surprise this book was. It exited me thrilled, made me mad all at the same time.<br />I just could not put it down until it was finished.
0553801473|2.0|Winter is coming? Really? That's what this (seemingly endless) cast of characters have been promising since the first book. I am half way through the fifth book and starting to have my doubts. Is it autumn yet?<br /><br />Just for the record I loved the first 3 books in this series which are, in my humble opinion the best fantasy trilogy since \\"Lord of the Rings\\". I therefore cannot explain what happened to the story line which apparently goes missing somewhere around book 4. Perhaps George Martin slipped in the shower and suffered a concussion shortly after completing \\"A Storm Of Swords\\"?<br /><br />I lost interest in \\"A Feast For Crows\\" about 1/2 way through and left it on a park bench. More like \\"Feast For Pigeons\\" if you ask me. Nevertheless I went out and purchased this turkey on faith.  Wake me when it's over. Zzzzzzzzzzzz....<br /><br />Before buying this book I highly recommend reading the Amazon customer review entitled \\"Twentyfour Characters in Search of a Story\\". It will tell you everything you need to know about this book thus saving you money, time and aggravation.<br /><br />\\"A Dance with Dragons\\" should come with a free bag of smelling salts attached to the inside dust jacket.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its the best game eva and  inever give any gmae a good review but this game is really awsome because killo games rule
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is definitely addicting... wasn't sure if I'd like it at first but quickly got hooked on it and it fun to take turns and switch out with my husband to see if he can keep up...
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The book was a short but sweet history, full of rich descriptions, and very clever writing, loyal to a Hard Science fiction genre. It was a pretty immersive experience and I couldn’t drop it for 2 days (read it all almost in one sit, and my shores went to hell :P). I recommend this book if you enjoy a mild humorous, well written story with action and lot of Hard SciFi theory.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This book was very engaging and informative. I loved how the stories intertwined nicely with the lessons. The different worksheet template things were amazing resources too!<br /><br />Def. would reccomend
B007PBKG5G|5.0|This is the best new music I have heard in a long time. Love the gritty, bluesy sound.  Buy it !
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book!! Must read this book the movie will be out soon. I am making all my friends read this book.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I like this game Ilike the scenes in the ocean.The people who designed the game did a qood job it makes it fun and I really enjoy hunting the object's
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|For anyone who likes playing Mahjong, this game is great!  I can stay entertained for hours.  There are so many different variations of the game.
B002APU580|3.0|This version is good, but I still prefer the BBC series from the 90's.  It's about 5 hours in length and just very well acted.  There were some good points to this movie, but it was a little too hollywood.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|Another excellent Rebus mystery from Ian Rankin.  Good story with many parts that come together in an unexpected conclusion.  If you liked the previous Rebus books you will like this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never written a review about a book before, probably because no other book has totally sucked me in the way this one has. Just kidding, Colleen Hoover's other books Slammed and Point of Retreat have, but I guess I was just to lazy to write about those. I absolutely loved this book. I swear this woman is a genius. Everything about her books is just so real. Sky and Holder had me completely hooked. I just stayed up until four in the morning reading this book so when you buy this book, make sure you have plenty of time to read it because you won't be able to put it down. I promise. I highly recommend Slammed and Point of Retreat because those will suck you in just as bad as Hopeless. Get ready to laugh, cry, laugh some more, and Then cry even more. But also get ready to experience the ride of your life. Hopeless will sure leave you utterly breathless but in most amazing way! Enjoy reading! I know I did...
B009XTF8KQ|1.0|A Dibbuk will suck the life out of you. This movie sucks for 90+ minutes of your time which you will never get back. That fact is the scariest part about the movie.
B0067R0APK|3.0|It ok it's not accurate it always 3-5 degrees of and no real feel temp. plus what do you expect from $.99 app.
0446691437|3.0|It just didn't speak to me that much.  I get that you need to be disciplined about art, but beyond that it was kind of a one note treatise that was oversimplified.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Even though Christmas is gone I still listen to this CD. Love every song on here, can't say that about any other CD I've ever purchased. Whitney was the best. She left us great music so we will know what it sounds like if we ever hear it again from these so called artists of today.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the best note app on the market. It syncs across multiple devices and really allows you to record everything from websites to outlines, to audio notes and photos. I do wish it allowed you to add wells to a pre-existing note.
0307352153|5.0|The power I discovered from reading this book isn't overt \\"power\\" in the traditional sense of the word. The \\"power\\" Susan Cain writes about is the power to understand human personalities and to value the differences. As a teacher, I found in \\"Quiet\\" the strategies I need to help advocate for students who are introverts. I can't count the student meetings I have attended where the child in question is negatively described as \\"so quiet.\\"  It is as if the child has a disability that needs remedied by becoming an extrovert! Teachers tell parents at Parent/Teacher Conferences that their child should not be so quiet! She/he should speak up more! Our culture values and admires extroverted personalities. But those of us who work in any area of teaching--whether it is preschool or college--need to remember the \\"power\\" we have to encourage and assist those quiet students who are very much in need of a healthy dose of self-confidence, self-esteem, and coping skills. Reading this book gave me the in-depth understanding of human personality that has changed my understanding of people.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Anyone who saw John Hawkes in &#34;Winter's Bone&#34; will be excited to see his portrayal of a polio-stricken man looking to round out his life before his inevitable death. I was amazed at his comic delivery.
B004EPYZUS|3.0|a lot of it makes no sense. I don't want to give too  much away, but characters have nifty gadgets, which are technically impossible (but it IS Mission IMPOSSIBLE, so ...) but then aren't wearing body armor into the potentially dangerous situation, or they take actions that turn out to be unnecessary. You don't think about the inconsistencies while you're watching it, but it leaves a bitter aftertaste that a little better writing/producing could have avoided. I think I had higher expectations due to JJ Abrams involvement.
B009TO99TG|5.0|I came to Coldplay very late in the game by purchasing Mylo Xyloto.  I really enjoyed that CD and when this set came along it was a perfect supplement to Mylo Xyloto.  It would make a great gift set for someone that enjoys great music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love that they are having a world tour ;they are in rio now  this game is so adicting fun game
0896762629|5.0|Janet Arnold and her books are so incredibly unique - there is nothing else like them out there to give you the real scoop on period construction of garments and accessories!  This is the 4th or 5th book I own of her's and each one is more amazing than the last!
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Contains most of the songs I was looking for without having to buy several albums.  Price was reasonable.  Happy with this choice.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is so exciting and wonderful! I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I am not finished reading it yet (I'm not a fast reader) but I can't put it down!  I highly recommend to any fiction, science fiction, or fantasy lovers.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this ducks because you cant get all the new things thatcare in minecraft 0.6.0 there is baby things and armour the new update. But not on the kindle...
B00A4FOWYQ|2.0|This is a concerted effort by Tegan and Sara to go mainstream. They started to veer off their indie pop beginnings but now seem<br />to abandon them completely.  It is not the first time an artist has done this.After they find out they still can not reach mainstram<br />status their next release will be a \\"back to the basics\\" in order to  get their base hard core fans(likeme) back.If you have never heard<br />any of their early stuff you may like this album. They were that good .Perhaps I was expecting too much.What a shame that they peaked way too early.<br />This is one play and file away CD .
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This movie keeps you guessing. I loved it! It is action packed and felt different than the other Batman movies.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Only one word to describe it, Awesome!! I think you can read the first one first but it doesn't matter. An awesome adventure book with a twist!
B002EHM58C|4.0|I love almost every single track on Meteora and it is probably Linkin Park's 2nd best work since their commercial debut with Hybrid Theory. I find every track to be good to listen to, but I can find maybe 3 of them I can skip without feeling like I missed out. Among the better songs are &#34;Lying From You&#34;, &#34;Faint&#34;, &#34;Breaking the Habit&#34;, &#34;Nobody's Listening&#34;, and &#34;Numb&#34;. not in any particular order except how they run on the album.
0684824906|5.0|Well researched and written.  It shows there is nothing new in politics and things were dirtier in Lincoln's day.  Read and study.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|My 12 year old son wanted to watch this movie so I previewed it to make sure it wasn't too edgy.  First,  I would like to say that this movie was, in my opinion, the worst movie I have ever had to sit through, with the exception of Town and Country.  A bear who smokes weed, does cocaine, simulates having sex, and jerking off,  cusses, and is downright offensive, but then suddenly is kind hearted and sensitive. How Seth MacFarlane could have had all these moments of potential comedy  but ended up with no humor, nothing  nada. Second, there was something wrong with watching a disney style film in this type of offensive genre. I couldn't help but think while watching this movie society is getting  desensitized to horridly bad comedy and jokes,  making us think its funny when its not. The dumbing down of America is complete - congratulations. I am a fan of raunchy well written movies like Hangover, Bridesmaids, Scary Movie but this movie didn't move me to one out loud giggle.  The story line was the cliché dumb boy with crapy job gets pretty, smart, rich girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back because he promises to change. LAME, LAME, LAME. I am so surprised because this movie had some great actors and actresses!  Needless to say my son wont be watching it with me, EVER.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app is pretty awesome but sometimes it freezes up and the kindle makes it hard to play!  But besides those two things it's AWESOMELY AWESOMENESS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|The very best book I have read about the holocaust. I enjoyed it much more than Night. It is amazing that Frankl could be objective about his suffering and that it helped him to deal with the trauma while he was in it. Optimism saved his llfe.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Good show.  Lots of depth to the characters.  Well written.  I was trying to be concise in this review, but they are making me write 10 more words!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I can't stop playing it is so much fun if you don't like it then I don't know what's wrong with you
0449014347|4.0|Having read and enjoyed The Maze Runner series, I had high hopes for this prequel to the series. My hopes were too high, apparently.<br /><br />Great things about the book, evident in all the Dashner books I've read so far: page-turning action and end-of-the-world tension. Nearly every chapter ends with a cliffhanger, and the characters are almost constantly running or fighting for their lives.<br /><br />But I think Dashner took his skill for writing thrillers a step too far with this book. The characters almost never caught a break or had time to sit down and relax their guard (unless passing out from exhaustion--and even then, nightmares haunted them). I felt myself wanting the book to end because I was just so worn out from the constant battle for existence.<br /><br />In addition, I can't figure out why Dashner included the prologue and the epilogue. Both were related to The Maze Runner series, but really had nothing to do with THE KILL ORDER. If someone read TKO without reading TMR first, my guess is that person would be very confused.<br /><br />I'm still giving this book four stars because it's a smartly written dystopian, a genre I like. If you love action-packed stories (especially, perhaps, if you're a male reluctant reader), you'll enjoy THE KILL ORDER. If you love stories which delve into character development and emotional exploration, this book might not be the one for you.<br /><br />Regarding the audiobook version: the narrator has an appealing voice with a wide range for the various characters. Occasionally a tad monotone in life-and-death situations, but overall the story was very well-read.
1932735410|5.0|I own my success on the PMP exam to Rita and Laurie. This book is simply the best material you can find out there. The chapters are aligned with the PMBOK and the questions at the end of the chapters are very similar to the exam.  In my case memorization didn't work; I relied on Rita's process chart which allowed me to understand the framework and therefore; use logic while answering the exam.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I use this one for class notes.  I really like this program.<br />I like the isea that Office programs can be used with this one
B007HACDLK|5.0|A non-stop thriller, filed with twist and turns!  I couldn't put IT Down.  This author could be the next James Patterson
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of Nicholas Sparks best novels! It keeps getting better and better till you can't put it down. Leaves you wanting more but also satisfied. Thanks Nicholas for another great read.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I read this book in just three hours.  It was so easy to read and the messages were so relevant to our lives that I could not put it down until it was finished.
0670026603|5.0|This is a book that will stay with you a long time. It is very well written and a very engaging story. Louisa Clark is a young women with no future and no job.  She lives with her parents, grandfather, sister and nephew in a tiny house in the shadow of the castle (a big tourist attraction) which dominates this small English village. In desperation, she takes a job as a companion to a young man, Will Traynor, who is a quadriplegic and trapped into a life he did not choose. This job is to last 6 months only.  These 6 months will transform Louisa and will be the catalyst for the rest of her life.  As one reads this book, you truly are transported into the lives of each character in the book. You also are privy to to the misery it must be to be a quadriplegic.  You will laugh, you will cry and be aware of the burgeoning love between Louisa and Will.  I really loved reading this book and look forward to reading more of Ms. Moyes books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm reading it for the second time before seeing the movie. I read it awhile ago but it is still fresh in my mind.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy is a wonderful collection to any book lover's collection. These books are filled with a great story line and interesting theme. Definitely a must read.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I was not disappointed. Grisham knows how to keep his stories flowing to the very end. Very informative. I enjoyed the twist in this story.
B004HD61KE|4.0|This Rollins novel was one of the better ones in the Sigma Force series.  The pace was very good and as always, the scientific detail was greatly researched.  Character developement was great and I loved the historical descriptions and information regarding the various Native American tribes and the Mormons.  Even when you separated the facts from the fiction, it was very educational.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Granddaughter and I are enjoying playing this game together.  Gives her an idea of how to care for a horse.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is an epic adventure that keeps you hooked right until the very end. I have never read so quickly, trying to devour as much as I could, reading all three books in 3 weeks. Suzanne Collins writes beautifully and allows your imagination to run wild. I couldn't fault the books!
0307408833|4.0|I purchased this book and the cookies, brownies and lemon poppyseed tea cake have turned out well, the frosting, however is a huge huge disappointment and the reason that I bought the book was to make the frosting.  something is very strange as when I watch the app the recipe is different, she uses coconut milk (does not say carton or canned) and the measurements are different than in the cookbook.  Huge disappointment, I have not tried any cake recipes as I am nervous to waste expensive ingredients since the frosting was such a disaster.  Soymilk powder, aggg it tastes like paste in the frosting.<br />Deborah
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an awesome game. You can created houses and other stuff from cube items. Very addictive and you can play with people in your own wifi. Wish they come out with an online multiplayer soon. Definetly worth the money.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was so exited when the sequel to temple run came out I had to get it! Temple run 2 is awesome you can ride ziplines  jump over waterfalls and even go into a cave and if you die you can use a diamonds to save yourself.

1401216676|5.0|This is a great story for Batman fans. You get to see just how demented the Joker is and the origin sequences really help shed light on why he is the way he is. Alan Moore's writing is top notch, there's a reason he's such a long career as a writer in the comics medium.<br /><br />The artwork is amazing. Brian Bolland gives a great amount of depth to the story. Also, this edition has Bolland's version of the coloring. Back in 1988 he wasn't given enough time to color it himself, but in this edition you can see just how he envisioned this tale. It's absolutely gorgeous. Most comics in recent years don't have artwork this nice.<br /><br />Forget this New 52 b.s. that DC has running. These older tales are what it's really about.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This season was even better than the first two seasons.<br /><br />Streaming from amazon was awesome too. It was easy and good quality.

B00B2V66VS|1.0|I loved Temple run.  so I was beside myself for this app! Opened after install and could tell quickly that Imangi had hit another home run.  Had some things to do so closed it...when try to play again...NOTHING. It would not open. I uninstalled and reinstalled...same dang thing. ive now tried four times.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I enjoyed the mystery and the different charecters. This is the first book I have read from this author. I look forward to going back and cataching up on Special Agent Pendergast. The writing is very detailed. I could picture clearly the homes where Pendergast lived as well as when he was just outwide of Tucson following his wife and when Pendergast went overseas to get his good son and take care of business.
1451629192|5.0|this book taught me a lot about how we are all kidnapped when we are dating others who take advantage of people. It isn't just JC it is other situations where a person is trapped into a relationship that can be harmful for your mind and soul. We live in a dangerous life because if we speak up we can be threaten.

B0095XPZBC|4.0|Season 2 was when TNG really started getting good, and has some of the best episodes of the series. Riker gets a beard, Polaski and Guinan join the crew, the characters all know their rows, new characters enemies such as The Borg are introduced. Fantastic season.<br /><br />As far as the Blu-Ray goes, I was quite disappointed visually in season 2. CBS did the restoration on season 1 themselves, but outsourced season 2, and the company that did the restoration really dropped the ball. It is the number one complaint that you will read in forums across the internet. It still looks better than it ever has, but the picture quality is really inconsistant from one shot to the next. Some scenes are VERY heavy grain, and look like they actually took wide-shots and tried to zoom in on the film elements. Other shots look like they had heavy use of Digital Noise Reduction used. The outcry from videophiles has been so vocal, I am surprised that CBS hasn't issued a disc-exchange like they did in season 1. All I can say is, I hope they don't screw up season 3 like they did with season 2.<br /><br />It is still the best the show has ever looked, a huge upgrade from SD, but man, someone needs to be fired over this. It is like the restoration was done by people who had little understanding of HD.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I find this game very addictive and fun there are 4 characters from the last. Graphics amazing compared to first. New obstacles such  as a minecart  and airline. Go ahead if you are still reading your wasting good time to'm play temple run2
B003R0LBVW|1.0|Jonathan Franzen is one of those writers that people know about by word of mouth. His breakthrough novel, The Corrections, is a book that you are likely to discover in the process of unwrapping a birthday present from your uncle and aunt in Connecticut, the kind of work that an overexcited friend from your graduate school days presses into your hand and says: \\"You have to read this. It blew my mind.\\"<br /><br />I don't mind admitting that I, too, caught the fever. I started reading The Corrections on a plane to Los Angeles at the beginning of 2011, and by the time I finished it I had already started formulating plans to get my own family together for Christmas for the first time in more than a decade. While I found Franzen's style unattractive and pretentious, there was something real and identifiable about his characters that won me over. The author's apparent cruelty I saw as a necessary detachment on Franzen's part, important to shading the moral grays that turned each of the Lamberts into well-rounded, believable characters. As a consequence, I also went back and read his first two novels, which were solid enough.<br /><br />It was with a sense of anticipation, then, that I began reading Freedom a few days ago. I was patient. I was hopeful. As I got deeper into the novel, however, there was no getting around the looming conclusion: Freedom was downright awful. By the time I reached the three-hundred page mark, just over halfway, finishing the book really did feel like a prison sentence. Dutifully, I served my time.<br /><br />So what can account for this spectacular failure? How can Franzen strike such a chord with The Corrections and then come across as so utterly tone-deaf in Freedom?<br /><br />Before recounting its shortcomings, I should first say what it is that I liked about Freedom. After all, I did not expect it to be an unmitigated disaster from the very beginning, and it certainly did not feel that it was going to be while reading the initial stages of the story. Other reviewers have complained that the central characters of Patty and Walter were too dull to carry the story, a view with which I heartily disagree. Although Patty's stilted \\"autobiography\\" (which Franzen, for no good reason, writes in a third-person voice that is indistinguishable from the rest of the narrative) is an incredibly clumsy approach for an established novelist, I found Franzen's depiction of their tepid romance and marriage, especially the little details of the ways in which they repeatedly hurt and betray each other, to be painfully real. This element of insight in Franzen's writing is what made The Corrections so successful, this feeling that while reading his novel you are also undergoing a painful but necessary session of emotional therapy.<br /><br />Apart from the Berglund's disintegrating marriage, however, there was little to admire about Freedom. What made the early pages of the novel interesting was Franzen's critique of the ways in which human beings delude themselves. Thus, for instance, we witness Patty being led astray by her drug-addicted, emotionally manipulative college friend Eliza, who preys on Patty's guilt and lack of esteem in order control the latter's life. Similar spirals of reactive (should I say \\"corrective\\"?) behavior are set up throughout, from Joey's reaction to his parents to Patty's desire for Richard.<br /><br />The novel thus provides the reader with a litany of self-destructive, guilt-ridden, passive characters - a lot like The Corrections, you might say, but here is the strange thing. Whereas Franzen, in the early stages of the novel, highlights the negative effects that flow from the weakness and endless self-pity that motivate his characters, by the second half of the novel he attempts to transform these same horrible qualities into virtues. Walter, in particular, is supposedly redeemed by the contention that his inherited negativity gives his life \\"meaning.\\" Despite the utter betrayal of his own ethical standards and his staggeringly grandiose sense of self-righteousness, Walter is excused, in the narrator's eyes, because he is a \\"nice man.\\" Even Walter's loser brother, Mitch, a worthless drunk who shirks all responsibility for his five children, is transformed into a Thoreau-like hero by the end, living peacefully by a lake and only working when he has to. It's a bizarre and bewildering moral u-turn that Franzen takes, down a path where I simply cannot follow him.<br /><br />My increasing disillusionment with the novel as I was reading it only served to highlight other technical flaws that I might otherwise have been willing to overlook. I have already mentioned my dislike for Franzen's style in his earlier works, but in Freedom this pretentiousness reaches a level that is simply unbearable. Franzen's frantic need to provide in-depth descriptions of inane, unnecessary details and endless name-dropping was too much. Consider, for instance, this ridiculous sentence from the novel's epilogue (by which point I was at the end of my patience) in which Franzen makes a horrible contrast between the artificiality of the social networking site Twitter to the authenticity of birds in nature:<br /><br />\\"There was plenty of tweeting on Twitter, but the chirping and fluttering world of nature, which Walter had invoked as if people were still supposed to care about it, was one anxiety too many.\\" (p.546)<br /><br />To make matters worse, there are numerous other occasions where Franzen not only constructs hopelessly unwieldy metaphors, but also proceeds to insult the reader's intelligence by explaining the symbolism: he makes a lazy parallel, for instance, between Jenna's manipulation of Joey and the dubious loyalty shown to him by his right-wing political connections (p.401); the comparison of Patty's split from Richard to America's withdrawal from Vietnam (p.510); and, worst of all, the analogy between Joey's grotesque search through his own feces for his wedding ring to his arms deal in South America, the difference being that \\"there was no gold ring hidden in this particular pile of s***\\" (p.441). No, indeed, there was not.<br /><br />When I started reading Freedom, I thought I had some idea, based on my reading of his earlier novels, of what Franzen was setting out to achieve. What is most disappointing about Freedom is not that it is a failure, but that it is a betrayal of the kind of unrelenting emotional honesty that I once thought I detected in Franzen's work. A great writer is one who invites you to resist them and wins you over anyway, which is what happened to me with The Corrections. Freedom, by contrast, seems like a miscalculated attempt to preach to a particular section of the choir, and surely Franzen, who early on in the novel takes Walter to task for being unattractive precisely because he is so passively agreeable, should have understood this same dynamic in his readers.ical standards and his staggeringly grandiose sense of self-righteousness, Walter is excused, in the narrator's eyes, because he is a \\"nice man.\\" Even Walter's loser brother, Mitch, a worthless drunk who shirks all responsibility for his five children, is transformed into a Thoreau-like hero by the end, living peacefully by a lake and only working when he has to.

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|And she has done it again!  Ms. Milan has become one of my auto-buy historical authors in the past year, but I'm always cautious that she might write a book I dislike or one that just isn't for me.  Well, The Duchess War definitely made me feel like a paranoid fangirl.  It had absolutely almost everything that I love about historical romance with a twist.<br /><br />One thing that I have come to expect from a Courtney Milan book is the unconventional characters who are well-developed and realistic without being boring since she is not afraid to provide readers with characters that may not be widely accepted (today and in the past) and seems to enjoy seeing how much she can push the envelope.  Almost all the characters in The Duchess War seemed to follow this pattern from the main couple (Robert and Minnie) to the side characters.<br /><br />Our hero is Robert Blaisdell, a young duke, who is more than what he first appears.  Because while Robert may seem like the fairly typical English lord, he is anything but.  I can't go too much into the truth about him without spoiling it for future readers, but it is fabulous to discover and very unique for that time period.  I love when authors take cliched archetypes and shows how twisted they can be with the right amount of development.<br /><br />Minnie, the heroine, is similar to Robert in that she is so much more than she appears which, in her case, is a shy wallflower.  I have read many romances with wallflowers as heroines and most of them have a reason for their place in society, but I don't think I have ever read a wallflower with as valid a reason to avoid society's attention that Minnie.  Her past is a little over-the-top, but I can really appreciate what Milan was doing with her character.<br /><br />As a couple, Robert and Minnie are very unorthodox.  I have seen reviews that comment on the fact that they don't seem to have much of a connection and that it is difficult to see why they feel the way they do about each other.  I can see where those reviewers are coming from, but, for me, that was the beauty of this love story.  At first glance, they shouldn't work as a couple, but each of them gets something from the other that they desperately need.  The romance is very slow-burning and Ms. Milan takes her time getting them together, but it is so worth it by the end and I really admire the writing skills it takes to make something like this happen.<br /><br />There is a pretty large cast in The Duchess War and I found there to be a nice balance between introducing some key secondary people and keeping the main storyline moving.  Ms. Milan takes time to develop her less than important characters and I think that helps make her books stand out.  For example, she spends a bit of time on Robert's mother who he feels abandoned him throughout his childhood.  What is great about her is that she is not just the neglectful mother.  The author obviously took the time to really think about this woman and what her marriage must have been like to cause such a negative relationship with her son.  She took what could have been a cliched villain-like character and made her sympathetic and worthy of a second chance.<br /><br />My personal favorites of the side characters though were the other Brothers Sinister: Robert's half-brother Oliver (a bastard whose mother and stepfather were the focus of The Governess Affair), Sebastian (a science-loving lord), and Violet (the sole female and a very uncoventional countess).  Each of them was given a proper introduction which made me excited to read their own stories especially Sebastian.<br /><br />And, finally, I have to mention the historical setting the Ms. Milan provides her readers.  The Brothers Sinister series takes place in Victorian England which is a time of great changes politically, economically, and socially.  What is great about this book is the use of the time period to provide background for the characters and give them a purpose.  Someof the issues brought up in The Duchess War are radical politics, organized labor, and Darwinism.  I will say that sometimes I think the story got a bit bogged down by all the historical context midway through, but it quickly picked up again.<br /><br />All in all, I found this to be another successful historical romance for Ms. Milan.  She is truly a talented writer who knows how to take her characters and give them so much life one would expect them to jump off the page.  Plus the development of the romances is done skillfully and realistically in a way that is rare in today's historicals.  I really recommend this book to other readers especially if they are willing to give the story the chance to slowly develop into something poignant and beautiful.of the issues brought up in The Duchess War are radical politics, organized labor, and Darwinism.

B007ZI06FE|5.0|Two of my favorite genres are historical romance and paranormal romance so when I find a book that combines them my anticipation went through the roof.  Thank goodness Bec McMaster's debut met every expectation that I had and beyond.  Almost everything about this book worked for me from the setting to the supernatural worldbuilding to the characters to the romance.<br /><br />The London Steampunk series takes place in an alternate version of England which is an intriguing mix of the supernatural and steampunk.  The upper levels of British society are made up of people who are inflicted with a disease that causes them to age slower and crave blood.  This has shaped the entire culture and economy of the country which causes quite a few issues that the characters<br /><br />The heroine of Kiss of Steel is Honoria who is a young lady trying to keep her small family together after her father's mysterious death.  Unfortunately, she is trying to do this while hiding from a malicious English lord who has put a bounty on her head and things are further complicated by the fact that her brother is showing signs of the virus that afflicts the lords and ladies.  Overall, I really enjoyed this character.  Her strength and the determination she had to keeping her brother and sister safe was very admirable and easy to relate to.  She did have some frustrating moments where I felt like her pride was a bit too much, but, thankfully, those incidents were balanced out with some really admirable moments.<br /><br />And then we come to Blade who is one of my favorite heroes in recent memory.  I loved everything about this guy from his name to his look to his backstory, etc.  Blade is the self-proclaimed leader of the Rookery, the most dangerous slum in London, and has developed his own little gang to protect his interests throughout the city.  He also has a mysterious past that explains why he has the same disease that all the aristocracy have and why he has such a vendetta against them.  Another aspect of Blade that I adored was the vulnerability that he showed whenever he interacted with Honoria which is very refreshing in romance.<br /><br />The romance between Honoria and Blade was almost perfect.  The physical attraction was immediate, and unwanted on Honoria's part, but things quickly escalated to a more emotional level.  It was very obvious to me as a reader how perfect these two were for each other.  Their circumstances were different yet their ultimate goals were the same and it was really great to see that especially with all the darker aspects of this paranormal world.<br /><br />There were quite a few plots to follow in this book.  Since it is the first in a series, there is the obligatory introduction to the world and the main players in it, but I never felt like I was being provided too much information at a time.  In addition to the romance, there was the business of keeping Honoria and her family away from the malicious lord who has been searching for them for years.  McMaster also sets up, what I believe to be, a continual storyline for the series with the creation of a possible cure for the blood-craving virus which is introduced through a murder mystery involving a vampire on the loose in the Rookery.<br /><br />Overall, I found this debut to be well-written and highly entertaining.  I became fully engrossed in the world and eagerly anticipate returning to it in the future.  There are many roads that Ms. McMaster can follow with this series and I am excited to see what she does with some of these great characters especially Will the werewolf and Honoria's younger sister Lena.Another aspect of Blade that I adored was the vulnerability that he showed whenever he interacted with Honoria which is very refreshing in romance.<br /><br />The romance between Honoria and Blade was almost perfect.

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|These are the best Dvds, I even have my 19 year old granddaughter hooked on Columbo.  A nice clean set of stories that will have you coming back over and over again. I watch an episode every night before I go to sleep.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I like the twists and turns. How the story went on. It's a great read. If you haven't already read it it's worth its money. How he shaped it and the characters.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are fun, not only for kids but adults as well. My friend's kid can play them better than I can. She's 7 :-) Good, clean, not too violent, fun!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|As with most Angry Birds this is a lot of fun. I do find it was somewhat easier than some of the other angry birds at least for the first few programs. Then it gets more complicatedI It is a time waster, but it is also lots of fun.
B00338QENI|5.0|We read this book as our book of the month for book club. Discovered much about medical treatment from the 60's for poor blacks and so,e history about Johns Hopkins.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|This app works good in my Kindle fire. I do not use it often but when I do it works just fine for what I am searcing for,
B00A80SHFM|5.0|We play the Les Miserables CD in the car when we know our trip will be as long as the CD!  It brings back the movie perfectly (thus the crying).  We saw Les Mis on Christmas Day, which was opening day.  The theater was packed early and we had to sit in the second row from the screen.  We never sit that close, but those were the last seats.  I think sitting so close actually made the experience far more intense. This was the first time I saw Les Mis.  I never had an interest in seeing it before.  I was trying to keep an open mind, but was expecting NOT to like it.  I had planned to nap through it.  Heavy history such as the French Revolution never moved me so I certainly was unprepared to love this movie.  People who had seen Les Mis as a play expressed that the movie was very good but not as good as the play.  They did agree, however, the music and singing in the movie were outstanding<br /><br />Everyone is correct.  Anne Hathaway and Huge Jackman have beautiful singing voices and they were perfect in their parts. I'm not so sure about Russell Crowe.  He didn't seem right for the part.  He played a nasty person which I think contributed to my less than glowing opinion of his performance.  The songs he sang also reflected that.  Most likely that was how &#34;they&#34; wanted him portrayed.  Recently, I was surprised to learn he has a band and sings.  Go figure!<br /><br />I know if I had heard the CD before I saw the movie, the CD would have been meaningless for me.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|The item shipped very fast and it was not overpriced. I had always wanted to own this movie and when i saw that it was finally out on Blu-ray, I jumped on it, thank you.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's a solid app. I've had no crashes or glitches on my hd. No complaints yet. I'd recommend this to my friends.
B003ELKNH2|4.0|Movie came on time. I purchased it for someone else, but I haven't heard any complaints about the DVD being scratched once it was opened.
B00ARN0XGG|1.0|PA 4 is a movie that continues the story, five years since the disappearance of Katie and Hunter, and a suburban family witness strange events in their neighborhood when a woman and a mysterious child move in.<br /><br />I for one don't understand this trend of making these low budget, oh I am not being filmed movies such as this. Please make it stop. I never understood what people saw in the first one, let alone 3 more. Boring, poor acting, low budget, remake over and over of the same story.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I click on the app, then it wont load and I never got to play don't get this!!!!! I don't reccomend this at all
