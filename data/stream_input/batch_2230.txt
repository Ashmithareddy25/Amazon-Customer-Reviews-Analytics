B00AFEXRME|3.0|The only good thing about this movie was that Denzel Washington was starring in it. It had a very disappointing ending.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It's fun but needs more time it has a lot more items then minecraft pe like the pressure plate&amp; wire/Redstone fuse
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This product allowed me to email the pdf. to my Kindle account address and saving me the trip of having to do this on a computer.  Now I can do all this from the Kindle.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Such a great read! I loved it and didnt want to put it down! Soo glad I got the chance to read it!
B0045INOCO|5.0|I purchased this for my daughters as they were reading &#34;Heart of Darkness&#34; which this movie is based on. This movie dramatizing why we should never get involved in long drawn out wars (Afghanistan) and provides some great lines like &#34;I love the smell of napalm in the morning.&#34; What an amazing cast!
0307887960|5.0|I just want to do this on my own. A lot of people go on line to talk about how they are doing, I'd rather do it on my own. So these books are just what I needed.
B00498TQV8|5.0|The gritty underbelly of meth addicts in rural Missouri is unfortunately a story hat could be written in many other parts of the U.S. Jennifer Lawrence is very convincing in her performance as the provider for her family. It is very interesting that her role in Hunger Games is very similar (no father, dysfunctional mother, younger sibling, etc). She is an amazing actor.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My favorite thing to do is sit on my front porch and look at all the Pinterest ideas from my Kindle Fire! I can repin and view my friends boards with no problem.
B003ZTQN1I|3.0|The cast does not sing all the songs on the cd, while the artists who sang on the cd are great, I wanted to hear the cast sing like in the movie.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It has all that I wanted in it. Every time I watch it I notice something new.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw this at the movies twice and purchased the DVD because I obviously was impressed by what i saw and heard.<br />I've read Victor Hugo's novel upon which this story is based, seen a couple of non-musical film versions, and have seen the musical staged twice, i expected to enjoy this film, but was genuinely surprised by how much i really loved this film.<br />To summarize it quickly, this film tells the story of Jean Valjean who is sent to prison for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's son. Valjean endures unbelievable hardship as a shackled prisoner as he sees his youth wasting away. When he is finally released from prison, he finds a prison in his freedom as public pariah who is never truly free as his activities are to be monitored and there is no way to improve his lot in life. He disappears and reinvents himself and through a series of circumstances becomes a wealthy man. While he enjoys his new life and tries to share his improved circumstances with others, he always feels the shadow of his former guard a public official type named Joubert. The ensuing story covers Valjean's attempts to evade Joubert who is seemingly always just one step away from capturing him and returning him to prison. As side stories, there is the romance of  Valjean's adopted daughter Cosette and the well born Marius, the French Revolution, and the ill-fated mother of Cosette named Fantine.<br />This movie was remarkable in a lot of ways. Musicals are normally not very popular as an art form when translated to film. I really don't have a good explanation for why there aren't more musicals made, but i suspect it has a lot to do with cost. In the case of this film, it was very expensively made. The sets were really exquisite and while there was a lot of computer wizardry present the effects were generally very realistic in appearance. The costuming was fantastic and varied from the lush gowns worn by women to the rags worn by Valjean and his fellow prisoners.<br />The story in itself was powerful and the music complimented the story as unfolded. The dialogue was sung as it was interspersed with large and small scale musical numbers which advanced the story along. The characters were well developed and I found myself becoming invested in their story almost immediately. The acting was really good and I found it interesting how the actors were able to use the music to enhance their roles. Even though i knew the story and where it was heading, I didn't find it boring or for that matter even paticularly predictable. I just sort of invested myself in this spectacle of sight and sound.<br />I bought the DVD not so much because I plan to watch it a lot, but because I just found this to be a really exceptional film that I will enjoy in the future.itself was powerful and the music complimented the story as unfolded.

B00979CS50|5.0|I believe Neil and the CH band are one of the finest garage bands ever!  Not too many folks have the kahunnas and energy to put out a double album that contains a 27 and a couple of 16 minute songs.  I, for one, love that aspect of Neil and these four friends of his....it's amazing where their music will take you...
B001HNE3NO|4.0|The twists and turns this book takes is a little hard to follow in places.  However, as it moves along, the plot comes to light and describes the horrible sufferings Hitler inflicted upon Jewish people, as well as some non-Jewish.  Their strength to continue forward and try to survive it amazing.  Making the choices Sarah was faced to make very difficult for her and you have to ask yourself if it was a good ending.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book I had to finish it in one night. I have read a few of his books and this one is my favorite.
B0067R0APK|4.0|First let me say that I do own this app and I have used the free app.  One , well the main reason I got the paid for version and so far find it better than the free one is that the free version was almost always having operating issues that so far seem to be solved in this version.  I am a college student and on class days during winter I need an accurate way to get the weather and this is it.  Only reason I have not given it five stars is that I have only had it a few days and yes like others have said it does not have more features than the free version but what it does have is pretty nice.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|Delirium was the start to a great series. In a world where love is not allowed I couldn't help but fall in love with this book. I think I liked Pandemonium (the 2nd book) better and I'm about to start Requiem and cant wait. If you like books that are different from your own world you'll like these books.
B003E6LC6I|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable, kept me guessing throughout the season.  Great acting, can't wait to see more of this series.  I wish more shows were this good
B000FBFML6|5.0|While a bit slower than its predecessor this is still well worth the time.  Fitz seems doomed to remain true to his vows despite everything he wants for himself.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|great and useful especially since I got it free.  It is the most reliable for viewing and making minor edits to documents.
0060989157|5.0|If you are a Crue fan this is a must read. Reader feels like the guys are talking to you like a old friend. I couldn't put it down. Thank you Nikki, Vince, Tommy and Mick for writing this.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Reading the first three reminded me of the first time I read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The imagery is fantastic and can't wait to read the next one.
1451696191|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I laughed and cried. You fall in love with the characters in this all consuming book. I wish it hadn't ended. I look forward to seeing how they adapted the book to the big screen.
B006CHML4I|5.0|How do they sell an automatic this cheap?<br />Seiko has a winner with this one. Light wearing and cool looking.
B004J4WLPU|3.0|The book started off slow for me but eventually the pace picked up and was exciting however the ending was a let down and needed more.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Even though you knew how it would end, we were holding our breath, so many close calls, everyone kept their cool and made the ending great
B007REV4T8|5.0|It's a fine movie had to purchase to put in the Bond 50 collection. six more words required are here
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Ive bought this game on android, pc and the wii and id buy it again on the xbox or ps3 if given the chance.  The game is fantastic.  It has good graphics, awesome  puzzles and the sound isnt bad either.  Check this game out.
B00004WEJZ|5.0|50 Collection but it's a Bond movie all the same to me.  Had to have it to go into my collection
1616550414|5.0|I havent finished reading it yet because I had to skip the whole part dedicated to Skyward Sword because im still working finishing the game.  That being said all the rest of the book is really good.  The only thing I would change is I would make it bigger and longer.  Im not complaining mind you Im just a huge fan of the series and have been since the 80s so more more more.<br /><br />The book is full of excellent info and great art work.  You really cant go wrong here.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|It's is a great product for the price.  Not too bulky, however depending on your cover, the kindle may not fit inside. My son has a slim gel cover, therefore the kindle fits inside.
B008RNGCAO|4.0|This book was pretty good.  I wanted the actual novel but since its no longer available for a decent price in print and not available at all on the kindle i decided to buy the graphic novel version.  Once I started reading I really couldnt stop.  The story is awesome, the art is good for its time and its just a fun and interesting read.  I wish they used this trilogy of books in Nolans Batman films, it would have been amazing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I heard about the show so wanted to checked it out too see what all the fuss was about.  Once I started I couldn't stop.  It has a way of getting your attention.  Even when I'm not watching it I find myself thinking about it.  What a great historical English series. Fun
B00A4Y9BT8|2.0|Everything else aside, this was an album that apparently set a standard for how good production could be. So why exactly would you remaster it? It appears that Vlado Meller, infamous for his over-compressed and clipped mastering of Red Hot Chili Peppers' \\"Californication,\\" remastered this album, and, judging by the waveforms, we now have a CD that's a victim of the loudness war... in 2012.<br /><br />Long story short, if you buy this album, don't buy it for the remaster, and, if you have an older version of the CD, hang on to it!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Leps World 2 was a pretty good game, I played it without having to spend any money. The only reason for four stars was that on one level it spawned Lep over a gap, so he fell and died. The game wouldn't allow  me to proceed in unlocking levels. Up until that level it was addictive and fun, had some ads that would lock the game up, but otherwise very fun. A fair game to download as a time waster. Have fun with it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is hot hot hot!!!!  Gideon is a man of many secrets and waiting for his past to unravel has me sitting on the edge of my seat.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Great book intense! Lots of drama and twists. You'll never see the ending coming at all. Great read some sex though.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Invictus is such a great movie.  It's so inspiring, and you don't see too many movies about rugby...or South Africa, or Nelson Mandela.  and any movie starring Morgan Freeman is worth having.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it needs more blocks . Like carts for the P.E I mean so you can move around and it needs to be where we can put water down and have music boxes oh and a lever to do stuff like on that wipe out video on YouTube see and get skins der
B003UESJHO|4.0|I started boxing when I got a personal trainer who happened to be a boxer, and I LOVED it!  So naturally, when he recommended boxing movies to me, I had to go get them.  Very good movie.  I love to watch the training and fight scenes; it makes me want to go work out.  There was a bit too much language in the movie for my taste, but other than that I enjoyed it very much.
B00BJZJXWG|5.0|This album is so good, very soothing and calm but at the same time it has such an upbeat and lively feeling to it. One of my personal favorites of the year so far!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I seem to be developing quite a collection of warm and fuzzy sports movies...but they are just so GOOD!  The Blind Side is no exception.  It's got such a great message, one that I think everybody needs to hear.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a excellent book it has power control sadness and happiness is the best series on 2013  love love it I wish there was a forth book ugh with the same character in it
B004LWZW4M|3.0|I love this movie SO MUCH, so I was excited to get it....but I was VERY disappointed to discover that this brand new movie was scratched when it came to me.  I tried repairing it but it didn't work.  So even though I'd love to make my fiance watch it with me (he's not that into movies), I haven't yet because I know I'll be disappointed because of the scratches.  I probably should have returned it.
B000O599WG|4.0|This is a great film and one of my favorites. That said I bought the two disc special edition because I wanted to hear the commentary. I'll admit I was disappointed. I have seen the film more than a dozen times and expected the commentary to include comments from someone as passionate about the folm as I. What we got was a very competent but not very passionate analysis of the film. Oh and they list John Carpenter as part of the commentary, but other than saying the movie is a favorite (a paragraph or two) he is suspiciously absent for the lions share of the film commentary. Overall the commentary added nothing and the single disc version of the film is a better value.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|So far, so good. I've only done 2 very easy puzzles so far. Maybe I will be tearing my hair out by the time I get to the more difficult ones. Like the way it plays, especially lighting up all the places you have a number already from one selected.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game except the ads are very annoying and sometimes causes kindle fire to freeze up.  The ads should be at the end of a competition not at the beginning.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|This is an awesome CD. Duffy tells it like it is with her inspiring melody and up beat songs. I recommend this CD to anyone -
B003H4I4JU|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. I enjoyed the first in the series, but the whole idea of the book is just uninteresting to me. I don't care if or why humans are speciest. It's just not an interesting topic for me. I know we are and I don't care. Also, I could care less about religion, Catholicism in particular. If we are ever advanced enough to travel the stars then it's unlikely we will be very religious since religion is just superstition. In order to travel the stars, we must have complete mastery of science and knowledge...this drives out superstition. Why do people believe in religion? It's actually quite simple...it's the same reason why children believe in Santa Claus: they are brain washed as gullible little children and we develop all of these nonsense rituals and institutions to reinforce the lie. The topic of religion made the book very boring for me. I also dislike reading stories about self-destructive characters...it's usually very contrived, and here it is no different. The writing style here is also a bit of a let down.
1401233066|2.0|I was a little disappointed with this story line. The final conflict could have been more. The entire storyline was just not up to par with previous story lines. I found my mind wandering while I was reading.
B0053O89RY|5.0|What can you say?  Modern Family, with Parks and Recreation a close second, is the most consistently funny, well written comedy currently on network television.
B0014EVO4M|4.0|I enjoy the sound track created by Eddie Vedder from the movie; it takes me back to the story and the emotion behind it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I was way behind  the rest of the country.and getting ready for season 3. I was glad to find these two seasons sold together, so I could catch up.
B001B6PBBK|3.0|It isn't a &#34;go out and see it now&#34; type of movie, but you could do worse. I like Brittany Murphy as an actress, unfortunate she is gone.
B0091REZMW|2.0|I love the game, but I keep getting a notice to download the &#34;bathroom graphics, or the &#34;pantry graphics&#34;, but I am not able to scroll to the button for the download!  Also, everytime I turn around I have a spirit I have to banish from a room, but since I can't download any graphics for the extra rooms (and the game won't let me into any room that I've not downloaded the graphics), I am stuck in oen room because I can't earn extra stuff to banish things!  I think I'd really like this game if I could play it!
B0012FHGCW|5.0|The story takes some time to get moving, but once you see it, it really is a great, and true, story. I really like the soundtrack also.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|am I the only one that's here for the gems? so hows your day been goin good good that's great
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|This is truly a solid release. These studio recordings span 1968 thru 1970,post THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE years in the studio. Jimi's playing is very fluid,tight,soulful and flat-out stanky throughout these recordings. His singing is also very impressive and full of soul and style. The sound quality is also exceptional as well. The mixing by the great Eddie Kramer on these tracks are also a plus. I also really dig the packaging, and photos on the cover and inside of this album, and there is also plenty of information on each of these studio tracks. This album will give the true Hendrix historian and fan an idea as to where he wanted to take his music in the future. The concept behind this brilliant release shows the legacy behind jimi's art,and playing style,which has always been rooted in the blues,soul,jazz and funk. For example,the outstanding track:\\"Easy Blues\\",is an excellent far-out groovin'acid jazz instrumental that the late great Miles Davis would have really appreciated (I would have loved to hear those cats jam together). There are also songs such as:\\"Let Me Love You\\" and \\"Mojo Man\\" by Lonnie Youngblood and Jimi's old homies from his early lean Harlem years \\"The Ghetto Fighters\\" that goes back to Jimi's early playing style as a R&B sideman with cats like Little Richard and The Isley Brothers. Of course,a Hendrix compilation would not be complete without great Blues,and Jimi along with the Band Gypsys get low-down and nasty on the tracks:\\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\" and \\"Bleeding Heart\\". But what makes this album so enjoyable for me are all of the funk tracks! This release is a great example along with other stellar albums such as:\\"Electric Ladyland\\",\\"Band Of Gypsys\\",\\"Live At The Fillmore East\\",\\"First Rays Of The New Rising Sun\\" and \\"South Saturn Delta\\" as to how important Hendrix's playing helped form the sound and development of FUNKY music as a true art form. That is why legendary acts and bands in the Funk music genre (Prince,Ernie Isley,Funkadelic,Bootsy Collins,Jesse Johnson,Miles Davis,The Red Hot Chili Peppers,Eddie Hazel,FISHBONE etc.),will always mention Hendrix as a major inspiration. As serious collector,fan,avid listener and historian of the Hendrix library,I would highly recommend this compilation of studio recordings to anyone that is into the:Funk/R&B/Blues/Hard Rock music genres. Don't listen to the haters that claim that these songs are not quality releases. They're all entitled to their opinions,however the fact remains that this still Jimi Hendrix doing what he always did best,and that's recording music! I am also comfortable with saying that most of these tracks are top shelf,and displays Jimi Hendrix along with other outstanding musicians (Buddy Miles,Billy Cox,Mitch Mitchell,Rocky Issac,Lonnie Youngblood,Larry Lee,Juma Sultan and Stephen Stills),at their top form.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|I love every song on this album - she just has a great infectious kind of voice - lots of great lyrics and melodies. Love it!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A true account of the Iraq war from a fellow veteran who is no doubt 1 of the biggest heroes of our generation. I'd recommend this book to any vet or to anyone who is curious what it was like to be on the front line in that war.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I love this woman's voice! She is such a rare talent - her songs touch a range of emotions. I love this album!
1451695195|2.0|I had high hopes for this book, as it was written by a physician. After a few chapters though, it became repetitive. He retells the same thing in almost the same words in chapter after chapter. All that is added is a few words about somebody else's perception of what was happening. Boring, disappointing. Would not recommend it at all.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Absolutely fabulous...some of the best music I've heard in recent years. Thought provoking, timely and beautiful.A must for any serious listener or collector.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is one of the best video games I've ever played, and by far the most fulfilling. You will go through an emotional experience playing this game. It is a bit short if you're used to spending months playing one game this wont come close. It is essentially the length of a movie, but you will want to play it again and again. All the included extras are great too. Flower is an adorable game you can also get wrapped up in. Really worth it.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Some of the best music I've heard in recent years. I love, love, love it.  A must have work of art.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Liked. This was a good game for hidden objects. Not a lot of story behind it though. Graphics are really good
B00942X8PY|5.0|I don't keep many games on my Kindle Fire, but I'm going to keep this one. Huebrix is relaxing, is addictive, it makes me think. The puzzles start out easy but they get hard. I've spent half an hour trying to solve one.<br /><br />We have a choice of Zen our puzzle mode. They are the same, except we are either trying to earn medals or reach Zen. Solve the puzzle by drawing a line for as many spaces as in the box. Fill in the grid without crossing any lines. It's a simple concept --easy to learn, easy to play . . . at first. It does get challenging!<br /><br />The music is soothing. I usually turn of sound, but I leave it on for this game. It's hard to put down once I get started. This is a fun way to exercise my brain. I'm loving it.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Extremely well written - very good story line and well executed.<br />[Extra words to meet minimal review requirements - crazy requirement!]
B008XBCJ34|5.0|sencillamente el mejor 3D que he visto!! recomendado para los que gustan calidad de imagen y sonido, aparte de ser una buena pelicula
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love this movie. If you are a Jane Austin fan, you, too, will enjoy this 8? 10? (I forget) hour adaption of the book.
B0015AARJI|5.0|is perfect. it is what i was looking for. i got it just in time so everything is fine. thanks
B009AOFNU4|5.0|I use this only for pc gaming, the steelseries engine ( [...] ) allows to create profiles for every game, simply mapping your game keys to each button you want on the steelseries gamepad.    Currently I play Sonic all stars racing and DMC, Its a great product for the PC !
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|We rented this movie over the weekend and overall, the family like it.  It was extremely difficult to find via Redbox, but we were persistent and finally were able to rent it.<br /><br />On Blu-ray, the picture is amazing.  The detail they have with these movies now, in particular animated movies is incredible.  In particular, the candy game world just about blew me away with the detail (the candy cars, Oreo's, Jellies).<br /><br />It was also nice to see some good old games get mentioned from the arcade perspective.  It brought back a lot of memories about my own time spent in many arcades growing up.<br /><br />To some degree, the movie did drag a little for us (hence 4 star).  In particular, near the end, you pretty much knew what was going to happen, but they milked it for another 15 minutes.<br /><br />A great rental, not sure I will buy.
B004RE29PO|5.0|I have the VHS of this and have just about worn it out.  I wanted the DVD format so I could enjoy it for years to come.
B000NQRE1E|4.0|For years, I watched Titanic as it came on TV and grew annoyed at its cheesy and predictable storyline.  In 2012, I took a chance on the film and went to see it in theaters.  While I'll have respect for the film's music, the film itself wasn't as impressive.  However, as I sat in the theater with my fiancee watching the film, a new-found sense of awe came over me.  I was able to see the film as it was meant to be seen, in theaters, and instead of being unimpressed as I had before, I enjoyed the movie and got an understanding for why so many enjoyed it.  I purchased it on Blu-Ray in hopes my awe would remain intact.  Indeed, it has.<br /><br />From the moment the disc starts, the high-def imagery and sound catches you and keeps you involved in the film that's been called &#34;a timeless classic&#34; to &#34;your typical romantic story&#34;.  While it doesn't capture everything I experienced in theaters, which most likely will never happen, the beauty of the colors and visual effects as the Titanic sinks and people die still caused me to pause and feel helpless.<br /><br />If you are a movie enthusiast, I highly recommend giving this version a shot and seeing if it changes your opinion of the film.  The extra features takes you into the world of making the highest grossing Best Picture winner and shows the many things they did in this pre-cheap CGI world.  If you walked out of the film humming the tunes, you have no excuse for passing this up.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I've been wanting to see the pre-quel to Alien for a long time.  Well worth the time to watch it...answered some of the questions around Alien.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|This is an interesting game.  You use gooballs and build complex structures to fill up a &#34;goo bar&#34;.  Physics play a major role in the game and can greatly influence your success or failure.  It's more than just a casual game because you have to concentrate on it, unlike &#34;Angry Birds&#34; or &#34;Where's My Water?&#34; where the winning choice can be immediately obvious.<br /><br />However, some of the levels can get repetitive and feel similar to previous ones you've beaten.  At other times, the levels can get very difficult and require a lot of time to accomplish.  The latter is not a complaint.  I tire of games that can be beaten just by looking at the screen for a few seconds and enjoy a nice, difficult game.  It is simply a warning to those looking for a time-wasting game to take their minds off of waiting for a table or doctor.  It is easy to get sucked into this game and forget where you are.<br /><br />Another warning:  You must be signed into the Amazon Store to access.  I play on a Nexus 7, which requires a wifi connection and it gets annoying when I can't play this because I'm not connected.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Greats book with amazing ending could have mad more about pests and mat issues future but I loved it kk
B000005RU2|3.0|Why, oh why do these people have to meddle with our time-honored masterpieces? First off, as usual the music merits all 5 stars, after all these years the musicianship still shines through like a bright star! But in the remastering process they had to go and remove the crowd noises which used to fade out on the original LP and merge the performances into one whole live piece. The music has hardly been touched and you can enjoy the performances to the fullest with state-of-the-art remastering quality. But if, like me, you grew up listening to this stuff, you're still gonna miss the snipped out crowd noises and the fade-outs that were so much a part of the whole \\"Made in Japan\\" live album. Don't dare touch a masterpiece! It's not the first time, but I hope we've seen the last of these presumably ingenious re-touchings on old masterworks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun, my horse-loving friends, is to be had with this app.<br /><br />Options, challenge, and the thrill of having an equine companion that can be taken with you just about anywhere.<br /><br />Awesome.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|As always, Downton Abbey season 3 was awesome.  Love receiving the UK version.  It is an awesome series.  Always leaves me hungry for the next series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but i think you should be able to choose how your character looks lik the shape of the head the hair color etc. I LOVE IT ITS ALOT OF FUN!!!!!
B008I34YYY|2.0|Ah yes, Ridley Scott's Prometheus! The people from the internet hated this movie, but I kind of sort of liked it. Whoops! This isn't Prometheus! This is Iron Sky directed by... I dunno, some foreigner I guess. Anyhow, like Prometheus, Iron Sky had an awesome trailer. It had some German rock music. Space Nazis. Hot babes. Foot soldiers. Sarah Palin. In my mind's eye I saw perhaps the best movie ever made. I saw Space Nazi foot soldiers drop in from space and an over the top, ultra cheesy, super violent (Quentin Tarantino style) land and air war would ensue. However, where Prometheus disappointed the internet people, Iron Sky disappointed me. What I got instead of my all out Space Nazi war was cheap shot jokes about America, racial issues, a weak air/space battle, and a predictable change-of-heart ending.<br /><br />The costumes were great. Renate Richter (played by Julia Dietze) looked fantastic in her Nazi uniforms. Say what you will about the Germans in WWII, but they had damn slick outfits and Renate looks great in them! And her acting is good to boot. The Space Nazi soldier costumes were so rad and this adds to my disappointment. Imagine a movie centered around the Space Nazi invasion of earth with these awesome dudes shooting and blowing stuff up. I'm not saying the movie should have been darker or more serious. No. I was expecting a B movie, just a different type of B movie.<br /><br />Instead of the moon Nazis the movie spends a lot of its time showing how incompetent and cruel the American government is. I'm American and there are plenty of movies that I love that criticize American culture and American government. Movies like: They Live, Planet of the Apes, and Go Go Super Pink Barbie's Adventure. Criticizing America is not the problem. It is that this movie does it so poorly and spends so much time on it to the point that it becomes overly preachy. They could have made the movie around the invasion and still have gotten in their jokes about America, even better I would argue as it would have opened up more opportunities to show America's fictional blow-every-thing-up attitude.<br /><br />*SPOILER* The final air/space confrontation was dismal at best. A few Nazi UFOs blow some stuff up, and then the main baddy Klaus Adler (Gotz Otto) awakens the mother ship, which doesn't do much before the space war ships of the various nations of earth take it out. There is no ground battle. There is no cool moon Nazi stuff. Just a big let down of a climax.<br /><br />In the end Renate sees the wrongness of her Nazi ways and decides to go with James Washington (Christopher Kirby), who is black, bringing to the table all the controversies still surrounding race relations. Uhg it seems like movies are always trying to make me feel some kind of guilt for the white man's racial fears and hatreds. I'm looking at you X-men: First Class. Why did you have to kill off Darwin so fast? Fifteen minutes into the movie and anyone with half a brain can call this ending. It isn't a bad ending really, I just feel like Renate drops her Nazi upbringing too fast. The Nazis are a hateful and despicable group, but it is apart of her identity even if she is a kind and loving person. But atlas it is just a movie and she had to go through some arc, the writers just had her go through the easiest one. This complaint is a bit of a nit-pick.<br /><br />Iron Sky was my Prometheus. I really see no reason to watch it a second time. The jokes were smirk-funny (a lower form of funny, lower than chuckle-funny) and there was no big ground war. What could have been!! Anyway, GO USA!!! I'm serious. America is awesome.tter I would argue as it would have opened up more opportunities to show America's fictional blow-every-thing-up attitude.<br /><br />*SPOILER* The final air/space confrontation was dismal at best.

B001S86J2Q|5.0|Grease is an amazing musical with just the right balance of drama. The storyline is classic and transcends time as the underlying message hits the core of every teenager.<br /><br />Danny Zuko puts his \\"tough boy\\" act behind him as he shares a wholesome summer romance with Australian, Sandy Olsen. When summer ends, the two believe they're going their separate ways until Sandy's parents decide to stay in America and she ends up in his high school.<br /><br />As the two share their summer romance stories with their friends we see that Danny has reverted back to his old ways as he sensationalizes the romance by turning it into something sleazy and slutty. And Sandy over dramatizes the romance by making it appear to be a love-affair right out of the movies. Then bam, the two meet!<br /><br />Sandy's excited to see Danny again and believes their summer romance can continue where it has left off, but Danny--unwilling to show a softer side to his fellow greasers--discounts the romance as nothing more than a summer fling and treats Sandy badly.<br /><br />Sandy, choosing to move on with her life, begins to date a more wholesome guy but her heart yearns for Danny. Danny, on the other hand, discovers that he cannot live without Sandy so he tries to break into her world while still trying to live in his own. In the end, it's Sandy who breaks into Danny's world and Danny who discovers that it's okay to show a softer side--for the right reasons.<br /><br />Aside from Danny and Sandy's romance story, there are sub-plots that manage to mingle beautifully with the main storyline--teenagers trying to find their places in the world, girls looking for the men of their dreams, boys trying to get to third base, gossiping, and even a pregnancy scare.<br /><br />There is, however, lots of raunchy sexual innuendos that probably wouldn't make the cut in today's PG-13 ratings so tread lighting with kids under 13--heck stick to kids 16 and above! In all honestly, this is not a wholesome family show but it is a family show. It's funny. It's lively. It's energetic. And it's a whole lot of fun.y show but it is a family show. It's funny. It's lively. It's energetic. And it's a whole lot of fun.

0385349947|5.0|The \\"Mommy Wars\\" have been raging since feminists embraced the old Virignia Slims ad line \\"You've Come A Long Way, Baby.\\" What mothers really know that is none of their choices are easy: Work full-time, stay at home, work part-time. No one has come up with the solution for a mother to \\"have it all.\\"  Sandberg, COO of Facebook, is no different.  In Lean In, she never says that she has THE answer.  She simply offers ideas - practical ideas for women, in any walk of life, quite frankly, who can take the very real behaviors that women have traditionally demonstrated (She uses empirical data here - it is fascinating) - and, if they wish, change their outcomes.<br /><br /> Sandberg's message is not an easy one to hear. And with any uncomfortable message, she is sure to get criticism.  There have already been accusations such as, \\"Ms Sandberg, you are an elite woman of means, other women can't do what you do...\\" Hogwash!  Sandberg specifically says that all women can not do what she does.  However, I suggest readers and potential readers stop clouding the issue with such nonsense and listen to her message.  And for the record, in the the US, every woman has at her disposal all the education she needs to become as successful as Sandberg...we all can not do it, obviously, but if we would all like to work as hard as she does, the options are there. I believe that is the message Sandberg is trying to share - to simply keep moving forward and not back away, see what could possibly happen.<br /><br />If you would like to get some background as to how women got where they are and some practical yet innovative, new ideas for how to be more successful in the future - heck, the strategies are terrific for any relationship - this is a book that may be useful.  For example, Sandberg points out that women traditionally are not so good at negotiating, this is a skill Sandberg learned as well.  I, for one, could use her advice on how to better negotiate, even in my small business.  There is a wealth of information here for women. Sandberg's overall message is a good one, too, namely, wouldn't it be nice of both woman and men, if they so desire, could have the ability to both contribute at home and at work?  This is not a new sentiment, Ann Crittenden had the same desires, as have millions of women between then and now, in her book The Price of Motherhood in 2001.  Please do not shoot the messenger and read the book, you just must learn something!is a wealth of information here for women.

B007US9NA8|5.0|For me, the casual person who works in an office 6 days a week, I wanted to know the most effective ways to get the most from my work out. I also wanted some solid nutritional advice. I think it is safe to say that Arnold has proven he knows what he is doing. While I have modified some of the things he says in the book, the other 90% I follow to the letter. It's great to have this available on my Kindle for iPhone because at a moments notice I can look up a lift and see the instructions on how to do it correctly. I would highly recommend this for anyone who is just looking to improve themselves or to compete for a Mr. Universe competition.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|I was entertained.  There was alot of action.  Stuff got blown up, there were lots of Navy vessels and the old drednaughts were exciting.  The storyline was a bit out of our world's reality but it was fiction so it could have happened to a parallel earth.

0316228532|4.0|I was so excited when I saw my all time favorite author had a new book out. Naturally, I rushed to read it.<br />I knew what it was supposed to be about, I knew it wasn't going to be a magical world filled with amazing characters.<br />I was just excited to see how J.K.'s writing style would play out into her new book. For the first part of the book I caught myself thinking 'Remember, this is NOT Harry Potter!' ... something I had a hard time remembering. Once I got past that, it was easier to focus on the story. While the book had some very interesting story lines, I really had a hard time getting into some of them. It seemed the book was very slow going (for someone who can read 500 pages in a couple hours, it took me 2 weeks to finish it...).<br />To be fair, this seems to be very spot on, when it comes to how every day people go on with their every day lives in a small town...<br />That being said, I really wish she'd put some of her plot twists and turns in it. She has magical foreshadowing techniques no one has ever seen before, and she didn't use them in this book.<br />The characters seemed pretty shallow and plain. While she brought various types of touchy subjects into her character's lives, their lives were barely skimmed over. She didn't go into much detail in their personalities, and I felt I was unable to *know* the characters.<br />All that aside, it was very well written and stays pretty true to the real life of any small town.<br />I love and respect J.K. and cannot wait to read any books she may release. I just hope she uses the amazing techniques she possesses for future projects.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I got this book because of the interviews I had heard about it.  I don't know what those people were basing their rating on - the story is predictable and not one of Sparks more interesting books.  I'm making myself finish it in the hopes that it gets better.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just love this show, though I didn't think I would like such a show. It's surprisingly deep for having so many zombies walking around. The zombies often provide comic relief in tough situations. I'm always surprised at how complex the characters' conundrums evolve to be. The biggest themes are who to trust and when, and who to help and when. Lately I love how the MiShawn character has developed from her introduction a while back when she had many scenes without talking at all.

1476719071|4.0|This book was a page turner. Different kind of story than i normally read. However, I liked it. At times I felt like it was a high school book. I would have liked it more if they had been older I think. A lot of teenage type drama. Over all a good read though!

0446547573|3.0|Clearly, Sparks is a master at manipulating emotion in the reader. He doesn't bring the rest of his writing up to that level, but lowers it down to the level of a Saturday morning cartoon for teenagers.<br />  Alex is perfect, far too perfect, and not a hint of a flaw. Then there is Kevin. Okay, he is an obsessive nut-ball, fine, but what motivates his villainy. He is a major character and we know nothing on that score. There is no significant backstory to explain why he is a lunatic-wife beater. Kevin is as flawed as Alex is perfect. That does not satisfy. Kevin is like the old-time mustache-twirling villain with a black hat. He is just pure wicked for no particular reason. One or two pages would have been plenty for the reason he is cracked.<br />  So why does Katie take it for so long from Kevin? She really has two different personalities that seem disconnected, and a little too convenient for the plot. Her backstory did not justify her allowing herself to be victimized to that extent.<br />  The bottom line is that Sparks is so good at building suspense, fights, chase scenes and tugging at the heart strings that he just phones in the rest. Here is a master writer delivering up melodrama. I felt insulted, by his effort.<br />  And, was the relentless repetition really necessary? Did he really have to repeat &#34;gray-haired man&#34; about twenty-five times? What about the fifteen times about the &#34;bad neighbors?&#34; How about the seventeen or so times &#34;the Bible says...&#34; maybe all the mind-numbing repetition replaced Kevin's backstory? It seemed lame to me.<br />  Sparks knows what he can get away with using his tricks to move the emotions, but he is letting a world-class talent wither terribly by producing this kind of cartoon. I think he is laughing a little at the reader too, and wondering why we take it.<br />  I’ve read Bel Canto by Ann Patchett, Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, and Heart of the Matter by Graham Greene lately, and Sparks has the ability to write at this level, but I suppose he is afraid to try. It’s a shame.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Very well written and constantly leaves with a feeling of \\"more\\". The characters have a seamless whit and humor. Thanks

B002PQ7JQK|4.0|Somewhat irregular image quality (I know, it's almost 50 years old, but there are moments one would think that they had two types of cameras in the studio, a standard 35mm and a Super 8...). Audio is OK, the menus are average, and the second season (at least) has those infuriating previews you have to sit or fast forward trough to get to the episodes themselves.<br /><br />That being said, there is not too much a bona fide trekkie like me can add: the new effects are less jarring than I thought they would be, and many of the episodes hold up surprisingly well even today - the writing was tighter, as the stories had to focus on the human element, instead of shoveling down special effects down the viewers throat on every single frame, as much of today's scifi seems to be about.<br /><br />Overall, a nice addition to my Star Trek shelf.<br />.
B00797MB0O|1.0|Not a good movie. Bland, boring and dull, this movie stops just before the character could reach a real cathartic moment

This novel gives a deeper look into the land we all fell in love with as kids. So much happened that the movie didn't include! It's an easy read (considering it was a children's series back in the day) and every page leaves you yearning for more. If you enjoy this, I would also recommend the other books in the Oz series. Have fun!

044024613X|3.0|Some of the reviews boast that the author is very John Gresham-like, but I didn't feel that way at all. The story was okay, but not exactly a mystery. The plot was slow and, at times frustratingly boring. The characters were complelling and there was just enough interest to pull the reader to completion of the tale. As a matter of fact, it was difficult to identify with Jacob at all, leave alone defend him.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read. Glad this isn't my life! Story is written from two different characters perspectives, which makes for a page-turner that's tough to put down.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I love this album!  It has a soulful rock feel to it and I absolutely love the lead singer.  She's so talented and gives the album a wonderful cutting edge.  The album is very warm and often sounds as if I am listening to a vinyl.  I would highly recommend this CD if you like soulful rock with a powerful female lead singer.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Funny, different, easy read. Unique characters and plot. Little slow at times, but had a &#34;feel good&#34; ending that keeps you interested until the end.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|At first I wasn't crazy about this album.  I would only play &#34;Some Nights&#34; and switch CD's.  Once I gave it a chance, I realized the craftsmanship of every song.  It is easily one of my favorite albums of 2013.  Every song is wonderful in its own way.  I would highly recommend this CD, with the disclaimer that the buyer not be hasty in judging it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome show! Love the progression of the character's. Drama at its best. One of those stories that sucks you in an keeps you spellbound.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I was hesitant to read this book. I had read about it last year and the negative reviews made me not want to waste my time. They all described the hero to be angry, a cheater, and a bad influence.<br />What book did they read? The hero was funny, passionate, and loving. Yeah he was jealous and had a temper, but the author never once made it seem to much to handle. And the cheating thing? I want to know where they read that cause from what I read, they weren't even together when he slept with someone else and the heroine was still acting like a brat. Personally until you find out more about Abby, I couldn't stand how superior she acted toward the hero. But once the story progressed I really enjoyed seeing her come into her own.<br /><br />Overall, this was a nice read. Great way to pass sometime!
0061537969|5.0|This book was a joy to read.  I  loved learning the story of this family through the voice of their dog.  The ending, without giving anything away....was brilliant.  I can't wait to give this book as a gift.

B00AA0TZTW|4.0|I'm partial and emotionally invested in the work of Jimi Hendrix and it's difficult to withhold my enthusiasm for People, Hell & Angels. What's more I prefer the Cox, Miles and Hendrix trio to The Experience, which this new issue mostly showcases; and yes there is that touch of that funk \\"thing\\" layering these mostly previously released numbers once found in different forms on defunct LPs, new canonical issuances, or bootlegs.<br /><br />I wonder for the new and curious listener just where might one turn to know which is \\"the version\\" the place to point one's ears for this or that track. The answer must be \\"decide for yourself\\".  That said I can without reservation recommend this work to those at least somewhat familiar with the Hendrix discography, yet for the new listener I wonder how he may fare not knowing the other Hendrix interpretations as background ? Perhaps it doesn't matter?<br /><br />From my perspective I enjoyed the other posthumous works \\"Baggy's,\\"  \\"Fillmore East\\" and the fertile jams of \\"Morning Symphony Ideas\\" and \\"Burning Desire\\" to this release. I sincerely think those works more completely achieve what People, Hell & Angels seeks. Though I'll dig through this CD for a long time and love it.<br /><br />This project will take some effort to get through, and that's ok. It was \\"totally far out\\" to hear Albert Allen croon Mojo Man, I thought I was listening to a Curtis Mayfield number.  There are other gems like this to be found on 2010's \\"West Coast Seattle Boy\\" like \\"Mastermind\\" and \\"Everlasting First\\",  tracks for which I was totally unprepared. For People, Hell & Angels there are a few tracks I may never warm up to and many others which I shall mostly enjoy comparing and contrasting with versions found elsewhere.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Stephen Kings has mastered the art of captivating a reader. I hope that people don't shy away from his books because he's known for being scary- He's only scary when he wants to be, and it's scary because he's so good! And then he's thrilling or funny or heartbreaking when he wants to be, like in this book.<br /><br />You will like to read this if you could appreciate a well researched view of the Kennedy assassination and the contemplation of the butterfly effect.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I usually don't go in for maudlin books.  And wouldn't have if the NY Times Book Review hadn't praised this so much.  The Times review was just right - while much sad occurs in Moyes' telling, it is masterfully crafted and in the last third truly pulls even at these hardened heart strings.  There is just enough good that comes from the ending that one doesn't feel despondent, but perhaps uplifted that lives are changed in positive ways from a negative situation.  This is often cliched, but not in Moyes' hands.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I thought this was an entertaining movie. If you liked the shrek movies then I believe you will like this movie as well, especially if you are a fan of the puss in boots character. I also thought the story this movie had was good and was not difficult to follow. I would recommend this movie to others.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Book was very well written. Loved that it was from both Chris and Taya points of view. Stories shared about others was also informative.
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|Not sure how historically accurate it is, but the story is interesting. We'll likely watch more to see how it does.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good game one of the best games i have on my game i think it should be rated 5 stars every time real good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book... U just have to read! It takes alot to cry and laugh in a book. This book made me do both. It's heart wrenching at times and for Me made me realize so much... In life in general. When u think ur life is so bad take a moment to realize how much worse it could b for other people. Maybe a neighbor u never met or even someone you know and quite possibly yourself  Read the book and the message behind it. One of my top favorites
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really great and keeps you occupied. Although this game is awesome it is quite addictive. So anyway you should buy this game.
B0036S4CTS|3.0|The concept of two people meeting each other and being together for a short period of time over many years intrigued me. The way these two characters grew and developed over the decades seemed to have them on divergent paths.
B007SGM084|5.0|I wanted to rekindle my old love of reading and recently received the new Kindle HD as a gift. I was looking for a good book to spark my inner-reader and I've heard such great things of this trilogy, that I decided this would be a great way to dive in. BOY WAS I RIGHT! I was infatuated from the beginning. These 3 books have set the bar high for my future novels. Breath taking til the very end.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I love this app it is so cool. I would recommend it to everyone.  Although on mine it won't save my pictures for some reason.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I do not watch any series but this one...the character development, the language, the situations seem a very real picture of life in the early 1900's...we look forward to each one, and because of the accents, we have viewed several again.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|If you are a fan of Tommy Emmanuel this DVD captures the essence of just how great he is.  Anyone who is a fan of great guitar and showmanship, this is for you.  I would challenge anyone to find a single note out of place !<br /><br />It`s a must have DVD.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie and the blue-ray disc was just amazing! I would certainly have this one recommended to other bond movie enthusiasts.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I went from not knowing about this show at all to being addicted in no time. I want to know who else is going to die. How are they going to end this show? Daryl surprised me he's totally awesome. I was like he looks familiar oh duh he was in Boondock Saints. I think they should end this show before they ruin it. Don't get me wrong I love it, but good shows have a tendency to go bad the longer they're on.
B001I5M9SC|2.0|This is one of Andrea's greatest performances, he had lots of world renowned guests thanks to the music contractors for allowing them to guest in this concert.<br /><br />However, I always notice a blue light lit on the panel of my blue ray player whenever a blue ray disc is played and I mean always  but this one did not so I was in doubt about the recording, was it really a blue ray or not? Another bad thing, the case was broken!
B003FSTN52|5.0|Have been waiting for all of the seasons to appear so that I could order them all at once. They did and I did also. Pkg. was perfect...
B004GYY714|5.0|I really enjoy this product.  I am well into learning Spanish and I can receive many Latin America stations.  Also the podcast are great.  Old music that can not be found anywhere on the radio dial.  It was called Radio - The First 100 year.  Fantastic!!!  All things considered was great also.  This product fits me well.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|Only saw a couple of episodes and new from the get-go that this would be a set I would want for the future...
1400063515|2.0|This book reads like one of those get-rich-quick self-help books that I hate so much.<br />It is full of &#34;I did this&#34; and &#34;I did that&#34;, including the false redemption and guilt following a meteoric rise to riches.<br />Mr. Taleb would like us to think that, in a way, he is a black swan.<br />If Mr. Taleb is attempting to present a cohesive and serious theory, he failed thoroughly and only succeeded at claiming ownership (perhaps falsely) of a catchy term.
B00884GR0W|1.0|Do not buy this app whatever people say! It wicks like a pice of crape! Once I opened this App it started making this wierd music. your probably saying &quot;music so&quot;well I turned it off and it was still playing music! THIS APP IT IS SOOOOOOO STUPID!
0812975219|4.0|I forced myself to read this book after reading Taleb's other book, The Black Swan.<br />This one had a lot less grandstanding and sounded a lot less arrogant than his other book. So the tone is much more readable.<br />As far as the content, it is actually quite objective and more grounded in theory.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|They said it was free and you can not get thru the first part before you are stopped and they demand money in order to keep playing.  All that these so called free games do is try and get you to keep spending you money. They are not upfront about the cost of playing. If it's just a preview of the game then that is how it should be advertised.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I have real calculator and this app on my phone....NeoCal blows Real Calculator out of the water. The user interface is a thing of beauty.
030758836X|1.0|This book sucked. Being that it was a on the NY Times Bestseller List on my Kindle Fire, I really had high expectations. However, the humor was extrememly vulgar at times, and the ending was one of the worst I have EVER read.  It was worse than a blatant cliffhanger.  There was no resolution, and I was looking for more pages to read. The book just ended suddenly.  I will not read another book by Gillian Flynn. Very disappointed.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Pollyanna is an endearing character who is determined to make a difference in her community.  She is successful and changes the lives of the townsfolk.  Read Pollyanna to your children to show them what you can achieve with a kind and loving heart.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I heard good things about this movie but they were ALL WRONG.  This movie is completely predictable and cliche.  It will end exactly how you think.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Interesting story with reasonable tense action.  Ben was not bad but was a little low key for the type of character.  All in all a good movie based on a story I never heard about until now.  I would recommend.
B001V7YJMG|4.0|These movies are sort of difficult to rate.  On one hand both tell a compelling story, are fairly well acted, and have satisfying conclusions.  On the other hand neither are really scary- at all.  The jump scares that are put in do not induce any fright and very little reaction.  So here is my problem.  Which trumps in this situation?  To help break this down I will examine each against each other, because I do feel that one is the superior movie.  I'll come out and say now that I prefer Let the Right One In, which is the original Swedish film.  The subject matter dealt with in both of these films is difficult for any actor, let alone children.  Both movies are well directed and reveal how the director was approaching the source material, which I will admit I am unfamiliar with.  Going by the films alone I think much of this is going to be personal preference in the end.  I'll begin with the tones of the films.  The Swedish version plays up the innocence in the main character, Oskar.  Throughout the film he has a real naiveté about him that never leaves, whereas Owen in the American version has much more anger.  This speaks to the sensibilities of the countries in which they were made.  In the States there are very few characters cut from Oskar's ilk anymore.  We want our protagonists strong and willing to fight, Oskar is not this.  Even in the scene where he does fight back, it is very subdued.  When the main antagonist begins bleeding from the ear I was genuinely shocked because it barely looked like he was hit.  I was expecting Oskar to hit him with the pole, have little effect, and still have the snot beat out of him.  It wasn't important how hard he hit, just that he did.  Owen, though, wants to cause pain.  He is angry and feels helpless and this fuels his rage.  It doesn't help that we feel less for the antagonist in the American version.  Neither versions have this character fleshed out, other than a brief mention of him being bullied in the home.  This backstory in itself bothers me because it is so cliche.<br />Another stark difference between the two characters comes when we are first introduced to them.  Oskar is seen in his room with a large knife acting out the famous 'You talkin' to me' scene from Taxi Driver.  We can see that this is the kind of guy he wants to be- someone who is strong and unafraid.  Owen has a similiar moment when we meet him.  He also has a large knife, but he is acting just like his bully, using the same words that are used on him.  He does not want to be someone who is strong and unafraid, but he wants to inflict his pain on others.  There is a real sense that if he were in the bullies position he would not hesitate to torture another person.  I think this makes him less sympathetic as a character.<br />The other important part of this film is the character of Eli/Abby.  Here it is harder to differentiate.  Both actresses play the character in a very similiar matter.  Both are terrible at being vampires in the sense that they do not have any subtlty or stealth in their attacks.  The Swedish version does not has quite as much on-screen with Eli in vampire form as the American version.  This again goes back to the sensiblities of the countries they were targeting.  Other than that both are done well, though I do still feel that the Swedish version comes out ahead.  The characters killed seem to have more reason to be killed rather than just being there at the time.<br /><br />Overall both of these moves are good.  If I had to rate them I would put Let Me In at 3 while Let the Right One In is 3.5.  Both tell good stories, but neither are really scary.  Worth watching if you like a good tale with some subtitles.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|An unusual story of a guy crippled by polio and his life struggles.  After you get over seeing Helen Hunt naked you can move on to the story and characters which are great.  Hawkes does and excellent job and you really believe his character is real.  I would recommend it as a good story about life and what is important.

B004Q3UL2O|2.0|This film is the utterly predictable retelling of a story that's been told a thousand times -- and much better. (If, for example, you want to see a story about a hot playboy being transformed by the genuine love of an unusual woman, watch the far superior Crazy Stupid Love). There is absolutely zero heat between the leads. It is a waste of Jake Gyllenhaal's talent and Anne Hathaway is her fairly annoying self. (Why IS she so annoying? I can't put my finger on it. It's almost as if she is always aware she is being watched).<br />The sex scenes, which were fairly explicit, were embarrassing for their lack of electricity -- they even made sex seem unappealing!<br />I'm not even sure why I gave it two stars, except that I really enjoyed the set design of her apartment and of course Oliver Platt. Who doesn't love Oliver Platt!??! AND Hank Azaria.... LOVE HIM TOO! AS I say, a waste of talent....
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Introduction<br />  There is little comment to make on such a famous tale.  Inevitably during the Christmas holiday season, the general public is inundated with a million and one different versions of Charles Dickens’ classic tale of redemption and hope- and we love every minute of it.  There is something innately human about the tale of Ebenezer Scrooge and the fact that Dickens wrote this quickly to pay some bills makes other writers tremble at his apparent genius.  The real question then comes down to this: how do the movies that are made ad infinitum match up to the original tale told by the master?<br /><br />Plot<br />  This is something that never really changes from film to film.  The main reason for that is that it is near perfect in its original form and to change it would almost amount to blasphemy.  The story is short and sweet: Scrooge is a crotchety old miser who hates the world until he realizes that it really is himself that he can’t stand.  His change of heart is always the endpoint of the movies, put it’s the journey that we as the public love.  I’ve seen my share of variations of this famous tale, and they all have their own merit.  Some, like the Muppet version, focus on the happier aspects and are musical in nature.  This is a great introduction to the tale and it hits all the highlights of the story while shying away from some of the more gritty bits.  Another well known version is that portrayed by Bill Murray, which manages to be probably the least charming of those with which I am familiar, yet even it has its good qualities.  Murray really makes you hate him in every way.  While this may be good for our initial view of Scrooge as a character, his transformation is the least convincing and is a bit forced.  However, the ghosts are great.  Buster Poindexter and Carol King do fantastic jobs as Past and Present, respectively.  My all time favorite is George C. Scott’s adaptation.  Of all the films, this is the closest to the novel, drawing a majority of its dialog directly from the text.  Though all of these adaptations draw from the same source material, it is rare that people ponder that material itself.  The book is, as mentioned, almost identical to most of the films, especially the Scott version.  The main difference lies in a few additional scenes where the ghosts, especially Present, take Scrooge to many more locations than those commonly referred to in the films, such as a lighthouse, a ship, and several other areas.  While these add a nice bit of flavor, they are hardly necessary and are rightly left out, in my opinion, from the films.<br /><br />Characters<br />  Scrooge is one of the most iconic literary and pop culture characters of all-time.  His name has become an adjective.  It’s almost impossible to say it without a hint of a grimace.  Yet, he is us, though exaggerated to an almost unrecognizable degree.  While Christmas can bring out the best in people, it can also bring out our worst: greed, envy, & impatience are but a few of the qualities that can be seen right next to kindness, charity, and understanding during the holidays.  It is this dichotomy that Scrooge represents.  In the book his transformation is rather quick and he seems like he genuinely feels remorse for his past actions after only the first ghost, whereas many of his film counterparts are a little slower to change their ways.  His redemption represents the goodness of mankind.  Yet, that change would not have been possible without the secondary characters in his life.  Foremost is that character of Marley and the 3 ghosts.  By the virtue of what they are, these characters are largely flat and devoid of much personality, and that is what makes them work for their purpose.  Marley is one of the few characters that is somewhat round and dynamic, though we do not get the change, only the story of his transformation.  The fact that the ghosts have little personality gives them an air of impartiality, which is necessary to help Scrooge see his errors.  If they were judgmental of Scrooge then it would open up the possibility to question their judgment, but as it is they have the air of omnipotence.  There is a bevy of other side characters, such as Bob Cratchit, Fred, and others, though they are not developed and do not play as important a role in the novel as they do in the films.<br /><br />Verdict<br />  Overall, this book is a worthy read during the holidays in-between viewings of various adaptations.  I always enjoy looking at source material for films, and this is no exception.  The tale is timeless and unforgettable and worth everyone’s time.  Whatever your choice of adaptation, they all basically follow the plot with some tweaks here and there, though nothing that would drastically alter the tale.  Check this book out.<br />5/5

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was so ready to read this book after having read the first one. This one I couldn't put down. Even if you are not into the S&M, which doesn't consume the whole book in my opinion you will get caught up in the love story and sub plots of the book.
1455502758|2.0|I think this book was published and recommended due to Hitchen's popular writing during his career.  Basically it's just a very short, disjointed collection of his feelings and actions after finding he had terminal cancer.  I was disappointed completely.  You can read it in about an hour, yet the price is equal to a regular book.  I can't even think of anything good to say about it, to be honest.<br /><br />Not recommended by me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a bittersweet read as I knew it was coming to an end. I wish there were more for this story. I am hoping she comes back with the story and we get to hear his voice like the teaser she gave us in the end. I can't wait to see the story come to life.

0307352153|5.0|Detailed description of introverts VS extroverts, as expected from an introvert herself. Can't stop turning the pages as soon as I started reading this book. A book to have for introverts to feel good about themselves in this &#34;extroverted&#34; world, and for the extroverts to accept and understand introverts and why we are so Quiet most of the time (though I don't expect an extrovert to sit down and actually read...haha). 5 stars for this book!

B0060MYM7O|5.0|Okay - so it's not as good as the books....but it's great in it's own right.  The story lines are close enough, although HBO did take some liberties as far as certain relationships are concerned.  Keep an open mind when watching - there is a lot of sex, violence, and just uncomfortable scenarios.  But those of us who've read the books know that the video series doesn't come anywhere close to the books!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game teaches the realities of caring for a horse without the sweat. its so cool!<br />try it and see. you will get hooked.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|We have enjoyed this Masterpiece Production from the beginning...and some of the endings of the previous Series have been less than satisfactory but this one is ridiculous....!!!! Now, how many months/years before it continues? Whatever...!!!<br />Just want the script writers to know that  we watch the 'romance and elegance' of a by-gone era to feel good...to have happy endings but, thus far Downton Abbey has been a lot of misery..Sybil with her marriage..Enid ...another ...and the ONLY romance and feel good relationship that there was...has been killed off! oh please! If we wanted to watch misery...watch the news and most of the movies in the cinemas.<br />I do believe that most folks who watch Downton...want to watch something beautiful and uplifting....of course with the usua limpediments..but do not kill off the main characters!! At present there is NO ONE who we are rooting for! SAD!!

All of my notes are in one easily accessible spot! And equally as awesome; saving images for quick reference. I love diy projects and am always finding inspiration online, in stores or magazines for cool furniture upcycle ideas etc. Now I can snap a pic of an item found in a store and save to evernote; or even save a pic from a website with the evernote webclipper app. Next time I need a little food for thought all my pica are in one spot. No matter where I am my notes, pics, videos, voice recordings and anything else I could possibly need are all in evernote. the sync option ensures I always have the most current of each no matter what device I have with me. Who knew an app could make life so much easier!
B002ZG981E|5.0|A great movie.  The plot is mind blowing.  I would tell you about it, but I can't.  In fact, I'm not even sure i'm awake right now.  I'm tripping.  Totally.  ...somebody help me.
B001E75QH0|4.0|I wanted this box set to add to my collection. I enjoy most of the Indiana Jones movies. It's fun to watch a young Harrison Ford.
B0055FR5PS|5.0|all i know about this is that there is a battle in LA.  the bad guys triumph triumphantly all over LA and stuff.  i am not sure about the whole &#34;plot&#34; thing, but there are definitely words in this here book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I think I liked this book even better than the first book in the Century Trilogy.  Ken Follett always keep me intrigued and I love his characters.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|have you seen this show? you should totally watch it.  once you've watched it, your life will improve 10 fold.
1423124111|5.0|If you are a true Disney fan and love Disney World and Disney Land...this book should be part of your collection.  Buy it
B009NQLT0M|3.0|The packaging and all the accessories that come with this fan are incredible but the fan is not as quiet as advertised, Ops! Sorry about that, sending them back.
0062082353|5.0|Got this for a step-grandson and he loves it! Great book by a great man, may he rest in peace and may God bless his family
B00A6SZS2Q|4.0|I love BVB and this is a really good CD but I like the last one a bit better.  BVB will not be disappointed, now we all have to go see the movie that is tied into this CD.
B00766CLPI|5.0|Had this on an eight track tape years ago and loved it then and love the remastered CD even more! An artist for the ages........have SO enjoyed this enormously talented women the bigger part of my life and this is a lush and beautiful selection of lovely music that could soothe away the most ragged day. Barbra's voice is in a class by itself. There won't be another Ella, another Judy, and there won't be another Barbra. Enjoy!
0307352153|5.0|Parts of the brain figure prominently in \\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,\\" by Susan Cain.<br /><br />Extensive functional MRIs reveal which parts of the brain are differently activated when introverts and extroverts react to questions or videos in scientific tests. Ms. Cain is not handing you something she has dreamed up, not some kind of pipe dream.<br /><br />The results she presents from many researchers clearly establish a physical basis for calling certain traits and behaviors introvert or extrovert. You really are different, she is saying. You are who you are, and you should take confidence in being just that. You are not a second class citizen, weirdo, or mentally ill person in need of treatment, or someone to be excluded from any part of society.<br /><br />The reading gets tough in some of her discussions, but the overall result is refreshing. Her amount of  research is astounding. Her presentation of the work of many scientists, and of her interviews with them, is first rate.<br /><br />Ms. Cain's index and notes are extensive. If your desire is to embrace the full scope of who you are as an introvert, I highly recommend this book. You can be assured, independent, and confident.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|This was a fantastic finish to a gripping six part series following Fitz. I read this second trilogy in about two weeks in the middle of tax season...just great.<br /><br />I would read them again, they're that good.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have always been a fan of John's work, I always have enjoyed watching him and his brother Hank create content on their YouTube channel. When I started to read Green's books, I was struck by the amount of emotional depth and meaning they held. Being a teenager myself, I felt that John Green really understood me (as cliche as that sounds). As I made my way through The Fault in Our Stars, I was blown away. Green's language, dark humor, and raw honesty created in me a love for this book which shall never cease. This book made me laugh, cry and everything in between. I have never before felt so attached to a book. Finishing the book wasn't easy, simply because I did not want to leave the universe that I had entered. I wanted to stay with the characters because they felt so life like. My outlook on life has been altered, and my perspective has been broadened. The Fault in Our Stars truly changed my life.
B006GLLREU|3.0|Season two has started off too slow for me of. So far season one is the best. I don't know if I will purchase the DVD collection or not.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I picked this rating because it was a good read - kept the pace moving all along the entire book but I thought the ending was a little abrupt and could have used a little more detail leading to the final book. I would recomend this to anyone who likes this type of reading - adventure, mystery and really want to know how they survive kind of along the lines of the Harry Potter books. Kept the interest up all the way through.
074356619X|5.0|well worth reading. it will help you be more successful and happy. very easy to read and use.<br />Also get the DVD
B007IK44CK|4.0|Better MI movie than the other crappy MI's.  A much better story line.  I was happily surprised.  It is worth a look
B0053O89RY|5.0|Awesome show...every show makes me laugh.  DVDs are in good shape.  I would recommend to anyone who needs a good laugh
0375869026|5.0|My 5th grade son's teacher gave him this book to read.  When he was done, he asked me to read it!  First time that ever happened so how could I say no.  Moving, thoughtful, sometimes hard to read story that I wish was mandatory reading for all kids.  My other two children have also agreed to read it!  Well done Ms. Palacio.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This was really fun!  Great idea, but there are not enough free songs.  It was more of a novelty than something I'll play all the time. I'll only bring it out during family events or parties.  It's fun to watch other people try it too.
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|I grew up listening to Led Zeppelin so I doubt I can be too impartial. The songs are great, Robert Plant's voice still sounds strong about the only negative thing I can come up with is that the production quality is a little rough.  I know it was live, in London at a large arena but I would have hoped that the sound would have been a little better.  It kind of sounds like you are listening from the middle of the crowd.  All in all if you are a Zeppelin fan you still have to love just listening to this great band live on more time.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|What more can you say about it. Just a great all around show that keeps getting better and better with time
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was good, and I really did enjoy it (already started the second one). There were a few things about the characters that bugged me, but no one is perfect. I have read a lot of NA books and it was up to par, the sex scenes were hot and good (a little repetative at times but still good), better than fifty shades but no where near as good as \\"Rush\\" (the breathless series), that by far is my favorite. Overall it was a good book and an easy read (finished it in a day or so). The characters I hope will grow a little more in the second novel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so ADDICTING  love it I would buy it if it was $5.00.But it's not so get it you'll love it
B00AHXDECG|5.0|love everything bruno mars does. he has it all going on. he has the perfect voice and beat to all his music
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great Album.<br />Not sure if I would like the genre.<br />They are coming to St Augustine in September.<br />They are a must see.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|gave this as a gift and it was loved. use to give bratz doll but this one was more up to date
B00818J504|5.0|This autobiography was worth the money! Lots of great pictures of her life and really brings you into her world from birth all the way to her songs on her name album, \\"Warrior\\". This is a must read..
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is so awesome! It helps with school and office work. I've been having trouble with math and this helps me a lot. What I don't  like is that when you touch the answer and the problem pops up, it doesn't show how to do the math problem. They should add that in an update, but it's a great-working app!!!
B004I744AS|5.0|This is definitely the best dictionary app for kindle. It has all of the things I would look for in a collegiate dictionary unlike dictionary.com.'s kindle app
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I want more!!!  It ended too soon for me.  I could not put this book down.  I am a sucker for books where someone is in a survival situation in isolation, especially when space travel is involved.  I want more from this author.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Many others have written lengthy and accurate views.  I'll not waste your time on more words.<br />I found this film spectacular.  A line I remember, \\"Your repeating yourself.\\"  The lead tenor, Gene Horton's love (Maggie Smith) responds, \\"In opera we're always repeating ourselves.\\"  The film is about a group of old people trying to recreate those golden moments of flow from their past lives.  Are we not all like that, or don't we all attempt it, but so few succeed.  This group at the retirement home actually pulls it off.  The quartet does put on a very respectable quartet from the end of Rigoletto - the most magnificent quartet music ever written.  The credits are astounding.  I stayed till the end.  All the actors are not actors;  they are retired musicians.  They play and sing all the music in the film.  Their images, from their prime, fill the right hand of the screen as the credits roll by:  la Scala, Covent Gardens, the Met, Frank Sinatra's orchestra, D'Oyly Carte and many others.  What a stunningly elegant touch;  it must be Hoffman's idea.<br />This film is a must see.
B000R4SMCW|1.0|Was unable to see entire movie as it froze and would not allow me to finish seeing the entire movie.  I liked the movie itself, but was unhappy to not be able to see all of it.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I am an avid fantasy reader.<br />This book swept me away.<br />Absolutely love the charecters and story. Went right to the top of my all time favorite list.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this revise...p.s. I cant belive that that male you right reviews for them....that stinks ...but I love Rh. Game.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The best book of the series. This is my second read of Storm and it was even better than the first turn with the book.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|Nice collection of there hits.Put in my CD player and listened to it all the way through. Great CD and would recomend it for 3 doors down fans.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|it is great but the time its just so short at least give us around 30 minutes plz we have no time to do anything.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|Well, I knew enough about cricket to follow what was happening from that aspect, but cricket was simply the back drop. Only an opinion... an adult read about young adults, not really erotica. Was initially a bit sceptical, then when I began to read it I couldn't put it down. This story all takes place in a single day. It is an exaggerated story about class differences. Gabriella is your upper class girl, who falls for Jim, the working class boy. There's sex, love and scandal to keep a reader hooked. The description of backdrop is realistic and the other characters in the book perfectly fit into the story. Many times I laughed out loud and was glad there was no one else around to ask me why. Enjoy!
1616550414|5.0|It's the freaking Hyrule Historia. Need I say more? It's beautiful and shows insights into the minds of the creators of the game. Very interesting.
0062238868|5.0|I probably wouldn't have read this book if it weren't for Chris Kyle's unfortunate death shortly after the book was published.  I've spent some time in the locations where he worked, and he gives a very accurate depiction of the environment of Iraq during the times he served.  Chris' style is down to earth, no nonsense and bluntly put.  In other words, it is a very accurate and honest book about the SEALS and the conflict in Iraq.  I highly recommend this book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is the only alarm app that wakes me up and im notorious for snoozing until im late!<br /><br />Best part is you can use your own music!
B007V65R54|3.0|The author seems a bit wrapped up with himself; I suppose a certain amount of arrogance is necessary to write a book like this.  He strays a bit too much for my taste into the politics behind the statistics - I'm not interested in his political views.  But he does a good job of relating several different areas (sports, politics, etc.) back to a similar approach and illustrates well that for most things we're not looking for a 90% chance our bet is right; all we need to see is a margin that tilts our way and most times, that's all we can hope for.  Point being that you can separate out the distracting information (the noise) that doesn't actually dictate the outcome and get a reasonable handle on forward outcomes.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is superb it has all elements of a great hidden picture game. Recommended for everyone who likes a good mystery.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I felt bad hoping she would fall for him disregarding that she was married. Not very ethical. But good book. Loved the ending.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My four year old grandson LOVES to play this on my Kindle.  I'm so glad I downloaded it for him!
1878424777|5.0|I would recommend this  book to every one that is trying to understand the  why of  living.<br />I read from this book almost daily.  It makes sense out of nonsense.<br />It helps  me not  label that which I dont know about or understanding<br /> Its awsome food for thought
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My grandson LOVES this game.  He's four years old and I was afraid he wouldn't know what to do and I sure didn't, but he picked it right up!
B002OG5GT8|5.0|I have a pillow speaker whose max volume is so low, it can only be heard through the thinnest of pillows. Added this to crank up the volume. And it works. I have to turn my player's volume down to about half. I'm not the best to judge the sound quality, since I'm listening from a pillow speaker through the pillow. But I mostly just listen to books on tape, etc., so I don't really care. I imagine this would be really good on an airplane. Being able to run/charge it with the USB port on my laptop is a real plus.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Excellent all around. Everything was as advertised and it was well worth the price. Would buy again as a gift.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Best movie i have seen in a long time, was on the edge of my seat til the very end of this movie.
B001OG3VOQ|5.0|Alanis Morissette is one of my all time favorites and this album is by far her best one. It's a must download!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have no idea how I came across this book.  I normally read classics or history....<br /><br />So it is that not often do I pick up a book for PURE ENJOYMENT !!!<br /><br />Not only is this book entertaining, it is smart, it is heart warming and holds life lessons.  AND it has real racing \\"stuff\\" racers and race tracks and racing tips...these are things I could discuss with my husband (and that was fun too).<br /><br />I did not know that Ferarri's first name was Enzo.  But now I will never forget it.<br /><br />This book cost almost nothing on Kindle....which is likely how I came across it....do it....bark twice for FASTER !<br />You will be thrilled that you did.<br /><br />****Spoiler ALERT****<br />When Enzo begs for a pepperocinni I know exactly what's coming - and I LOVE IT.
B002M9WW30|1.0|Had to return after watching Rocky III - the rest would not play.  Tried them in 3 different Blu-ray players and no luck - so had to return the entire set.  Firmware was not the problem - the Discs were.
B0044XUZ9K|1.0|i read the first page of this stupid book. i recomend not buying it. worst thing ever. boo you Robert Louis Stevenson.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I absolutely thought 11/22/63 was such a fun book.<br />Stephen King does it yet again.<br />This book has a lot of imagination and thought provoking.<br />Jake Epping is a complex and even romantic character, which I<br />found to be a little different then what you would expect from a King novel.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|The story is so romantic.  The characters are quite believable.  The cars and costumes are beautiful to see.  So are the stars of the show!!
B007REV4YI|3.0|This wasn't as great as the hype.  I would not pay $23 for this movie, but if you are a fan.... you may like it.
B0052CK5PQ|4.0|Thought this was a really interesting read.... For girls... Can't say I agree with everything she has to say but she is extremely interesting and funny
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I love this movie and was so glad it was closed captioned. Hope they make a 2 for it is a very good movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Everyone says this is a great trilogy and it is... First book is by far the best though... The second one was my least favourite.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|As expected, and the new DVD was perfect. I can't say enough about this series --- though I sometimes have trouble understanding the UK English and have to backtrack --- it's witty, engaging, and well acted. Who can't love Maggie Smith?
B007TK77QE|5.0|Don't know what I was expecting but it surpassed my expectations anyway. Enjoyable story, interesting and identifiable characters. Would recommend.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This was a really fun game I like the fact it mixes hidden objects and mystery.  The only thing I would change would be to make it longer.
034580404X|5.0|I have a read a few of the naughty books that many whom are into the genre enjoy.  You know, such as the Sleeping Beauty Chronicles and the like.  While yes, there are a few things about the characters that are pretty far fetched, this IS a FICTION book, and I couldn't put them down.  Well written, engaging, and not only sexy as hell, but witty as well.
B00AU15HPC|1.0|I wanted to like it I really did! This is totally dreary, song after song drifting along. The lyrics are stupifyingly banal. What a disappointment.
B007VWEEQQ|5.0|Works great for my A5 '12..if the song quality is crap then your SOUND quality will be crap as well with lots of static! Overall, kind of short for my reach because you have to change songs on your phone rather than using your buttons on the car/handle.<br /><br />Cons: Gotta get out of aux for phone calls.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|Story: 4 stars. Writing: 2.5 stars. Overall: a 3-star book. Look forward to the rest of the series. Lots of questions to be answered.
B008NW67E0|2.0|While a few of the songs are OK, the album as a whole is unremarkable.  It's amazing that these guys are adored, while bands of similar ilk have largely been ignored.  The Pogues, for instance, blow these guys away in the arena of lyrics, melody and musicianship.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|My 2 mo old daughter loves this toy, it hangs from her bassinet hood, instead of using the mobile it came with, it twirls around within grabbing reach, which she is working very hard at.
B000002KIT|5.0|Putting it simply - their best album and one of the best live albums ever.<br /><br />This is their best line-up covering their excellent back catalogue and bringing it up to date.<br /><br />A lot of bests in this review for a good reason - while the Black Rose tour was great, this album was the high point of their career<br /><br />Phil - you are sadly missed.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  I would recommend it to any one.  Much better than the sequel.
0812973992|5.0|Within the first few pages of starting this novel I knew that it was going to be good. It had the big three- characters, story, and writing.<br /><br />The Characters<br />- The way McCann connects his characters is both subtle and obvious at the same time. I always wonder about minor characters, what they back stories are, and how they became the way they are. This book provides that information, taking seemingly small characters from other points in the book and then making them the focus for a later chapter.<br />- The characters are so very damaged. Hookers, mothers of dead sons, a struggling religious zealot, to name a few. Through this struggle they bond and learn how to survive.<br /><br />The Story<br />- Everyone in this novel is connected, in some way, by a man who is walking on a tightrope between the Twin Towers, most of which have just seen him.<br />- There's no true whole plot, just a lot of stories- and that's okay. There doesn't need to be a beginning and an end.<br /><br />The Writing<br />- McCann has a way with words- they flow out perfectly for each character he's portraying. Everyone has a voice. Their spirits are captured in his writing.<br /><br />Just read it.
B007P6VM04|3.0|Some songs are missing.  Especially &#34;&#34;Howl&#34;  I love this one.<br />and Remember Me are just a few.  Could have had a more comprehensive album.
B00005TQKQ|3.0|The product is fine, but I thought it was over priced. Before 8mm camera's went away, ,ou could by the head cleaner for around $8.00.<br />Anyway, thanks for still carrying the product.
B00785P2QC|2.0|It's nearly impossible to earn enough credits to advance in the game.<br />The prices go way up and the earnings go way down the further the game advances.<br /><br />Hmmmm.....sounds like our economy too!
1616550414|4.0|Very nice to see all the games lined up like that, and detailed artwork. was cheap as well.<br />jjj kk
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I've never seen a movie quite like this one before, but I loved it! Laughed til tears ran down my face. Definitely NOT for children. So glad someone told me about &#34;PAUL&#34;.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|This was much better than the original movie. They punched up the story line and made it a little more believable. Great special effects.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I was hooked from the first episode!  wide perspective of how Brody coming home impacts everyone.  I love that you don't know if he's turned and they keep you hanging.  Good character development and acting is excellent!  At the end of each episode I was dying to see the next.  Did a marathon and watched it in 3 days and went on the hunt for Season 2!
B0098R6M1M|5.0|Recently, I coached my 10-year-old granddaughter, Emelia, on the value of doing a pro and con list when making decisions.  I gave her a template with two columns: five reasons for Plan A and five reasons for Plan B.  After a few minutes of fourth grade discernment, she presented her work:<br />--Plan A had five excellent reasons in favor.<br />--Plan B had just five words: None, None, None, None, None!<br /><br />I chuckled and thought, \\"Memo to Self: Read another book on coaching!\\"<br /><br />So with Plan A and Plan B fresh in my mind, I treated myself this weekend to a second viewing of this wonderful film, We Have a Pope (Habemus Papam).  My wife and I first enjoyed it at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2011 (Italian, with English sub-titles).<br /><br />If you view it this week (March 11-15, 2013), you get a twofer: 1) an entertaining film (1 hour and 45 minutes) with a tongue-in-check, inside-the-Sistine-Chapel look at the selection of a pope, and 2) comparisons to the real life conclave in Vatican City this week.<br /><br />No spoiler alert is needed because I'll just set the stage for you.  The papal conclave is in session--and balloting has begun.  The thunderous murmuring from dozens of cardinals needs no sub-titles: \\"Not me, Lord! Not me!\\" No one wants the job.<br /><br />Finally, a pope is selected--and that's when the fun and the soul-searching begin. The reluctant leader is not sure he wants to be pope. (Plan A or Plan B?) He is unprepared, he thinks, for this one-in-a-billion leadership challenge--and the cardinals (still locked in the Vatican, without cell phones) are not much help to their new leader. Yet he had their votes. Hmmm. Plan A or Plan B?<br /><br />It's a humorous, but eye-opening study in leadership trauma.  It's the perfect video to watch this week--as we watch Rome. Enjoy!<br /><br />By the way, I recently reviewed [[ASIN:1931018766 The Pope & The CEO: John Paul II's Leadership Lessons to a Young Swiss Guard]], by Andreas Widmer. It includes a memorable, heart-warming true story--perfect for your next staff meeting.s Widmer. It includes a memorable, heart-warming true story--perfect for your next staff meeting.
B003UESJEM|5.0|I was surprised and really enjoyed this movie.  I can relate to it having worked for a large corporation and feeling that everyone will be expendable at some point.  I think they did a nice job of showing the different perspectives at different levels....even from the brother-in-law. Some people said it was depressing in their reviews, but I think it was just very relatable to a lot of people...even if you aren't the top level of the corporate world. I enjoyed the actors and how they portrayed their characters.  Worth watching!
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|Studio rehearsal work is probably the best description of most of this compilation. There are numerous drubbed flat notes and missed hesitations that are corrected in the previous releases of the same material ... even though that material was remastered and dubbed in the 1970's. But it's OK as a final keepsake of my favorite guitarist. I am not sorry I bought it. I have bought much worse. However,the Hendrix estate (or whoever) should not set themselves up for outright embarrasment by trying to scratch together and release any more of this type of material unless it's found with Jimmy Hoffa.
B0007MAJBQ|4.0|It meets all of my specific needs at this time, for the projects I am working on.<br />Above all, price to product ratio is good.

0345803485|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Very unexpected in how it consumes your attention. Easy reading but watch out, it will grab you and not let you go.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|It seems like movies are becoming more reactionary and impulsive with very simple dialogue.  Skyfall is another example.  My theory is that the filmakers keep the dialogue simple to make translating the script to other languages simpler.

B009K0OL06|5.0|The story is line is constantly twisting to keep you suspended and constantly guessing. There is nothing predictable about this show.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Each episode leaves me wanting - no NEEDING - to see what happens next. With Amazon Prime I have had marathon SAMCRO watching days. Lots of totally unexpected happenings.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|what can you say about mark knoffler and dire straits, just a great double cd set well worth the money,which i thought after i got the set was cheap? if you buy this you will not be disapointed.
B009V3KKXY|4.0|I think this is an excellent book. this book has clear pictures and is easy to follow. hope you like it.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I started this series riveted, unable to put the books down, even after the author killed Eddard Stark. There were plots within plots that kept you on your toes, but this book should have tied together better than it did.  There were too many characters too loosely connected and the reader is left wondering to much.  What happened to King Stannis, Jaime, Jon........?????  I hope the next book, if there is one somehow can pull all of the characters together without killing all of them off.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. I play it every day. It's kinda like temple run in a way though. But this game needs a little bit more... like a little more action and adventure.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|Had to order this DVD for my husband.  We saw the movie and he absolutely loved it.  Bought it as a gift so he would always have it to watch.  Justin Timberlake is such a good actor.  Love him!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Annie<br /><br />Just finished reading this book . Thought it was the most wonderful story  I ever read. I could not put it down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read The Mocking Jay.<br />I love reading but their are very few author's that keep my attention. Also keep me yearning for more to read. Most of all I love how detailed and descriptive she is. It's like your there and watching it all. She a wonderful author, one of my top three favorite in fact.<br />Selena
B002VHI8J0|4.0|This one came highly recommended by my wife, various friends and a raft of critics. I found it difficult to get into, bewildering in its structure, beautifully written, wonderfully characterised and riveting once I made the initial effort to persevere.
B008VBYN80|4.0|its fun to play!! you can add you friends and play with them. only downside is spending gems on quests.
B007CI81IQ|4.0|This text is well written, contains tons of excellent info on world poverty and continually encourages one to read on into the text.  I am reading it as part of the MIT edX on-line course and find it much easier to follow than Professor Duflo's lectures as I have trouble understanding her.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I didn't know if I wanted to see this movie at first, but I'm glad I did. It was a great drama and a motivational movie. The fight scenes were really cool and well done.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Unfortunately, the story line was not particularly compelling.  Worse yet, none of the characters were likable people -- all rather irritating and single dimensional.  None of the adults characters garnered my sympathy.  The adolescent characters were somewhat more likable, but not enough so to make the book a good read.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|As much as I loved Series 3 and 4, and I do think series 4 was the best, at the same times they were a bit of a chore to watch. I mean, they did get progressively darker and uglier and at times downright depressing. But they had some extraordinary episodes. I'll never forget being held by the neck by the suspense of Midnight or scared to walk down the hallway of my house at night after watching &#34;Blink&#34;. Sadly, the specials (or the &#34;Let's get another year out of Tennant and Davies whether they like it or not&#34; episodes) were garbage. Aside from &#34;Waters of Mars&#34;, the Doctor did nothing but bitch and moan and whine, and I was glad to see him go. But I won't lie, his final scene was a bit heart wrenching, because the Doctor I knew and loved, despite being annoyed by his whininess in those last episodes, was leaving. But, when Matt Smith appeared for the first time in that last episode, my kind changed about him completely. I thought he was not going to live up, because DT set standards way too high. And maybe he did. But I was charmed by his suaveness, hilarity and perkiness within that short appearance, and immediately I sprung to &#34;The Eleventh Hour&#34; without hesitation.<br /><br />Simply put, Matt Smith is a winner. Sure, he's no David Tennant. But he doesn't try to be David Tmennat either- after all, if he tried aping the winning formula, it wouldn't be good, right? It would be sour and boring. Thankfully, Matt Smith does take a page or two from other actors books, but gives it his own spin too. He portrays The Doctor as someone who is almost always positive and thinks &#34;it can get much worse&#34;. Sure he does have a few moments where you can tell he's seen death, but he chooses not to angst and realizes that Time Lords have long lives for a reason. His catch phrases like &#34;Bow ties are cool&#34; and &#34;Geronimo!!!!!!&#34; are pure winners and are absolutely hilarious. And when he smiles, we smile. He is fun, charming, suave, persuasive, and flamboyant, which is truly refreshing.<br /><br />His companions are equally fun. Amelia Pond is a beautiful and fun girl who has a great sense of humour and doesn't take herself too seriously. She has a cute Scottish accent and a lot of hilarious one liners, and she helps make the episodes fun to watch. Her fiance&eacute; Rory is played by the handsome and charming Arthur Darvill, who does have to put up with Amy's constant sarcasm and sort of let's her walk all over him, but it's funny. He himself has some funny lines, like near the end of &#34;Vampires of Venice&#34;, when he uses the following to defend Amy: &#34;This way you ugly... spongebob... the only thing uglier was your-- mum...&#34;.<br /><br />The episodes? Admittedly this season does start rather slowly, but around episode 3, it really gets going, and when it does, it's a roller coaster. River Song returns for a couple episodes (including the Pandorica ones) and she is great to watch- sassy, full of class, and badass, with a lot of good jokes too. The weeping angels are back and this time they're everywhere. They're just as scary as they were in series 3 too. Really, I didn't not like any episodes in the season, as all of them were fun, and most were very fast paced.<br /><br />In short, I can't recommend this season enough. It's one of the best and the beginning of a era for The Doctor. Thank you Moffat for bringing new life to the show, and thanks to Smith for giving a fresh feel to The Doctor. Thanks to Gillan and Darvill for also providing excellent performances as the companions! And furthermore thanks to the Beeb for keeping Doctor Who alive!<br /><br />Now excuse me while I put my bow tie and fez on and cook up some nice hot fish sticks and custard too!rsuasive, and flamboyant, which is truly refreshing.<br /><br />His companions are equally fun.

B007TXN4TK|5.0|From the first time I played it, I enjoyed this app tremendously, and I think I've become addicted.  I know I've become determined to master it. I'll definitely buy the full version as soon as I can successfully play most of the songs here at least at the B level!!  For me, this app deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />This GAME would have a much better overall rating if only the reviews here were better.  The most useful reviews can actually be found for the APP called \\"Piano Master Christmas Special\\"(1level higher than this one).  BEFORE YOU CHOOSE THIS APP (PIANO MASTER FREE), PLEASE READ THE MOST USEFUL REVIEWS FOR THE PIANO MASTER CHRISTMAS SPECIAL APP!).  These reviews explain why this app is called a \\"game\\", how to enjoy this app, and one even addresses the most common complaint about this app AND HOW TO FIX IT (the no sound/freeze issue many reviewers mention here).<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon has a rule against over-quoting or I just would have quoted the most relevant parts of these 3 reviews (found on the reviews of the Piano Master Christmas Special) here.  See most helpful review 1 (It's Not Piano Lessons, It's A Game About Timing and Anticipation); most helpful review 2, and most helpful 3 (Has It's Pros and Cons). You'll be so glad you did!<br /><br />Addition after two more weeks:  I wish that the developers of this app would create sequential apps based on levels of difficulty.  It is taking me a great deal of practice to be able to play the songs marked as NORMAL at any but the Beginners and Apprentice levels; I've yet to get a grade higher than a C at the Expert level.  When I bought the Xmas app that's part of this program, I found very, very few Easy songs.  I'd buy an app today if it had ONLY Easy level songs.  Then I'd buy another that had ONLY songs of Normal difficulty, etc.  I really like this app, but playing chords on  Kindle is very, very difficult for my awkward fingers (I can actually play simple chords on a piano), but I'd love the opportunity for more time and practice.
0062238310|5.0|Just love the series - and the price was right to indulge a bit further.  Author includes lots of notes about what was kept from the script and cut out - it is a gem, and I get to relive the characters through a different medium in the off season.  Will be picking up the others...
B00005N6KG|3.0|Sony Ultra Lightweight Vertical In-The-Ear Headphones are uncomfortable in my ears and will not stay in position on my head so that the sound is unbalanced. Oddly enough, when I lay down with them on, they work very well.  That said, I am a very restful sleeper and move very little during my night.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this one. Again you get caught up in their lives and cannot wait to view the next episode. Looking forward to 3
0061906220|5.0|Pete the Cat Books are fabulous!  I have a Daycare and ALL the kids, from the babies all the way up to school age kids LOVE them!  They are fun and educational.  I highly recommend them!
B0091THRCU|4.0|I saw this for sale for about $10 and thought it was a fantastic deal. It's good quality leather and is great for carrying the phone around. The tab for pulling the phone works perfectly.
B008Q08T54|5.0|Want to see what drones can do??? WATCH THIS MOVIE!  I found this movie to be very thought provoking. Since we see what Drones can do...what do we have in the wings waiting to be 'tried'.  The &#34;WAR on TERROR&#34; is just beginning...and no sacrifice is too great...or is it. YOU decide.<br />P.S.  As usual George C. was fantastic.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is wonderful to be able to watch programs that are  good and entertaining without sex and violence! Keep it up!
B000PY6BBI|5.0|Mathew, Michelle, Rutger...fantastic secondary cast makes this movie a gem. Watch it and see what excellent movie making is all about! Well written, directed, musically scripted, and editing. Everything done to perfection transports you to another place...and you believe you're there!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful to be able to watch programs that are good and entertaining without sex and violence!  Just wish could get for free on Amazon Prime.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|The movie starts out with vulgar language and people sucking up cocaine off a table. I threw it in the trash. A real waste of my hard earned money. They should be showing all the drug use in the commercials.
B0086HGW42|5.0|He is bold and talented! He has a range of different styles on this album. &#34;Give me love&#34; is the best! I listen to it everyday. I believe it speaks to us on so many levels. I have been quite irritated lately. It is hard to find a great and talented artist. Many singers are just okay, but Ed Sheeran is among the best! Give him a chance. You will love him.
B00280LYIC|5.0|An weird book that you would like to read. I have really enjoyed a lot. Way to go Rick Riordan!¡!¡!¡!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Took a while for the action to start. DeMille likes to build the suspense, but not much building suspense as drudgery of spies and army personnel. Mostly waiting around for something to happen. Of course, John Corey wise ass lines are priceless.
B002361MLA|4.0|This book was reccommended to me as a good information source for life skills/guidance.  I have found it easy to read with some very good advice on how to live my life without stress. I would reccommend it to anyone seeking to improve their quality of life and living.
1609611543|5.0|great book, I am recommending it to everyone.  Well written, filled with historical facts to back up information presented.  Thanks
B001MM28JG|5.0|I love this movie.<br />This is a very funny movie that the whole family can enjoy. I can never get tired of GQ
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Just a great feel good movie.  Saw it in the theater and just had to have it when it came out on DVD.  Viewed for my 12-year old daughter and at the end she said, &#34;I am just SO happy right now!&#34;  That should give you some insight as to how wonderful this movie is.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I bought this mouse on impulse after a friend gave rave reviews of it. I switched from a Logitech M510, similar in size and shape but it pales in comparison. The feel of this mouse is perfect for palm users, very comfortable, ergonomically sound and feels solid. The build quality seems to be  very good. I generally play MMOs and the occasion FPS but I bought this mouse for League of Legends specifically. It's done the job well. The software very easy to use and pretty intuitive, and is much better than Logitech's G-Series program. The buttons are all very responsive and there is some nice tactile feedback as well. The side buttons could have been laid out a bit better for my liking, but they are by no means awkwardly placed. The lighting is nice, although customizing the other lights would have been cool, that's a good problem to have with a mouse. The weights give it a bit of extra heft, but it could stand to be a bit heavier, although that could be because I came from a wireless mouse with batteries. Overall, this mouse is comparable to any high end gaming mouse like a Steel Series or Razer, for a fraction of the price.
B000Q66HBE|5.0|This is my favorite band. If you like Slipknot, Limp Bizkit, Korn, Metallica, etc this band is for you. The limited is a little better than the regular, definitely worth a couple bucks extra.
B003KGBIRU|5.0|Wes Anderson is a genius. This criterion collection has a lot on it! There was a documentary and pictures and a lot more neat things! Plus it has his short that he did which is simply amazing.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Bought this game based on the opinions of others and LOVE IT!!  I didn't realize it was a hidden objects based hands-on have played several of those on my PC. This one played on my Kindle Fire and it's been challenging, scary when played alone in a dark bedroom at 2am and very well written.  The graphics are superb and the storyline is amazingly well thought-out!!  I can hardly wait to finish this one and go look for more!!  Keep up the great work! You have another satisfied customer!!<br />NOTE:  Take the advice of a previous after and set it to the most difficult play.  It's far more fun to puzzle the secrets out!!!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Help!  I can't stop playing during the &#34;down times&#34;.  It has taken a while to come up with a better strategy, but you must absolutely collect all extra ball bonuses to move into the higher levels.  I can regularly build up to 600+ balls and 100+ levels following that strategy.  I need to work on the next strategy, as this only places me in the &#60;10,000 place position globally.  It's a great game but does have just a few interface quirks.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is full of action, suspense, and drame...it has too much blood and guts for my liking, but somehow has become a complete addiction!
B009EEFTMC|2.0|After playing it three or four times, I quickly became bored by the simplistic nature of the game.  It is a timed race with all games simply being a matter of clicking the pairs.  There is no possibility for a hung game because of strategy or blocked moves.  I even tried to make it challenging by allowing myself to move the cube around three times.  Even that did not increase the challenge factor.  I will be uninstalling.
B006P0FIGU|4.0|thats all you got to say to make a good movie, the plot follows the tried and true musketeers formula, its a good movie and even the kids can watch it
B008XX6J4C|4.0|These guys are super creative- I always look forward to their new stuff.  We gave this CD as a Christmas Gift for our family.  We all agree it's very enjoyable :)
0670020745|5.0|Book arrived on time and in condition as advertised.  This is an excellent book providing insight in what happens when someone has a stroke and what it takes to recover.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I don't have cable, so I fill my time with spider solitaire.  If I could buy a social life for this price, I suppose I would.  But I can't.  Pathetic, eh?
1451627297|5.0|A great work, one of the best time-travel novels. Stephen King is a master of his trade. Loved like so many of his books. I never tire of his elaborate descriptive works. My favorite author.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|App does what it is supposed to do. Main benefit is it displays larger battery charge level indicator than the tiny little indicator that comes on the Kindle. Kindle should take responsibility for their poor battery indicator. As I said this app does what it is supposed to do. All the other bells and whistles never get used but that is probably true of any other battery app.
B008HK3S9K|4.0|I like this case because it isn't bulky. It's a slim case and it fits nicely into whatever bag I'm carrying. I wasn't looking for a cover to do multiple things. I just wanted a cover to protect it when I travel with it.
B000024ZVL|4.0|just shows you dont need richie blackmore to have a great deep purple sound . ian gillian shines .try it youll like it
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have to say I love the hunger games and this book was the best book ever but I'm still not done now I'm off the to the  final final book Mockingjay!!!!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have been a Bond fan for years and this is by far the best film in years.  Sam Mendes truly understands Ian Fleming's character by bringing out the human qualities in Bond.  Yes, James Bond is an over the top character that can't be destroyed.  Daniel Craig infuses some much life into James.  Judi Dench is amazing as always as &#34;M&#34;.  I can't wait to see how the future of this franchise will continue.  Thank you MGM.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic horses, I'm impressed. Having a lot of fun playing so far. Wish there were more horse breeds though. All of them look the same and it's pretty boring
B0058VW36U|5.0|A cute game where you have to think about what you are going to do.  I have the game on my Kindle Fire and my I-phone.  Great way to pass the time and also entertain the kids.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I couldn't put this one down. I don't know much about science or space travel, but I really didn't need to. Weir's main character explains everything with a deliciously sarcastic tone. The danger, however, feels breathtakingly real. The character development is superb. I could read this book several times and enjoy it every time. You know a book is good when you're disappointed to see the last page.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome my dsughter always wsnted a horse and this shows her what needs to be done to take care of one.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This film was very well done.  You won't find a ton of blood and gore but this movie does a wonderful job at blending a mystery with supernatural aspects.  The ending left me truly disturbed which doesn't happen often as I've been watching horror movies since I was a kid.
B003ES61EE|5.0|This cleaning system is just what I needed to remove all the little specks and what not from my camera lenses.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Addictive to kiddos... my 7 year daughter and her friends LOVE this game! Create your own world and if you know the other world names you can destroy things... hmmmm...  3 D , and creative!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like my horse so far. It's a little glitchy but the graphics are pretty cool. Gems are easy to earn
B0083Z614S|4.0|This was my favorite movie when I was a girl. I knew the movie word for word. Finally got to read the book and it was just as great. Definitely a must read
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a great second book. I can't wait to get the next book. I love that he asked her to marry him.
1419701533|5.0|All five of my kids are reading the books, some have been read twice.<br />I was going to donate to their school but will keep for a bit longer.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|While i enjoyed these books i am left with seeing the difference between self-published works and commercial novels. Good but not great.
B00005UWP1|4.0|It was a movie it was pretty good. But it was slow. The story line was good I liked the flash backs and the music. But even the music was slow. But def. Something to have in your collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I cant put the kindle down!!! When I got it I thought it was going to be one of those games that we going to be so boring but I was wrong. You should totally get this app.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Very cool premise, well executed, and very fun with just the right edge of darkness to it. I'd recommend it.
B005LAIISA|5.0|just when you think...I don't think they can make these characters any better..they do. such a great series, love it
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|One thing about this film that destroyed it for others actually made it for me. This is indeed a film that will probably be confusing and even annoying for those who approach this story for the first time. But for those who are already familiar with it, I think it may just have the opposite effect. I was absolutely delighted with it. If like me you actually recognised the absurdly big PEAR that someone is holding in the first 15 minute or so in the film as the one that Stiva brought home after his indiscretion, you will probably have that sweet feeling that this is an in-joke - not very sexy for those who are not \\"in the know\\", but I personally had no problem with it. Why do all films have to take care of \\"those who don't know the plot\\", especially if it's a classic that's been read all over the world for 100 years? I am from Hong Kong and I am Chinese. I don't find this film difficult or boring or irrelevant or in any way unpleasant. On the contrary I found it very enjoyable to share with the director of this film - obviously a very accomplished artist - HIS TAKE on a story we both know and love. His take may not be my take - but that's precisely the point of artistic appreciation, right?<br /><br />The entire Petersburg society represented by a small crowded theatre, well-dressed people milling about backstage with pulleys and gangplanks, a character walking straight from a stageset into the steppes, etc. may be puzzling and awkward for some viewers. I found it rather fresh, visually interesting and intellectually challenging.<br /><br />To be honest, if authenticity is what you want, this whole thing should be directed by a Russian director, acted by Russian actors and in Russian.  And some of the waiters and street people should have Central Asian faces. If I were Russian I would probably be gagging over Keira Knightley doing a Tolstoyan heroine - but I think forgiving her \\"Englishness\\" she did a good job here!<br /><br />The director and I certainly did not have the same idea about what kind of an animal Vronsky is (and I never imagined Vronsky as having curly blond hair and a baby blue eyes) - but the director really did make me go back to the book to find out what Vronsky really is supposed to be like. I am grateful to this film for that.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|love love love this movie, I bought this movie for my grandson, we both love it, and we have watched it almost everyday for over a week
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A fascinating read, as it is written from the viewpoint of a mentally unbalanced person. I enjoyed the good writing and the story's messages.
0307951529|5.0|Amazingly candid and detailed yet simple and full of wisdom from stories of ordinary people who found the road to freedom. Inspiring!
B00BP4X7TG|4.0|The Banner publication recommended this French film. Subtitles were distinct and readable. Did not feel that I missed any of the movie by reading the subtitles. Enjoyable story as each develops the other. Better, it is based on a true story.<br />David
B000LTAY1U|5.0|If you are tired of buying 3-6 watch batteries at a time, and you still need a watch get this one.  I go hiking and I need a watch to keep track of time. It tells me the date and time, which is all I need. Also it was only $54, try and beat that.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Hard to explain the premise but it was entertaining. I'd recommend it.  It was a different kind of romance movie.  I'm usually not all that crazy about romance movies because they are so predictable but this one had a different twist to it.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Love this classic movie, and my 3 and 1/2 year old daughter loves it too.  Very satisfied!  Thanks so much!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Lots of fun. Hard time putting it down. Can pla y for hours on end. Great way to pass time waiting anywhere.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|This might be the best album the Bealtes ever made and THAT is a BIG statement!!! In My Life is the best song they EVER made. Excellent
B00AZ3027I|1.0|Now I know why my mother didn't allow us to watch this movie more than once: it's full of sexist and racist stereotypes.  Very offensive.  On top of that, it's actually quiet a dull story line.  I wish we could return it and am incredulous that Disney would reissue it.
B005PM3YII|5.0|All I want to say is that the series ends really buy it and enjoy it.  It doesn't disappoint. I see why Brandon was chooses to end the wheel of time this series is beautifully constructed.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|very addicting! ive been playing for two straight nights. I recommend this game. So far Big Fish Games has delivered awesome quality play.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I first really like this book. I watched the movie and feel in love with this book. I choose this rating because it really puts a dent in someone's heart. I would like for Haley Jones to read this book.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was very informative even for singles. I really like the examples given in each chapter to show how the love language could be expressed.
B009ICQ6KO|2.0|Just lacks the soul of true Blues music... although there are a few glimpse of possibility - it just doesn't do it for me.
B00005RHGL|5.0|You made it so easy to look for it , find it , and order it on time to get here! Keep up the good work!
B00979CS50|5.0|How can you go wrong with a Neil Young CD teamed up with his faithful group Crazy Horse...did not disappoint.
B006JJBFK0|5.0|Fans of symphonic metal, or metal fans looking to expand their horizons into operatic or symphonic metal should do themselves a favor and buy this album. Everything about it is really terrific, including and perhaps especially the vocals of their new singer.<br /><br />The metal and soaring vocals meld perfectly together, in my opinion as good or better than I've ever heard before in this type of music.<br /><br />This album has really elevated Xandria in my opinion, and I will be playing this cd for a long time, and will anxiously await their next release and hope it approaches the greatness found here!
1451695195|5.0|Really opens your eyes to what heaven will be like - I'm not afraid anymore! I recommend this book highly.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Great game, really good graphics.  The screens can be a little tricky, it's nice to finally find a game to keep you on your toes!  Good storyline and games are fun, fun fun....
B00A80SHFM|2.0|Disappointed in this album.  I thought that there would be more to it - I guess I should have chosen the original soundtrack to the play or movie instead.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It's a fun little game. The controls seem to be just a bit loose like being on ice but not bad. If you're looking for a fun racer with good graphics, give this one a try.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|This game is so dumb. Don't waste your time. Do anything but play this game. Do not wast your money. Trust me.
B00008977N|1.0|This is the second one of these that I need to return, each from a different vendor.  I don't know what's going on  with this DVD but these all play like a cheap Chinese knock off.  Poor video and audio.  This is better than the last one but still not up to DVD standards.  Video is grainy and audio sounds compressed like it has no dynamic range.  Once again, I've seen this on DVD and on Youtube many times and both are far better than these.  This has to go back.  I'd like to return it for a refund.
1442419814|4.0|Rating: 4<br /><br />When I think about this book, the first thing I always hear in my head is the movie trailer guy saying \\"In a world...where people are born ugly...\\" Which is silly, because this book isn't your typical action/adventure fare. It's so much more.<br /><br />Tally couldn't be more excited. She's about to turn sixteen, and that's when all the uglies have the operation that makes them pretty. She can't wait to follow her best friend, Peris, over to New Pretty Town where the youngest pretties hang out, go to parties and drink champagne. That's all you have to do there, but from what she can tell from sneaking a peek, it's more than enough. All the clothes, food and celebrations that you can handle. Peris is a couple of months older than Tally, and she hopes that when she's reunited with him, they will be together again.<br /><br />The only thing fun to do in Uglyville is to do tricks, like trying to get across the bridge to New Pretty Town without its knowing (or telling) and trying to fool the house monitor into thinking that you're still in bed. Once Peris has been made pretty, and Tally is alone, it's not as much fun. She sneaks into the high rise where Peris lives one night, and though he seems happy to see her, more than just his appearance is different. When she's trying to cross the river back to Uglyville, that's when Tally meets Shay.<br /><br />Discovering that they have the same birthday and the same penchant for doing tricks, Shay helps Tally perfect riding a hoverboard. They sneak out at night and even go down to the Rustie ruins and look around. Then Shay tells Tally about David, a person who is rumored to live in The Smoke, a sort-of mythological area where people don't get made pretty and live off the land. It' a secret place that no one knows how to get to. On a night close to their birthday, Shay breaks the news to Tally: she is waiting for David to come and get her so she can disappear. Tally is sorry to see her go, but Tally wants to be pretty more than anything, and she misses Peris. But before Shay leaves, she gives Tally a cryptic set of directions that will guide her to The Smoke in case she wants to join them later.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Tally, the operation will have to wait. the day of, she is whisked away in a hovercar to Special Circumstances, a place that no one believes really exists. The pretties here look cruel and cold, and Tally is told that she must try and find Shay and The Smoke, or Tally will never be pretty. A few days back in Uglyville and a visit from her parents and Peris are all it takes to make her agree to the demands of Special Circumstances. Because, as they explain it, Shay needs to be rescued from these people who took her. And Tally is the one who needs to find her.<br /><br />One of the first young adult dystopian novels, the world in Uglies states that wars, unhappiness and other bad things were caused because of people's looks. So if everyone was pretty, that would make the world a better place. What most do not know, however, is the extent that this operation changes who you are on the inside. All Tally knows is the propaganda she has been fed and the sights she has seen. Everyone, including her parents and friends that have gone through the procedure, seem so happy.<br /><br />Once Tally finds out that Special Circumstances is real and they want her to betray a confidence, Tally's yearning to go through with the operation is at odds with her desire to keep Shay's secret. Once she agrees with the Specials, and is given a locket she will activate to tell the Specials where she is located, she leaves on her arduous journey to find Shay.<br /><br />Of course, not everything goes as planned. Tally doesn't expect to see so many uglies with so much confidence; that's something that only the pretties have. She certainly never anticipated how much she enjoys working, using tools, being outside. And most of all, she never imagined that she would fall in love with a Smokie.<br /><br />But what about her secret, that she is supposed to betray those who have made her a part of their community? Can she go through with it after she's gotten to know them?<br /><br />The Bottom Line: A fabulous book that shows that things aren't always what they seem, pretty or not.<br /><br />Uglies by Scott Westerfeld was published February 8, 2005 by Simon & Schuster Children's.

B000JMKQX0|3.0|It's was ok. Wouldn't recommend. Slow read. Hope movie is better.  Needs more action or storyline. Can I get my money back?
B007REV4YI|5.0|this movie is epic, not the best bond in my opinion, but it was still pretty epic. a must have for any movie buff or bond fan!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and easy. My son and I enjoy playing. He likes to feed and I like to do championships.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|Great family film, Tim Burton does it again with a retelling of his original live action short. stunning on blu-ray and even better in 3D! Make it a movie night with the family with this heart felt film.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|This is one of my favorite movie soundtracks.  Its relaxing and exciting at the same time.  I love to just let it play and play.
B006G2124E|4.0|I didn't have high expectations for this book when I picked it up because it's not at all like what i normally read.  I decided to read it because my wife was, and I was pleasantly surprised!  Since the story centers on civil rights, I was expecting this to come across like left-wing propaganda.  I was wrong, it was quite balanced and sensible.  I am a white male, but I was drawn into the story and I connected with the black female characters because Ms. Stockett presented them with depth, depicting something universal about them to which everyone can relate.  Our cultures may be different, but not by as much as some people pretend.  I also found The Help to be quite educational because the story vividly provides a link between the past and the world of today.  There is a lot of history intersperced into the story.  It's only been 50 years, and it almost seems surreal how much we've matured in America in such a short time.<br /><br />The movie version of the book does a pretty good job of translating the intentions of the author, although it doesn't necessarily mimic the story verbatim.  I was happy they left out the part about the naked and toothless white guy.  On the other hand, some of the characters, especially Celia Foote, weren't quite what I expected.  Still, a very worthy adaptation.  Worth a look!
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I liked the way the author writes. Great story.  I have bought both of the next two books and expect them to be enjoyable also.  Looking forward to reading more from Miss Stiefvater.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Very good fast moving and exciting. one of the better bond movies. will probably watch again.had not seen a bond movie in a while.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book because it was easy to follow and very exciting. If anyone likes action with a hint of romance The Hunger Games is your book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I finished this trilogy in less then 3 days and I am not in the teenage age group. I could not put it down. It's a stunning commentary on human nature--both the kindness and cruelty that we are all capable of. It's fast paced and full of twists and turns. Collins create such a gritty and vibrant world that its not hard to imagine it with your minds eye.<br /><br />I was also surprised at how closely the first movie follows that books--that's testament to how could it is--even Hollywood couldn't improve it.<br /><br />My only caveat is that if you can't stomach the gory moments -- you may not enjoy this books darker themes or numerous fights/death scenes. It was a bit much for me sometimes but i don't think it was gratuitous -- it was just part I the brutal world  of panem. Without these moments, the rebellion would not be believable.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a great app that is truly entertating. it takes up time and is a great way to distract yourself from Everday activities
B00009V7T2|5.0|I'm not sure what to say about this album but if you are a fan of Mars Volta and don't have this album then you need to get it.  Ranks right up there as one of my favorites.  If you haven't heard Mars yet, then pick this up as your first taste.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I downloaded this app for my daughter because I was looking for a fun,realistic, horse game that she could play long term. For the most part, the game is self explanatory. You care for your horse, train it to enter competitions, and earn money to buy accessories, more horses, or other random things. Like most &quot;free&quot; games, this one also allows you to earn or purchase gems that you'll need for certain items or horses. While the game is enjoyable, there are a few things that keep me from giving this game five stars . First, you are given optional &quot;tasks&quot;. Like most free games, these tasks often cost more money or gems to complete then what you are rewarded with after completion. Also, while a majority of the game is self explanatory, some of the tasks, such as &quot;check your horse's shoes&quot; does not come with directions, and I have no way of figuring out how to actually complete this.<br /><br />For my daughter, the biggest complaint is that when you purchase more horses, they are not kept together in the corral. You have to switch from one horse to another to care for them. She really wanted to be able to see her horses run around together. Also, if you train one horse for a race, it automatically trains the other horse. Or if you are earning money with riding lessons with one horse, the other one cannot earn its own money. Basically, no matter how many horses you have, they pretty much are still just &quot;one &quot; horse. They share energy, money...just not a corral. Overall, its a pretty good game.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I enjoyed the book but it didn't draw me in to the story but I did finish reading it.  I may try the next book later.
B0028IDXDS|2.0|I was kinda bummed that the soothie wasn't clipped to the monkey, it was sewn on. which means no sterilizer and no way to attach it to the other pacifiers my kid takes. kinda lame.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|great little game. great cartoon like graphics. easy handling. I'm glad it was free. wooooot tooooow. so so so so fun.
0679805273|5.0|I bought each of my two children these books. I heard this idea many times and decided to do it for mine. You have each teacher from Kindergarten thru 12th grade write a little something for the kid to remember each year of their school years and gift it to them for graduation. Cute idea.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I'm really not a big fan of pop music but this is pretty damn good!  I love the versatility of the music. It rocks from start to finish. I recommend this one to everyone who likes real music.
B00000295Y|5.0|it is perfect just like one i brought it when it first came out. gotta to love those old school music!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a really fun and realistic and addicting game. I reccomend it to all my friends and family members
1938469011|5.0|All of the books in this series have been great. The information ranges from broad based history to scientific details and everything in between. A great read for casual brewers and serious beer nerds alike.
B00000JMOF|5.0|The item arrived as scheduled, the quality of the dvd is great & my family & I enjoyed viewing it.
B008B92U32|2.0|I thought this app might be fun, but not really. I did not like how it &#34;saved my original pictures&#34;. I also found it to be a little more complcated than I wanted. But I think that if this is your 'thing' than you might appreciate this app more than I do.
B0076DELIG|1.0|For a big fan of the author, I couldn't have been more disappointed.  Sluggish, boring storyline with so many words spent on sidetracked verbage which lends nothing to the story, and just never gets going.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A touching and gripping love story that captures your heart right from the start. Written with great thought and sensitivity.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|This is a collection of twelve cases Sherlock Holmes solved, told through the perspective of his accomplice Watson. All of them are pretty short, which only takes about 1 hour 15 minutes to read one case. However, after a while, the cases start to sound kind of similar. For example, a few of the cases' victims are all enticed by money to do something, then find that it is suspicious, so they seek help from Holmes. A few of the cases sadly involve family conflict, with money and greed being the biggest issues. I liked the last two cases the most, the adventure of the Beryl Coronet and Copper Beeches. I didn't like the man with the twisted lip, because Doyle shouldn't discredit homeless people...<br /><br />Favorite Quote: “If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.&#34; - Sherlock Holmes.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is much more User friendly than the original. I do love them both but this one rocks! I love the zip lines. Not fond of the rails but I am getting better at it.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|** spoiler alert ** This is a very tragic story about two families. One of them lived at Wuthering Heights, thence the book title. It is definitely a page turner, as it kept me hooked to find out what happened next. There was so much drama in the story that it seems like there was never a dull moment. However, the tragic ending made it hard for me to like the book. I can't believe Healthcliff wasn't willing to repent even at the end. He felt no remorse for what he did and didn't understand his love for Catherine wasn't true love. He made everyone miserable. This is such a depressing story, but revealed a lot about human life and the downward spiral of sin.<br /><br />Favorite Quote: &#34;He pressed its hand, and kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.&#34; (Chapter XXXIV)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fun I play it all the time love it.My hole family loves it. I like it more than temple run. This is the best.
B005UG542S|5.0|I really liked the books and of course this movie didn't disappoint. It was exciting and dramatic. Remember crying a bit in the end, but it was a good relieving kind of cry. You gotta watch the movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My sister plays this game all the time.I love it.Very fun!! My sister got 100 eggs.And she got a hoverboard.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is a fictional story about Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who came to know God and his life story. He changed dramatically after being loved by a bishop. Although society condemned him as a law-breaker, his heart is right with God and gave generously to the poor. Even though the policeman Javert kept chasing after him, he didn't seek revenge but repaid evil with grace. At the end, his highest wish is I prayed I lived a life pleasing to God on high. What an amazing testimony! Hugo used Jean's story to describe social injustice very well! Jean committed a petty crime, but the law gave him no grace. There are many women and children suffering from poverty, but the government didn't care about their plight. If you don't have time to read the whole book, you should watch the musical DVD. The musical is 80% as good as the book. It's an amazing story and so touching. I cried a few times reading the book and listening to the song &#34;Bring Him Home.&#34; I don't usually cry watching a book or reading a book, but this story really touched me.<br /><br />I think reading the abridged version would have sufficed. My curiosity and the fact that Kindle only provides the unabridged version for free led me to read the unabridged version. If you are not a big history fan and don't want to read a few chapters about sewers (which kind of give you a glimpse of the poverty and filth the people were experiencing), get the abridged version instead. Although this took me about 3.5 months to read, it was well worth it. The way Hugo depicted the characters, especially Jean Valjean was ineffable. The story captured my attention as I read how Jean Valjean, the bishop, Fantine, Cosette, Marius, Thenardier, and M. Gillenomad's lives intertwined. If you watch the musical instead of reading this book, you would miss the character developments of Marius and Thenardier, and not know Marius' family background. Reading the book gives readers a glimpse of how Marius isn't that wimpy and passive as the musical depicted him. The parts where Thernardier appeared (e.g. at the end when he visited Marius) are so important, I don't understand why the musical left it out. I understand there is time constrains and other considerations, but the musical depicting Eponine delivering the letter instead of Gavroche caused more sympathy for Eponine than it should. Also, the musical completely left out how Marius was rescued. If you want the full story, you have to read the book. I saw the movie in December 2012 and the musical in the fall of 2012, but I still don't regret the time spent reading this book - which was more than a month. :-)<br /><br />Favorite Quote: &#34;They are of silver, but to me they are gold, they are diamonds; they change candles which are placed in them into wax-tapers. I do not know whether the person who gave them to me is pleased with me yonder on high. I have done what I could. My children, you will not forget that I am a poor man...&#34;
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it. Solitaire is my favorite game. I play it all the time. It is a very relaxing game to play.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This is the greatest classic I read so far. I really like how Louisa incorporated many biblical themes into the story and described each little women so well. I especially liked how she depicted Beth's last scene, because she was so peaceful and trusting to God. The movie really didn't depict the book well, as all of the biblical themes were removed. I couldn't understand Laurie's decision at the end by the movie, but the book explained it so much clearer. The ending is also described in the book more vividly than the movie, as you start to understand your own cloud and goals... You will not be disappointed by reading this book! It will help you see God in a new light.<br /><br />Favorite Quote: &#34;Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth, tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the sweet, unselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to make it happier for those who should remain behind.&#34; (Chapter 40)
0788805843|2.0|Cute but unlikely tale of a child born of a god and mortal woman. Although he performed many heroic feats in life, his greatest miracle was choosing to sacrifice himself in death, thus winning resurrection as a god.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Good transition from first Temple Run. Kept a number of the old powers and skills but added some great new parts. Wonderful artwork and all of the new trees and formations makes the game that much harder.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love Firefly and was pissed when Fox canceled it. This is a must own for any fan--even if SciFi shows the series every three months,
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't think there enough great words in the dictionary to describe this book!!! Colleen Hoover is a writing genius!! If I could rate this story a 10 star read, I WOULD! I LOVE IT and that's putting it mildly! Simply PHENOMENAL! After reading Hopeless, I'm HOPELESS!  This book will knock your socks of and leave you speechless.  This book is PERFECTION!<br /><br />I have never been able to read any where close to an entire book in one day, but I came pretty darn close with this one! Once you start reading, Hoover draws you in and never lets you go.<br /><br />This story was such an emotional roller coaster, yet even though parts of the story were gut wrenching, I found myself reading and smiling throughout the majority of the book. It is a story of unwavering unconditional true love and dives into the very core of your soul and bares all of your inner emotions that one may think should never surface.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the continued correlation to the title throughout the entire story. Too often, stories may only have one sentence that references back to the title, however, the references started at the very beginning and followed clear through to the end!<br /><br />The characters are in depth and so lovable. I would like to even clone a little Holder for myself.<br /><br />I honestly don't think that I could ever read another book that I loved so much. Prior to reading this book I never dreamed of wanting to re-read a book, but I loved this book enough to want to read and read and re-read and re-read it again! I just can't get enough of Hopeless!
0553103547|5.0|I had already watched both seasons of Game of Thrones on HBO and found the book to be even better than the miniseries. The show is very accurate to the book and bring to fruition the roughness of life and development of the characters. The book is epic and one that you can't put down once you start reading it.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Interesting read.  Nice perspective and story of his experience but a bit hard to take on as fat.  DId not provide the definitive believable truth but good for thought.

0062082353|5.0|I have recently read Lone Survivor, and No Easy Day both of which are wonderful books.  This one is in a class right with them.  I enjoyed his stories, and seeing his point of view on service, combat, faith, and family.  It paints a great picture of all that is sacrificed by our servicemen and their families.  Also, I found the combat stories great, and there is alot of humor in the book as well.  Thank you for your service Kyle, and for one of the best books out there.

B00ATPVA78|4.0|I played this on my KF with only one issue. While trying to set the clock in the hotel my Kindle crashed. This game is mostly strategy and not a hidden object one. Storyline was ok. I would recommend this game to others.

B0089LOKHG|4.0|Olivier made Lena and Hana's world lift off the page once again. This story immerses you in a world caught in a triangle of love, bore and war. The state of the world both impassioned and resistant. Hana's cured-perspective gives insight into her world in a beautiful way, while Lena's character growth takes on a new depths. Whether you root for Alex or Julian, Lena's journey to choose her heart's desire is believable and well done.<br /><br />For those who like pretty bows, never fear, Lena gains what is most important to her and leaves you satisfied even though questioning about the war and her personal choices. I'm a fan of drawing my own conclusion.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I enjoy this game, but I really enjoy playing this game with the nice music attached to it!  Great product.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love Nolan's movies. If you have a good home theater, this is the track you want to listen to. Crank up the volume and you are in Audio heaven. The BR's don't disappoint at all. I use these to showcase my speakers :-)
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie is such a wonderful encouragement to those parents who have children with ANY special need or even just raising &#34;normal&#34; kids!  Don't quit no matter how hard it seems.  It also was a wonderful example for those that deal with children with autism or asperger's of how these children think and just how far they can go when you work with them.

B003XMXZCW|5.0|Apocalypse now! is not a film about the Vietnam war. Nor about America. Or about war. Or horror. Or madness. Or us. It is a film about everything. It is there it's greatness.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Reading this book was like watching a movie of it in my mind. So many sad and disturbing things happened to the characters in this book, but this is the way it was in those days of plantation owners and slavery. Really enjoyed the book.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I love games that you build and create you're own places!!! It's a fun game app to play it can be addicting!!!
B006Y5H74W|5.0|This is a welcome addition to my love of Broadway musicals.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first season, and it's so much better to watch it at my leisure (which is all at once) than waiting for each episode each week.  However, since getting hooked and watching season 2, I feel that the first season was much better in terms of dialogue, choreography and character development.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome it's very addicting and fun!!! It has alot more obtacles than the first one which makes it challenging!!!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Wow this is so fun.  Hours upon hours wishing had more time to play it.Thinking about joining facebook just to share my scores.

B002M5E2DW|5.0|I think some of the ideas are very good and hopeful above all.<br />I don't know if everybody is ready to apply its contents to daily life, but it is definitely worth trying.<br />I have enjoyed the reading very much.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|What can I say, this is by far one of the best app games I own. That being said there isnt much else to say for a game that only costs .99&cent;.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So good. Can't wait for the next book. I'm going to have to break down and buy it. I borrowed this one from the kindle prime library.
B00BS4U8VS|3.0|When was the last time this show was scary?  The biters have become mere pests. They are no longer a real threat. Little Carl is much more frightening.  By Episode 13 of Season 3, dealing with the Zs has deteriorated into a game. When the zombies are treated like gnats, it's time to play the theme from \\"Jaws.\\"  Dudes, the shark has been jumped.<br /><br />And what's with all this yakking. Is this The Talking Dead?  Episode 13 seems to be where things are bottoming out. Not one real fright in the hour. Rick and the Governor, still battling it out for Who is Nuttier, are at a sitdown at the behest of Andrea, a woman who can't see the forest or the trees. Her boyfriend keeps his zombie daughter in the breakfront, has a collection of living zombie heads in the parlor, stages gladiator fights with zombies, and she doesn't get it that he's a little, you know, odd?<br /><br />Anyway, the episode starts out reasonably well: Old Herschel is along as Rick's protection because when the going gets tough, there isnothing like an elderly one-legged man to provide back up, right?  But intriguingly, he has a gun and a knife strapped to his stump. Points for originality. And the Guv has a gun hidden under the sit-down table.  Okay, looks like we are going to have some action...the conflict will be resolved and one of the boys won't be going home. Yeah...dream on.  Rick and the Governor stare at one another meaningfully.  For minutes on end. And they talk. And they talk and they talk. Come on...we are not watching this show for the dramatic insights into their characters, we know the governor is insane and is determined to wipe out Rick's people, so why watch him pretend otherwise for most of the episode?  Enough dialogue...we want action, chills, terror. Otherwise we'd be watching some hip Indie film with Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken. And when some Zs do show up, dispatching them is almost an afterthought.  Enter the shark.<br /><br />In addition to Rick and Guv's talk fest, other even more boring characters are highlighted.  Maggie and Glenn do their best to turn this into As The Zombie Turns as they examine where their relationship went wrong and then have a little gratuitous sex to keep those teenage boys tuning in.  Glenn is my least favorite character. He gets everything wrong and, when left in charge of the prison, decides to abandon his post and have a make out session with his galpal instead.  Ah, young love.  If a zombie singles him out, I will gladly provide condiments.<br /><br />Merle, the one-armed psychopath, is the only one who makes sense, wanting to take out the governor by sneaking up on him and whacking him. But the politcally correct Glenn won't stand for this. Another reason to dislike the little squirt.<br /><br />The show is becoming painful.  Let's have some more chills. I want the Walking Dead to scare me to death, not bore me to death. For a show that started out so well...the first episode was enough to induce nightmares, it's now a parody.  Please, please, scare the daylights out of us again. Make the biters scary again, not just little flies to annoy and be swatted away.  This may be the problem...the make up people have so many great ideas for creating rotted corpses, they have overdone it. Too many zombies and we get too used to them.  One zombie shuffling toward you in the dark, arms outstretched, coming at you slowly  but inexorably as you look around and see no way out...that's terrifying. But endless swarms of them shambling along and getting their poor little noggins busted over and over and over again?  Not so much.  Give us the Horror. Give us the Zombies...not the zzzzzzzzzzz.other even more boring characters are highlighted.  Maggie and Glenn do their best to turn this into As The Zombie Turns as they examine where their relationship went wrong and then have a little gratuitous sex to keep those teenage boys tuning in.  Glenn is my least favorite character. He gets everything wrong and, when left in charge of the prison, decides to abandon his post and have a make out session with his galpal instead.  Ah, young love.  If a zombie singles him out, I will gladly provide condiments.<br /><br />Merle, the one-armed psychopath, is the only one who makes sense, wanting to take out the governor by sneaking up on him and whacking him. But the politcally correct Glenn won't stand for this. Another reason to dislike the little squirt.<br /><br />The show is becoming painful.  Let's have some more chills. I want the Walking Dead to scare me to death, not bore me to death. For a show that started out so well...the first episode was enough to induce nightmares, it's now a parody.  Please, please, scare the daylights out of us again. Make the biters scary again, not just little flies to annoy and be swatted away.  This may be the problem...the make up people have so many great ideas for creating rotted corpses, they have overdone it. Too many zombies and we get too used to them.  One zombie shuffling toward you in the dark, arms outstretched, coming at you slowly  but inexorably as you look around and see no way out...that's terrifying. But endless swarms of them shambling along and getting their poor little noggins busted over and over and over again?  Not so much.  Give us the Horror. Give us the Zombies...not the zzzzzzzzzzz.

B00AFOS8A0|5.0|2013 has been proclaimed Verdi year, being the 200th anniversary of Verdi's birth. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that Verdi is by far the most important composer for the repertoire of most opera houses today. Think of Aida, Don Carlos, Falstaff, Il trovatore, La forza del destino, La traviata, Macbeth, Nabucco, Otello, Rigoletto, Simon Boccanegra, Un ballo in maschera - nobody else has written that many operas that are part of the core repertoire of most opera houses today.    This is a truly outstanding collection. 67 of the 75 CDs are devoted to 30 complete operas, the other 8 CDs to Verdi's non-operatic works. La forza del destino and Don Carlo(s) are both included in two different versions each.    This set does include two \\"books\\" (booklet size, approx. 530 pages in total) with notes (for each opera, the cast and recording date/location as well as a one-page summary of each opera in English, French, and German, and a track-by-track summary of one paragraph per track in English, French, and German), but no libretti. However, with 30 operas, this isn't really surprising - the set would have to be much bigger, heavier, and more expensive if such an extraordinary amount of libretti had been included. I don't think that libretti can be reasonably expected if you pay less than $6 per opera.    What I really like about this box set is the quality of the recordings. I have listened to Aida, Oberto, and Un giorno di regno so far, and to various samples on the Decca website - see [...]and these are truly top-notch recordings. Many box sets have some highlights as well as several weaker recordings, but Decca has usually been very careful in making sure that their box sets have very high quality throughout, and this is also true for this box set here. Having said that, one reviewer on the German Amazon website has identified Il trovatore (Giulini 1984) and La forza del destino (regular version, Sinopoli 1985) as weaker parts of this box set.    I think that this box set is an excellent value and offers plenty of top-quality recordings of opera's most popular composer. Highly recommended!

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|hit all the right notes for me. only complaint was the running time as it dragged somewhat in the middle.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|It was good.  Anthony Bourdain has had an interesting life that is told from a witty and charming attitude.<br />I like food and reading about the industry but some of the lengthy descriptors about food prep and kitchen processes bored me but I'm not an intense foodie,, chef or part of the food industry nor care to be which may account for my boredom.  Also, his descriptors at the beginning where he states the reader is going to shocked and perhaps disgusted by the industry is a bit much, as his perspective was interesting but nothing that was shocking of a look behind the scenes of a restaurant, although entertaining for the most part.<br />Where his career has taken him and his personal anecdotes were great and amusing.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|dredd was much better than I expected it to be. I didn't look at the time once during the movie.

B000063K2W|5.0|This was very innovative, as Ms. Russell described in her autobio.  I loved the clothes and behavior of the era, too.<br />I noticed there is a remake out, but it doesn't interest me.  I've already seen the best!
B000TCEU4Q|3.0|I had a very hard time configuring the controls and the directions they give you are very conplicated and confusing.  I also have a CH multi control quadrant and it was much simpler and easier to set up and understand.  Once I finally got it setup it performed fine
B00A7OIXW6|2.0|Just bought Hotel Translyvania and love it... my daughter Adores it!!! Mavis... cute, cute movie. I thought this seemed pretty mainstream and so must be good. Wow! it is not and now I am going to have to watch it. My daughter, 5, doesn't get that excited or asks for it so I think it is a flop. For me, I love the kids movies with sneaked in adult humour for after all we are the ones that end up watching it a lot with them. I thought this movie was just Dumb. No human story, no path to follow, no nothing. Silverman was cute but then got very annoying. My kid didn't like it and I didn't like it. Watch Hotel Translyvania and SEE the difference. One has life the other is searching for a plot. Kids movie... mine didn't like it so much. Yours? For the parents... you will find it very annoying. It was a bummer... thought it would of been good. Don't waste your money. No idea how this got the PUSH that it did. FLOP.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|This movie was the best James Bond movie I have seen since Sean Connery was 007. I absolutely loved this movie

B009LMTDL0|4.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B00AGIVNVG Their Journey to the PhD]],I know first-hand about women, my PhD Sisters, who want to inspire and be leaders while balancing home, family, and self. This is a good read to insight thoughtful discussion to achieve something great for women. While we all take different journey's, we can create a path that many women can follow by sharing our actions! I highly recommend this book for anyone to read but especially for young women who have a dream. Lean In and Move Forward!
1611761557|5.0|For years I wondered what John would say if he wrote a book about his journey in life. And my wish finally came true! I bought the autographed audio CD and I just fell in love with John all over again. I couldn't help myself. He answered alot of questions that I'd had for years about his childhood and his teenaged years. All the who, what, where, when, why and how stuff. John just filled in all these blanks and question marks. And now it's like I can relax now because a lot of what I knew was based on rumors that were not true. But I did wish he talked about Neuotic Outsiders or anything he did solo. But it's OK. The book is great over all. No complaints.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. It's just like the game in the arcade. I play it for hours at a time. Vert fun.
B009GFEOY8|5.0|I use the film for my artistic projects (Absolutearts.com/royanecaldwell) and love it.  I'm happy the sx-70 film is still available.  Do you have a special price for bulk ordering.
0385349947|5.0|Appreciating the fury of debate around this book, I encourage everyone to read it with the positive intent with which it was written. I've been a professional for the past 32 years, a senior partner at a major consulting firm, a leader in our firm's women's initiative and the author of HOW REMARKABLE WOMEN LEAD - and I got a ton out of this book! I love that Sheryl started Lean In (a non-profit) with her own money, and she is donating the proceeds of this book to help Leanin.org. I love that she cares so much about young women that she has taken time out to write a book and step up into the public debate. That takes courage. On to the book! With humor and modesty, Sheryl helps us with great counsel - and of course it is up to us whether to take it or not. I still push myself to 'sit at the table' and was glad to see she has to push herself, too. I still hold back from taking on the next opportunity, but with Sheryl as my coach, I am raising my hand! Let's recognize that women are not one homogenous interest group - we're certainly all different and our interests are shared but not the same! So take from this book what you will, whether you're just out of school or just entering middle management or just reaching for the top. Thanks to Sheryl Sandberg for being our lightening rod!<br /><br />And whatever you choose to do, make a difference with the strengths you have within you. That's the surest way to happiness and to living a meaningful life.<br /><br />All the best,<br />Joanna Barsh

B0060ZJ78U|4.0|Pros: I'm not going to say that I'm in love with Brad Pitt or anything, but... isn't he dreamy? Sadly, we aren't treated to any shirtless Brad, but he is shown working out a few times and is generally wearing form-fitting shirts. On the flip side, we are also not treated to any shirtless Jonah Hill, so... That's always appreciated. I don't really know anything about Billy Beane, but as far as I can tell, Pitt's character is how I would want Beane to be. He does a quality job of breaking out his dramatic chops of yesteryear while still including some of that boyish goofy charm that he has more recently developed. Speaking of acting, for all of you wondering what Jonah Hill's name is doing among the nominees for best supporting actor, please allay your fears. While I can't speak for every single supporting actor who appeared in a film in 2011, I can say that Hill's dramatic skills are indeed present, and I don't think he is misplaced with his nomination. He portrays the intellectual baseball nerd affably well (I didn't use \\"affably\\" correctly there, so don't bother looking it up to check me), and the only thing I would have liked more is if the movie had dived more deeply into the new age baseball metrics. But that's probably just the nerd side of me talking; I'm sure I don't speak for everyone.<br /><br />Cons: Does Brad Pitt have a bet with someone about the number of times he can be seen eating on camera? Not just in this movie, but in all of his movies of late. And not just any food, but generally junk food that he's just shoveling into his mouth... Is he trying to brag about his metabolism or something? I don't really get it.<br /><br />What I do get, however, is what a five tool player is. And I understood that after the first time those five tools were listed out. The next couple dozen listings weren't really necessary for me to grasp the concept. I suppose it's the point of the movie that baseball scouts and executives focus on the wrong things, but aren't there any other wrong things for them to focus on, other than fielding, running, throwing, hitting, and/or hitting with power?<br /><br />And while we're at it, let's remember that we're talking about scouts who have been doing this thing for decades, and who have known those same five tools and been making the same assessments about kids for many years. Why do they need to stumble over their words? Shouldn't they know all this by now? I'm assuming there's a desire by some directors of \\"true stories\\" to have spoken lines be a little more clumsy and sputtered, because, you know, that's how real people talk. This makes me a little torn. Yes, I like realism. But at the same time, I go to the theaters in part to escape reality. If I want to listen to old men stumble over their words while they describe in broad, sweeping statements how good a ballplayer is, I'll go to the Polo Grounds. In the meantime, I'd like to watch these highly skilled actors deliver their lines with a greater degree of comfort (within their roles, of course), while I, as a responsible movie-goer, bear in mind that I am not, in fact, looking through a window on the real world.<br /><br />While I'm not looking through a window at the real world, though, I am looking at a portrayal of it. And in this particular case, I'm looking at a portrayal of a baseball team that has been \\"gutted.\\" Who did they lose again? Oh right, I should remember since they repeated the names Giambi, Damon, and Isringhausen even more often than the five tools mentioned previously. Even with this gutting, the A's still had the best starting rotation in baseball along with one of the elite shortstops in the game. And despite this flash back to reality, the screenwriters and director feel the need to hit you in the face with a dramatic 2x4 when you watch their movie.<br /><br />Overall: That being said, the movie did suck me right in. It was well-made, with good pacing, compelling characters, an interesting enough story, and a thoroughly woven theme. And when some of the dialog wasn't awkwardly stuttered through, it was sharp and entertaining. Oh, did I mention the movie has Brad Pitt? I'm sheepishly giving it an 8 out of 10, while taking a step back to remind myself that I just saw a movie about generally managing a baseball team, not about curing cancer.
B008HTQ28K|5.0|True Grisham style.  Very interesting.  I couldn't put it down!  The suspense was killing me...!  A worthwhile read for all Grisham fans as well as anyone interested in a true-to-life suspense novel.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Why you shouldn't see it:<br /><br />The strength of Argo also happens to be its weakness. More so than a lot of modern Hollywood fare, this is a film about its story, and that story is about people in a not envious situation. It has been branded as a \\"thriller,\\" but despite a riot at the beginning and some brief \\"action\\" at the end, the majority of this movie's \\"thrills\\" and plot advancement are presented in the form of dialog and tense expressions. Accordingly, if you aren't one to care about the story of a hostage crisis in the early 80's, you probably won't care about this movie, since there isn't much in the way of real exciting set pieces or even off-color moments to take your mind off of the tension of it all.<br /><br />As I'm sure you're aware, Argo is based on true events. I can't speak for everyone, but movies that are supposed to have any relation to true events can make me uncomfortable. Did you know that Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Silence of the Lambs were both \\"inspired by\\" the same events? I'm a big fan of getting things right if you're going to try to tackle actual history, or you may as well just make up your own story and let it succeed (Silence of the Lambs) or fail (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) on its own merits. I can't speak for the veracity of any of these true events, since they're based on a top secret operation that no one even knew about until 20 years after it happened. Even now most people just remember the events surrounding this movie and not the events of the movie itself. That can be a smart move by a filmmaker, as it means you can tell the story how you think it needs to be told. On the other hand, it can be a risk, because you're telling a story about which no one necessarily cares.<br /><br />Why you should see it:<br /><br />Ben Affleck. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, \\"Blake, I've seen Ben Affleck, and I've seen enough Ben Affleck.\\" Well you're kind of missing the point. Honestly, he does a fine job acting in Argo, though I wouldn't say his work is anything special. But did you know that Affleck also directs movies? He has only directed two movies (Gone Baby Gone and The Town) previous to this one, but I wouldn't rate either of them below \\"very good,\\" and this one follows in their quality footsteps.<br /><br />I just finished saying that Argo is about very little other than its story about people talking about a stressful situation. To further complicate the task for the filmmaker, everyone already knows how the story ends. And yet, despite these handicaps, Affleck somehow makes a suspenseful movie! There was a woman next to me in the theater, saying things aloud to the screen, along the lines of, \\"No, don't go through that door!\\" It's hard to explain how exactly this suspense is pulled off, but I think it has mostly to do with skilled actors playing identifiable characters in intimate settings. When the embassy gets stormed, you feel like you're about to get blindfolded and gagged by the mob yourself. When Affleck's Mendes is talking to Cranston's O'Donnell about how six Americans are about to get lynched for no good reason (depending on your viewpoint, I guess), you feel like you're standing right there next to them.<br /><br />Speaking of Affleck and Cranston, it's possible I didn't give enough credit to the former earlier. The role of Mendes as a character is to be the steadying force for the rest of the characters and story, and he performs that role admirably. Because Affleck is able to pull this off, the character actors like Cranston, Goodman, and Arkin are able to present their own characters as the film's much needed engaging changes of pace. That being said, the highlights of the movie as far as entertainment factor goes are definitely those very same character actors. Their interplay with each other and Affleck is always worthy of screen time, and I spent a good deal of the movie waiting for the next time one of them would pop up.<br /><br />In Short:<br /><br />Asyou may remember me saying before, this movie isn't about anything more than a fairly straightforward story, so you're left at the end of it wondering in part what the point was. But I will say that the ability of the filmmakers to take a story that everyone knows the ending to and turn it into a suspense thriller is, well, impressive. Honestly, Ben Affleck as a capable storyteller doesn't come as a surprise, as he has a - admittedly limited - pedigree of making quality films. To make this particular quality film, he successfully turns an otherwise straightforward story into one of entertaining and empathetic characters in a surprisingly suspenseful situation. As far as talking movies go, I rate this one as an 8 out of 10, and I recommend it for anyone who can appreciate a good historical suspense/thriller/drama.<br /><br />Exceptions to the recommendation:<br />- if you have had too much Ben Affleck;<br />- if you positively identify with revolutionary Iran;<br />- if you have incredibly sensitive ears;<br />- anyone for whom suspenseful situations lead to nothing more than stress and high blood pressure;<br />- individuals who would like to go on thinking that the \\"Canadian Caper\\" was, in fact, Canadian;<br />- if you prefer to keep Hollywood as far as possible away from your understanding of historical events;<br />- people who would like to remain blissfully unaware that Ben Affleck is a worthwhile Hollywood type when placed safely behind the camera.
B005HSL626|2.0|My niece has this on her tablet and it is a lot of fun, but I couldn 't get it to work on my android phone
B0072GPPNC|2.0|Pros: Steven Spielberg. War movie.<br /><br />Cons: I don't mean the above in some sort of, \\"That's all that needs to be said\\" mentality. That's actually all that can be said. Only the above is still misleading. When I say \\"Steven Spielberg,\\" I mean that someone traveled back to the 1950's to find a Spielberg still in grade school who does not yet know how to identify good plots or scripts or make them into good movies, and then had him make this movie. And when I say \\"war movie,\\" I mean that if any war was in this movie, I guess that part ended up on the cutting room floor. When it finished, my roommate Jeff asked, \\"Did I just watch a PG war movie?\\" No, Jeff. Somehow, against all odds, this movie stumbled its way into a PG-13 rating. My guess is that the more severe rating was the result of, \\"Contains no rainbows or lollipops. Allusions to violence and less happy places.\\"<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I need to take a moment here. The fact that Spielberg directed this movie is really hurting my heart. Since the 80's, if he wasn't making movies that will literally change your life upon watching (e.g. Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List), he was at least making movies that were endlessly fun to watch (e.g. Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park). Seriously, look at his directing filmography. Seven of my forty favorite movies had Spielberg at the helm. And the rest (that I've seen) are at least highly rated, if not top rated. So why the hell did he make this movie? It's killing me. No matter how many times I check the IMDB page, his name is still right there, under \\"director.\\"<br /><br />The horse is the character that you care about the most, which I guess is the point. The problem is that the previous statement really isn't saying much, and I actually worded it wrong. What I meant to say was, \\"The horse is the only character that you care about at all.\\" The whole movie attempts to be one big stab at sentimentality, but it falls flat on its face, because sentiment is best savedfor, you know, things that you care about.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure the only reason this movie got any positive press (and... *sigh*... an Oscar nomination) is because it's about a horse, which apparently gives it some sort of credibility. If you were to take the exact same plot, characters, script, and actors, but replace the horse with another, less traditionally revered animal, it almost certainly would be laughed out of every movie house in existence.<br /><br />Separated by war. Tested by battle. Bound by friendship... War Goat.<br /><br />Overall: The best that I can say for it is that I never really looked at the clock. But I'm pretty sure at this point that the main reason I never looked was because I was waiting with baited breath for this to turn into a Spielberg movie (i.e. a movie that I enjoy watching). Right up to the moment when the screen turned black for the closing credits, I was convinced that Spielberg was just toying with me, and that the good part of the movie was right around the corner. Then the closing credits came, followed by all those copyright things at the very end for things like Dolby sound and Technicolor, and then the screen went black, and then... Steven Spielberg forced me to disgrace him with a 4 out of 10. I actually think a movie about a goat would have at least been funny at parts.
B0085Y4JF0|4.0|Very well made. Mags go in and come out easy yet held in firmly with bunji cords. Would prefer to be able to remove the pistol mag pouches. Fits well once on but can be difficult to put on and take off. Very comfortable rig.
B005LAIII0|3.0|Why you shouldn't see it:<br /><br />Not to give away too much about this particular movie, but... it drags at parts. While it doesn't necessarily feel any longer than its two hour runtime, it does feel every minute of it. Have you ever watched a movie that takes place entirely on a lifeboat? Well, neither have I, but I've now seen half of a movie that takes place entirely on a lifeboat. I understand there's another movie - titled, coincidentally enough, Lifeboat - that takes place entirely on a lifeboat. Maybe someday I'll watch that Hitchcock piece, but until then I'll have to settle for this particular lifeboat-centric movie. Okay, okay, I have exaggerated slightly how much of this movie takes place on a lifeboat. The parts of the movie that take place on the lifeboat aren't technically entirely on the lifeboat, as there is also the 20-or-so-foot radius of open water around the lifeboat where some action also takes place. So there's that.<br /><br />This one actually reminds me a fair amount of Cast Away in that the majority of the movie leans heavily on the ability of a single character to engage the audience's interest while he does nothing more than try to survive in extraordinary circumstances. The problem with that comparison is that Suraj Sharma is no Tom Hanks (full disclosure: I have an almost creepy respect for Tom Hanks' acting chops, so I may be biased here). While the latter half of Cast Away thrives on Hanks' ability to make otherwise mundane onscreen moments incredibly intriguing, Life of Pi just doesn't have as strong a feature actor to revolve its survival story around.<br /><br />Strangely, some of the more dragging parts of the movie happen before Pi ever fatefully sets foot on a boat. Since the story isn't so much about a lifeboat as it is about a boy and the man that boy becomes, there's the sometimes regrettable necessity of building a backstory about where this person is coming from. It's hard to explain, but there is just something about this backstory that doesn't hold my attention nearly as well as others (for example, Cast Away). As a general rule, I spent a fair amount of the first half of the movie wondering things like, \\"When are they getting on the boat?\\", \\"Why are they not on the boat yet?\\", \\"Why do Indians wiggle their heads like that when they talk? Do they think it conveys any message to the listener other than induced confusion?\\", and, \\"Wait, does this movie even have a boat in it?\\"<br /><br />Why you should see it:<br /><br />Perhaps above I didn't mention a fairly big (literally and figuratively) additional character in the movie, specifically in the lifeboat: an adult male Bengal tiger. The tiger has a name, but I won't spoil that for you, and I will just refer to it here as \\"tiger.\\" So anyway, what you thought was going to be a nice, laid back, somewhat boring adventure on a lifeboat turns out to be, in fact, a second-by-second struggle for survival against a freaking Bengal tiger. In case you're not as familiar as I am with Bengal tigers, just know that they average 500 pounds and are considered to be the most aggressive subspecies of an animal that is known to occasionally eat people.<br /><br />Tiger has a funny name in the movie, and I will give credit to the author and screenwriter for occasionally adding in appropriate moments of humor and everyday humanity into an extraordinary coming of age story. If it hadn't been for the occasional giggle moments in the first half of the movie, I'm not sure I would have made it to the second half. Well, that's an exaggeration, since I'm pretty thoroughly stubborn when it comes to finishing movies, and even more so when it comes to best picture nominees. Still, suffice it to say that there wasn't much to hold my attention for the first hour.<br /><br />All that being said, there is really one main reason that anyone would want to see Life of Pi, and that reason has everything to do with an appreciation for visual art. Once the film reaches theboat, nearly every frame of the movie one could take, frame, and put it up on his or her wall. The visuals are stimulating not only due to the fact that they include crystal clear detail and vivid, saturated colors, but they also depict images that are not frequently seen. You may not be aware, but an adult male Bengal tiger does not often chill out on a lifeboat playing with flying fish in the middle of the ocean. Even in little moments, Lee finds ways to create visual art out of his material. When the opening credits are rolling over footage of a small Indian zoo, the words on the screen behave like the animals on the screen. Sometimes it's the little things.<br /><br />In Short:<br /><br />Life of Pi is visually breathtaking at moments and beautiful for the rest of it. If you have interest in seeing it and aren't opposed to the whole 3D phenomenon, I recommend it as a readily available way to suck you even further into the visuals Lee has created. The story drags at parts for me, and but for the payoff at the end (which I won't spoil for you), I would be happy to write the whole thing off as eye candy and nothing more. But that payoff is there, and as a consequence I've been thinking about it since I saw it almost a week ago. If it weren't for the occasional slowness of the movie itself, I would rate it higher, but for now I'll settle at a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who likes pretty things and/or exploring the nature of storytelling.<br /><br />Exceptions to the recommendation:<br />- anyone who would prefer to believe that there is no beauty in the world;<br />- people who are frightened by adult male Bengal tigers (just kidding, because that should really be anyone/everyone, and I'm not going to recommend that no one see this movie just because of a healthy respect for one's own mortality when near that particular ornery feline);<br />- militant atheists... I guess I should have mentioned somewhere that this story is set up as proof that God existsand has a fair amount to do with religion... oops;<br />- racists (who aren't Indian);<br />- homophobes who want to stick it to Ang Lee (figuratively) for daring to make a movie about gays (this movie doesn't have any gays to my knowledge, but I figure sticking it to Lee for Brokeback Mountain by not watching Life of Pi makes about as much sense as homophobia in general);<br />- people who don't like irrational numbers.

B005MYEPXC|3.0|Pros: Woody Allen's famously witty and neurotic tendencies are made more human and approachable by Owen Wilson, whose Gil is a very familiar character to the ones he's played in the past and strikes me as a good stepping stone into the world of Allen. I really appreciate the fact that this movie is a statement on this year's Academy Awards, where only one nominee for best picture is firmly grounded in the present. Allen really couldn't have picked a better year to make this into an Academy-worthy film, as its overarching theme serves to incredulously point out the irony of its inclusion in the nominees this year in particular.<br /><br />Cons: As much as I can appreciate most of Gil's personality, I just can't relate to his unabashed love of the city of Paris. Since I've never been there, I will admit that this might have to do with my deep-seated reactionary attitude toward all things French. But honestly, what's so great about every street, building, sign, and cobblestone in that city? Also, pretty much every character in this movie not named Gil could stand to receive a hearty punch in the face. I probably wouldn't have fared very well in the 1920s, listening to speech patterns like that all the time. Speaking of the 1920s, I felt like I could have stood to know a bit more about that generation of writers, musicians, and artists to really appreciate a good deal of the portrayals and references littered throughout the movie. Although if Hemingway reads like he spoke in this, I'm glad I haven't read his books after all.<br /><br />Overall: I won't say I disliked watching the movie, and there were a number of moments that made me actually laugh out loud (something I'm not typically wont to do alone in a dark room). However, I spent most of the movie wondering if it would arrive at an eventual point and whether I would care. Ultimately it did wind up with a theme that I believe ought to be quite strenuously stressed with some people, but it wasn't enough to make me think of it as anything other than a \\"cute\\" film that really only garners a best picture mention due to this particular year's crop of nominees. After some wrestling with an eight rating, I eventually settled on a 7 out of 10.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I received the case in the mail and it is broken so I emailed the company 3 times and no answer. A waist of time and money.
B005J6LKVI|4.0|Pros: The entire cast does a fantastic job of filling the roles that they were chosen to fill. Specifically, Viola Davis makes the most of her limited opportunity and turns her character into an appropriate central figure, while Octavia Spencer makes a fine effort of stealing every scene she's in. I would think it would take some courage on the part of Bryce Dallas Howard to play the role she was cast in, as most people, upon viewing, might be tempted to see her as the \\"Godless woman\\" that she portrays. I always have a little extra respect for those actors all while I'm struggling not to yell at their characters through the screen. The highlight performance to me, however, is Jessica Chastain, who depicts an individual incredibly lovable in her naivete. She just doesn't realize that black people are supposed to be viewed as second class citizens by their white - and superior (<-- sarcasm) - counterparts, which makes her the most easily likable character in the movie (to me).    Cons: I tend to struggle with works like this. On the one hand, it appears to be doing some good by shedding light on the sh***y circumstances for black people in the deep south during the time of segregation. On the other hand, however, there is room for the argument that it doesn't go far enough, and that it is arguably still detrimental to equality by continuing some stereotypes. I generally end up siding with the idea that any progress is a positive sign, and the only ultimate \\"cure\\" for inequality is time, while movies like this (and hopefully real world people like some of the characters in it) can help usher along the process.    But I do still have a hard time with dialog as cliche and hard to swallow as, \\"You is good, you is kind, you is special.\\" I can't say for certain whether this kind of dialog is appropriate to the time, place, and people. I'm aware that African American Vernacular English does exist, but I'm hardly an expert on it, and as such I cannot figure out where my comfort line should be drawn with its use. Parts of the dialog in this movie seemed to make, for instance, the strong central figure of Aibileen still appear weak. Some aspects of the script were actually pretty good and entertaining, with sharp and funny dialog and a plot worth following after the first half hour or so. But then Davis gets saddled with lines like that... It really is pretty impressive that she was able to shine through some of what the author/scriptwriter decided she ought to say.    Something that bothered me on a bit more of a superficial level was the fact that Emma Stone's character was supposed to be unattractive. I understand Hollywood likes to cast attractive young actresses as \\"the ugly girl,\\" but they at least generally try to make her look ugly. This movie didn't even try to do that. Stone just kept walking around, looking her normal cute self, while everyone referred to how visually unappealing she was. Let's have a little more effort there, filmmakers...    Overall: A number of scenes were indeed entertaining to watch, but all too much of it just made me uncomfortable. I don't blame the movie, of course, for portraying people and situations that are all too real and have every reason to make me uncomfortable (oh yea, and pretty angry). I encourage you to sit down and watch it, and if you are able to sit through the whole thing without being bothered by the actions of any of the white people in it, tell me so that I can know I have no interest in talking to you ever again. All told, it's a decent movie with good acting, an engaging plot, and a shaky script, and that ultimately doesn't really have anything other than a decent message to make it special. While wanting to give it a higher rating because I believe in the idea behind the story, I ended up giving it a 7 out of 10 just because the movie itself didn't knock my socks off.

B009AMANH4|4.0|Why you shouldn't see it:<br /><br />Talking. If you aren't a fan of having dialog in your movies, then Lincoln probably isn't for you. So if you're one of the folks who voted for The Artist last year, you may not be too fond of this one. But, good thing for this movie, only two films lacking in dialog in the history of the Academy Awards have ever won best picture, and if all of the dialog was removed from this movie, it would probably just consist of opening and closing credits. And that would be a shame, because these are some old school credits without any entertainment value on their own.<br /><br />Politics. It's not that they're spending the duration of the movie talking about anything. They spend the whole time talking in, about, and around politics. Even in what you would think would be personal family moments, there are still at least strong political undertones to the conversation. So you can imagine the scenes that are set in the political arena, where political discourse would make a good deal more sense. There are lots of men with funny hair saying lots of things to posture themselves in the debate.<br /><br />History. In case you hadn't gathered, the plot of this film takes place in an historical setting, a little less than 150 years ago. And no, it's not an historical fiction, where they just take the setting and then add in a really crazy plot, a la Wild Wild West. It's a straight up history, 90% of which takes place within landmarks such as the White House and the Capitol Building (the one in Washington, D.C.). So if histories make you uncomfortable and/or bore you to tears, this one might not hold your interest.<br /><br />Why you should see it:<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis. This part is probably obvious. Or maybe it isn't obvious. If I'm going to be honest with you, I'll tell you that I watched this entire movie trying to convince myself that I was, in fact, watching Daniel Day-Lewis and not Abraham Lincoln. Try as I might, I was laughably unsuccessful. I could look the man right in the beard and not tell him from the man who lived a century and a half ago. I'm not sure what to say about Day-Lewis, other than the fact that I'm glad his method acting didn't lead him to demand that they film Lincoln's assassination using a real gun. With real bullets. I want to see more movies with this man being someone completely and totally not himself.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones. He plays a supporting character (congressman Thaddeus Stevens), obviously, so his role isn't quite as prominent as Day-Lewis', but that doesn't mean he isn't essential to the film. And it's good for you that he is, because every time he shows up on camera, he steals the scene. His ornery attitude and the fact that he's a representative from Pennsylvania may make you think he's from Philadelphia, but he shockingly is not. His witty, sarcastic characterization frequently brings a much-needed lightness to the film.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg. I'm not sure there was a person I was more disappointed in last year than Steven Spielberg. The fact that he would ever even think about releasing a movie as terrible as War Horse just makes me sad in my heart. The good news is that he has acquitted himself nicely here. He takes a moment of American history, finds the story behind it, and creates a gripping, expertly told tale. Much like Affleck with Argo, Spielberg is somehow able to make the audience feel suspense over the outcome of a plot that it already knows. It's not like Congress skipped the 13th Amendment. He's also done a fantastic job of casting, from the notable (and award-recognized) efforts of Day-Lewis, Jones, and Sally Field to any of the rest of the ensemble cast. Every time you turn around, there is another face that you recognize giving their hand in telling this important tale (keep an eye out for James Spader, who is excellent).<br /><br />History. America hasn't always gotten everything right. Actually, they've gotten a lot of things wrong, but sometimes it's good to be reminded of the things it has gotten right. The 13th Amendment is one of those things, and I'm not sure many people realize just how close this country was to not passing it for many more years. It gives you a whole new appreciation for the will of a few extraordinary men and their clarity of vision to pass such an historically significant piece of legislation in the face of tremendous bigotry.<br /><br />In Short:<br /><br />Spielberg takes a part of history and makes it more. What could have been a drab exercise in the telling of the passage of a bit of legislation is instead a front row seat at one of the most important moments in US history. The whole film is shown in an almost dreamlike quality and pulls the audience into a powerful script featuring an iconic performance and generally excellent ensemble cast. I really want Abraham Lincoln to tell me another story, but sadly he's dead going on 150 years now, so instead I'll give this a 9 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who can appreciate moments of historical significance.<br /><br />Exceptions to the recommendation:<br />- anyone who would prefer to remain doomed to repeat history due to their lack of knowledge thereof;<br />- states' rights advocates who would be subject to high blood pressure from any increase in the power of the federal government;<br />- anyone who may just get confused that it's the republicans fighting on behalf of the minorities;<br />- people who were expecting to see Daniel Day-Lewis in a movie instead of Abraham Lincoln;<br />- people who are tired of the white-man-as-savior version of history;<br />- anyone who was expecting vampires or hunting thereof.

B005LAIIKI|4.0|Why you shouldn't see it:<br /><br /> If you've seen Inglourious Basterds and thought once was enough, you're not likely to find much worth reviewing here. This is another of Quentin Tarantino's fantasy revenge flicks, of the sub-genre that rails on systemic injustices.<br /><br />Beyond that, there are a number of pretty obvious reasons that will probably jump out at you right off the bat, even if you haven't seen the movie. Most of these reasons boil down to whether or not you are comfortable with confronting humanity's occasionally (or frequently, if it's the deep south in the 1850's) ugly nature. This is a movie that makes white Americans uncomfortable with being white Americans in much the same way that Basterds probably made German non-Jews uncomfortable with being German non-Jews.<br /><br />This film unabashedly displays outrageous racism and almost cartoonish violence (frequently using the high visual contrast of bright red blood spattering on bright white set pieces). Two things that, like it or not, are prevalent recurrences in the way mankind has conducted itself through the years. If you like to close your eyes, cover your ears, and sing \\"The Song That Never Ends\\" when you're confronted with either of these things, because you like to think happy thoughts about the good ways in which people treat each other, this movie is not for you, and you will likely find it a tremendous waste of your time. Unless you really like singing that particular song, I guess.<br /><br />Why you should see it:<br /><br />It should be noted, however, that the way that Django and Basterds make an individual want to check his cultural baggage at the door is wholly unrelated to the way in which movies like Amistad and Schindler's List do the same thing. While the two Spielberg movies make you take a magnifying glass to our past somewhat against your will, the two Tarantino movies are more like your charismatic buddy who comes along and says, \\"Hey, check this out.\\"<br /><br />Django takes American slavery, shines a bright light on it, and hands it a microphone so that it has the opportunity to show what it's about. In a way that possibly only Tarantino can do it, the movie takes a dark subject matter and turns it so ridiculous that the audience can't help but have fun with it. Everyone in the theater found a measure of satisfaction each and every time a slaver died, regardless of the colors involved. The movie also adds a sort of vindication for those of you who saw Basterds and would have rooted for Colonel Hans Landa if not for your disparate stances on the right of Jewish people to remain living. Pretty much the same character seems to travel back in time to strangely play a more (his name is Dr. King) or less (he's a white German) proto civil rights advocate whom you can really get behind and cheer along.<br /><br />There are a couple enjoyable moments that sort of jarringly take you out of the main thread of the story with their surprising cameos and/or humorous observations on otherwise revolting situations. I'm not necessarily a fan of Jamie Foxx or Christoph Waltz, as I find the former unmemorable and the latter both lacking in range and somewhat creepy in the one role that he has settled into. But in this movie, Foxx does a good job of taking his dynamic role and morphing the character throughout the course of his story arc, and Waltz is more fun when he's \\"on your side\\" (which, ironically, is the side that kills people like you if you're white). I will say, however, that the acting highlight of the movie for me is Leonardo DiCaprio going largely against his type of controlled and almost closed characters in other movies to boisterous and cartoonishly evil in this one.<br /><br />In Short:<br /><br />I had originally started writing this post by going on a long rant about Quentin Tarantino when I realized I hadn't really said anything about the movie itself. And maybe that's the point. Most of you already have a pretty good idea whether or not you enjoy Tarantino movies. I ended up giving this one an 8 out of 10, and I recommend it as a good watch.<br /><br />Exceptions to the recommendation:<br />- if you're someone who knows for sure that you just don't appreciate QT's work (which probably means that you just don't appreciate film and the history thereof (and may God have mercy on your soul));<br />- if you're one of those aforementioned people who sometimes struggles with harsh realities;<br />- if you're someone who sometimes struggles with revenge fantasies;<br />- if you hate seeing Quentin Tarantino try (active word) to act;<br />- if you're a white person who sometimes forgets to apply your filter and uncontrollably repeats things that you think are funny;<br />- or, by extension, if you're an impressionable young child... hold off for a bit, and I'll explain when you're older.
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|I am a fan of Richards Marx and have been since day one.  This DVD contains a nice mix of acoustic and band music.  All of the hits are here and a few songs I did not expect to hear.  The guest artists show up and actually add to the performance.  The camera work and sound are both awesome.  Richard Marx and band are both spot on.  Hugh Jackman surprised me.  I did not know he could sing like that (the more operatic piece).  The section I like is when Richard Marx performs songs that he has written for other performers.  I would recommend and have recommended this to several friends.  I do wish that the CD had more than just 12 songs.
B004UXUX7S|4.0|Pros: Let's be honest for a moment. You come to this movie for George Clooney, and if we're going to keep being honest, he's certainly worth the price of admission, suiting his best actor nomination nicely. But what may be surprising to some of you is the fact that his co-star, Shailene Woodley, does her part to keep pace with the much higher pedigreed Clooney. While other characters provide welcome comic relief and dramatic foils, Clooney's Matt and Woodley's Alex give the film a very human element with whom the viewer can't help but identify. Who would have thought we would be saying that about the first Batman with nipples (part of me feels bad for planting that thought in your head... but only part) and a chick most known for starring in modern teen soap operas?<br /><br />Aiding in the effort to get the viewers emotionally invested is a very deep immersion in the Hawaiian setting with the film's characters. From the stunning visuals to the quaint musical soundtrack to the constant bare feet, the movie brings the feel of Hawaii into the theater (well, I'm assuming this, since I've admittedly never actually been to Hawaii). In the end, you're left feeling as though you have actually experienced the events of the movie side by side with Matt and Alex.<br /><br />Cons: I know I just talked about how easy it is to identify with the main characters, but it's actually a little difficult to identify with a lawyer trust fund baby who lives in a tropical paradise and struggles with anything. *Coughfirstworldproblemscough*. Okay, so it's not quite so superficial as that, but you do still have to kick yourself every time you're reminded of the fact that, really, these people have it alright. Well, I didn't actually need to do any kicking of myself, because I was so busy enjoying the movie, but hopefully I just planted that thought into your head.<br /><br />Overall: Despite the plot revolving around a topic that traditionally makes me pretty uncomfortable, it's all actually a funny and enjoyable movie. The script made me breeze through the whole viewing, eagerly waiting to see what would happen to [us] next. On the other hand, while it is a fun to watch little movie, it isn't really all that special. Nothing about it stands out to me, and I'm pretty sure in five years I'll mostly just remember it for being nominated for best picture. But after gazing into Clooney's dark and stormy eyes, I can't help but give the movie an 8 out of 10.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This compound is a little thick and works a little more like glue than anything but it keeps that cpu cooler
B005HV6Y5W|3.0|Pros: Okay, I'm about to pitch the perfect movie to you. Seriously, there's no way you can screw up this pitch. Are you ready? Here it is: Brad Pitt and Dinosaurs. But not in the same scene. That would be ridiculous. Don't be ridiculous. No, Mr. Pitt and these dinosaurs exist millions of years apart from each other, but they're still in the same movie. The cohesiveness of the plot thread that binds them is up to you. No matter what you come up with, I'm quite confident that you will make a winner for me.<br /><br />The marketing for this film was spot on. A potential viewer could watch the trailer 100 times on loop and have the same knowledge of what happened as someone who actually saw the movie. Another potential viewer could just stare at the movie poster for two and a half hours and understand as much of the plot as I do. Okay, maybe that's a slight exaggeration. But I stress the word slight. Like, to the extreme. There's really very little embellishment there. I could talk about this movie, at length, around someone who's never seen it, and I wouldn't have to worry about ruining it for them.<br /><br />Accordingly, it really is satisfying to be able to say that I've seen it, and then talk about it in pretty much any manner I feel like. It's like I now share a special connection with the two people I watched it with, because we've all experienced something that makes very little sense. In the future, I'm confident I'll be able to make a reference to one of them that won't make any more sense to any of us than it does to anyone else, but it'll still get that knowing look in return. Maybe a smile, but more likely a scowl. Either way, it'll be special. And confusing.<br /><br />Did I mention there are dinosaurs?<br /><br />In all seriousness, Brad Pitt really must have eaten his Wheaties this year, because he does another very good job here. Portraying the great American patriarch, he sheds his generally off-color personality and goes the straight and narrow as a complex character torn between his dreams and his responsibilities. He simultaneously gives us a father figure with whom we can identify and struggle. While he's nominated for his work in Moneyball, this performance is probably more deserving of recognition, so I will gladly give that recognition here. (You're welcome, Mr. Pitt.)<br /><br />Cons: Is it possible for a movie to have so many non sequiturs that the plot itself becomes a non sequitur? Because I think that's what happened here. The thematic elements of the movie are constant, but the plot almost seems like an afterthought. What I said above about the trailer and poster giving as much clarity of vision as the movie itself was said with a completely straight face. The style of the movie is just one of images and impressions. Many of the images are actually quite evocative... In moderation. When they make up the bulk of the film, it becomes a bit much.<br /><br />I was tempted here to just start listing off some of the (many) random images shown throughout the movie (really, they're ubiquitous), but then I decided that I didn't want you to hate my blog as much as a lot of people hate this movie.<br /><br />I've mentioned previously how I feel about movies that lack dialog. The thing is, while it makes sense in a silent film, it makes very little sense in a movie that has dialog. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, \\"Blake, that didn't make any sense what you said just now.\\" Welcome to The Tree of Life. Catching a theme? The point is that, yes, there is talking, which is an excellent device for advancing any plot. The problem is that the dialog in this particular movie tends to take what plot was there and tear it up and put a match to it. Most lines evoke a thought from the viewer like, \\"Wait, why the hell did he say that?\\" and, \\"... What does that even mean?\\" and, even less eloquent, \\"Huh?\\" And then most lines in the movie are, well, absent. I think there's a stretch of a solid half hour (although it feels like it's closer to an hour) at one point where no one says anything (because, as we all know, dinosaurs can't talk).<br /><br />Overall: While I was watching the movie, if there wasn't either Brad Pitt or a dinosaur on the screen (which was about eighty percent of the movie), I was doing some combination of furrowing my brow, scratching my head, looking at the clock, and wondering when my roommate Jeff was going to say something really angry and biting. It was definitely a restless movie watching experience. Constant mental fidgeting, trying to figure out which way was up. The funny thing is that, in hindsight, I kind of appreciate it for what it was, which is a fairly spot on impressionist representation of growing up (with daddy issues), all the while questioning existence. It is a thoroughly introspective work that (either fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your perspective) doesn't really offer any answers. Just questions. I can dig it. But then I remember the extremely painful experience of actually watching the movie, and I give it a 5 out of 10 while I hope that I never have to sit through it again.

B00782O7NE|3.0|Pros: Obviously, a 1920's-style silent film is going to depend even more upon its acting than your average modern movie, as it doesn't have the benefits of advanced visual effects, sound effects, Technicolor, or, you know, dialogue to flesh out a story. That being said, this movie did a great job of casting the leads with actors who could fairly effortlessly convey emotions and thoughts merely through their facial expressions, body language, and general pantomiming. Jean Dujardin especially had a very expressive face, and the director hit a home run in casting his dog, which was, of course, adorable.<br /><br />My favorite part of the movie was probably the dream sequence, which pretty deftly sums up George's mental and emotional state. That being said, I also enjoyed viewing the film with an eye for any anachronisms within it. They were clearly trying to mimic a 1920's production, but there were some things that they did in the movie that would not have been possible in a silent film from that era. There is a fun list on IMDB of actual anachronisms in the movie, which people-with-way-too-much-time-on-their-hands have noticed and detailed. God bless IMDB.<br /><br />Cons: I know I said the acting was strong enough to carry the film in spite of the other missing elements that we have all taken for granted with modern movie making, but if I'm going to be honest... I like those other elements. A lot. Specifically the spoken dialogue part. It allows for so much more depth in a movie, and a significantly higher entertainment factor. Also, in order to properly convey emotions and thoughts in a voiceless movie, actors are forced to be pretty campy and mug at the camera a lot. I've just never been real big on that kind of overacting, which was prominent in earlier movies, also due in part to the legacy of stage acting in film.<br /><br />Overall: I appreciate the attempt to rekindle an older style of storytelling, but I'm pretty confident that there was a good reason for the advancements in moviemaking technologies, and I'm generally appreciative of the effects of science here. Now, I'm aware that the mere presence of these technologies does not mean that every movie these days (or even the majority) contains those extra layers, but luckily they're still available. While I don't regret having seen this movie, I wasn't particularly enthralled during the viewing, and I have no overwhelming interest in seeing it again. In the end, I couldn't kick the feeling that it was just one giant exercise in glad-handing the glorious history of Hollywood, so I glad-handed it a 6 out of 10.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I actually really enjoyed this book. It was simple, made you think twice and had good twists in it! It kept me anxious until the very end and it was worth it!
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Why you shouldn't see it:<br /><br />You probably heard that Les Miserables is a musical. For the uninitiated, in this case, \\"musical\\" means nary a line is spoken. All dialog, internal or otherwise, is conveyed to the audience via song (and occasional dance). So if that sort of thing bothers you, I can't imagine that you'll get much of a kick out of this. But really, you've been fairly warned. I may be alone in this, but I think having an entirely musical movie is dangerous territory to tread, because of the difficult balancing act between having catchy tunes and songs that actually advance the plot. It seems like being catchy requires a hook, and most hooks are repetitive, and repetitive things don't really progress. Aside from that, the occasional downside of the musical format is partly inaudible dialog, which in turn stunts the progression of the plot for your mind if you didn't prepare for your film/play-watching by reading the Wikipedia article.<br /><br />Speaking of which, if you do happen to peruse the Wikipedia article, you may surmise that this film is in fact based on a stage musical, which in turn was based on a novel. And not just any novel. A five part, 1500 page, 530,000 word novel that spans nearly 20 years and appears on Wikipedia's list of longest novels, right alongside the likes of War and Peace and Atlas Shrugged. In an industry that typically struggles to compress 150 page novels into two hour movies, I'm wondering what brilliant individual saw this piece that was ten times longer as a two and a half hour trip to the theater.<br /><br />Apologies in advance, as I'm well aware that Les Mis is a wildly popular stage production... I guess the above is more of a gripe with the original musical mind that saw the novel and decided to turn it into a play. From a story standpoint, the heavily downsized movie version seems disjointed to me, with the main culprits being the two times the screen just flashed the words \\"Nine years later...\\" How is this all one story? It isn't. It's five stories with common characters. Everything - namely the characters and their relations to one another - just comes across as abrupt when they change.  I'm assuming these transitions are either more gradual or are presented in a manner more sensical in the novel, but in a shortened version, they only confused me. Really, I'm trying to figure out how the play became so popular, and I'm leaning toward the music being the key.<br /><br />While the music may have been the strength for the play, it was fairly hit or miss in the movie. The play had the benefit of being sung by professional singers in a fashion that was very friendly to pretty-sounding performances. In the movie, movie stars were used for the main roles, and the stylistic choices could be boiled down to the fact that the director wanted his actors to act their scenes, not merely sing them. The result is uneven at best, with Amanda Seyfried having a pretty yet limited voice, Russell Crowe having both an awkward and a limited voice, and people like Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen not even really attempting to sing.<br /><br />Why you should see it:<br /><br />This is apparently a highly controversial point, but the main reason I would recommend anyone to see this movie is really just for the moments with Anne Hathaway, and, specifically, her rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream.\\" This was an instance where the director's desire to have his actors act really paid off in my opinion, and I couldn't avoid getting goosebumps when I saw it. Some people will point to other performances of said song as much prettier renditions, but this is a woman in complete despair... Why would she sing beautifully in this moment? Anyway, I thought that one scene alone was fantastic and deserving of Hathaway's Oscar nod (and probable win).<br /><br />Some of the other casting is also well-done, with Hugh Jackman (nominated), Samantha Barks (nominated for other awards) and Eddie Redmayne (nominated for other awards) as obvious examples. Each was able to properly portray their character with appropriate enough musical inclination to also sing their pieces well.<br /><br />Those songs happen to be, as with many things about this movie, hit or miss. Some are fun and catchy, and others appear to be mostly expository and had a harder time sticking with me, a first time viewer/listener. I also understand that the film took quite a few liberties with the original music, editing and remixing it so that it is definitely a different interpretation of the material.<br /><br />Otherwise, the production value for this movie is great. When the opening number started, I got pretty excited about the scale of it all. I'm also pretty fond of the movie poster (shown above), which did a great job at capturing my imagination with Cosette's almost haunting eyes. The strange thing about this big budget, large scale production is that the director spends a lot of time showing the audience very little other than the face of the person who is presently singing.<br /><br />In Short:<br /><br />My main complaint about Les Miserables is actually kind of strange, considering the fact that my favorite movie of the year may very well have been Cloud Atlas, but it seems like simply has too much plot to be boiled down into 2.5 hours. The only real reasons I would consider to be must-see for this particular fare would be if you're either a musical fan not familiar with the original stage production or a super fan who needs all things Les Mis. In light of that, I give it my first take-it-or-leave-it recommendation, and rated it a 6 out of 10 mostly for the efforts of Hathaway and Jackman (on whom I have a slight man crush), and the fact that having exposure to a culturally significant work such as this can do a person some good.<br /><br />Now for the awkward part. Since I gave a middle of the road recommendation, I suppose this portion needs both reasons to see and not to see the movie. Let's give it a shot. Exceptions to the recommendation:<br />- If you would if you could live your life by breaking out into seemingly random song and dance without getting funny looks, see it.<br />- If you're a Francophobe, don't see it.<br />- If you're a Francophile, see it.<br />- I could have those last two backward, since the movie title pretty well lays the groundwork for miserable French people... I guess it depends on how much you love or hate and/or identify with French people. (Random true story: after the movie, I heard one gentleman say to another: \\"I didn't know it was going to be such a sad movie.\\")<br />- So if you really hate those cheese eating surrender monkeys and enjoy watching them suffer, reverse the second and third bullet points.<br />- If the idea of all French people having English accents bothers you, don't see it.<br />- If you can appreciate a movie due to one especially powerful scene, see it.<br />- If Russell Crowe singing in one nasally note bothers you, don't see it.<br />- If you just really enjoy large scale productions, see it.<br />- If the idea of a large scale production with an inordinate number of prolonged close ups bothers you, don't see it.<br />- If you like to take in stories by just skipping over large chunks of them and inserting \\"Nine years later...\\" exposition, see it.<br />- If you think Anne Hathaway has beautiful hair, don't see it.<br />- If you've somehow seen every other best picture nominee, and this is the only feather missing from your cap, you may as well bite the bullet and see it.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Eveything was as expected. Recieved the blu ray in a timely mannor and had no issues with the discs or the process
B00A81NFAS|4.0|Why you shouldn't see it:<br /><br />I've never been to Philadelphia. I hope to change that someday, because it is a city full of history, and I personally have a healthy appreciation for history and the way in which it shapes the world in which we live and the people who we become.<br /><br />Before I confuse you, allow me to point out that Silver Linings Playbook is not a movie about history. But it is a movie set in Philadelphia. And while I've never been there, I have developed a healthy hatred for it. You may say that hatred is baseless, but I say you've never met someone from Philly. Or you're from Philly and lack proper perspective. Admittedly, nearly all of my interaction with Philadelphia and its residents has, to this point in my life, revolved around sports. But Philadelphia athletes do things like electrocute dogs (I will kindly ignore you as you point out he was an Atlanta athlete while he was electrocuting dogs, because we had the benefit of ignorance), and Philadelphia fans are widely acknowledged to be the worst in sports (unless you're from Philly... then they're awesome).<br /><br />You may be wondering why I should be suggesting that you not see a movie because it is set in a city you may or may not hate based almost solely on its relationship with sports. My response would be that Philly is a sports city, and it is defined in major part by its relationship with its sports. Accordingly, this movie, through its characterizations, very much relates to Philadelphia's relationships with its sports. So if you are like me and have a healthy distaste for Philadelphia, its people, or its sports, you may want to avoid watching this.<br /><br />Why you should see it:<br /><br />I said that Silver Linings isn't a movie about history, and that's true. Nor is it explicitly about Philadelphia. But it is a story about people who are the product of Philadelphia's history, and because of that, it couldn't be set anywhere else. Other films have settings that are merely the time and place in which the plot unfolds, but this is a plot that couldn't exist outside of its setting. The result is a story that is unique and compelling to me and yet all too familiar to many Philadelphians.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper has seemingly made a career of playing jerks in his movies, and that actually hasn't changed here. Maybe that's because he's a jerk in real life (you'll never guess the city from which he hails... Philadelphia!). Anyway, in this movie it's almost as if his jerk personality is put back in its natural environment, and the result is a jerk you can pull for. I don't necessarily think he had to stretch his acting abilities all that far to appear in this, but he still does a fantastic job of portraying a man who is wholly unlike me but still completely relatable.<br /><br />You can still get in on the ground floor of Jennifer Lawrence appreciation, since she's only been around for two years. But in those two years, she has two deserved best actress nominations (one of them here) and two roles in fan-pleasing box office genre movies. If she isn't on the fast track to becoming one of Hollywood's (much needed) leading ladies, I just don't know what to say. In Silver Linings, she plays a sort of mirror to Bradley's character, and likewise nails the jerk-for-whom-you-wish-good-things part (and yet she's from Kentucky... go figure).<br /><br />Aside from the two main characters, there are still a few other noteworthy members of the cast. It appears as though this was an opportunity jumped on by Robert DeNiro to get back to quality acting, and I have to say that I've never before been genuinely entertained by Chris Tucker until now. I won't say that they offer any sort of counterbalance or opposition to the off-kilter nature of Cooper or Lawrence, because they don't. Everyone in this film is off his or her rocker at least a little bit, and that's the point.<br /><br />In short:<br /><br />I spent the entirety of Silver Linings torn between wanting to know what happens next and still not wanting to see what happens next. The unorthodoxy of the two leads draws me in in a way that I haven't experienced in a while, and I appreciate the opportunity to care about such flawed individuals. I don't believe Cooper had to reach to play his character, but that doesn't diminish his portrayal at all, and Lawrence keeps step with him the entire time. In the end, I think nothing more than spite for the city of Philly made me leave the rating for this one at an 8 out of 10 instead of more, but I still recommend it for anyone who can enjoy a completely unusual romantic comedy. At least I think that's what it is... I don't know what other category it would fit into.<br /><br />Exceptions to the recommendation:<br />- anyone with a jealous wife or girlfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Jennifer Lawrence in this movie;<br />- anyone with a jealous husband or boyfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Bradley Cooper in this movie;<br />- if you think dancing scenes are stupid and contrived when added into romantic comedies;<br />- people who would like to go on thinking that they're the ones with problems;<br />- anyone who can't handle awkwardness fueled by inappropriate comments;<br />- if you really do have a seething hatred for the City of Brotherly Love.
B0095P29EG|4.0|Very good movie, love Chris Helmsworth and Natalie Portman.  Looking forward to the sequels, other Avenger movies. My kids loved it.
B0077ATSZE|3.0|Pros: I don't know if I've mentioned this to you, but I'm kind of a big Tom Hanks fan. In the world of cinema, I'm pretty confident that a better actor cannot be found currently or in the past. And for another one of his caliber to come along in the future would simply be super awesome. Almost like the Second Coming of Christ, but without any of the sacrilege a comparison like that might normally imply. Accordingly, I spent much of the movie hoping for Mr. Hanks to pop back up on the screen, so that I could cry some more about the fact that he was dead (that's a spoiler only if you know absolutely nothing about the movie, by the way). This wasn't necessarily Hanks' best work, but I'm not going to complain about any opportunity to see him strut his stuff on the silver screen. Especially when he's providing me with an excellent parental role model, whereby his primary function in life appeared to be blatantly lying to his son in a playful sort of \\"I'm going to fill my kid's head with so many stupid little factual inaccuracies that he's going to have a complex when he's older\\" way.<br /><br />Oskar Schell is the most eloquent child in the world. He speaks every line as though he's a thirty year old Shakespearean actor, instead of the ineffectually speaking ten year old that he ought to be. It's really important to me to be able to watch a movie and understand what it is that the characters are saying to me. That is, if there's talking at all. Some movies this year just sidestepped that problem completely. So anyway, it was nice that, quite unbelievably, a small child was able to deliver each of his lines in a manner that I could both hear and understand. In the emotionally raw reality of this movie, you have a little boy able to deliver lines in a very straight laced, non-speech-impeded, discernible manner. Wait a second...<br /><br />Cons: Oskar Schell is the most eloquent child in the world. He speaks every line as though he's a thirty year old Shakespearean actor, instead of the ineffectually speaking ten year old that he ought to be. Why in the world does he speak so clearly? It's actually kinda creepy. And eventually very much wore on my nerves. I suppose it fit his character as some sort of improperly undiagnosed Asperger's-affected boy, but that's honestly not really the kind of character with whom I'm prone to identify.<br /><br />I also couldn't identify with his motivation through the course of the movie. I've never particularly struggled with death, but that's most likely some sort of character flaw of my own, and I've also never had to go through the loss of, say, the only person in the world with whom I share some sort of bond. Or even the loss of a parent, for that matter. I'll count myself lucky on that front, obviously, and I will momentarily admit that I actually do remember \\"The Worst Day\\" and didn't find myself immune to the emotional effects of the movie.<br /><br />Overall: Anyway, when I was able to take myself out of the fairly brow-beating sentiment of the movie and think about it objectively, it didn't necessarily strike me as well done or as eloquent as the boy himself. I think most of the effect of the movie just comes from the ability of nearly every audience member being able to identify with either losing a parent or with the horrific events of 9/11 itself. Or both. And it seemed to cash in fairly ruthlessly on those two things, almost using the crying version of a laugh track, indicating to the audience when they ought to choke up. *Cue double-emotion-whammy Tom-Hanks-as-Falling-Man flashback as I, with teary eyes, give the movie a 6 out of 10.*
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how the inspector is chasing you with his dog. I play this all the time.<br /><br />  VERY GOOD GAME!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Why you shouldn't see it:<br /><br />If movies that come to a slow boil aren't likely to hold your attention, there's a chance Zero Dark Thirty won't either. It covers a time period of nearly ten years, and you feel the length of the film accordingly. Each minute wears on you as time passes by with no real headway in the search for arguably history's most wanted man, and you begin to wonder whether it was all really worth all the fuss (and time... and effort... and cost...) of watching people look for him. This movie is drama much more than it is suspense, action, or anything one could remotely consider \\"light\\" (there are moments of levity, but they are more brief breaks from the slow-mounting tension than anything genuinely comical).<br /><br />With the main characters of this movie all being CIA and military special forces, you might expect it to be an edge-of-your-seat thriller. While there are a couple moments of thrills, the vast majority is spent wondering where the thrills ran off to. Between a moderately graphic torture scene at the beginning and a raid on UBL's compound at the end, there's mostly just a lot of talking and scheming and thinking and nerve-wearing stretching of moments.<br /><br />If you prefer for your movies to present you with some sort of agenda, as though Hollywood is responsible for calibrating your own moral compass, this one might not do the trick. It presents its material in a surprisingly even-handed light, which has reportedly bothered some of the more negative-minded critics out there. Since this film features depictions of distasteful acts, in the opinion of some, it is the job of the filmmaker to make obvious her distaste for said acts instead of simply portraying the story unfiltered.<br /><br />Why you should see it:<br /><br />On the surface of it, Zero Dark Thirty is, in the mold of both Argo and Lincoln this year, an expertly told historical tale. It takes an event about which most of us know many of the details and still makes it a gripping film going experience. When I take a step back and think about it, I realize that it's pretty inappropriate for me to catch myself holding my breath while watching any movie, let alone one with an ending of which I am quite familiar. And yet, that's exactly what this movie did to me, even more so than either of its historical counterparts among this year's crop of nominees.<br /><br />I could probably talk at length about any number of things that I consider strengths of this movie. The brilliantly understated performances of every member of the cast, not least of all Jessica Chastain, which allow the film to be driven by the slow grind of the developing plot and the atmosphere it creates. The deft and even-handed treatment of the (only partially known) source material that allows the audience to draw its own conclusions regarding both the means and the end of the hunt for Bin Laden. The distinct lack of blatant Hollywood moments used to artificially amp up the suspense of each moment, which intriguingly does much more to draw the viewer into those very moments. And, not necessarily the movie itself, but - the trailer, which perfectly conveys to the viewer exactly what to expect from the movie without spoiling any of it (I seriously love this trailer, even more than I typically love trailers, which is saying a lot).<br /><br />But what I really want to talk about is something else entirely. Or, more appropriately, maybe it's the combination of all of the above that leads to something that has really stuck with me as a movie-going experience I'm not used to. Now switching to explicitly first person, since it's the only voice that really seems appropriate:<br /><br />When I was leaving the theater, I knew that I had been made to feel something, but I couldn't quite figure out what it was. Then, as I thought back through the events of the movie, I realized that I hadn't felt \\"something\\" at all. I had felt a number of things, and those feelings had corresponded exactly with Jessica Chastain's character Maya. And, by reflection, my own feelings on the UBL manhunt itself. Ranging from discomfort to resolve to determination to jadedness to exhaustion to relief, and, as the screen went black: emptiness. I had just devoted nearly three hours of my life to watching this movie - much like the characters devoted nearly ten years of their lives to catching Bin Laden, and the closing impression we were all left with was emptiness. Not the kind of emptiness that accompanies the depressed thoughts of \\"why did I just watch this movie,\\" but instead the kind of emptiness that hit Maya like a hammer when she pondered her past and wondered how that could point her to any future.<br /><br />In Short:<br /><br />To be honest, if you have seen the trailer, you should know exactly what to expect from Zero Dark Thirty (unless you're bad at watching trailers... it's not a skill everyone has). I saw in it one of the best and most evocative trailers I've ever encountered, and that's pretty much exactly the kind of movie I ended up seeing. It's subtle yet direct, clear in purpose yet uncertain in meaning. I recommend it with a 9 out of 10, because while it isn't necessarily what I enjoy about movies, it is certainly what I appreciate about them.<br /><br />Exceptions to the recommendation:<br />- if you prefer your waterboarding to be in a more private setting,<br />- people who actually enjoy the artificial, Hollywood-injected moments of suspense,<br />- anyone hoping to see Jessica Chastain boobs,<br />- if you don't have a leather recliner to sit in through nearly three hours of movie,<br />- if you would rather your media present you with one slant or another so that you don't have to risk getting lost in the uncertainty of your own self-resolved morality,<br />- if you're an Osama Bin Laden apologist.

B006LSZECO|4.0|So, with two not very likeable characters, I found myself actually rooting for one halfway through.  (I'm trying very hard not to give anything away).<br /><br />Two thirty-somethings, after having to relocate from flashy NYC to downhome Missouri, find themselves caught in the decline of their marriage.  Amy then disappears under strange circumstances and everything is pointing to Nick as the suspect.<br /><br />For all of you who really like a good sociopath story, this is one not to be missed.  I had a hard time getting into it at first because who hasn't read about dumpy marriages and crime stories that go hand in hand?  However, the author kept the story at a pretty good cadence alternating between Nick's side and Amy's &#34;side&#34;.  That's all I'm saying before I blabber all of it...

B007THA4FI|4.0|I originally wanted to read this book because I enjoyed Rowling's writing and style in her Harry Potter series, as well as the books themselves of course. However, The Casual Vacancy is quite different than her previous works and took a little to both get used to and grasp what was going on. Once I did though, I found the book compelling and hard to put down. I define the mark of a good book one that leaves me thinking about it after I have finished reading it and this certainly did. It leaves an impression of life that we sometimes like to forget about, makes us care about people we may not otherwise, and makes us understand our own humanity and that we are all flawed, but those things don't have to define us. It is definitely worth the read.
B004LWZW8S|2.0|After watching the previews for Immortals, I was expecting the film to be like the Clash of the Titans remake, but a lot gorier. With that in mind, I was not necessarily disappointed when I finally say the movie. Immortals is a simple, forgettable action flick that happens to be set in ancient Greece. With a weak, sometimes presumptuous storyline, and characters that are thrown in seemingly at random, it certainly won't win any awards for writing, nor for acting, though Henry Cavill and Mickey Rourke give convincing performances as the film's hero and villain. Visually, the movie is beautiful; the settings are epic, the CGI is very good, and all the actors and actresses are gorgeous. The action is corny, but well done. The film's style also deserves a nod; it's reminiscent of 300, but brighter and slicker. But its style can't make up for all its flaws. While watching it, I wondered if the producers chose the actors based on physical attractiveness alone. Mix in some unnecessary gore and brief nudity and you've got a film that is not really worth seeing unless it's for free.
B0063GORYU|5.0|8Just an easy relaxing game. It took a couple games for me to get the feel card manipulation but only because I'm a newer Kindle user. You'll enjoy this game.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|characters were so realistic would make a wonderful gift to any one male or female<br />young or old loved it
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love the series, and I love how the books come so fast over the Kindle. Anyone who likes fantasy stories should try this book.
B00004STPT|4.0|I rated ir 4 stars because the condition of the CD when it arrived was good, but on the inside of the CD box it was boken.<br />But the music is wonderful. And it is highly recommended for those people who love the movie.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Saw fun ob the grammys and liked them.  Ordered the CD and I love all the songs in it. Great buy!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Love playing this game. Play for hours come back the game has more money. but make town bigger need real money to upgrade. Love love city building game.<br />Love love love love
B000VWYNOG|5.0|I love anything Van Morrison does.  I've been a fan for years with songs like The Mystic and Brown Eyed Girl, but now have an appreciation for all of his work.  He really is a genious muscian.  I would recommend this and any of his albums.  You can't go wrong.
B001KWZ796|5.0|I chose this rating because the movie itself is very clear and not blurry and not glitching every five seconds. I'm able to watch movies anywhere I go now and I love it.
B006O6EOII|5.0|This doll was what my grand daughter wanted and it came quickly and it was inexpensive and she was happy.
0765325950|3.0|I don't like Sanderson's work (yes I have read at least 2 of his books) while his fantasy universes are ok, his characters are extremely simple and one sided, usually with minimal development.  I think the last couple of WOT books have suffered greatly from this, despite the fact that a little Jordan is still left in them.<br /><br />This books is actually the best of the Sanderson era because it is just a plethora of battles and no attempt at character development.  In fact I have started to dislike so many of the positive characters because of the way Sanderson portrays them that I was really happy when both (spoiler) Eugene and Gawyn.<br /><br />In any case for WOT fans the books is good enough, it finishes the saga which I have been a part of over a long time now.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This movie let me understand that they are not &#34;troubled kids.&#34; I hope all the students in our school watch this movie, so they could stop segregating people.
B00942X8PY|4.0|this is a pretty good puzzle game but i will be deleting it shortly. reason being, zen mode has no hints, so if you're stuck you're stuck and that's it. puzzle mode has those snarky comments at the end of each level, which got annoying really fast. actually, in zen mode after each level there are dumb quips which for the most part have nothing to do with zen, and i find those very annoying as well. what i DO like about this game is the sound effects. if the developer removed all the stupid comments at the end of the levels, and added a hint option in zen mode, this thing would stay on my device a bit longer.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I have only read his last 4 outings but when my reading list gets thinner, I will surely read more about Harry
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|Like.  previous poster, the game is great until the message comes up to download Dark Forest. I am stuck and can't play past it. I know it was only $.99 but I should be able to play it a bit longer than the short time I did.
0486448843|5.0|I buy everything a see of William Waterhouse, and this is a no an exception!<br />I don't know why there are not so many things (books, postcards, calendars) about this fantastic artist.....<br />Well, I love this and I will buy anything from W. Waterhouse!!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another excellent Harry Bosch story.  Enjoy the way he dogs his cases.  Waiting for the next one to be published
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Child of the 70s or 80s? Wealth of pop culture knowledge?  Then this is a great, easy and fast read appropriate for all ages.  It's so good you'll finish it in a weekend or less.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|After a long day of work and stress its nice 2 get on this game and have some mindless fun  its a good thing  :-)
B00BETX5PS|4.0|great action! sometimes difficult to understand. what can I say?  It's 007 and it kicks butt! I do highly recommend this movie!
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Sad story but well laid out and keeps one's interest going.<br />I just wanted to see it because of the actors but was pleasantly surprised.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|My children have watched it everyday since we purchased it. I am having trouble viewing in on my Kindle. Is there any recommendation you have?
B0042TV4IW|3.0|Currently into British movies so I found this Interesting and enjoyable. Will recommend to anyone with the same interest -- 3 stars
1616550414|5.0|Amazing Book. It's a mandatory item for Zelda's series collector's. I recommend this book for all fans! Very Nice. .
1609611543|5.0|Info a little heavy at times but well worth the read.  Must read for anyone with gluten intolerence.  Not just celiacs.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|I love this book. I love the studies it has. Worth the read. It is easy to follow and has a way of reminding you what has happen through out the book in a soft way.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is addicting for sure. I don't know if there is a save button though so be careful. I lost a lot of progress
B005HSL626|5.0|I like this game because it is addicting with just cutting fruit is amazing. Its fun because it is fast paced and action packed. All together it is really fun. Thanks Halfbrick Studios for this wonderful game.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was just the right mix of hidden objects and mystery. Thanks for a great game.
B0086700CM|5.0|This the first of the most addictive series for android today. It is at times high paced and you really have to think fast. It is one of the best games I have ever played period. The designers of this game are cool beyond belief.
1611761182|3.0|Unfortunately, this was an abridged version which I forgot to check.  Listened to it and then checked out the unabridged version from the library.  You'll miss a lot if you don't listen to the fuller version.  Great follow up to first volume.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This the second game of the best series known to man. It has 10x better graphics then the first and has a wider variety of things to collect and do. For example the mine shaft is a huge step up from the old game. Also the gems are another bonus to the game. You did again Imangi Studios, you did it again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this it th game ya l love the game so much cay<br />so buy this game everyone  this game is $$$$$
1594744769|5.0|When I picked up this book at our local library, I thought it looked rather scary and like something I would never read. But I decided that it was so peculiar, to give it a try! And boy am I glad that I did. This book was very well written and had a wonderful plot! It kept me interested and made me wonder what was going to happen next! I absolutely cannot wait for the sequel! I highly recommend reading this book! Even adults, like myself, can get into this book!
B00117S4GS|4.0|The first season starts off with a young Sam and Dean who watch as their mother horrifyingly bursts into flames in front of them. Traumatized by this event, and in a spirit of revenge, they carry on their father's mission to become the sheriffs of all things supernatural. The first season has the main theme of Sam and Dean trying to find their mother's killer. Each episode of the first season involves Sam and Dean fighting creatures and killers from just about every horror film you can think of, which is a cool concept. I am not a fan of recurring formulas in a show (like SVU and similar shows). I like them to have substance and good storytelling. The second season was meh, much of what I remember was the brothers whining a lot. But then the 3rd season came along...Yes! This was what I had been looking for. Sam and Dean stopped whining so much and there was a new formula to the show. Instead of killing random thriller movie villains, Sam and Dean now have to stop the world from ending and still find their mother's killer. Also, we meet Castiel, the friendly angel and part of the comic relief in the show.The show remained great until the 6th season where things just got spastic and weird. Still worth a watch though if you become a fan of the show. One thing I really liked was the dynamic of angels vs. demons. I don't recall having seen that in a show before and the way that was portrayed was really new and interesting. Definitely worth a watch!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this at night to relax and get my mind off the day.  It works great paired with a nice hot cup of tea or a double rum and coke!
B001FW58D6|5.0|This show had me at the first episode. I love the \\"science\\" factor and the characters are smartly written. The makeup is done well, and there are some very interesting hypothetical situations. Loved this a lot, worth a watch!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This is a very easy but creative game for the 18 month old granddaughter.  Great toy for her age and is very entertaining for her.
B0073PPNE8|5.0|I love romantic period pieces. Cold Mountain is definitely a beautiful film. It is set in a rural Northern town during the Civil War era. It tells the story of a young man and woman who fall in love but sadly are separated by war. The two correspond by letter and there is a parallel storytelling of events that occur in both of their journeys back to each other. There are some very sad moments and in fact, the ending is quite sad. It is still worth the watch. Also, the soundtrack is gorgeous!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The best (well, IV-VI anyway).... Enjoyed them in wonderful high def quality. Gotta love it. Really do, a lot. Hmmm.
0891419063|5.0|gets you into the feel of how this campaign went.  gives a great explaination about events and missions and activities.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm speechless, this book was downright amazing. You will love it. This is a MUST read! Absolutely Amazing.<br /><br />Love Always,<br />Mackenzie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game for you and your children. It is the greatest game for people any age.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The book is about how you survive loss and abuse - by being distant and withdrawn, without feelings, or can you learn to trust and love. The main characters are young, and the language in the novel is &#34;youngish&#34;.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book helped me a lot when I didn't know words. I love the vocabulary in Kingdom Keepers but I just don't know what they mean!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love these games! Great for spending time in airports and on long plane rides! I will definitly buy more versions!
B009PEPML4|5.0|A fine addition to the GY!BE collection I've enjoyed it as much as the other albums they have released. I would say that there is no standout tracks like on other albums, but still very good.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This weather app has everything needed to stay on top of conditions near and where my friends are, worldwide.  The accuracy is exceptional.
B000S58428|5.0|I lost my CD so I had to get a replacement.<br />Coldplay uses lovely melody with softer vocals and touching lyrics.
1616550414|5.0|Wow, wife surprised me with this for Valentines Day! I love it. We both love our games and weird collectibles. This book is HUGE in every way from thickness to length and height.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well thought out, action packed, highly readable and  very enjoyable. Excellent blend of humor, suspense and science. Don't miss this one.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|I had no idea this was going to be a B Movie Kung Fu/Karate style movie with a mix of modern music and ideas.<br /><br />Guess what? My wife and I LOVED this movie!<br /><br />LOL<br /><br />I don't know why people don't like it. I'd say it turned out to be EXACTLY what they were aiming for. It's a fun adaptation of those crazy &#34;no name&#34; martial arts movies you can find in the bowels of Amazon Prime Instant Video, or any other streaming service (of which there are many).<br /><br />We really enjoyed it. I think if you go in knowing the above now, and what it's a reference to...you'll like it. If you're snobbish about your movies, or have no clue as to why they shot or made the choices they did with the story and segments.....I'm guessing you will hate it.<br /><br />:)
B007REV4YI|5.0|Must purchase since the 50-years of Bond collection Christmas present had a spot for it already. Have not watched either the digital version or Blu-ray, but do not anticipate any issues. Nice to have a digital version for the iPad!
B000003RCY|5.0|I already love Rammstein's music, but this is probably my favorite album they ever have ever done along with Sehnsucht.
1423140605|5.0|Purchase for my grandson.  He likes the book very much.  I would recommend you make the purchase of this book.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|lets play a game loo this is a good fast pace game for all ages I like the levels and bonuses I'm addicted. And caint. Stop lol. Thanks for a good fun game
1423140591|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my 10 year old grandson.  He likes the book very much.  I would recommend you make the purchase.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|I have ordered DVD's off of the internet and the quality has not been good. This is an &#34;A&#34; number one product and I am very pleased!.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Although I was a massive Crue fan in the 80's and 90's, I never picked up a rag mag and read about their misadventures- I just cared about their music. They're rock stars, aren't they supposed to misbehave? Nikki was always my favorite, and I never could have guessed the crap he went through. Some fan, right? I'm just amazed at the way he pulled himself out of the darkness he was living in, and thankful he chose to share his story with us, his now less oblivious fans. Kudos Nikki! Great writing, and in the end, very inspirational!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A wonderful diversion... Intricate, layered, rich with an explosion of visualizations that defy the senses.  Very, very good read, and recommended.  I almost never hand out a fifth star.  This one deserved it.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I heard how great this film was directed and put together, tells a great story of a historical time period. Movie illustrates it very nice, add to your collection.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written and good paced account of one of the most important military missions of our time.  My hat is off to every SEAL who ever served.  Have read several SEAL books and this is one of the best.  Glad they are on our side!
B0072GPQNG|4.0|Great movie, director - great job! a little slow at times, but good powerful message throughout the film. Wish I would have gotten it for B-ray - but this one is great too.
B0061S073A|5.0|Perfect compliment for my son's android tablet. Only allows him to play the games we want him to play and prevents any accidental purchases by turning off WiFi when he's playing. Strongly recommend this for anyone who has kids.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I read the reviews saying this book was awful, but decided to read it anyway. The twists and turns were captivating, the characters lovable, but it did seem a little disorganized and maybe like it was rushed, like maybe the authors forgot the rules they had set a few sentences before. I will continue the series though, it was good enough for that!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I read it in one Sunday. I'm sure the movie won't be nearly as good.
B00005QGAT|5.0|The bonus tracks at the end are reason enough to buy this album even if you're not a die-hard fan. I'm not, but I do love this album deeply. It was a golden era of creativity for Michael, his brothers and his supporter/producer on this album. You'll love it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a really good game.<br />It is super fun.<br />It is a game that allows you to pick animals that you are going to help in the village.
B001JU4S44|4.0|Cruise is so much fun to watch he has so much energy and daring.He really gets into his charcter,gonna add all of the Mission movies to my collection.
0385535147|5.0|Grisham consistently delivers, and in this book he is deep in the pocket of federal indictments gone wrong.  The hero is by definition an anti-hero as he is in jail at the beginning of the novel.  Grisham uses some of his favorite extra touches to make this feel both familiar and new as his protaganist matches wits with both the &#34;good guys&#34; - FBI, US Marshalls - and some definite bad guys - drug dealers, murderers and theives.  A good satisfying story.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Not as good as the others but, not because of Renner,he was great,just not as much action as i came to expect with these movies but, the last 20 minutes or so did not disappoint it was great.
0765325950|3.0|first let me say this : i love brandon sanderson's mistborn series.<br /><br />i believe sanderson's strengths are the ability to develop a great plot, good character development, well worked out logic for sci-fi dynamics, ability to create an atmosphere, nice twists/turns/suspense.<br /><br />all these factors contribute greatly to the success of the mistborn series, which was a well thought out story which ran on an even pace.<br /><br />but if you see robert jordan, each book of the wheel of time series (the first six atleast) run at break neck speed. the wheel of time literally ran on chases - trollocs chasing tavern, aes sedai chasing rand, perinn chasing slayer, fain chasing mat etc. and jordan's primary focus is on action : galad's swordfight with the dragonsworn mob is nothing short of magic. likewise rand's fight with suroth. or rand's sword of flame fights with the trollocs. or mats fights with the gollum and perrins fights with the whitecloaks. and jordan excelled in these sequences.<br /><br />sanderson was the right choice after jordan died - to pick up the series which had literally ground to a halt - after book 7 to 11. the various plot lines in the story had to be gathered up and brought around to converge to a meaningful end. sanderson did it well in book 12 and 13. but the finale had to dominate in action - it was the last battle. sanderson simply lacks that capability to deliver on quicksilver action sequences.<br /><br />i won't say that 'a memory of light' was boring. but simply didn't live up to its potential. it could have been way better. wonder how it would have been if the corporates and jordan had not gotten greedy.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Have the first one got this one also,Stallone is one of my all time favorites.Jason has fast became a favorite,and the others in here are great lots of favs,cant go wrong with this one.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|in the book, the character azog is just mentioned in a single line once where he is killed by thorin's cousin dain.<br /><br />but in the movie, an entire adventure and rivalry and revenge story is built around azog.<br /><br />the lord of the rings was three books and so justified three movies in a trilogy. the hobbit is half the size of any book of the lord of the rings trilogy. and we are going to have three parts for it as well?
B00APUYWYA|4.0|would have liked it so much more without the puking and then no less the girl falling in it and and playing,really,kinda ruined it for me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So happy with the ending!  Great series overall, and the final book really pulls the whole story together.  Can't wait for the next movies
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Per request by my daughter, i purchased this for her birthday. So far, she loves it.. Very satisfied Dad. Thanks..
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The greatest books are not page turners. The greatest books have the reader not wanting to leave a page. This is one of those books and I'm embarrassed it took so long to get to it.<br /><br />My trust in Doris Kearns Goodwin as a historian only elevated this reading experience. Prior to this I knew about Lincoln and now I feel as if I had personally known Lincoln.<br /><br />If only I had Lincoln's skill as a writer to fully compliment this book would I truly do it justice. This will remain on my favorites list until my epilogue is written.
B007REV4T8|1.0|very disappointed that this dvd will not work properly: keeps freezing up and changing language. we tried it on 2 players.i will not buy a dvd from amazon again
0525953728|5.0|This is an awesome book.  I could not put it down.  It was well worth to read because you get it from Mark who was there and not 2nd hand info.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Just like the computer version and so fun but you can't make as much stuff. I died once with all my diamond stuff and can't find it but it is fun buy it.  Ps you can't make any thing with Redstone so don't break it if found
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really like this app its very simple and very easy to use it really helps me out and works great. plus its free so that's a plus.
0937381888|5.0|If you are a fan of hand crafted beers and ales and have always wanted to brew your own, this book is for you. It is truly a user friendly how to manual that not only give step by step instructions but also the kind of scientific detail that will delight the more experienced brewer. Whether you buy if for yourself or as a gift, you or the person who receives it will not be disappointed.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is one of the best alarm clocks I have ever owned. From the customized color features,display, multiple alarm time and snooze settings, and title options - this app has all of the feature to manage meetings, naps, and wake alarms.
0449013634|5.0|For those who are fans of Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole mysteries, this may be the best yet. If you have not listened to any of the audio versions before or even if you have, you will be mezmarized! Robin Sachs, the reader for this and the other Harry Hole books, has the voice you imagine Harry to have. Not only that but he is able to provide equally believable voices for the other characters which populate the book. Think of how well Jim Dale voiced the Harry Potter audio books and you will understand what I am saying. In this book, Harry returns to Oslo to try to clear Oleg, the son of the love of his life, who has been accused of a drug related murder. Others are out to kill Harry and eliminate Oleg as well. You will discover &#34;Violin&#34;, the latest drug to enslave Norway and corruption within the police system. Who was the realy murderer? You will not know until the very end. Is this the end of Harry Hole? You decide.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I owned this Cd in the past and I had to have it again for my collection! India Arie is a very talented singer. She is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise otherwise redundant and stale music genre. I love her soul, and the fact that she does not have to cuss or disrespect herself to share great music with the world. I hate that talented singers like her are often overlooked or downplayed for less talented singers and bimbos in the music industry! Her lyrics are so beautiful! My favorite tunes on this Cd are VIDEO..BROWN SKIN..STRENGTH COURAGE & WISDOM..BACK TO THE MIDDLE..READY FOR LOVE..ALWAYS IN MY HEAD..I SEE GOD IN YOU..SIMPLE..BEAUTIFUL..& BONUS TRACK..WONDERFUL. If you love neo soul or just good &b soul music get this asap! Its a gem from start to finish.
034580404X|5.0|I have read and reread the Fifty Shades trilogy. At first I borrowed it but then had to have my own copy. Through Christian &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; Grey and Anastasia Steele you will not only explore the steamier and perhaps kinkier side of love making but also will be drawn to their love story. All the characters in the books are well drawn and never one dementional. An interviewer asked President Obama if he knew which book was on every woman in America's bedside stand. He responded with a smile that he would have to ask his wife. If you don't have these books on your own bedside stand, don't be shy. Get your own copies.They will  excite and warm you in all the right places.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is challenging,exciting, addicting and helps pass time. It's fun to try and beat your friends. My Granddaughter got me hooked on this game. Invite your friends to play too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was an fitting ending for a wonderful exciting love story. I really enjoyed the book. It was well written.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Start at the beginning and enjoy the story. I'm not much for zombies, but I love this series. It has drama, suspense, and a great story line!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I chose this book because I had heard so much about it. It was an excellent choice and a wonderful love story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|An awesome app for reading the bible. I really like the reading plans. It is a very user friendly app anyone could navigate it easily. Great app!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I chose this book because several friends had read it. It was a wonderful easy read book. I have reread it several times.
B007VGXS8M|1.0|I got this and it says it is for the kindle edition but I am unable to download  it on my kindle so I am quite upset that I paid for something that I will not be able to use!!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is an exceptional promotion follow up for Oz! The graphics are fantastic and the music makes the game. The only downfall? I don't see my homework getting done anytime soon.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very easy to read on the tablet. The book is awesome. i recommend this read to those who may want to spice things up in the bedroom if you are not a born freak lol. But it is interesting a bit I must say keep you drawn.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great Blue Ray set, The Dark Knight Rises alone was worth the purchase.  Having all 3 is just and extra.
B00AECDDYY|1.0|I've seen only one review like mine, as to the controls not working. Can't even get past the first level as I cannot launch ships or upgrade towns, etc. This is on my new Fire 2nd gen, and we have 3. I've had apps crash my HD already and had to reload t by e operating system, so I'm now sensitive to any app not working right. This gets removed when I'm done here, as I won't risk more crashes. So,one star for wasting my money, my time, and my aspirations for an enjoyable experience. Follow up with a fix I believe in and can play... earn 5 stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is so fun and I enjoyed it so much I love my new friend<br />Fun fun fun fun fun fun
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So addicting but it is so fun to do. Also, once you get to a certain level it becomes easier to get gems...sometimes...
B00008EUMA|5.0|This is the first Megadeth Vinyl I purchased (already ordered Peace Sells and So Far... So Good... So What) and I must say, it's just amazing. The sound quality is beyond expectations, and every song from the original album is included. A collector's must-have.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is captivating to say the least. I read this in a day and could not put it down. You should read this.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like that it does what I expect. Very simple, big buttons with clumbsy fingers is great. Nice app and its free!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|When SATC  ended in 2004, I, like everyone else felt the insane need for a little more Carrie, a little more Samantha, a little more Charlotte and a little more Miranda. 2008, Michael Patrick King and the cast and crew of Sex and the City delivered a film that not only filled in the gap of four years away from our screens, they told us the story of what came next.<br /><br />The film itself is LONG, surprisingly long, and with this extended edition we're talking about an extra 10-15 minutes of unseen footage. The additional footage makes perfect sense for hardcore fans, these additional scenes are not only at times funny but they extend an offering of extra &#34;hope&#34; and sometimes &#34;explanation&#34; of scenes that were previously concluded.<br /><br />The TWO disc special edition is a perfect trade in for anyone who rushed out to purchase the film when it released in stores. On your second disc you will find an amazing conversation between show Creator Michael Patrick King and Executive producer / Star, Sarah Jessica Parker. Together they discuss everything from the process of character development - to fashion decisions with Pat Field. You will also find three additional scenes that did NOT  make it into the extended cut of the film which are alternate takes on what you DID see make the final cut.<br /><br />Overall I rated this product ***** stars because it is a collector's DREAM to carry this film as a personal memento of appreciation, fandom and hope. Without plot give away - I will simply say this .... Once you find love, and once you think you've settled your dreams, does the &#34;dream&#34; always amount to reality? and when challenges arise in our personal lives, are we truly willing to accept what has been handed to us through circumstance, choice and history?.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|Ex-frontman Layne Staley was cut down in the prime of life, passing away at the ripe old age of 34 back in the year 2002, but the remaining members of Alice In Chains eventually pressed-on without him, releasing their fourth studio album, \\"Black Gives Way To Blue,\\" in 2009. It was their first album in fourteen whole, excruciating years, and the first on a new record label (Virgin/EMI), and with a new producer (Nick Raskulinecz). And in Staley's spot is new lead vocalist William DuVall, and co-lead singer Jerry Cantrell (who has been with the band since their inception all the way back in 1990). Together the vocal duo does an overall excellent -- if not perfect -- job at filling in for Layne's now vacant shoes.<br /><br />But you, no doubt, already knew all that. What should come as an almost complete surprise, though, is the sound and style of the new album. Brutal and breathtaking, \\"Black...\\" is both AIC's heaviest and most experimental effort to date. It shuffles back and forth between no-holds-barred, headbanging doom metal and melodic, involved prog rock. And only occasionally does it re-venture back into the grungy sound of old.<br /><br />\\"All Secrets Known\\" is a terrifically dreamy, moaning, and progressive intro track with calm, distant, almost operatic-sounding backing clean vocals and other minor-key melodies. As such, it is made into a very atmospheric, somber, and faintly docile opening mood enhancer. But immediately following this comes \\"Check My Brain,\\" a piece of almost pure doom metal with crunchy, meaty, repetitively lumbering, Black Sabbath-esque riffing and a thundering groove that even hints at some Meshuggah stuff. Some catchy vocals and random guitar shredding are also slipped into the background for good measure. Splitting the difference between these two above-described tracks is \\"Last Of My Kind\\" which begins with a trippy intro before slamming into a mean, meaty, muscularly churning riff iced with catchy, robotic-sounding vocals. And later on in the song, it uncorks a surprisingly loud and chaotic, shredding solo, and some whammy-bar-inflected lead work.<br /><br />Moving on down the line, \\"Your Decision\\" is a nice acoustic strummer with a solid, flowing, melodically humming bass groove, and a deliciously melodic, jazzy-sounding guitar solo. And the use of hooky, crooned vocals and really memorable lyrics make \\"Your Decision\\" practically scream out to become a hit single. This tune, however, is offset by the record's lead single, \\"A Looking In View,\\" which seems really thunderous, aggressive, and even brutal -- especially when compared to the song that preceded it. It lunges out of the speakers with a huge, nasty, doom-soaked riff slice that recalls the glory days of Sabbath, UFO, Ozzy Osbourne, and Deep Purple. And with a booming, bottom-heavy bottom-end added to the mix, the end result is a very, distinctly metallic number, and one that evokes some Neurosis and Sleep songs, thus making it quite possibly the heaviest moment to be found anywhere on this record.<br /><br />But then comes another down-tempo and subtly restrained jam in \\"When The Sun Rose Again,\\" which boasts a sweetly prog-ish, mildly-mannered acoustic guitar lead. It is also complete with nearly funky-sounding hand percussion, clean and kind of jazzy vocals, and a Southern rock-derived guitar solo. Back on the heavy side, though, is \\"Acid Bubble,\\" which comes next. An ominously dense and pounding, Tony Iommi-stylized grinding main riff comprises this song's backbone. It is a fairly simplistic, but nevertheless effective and memorable riff, and one that is accompanied by good, soaring vocals, and a strong, humming bass line. Then, a while later, \\"Acid Bubble\\" eventually grinds down to an ominous plod, before uncorking a lovely melodic solo section. But this nearly-seven-minute-long epic again returns to the same type of heavy, throbbing riff that was heard at its beginning, and is anchored by a flowing, grumbling bass bottom.<br /><br />\\"Lesson Learned\\" is another good, up-tempo hard rocker iced with soaring, exceptionally melodic singing and an equally-as-tasty and soaring melodic solo. Next up, \\"Take Her Out\\" is propelled forward by a great, muscular bass line; but the rest of the band is also of note in this song, too. See, the guitarists are heard trading-off some really great and epic soloing while Cantrell does his best Layne Staley impression, echoing the former frontman almost to the tee. \\"Private Hell,\\" then, is a really subdued, laid-back, restrained, and involved number, and one that boasts another beautiful melodic string arrangement alongside some majestic keyboard flourishes. And it is all capped off by an epic, wailing guitar solo, and some really huge and open choruses (with catchy, sing-songy vocals). The album then concludes with its titular song, which proceeds in a manner similar to that described above, as another somber and really atmospheric piece of mood enhancement with gobs of sweet guitar harmonies and dreamy keyboard runs. (Heck, it even branches off into a cool, angelic-sounding piano solo, there for a while.) And, of course, the closer does not forget to include plenty of warm and accomplished clean singing, too.<br /><br />Although \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" fails to match the brilliance achieved on such predecessors as Alice In Chains' self-titled affair, \\"Dirt,\\" and/or \\"Jar Of Flies,\\" when taken on its own terms, it is an excellent album through and through. Furthermore, it is also definitely one of the highlights of 2009, as it is easily the best comeback not only of that year, but also of the decade. It is an album that is more-than-worthy of ample praise, which it, fortunately, has already received. Welcome back, boys; you have been sorely missed.>\\"Lesson Learned\\" is another good, up-tempo hard rocker iced with soaring, exceptionally melodic singing and an equally-as-tasty and soaring melodic solo.

B005LAIIJY|4.0|Quentin Tarantino's “Django Unchained” starts as Dr. King Schultz (Oscar-winning Christoph Waltz), a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter, “frees” a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) in a very bloody way. Then the doctor and Django form a bounty-hunting duo, and plan to rescue Django’s wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a sadistic plantation owner Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).<br /><br />The 165-minute film is overlong and the story does not really convince, but Tarantino’s new film benefits from the strong performances from the leads. As in the director’s previous film, Christoph Waltz dominates the film’s earlier part, but as the film progresses, the focus shifts slowly from his character to Jamie Foxx’s Django transforming into a deadly gunslinger.<br /><br />The name of “Django” is something familiar to fans of so-called spaghetti westerns including the 1966 movie “Django” directed by Sergio Corbucci and starring Franco Nero (who briefly appears in “Unchained”). More recently Tarantino himself appeared in a Japanese western movie “Sukiyaki Western Django.” All these trivia facts (and many other references to other films) may prove cineaste and filmmaker Tarantino’s love of the genre, though I wish he could have spent more time in fleshing out Kerry Washington’s character.<br /><br />Though the film is not as revolutionary as the same director’s trend-setting &#34;Pulp Fiction,” Quentin Tarantino's blood-soaked new film is entertaining.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Shipped quickly and in perfect condition.  Exciting movie from beginning to end!  Just what you'd expect from Marvel Comics.  The 3-D movie was as clear of a picture as I've ever seen in any movie theature.  Great graphics and special effects.  I can't wait until Iron Man 3!
B000VPUIA6|4.0|I'm glad I was able to get this for a lot cheaper than it was originally listed for, but I probably still paid too much for it.  The bonus materials & packaging included are nice, but don't blow me away.  The feature that actually holds the discs in the box is a piece of foam held on with (not very strong) double sided tape.  The movie itself is re-mastered & cleaned up well, but I think you can get just that separately.  The bonus material on the disc is interesting enough, but again at this price, I'd expect a little more...
B0002G2B2M|4.0|The DVD was slightly scratched, but the box was in good condition and the movie played through fine without skipping!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor is amazing and good at staying current with her music. Trouble is one of my favorite songs because it had that &#34;dub-step&#34; feel. She never disappoints! Great CD!

B007Q1GJA6|5.0|I have this on DVD and love it so much I have been looking for it on Blu-Ray.  First attempt of getting this movie failed when I tried to get it fulfilled by a seller that did not go through Amazon.  After full refund I awaited till Amazon had it back in stock for them to fulfill.  With as hard to find as this is, only get it if fulfilled by Amazon.<br /><br />Plays well in a LG Blu-Ray player in the U.S. no region code issues.  Not sure if it really has been optimized for high deff or not, but I think it looks better than the DVD I had of it.

B000MV8AE0|5.0|I loved everything about this movie. I'm not sure how accurate to Beethoven's character Ed Harris was, but It make me want to believe that he was like this. His passion for music in general. That it was &#34;God given&#34; to him was very inspiring.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John and Kate at their best.  Lots of great insight into Yemen and what is going on there.  Typical of DeMille, could not put it away until the end.  Good one!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Anyone who is in to firearms or has been for a long time will notice some of the short comings. Nonetheless, I still enjoy the show and it is one of the few I watch. Very well written. So well, in fact, that I never feel like the episode is long enough and I am eagerly awaiting the next.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I bought this for my daughter's kindle and she watched it on our roadtrip (4+ hours)...  All I heard was laughter coming from behind me.. She is 9 and she is loving this movie..
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Good story, but lousy execution. Another writer who's hit the mass market, and is counting on his name to sell books. He's shown he's capable of much more, yet turns out junk like this. I don't blame him. He's figured the money game out. Get a good screenwriter and make a movie. It would definitely be better than the book.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|This was a surprise and was a good overall movie.  If you are bored on an evening and not sure what to do this will make it for a fun, relaxing evening.

B00BOL3M86|5.0|This is one of my favorite made for TV series, my wife and I cannot get enough of this series and we are looking forward to the next show. If you enjoy The Walking Dead you should also check out Justified along with Lillyhammer and last but not least Sons Of Anarchy.

B008JFUNAU|3.0|Sam Raimi’s often visually dazzling prequel to 1939’s beloved classic will never replace it in the hearts of movie lovers.  But this journey that tells how the Wizard found his way to the Emerald City almost works on its own terms.  Cobbled together from elements of author L. Frank Baum’s 10 Oz books, team Disney and Raimi have cleverly avoided copyright and legal issues and delivered a bright, beautifully rendered 3D experience that brings to life a vivid dream world.  Even if you’ve never seen the other movie, this film can be a satisfying experience.<br /><br />James Franco is the carnival magician and con man that flees Kansas in a hot air balloon and is whisked by a tornado to OZ where all the denizens are under the control of a wicked witch.  The people of OZ welcome him as the prophesied savior.  He tries to explain their misunderstanding, but is smitten by beautiful witch Theodara (Mila Kunis) and when he sees all the treasure for the taking, he goes along with the unintentional deception.  The big question is: Will Oz have the guts to become the leader the good citizens of Oz deserve?<br /><br />For me, this eye-candy wavered between moments of genuine awe and wonder and yet I was sometimes taken out of the movie with thoughts of crass exploitation and a studio hoping to cash in on a familiar name.  Not sure why.  Sure, all movies are a business enterprise, but we should never think it when enjoying the story.  I believe Sam Raimi’s love of cinema is genuine and deep.  He would be making movies even if no one paid him.  Thankfully, that shows though most of the time and makes this big budget, lavish production worth seeing.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I use this on my kindle and my Samsung S3. Updates from the hotmail server pretty fast and easy to work with multiple hotmail accounts with.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|So good if you don't order it here you'll be elbowing your nearest wal mart representative asking &#34;WHERE IS IT?&#34; repeatedly, hitting him before he can even answer, because that's the best interrogation technique of all.<br /><br />Great move that looks great. Love the series, and Christian Bale is amazing. That is all.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, its a kids movie that adults can enjoy as well. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes pixar movies.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I don't know how I went so long without reading this series.<br /><br />I picked this up after seeing the HBO show first season. I was surprised at how much the books follow the series, down to exact lines read from the books. Minus hair colors. Hair colors are way off in the show.<br /><br />The book has everything, and part of what keeps you reading is how much the bad guys win throughout the series. It's so frustrating, but all the sweeter when a good guy comes out the victor.<br /><br />By the end of book 5 my most anticipated characters to read about are Arya Stark and Daenerys.<br /><br />Two amazing characters who probably evolved the most throughout the series, and I can't wait to see them shine. Especially Arya.<br /><br />Good job Mr. Martin I look forward to book 6.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I love the expendables and it does it's job as an 80's throwback movie. Lot's of action, explosions and shooting (and knife throwing). WOO!

B0013F1D02|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. When I first saw it, I was at a friends house and was blown away at how good it was. How can you go wrong when you have Robert DeNiro as a gay pirate lol
B00AE4OGCU|4.0|I found the 3 novels gripping and exciting because I couldn't forsee what was going to happen next. It is unpredictable and hard to put down. I usually get to a third novel and am able to guess what will happen next. Not so this time. I would recommend this book for any one who enjoys a really good story which is a little over the top but not silly.
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|I used to love this movie as a kid, so I decided to get it on blu ray and watch it again. I still think it's a great movie
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I bought this album on the day that Amazon was offering it for $1.99 and I can't stop listening to it. It is a very addictive CD and there is no doubt in my mind that Bruno is an extremely talented artist. His sound on this album is different and yet familiar. I can hear the influences of people like The Police, Michael Jackson, and Bob Marley. Super awesome CD.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I know linkin park has changed their style of music over the years, but I still enjoy this album for what it is. It's got some great songs along with good filler.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|It was entertaining and exciting.  I the new born experience gives us something to look forward to in the future.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works perfectly just like on any smartphone. Recommended for anyone who uses facebook and has a Kindle Fire HD as well.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|it showed how the power of untruth can destroy ones life and damage relationships.  I love Denzel Washington.  peace out
1449410243|5.0|I really liked this book, but I was hoping that it had more in it than mostly cat jokes. Regardless, The Oatmeal is awesome and I'd buy any of his books anyways.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Can't set the alarm volume.... it won't save and is always stuck on mute. No help from developer. Would like a refund
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I use it to update my shop's twitter account with. It's really well laid out, but I still have my doubts about twitter itself.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love the Ellen show and watch it every day.  She is such a kind and wonderful person.  I found her book just a little too much tungue- in-cheek
B004ULEEY8|4.0|I watched this in theaters and loved it. It's full of action (the acting is pretty good as well) and is an overall well made movie.
B0051OZ564|2.0|The acting was bad. The story was bad. Especially the ending made no sense.The only thing that was just ok, was the CG. Wait till it is free on other services.
B000W9DSVW|5.0|I bought this box set because I love all of the oceans movies (12 wasn't as good as 11 or 13, but I still liked it).
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book with twist and turns and shocking moments. Catching fire right now is the best book out of the hunger games series. Looking forward to reading the final book of the hunger games
B00006JU7T|5.0|I'm currently in the process of researching a police procedural I intend to write involving an ace NYPD homicide detective investigating a fiendish serial murderer. I figured a leisurely way to do research and get a feel for the NYPD Detective bureau would be to pop in some police docudramas. Although the events related in this drama took place some forty some odd years ago the reforms implemented in policing because of Detective Frank Serpico were profound, systematic and are felt to the present day. Are there bad apples 'Yes,' in today's NYPD of nearly 35,000. cops rest assured there are bad apples but the 'pad,' no longer exists. Corruption is no longer systematic.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Though front-loaded with all the terrific white-knuckle airplane action used in the trailers, the remainder of this lengthy character study allows Denzel Washington to display his considerable acting chops. Divorced and estranged from his teenage son, he is a man at loose ends and an alcoholic in denial, drinking the night before and during the flight he manages to save over a hundred lives by crash-landing a crippled commercial jet. This is a spectacular sequence in which two passengers and two crew members die. The investigation is leaning toward blaming it on pilot error instead of a faulty aircraft. John Goodman does an outstanding performance as a quirky high-dollar drug dealer. Kelly Reilly is a young addict the pilot meets while recovering in the hospital and later stays with him to keep him him sober. Can he stay sober to present a heroic image to the Federal investigators at the climactic hearing? Thereby hangs a tale. But be warned, this is not light film-fare, but a gritty tour de force for the star.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very entertaining and engaging.  The characters feel real and you can't help but love them, hate them, feel empathy for them, regardless you develop an emotional attachment to them.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I probably would not pay $1.99 for this app, but I got it for free. For free, it's a worthwhile app. I think it has helped me sleep at times. The only sounds that we find good for sleeping are the rain/storm sounds and the ocean waves sound. The purple noise sound is pretty good as well. I guess if it gives you a few good nights sleep, $1.99 may be worth the price. I just wasn't blown away by this product.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|It was a gift for my girlfriend, and she loves it! Very funny and does exactly the same sound, and light.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was great! When I watched the add for the movie, I wanted to watch it, but then I seen that it was based off this book, so like always I read the book before I watch the movie. I suggest you read the books before you watch the movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So hard to put down. So difficult to reach the end. Brilliantly written. Totally enjoyable read. You'll continue to live and breathe the characters of this amazing finale of a truly wonderful series.

B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Right at the outset let me get this out of the way immediately -- I LOVE Daniel Craig as Bond.  He is the quintessential Bond (and the only other Bond portrayer I like is Mr Sean Connery).<br /><br />This 3 star rating is not due to Daniel Craig whatsoever; i give him 5 stars.  The 3 stars are due to the script itself.<br />Now then to the movie.<br /><br />There were several points throughout this thing that made me sit in disbelief that Mr Bond, the trained and super efficient killing machine hesitated to finish off Silva.  Yes, hesitated.  For that matter, why was there ever a reason to bring him face to face with M?  Is there any Bond movie that justified having to bring the baddie face to face with the good guys?  And at the opening scenes on the train top in Turkey another agent hesitated.  What the heck?  Aren’t these agents “in the field” trained to dispatch efficiently, relentlessly, and without pause until the deed is done, regardless of other agents being “down”?  And to do so without question and without thinking twice?  Especially if the villain(s) is right there in your sights already or freaking even closer??<br /><br />Next, as another reviewer already mentioned, why is this list out in the open and in need of being physically chased down?  In the older espionage genre I can accept the possibility that information is placed onto a disc, or tape, or heck microfilm and it had to be handed off.  But for that to be plausible in this technologically advanced era, exposition at the beginning would be crucial to show *why* this list is in need of being chased down and recovered.  Such as why is this laptop with such information in Turkey to begin with?  Because the first thing that came to my mind is, why couldn’t said list have been sent electronically via an encrypted code to pretty much anywhere in the world?  The type of complex code that Q has to unlock at some point anyway?  And hey everyone has camera phones these days – so they couldnt take a photo of the list onscreen with a camera phone and just email it?  Or text it?  Seriously.  Show me why and how this plot came to be so that I can then accept it and suspend my disbelief for the movie’s duration.<br /><br />Q provides you a spiffy pistol.  Why did you not retrieve it when the dragons ran the other way?  Nonsense.<br /><br />And so you have Silva in custody.  We are just to accept that he was able to escape his holding cell at a super top security holding facility?  I didn’t see any cameras to monitor him so it is a big stretch to accept that he just waltzed out.  If insiders let him out, why not show it?<br /><br />And now off to Scotland for the standoff.  Why go it alone?  When Mallory okays it he pretty much says do what you need to do, but on the sly.  This translates to the ability to use some secret and highly trained Special Forces and weapons at the minimum to take with you.  Or send along after you.  Covertly.  This is M for chrissake!!  I don’t get it.<br /><br />So a 3 star is what this Bond installment earns, in my book.  I did like a few things.<br />1) Daniel Craig<br />2) Though the plot was weak, the acting as good<br />3) That Land Rover Defender in the opening chase is pretty awesome.  And there is that gorgeous Aston Martin.  ;o)

141659521X|5.0|We try to keep up with V. Flynn's books - he doesn't disappoint.  a gripping story and extension on a series of stories.  Flynn truly is a gifted storyteller!
B002RI9UBS|4.0|I initially loved this book til about halfway through.  It got boring very quickly I'm afraid.  The idea / concept is a very interesting one but I found it a bit of overkill.  I'm not sure what age group it's aimed at, at times it felt very childish but then parts of it were quite adult themed.  I have to admit that by the end, I didnt really care what the story was.  It was a very disappointing finale and I felt robbed in a way.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|No wonder it has so many challenges!!  No one wants to admit that growing up really is awful.  It was funny, touching, painful, truthful.  This is the kind of book that makes one relate to life
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed this premise. Good story line. The graphics are high caliber. That seems to be a standard of this company. It's safe for many ages. It's simple to follow. Once again my only real complaint against this group is I wish their games were more affordable.$5 a game is a lot. It doesn't take long to be in deep.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was surprising and very captivating.  A true love story with a haunting twist.  Kept me wanting to read more.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I've come to expect good quality products from this company. This game doesn't disappoint. The plot line is interesting, the graphics are high caliber, the tasks are easy to follow. Once again my only real complaint is that these are expensive. $5/a game is steep. Perhaps, G5 could offer a buy one get a second half off? Or some other discount program.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Everyone should read this book, I have read and 're-read since high school. Simply exquisite. Some say this book is over-rated; I don't see how that is possible.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A fantastic work of fiction with thrilling twists and turns throughout the novel. Great read for any fan of fiction.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run right at the first time I tried. The game is a challenge that you have to try to get over it. Especially the scene always changes every time I play. Awesome!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book one of my favorite from Nicholas sparks cannot wait to see the movie hope it is as good as the book
B007SGM084|1.0|Had heard it was such a good book and an erotica. Well it took me a year to read the trilogy. It was such a boring read I would put it down and read other books. It had a good story line but just no pizaz for me. Not compared to some other authors. Like Laurel Hamilton , Sheralin Kenyon or Christian Frehan. It was kind of vanilla for me!!!!!!

1400067936|2.0|Bradley Swope correctly (IMHO) wrote: &#34; On the plus side Taleb aggressively addresses a topic that many readers will be interested in - randomness in our daily lives. He discusses many important concepts that are not known or at least not very well understood by the general public and experts alike. These include: 1) that uncertainty and luck play a large role in the outcomes of human activities (much more than most people think); 2) that a correlation between two types of events does not necessarily mean that one causes the other; 3) that statistics and the rare random event are poorly understood by almost everyone; 4) that small differences in performance and ability can cause very large differences in the rewards or difficulties that people obtain in life; and 5) that humans are very irrational beings and are not very good at thinking probabilistically and understanding the probabilities of even everyday events rationally.&#34;<br /><br />All five of those topics are much better and more deeply covered by books and a large number of academic publications by people far more qualified than Taleb. They are also covered by a small number of easily understood lay-oriented books and articles in print and on the Web. This book is another of the latter sources on those five topics.<br /><br />However, Taleb's exposition on those five topics is embedded in the context, and his personal opinions, of financial trading. The material on the five topics is not easily filtered out for use by people who do not have an interest in financial trading. Those people should avoid the time, effort, and cost of using this book, and instead rely on the lay-oriented experts in those five topics.<br /><br />Moreover, as other reviewers have noted, the book is saturated with Taleb's arrogant self-promotion and denigration of other people. Readers who can ignore, or even enjoy, that -- and especially those who have a strong interest in financial trading, and have no education on the fiveimportant topics listed in my first paragraph -- may find this book to their liking.

030758836X|3.0|This book from the very begining had me hooked. It had me liking Amy in the begining and wondering what was Nick's problem. Then I find myself not liking Amy and I am totally Team Nick! At the end I dislike them both. If there was ever a book that will take you on a roller coaster ride and then at the end of the ride fling you off and let you land face first on the concrete... its this one.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|The most original feature animation since Toy Story. With plenty of 80's and 90's video game references this will amuse adult audience as well as that of the younger minds.

B00992CF6W|2.0|I really dislike this game I Mean its on kindle but there's no excuse many other clones have come closer to minecraft than this Its fun but if I knew that the clones were much better I would have saved the 5 dollars get survival craft instead [[ASIN:B009ZKSPDK Survivalcraft]]
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was a great book, you were guessing the whole time and she always had a way of stringing you along at the end of a chapter and making you want more. I have already recommended it to a friend.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I enjoy the game a lot but if you have played pc version before then you might be disappointed by the incredibly small map. It's literally impossible to misplace something since you can scan the map in 5 min. Another thing is the lack of a bucket, can't use flint and steel to set fire,,no boat,minecraft, or half the things pc has. I'm ready to take the hate...
0062014536|2.0|I loved the first book, the second was alright. Requiem was the biggest let down.  I was bored.  And the ending was awful. I kept trying to find the pages I was sure I skipped over. I was so looking forward to reading this.
030746363X|5.0|This book has been truly invaluable for me re: how I eat and how I approach my workouts, etc. I've only had the book for month or so and I'm already seeing and feeling results.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I've bought many external batteries over the course of my iPhone ownership (3GS, 4 and 5), as I could easily expend my entire battery in a day's time. I consider myself to be a \\"serial iPhone charger,\\" charging up whenever or wherever possible.<br /><br />This Anker Astro 2 (Updated Version) 8400mAh charger has a great shape, build quality and an optimal size and capacity for my charging across daily or distance traveling. It doesn't look or feel cheap. To me, the best part is that you use a standard USB-to-iPhone cable (including the Lightning Cable for the iPhone 5 and the earlier cables for earlier iPhones), so you can easily and securely charge the phone while you use the phone, or stash the phone and Anker in a bag for charging in the go, or stash them in a locker to charge. You often can't do this with the majority of other external batteries that attach directly to the phone, making it unwieldy and I think, unsafe for the iPhone contact chip when the iPhone is jostled about in usage or in transit.<br /><br />The 2 amp power port charges an iPhone very quickly and I estimate that the charger carries enough juice to fully charge an iPhone twice.<br /><br />The only negative is the short cable provided to charge the charger itself, but this is a minor concern.<br /><br />For a frequent, power-depleting iPhone user that has only had bad experiences with external battery options, I think the Anker 8400 is the best value and provides a power iPhone user exactly what is needed. Highly recommended.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|App is easy and fun to use. Love the widget. Really appreciate the notifications and the option to turn them off.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|While this book wasn't bad it wasn't all that I was expecting. I guess too many people hyped it up that I'm a little disappointed with the book. Not a bad book overall.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The quality of the streamed video was perfect with no interruptions. Anyone who likes Maggie Smith loves this series and there are A LOT of us).
B004TI5N38|5.0|Reacher, eat your heart out.  The character named Puller is just terrific. When the movie comes out, please don't have Tom Cruse play the part.  I liked puller as the character..He does not live out of a suitcase.  Enjoy.
B00008EY9G|4.0|That's one of the repeated lines from this movie.<br /><br />This must be the greatest overlooked horror movie of all time.  I've seen this twice now, and both times I was fascinated.<br /><br />The entire thing takes place in a violent downpour.  I kept wondering how Hollywood creates so much constant drenching rain throughout an entire movie.<br />This made the entire thing extremely creepy and atmospheric.<br /><br />More and more, we realize things are very strange indeed in this movie, set in a spooky old motel in the middle of the desert.  I won't give away the plot for those who haven't seen it, but if you love creepy movies you must see this.<br /><br />John Cusack was his usual outstanding self, and the entire cast was excellent. The direction was also good.  I can't say anything bad about this movie, and it almost got five stars from me.  I reminded myself it's not of the caliber of a movie like Psycho, therefore only four stars.  And yet, there are plenty of moments in this where it almost is up there with the great ones.<br /><br />The surprise ending is fantastic, for the viewer who loves psychological horror.  Extreme madness creates some very realistic scenarios and this shows just how real fantasies can become in the mind of someone truely unhinged.<br /><br />For the horror connoiseur, this movie is a must see.  There is some gore but not a lot.  And the first version I saw was much gorier than the version I just saw tonight.  Scenes had been cut for some reason.<br /><br />Why can't the characters get out of that place?  Why doesn't it ever stop raining?  Why do people keep disappearing?  The questions keep going unanswered in this, until the end, when it all comes together in the most horrific way possible, from a psychiatric standpoint.<br /><br />I suggest you get some popcorn and watch this for a chilling, creepy, strange good time.  This is a pretty great horror flick.
030758836X|3.0|Maybe I'm not sophisticated enough for this book, but it left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  All the characters in the book are so disturbing and their relationships are dysfunctional.<br /><br />The first half of the book was a little ho hum.  I guess it's to be expected since it needs to set the groundwork for the characters.  The second half was definitely engrossing.<br /><br />Not quite my cup of tea.
B004WR125O|5.0|Great signal strength, even though we have it down on the floor inside a cabinet and our wireless router is two rooms away.
0865479186|5.0|This is one inspiring book that has definitely influenced my thinking a lot. It is an engaging read and makes science and its 'scientific studies' accessible to all. I also found it very empowering as it helped me take my decisions in my own hands, instead of following the crowd, advertisements, or 'experts say that' blogs or news articles.<br />I am a scientist myself, but I still find this book worth each second I spent on it. (I am sure I will read it again many times over!) Ben Goldacre is doing a great service to humanity and science by checking on the bad science.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who cares about sense and sensibility in their day to day life + 'science' news that effect public spending, opinions, and behaviour.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|An intriguing read. Written very factually with no apparent axe to grind other than what to do with this series of events. Not well written but that does not take away from the rather incredible tale he has to tell. Really got me thinking. I like his concept that consciousness is not a function of the physical brain and its working

B009GQ57ES|3.0|totally worth buying just to get all the tracks you get for the price. plus i love the bonus video :) but i don't love every track on the album.
B004BCNVOA|5.0|great music for any occasion,  if your down, happy, sad, angry, pump up, exited, this would be the album to purchase
B008IEFJAQ|5.0|totally would recommend! buy it now. don't second guess yourself. DO IT NOW. :D SO GOOD. SO. FREAKIN. GOOD. YES.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|The book has a fantastic story proper of the author Phillip K. Dick. it keeps you entertained since the first chapter.
B005FFW46S|4.0|Which means it only begins to pay off when you're nearly 200 pages in, so expect some personal investment. As a long time lover of Discword, I found it an uphill battle getting through the first half the book, terribly worried I would be disappointed by the end of it. I have to agree with another reviewer that the characters seemed very foreign to me, I suppose to show how much time has passed and how things have changed. Pratchett took the ever-so-scenic route to get to the actual plot. The halfway point is very important to keep in mind because, once the story began to unfold, I found Snuff to not only be quite an enjoyable read but also very moving.<br /><br />For what it's worth, the book was good, just be sure to suck it up and get through the first half, the rest will be worth it.
B007MG360G|1.0|I just bought this app. Every time I try to play the game it  stops about 5 seconds in. I have a Kindle Fire and most games work well on my system. Do not buy!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very well put-together.  This documentary is informative, accurate, and gives a tremendous amount of useful information.  Everybody should watch this documentary because it gives a tremendous amount of incite to consumers.
B000ZMVAXO|4.0|Just one! But it's great! LOL! This thing can do one sound I like really well!  It would be nice if it could do more. Maybe a clean or semi-clean that sounded good. But, I guess they have a different one for that.  Even though I may have to buy a few of these, it sounds MUCH better than other headphone amps I have tried. But just for the one sound! Lol! Still have to recommend it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|i love spider solitaire and this is a good one! i would really recommend this app to my friends and family
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Found this movie to be quite good ... could have done without the opening scene (don't think I'm a prude, but may be) as it really added little to the rest of the movie, in my opinion.  The quality of the DVD was good and shipped to me right away ... so recommend.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It helps alot with school work. It also syncs with other devices without using a manual device sync. I just love it!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Good for adults or kids, in my opinion (which can occasionally be a bit juvenile, admittedly). A solid story, and good for the family. No overly scary bits, and some decent twists that may surprise even a jaded cynic.
1423151054|5.0|I got this set for my boyfriend this year for Valentine's Day, and he LOVES it. He's pursuing a career in character animation, and I believe that any aspiring animator should be fully aware of the work of the Nine Old Men featured in this set. The books are great quality, and the set is a fantastic gift for those who love animation.
B008P3SPVU|4.0|i HAVE THIS ON DVD.. TIMO AND KENYON ARE MY FAVS and sam jackson.... well he's sam jackson.. oh and lets not forget worm
0061537969|5.0|One of the best books i have ever read. The story is told by a dog named Enzo. The owners wife is deceased and he is facing a custody battle over his daughter. Amazing read and attention grabbing. You never want to put it down.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|exciting, and edge of the seat viewing. very believeable and militarally correct.highly recommend with a large glass of pepsi and a big bag of chips so you don't have to get up during the movie
B00AREIAI8|5.0|entertaining but can suck you into spending money. the jumping horses for completion is good but you cant really watch it because you have to pay attension to the bar.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I am in my late 30's and I found the naive &#34;young love&#34; too much for me. The subject and story wasn't enough to keep me interested, I had to speed read and skip paragraphs to make it to the ending. It was very 'Twilight' in parts, damsel in distress, the guy comes and climbs into her window and holds her until she falls asleep... it's probably great young adult reading, just wasn't my taste. Maybe I'm too grown up, it cause some internal eye-rolling for me.
B008I34YYY|4.0|Movie<br />Fantastic. Skeweres everybody and everything. Tounge-in-cheek Euro/Scandinavian humor. If it offends you, loosen up! If you don't 'get it', sorry. Her clothes fly off when they accidentally are exposed to vaccum. Ridiculous and totally hilarious. Script is occasionally a bit forced on occasion, but this is rare. Portrayal of the President of the USA is proabbly the funniest, cleverest thing I've seen on film this decade. Thanks!<br /><br />Transfer<br />Looks phenomenal, especially given the teeny tiny budget.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|It is a wonderful game, hard to put down at times.  The difficulty increases gradually, and some of the later solutions are quite artistic.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love this charging case! It not only charges your headset, but it also looks great and will help me to not lose another headset. Great buy!
B007THA4FI|2.0|The book was very slow and the characters seemed jumbled. Missed the plot. This was written for Harry Potter fans that have grown up and reads like a Harry Potter book...would never recommend or bought it had I known it was going to be like it was.
B005B19UPE|4.0|I purchased this book on a whim, having never heard of the title or the author.  Oh my goodness, Sarah's Key is an amazing and emotional read! It is a thoroughly absorbing  story about a little known event during WWII. The author was able to elicit very deep emotions in brief chapters with little fluff. I believe I actually experienced some of the obsessions of Julia Jarmond, the main character, myself. This story and its subject matter will stay with me for a long time. I agree with other reviewers that the end of the story is weaker than the remainder of the book, but that is only a small drawback. Thank you Ms. DeRosnay for writing about a tragic event that we should all be aware of and never allow to reoccur.  I have already passed this book on to another.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great way to relax with a qame that has games within it's self...<br />The graphics are wonderful... very well done...
B0000TG9E2|5.0|My kids really love this movie and they are only 2 and 3 years of age. When I ordered this the sellers description was that the product was used and possibly missing the original case and so on...but the movie is brand new. Even all the original inserts were included and unopened.  Awesome!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|It works well enough for a small travel sharpener. The main point for getting it is my half-serrated pocketknife, for which I wanted a slim bar sharpener. My basic sharpening stones at home do a much better job on a straight blade, but for a lightweight travel sharpener this is decent.
1589795474|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  Keep in mind that this is not a &#34;how to get rich&#34; guide.  The subject matter is simply a compilation of surveys, statistics, and anecdotes regarding the lives and habits of American millionaires.  You can glean several takeaways from reading this book.  Let this be one of many books that you read about personal finance.  Again, it's not a how-to, but instead observations about the habits and traits common among the wealthy.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Not sure what all the Angry Bird hipe was about.<br />Fun for a couple days then it was just boring.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, now an allegedly major motion picture, is a well-written novel of varied characters, times, and ideas.  Far less confusing than the movie derived therefrom, the book doesn't stumble until one considers slight but irksome weaknesses in the construction of the elaborate, centuries-spanning plot or dares to expect a satisfying ending (the movie attempted to address the latter, with limited success).<br />All in all, a worthwhile read for the exploration of past and future, human character, and language.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have enjoyed this totally.<br />I wait eagerly for people to guess my drawings and send me drawings in return.<br />Some of these folks are really talented - some, not so much! LOL
B007REV4T8|5.0|I saw the movie in the theatre and loved it! I'm a big James Bond fan,and I think this movie is thbest Bond movie ever!
B008FOB124|4.0|This is my 3rd DCD album, over about a 15 year period.  I find myself prefering this one over the other two, partly because its new, and partly because it speaks to me a little more than the others.  The first song, Children of the son will likely intrique you right away, and so do a few others.  Then, after a dozen or so listenings, I found my self pretty intriqued with most all of the songs.  There was a write-up in a local arts and entertainment mag. that gave this album a 4 out 5 score, and thing that is pretty accurate.  Something very nice about the cadence and variety of the songs.  So it grew on me very well.  I was joking'ly telling a friend, I quess I would call this style or genre of music - Old World New Age, if there is such a thing?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The same idea as temple run..So, if you like temple run then...you'll l like this game :)  cool graphics and bright colors :)
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I gained a new and greater appreciation for Pi's suffering. Not for the lighthearted. Definitely worth-while. Pi's Indian life is half the book but I found this interesting and amusing.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I loved it so much that I bought it, which is rare for me these days...with Amazon Prime and Netflix, I don't buy that many.  This movie has everything.  I love each one of the characters and the whole series.  I haven't gotten through the special features, but downloaded the comic book and soundtrack included.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|I am a big fan of Iron man and loved this movie it's worth getting on Blu-ray for the quality.

159562015X|4.0|I've taken Strengths Finder 3 different times, over the span of 8 years.  I have had different results each time, but am not disappointed.  I find that my strengths change with what is being asked in the position.  I will take it again in several years.  There is always something to learn about yourself, and others.
1451696191|4.0|I didn't read this book until I was 20, but I enjoyed it just as much as I would have at 15. Of course I would have seen it differently at the beginning of high school than now as a college student. But I think it is really relatable for high school students, particularly for those who don't stand out, and even those who do but don't realize it. It takes time for Charlie to make friends, just as it does for many of us. Perhaps it's not entirely realistic to think that any person who is shy and unpopular to win the heart of such an amazing person, but Charlie is a good example of the ability for someone to gain confidence. I will always remember this book as one of my favorites from my young adult years.
B0085YNML2|5.0|This adorable game is worth much more than a buck! Puzzles are challenging but can be perfected with practice. Bright colors and good sound too.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I purchased this item because it was recommend to me by a sound guy in Hollywood. He works on many reality shows in LA. I told him I was looking for the industry standard headphones and this is the item he recommended. He and other sound guys trust their hearing to the Sony MDR7506.

B005HP2J66|5.0|Cave of Forgotten Dreams introduces civilization and advanced artistic culture just imagined before the discovery of this wonderful find.  I was in awe of the drawings--they show depth and style that artists today would aspire to.  My only sadness is in not being able to see them in person...but to preserve them forever far overides my wish.  Extraordinary in every way...and seems to have been filmed in the best possible way considerng necessary restrictions.  Well done--and I'm grateful it was made so we can see these cave paintings.  They actually, in a strange way, gave more freedom to my art as well!

I hope this review was very helpful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :  )
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|Wow, this could really help me when I travel to stay on task with my workouts. It was targets specific &offered video.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I enjoyed the movie, but the book has more room for depth and adds a lot of background which the movie could not cover.  Compelling storytelling and full of conflict between the jocks and the brains.  A must read for any serious baseball fan.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I didn't know I would have to start over completely from scratch!  So frustrating!!  Its the same program from the same maker,  Game Insight... Why doesn't it just convert over from android to tablet/Kindle????

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a good book, I couldn't put it down. On to the next, in the series. Much better than I expected.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|The whole concept of the movie is one that kids with experience playing video games will appreciate, yet there are jokes here to appeal to the grown-ups' sense of humor, too. It's a fun movie that the family will enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|If I was 17 I would probably have enjoyed this book. I caught hints of 'Twilight-esque' scenarios. It just wasn't for me.  I' m sure it will appeal to the younger generation.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Everything was as expected. It was a gift for someone else.They enjoyed it very much Josh is their favorite singer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Fantastic story told through fantastic actors!<br />We just love this show! On the edge every week!<br />We just hate having to wait 24 hrs to see it!!!
B0000524CY|5.0|got to see the version i never seen.  good to see some of the interesting clips that hit the cutting floor,  actually helped me understand the movie better,
0345803485|1.0|What a waste of time. Having just finished a few books by Nicholas Sparks, I thought I'd try this \\"erotica\\" I've been hearing all about. Might have a few good sex scenes in it and a compelling story.<br />NOPE AND NOPE<br />The sex scenes take up about 70% of the book, most of which gets repetitive and boring after the first 10... I skipped over most of them.<br />And the characters are so stupid. If I ever hear the words \\"inner goddess\\" again I'm going to jump in front of a bus.<br />IT'S WRITTEN LIKE A BAD PORNO. Maybe if you have zero experience with reading you might like it. Or maybe if you're 14 and giggle every time she says \\"he touched me in my sex\\" <--- wtf?! But other than that.. Stay away. Such a waste of time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I LOVED THIS APP.  It is very realistic and never gets old.  I was searching for horse games and found four.  I tried all four and of all this one was the best.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This story  is so realistic. At some parts I was close to crying. Yann Mattel did an amazing. As stated in the book he explained Pi's story in 100 chapters no more or no less. A very vivid heart touching story was written. Hats off!
034553056X|5.0|Again a hit  for John Griham. You'll love how you're pulled into this. You won't want to stop reading until it's finished.
B005DJ7U5G|5.0|This movie is way better than I expected.  Figured it was crud so didn't bother to see in theaters.  Coworkers said it was good so I got it.  Really glad I bought it.  Kids loved it too.  Don't recall any kid offensive parts.
B000EWD1KK|5.0|This willl make you laugh!!! You'll sit back & think about someone or yourself who reminds you of Walter. This is just a great way to spend sometime with Walter Mitty(Danny Kaye). I enjoyed this
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Really liked this movie.  Thought I heard it didn't get great reviews, but it was really good to me.  Family\kids liked it just as much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the hunger game series and I love Suzanne Collins I have read a l l of her books
B005LAIGW8|2.0|Loved the first movie.  This one kinda sucked.  Was expecting far better.  Editing was bad and story line just as bad.
0920236162|5.0|Loved this book! I have nothing against princesses, but this book makes her the heroine and I love it. Great choice for young girls.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This one kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldn't put it down. I'm waiting for the next one and it feels like an eternity!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing cast and story that draws you in from the first episode. You will not want it to end. A wonderful must see from Amazon!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I LOVED the first installment of this series, so I knew I had to read the rest! I think I read the whole series in less than a week it was so good! Book 2 is an amazing sequel to the first one. I love that we get a better insight to Fifty and the way things work in his mind.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Uncle Mike's and other &#34;tactical&#34; flashlight holders pale in comparison.  This adjusts to the size of your light, stretching if needed, but still holds it snugly.  Also fits on my duty belt.  Awesome holder.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was a prefect way to end the trilogy! I love that we get to see Christian and Anna's relationship progress. I wish this trilogy didn't end!!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I loved the novels, so naturally, the movies tend to be a disappointment. This one, however was dead-on to the book. The camera shots were a little too close, but the storyline was perfect.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I wasn't sure how I was going to like this book at first, as I usually don't like these types of books. I love Ellen, so I thought this one would be different, and I was right. Ellen is awesome, and her book is no different. I definitely laughed out loud at some points in this book.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|We purchased this DVD as a gift and the recipient enjoyed the subject the movie portrayed, and the christian values it conveyed.
6305127638|5.0|I love this movie, the dvd was in good condition. i will cherish this dvd for years to come. thanks
B00005JN8Z|4.0|If you  enjoy great actor and actress from the 40's - 60's this is a great movie to purchase. We enjoy the Director's from that era.
B006RXQBUC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I had seen it before as a friend let me borrow his DVD of it a few years ago.  I am probably going to buy it on Blu-ray, as I do enjoy it enough to watch it more than once.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|I think it is a great book because it have lots of excitement an  adventures while you are also learning historical facts If Greece gods
B00APUYN0I|5.0|My daughter, 12-years old turning 13 in March, 2013, kept asking to watch this movie.  She had seen it over at some friends before, as well as hearing about it in school.<br />She had a friend spend the night, same age, so I decided to see if it was available on Amazon.com Prime.  Even though it was not a free video, I didn't mind the price as it is always less expensive to rent a video from Amazon.com than it is to rent one via the On Demand feature with Comcast.<br />I ordered it, started it playing and went over to my computer to apply my headphones (Bose AR-15 which I also bought on Amazon.com) and turn up some of my music so I didn't have to sit through a bunch of current &#34;Top 40 teeny bopper,&#34; music.  How wrong I was!  The movie has tons of 80s and 90s music, most of it remixed, and remixed nicely!  I got off the computer during the first song after the girls told me this was the kind of music that was through all of the movie.  I loved it!  I do admit it would be difficult for me to tell you much about the movie, other than I'm pretty sure it's the standard, root for the underdog and she gets the great guy/he gets the great girl theme.  I'm not knocking this movie at all.  The kids loved it, and I loved the music.<br />My daughter turns 13 this month, March, 2013, and will be getting this on Blu-ray as one of her presents.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Purchased as a download for my daughter. She loves Nicholas Sparks works. The story is great love story for all ages to read.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|love this game and it works well with no issues!! I highly recommend this game! so fun and easy to play!
0064430170|5.0|My kids grew up with me reading this book to them. I purchased for my grandson. He's only 16 months old so not yet a fan but sits for a reading of a few pages a time.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris was a great guy and down to earth like most of the guys I've met from the different teams over the years. R.I.P.  Chris Kyle
B004OZZ624|5.0|The movie is very well made. I had to finish it once I started. Crowe was being Crowe, and the other cast is pretty good too. The director has taken a lot of time to build the characters that it built - which stretched the movie out a little bit. It is well done! Must watch!
B008518MOW|5.0|If you are a MIB fan, then the 3D is for you!  And this multi-disc set is a bargain, because you can share it with friends who don't have 3D.
B009RROP12|5.0|Jimi Jamison is putting out his finest work ever.Excellent vocals woven together with potent lyrics and amazing melodic rock'nroll instrumentality!
B006H5120E|5.0|What a nice addition to my 3D collection! And with only 12 more words needed, I guess that makes this a more meaningful review.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|I couldn't say I hated the movie because I couldn't watch it.  It stopped and buffered probably 10 times, the quality of the movie was terrible. I will NEVER purchase a movie for rental through Amazon again
1401929281|5.0|Arrived at schedule. Read few pages and notified a higher level of healing and learning. For me, this involves spirituality and divinity and I like it  but needs more concentration. Meanwhile, I should start from the basic before jumping up. But I like this book.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|&#34;Believe it or not,&#34; this is a great story. Full of fun with awesome 80s references! Can't wait to see it come to life in theaters. Thanks for the amazing ride! &#34;I'm walkin' on air!&#34;
B00377V6J2|5.0|Some really great guitar playing and minimum singing.  I've always thought great instrumentalists should shutup and play (Clapton is a great example) and average (or worse) instrumentalists should sing more (or all the time).
B0036SUQWA|4.0|Funny movie with great actors and a quirky story, but it is really hard to follow for non-native English speakers. I really wish the Amazon digital purchases had CC (closed captioning) or subtitles of some sort!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An easy read and a continuation of the great writing of this author.  Highly recommended for those over 16 years of age.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book and it left me wanting more of fifty and Ana. You have to be very open minded to enjoy this trilogy but I thought the story was excellent
B008LB8EOY|4.0|This album is worth the buy - listen on MOG first, then get it for keeps.  It's a kinduv mashup for the movie soundtrack and a free thinking Vangelis title.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I like romance and suspense, I liked the main characters  Everyone else, including the children, I didn't care if they were in the story or not.<br />The end was so silly and half expected.<br />I didn't finish the final few pages.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|bought for my two daughters, they love these cats and drag them around everywhere. I've actually bought more because they love them so much
0785165975|4.0|If you like the Kick-Ass comic series, or graphic novel, you will love this.  This story focuses on, of course, Hit-Girl.  You get to follow her through the trials, and tribulations, of being a young girl, while trying to pursue her destiny, as a vigilante.  Very entertaining.
B006O6F932|5.0|My nine year old daughter loves all the monster high stuff and she has been wanting this for a long time.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I use this app primarily to tune into my (almost local) NPR station. For that, XiiaLive is world's better than NPR's official app (which crashes on me frequently). I was even able to configure XiiaLive to start streaming automatically whenever I connect to the bluetooth receiver in my car. Very useful!    You may see mention of the sticky broadcast permission in some earlier reviews. The developer removed that requirement with their latest version. More importantly, they explained why on their website. Kudos to the dev for communicating with us about a common concern! See:    [...]
B005HSL626|4.0|This game rocks because it is so colorful and any age can play it. It is such a joyful game. I just &lt;3 it
B00336G7HI|5.0|This battery has provided a very useful back up to the one supplied with the digital camera.  Expensive and of cours no competition.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best!!!! Wonderful graphics,  Beauty my horse is beautiful and I love the activities!!!!!!!! Best horse game on the appstore!!!!!!!! I give My Horse 1,000,000 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the whole seires. Can not wait for them to make the other two movies to see how they turn out and what twists they put in or take out.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The Secret Keeper is a beautiful story of family, love, loss, and redemption that spans across several decades. So many details and discoveries combine to make this a book worth reading as, until the very end, we are treated to more pieces of the puzzle. I highly recommend The Secret Keeper for anyone who enjoys books with history, romance (the sweet and wonderful kind, as opposed to the smarmy kind) and suspense. You won't be disappointed!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|It was boring from the beginning, just talked about how she kept forgetting things everyday she woke up. But things started getting weird in the middle of the story and there was a big twist suddenly at the end. The pace was hard to catch up at last. Overall it is very unexpected and I recommend to read it.
0596000480|1.0|JavaScript developing has changed so much that this book is just no longer useful. The current edition is an excellent work, but programming in JavaScript has changed a lot since the 4th edition was published.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|simply enjoying the challenge.  it is relaxing yet keeps me stimulated and wanting to move up the levels - am playing against my husband as to who moves thrum the levels faster.
0385349947|3.0|I didn't read it because when I opened the box the binding job was horrible. I returned book promptly. So it is not about the story. I still want to read the book.
0385344228|4.0|Defending Jacob directly confronts the issue of whether character traits are predetermined by nature or molded by nurture.  The jury is still out on the issue, but the consensus is that it is a combination of both. Jacob's father, Andy Barber is the local D.A.  He is successful in his chosen field.  The community in which the Barber's live and work is Newton, Mass, a safe affluent and highly educated community.  When Ben Rifkin one of Jacob's classmates is found murdered in the park, the town is shocked.  Jacob is identified as the prime suspect after others are ruled out. Andy Barber has never revealed to his wife his checkered family background.  His father is in jail for murder.  His grandfather was also convicted of murder. He is concerned that there is a murder gene and that he has passed it on to Jacob.  His wife is angry that he chose to conceal these facts.  The trial and the strains it puts on this family are the heart of the novel.  How does a family survive the isolation, financial burdens and fear that a murder trial produces.  Their only child, Jacob is the accused.  Andy is put on paid leave because of the potential for a conflict of interest.  Thus, he has no work to occupy his time. The people who were once close family friends such as Duffy, the police inspector assigned to the D.A.'s office, suddenly must distance themselves from the family.  Alone and frightened Laurie Barber, Andy Barber, and Jacob Barber face this tumultuous experience.<br />A psychiatrist is contacted for consultation.  Her job is to identify whether or not Jacob has any inherited traits that might make him more likely to engage in criminal activity. She does identify some of those traits and she then begins to construct evidence of mitigation should Jacob be convicted.  The traits she identifies include lack of empathy, an inability to form normal parental attachments as an infant and impulsivity.  For lack of a better description, these could be called \\"murder genes.\\"  Jacobhas a sketchy history of cruelty to small animals. He also has a history of \\"rough\\" or physically violent behavior with other small children his own age. Andy and Laurie believe that they have successfully dealt with his tendency to be \\"rough\\" with other small children and that the trait disappeared by the time Jacob was 5. Both his mother and father avoid characterizing his behavior as anything but ordinary growing pains.  Parents can identify with Andy and Laurie Barber and the daily horror they must face as the court case moves along. Andy correctly articulates the problems they are facing.  Even if Jacob is adjudicated as not guilty, that does not mean he is innocent.  It merely means that the evidence does not prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. I do  not want to create a spoiler here.  Spoiler alert: However, someone else confesses to the crime and commits suicide. There is some indication to  Andy that it is a false confession. Andy, Laurie, and Jacob flushed with relief take a much needed family vacation to Jamaica.  They stay at a luxurious beach resort.  Jacob meets and befriends a teen girl who is also a guest at the resort.  Andy and Laurie are thrilled that Jacob is returning to the normal activities engaged in by 14 year old boys.  Then the girl Jacob has befriended disappears. She is discovered seven weeks later when her body washes ashore.  She has drowned, but her windpipe has also been crushed as if she were strangled. The Jamaican police cannot clearly call her a victim of homicide. However, Laurie now knows that in spite of the confession her son is a murderer, and he has killed twice.  What happens next is the twist in the tale.<br />Defending Jacob is a fast paced legal thriller.  Men as well as women will be entertained by the story. I had trouble identifying with the mother.  The characters were somewhat well drawn, but the mother especially was not drawn with much depth.  I found it hard to believe that in spite of the fact that herfamily was willing to sit with her at trial she chose to suffer further by sitting alone. This story will make a better movie than it has a book.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|It's so much funny when they ride the cranium shaker  and<br />When they trick the boys with the money hope my next book is<br />Like this one
B009RWPAA2|5.0|Listening to this on vinyl makes me wish for a much better audio system!! The boys really kick arse on their latest release and do not disappoint!!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I only finished this book because I'd already paid for it. I kept reading so I could get to the end and even then was disappointed that I did.  I know this book has gotten a lot of good reviews but it just didn't click with me.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|...when you take your finger off the arrow. Moves without being touched. Temperamental when jumping. Fun, irritating, Mario rip-off. Almost a guilty pleasure.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Watching reruns is normally a nuscence for me, but not with this series.  Castle is a program that my husband and I watch, and even if we catch a rerun, we watch it over as if it were a new show.  Yes, we know the ending, but it doesn't really matter to us.  I purchased season 1-4 and when 5 is over, that will be ordered too.  This video will stay on our shelf for a long , long time and will be watched over and again.
B00008438V|5.0|Loved the movie then and love it now! This is a great addition to my 80's collection at a great price!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|We love Castle and love all seasons of it.  It was a great buy. Love the actors, and the storyline.
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|Loved the movie, Love Channing Tatum!!!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game! A lot of fun to play and the goals are achievable! I love the different options and seasonal horse wear! I think everyone should play this game is they like horses and other animals. A good games for any age of player.
B0053O89KG|5.0|We love Castle and love all seasons of it.  It was a great buy.  Castle is a keep in my home.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great additive game and it just keep on updating more places to visit i would give this game infinity stars if I could (thumps up)XD
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. It is so fun I could play it all day long. Get this game it is worth it.
B000SEFM6K|3.0|Collins' novel is dated, being set in the early Victorian era,and uses contrivances to advance the plot, particularly eccentric characters and cardboard cut-out caricatures in places.  Accepting the limitations of the period of its writing, it is still a good yarn with a few unforeseen twists and turns.  The presentation in the form of declarations by various characters or readings from their journals is annoying at times, but, as it pushes the plot along, it is bearable.  Having heard about the novel for many years, I was keen to read it. Overall, I was not disappointed, although the obligatory ultimate triumph of good over evil and happiness ever after were entirely predictable, and, as we know, totally divorced from the realities then and now.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. My daughter seriously loves it. She wants to watch it just about everyday! Good for adults and children.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|I was happy when I found this doll. My GF is a big Hello Kitty fan and I know she would love it. The doll came in a little box with a bit of protective paper inside. The doll came with the tag and arrived with no blemishes. I am very happy, and my GF was thrilled.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is  free and awesome<br />You should buy it<br />I  was addicted to it day #1.<br />I love it so much
B003TQKVGU|5.0|If you want to learn how to reprogram your brain and get what you want, this is a great book to read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It wrote good be they are too clingy but don't not read it .I understand the author choice it okay
B007WULJ5G|5.0|Great sound, good quality.  This is a great movie.  Hard scenes, intensity, emotionalism,  not recommended for all type of viewers.  Thanks.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Read review that is all very great game  need more resource game early on so game can progress much faster and smoother
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I've learned that there are movies we see where our expectations are completely different that what we see on the screen.  I felt that way after seeing the movie at the theater.  I loved Charlize Theron's portrayal of the evil wackadoodle queen and for that reason used a gift card I received to purchase the BD in the extended version. When I watched it the second time I discarded all expectations about the movie and all the Disney imprinted storylines.  I thoroughly enjoyed the flick on the second viewing, except for the ending.  The ending of the movie is basically non-existent.  Yes, I understand exactly what the director was attempting to do romantically, but I kept waiting for someone to say something.  It had a feeling like everyone forgot their lines or didn't know what to say.  Heck, it would have been better if someone on the screen would have said \\"Hey, the movie's over.  Go home.\\"  For that reason I gave the movie 4 stars and debated giving it 3.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome awesome AWSOME AWSOME BLA BLANKET FOR FREE DOWNLOAD IN THE FIRST TIME IN MY MIND AND THE FIRST TIME SINCE I WAS A GREAT BOY
B000QJM8Z0|2.0|I love to read books and thought of this one when someone randomly mentioned the movies. The book is so boring and has no flow. maybe because of the way it's written, just like a true diary with daily entries. But, now I know this is not the format for me.
078322611X|5.0|What can I say! I never tire of watching this film. It still stands the hair on the back of my neck on end. It still sends goosebumps up my arms. It still brings tears to my eyes.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Said it all in the title.  Perhaps one could quibble with one of the casting choices, but it all fits together.  A must see.
B000059TEQ|3.0|Although I think that &#34;Love Story&#34; is a good movie, I remember that when it first came out everyone loved the film. Ali MacGraw had earned my love and admiration as an actress for her performance. Due to the attractive price, I am pleased to add this to my collection.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series keeps getting better and better. My wife and i started with season 1 and we're marching right through.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is a book you don't want to put down.  I can't say that it is my usual style of reading but have heard so much about it.  Makes you wonder how close it is to reality in some sections of our world.  Twelve to adult.
1592407889|5.0|I enjoyed reading LUCKY ME.  It was well written and an easy read.  I did not skim over any parts because I thought each event was an integral part of Sachis interesting life.  I believe both her parents loved her and that is why she was able to step outside of her life and look at her situations objectively.  There were certainly actions by her parents that would doom most parent child relationships, but happily Sachi was able to get past the weirdnesses and have a happy productive life and be a good Mom to her children.  I think this actually was a \\"Love Story\\" to her parents rather than  \\"Mommie Dearest\\"  I hated to finish reading the book.
B001GWK2MC|2.0|I bought this product for my daughters 2nd birthday. The first day it was awesome, no problems what so ever. The next day it had a hole in the bottom and the patch that comes with it was crap. Mostly all of the reviews I read said this product got a hole on the second use if not the first. I should have listened to the other cosumers. So disapointed...
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Love the Temple Run franchise, but for some odd reason Temple Run 2 crashes when I switch to best quality while playing the game on Kindle Fire 1st generation tablet. Please fix this soon...
B00846REIS|4.0|Seriously. You kill me with the cliff hanger. Always leaving me to want more. I did love this book. It's nothing g like Fifty Shades but it has a club of it's own.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Had to get over the premise question, which was TRUE, but could have enriched story more...instead of quickly glossing over: Should those people have been there in the first place?
B008673ZAQ|4.0|In my opinion it's nothing like Fifty Shades except for the amount of f-ed upness. However both characters are complex which keeps you interested and guessing and engaged. Can't wait for book 3!
0307744434|2.0|I'll keep it short and to the point. Overly descriptive and about 100 pages too long. One of the rare cases where the movie would be better than the book.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|A disappointing read. I was looking for another &#34;bad ass guy&#34; series to get into, similar to the Vince Flynn-Mitch Rapp series, but this does not appear to be it. A little too simplistic, with a very predictable story line. I might try the next in the series to see if it is any better, but I would probably not recommend this one.
0345525558|5.0|A book you won't want to put down. Refreshing and wonderfully written. I am still thinking about the characters. You will enjoy it.
B000HKYN74|2.0|...but that's not saying much.  When the writing had a chance to take off, it meandered.  It never really dealt with the science of the Expanse, or of any of the races that were trying to live under it.  (The writers barely dealt with science at all.)  In the TOS storyline, the immediate history proceeding that series had several wars - including the genetic war of Kahn fame that should have just happened - that would have logically made a pretty tougher Capt. Archer than even the one presented in this third year.  Instead, they seemed to have modeled this guy on The X-Files' Mulder.  If the truth be told, this series seemed to have a lot of envy for The X-Files and Star Wars. (The Zindi Council seemed to be lifted out of Star Wars II - Attack of the Clones.  I had expected maybe there was a Zindi race of robots, too.)<br /><br />This season seemed to be about saving the show...which, it turned out, it didn't.  I had this feeling that the creators of the show thought that if they expressed the frustrations that the audience felt with many of the on-going storylines that the series adopted - say by making Capt. Archer be snarly with Crewman Daniels - that they would get the audience more into the show.  They re-developed a bunch of the characters including the Capt.  (T'Pal smoking a crack pipe?!!?)  In my opinion, the only one that worked was Trip's development - he was definitely a lot less annoying. (Imagine, a chief engineer that has to stay on the ship, and engineer!) But, again, that's not saying much.<br /><br />Many of the side storylines also seemed underdeveloped.  The space Jihad story was probably the worst ever written for a Trek series.  The alien cowboy story also left something to be desired.  Staying on the last story for a moment, why wasn't any effort spent to try and find out what the continued exposure to the Expanse would do to humans by studying it's effect on the cowboys?  Were the writers into this storyline?  Especially with their efforts onthe cowboy and Jihad stories, it didn't seem like it.  The Jihad story was too topical, and not very well thought out.<br /><br />The Idea of having a prequel to TOS was a hugh selling point for me to watch the first season of the show back in 2001.  It was a big disappointment as far as I was concerned.  Further, with what was going on with 9/11, my focus wasn't on sci-fi, it was on friends going to war.  I thought I was a little unfair to some of the early shows of this series due to the distraction of 9/11, and that I would in later years have a chance to look at the reruns, and be able to get caught up in the show.  So far, I've taken the last year to go over the first three seasons, and I'm sorry to say that my first opinion was spot on.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|He is an honest man.  He doesn't gloss himself up, but isn't afraid to tell us his faults.  Neither is he afraid to tell us what politicians and government officials are doing to the soldiers to make their jobs more difficult and dangerous.  I think every citizen should read this book, and highly recommend it.  In fact, I have been telling everyone I know about it!  I will be donating to his family to get his bronze statue done.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app works like a weather app should. It accepts the location and gives a weather report on it. It also gives an extended day forecast.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I've read all his books but one or two and this one is the worst.  I didn't even finish it.  Who gives a rat's butt<br />what the population of all the metro areas is?
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have wanted to read Les Mis since I was in high school, but I could never find a decent version. I was thrilled to see it on the list for Amazon when I purchased my Kindle! This version is exactly what I was looking for, and the story, even better.
6305291446|5.0|Purchased this DVD along w/others for my husband. They were perfectly wrapped, no torn or damaged boxes. The DVD quality was at the top, no skips or fuzzy pictures. Well worth the lower prices!  I love the Halloween series too!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game. It's a lot of fun and teases my brain. No better way to spend your down time!
B0013D8LCW|4.0|This is overall romantic in nature, but it has some unexpected turns that may confuse the viewer.  Overall. It was well done and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of some minor flaws in the story line that dud not allow the main character to be fully defined as I think he hound have been.  It s a great movie and I found it highly entertaining.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome.... it is really addicting too.. they should make more characters and boards... I don't like how the boards and characters have a limited time to buy them though.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Sure, the first few levels are easy - just wait.  It takes real concentration, creativity, and old-fashioned thinking.  Great for the brain rather than the texting thumbs.  Works perfectly on the Kindle Fire.
B007HACDLK|3.0|It was fine although I expected more.  I thought it was somewhat predictable and the lines are becoming boring. Still worth reading
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like this calculator for its ease of use and large button format.  Great value for zero cost ... thanks!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This is an excellent Dystopian novel! Character development is spectacular. A MUST READ! I think it will be the next Hunger Games.
0307346609|5.0|the book was a gift for my son's girlfriend and he said she really enjoyed the story.  It lived up to it's expectations.
B003A03RRU|5.0|This is a very loooong book, it has all the books, stories, etc. it's a classic so no need to explain more, if you're a fan of Conan Doyle's way of writing then this one is perfect for you
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins has written a series that includes many variables, including her intellect, creativity, thought-provoking issues,  history, and futuristic possibilities that are all so interwoven that some readers, especially teens, May not perceive unless someone ,such as a parent or teacher, gives them some  well directed. Questions or some comments to encourage them to THINK!  Personally, as a retired educator, I think that this series should be on a Required Reading List for high school students with a teacher utilizing utilizing The Panam Companion by V. Arrow as a guide to classroom discussions, writing prompts, etc.<br /><br />I suggest that adult readers would also highly enjoy this series.  I know I certainly have enjoyed them and admit unashamedly that I have 're-read the series more than once!  I suggest that you may as well read The Panam Guide by V. Arrow as well since this guide makes these books even more interesting.<br />To say that I am a fan is an understatement!<br /><br />stewartreb@me.com
B00ARAO720|3.0|The movie played great & it was easy to order. The movie itself wast an &#34;ok&#34; movie. I'm not going to rush to tell my friends, but I'm not disappointed I watched it either.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Great CD and again they do their rock level best with this cd!  I love Rush, so it's a given I will love just about everything they put out!  I've seen them in concert 3 times, twice during their meager beginnings and just two summers ago with my grown daughter and she loves them too!
B000UVT3OI|4.0|I think it is a great CD for the money, but wish some of his other great songs were on it. Like Ireland and others.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|way to easy+ not scary enough. I thought finding all 8 notes was very simple and I also though it
B004SIPAJG|2.0|It plays just fine, that's all I really require of a DVD.  Not really what I'd expected.  Wouldn't recommend it.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|it was ok. story line. but some of the ho were so small and dark you could not see them. not worth 2.99
B005DOKL3E|5.0|It fits perfectly and seems to protect well. Very satisfied with the purchase. Would definitely recommend. Worth the purchase price.
B00607EWYC|5.0|Every sentence is well written. The story is touching and profound. All through the impressive development of the scenarios and the memories of the characters, the author can communicate some feelings and experiences that I thought were extremely difficult to live through the written word.
B00511PTWM|5.0|The AmazonBasics Dual-Port Swivel Cigarette Lighter Adapter-Black, is great. I only had one hole for the cigerete lighter in my Toyota to use, so I bought this product and was able to have two ports:<br />1st port to charge my Phone<br />2nd port to charge my Bluetooth<br />Really a great product. It is very convenient that it moves up and down.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|BEST GAME OF THE HUNGRY SHARK SERIES AND I HAVE BEEN HAPPY PLAYING IT ALL THE WAY TO HUSTON LOL
B009VA1FN6|3.0|Not the best of Kate Morton but I still read it avidly. The story was a bit hard to follow because of the shifts in time.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This trilogy pack is beautifully packaged and while worth the money spent. Complete in the package is a booklet, 3 discs that contain beautifully acted and awe-inspiring film chronicle. I personally have never been one to be all that into Batman movies or anything like that, but after hearing all the buzz about Heath Ledger's role as the Joker, I finally caved and bought the trilogy pack...and wow, am I glad I did! The first film, Batman Begins, explains the backstory as to why Batman became who he was bound to become, why he rids Gotham city of evil, and, on top of all of that, has beautiful cinematography and directing chops. You then dig into the second installment of the film, The Dark Knight, which is probably (my personal) the best film in this trilogy. Heath Ledger's acting chops won me over. The hype over the film was well-deserved; his acting was amazing and top-notch. I have yet to watch The Dark Knight rises, but if the first 2 films are any indication of whats in store, I can hardly wait to feast my eyes up on the third film. :)<br /><br />All in all, this 3-disc set is well-worth your money for any avid movie lover/Batman fan.
B0095BFO0Q|5.0|One wonders if Moretti knew something the rest of us didn't when he wrote this movie. Growing up in Rome he surely knew that Pope John XXIII used to slip the Swiss Guards and walk around Rome incognito. He was very possibly aware that it would be next to impossible to fill the shoes of a rock star Pope Like John Paul II.<br /><br />I believe Moretti has unintentionally managed to give us a prophetic, affectionate, and endearing glimpse into what Pope Benedict might have struggled with as he realized his decision.  The Church needs to face tremendous issues in an ever complex world where more than a billion people look to one man to show them how to live their lives.  It's no wonder the modest, introverted and, yes, aging Benedict found the task more than anyone could ask of him.<br /><br />Exceptional movie well worth seeing.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Package was sent in pristine condition and contents on DVD were of the highest caliber as usual. Thank you for saving me mass amounts of time and money searching for this iconic video. My daughter is now a die hard Goonie!
0756655307|5.0|Wow , the whole family loves this book it tells so much history on all the marvel characters. If you love comics you'll love this.
