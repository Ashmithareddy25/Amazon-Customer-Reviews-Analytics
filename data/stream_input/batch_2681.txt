B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is super fun.  The only problem I have had is that I have had some issues with the game not wanting to start.  I had to re download it.  Otherwise, this game is highly recommended.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It's just amazing, Magic: The Gathering is one of the best card games I've ever played, and to be able to play it on my Kindle Fire is just wonderful. And the features are amazing as well, thanks for the game, I had and am still having fun with it.
1616551151|5.0|This book is absolutely gorgeous.  There is new art riddled throughout the book, which is organized like a brief history of Thedas.  I love how it has several different style elements that mesh well together; entertaining the quick skim-through readers as well as the in-depth lore addicts.  Every time I read it, I find something new!  Definitely recommended for the Dragon Age fanatic in your life.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I enjoyed this one because it followed story lines . it was reasonable to play in the expert mode,and the story was fun to follow. each puzzle led you further into the story. was relaxing and fun.i think if you are looking for all of that this is the game for you
B004J4XGN6|5.0|This is a great book for helping ANY size company launch successful new products and services! The tips provide you with efficient ways to reduce risk using the best lean tools and concepts, with  an analytical approach
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob is both well written and engaging.  Landay's development of the character and the many twists and turns of the story combine to make a great read.
B002ROKQJM|4.0|It was simple, lovely, believable. You totally side with his character, right or wrong. The writer transports you to his characters world and keeps you there...
B002W7H3EA|5.0|What's not to like with Cary Grant????  It was a little risqué for the time it was filmed and added some allure.
B00005JLEU|5.0|What a great movie! It's creative and magical. I got drawn right into the movie when I watched this. I recommend watching it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Lots of fun and a challenge too! Enjoyed solving the puzzles and figuring out the mystery....a few startled as well!
B0094K1WZE|5.0|This movie is filled with actions and Tom Cruise is still the best.  I highly recommend to watch the HD version.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|kisnda easy hard to get some items due to touch detection. fun overall though<br /><br />would like harder puzzles or different puzzles.
B0006J28BO|5.0|This movie is great. I love cats and this movie is great for people who love cats. I laughed out a lot in this movie.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I was recommended this by a friend and began watching season one. I was completely hooked by the second episode. Even though I could watch season's one and two through Netflix, my husband said I simply HAD to order the whole collection since we would want to watch it again sometime!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A must read for anyone interested in history, group dynamics and leadership. The story is a testament to what can be done with selfless leadership and a commitment to the common good.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It was great to finally see another book from Neil Gaiman. Tore through it in a few hours! Very moving story
B00003CXBK|5.0|Before I watched this movie the only other movie I had seen by this director was \\"My Neighbor Totoro.\\" I really like that movie. So when I started to watch this movie I was a bit taken aback. It had violence in it that I wasn't expecting. I don't mind violence, but \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" was nothing like that, so it surprised me. I wasn't in the mood for it, so I decided not to watch it. But I'm glad I gave it another chance. It's so good!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I LOVE the game on the computer, it is a little harder to play on  the kindle without a mouse.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|These guys do a great job, and you can really tell they love doing it and love music.  The DVD with the videos from u-tube are an extra bonus.  Keep up the great work guys and hope to see more in the near future.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Some of the last levels are kind of tricky, but it's fairly entertaining. I would recommend it if you like puzzles.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|The story and scenery in this movie are amazing. It's an uplifting and inspiring type of movie. \\"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind\\" is definitely in my top 5 of movies from this director.
B006UG909U|3.0|Two full listens through and certain songs on this CD are downright stunning! Big River being my favorite, a song that can easily stand with the best ever! Eddie is absolutely smoking throughout and Diamond Dave somehow pulls it off in a big way. I had super low expectations going in to this and had not purchased a Van Halen CD since 5150. They are firing on all cylinders, massively exceeding expectations. This is truly some of the most refreshing, solid, rock n roll to come out in a long, long time. One comment on the mastering, yes possibly it could have been done better but this in no way &#34;ruins&#34; the album. It sounds great on my Sony MDR headphones and incredible in my car as well! I cannot understand how anyone could rate this lower than 4 or 5 stars! If you like old classic Van Halen you will love this! Turn it UP!!!!  EDIT: I have to drop this one to three stars and that is probably being kind. The sound on this is borderline pathetic which really detracts from the enjoyment. The excitement of having new Val Halen has worn off and now I am left to ponder what could have been a really fine album if someone know what the hell they were doing in the studio. This does not sound as bad as Death Magnetic or maybe Vapor Trails but waaaaaaaaaay under par. Remix needed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and very addictive. My 3 yo loves it. Heck I can't put this game down!!  Jjust wish it didn't take so many coins to keep playing. SO MUCH FUN!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I LOVED this book. The story it tells is fascinating. The characters are vividly portrayed and the ideas focused on are so original and thought provoking. Card sets the story up with a mystery that needs solved basically, and the story that unfolds is incredible, I think.<br /><br />Speaker for the Dead (and the two books that follow: Xenocide and Children of the Mind) are not like Ender's Game. I feel like Ender's Game was an \\"easier\\" read. It didn't tell as detailed of a story and the concepts presented aren't as inventive. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ender's Game. But Speaker for the Dead kind of blew my mind!<br /><br />Just a note, if you don't like Speaker for the Dead, you won't like Xenocide or Children of the Mind. They continue the same time line of events and deal with a lot of the same people and concepts.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This movie is so adorable. Out of all of this director's movies this isn't one that's in my top five favorites, but it is still really good.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|I enjoyed Unknown very much.  It was suspenseful and full of action.  It kept you guessing what was going on for most of the picture.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Absolutely love Sylvia Day!!  can't believe I don't know how long I am going to wait to find out where this story goes.  I have fallen in love with each and every character in this series.  Praise to Sylvia!
B00957T6X6|5.0|If you think the HBO series is elaborate and addicting, just wait until you read the books! The depth of imagination is incredible making them so much fun to read. Trust me, you won't want to put them down!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Lot's of fun to play and it's very challenging as you progress to higher levels. This game is definitely worth the download!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It helps kill time when I am board. The graphics are good too. Thanks.
B0064W67IM|1.0|It's not a book - it's a comic that is impossible to look at/read on the Kindle. A waste of money.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|very real, gracefully done, shows the ins and outs of modern day social media. I also like catfish the TV Show.
B000I8ERVC|5.0|Great movie a snapshot of an era. It really captures how it was back in those days and the mindset of the youth of that day.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I had this game for only two days, and it totally went out on me! I liked it, but now I can't play it any more. I would not get this game!
1451697686|1.0|I have not read the book, just a recent review. That said, wouldn't it make sense to have this book on Kindle versus paperback when the point of the book is to minimize waste and protect the enviroment?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|everything about Downton Abbey is top notch!!! There needs to be more of this type of exceptional programming  on TV.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Sean Bean is at his best as Lord Starke. He brings depth and honor to the charactor he portrays in Game of Thrones, just wish he had survived the first season. He is one of our favorite actors. I rank his performances in acting along with Sean Connery.
B00471TLZS|5.0|My sisters and I used to rent this movie every weekend when we were very young.  I am not sure why our parents never bought it (since they spent much more renting it over the years), but I finally decided that I should purchase it on dvd.  Although we watched it as young children, there really are some disturbing parts that may be too much for little ones (someone pulling their face off in clumps, maggots in half eaten food, etc.).  Everyone else should see this though.  Poltergeist really is my idea of a perfect scary movie.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I think of all the Angry Birds games, Star Wars are the worst!! My children still liked it, but there were way less levels and the abilities of the new birds made the game &#34;not fun&#34; to play.  Keep your money!!
B004L3AQFG|4.0|I'm happy with this movie. Sure this probubly would've made a good episode of I Shouldn't Be Alive but I feel going for the feature was better as we wouldn't have the bonding moments with Aron and learn about his past life. James Franco delivered a great preformance as usually a character in Aron's situation would feel completly useless, Franco actually gave Aron a very smart persona in addition to his reckless side.<br /><br />I'm also impressed at how well Franco was able to change Aron's personality on camera because that is not an easy task. I make videos where I talk about stuff and it is fairly hard to change your emotions as you generally fit into one type of personality which is hard to break. The fact that Franco was able to do it without too much time passing by was amazing to me.<br /><br />Dislikes I had were that some of the flashbacks were a little unclear as to their purpose, some of Aron's ramblings are hard to make out if you don't have subtitles and the title makes it seem like Aron was trapped in the canyon for five days, when I think that is actually the total amount of time the film takes place in, so Aron was really only trapped for about four days.<br /><br />Other then that, I recommend you rent/stream the movie if you have an interest. This isn't the safest movie to risk a blind buy.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister and Kit Harington as Jon Snow, have become the charactors to watch. I can not wait unitil I can get the season 3.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I watched it on Netflix and knew I had to own it.  I have not read the book, but as a standalone movie it is great!  Coming of age, finding yourself, being true to yourself... all good themes.  There are some dark moments, but it's also heartwarming and funny.  There are some tough themes that might not be appropriate for younger viewers without proper discussion (child molestation, suicide, etc.).  One of my favorite movies.
B00821OX98|4.0|An over used genre that somehow still seems fresh. I like! Aliens, freedom fighters, guns, explosions ... What more do you need?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I found this game very fun,exciting and very relaxing too. Plus I found it very helpful to me since it have 101 games in 1, I dont have to download a lot of games.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love it. I can't wait for the next book. Steamy, obsessive love stories are my thing and this did not disappoint. I am waiting for the happy ever after part.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|To have a large calculator like this on my Kindle brings me fast access easily. I use it a lot and it's all I've ever needed. Thank you.
B005KP778S|5.0|At the heart of the story is the theme &#34;see a need, fill a need&#34; which required its hero to fight for what he believes in.  The included music video did not match the story...in fact I have no idea why that video was chosen.<br /><br />Its a family movie but its just not for super young kids. II think it has a great message for them.  The cast of voice talent was great.<br /><br />It includes blu-ray/dvd and itunes digital copy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When I started playing Despicable Me Minion Rush I thought the quests on it would be easy but they were harder than I expected. Some of them can be quite challenging. That is why I love the game.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|I HAVE ENJOYED EACH AND EVERY EPISODE.<br />I WANT MORE, MORE, MORE.<br />SO HARD TO NOT KEEP WATCHING.<br />WOULD RECOMMEND.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|It's almost, if not better than the first! Jaden is an awesome actor and the storyline was interesting for my four year old.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|It is an ok game..sometimes the game calls for more points than it gives and I do not spend any money on these games.  So for just wasting time it is an ok game to play.
B004XIVQ7Q|5.0|The continuing record of the families involved and the effects of the power and political struggles had on those families and how they coped.  Following a recent tour through south west England it was interesting to note Stonehenge, the Cathederals and Castles that are the remaining symbols of power, control and authority of this past era and wonder what legacy we are leaving from the times we live in. What will future generations find interesting?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched every season completely.  I enjoyed it so much I didn't want it to end.  Can't wait to see what happens next.  This is just my kind of movie.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This is the best movie of the year...so far. Watched it three times and can't wait for the Blu-ray to be released. Lots of action and the best 3D movie I have ever seen. The space scenes in 3D were awesome.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|I was not a fan of the movie. I thought it was going to be better. I was bored it was ok.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I loved it until it stopped working I re downloaded it and it still would not work. I still like it
0684824906|5.0|A team of rivals is the quintessential work for the most important American to have ever lived. Doris kearns Goodwin puts her presidential historian career to its peak use in crafting the rise of Abraham Lincoln and his rivals for the presidential election of 1860. She shows a man who brings together his opponents to help our country in the biggest crisis it has ever faced to date and together bring the country through to a path for a better future at the great sacrifice of all who were involved. If I could I would make every American read this book to show that we have made great sacrifices before and come so far, and I would make every politician read this book so they can see what real governing and compromise looks like. If you love history, your country, and your freedom, I urge you to read this book and see how we as a people can change(FOR THE BETTER) through great leadership, friendship, and compromise.
B0091REZMW|3.0|this game seems to go on and on even if you don't buy $ or diamonds but I'm not sure I'm getting anywhere.  It's just strange!!
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|I chose it mostly for the story line and the actors making it so real with the feelings they put into their parts.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|Awesome movie! One of my favorites!!! It's great for all ages. I could watch this movie over and over and never get bored.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|I love the Lego movies that they've done! My kids love them as well! The downside to this one is that if you own the Lego Batman 2 video game, you've already seen all of this. They took the animated parts from the game and made a movie out of it. Kind of like ringing the water out of that towel to get every last drop out of production cost if you ask me... I still give it a 5 star because it's funny and great for kids of all ages... (my age being 35.)
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a wonderfully touching read.  The characters are believable.  The &#34;language&#34; of flowers is very enlightening. I loved it.
B007P06DJK|5.0|I saw the 25th anniversary film on PBS and had to buy it. Takes me back many years. One of the best albums ever made.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all 3 books. However, there were times I got bored. There were too many times that the same thing was being said over and over. So, the story dragged on.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I wanted to purchase the movie, not just rent it.  Funny, cute, silly, and enjoyable are just a few words to describe it.  Kid safe.  Recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game always crashes in the loading screen then just won't let me play again plus I got pretty far. Get temple run 1 and 2 it's much better
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The ninth incarnation of everyone's favorite time lord is a must see for any science fiction fan out there today, whether you are British or not everyone will enjoy the adventures of this lone wanderer from Galifrey!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I'm soo hooked on this show. Every time I watch it I'm always left wanting more! Can't wait for season 6!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I go to the gym 4/5 times a week but this a totally different level. I was in pain (good pain) after the 1st session of level 1 30 mins. Today, 3 days after the 1st session I am going to do it for the second time. I believe it does work! The workouts are &#34;easy&#34;, anybody could do them.
1439153663|4.0|Hard to read in parts.  I feel like it is pretty true to the life lived by slaves.  So glad all that is over.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|One very imaginative film with some actors playing several roles.  I had to watch it a second time to really catch the &#34;flow&#34;.  Definitely do not try  to just watch it once.  This one is an experience.
0312323867|5.0|Great book easy read. It's your typical chic lit. I love Emily's style of writing and she keeps you guessing.
B000L53D4O|4.0|This is the second one purchase by my wife and I as grandparents. The grand-kids seem to enjoy it as an interactive toy as well as a walker.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|You would think that this app would come with the Kindle FIRE HD. Well, it doesn't. And like everything else with Kindle and Amazon, you are going to pay for the really good stuff. Having said that, I can't say enough good things about the app. I've never taken the time to write a review before but I really felt like this app is worthy of my time. Customer reviews are what make or break a contemplated purchase for me. So, I'd sing like to say, get this app!  It does what it says it will do, even the verbal reminders of your battery life if you choose that setting (took me by surprise the first couple of times).  It is dependable, accurate and is a life saver. I don't know how I managed before I got it. I DEPEND ON THIS APP!  Get it!  You won't be sorry you did.
0316247545|5.0|I willfully admit it. I got this for myself. My daughter like to look through it with me. But yeah, this is mine and I like it. Full of interesting things about the show and full Season 1-3 episode guide.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I love this game! I even have it on my iPhone, but the game keeps foreclosing!!!! Is it just me? Am I the only person having this problem??? Please fix this problem!!!!
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I had never watched this, I was missing one of the best comedies on tv!  Thanks to my step mother, I'm now on to a great show
B007PT1PEY|5.0|There are illustrations inside, and very good layout. Also 'x-ray' function will give you a lot of useful information. I strongly recommend this edition.
0307891402|5.0|I love Skyrim and wanted to get the Collectors Edition of the guide. This is great (obviously pre-DLC content) the guide is comprehensive and the appendix maps in the back are nicely detailed.
B0035O66CO|5.0|I'm happy it's on DVD.  It's such a cute touching movie.  if you haven't seen it yet - you should!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing story of survival in a crazy world.  I couldn't put it down!!!  One exciting event after another kept me holding on to this story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It's way different from the movie. I prefer the book. I would recommend it to all my friends who haven't read it yet. GO HUNGER GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000EXZI14|5.0|It was what I expected. I saw the concert on PBS. It's nice to have their last concert together. I bought it for a friend so I find it difficult to give an opinion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am always looking for apps that will keep me busy for at least days and I have finally found one. I love horses. please I beg you get this app. it is awesome
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Loved the action and all of the characters! We had seen the individual movies for the characters and had enjoyed them. You might want to see &#34;Thor&#34; right before this movie because it is a cliff hanger that leads right into this one. The evil character from &#34;Thor&#34; is the primary bad guy in this one and this movie is the resolution for &#34;Thor&#34;. This movie was most fun when the characters bantered back and forth, and got even funnier when they weren't getting along well. The characters embodied their roles well, were attractive and believable. The action scenes were spectacular! Awesome other dimensional monsters!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is an amazing story. It is very well written, captivating and engaging from the first epison of season 1. I highly reccommend this series!
B00DHNAQ2Y|4.0|It wasn't as campy as the original film but if you like the original you'll like the remake. I especially like how they payed homage to the Evil Dead films by showing the original car. I noticed it when the main female character sat on it while lighting a cigarette.
0765334798|4.0|Redshirts is a very quick and enjoyable read . I discovered Scalzi about a year ago with Old Mans War and was introduced to his wit with his acceptancefor the Hugo Award for short stories . The video is awesome. Back to Redshirts the novel was very well done. Did not think it was worthy of a Hugo Award nominee but I enjoyed it immensely. The idea of the 3 Visas actually made the book for me . Get the book it will be a good beach read.
B006QV30JU|2.0|We are from that era and remembered it as a great movie. I must have seen it as a teenager. My husband and I couldn't get through the corniness of it. Either we have become snobs after all these years or it is no longer timeless, but a dated classic. We ourselves may have become out dated classics, but after the first few songs we realized we could not bear another one!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was very good sometimes it was predictable but sometimes had great surprises. Overall I would recommend this book. It has the right balance of loving romance and very hot romance.
B00ADZCDKM|5.0|I was watching a promo for the second season of HBO's \\"The Newsroom\\". I had never heard of Tom Odell, but HBO was playing his  \\"Can't Pretend\\" over the promo. I went online to identify the song and singer. I bought the cd based on that one song, however, I love it beginning to end. He's a wise singer/songwriter beyond his years. I highly recommend his music. It's dramatic, unpredictable, at times sad and moody, but always engaging. I hope he has success in the USA.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game.  Wish a lot of this were better, . But also in all it is fun to play
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|It didn't work. Got it for my grandkids who like such characters. No explanation for its failure ever appeared so I trashed it.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|Every now and again a watch from Invicta comes out and I cannot simply fathom the low prices they command with the looks they have.<br />I realise that the Invicta $MSRP price is really no indication on what the watch actually sells for. I've found most of the models sell for 20-30% of the original $MSRP.<br /><br />This watch may not have Swiss movements but it makes up for it with a beautiful crown, dial and sub-dials. The bezel is beautiful, in fact I cannot fault the watch in any way cosmetically and aesthetically.<br /><br />This watch is almost a Rolex Daytona Replica and I have been stopped and asked if it was a Daytona, although I would absolutely love a Rolex I can't afford the $20,000 that a Daytona commands.<br /><br />Invicta have thus produced a very pleasing time piece, it looks the part and the movement isn't terrible, for the price I would challenge you to find a better watch, it would be difficult, especially in this price range.<br /><br />Invicta has done the \\"Speedway\\" range justice and the watch itself is very handsome.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I had never seen Cars before and my nephew had me rent it on my Kindle & I loved it :)
B009CG29RK|4.0|Fun movie for all. The minion are hysterical and gru is evil genius with a heart of gold. Can't wait to see number 2.
B000MKD9P6|3.0|Naive would-be reporter from the corn belt adapts to fast paced life in the big Apple. A light comedy centering on the female CEO of a fashion magazine is flawed by characters hard to believe. The CEO (played by Streep) is one-dimensionally evil  and unfailingly brutal with her staff. That she would hire an inexperienced young woman with no sense of contemporary fashion is beyond belief. The fawning behavior of the latter is believable as is her struggle to decide whether to stay in this game, risk losing a man who tries to love her, or move on. I did laugh a few times but learned nothing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game it its better than &quot;TEMPLE RUN 2&quot; i think u would like this as much as i had when i got this app i give u 100% ratings .
B000SEGUDE|4.0|&#34;Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies.&#34; &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34;, by David Mitchell, is a book of genius. And just like a genius, it is brilliant and revolutionary; it is inspired and obstinate; it is visionary and fractious. And while reading it, you must pay close attention to the characters, the setting, and the plot (sound like an English teacher, don't I?). Don't read a section, put it down for a few days, and then come back to it; you'll probably have difficulty picking up the proverbial thread again. This series of interrelated stories is like climbing a mountain (apt metaphor, as you'll see if you choose to read this book), covering many lands and time periods, including a post-apocalyptic future. Truth be told, I saw the movie first, which was confusing enough but absolutely splendid (the movie jumbled the six stories of the book together, as opposed to the book where the stories were told separately, with occasional references to an event in another story). With the movie, I was introduced to the story, and the book clarified the details in the movie. Now I plan to watch the movie again. So that's my recommendation: watch the movie, read the book, watch the movie again. I really love the book and the movie, but the story is very dense, you need to pay close attention.
0920668364|1.0|I had to buy this for my grown daughter and son - you don't have to be young to enjoy the words.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Lone Survivor is a raw recollection of heroism in epic proportion! If you love America and her soldiers you will absolutely love Lone Survivor!
B004UID2LC|3.0|only offers you flv videos.dont really care for it i can get flv videos any time i want on my home pc
B00821OX98|5.0|There is more emphasis on character development than on glitzy special effects. While the effects are really good, it is not the foundation of the show. Really worth a watch.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|THis is a really good movie.. My 6 year old will watch this everyday. He loves it.. Its a great movie.
B002RI9UBS|1.0|I found this book incredibly boring and completely overrated.  Couldn't bother finishing it.  I likened it to The Emperor's New Clothes.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|the best all around video uploader ive seen on a app,lets you have official videos and uploads fast and easy,loving this app
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was challenging but I was able to complete. You definitely have to figure out the clues to progress to the next level.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Certain parts of this book made me cry and I just was so involved in this book &#60;3 it can't wait to read more Nicholas sparks books
0823015033|5.0|I've briefly gone through the book and have found it to be one of the best books I've seen and bought.  It is for both the beginner, like myself, and those on a more experienced level.  She explains everything well and doesn't confuse you while doing so.  I look forward to the projects in this book.  I have some natural ability, but nothing like what I see in this book.  I am in awe of her talent.
B004GYY714|5.0|i love it it offers me everything i want out of music,all stations in my area at my finger tips
B00001NFCY|3.0|it's a good disk just didn't like half of the music on it that much, I do like creed in general though.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Love it, and my friends love it. Great drama, funny, sad, cute, and very compelling.  All the actors are great.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I rated this &#34;I like it&#34; because of the interaction of the characters and the skill of the actors.  I really like Robert Downey, Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow. I couldn't love it because it was just too much of an assault on my senses.  It seems there is a competition these days to see who can blow up more stuff and destroy more buildings in New York City.  Having just watched the new Superman movie, I have had my fill of violence and special effects for a very long time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like the fact that you were able to figure out the puzzles yourself without having to look  for  cheats.  I was sad to find out there were only a few levels. I finished them all in one sitting!!!  Please more levels!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a great way to pass the time, I get lost playing this gsme.  I have told several people about thus game and they are loving it too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|one of the best free games ever download it and share it with all of your friends fun fun fun fun!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The only unnerving element to me was the capacity for violence and meanness by the cute little minions.  They seem so sweet and cuddly, otherwise.  The little girls are adorable.  Steve Carell was brilliant.
0736092269|5.0|With Strength Training Anatomy, a picture really is worth 1000 words. Each page features an illustration of an exercise being performed, with the targeted muscles drawn in red and labeled.  Most of the exercises use either free weights or a weight-training machine; there are some exceptions, such as crunches.  Each page also includes written instructions.<br /><br />Some pages include sketches showing variations of the exercise. For example, the Angled Leg Press page explains how the emphasis on targeted muscles changes with feet high on the plate, feet low on the plate, feet wide apart, and feet close together.<br /><br />The exercises are organized into seven sections: arms, shoulders, chest, back, legs, buttocks, and abdomen.  This makes it easy to thumb through and select a workout routine that targets the areas you want to work on that day. There are a variety of exercises in each section, providing options to vary your routine for a more balanced approach.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Very addictive. Keeps your mind sharp. Your not rushed or on a time limit like many other games. Can't wait for new rooms.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I looked  at many apps to be able just to perform the basics but this by far is the best.<br /><br />You can edit this in any way that you would do on the more expensive apps. Only this is more simply labeled out for people to edit there photos to turn everything into a peice of art!
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|great movie and concert it was really good and it was really a good story. the music was great! yeah
B000ID37RM|5.0|Not much to say about this that hasn't been said  I saw the movie years ago.  I recently re-read the book and wanted to see the movie again.  It is told beautifully and Gregory Peck is, of course, his wonderful Oscar-winning self in it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great alarm clock with nice music for alarms. It has a dimmer for the clock face.Which make it not too bright to keep you awake
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty good graphics and super fun and addicting! Some glitches when I played on my phone but none on my kindle!
B00CFSWMYM|4.0|This album is definitely a grower and at first listen I was a bit disappointed, but after their first AMAZING album I was going to give them a fair chance.  And now after a few weeks, I keep coming back to it.  It's not a classic, but it's still very good.  Apart from the very forgettable track 2, it's a really well-sequenced album with a nice beginning, intermission, and end.  I'm going to try to see them live in a few weeks.<br /><br />My highlights:<br /><br />What we Done - Very nice, really builds into something<br />Sleep - Definition of grower, I just love that opening riff, great sound<br />Painful Like - Was an instant fan<br />Hurt Me now - Another instant standout<br />Home - The first song we heard, definitely different from before<br /><br />*Note:  I promise I'm a real person, I have no agenda, and I was not paid by anyone to write this review.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|It was ok, because it was a 3D movie it detracted some of the special effects I could not get.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Great book. Only half way through. will let you know when I am finished One of her best book I have read so far.
B00821OX98|5.0|I really enjoy Falling Skies: great story and great plot development. It's not just an action series: it explores some of the deepest aspects of human experience: family, loss, hope, providence, and faith.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love because it is very easy to use. The size also is very helpful for those who may need large displays.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|If you are feeling there has to be more to life than; go to college, get a job, wash your car on Saturdays, retire and die muttering ‘youth is wasted on the young’, then buy this book.<br /><br />James Altucher has not just stumbled in business a few times but fallen flat on his face in cow dung but has still come up smelling of roses. He made choices some were bad and some were fantastic. By sharing his experiences, he challenges mainstream thinking in a fun way and gives practical steps of how to live a freer more fulfilled life without having to be a pauper or a hippy.<br /><br />Choose Yourself is a starters guide to cutting the crap out of your life and having the confidence to living the life you want.<br /><br />Rosie ([...]
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazon account of the chamber music video parodies would like to see her soaking up to unlock characters and daughter of history
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We had caught season 3 on TV and were pleased to see that we could catch up with season 1 and 2 with our Amazon Prime service. Enjoyable!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My pony  is very pretty and super awesome. I like to pet my pony and feed my pony and do @ bunch of other  stuff
B002MCYWHG|5.0|My little girl (3 years old) and I are loving this seat.  We ride all over the place.  She's comfortable and I'm comfortable.  I love being able to have her there in front so we can talk to each other.  I also feel more secure having her there as opposed to behind me or in a bike trailer.  Great product.  We are having a ball.  Highly recommended.  At first when I opened the box, I thought, No way is she going to fit in that tiny seat.  But I was wrong.  She fits just fine and is all snug and cozy.  So happy we made the purchase.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|There is a lot of people out there who would LOVE this game! It is a great exercise for your brain and it`s very fun!
0792844890|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I absolutely love it!  Mel Brooks is one of my heroes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft because creepers and zombies and animals and we can build all kinds of stuff so thank you Mojang.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Bland, not very good I think it's crap I have to write 20 or more words. I really just wanted to rate this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I am satisfied with this game I love minecraft but the lit version stinks this game is worth the $7
B004R0WKNE|5.0|Rachel McAdams is such a delight and her zealous, eagerness to succeed works like charm in this character.  Plus, Harrison Ford is pure gold in his role. Highly recommend.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|It is an true portrait of how Blacks were treated. There is nothing more to say. I will order more DVD
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|It was very predictable. Once again I'm annoyed I have to write 20 or more words to rate this move.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is extremely useful. I am a huge Temple Run 2 fan. It is a lot better than the 1st Temple Run! Congratulations, you manufactured and made a perfect application
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Not just eye candy, you need to pay attention as 6 stories over hundreds of years and realities all end up blending seamlessly to one climax.  The reuse of many actors in different roles across story line was terrific.  Well worth spending the time to see.
B000C7HMF2|4.0|As I have stated before I like ordering books. Books help keep your mind active. That is all I Have to say.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book kept me interested and couldn't wait to finish it. I watched the series and the book is way more entertaining
0486284735|5.0|I have watched the movie first and then went to Barns and Noble and bought the book and event though the language was a little hard i loved it so much i have read it twice!!! Amazing story!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great season! For days after watching the final episode my wife was fretting the fate of a certain character. Can't wait for season 4.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|My New Best Friend..this App just took my Tablet<br />Into a Permanent and Daily Used Gear &amp; I DJ 4 Real<br />This is Fun and Amazing for all Bravo to BBT creative<br />Crew for this one.  And Free.. Love You For This App!
B00BEXB18M|4.0|It's different yes,but you can't expect another rust in peace or peace sells,and countdown.They want to experiment and that's fine,and I think this album is really good. I'm a hardcore megadeth fan so yea im being bias,but other than what I've said,I believe this album is good.For any hardcore megadeth fans who stay true and will follow a band no matter what changes they make then by all means buy this album.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had a lot of fun playing this game! Can't wait for more rooms to become available.<br />The game is highly addictive!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My son, who has excellent taste in books, recommended I read Wool.  I decided to try the free first chapter.  I was hooked right away, and through the Kindle store from my device - I bought the Omnibus Edition.  Now I've finished that, and I want more.  Hugh Howey spins a tale that is hard to put down with well drawn characters you just KNOW and care for in situations that are easy to picture while being hard to imagine.  I want more of this series, and now I know I want to read more by this author.  EXCELLENT READ!
B004UID2LC|4.0|good for music videos or just music doesn't work for long videos or movies stops working some times download now
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|the only shortfall is I don't want to pay any money for the extras so everything is just basic play and it takes too long to earn a lot of money
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I liked the game but  got tired of the Facebook stuff popping up its something fun to do in your spare time
B002KVSJ64|5.0|I absolutely love anything by Breaking Benjamin. This is such a great release. Wish I would have downloaded much sooner.
B005UD1D62|5.0|This book was really good.. I cant wait to read the 2nd book. I like that it went off the series that she had written before.
B004VFN72S|4.0|....it didn't disappoint. Weaver was very good in one of several roles that have shown her range. She can be that tough as nails heroine (Alien Series) or this lady who is very vulnerable but still possessing an inner strength. Great performance from Holly Hunter and solid turns by Mulroney,  Patton and Connick Jr. round out a nice cast in a very cool modern day thriller.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I liked the app but I got tired of the Facebook popups its something fun to do in your spare time
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I did not want to see this movie because I usually dislike musicals, but a friend of mine rented it and made me promise to have an open mind. I watched it and ended up loving it! It is absolutely hilarious. It reminded me of a mixture of Bridesmaids (little cleaner) and Mean Girls. I, in turn, made my sister who also hates musicals and singing-movies watch it. She laughed throughout the entire movie, too.<br /><br />This is a movie that is funny without trying too hard to be. The highlight of the story for me is definitely Rebel Wilson.<br /><br /> I do not recommend this movie for young children or pre-teens, though. It is a little cruder than I expected. But, I am 21 so it is appropriate for me!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved season 3. So nice to be able to watch it all at one time. I spent a wonderful day enjoying each episode.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Have used and loved this app for almost 2 years.  With the new update it is no longer the great easy to use, excellent information app it once was.  Don't need giant glaring pictures.  All I want oz the weather in an understandable easy to use format.  Am deleting the weather channel and switching yo weatherbug effective immediately.
B001EBWIPE|5.0|It's a classic movie, one that just never gets old.  I 've watched many times before yet still find it very entertaining.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is very addictive. I love playing it because it's simple but challenging at the same time. The background music is soothing.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Not only are Follett's 20th century novels historically accurate, they are intriguing page-turners.  They are long, but I finished them both within a couple of weeks because you cannot put them down.  His characters are unforgettable and the story is so full of incidents that are so perfectly developed and culminated, you &#34;live&#34; them.  He is a deft storyteller with descriptions that enable the reader to &#34;see&#34; the settings and intriguing characters the reader will not soon forget.
B0053FANQS|5.0|I like all the fast and furious movies and now I have all but one (the new one) good Movie
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|I am a musician, I play guitar as well as produce electronic music. The music I make is always very ambient and chill, because this is exactly what I want to hear. The music Boards of Canada put out in Tomorrow's Harvest is the exact type of music I aspire to make myself, the difference being that they are significantly better at it. The feelings put into this music is amazing, and is great for listening to when you are sitting around relaxing (or anytime for that matter).<br /><br />The quality of music is so good that it astounds me that such a large quantity is packed into this album and is being sold for only $7. The album is over an hour long, definitely more bang for the buck than I was expecting. It is definitely worth picking such a quality album.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|My 8yr old loves this game. I think that it's a more age appropriate version of the temple run games. This can be played for a long time.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|We gave this as a gift for an avid golfer.  We have not yet heard how he likes it, but we're sure he will love it.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is a great movie something I would recommend to anyone and if you love horse's you will love this story
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|More good songs from everyones most favorite hipster band. Diane Young is an insane earworm of a song. Nuff said.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game I  very fun. When I went on a road trip and it still worked. This is a very fun app.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I earnestly beg Mr. Follett to write another 14th century novel.  I loved Pillars and the World Without End.  They are addictive, and when there are no more Ken Follett 14th century books to read, I have terrible withdrawals. I believe Follett owes us more.  He is a terrific storyteller, and I cannot put his books down.  Great, engaging &#34;good&#34; characters and intriguing, actually somewhat likeable villains.  He comes up with incredible story lines that will keep you reading no matter how tired you are.  Thanks, Ken Follett, but, please, more.
B0053FANRC|4.0|If you like drifting this is the movie for you, still a good movie even though the originals aren't in it only one at the end
B00AWQEKIK|3.0|A lot of the tracks sound quality not real good............ after reading booklet (by Graham Nash and..) I was expecting much more............. The CSN (Y) tracks were good (obviously) and like his version of Leeshore but was expecting to be blown away but was not
B0041VT6HW|1.0|Surprisingly enough the story was darn good. Not exactly what I expected. Was very glad I bought it. Next time I won't let the reviews sway me.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The USB plug goes into theUSB port of my I-pod shuffle charger and the mini plug of the cord I purchased plugs into my Kindle and it charges my kindle perfectly.......Arthur  Bossin
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Glad that this game is now available for android, works very well on Kindle Fire HD. Sad that online multiplayer is not available, hope that it's coming soon (would otherwise be 5 stars)
B008K6HN8I|4.0|At first it was difficult to understand exactly what I was supposed to do, but now that I have used it for a little while, good product.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun! I love it. It's a lot like Subway Surfers, but a little cooler. Plus, it's free! You can't lose with this game.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is ok but I would like stuff to be cheaper<br />It would make it a lot easier to get vehicles
B0062NAX1U|5.0|i cant believe this movie it is fantasic i will watch itover and over again i cried when i watched it
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The Panther is a great read for those who enjoy thrillers with irreverent wit. It was a mostly believable account of a special force team trying to avenge the murder of seamen aboard the SS Cole in Yemen several years ago. The main character, John Corey, is the one with the wit and I found myself laughing out loud at his clever, albeit sometimes dark humour. My only criticism is that the plot is a little drawn out at times...a little long.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|tried it and it works better than the original cord that came with it. my kindle is a yeard old
B00499NHLC|5.0|The show has a bit of everything- witty banter, mystery, simply fun, except more episodes! I need more! I'm addicted to Sherlock!
B002N83H52|3.0|A most informative piece of writing about a man whose obsession cost him his well-being. I love books, have written them and have had them published.  I also collect autographed first editions, so I know about how easy it can be to come under the influence books have.  For this reason, I am now an e-book only person.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Thank you amazon for having this on your prime membership list. I'm hooked. I would rather watch on my computer or kindle then TV any day.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a wonderful series. Don't miss it. Covers the period after WWI - the families are sorting things out and the dynamics are intriguing as always.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It kept me continuously wondering what would be the outcome! I like how the author blended the first two books with the third. This book is by far not sappy. It's full of twists and turns revolving around the main characters. If you like a powerful political ending, you'll enjoy this book!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this is such a wonderful way to watch any series. no commercials and you can watch as little or as much as you want. Love my kindle and love amazon.
159463176X|5.0|I have not read this book, but really enjoyed his other books, and I am sure the same will be true for this book.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Awesome case for the price! I like it a lot. Protects my iPhone 4s very well, though i have to take off the case to put it on my station.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|Still a classic!! Great movies.. Wish there was a way for another set of these...can't wait for more..  Use the force!!
B003VANOFY|4.0|Nice surround sound except that it fluctuates if you have multiple programs running which is very annoying at times. Sounds great when it works properly though. The headset is quite awkwardly large and a bit heavy but it has amazing signal and range, battery dies fairly fast on decent use but the charging cable is quite long and scares me sometimes that I might damage the USB port because its a little awkward to put in. However, I do like the G-buttons that let me pause/skip songs on iTunes no matter what game I'm paying or where I am in my house.
B004H4XAXO|5.0|Vividly described and with enough character sophistication to be it's own world, looking forward to reading the next one Sanderson puts out to this series.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was initially upset when Google Reader decided to close shop. Because many trusted reviewers recommended Feedly, I decided to give it a try. I have been very impressed with the application. It does exactly what I want it to do and is easily customized. As an IT professional, though, I have been more impressed by the agile methodologies and transition change management performed by Feedly. They were given a huge opportunity (and a huge increased end User base) and they rocked it.
B008GJV2OA|5.0|5 stars for this brilliantly dark comedy. I'm a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick and being able to watch one of his earlier films on Amazon Prime is pretty wonderful. Peter Sellers is a HUGELY underrated actor.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A good read but with a few stale parts. I kinda had to push myself through those but the rest was good.
1400069289|4.0|A not so quick but thorough read.  I really enjoyed this book, and I'm sure many people will as well as long as you're not above it.<br /><br />This books would best educate, young Marketeers, MBA students or just students in general.  It gives you some insight on why people do the things that they do, and with that you'll have a wide array of examples and situations where the humans naturally fall into an almost mindless routine - examples that can be used towards some business decisions.<br /><br />If you're read any of Malcolm Gladwell's books, you'll find a lot of similarities among these books. Only thing is Gladwell does it better.<br /><br />Overall I'd definitely recommend this book to my friends.  I'll even send a copy to my old Marketing Professor - he always used to talk about his time at Proctor & Gamble, so I'm sure he'll be delighted to find that a chapter is dedicated to the brand.
B0093X805W|5.0|Ronald Dahl is one of my favorite childhood authors and now that I am a mother I am able to share my love for Dahl's creativity and imagination with my son.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome!!!!! Your brain is always thinkng of what to do,and u get really excited.. For anyone trying this game you will have a  blast!!!!!!
B001NEXEEG|5.0|Typical portrayals by Wayne and Jimmy Stewart - tough guy who has a heart of gold, and the straight laced man forced to the brink by the evil Liberty. Gripping end to end, with significant roles for minorities - it really stands the test of time.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is one of the best series on television.  Just when you get attached to a character or plot,  creator Julian Fellowes throws you a curve. I've watched all 3 seasons several times and never tire of finding something new each time.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I'd give it ten stars if I could.  It's moving, relevant and brilliant in subtle ways.  I'm not young and let me say that rap is not my preferred genre. It's not even second or third, but this is art with some rap mixed in and the rap is meaningful and understandable. Macklemore uses real words and the listener can understand them.  So, if rap is not your thing, please don't just pass this over based on what you think it must be.  Go find a track or two to listen to.  You'll be back for the cd.<br />I really can't fully explain with words everything I'd like to..some things are beyond.  But true art makes you feel an emotion and this cd will surely do that. Maybe more than one emotion.  I feel like I know Ben and Ryan on a first name basis now and I know myself a little better too.  Further, in the same way Rush is rock for intellectuals, I believe that Macklemore has brought us rap for intellectuals. I don't see how you could fail to love it, but no matter what you should listen to it. I promise it will make you feel something AND think about something too.<br />I have nothing but respect for the honesty and mission of the artists who made this cd- other than tremendous gratitude for their bringing this thing of beauty to us.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Amazing read.  Gets you hooked right away. Love the twists and turns. Definitely going to read the rest of the series
B0042XA2U4|1.0|1) The Kindle edition of this book is wonderful.  The book display is easy to read.  The book was seamlessly delivered via the Kindle electronic pathway.  No complaints concerning the digital media edition of this book.<br /><br />2)  After catching pieces of the movie by the same title on tv (starring the lovely Hilary Swank I might add) I decided to purchase this book.  No stranger to reading books that have been made into movies (i.e. The Lord of the Rings, the Twilight saga, Safe Haven, The Devil Wears Prada, Rocket Boys) I knew prior to beginning this book there would be discrepancies between the book's content and the movie's.  Boy was I mistaken!  The only items the book and movie share are some of the main character's names and a connection with Ireland.  Holly is a spoiled, immature, aloof, and bemused widow.  She has no redeeming character traits.  Close behind Holly in acting out childish antics is her younger sister Ciara.  Holly's brothers are just as hard to like as well.<br /><br />All in all save your time and money.  If you enjoyed the movie version of PS I love You stick w/ it.  This book is supremely disappointment.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Though designed for a young audience, my wife and I (both in our 70's) enjoyed it immensely.  Speilberg's special effects always attract me.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I was skeptical,how could it be as good as the t.v.show with the original cast?What a suprise!!I loved it and I have  watched it several times.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I originally purchased this book on a whim after hearing it mentioned in the movie &#34;The Lake House.&#34;  I adore Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice and this book deepens my adoration of the author.  At times the prose drags but true to form in the end the characters meant to be together find their way to one another.  A great read for requirement (i.e. middle school, high school reading lists) as well as enjoyment.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Yes, I made up that word for the title, but it fits!  I did not get around to seeing this movie while it was in theaters and just forgot about it... until now.  And wow! I regret not going to see this on the big screen.  What a good story it was, and AMAZING action!  When Optimus defeats those 2 bad a$$ bad guys with one arm at the end of the film I was in awe.  Of course I would have loved to see Megan Fox in the story, but the new girl is hot as well.
B004H4XLRE|5.0|I bought this for my grandson and he loves it.  He loves to race the cars and he can also store some of his cars in the case.
B0090SI460|5.0|It was fun to watch with the kids.  Younger kids may be afraid at first but there is a child in the movie that isn't afraid and laughs and laughs which makes kids at ease.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|I read this with my heart and recommend it to everyone.  I finally got an understanding of life in its Divine order
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great book! Ken Follett delivers again. If you liked &#34;Pillars of the earth&#34; or &#34;World without end&#34;, you'll enjoy this book for sure. Also, a great book for reviewing your WW I history lessons.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|First book of Nesbo read. Will definitely read more. Harry is a compelling character. At times a bit predictable. If you listen and really read between the lines you can follow  his thought processes and logic that allow him to connect the dots and get his man. Great fun. You really get caught up in the story. Had to read it as much as I could between kids and normal days. Hard to put down
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|3 year old liked playing with it for a short time. I tried it too it was kind of fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this it is lots of fun its cool. Get this app. its addicting. hurry get this app now!!!!!!!!!!!!
1595825045|4.0|Don't get me wrong I love this book however, I wish there was more artwork like turnarounds, gestures and expression's sheets.  Of course I always compare these books with the original Batman animated book which was amazing. Just wish there was more helpful artwork here.  Still is a great book for what it is.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|VERY GOOD RELAXING READING.PLEASE ADVISE WHEN THERE ARE MORE OF THESE BOOKS AVIABLE<br />WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY? I GUESS I AM A KID AT HEART.
B008NEMPTO|3.0|good 3d effects. otherwise movie mildly entertaining but not great art Plot rather goofy. acting is okay.Got it for 3D
B0010358CQ|4.0|It's a good movie, but not as good as Appleseed in my opinion. It expands on the romance between Dunan and Briarios which is nice. If you like Appleseed, you should also have Ex Machina in your colleciton.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|A little confusing at first but stick with it and everything will start to make sense. By the time I started third book I was getting bored but then the book got exciting and I couldn't put it down.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This was my favorite app - until they &quot;improved&quot; it. Ugh!  Pieces are now difficult to move around the screen and tend to stick. Borders show with white edges.  Edges do not adhere to edges of screen. Bring back the old version!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I enjoy reading this series but I felt somewhat disappointed & not satisfied.  I wish this book was longer as it barely touched the surface with the complex storyline.  Hopefully the next book continuing this series will make up for it.
B005DI9906|5.0|Four Feathers was a significant adventure saga, in brilliant color, for its time.<br />The major flaw was that the drawing room scenes early in the film, and again at the end of the film, were obviously shot at the same time.  Thus, the hero, who underwent quite a bit of physical abuse in the story, appears at the end, unscathed.<br />He had undergone planned facial scarring in terms of the burn on  his forehead, along with chemical tanning of his skin, in addition to the natural tanning from several months outside in Egypt and the Sudan.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I am almost 60 years old and outside of The Twilight Zone - Breaking Bad is the BEST television show ever.  I did not like it during the first season, after seeing a couple episodes, because it dealt with drugs.  I abhor drugs.  But now that I've caught up, I realize how brilliant it is.  Read other reviewers if you want the storyline.  I liked Sopranos, Deadwood, Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire, Top of the Lake, and Copper but they are X rated.  I LOVED with all of my heart LOST, X Files, Twin Peaks, Star Trek, I Claudius, Uptown, Downtown, The Outer Limits because they were innovative, clever and not X rated.  This old prude is a convert to Breaking Bad. I LOVE it! It is intelligent and thoughtful.  It is July, 2013 and I'm left with Tommy James and the Shondells \\"Crystal Blue Persuasion\\" (a song really about God's light and the crystal blue Earth we saw photographed from Apollo ships) and Mickey Dolenz's \\"I'm Going' Down\\" spinning in my head. I'm anxiously, and sadly, awaiting the final season.  Like LOST, Twilight Zone, Star Trek, and Mad Men, you will want to watch each episode a few times. The carefully chosen 7-word sentences and incredible acting by Walter White, Jesse, Mike, and Hank will have you hooked.  Just buy the whole series, already!
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|I'll keep it simple. I like movie soundtracks that are emotionally charged epics that I can listed to while reading a good book. I LOVE this soundtrack. One of my favorites. I recommend the Deluxe edition that is download only though as there is a ton more music.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very fun to watch everyday ! Highly recommend if you like aliens and stuff. the plot is realistic enough for the type of series it is.
1574214276|5.0|Release of creative energy into something rewarding and productive where new ideas and wonderful examples and instructions were provided, can't stop playing
B0009S4IKQ|5.0|One of my favorite among the classics.  Great Art Deco sets and a host of well known actors.  I have watched it several times.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|I have a 14-year-old, so I'm no spring chicken.  However, I came across this on Amazon and rented it again and the appeal is still there.  David Spade is classic entitled emperor (No touchee!), Patrick Warburton perfect as the dim-witted (but muscley) Kronk, John Goodman nailed the character of Pacha, and Eartha Kitt was such a delightful surprise as the evil Yzma (Open this door and I'll burn your house down. Kronk: Don't you mean &#34;OR you'll burn the house down?&#34;).<br /><br />Even the kid, who hasn't seen this since he was about 6 or 7, was excited to see it (and of course, he's too cool to be excited about anything;0).
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I purchased this because of reviews I read since Nathan Fillion's success on Castle.<br />I enjoy SiFi and this series is entertaining.<br />I would watch it again, it's just not what I would call a classic.<br />I would call Star Trek & Battlestar Galactica classics:<br />I was a Star Trek (original & next generation) fan.<br />Also liked the original Battlestar Galactica (not the remake where they made Starbuck a female)
B002XUBDVK|4.0|This is a well known film, violent and graphic, well acted.  The sets are spectacular.  I never could understand why Daniell Day Lewis did not win an oscar for his performance.<br />I am unable to tell what the remastered thing adds to the film.<br />I am still waiting for the director's cut to be produced and released.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A great book for my vacation. Hugh Howey manages to not be predictable and I'm going straight for the next book in line.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|I like the movie as a married man of 9 years. Can't really relate with some of the craziness, but I think that it addresses some of the funny  and serious issues that a marriage can go through and makes them all very laughable.
B0080CKGZE|1.0|For a movie that has been remade 10 times, you would think that they could get it right. I actually felt bad for the actors, who weren't great themselves. Nearly unwatchable
B00DU74U74|4.0|This particular movie was not what I expected at all, I guess a lot of us probably went into it with Twilight esq. ideas, although I loved the Twilight series, this movie is wholly unique. It took me till about 45 minutes in to really become immersed in the story but the more I watched the better it got. The female lead is superb and the ending wraps things up while still leaving you wondering what happens next. A creative and enjoyable film!
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Scientifically accurate and taking a new look at the zombie genre to look at the effects on people involved. From military, to scientists, and even average scientists. It does not paint a pretty picture, and is a typical post apocalyptic story, but does not paint a convoluted story about finding a cure, but rather one about people learning to survive in a dire situation!
B00BT1XCOU|2.0|Been fan of HIMYM for a while now and own all of the seasons on DVD, it's sad for me to say this but I'm probably going to skip this one.  Very few relevant episodes and most of them are fillers, some somewhat funny others .. meh.<br /><br />I don't know but I hope they rescue these series for S9 so they can at least end them on a high note.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Love The Good Wife! the characters...the plot lines...can't just watch one at a time...each episode is better than the last!
0062080237|3.0|I enjoyed Gaiman's American Gods, but it was about a hundred pages too long. The way Gaiman incorporates gods from various mythologies is really creative and there are a couple of great twists at the end, but the novel's middle is just too long. Another major problem is that the protagonist, Shadow, is too boring. He is the strong, silent type taken to an extreme of having very little personality until late in the novel. The supporting characters are much more interesting than Shadow. Mr. Wednesday, perhaps the novel's most intriguing character, doesn't get enough screen time. American Gods was good, but needed one more thorough round of editing.
B00CWVFVUE|1.0|I was a fan of the book, they changed SO MUCH, too much! Yuck yuck yuk. Sometimes the book is just so much better and this is one of those times!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|If this was fiction, I would describe it as having well developed characters and a compelling plot.  The story is moving and thought provoking.  It kept my husband, teenage son, and me interested to the end._
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app gives the weather forcast and displays radar screens. The display is clear and the forcast can be displayed hourly if you desire.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Has been VERY helpful in staying with my exercise routine when not going to class. Love the way you can personalize it.
B009AJD5E0|1.0|What a let down this film was for me, as huge big fan of the original Alien franchise I cannot fathom what the creators of this project were shooting for. In the original Alien film it would be understandable that upon being woken up from hypersleep that a crew of miners would be pissed off about having to investigate an unknown \\"signal\\" on an uncharted planet. But on a mission of such massive significance as the Prometheus that we would find such a dysfunctional crew of meatheads an self serving douche bags. Shortly after waking up from an extended sleep the crew look at each other like its the first time they've ever met and one of them trying to be friendly to another gets a response (in a gravely voice) that goes something like... \\"I'm here to make money, not be your friend, so leave me the hell alone...\\" REALLY? A mission of this magnitude and they felt the need to write into the script this totally unbelievable B.S.? They couldn't create enough drama and tension without the need to add this manufactured nonsense into the film?<br />  Well, that was it for me, my suspension of disbelief was gone 15 minutes into the film. Very dissapointing too as this could have REALLY been something to behold, plus coming from my all time favorite director well...all I can say is the next two films really need to shine to mask the stink of this one.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|We have all heard or read similar stories of near death experiences but not from an acclaimed and well known neurosurgeon such as Dr. Alexander.  This fact makes his tale far more believable and absolutely worth reading.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|As usual for Archer, the writing is great, as well as the story, but the story has no ending (as with the last two books in this series). Why must we pay for 3 books, when 1 will do?
B0043RSK3K|4.0|at a time when we are receiving classified information leaked by Snowden, I found this book of great interest.  If what it says is true, it's a wonder we didn't suffer a nuclear attack or initiate one during the cold war.  The lack of security concerning who could have initiated an attack from the US or from the Soviet Union is scary.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|It's a film that puts you there right next to the characters. The quality of the cinematic effects are spectacular. The story is based off what a family of five lived through while on vacation. It is haunting, but beautifully done. When you start watching, you won't be able to stop.
B002GYS1FO|5.0|This is one you will revisit again and again. The original lyrics are outstanding ! This is a must have for any fan.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|This CD of Alicia Keys is really incredible! The tunes flow and ebb, but never wind up sounding homogenous.<br /> Highly recommended!
B005XDHNF4|5.0|I bought this for my cake topper for my wedding cake. We had a small cutting cake and this was the perfect size. It could easily get lost on a bigger cake.<br /> It requires a bit of assembly and can be slightly customized (bride hair color and flowers). The bride also comes with a veil too.
B00005NNMJ|5.0|This is one you will revisit again and again. The original lyrics are outstanding ! This is a must have for any fan.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Well, Peter Jackson and the gang have successfully done it again! That is to say that the origin story of the One Ring that the public at large viewed back in 2001-2003 comes to life once more!
8862933177|5.0|I have a chronic condition that sometimes makes me feel awful and puts me in bed for days at a time. When I have times like that i watch a lot of TV. More recently I got a Roku player so I could enjoy more movies that I have wanted to see. Soon, however, I found that if I watched a movie when I was at my illest I would forget and tried to re-watch the same movies over and over. So now I write down all the movies I watch. I love this journal and the only thing I would do a bit different is put less customized options at the end and a few more lettered tab pages in the front. The only reason I say this is that I seem to have a penchant for movies starting with the letter S and it's already full! I will end up using the customized portion for overflow so it's not a big problem. Basically it just simply means your Moleskine Film Journal will be flexible and grow to be whatever you need it to be!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|sturdy and really protect your camera and accessories. Great. The price is very good also. It is very easy to carry my camera in it and I don't get worried if It is protected.
B002M87W9K|5.0|What can I say, I love this movie! I always have. Great story, wonderful music, the right amount of humor. If you like musicals you'll love the Music Man!
B0045NDVFE|4.0|When this band matures a little (and gets a a grown-up haircut for the guys), they're really going to be a great band.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|It wasn't my pick to read in our book club, but I did like it. i liked seeing how the young deal with fear and the unknown. I felt it was a coming of age to grow and expand your own comfort zone. Easy read. Fun characters.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Its a good game, me and my son can have hours of fun just typing in words to see what will appear in the game.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This is a great thriller. I didn't want to put it down. As of most of Gillian Flynn's books the main characters are incredibly flawed and complex. Yet, you are still able to connect with them so deeply.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|Paul Anka is one of my favorites, back when he was just writing music and not singing. His music is enjoyable. I like to take long drives and love listening to soft music. great buy
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It is this app for the meaning of life and death in your favourite edition of the floor and the other works for the other side effects on the other hand
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I really love this flash for my D90.  I ended up going with this product instead of the SB-910 since it was about half the price and I didn't really need all of the power (or size) of its big brother.  I like how I can use the remote mode to have an off camera light source and I also like that I can purchase another sb-700 in the future and have them all communicate together for more lighting options.  I am still learning how to best use this flash, but so far I really like the results I have been able to achieve give my photos that extra edge that they were lacking before.  I really think that my results look much more professional and I would highly recommend the book &#34;the hot shoe diaries&#34; that I bought along with this flash.  I was completely new to flash photography and it is teaching me a lot.
B0068THAGY|3.0|it was really good at the beginning with a really interesting mystery but at the end it was really common and no good at all
0142000663|5.0|Just wonderful. Not a book you rip through, but if you don't mind taking your time, and it's about the journey, and you like some lush prose, try this, definitely. Also, makes me want to write an epic Grapes of Wrath zombie-novel...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best puzzle game to date!  Unique ideas in a league of its own.  We need new levels bcuz its addictive!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a remarkably fun game. I'm addicted to and play it every day. I recommend this game for everyone.
B007T7MIR0|3.0|When the app starts it has a submit / cancel choice to access DropBox. Nether seems to work. Select them and nothing happens. Don't know if its the screen not responding to touch of the app not knowing what to do with the information.<br /><br />???
1609611543|5.0|Well written with an abundance of information that will alter the way you think about wheat completely. I took a chance, and it changed my life forever. I have struggled losing weight for the past 15 years, so I decided that I had nothing to lose by cutting the wheat out. I lost 15lbs in 3 weeks, and the most amazing part of all is that I don't have any cravings for carbs, especially bread any longer. I used to crave and obsess about bread and cookies, etc with a vengeance and that is all gone. I highly recommend this book.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Great game but definitely needed more levels when initially purchased. Now I'm left waiting for and update to keep playing. Which totally sucks.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|amazing game. like one epic knight and temple run but better. must have app for all ages especially despicable.me fans
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Good acting adds to the telling of how Osama bin Laden was found and killed.  Perseverance, inspired detective work, and luck are what  it  took to eventually overcome the obstacles encountered in hunting bin Laden down. Along the way the viewer sees that the United States did some ugly inhumane things to gather information, just as bad as what we have accused others of doing.  This film makes one think on various levels. Definitely worth watching and riveting in its depiction of what went on during this manhunt.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If your looking for a game that is fun try Subway Surfers. You get to visit different places and complete missions that make you multiplier faster to make your score higher. You can also buy people and motherboards. Try Subway Surfers today
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|My 6 year old plays this on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />He was on level 30 something.<br /><br />The new update wouldnt let us log in and when I updated it deleted EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Very upset 6 year old
B005MLP8E0|5.0|It's a great theoretical commentary on the over indulgent super rich!<br />I just had to watch it after a vacation to Hearst Castle in California.<br />It's a must see movie!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this is the best app out there that allows you to take care of your own horses! I love it!!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|F the people who use real currency I'm in for doing this game legit use coinz u get good items and it may take more time to get thing done but for me it meanz mo fun
B000FBJAOG|5.0|At first I thought this was a joke by no... it is pretty reasonable for zombies people storm etc. Protection  but mostly zombie
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|I love love love Hobbs writing.  She is my new favorite authors.  Unfortunately I am reading the trilogies from newest to oldest. But it doesn't seem to matter.  Her originality and creativity draw you in to characters you will remember forever.  More entertaining than in Rowling. I wish they would make movies. A great read for any age.
B007XHWROK|5.0|Justin Bieber is one of my favorite artists, and this CD contains a few of my favorites of his. Loved the mini poster included too!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game. While some puzzles are easier than others, they are all solvable. Its a great game to have on hand while waiting in line.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|I glad this came out on kindle fire. You can choose from the original zombies,the foot ball zombie team or World War ll zombies. It is getting harder now to beat my score of 3,021meters because the zombies are closer together and are harder to get past. I recommend this game to people of any age and I'm thirteen
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My tears fall done my face as I read the end........ it's so sad!!!!!!!!! Loved this book!!!!!!!!! Can't wait to read the next one!!!!!!!!
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|handy to have access to on my Kindle...however since I don't do much writing on my Kindle I don't use it often.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I am truly smiling this game. It give u a little more exciting fun to this game. It's like candy you can not stop with one bite.
B004KKX814|4.0|This bey is an awesome one but it did disappoint me a little. I thought since it had rubber on it, it would spin steal but it didn't. Other than that, it is really cool. I love how it goes from HOLE FLAT to SHARP. I give it ****
B005HSG3VK|5.0|ALmost 2 years now have had this and it has held up exceptionally well and the deep pink color has held wonderfully and I keep Kindle in my purse and this cover has worked great to protect it.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I really like this... It helps with my business.. I use it almost everyday to capture looks that I can't get with just my camera..
B0054XOMX4|5.0|This bey is AWSOME! It can spin for more than 7 mins and has a very neat design on its fusion wheel and energy ring. It beat all my beys. If you like stamina types then this bey is made for you. I give it *****
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This did the job that it was suppose to do...but it didn't solve the problem with my Kindle and they replaced it.
B004KKX80A|4.0|This bey is very very cool and has a lot of attack power but the F:D bottom sometimes does not work. You need to have a lot of power for it to work. Anyway I love how it has 4 modes. I give it *****
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app to use to calculate my gas mileage and I use it regularly!! Good price too...free
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This documentary is more in depth and informative than other Dylan docs, but be forewarned it ends at the motorcycle crash.  So you miss some of the best albums of his career like Blood On The Tracks and his erstwhile Christian conversion.  I'd suggest books like Behind The Shades by Howard Sounes for that.  All in all, No Direction Home is wonderfully informative and a lot of fun to watch LOUD.
B005544TRQ|5.0|A very arrogant lawyer and very clever assistant. It can be funny as well. Every episode is entertaining. Love it.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I really enjoyed this application - if i werent on surgical leave, probably too much. I realize that they make extra money by selling spells and such that make the game easier, but i like the challenge of doing the level without at least once. And all that was fine until I got to level 12. At that point, the final level of bubbles are literally invisible above the top of the screen and since the screen doesn't scroll, winning the level is basically luck. If they either change the rules or get the screen to scroll, I'd give it 4 stars - the special power-ups are a little over-priced.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|the app works but is slow. it will do a decent job for the price. i would buy it again.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I got this application after the recommendation from Amazon and I'm glad I did. I recently had surgery and although my pain management is usually pretty good it wasn't good enough to cover bone pain. The program has been helping.<br />The sounds are customizable well beyond other relaxation programs I've tried and most of the musical options don't seem to get repetitive like many others. You can put together as many sounds as you like - some only allow 1 or 2. The only things I wish I could improve would be that the volume control is not very sensitive on some sounds.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun. I love temple run and minions so putting them together is epic. can't wait until I get some costumes because honestly who doesn't like dressing up minions.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|This movie might be alright for older children because the giants are pretty ugly and scarey.  For adults, this is not one of the best movies we have seen recently.
B009G78EE2|4.0|Not what I am used to listening to in hip hop but I found this album to be refreshing and thought provoking. Rap music does not always have to be grimey, street, hood and so on.  Macklemore uses his ability to tell stories and be thought provoking which is becoming a lost art in the genre. 4 stars for doing it well.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This was a very good movie and I highly recommend it to anyone.  Jamie Foxx is especially good, and it has a nice surprise ending.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|Title says it all, Yeezy has done it again.  This album took me a while to get into, but once I did I recognized exactly what it was, progression.  He takes you back to his first album and delivers you songs that could be found on each of his subsequent albums.  There is something for everyone on Yeezus.  Nevermind his personality, who he dates or impregnates the man knows how to make music and that is what I pay him for.
B003XU3MWM|5.0|Good movie, lots of action.  Good story line and acting.  I Will watch it again some time.  Not for children.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I loved this game. It opened the first time and when I tried to open it from the carousel, it shuts down! UPDATE IMMEDIATELY!!
B0053R1T1O|5.0|I love old musical and this one is right up there with the best.  Loved the songs, and the pagentry.
0525478817|5.0|When I picked up this book I was thinking that this might be okay. I read it in less than 24 hours ( I'm a slow reader, forgive me.) and was taken aback by it. I was amazed by the detail and how much it resembled some teenagers. The book was filled with philosophical, funny, sassy, cry-worthy quotes that would leave my with a pen and paper writing them down and saving them. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, even if you do not like Fiction books or any type of book like this. Now I know what you're thinking, \\"This is a book about cancer, I'm going to be depressed if I read it.\\" Well hey, guess what? You'll be crying by the end, but you will also laugh along the way. Within the first 5 pages I was already smirking. This was a very good read, I would read it again, which I never do with books. This book changed the way I thought about people with cancer, and made me realize that not all people want to be treated like the most important ever. As I said before. Well worth the money. Well? What are you waiting for? Scroll up and buy it!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|My 2 week old game stopped working because it was &quot;too old and needs an update&quot; and I can't find the button to push to update in the link they sent me too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Liked all 3 in the series. Fifty Shades of Grey was a great read and so is this book. A must read.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Please publish the next book ASAP.  I cannot wait to see what happens with Dany.  And I hope Tyrion survives. One of my favorites!
B00846REIS|3.0|It was okay. The book reminded of of the Fifty Shades of Grey series. I probably won't read the next one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very cute and addicting. extras are rather expensive. minions are adorable. makes me want to be as despicable as I can be!
B001BKTEZA|4.0|I was in my sixties when I read Grapes of Wrath. I always wondered what all the hypo was about. Now I know. It was decent. I didn't like the ending.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|If your looking for a great card game get this great graphics and it isnt hard to learn lt. Truly an all aged card game
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was great. Sensualism was the topic of the books. Well written. Everyone should read it! A great read.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|It is an okay game so far; I really like how everything moves. However, when you place an enclosure paths form around it that you can't move. The paths block anything that isn't an enclosure from being placed in what should be available spaces.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read. Keeps you in suspense through out the whole time. Ends with a twist I never suspected. A must read
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|if people say that this game is bad don't listen! its awesome and if it freezes just reboot ur kindle!it'll work cause I did the same thing and I got to play this game for 4days !!!!don't listen to dem haters cause they're Lyin!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Started reading while on vacation. Book was in hotel room. I wasn't done at vacations end. When I got home I downloaded Child44 to my I Pad. Very interesting read
B00AVFO41K|4.0|I don't get the negative comments.  Yes, this is a challenging game.  Yes, the developer could add music and yes, he could add  &quot;Very Easy&quot; level to help folks figure out the game.  That said, its fun.  Its a challenge for all the reasons that so many gave it poor ratings.  This is not a game you win or lose, its a game you play.  It is a time sink, it is a little addictive, and it is exciting when your strategy works out the way you had hoped.<br /><br />The key to the game isn't random placement.  There are special balls that can really help.  The arrows can clear multiple rows and columns in a single play.  The trick is to place them properly and hope that you get the right random drops to allow you to execute your plans.  It takes a couple of games to get the gist but after 3 games I had eeked out a 2400 pt game..  granted, that was playing easy.. Normal will probably kick my tail.<br /><br />This is not a &quot;no win situation&quot; because its not about winning.  To stay with the Star Trek theme, Kirk might try to reprogram it, Spock would try to master it and appreciate the enjoyment of the challenge.<br /><br />I agree, a simple tutorial would be nice and might actually reduce the negative reviews.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a fun, intelligent, albeit frustrating little game that will get me through  few boring conference calls at work.  It needs a tutorial or documentation to explain basic play and strategy.  In my opinion, the game is worth money, just be patient.  It will come to you.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very interesting. I've always heard Steve jobs was a different kind of cookie but this book reveals just how different he was. I have always been in love with him. He was different but he was also wonderful. Great read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a GREAT game! I want more!!! It makes you hunt, get frustrated, have success, and leaves you wanting WAY more than 10 levels!!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i love this game but i think they need a new shark plz hav,, another shark.<br />it will be awsome
B00CP2Z5TC|3.0|Diane Young, Step, and Ya Hey are good, but others are not as catchy. Yet, they are not that bad either;especially the guitar sound was favorable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am a huge clue fan and this game is super addictive. Perfect with the amount of difficulty.  You really have to use your brain to figure out all clues.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is a lot of fun but still needs work. it keeps closing when starting up. but other than that when i can play its a really good game and fun. And good for all ages
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|first word I looked up was not in the dictionary, however, it was in my home version. Not too good.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I found the second season incredibly compelling, interesting, and exciting, even more so than the first. I can hardly wait for the third season!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Save the forest and all the birds and other animals. Of course there are bad guys to fight and a village to build with special fields to produce and facilities to store seeds and nectar. It's an addictive game, I'm usually on several times a day. And that works well with the way the game is designed.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game offers players a chance to try their hand at creating their own Jurassic Park, with some help from familiar characters, as well as some novel ones, too. Money can be a hassle at certain points in the game, but you can earn it back pretty easily. You get to develop your park by researching dinosaurs and placing shops and attractions. Plus, you can try and prevent Dion escapes in the Code Red mini game. You can even build in an Underwater and a Glacier part of the park. Overall, you have to get this game. After all, it is free!
B00AVFO41K|4.0|I downloaded this game as the FAotD in spite of the bad reviews and I'm glad I did.  The game is hard, but it's addictive.  The game needs instructions, no doubt about it, and it needs a bit of polish, that's true too, but what surprised me are the whiners complaining that it's too hard and that they think it's no fun.  Well, that's just sour grapes to me.  I've played the game for about an hour and reached a high score of 1,145 on \\"Normal\\" (which was several times my first game's score).  Now, the score block has 6 places so maybe that's still not that high a score, but I had fun.  Is it frustrating, yes.  Is it hard, yes.  Is that a good thing, Yes!<br /><br />So, here are my suggestions for the developer:<br />1) When you match more than 5 in a row or in more than one direction there could be more bells and whistles (not to mention extra points) to commemorate doing something cool.<br />2) Allow changing the background.<br />3) Allow disabling the sound.<br />4) Add basic instructions or a tutorial<br />5) Allow points to build based on setting up combination plays (and play a congratulations sound)<br />6) The Rate Me goes to the wrong app in Amazon<br />7) Don't give in too much to the weenies and make it too easy.<br /><br />For the record I don't care about comparing my score to the rest of the world.<br /><br />I had one instance where it just refused to let me move a piece that was in the open.<br />I had one instance where the app went away during game play (possibly force close, possibly a simple exit).<br /><br />So, not a 5-star game, but it has the potential to be once it has been polished.  I was tempted to give it 5 stars just to counter the bad reviews, but that's not my style.
B0081BU42O|5.0|Iain continues to astound with the latest ion the Culture saga. It expands the frontiers of his science fantasy in a way that makes the future believable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|For anyone who loves period pieces, this is a great early 20th century series. The only compliant I have is that if you leave Amazon Prime video, when you come back, you don't know which episode you should watch next. On Netflix, they bookmark it for you.
B004WKOCP8|2.0|Incubus has been my favorite band since I bought Make Yourself on a whim at my local record shop way back in middle school.  Since then I've seen the band evolve with each album and try something new and creative.  That ended with If Not Now When?  Incubus took absolutely zero risks with this album and instead made an album that didn't take much effort and was sure to be bought by their eager fanbase (look at the sales of this album and Monuments and Melodies, the fans were hungry for more!).  Most of the songs on this album are drawn out, slow and boring.  I actually deleted \\"Friends and Lovers\\" from my Amazon Cloud drive because it's so terrible.  \\"Company of Wolves\\" is actually an excellent song and earned the album an extra star from me, this sounds like a great ending song for a thriller movie or video game.  The rest of the album however sounds like the band lost their \\"alpha male\\" instincts and instead the only rocker on the album \\"Adolescents\\" sounds like a Nickelback b side.<br /><br />I hope the band takes a good hard look in the mirror and only releases another album if they really have their hearts in it, vs releasing a snoozer to appease the fans.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I love The Wizard of Oz and I have read all the books and watched all the movies. Yes, there are lots of books by L. Frank Baum. And while this is a pretty sincere attempt to pay homage to the original movie and borrow from the books, it seems too predictable. The performances of the witches are powerful and pretty great. James Franco, as Oz, has to work his way into the role as does Oz as the savior of Oz.<br /><br />The movie is heavy with cgi which is great because the world of Oz is brought to life, but it's also sad because the original movie didn't rely so heavily on special effects. And the familiar Disney sidekick is used throughout the movie which can get annoying since it's a tried and true method to introduce comic relief for the company's movies as well as allow the main character to voice his/her thoughts. Here the sidekick is actually more interesting than Oz at times although he isn't as annoying or cloying like Jar Jar Binks.<br /><br />The movie is a nice intro to a series of movies on the world of Oz and the various fantastical creatures there, but is that the intent here? My hope is that they continue to pay homage to not only the original movie, but also to the series of books. Wouldn't it be nice to meet more of the creatures of Oz beyond the China girl?
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Thought it would be better. The storyline seemed o have gotten compromised along the way like most Hollywood movies do.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|I love Hitchcock and Jimmy Stewart. But even if I didn't, it would be easy to love this movie. The premise still works and hits home with many of us in this YouTube, everyone's-got-a-camera era-- we love to watch other people. It's in the watching that Stewart's character sees something that maybe he shouldn't have and therein lies the suspense. This is one of those movies that you can watch again and again. Stewart is watching the ultimate reality show, right in his own backyard. Yes, this is an older movie and Hitchcock is probably better known to the younger viewers for Psycho and The Birds, but this is such a great, timeless masterpiece that is relevant today that I hope new generations watch this and appreciate it. It's a gem.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over and keep noticing things I missed before. This is a favorite of my family's.
0486266885|5.0|It all worked out and it was fast and easy just the way they said it would be!!!!! I would buy from them again!
B009CF7GRY|5.0|When I heard that Footloose was being made, I was angry. You never want to mess up a classic. However, I saw this in theaters and was pleasantly surprised. I actually liked it as much as the original. I'm not one to re-watch movies, but this one, I didn't mind at all.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Good acting, very good make up but the story line was hard to follow.  Having the movie on Blu-ray helped because you could go back and review scenes.
B00275EHJG|5.0|My mom erased ToyStory 3 from her DVR and was in a panic because my nephew will be at her house next week. I knew we could get it quickly through Amazon. This is NECESSARY to have when my nephew is around. But we all love it; not just him.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Big on gunfire (although no one had good aim), small on plot line and dialogue.  It falls in the middle of the Die Hard pack.
0062024329|5.0|if you read the original novel, you may appreciate the illustrations highly. I recommend for most graphic novel readers this book.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|Graphics were decent but the story line was slow to develop and weak. Too much time wasted getting to the point.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|The cover states &#34;One of the best anime movies&#34; I highly disagree, however it is great to watch either way.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|Everything is stated so clearly and simply. When applied life changes for the better. Highly recommended. This should be required reading in grade school. If it was the world would be totally different.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|don't buy it it doesn't turn on or it turns on then makes u wait for yen minutes and shuts off DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!
B002RI9UBS|3.0|The book started really well, but just became silly and totally unbelievable toward the end. Rather than convincing the reader of the existence of god, a claim made at the start of the story, it merely confirmed the delusional mentality of those obsessed by a particular belief.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Well like the title says it was good till it froze but now it wont open. I had played for a whole day then it froze and had to shut off my kf to get out and now it wont open. I was about to put a five star rating on it till this happened. It's a shame to because I was looking forward to competing with friends
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a really interesting mystery with an interesting plot.  It is a good read and has interesting characters.  A story with twists and turns that aren't obvious.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Everyone should see this movie at least once.  It's that simple.<br />The character and plot resolution is of the highest standard in literature / story-telling.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I got this for my mom because she loves to play card games all the time. And because we can not always play like we use to  she can play on the kindle
B00CWY76CC|4.0|At least I can get out of these rooms.  Fun but not too difficult. I find it very relaxing.  I enjoy the background music..
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game was really cute, and my kids loved it, but it only worked once and wouldn't open again. I uninstalled and installed again and it still doesn't work. Don't waste your money!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This was the first Kemco/Kotobuki RPG I played, and it's a solid game. I favored the old &quot;invisible&quot; fight generator as opposed to seeing the enemies, but the rest of the game was excellent.  Great characters. and level grinding. Lots of extra dungeons to explore. Awesome break skills too. Get this game if you enjoy good RPGs.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife started watching first. I was not interested. Now I am hooked on it. Betcha can't watch just 1
B006FE83UE|5.0|Great movie; old but after reading the books my students really liked putting a face on the characters  Boo Radley was a hero in my classroom ;)
0307949508|4.0|My wife found the trilogy fascinating, at the suggestion of one of our sons.. I haven't had chance to read it yet but it sounds good..
B003VANOFY|1.0|Pros:<br />Price<br />Comfort<br />Incredible noise cancellation<br /><br />Cons:<br />Interference noises<br />Dropping wireless connection<br />Logitech Gaming Software has compatibility issues with some computers.<br /><br />The headset drops its connection constantly. (sometimes every 30 seconds, at most 2-3 times an hour.)<br />There are several pages on forums asking Logitech for support. They just blame anything but their headset, then ignore once troubleshooting leads to their it being the headset. Product would be 5/5 if it didn't have this issue. Logitech support is now worthless, used to be amazing. Would avoid buying for sure.
B001R1PZ9M|5.0|these turtle movies where awesome as a kid..and now my kids love it and watch it almost every day lol
0307236722|4.0|easy to follow recipes...have made a few...all taste good! like the basics detailed in the early chapters. Nice illustrations as well
B0064X7FVE|1.0|DO NOT like the new version at all. Not user friendly. Why change a good thing? Deleted it!!!! Change it back!
B000094HLA|5.0|I whole-heartedly recommend this recording to anyone who isn't so bogged down by early music dogma that they are unable to appreciate Schiff's nuance and musicality. The performance captured on this disc is live and in concert, so it isn't perfect, but that hardly matters because it only makes the experience of listening to it that much more real, more authentic (as opposed to some phony studio album with obvious splices and other fancy editing). At this point in my own musical career I am far more interested in hearing music that is engaging and personal, as opposed to that which is &#34;perfect&#34; or &#34;historically informed,&#34; but also cold and sterile.<br /><br />I also own Schiff's 1982 recording for Decca and love to compare the two in terms of tempos, articulations, dynamics, etc. There are differences, though I'm not sure which I prefer, which probably means that they both bring out unique aspects of the music and are worth spending time with.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Good enough for what I need it for and it looks just like it on my computer.<br />Thank you so much
B008M721MS|1.0|Have used this app before with limited success on an Android phone. Got it again pre-installed on my Kindle but due to usage issues I don't go on often enough to remember my password. I attempted creating a new account as it would not send a &quot;forgot password&quot; email and the app refused to cooperate. No matter what or how many characters I used for a password it insisted it was always too short, it managed to change my user name to something completely off the wall (which was not a result of any text autocorrect), and sadly, was just an overall useless app at a moment when it was a personally important  to have. I will be researching other video chat/text apps that I'm certain will be less headache to use.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Please I am waiting on the next one so desperately. I love your writing and I love these books so very much.<br /><br />Looking and waiting very patiently..<br /><br />Great Novels.....I can finish one in a day.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Tracy Lee Munoz
B004GYY714|3.0|I have had this app less than three days, and thus have not had sufficient time to fully evaluate it to my complete satisfaction. Yet here we are, here I am, with a request from Amazon to rate this product. First...IT WORKS! But why shouldn't it? One assumes that these free apps have been tested before they are released. The sound quality is quite good, but that's more a function of the phone than the app itself. And so there we are. Perhaps, in six months or so, when I've used this app for a while, I may reevaluate it and update this review. And I may not. In my opinion Amazon needs to reevaluate its product review policies to allow users more time before they request and expect a review.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I work in the electronic industry and thoroughly enjoyed reading this short work. I hope that others will take the time to read this book, put down their favorite electronic time wasting device and look for their creative side to come roaring forth with the next great invention. I would like to thank the writer for this book and the inspiration that I hope to carry on with from it.
0061950726|4.0|Are you hearing an echo? This is a fine and interesting book. Christina Baker Kline has created a powerful portrait of personal resilience while pulling back the curtains on one of the sorrier chapters of American child-rearing. How East Coast immigrant orphans were often turned into unschooled, abused indentured servants is unforgivable.<br /><br />I appreciate how the author intertwined two stories, that of a Depression-era Irish orphan from age seven until early adulthood as well as a contemporary teenager in foster care, an uneven system not so different from the orphan train experience. The author tells the orphan's story in the first-person and the foster kid's tale in third-person. Because of this choice, the orphan's story is told in a more immediate fashion, and my guess is that most readers will care more about her tale than that of Molly, the foster child....and in all fairness, it's simply more fascinating to read about yesteryear than now. The book's ending is also rushed, as many endings tend to be. But don't let these observations deter you. Read this book, and share it with girls you know aged ten and older. They will enjoy ORPHAN TRAIN as much as adults will.
B00BG5CXGM|3.0|It looks great and maintains a slim profile for the phone. But there is not much drop protection, no covers for the  headphone or lightning jacks, and didn't come with a screen protector.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|this was an amazing movie. it left you biting your nails and covering your eyes while peeking through your fingers. great movie to watch on a date night. nudge nudge wink wink.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|A great read, very suspenseful and well written. I couldn't put it down. A very thought provoking story, I would highly recomend this book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the character development for this show.  The season's momentum kept gaining speed as every episode passed and the finale was amazing!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely love the books. The first time I read them, I wasn't able to put them down. I read one book a week. They are still a great read the second time around. The only complaint I have is the ending. I think I wanted more than I got for the ending.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|This story was better than ever.  So much good stuff about Australia and the people.  Poor Harry.  He is definitely flawed and needs major help.  With his job it is no wonder he drinks.
B002AOWXQ8|4.0|Very unique band with very distinct styling. I think I like the music a lot, but it definitely take some getting use to the different song styling.
1609611543|5.0|Excellent and extremely informative information.  Everyone should read this book. It just goes to show greed trumps our health.<br /> READ READ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0015KO52S|5.0|I love White's vision with him music. So many 'flavors' and styles wrapped into one package. Great little rock album. Perfect summertime music!
B000MZHW40|5.0|I have seen this movie several times.  Well done. I purchased it for my son as a gift. He thinks it excellent.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Laid back, easy going, just great tracks to jam out to. Just good tunes that are easy on the ears.
B00AA8Q0FQ|4.0|I liked the fact that two features in one disk were available. My nieces were pleased with their gift and cool factor went up a couple of notches.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|First few books were very slow in developing, but book 4-5 were very good. Good plot and very gripping. Read it
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This story is heartwarming.  It teaches empathy, as well as lessons in genetic diseases.<br />Great lessons in bullying and communication.<br />Some pages were so funny, I laughed out loud and had to read it to my husband or friend; others were so sad I cried.<br /><br />Great book!  So glad our school system middle schoolers have to read it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Just a fun story with a nice message about paying it forward and being true to yourself and your family. It also has a spiritual message for anyone, religious or not.
B00338QENI|2.0|I found this book somewhat interesting but found it dragged on about the same thing. Probably could have written it in half the pages. I finally gave up on it and was unable to finish it
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Family values, class hierarchy, good luck and bad woven in a world unknown to most Americans.  Maybe not so different yet still mysterious.  I felt a connection to the characters even though they were from a different world and a different time.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|Best Blu ray with Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis. Super story and amazing special effects. Highly recommend this film in Blu Ray.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I don't get very far before I run out of bubbles and I can't seem to score any points-what am I doing wrong? But it's fun.
B00B78AIV0|5.0|I tried a sample through Amazon as it was going to be next in a book club I am part of... and I just had to have it!! Got a kindle so I could have it in 60 seconds and wished i did not have to work to be able to read it all right away!!<br />She is a wonderful writer, making us believe it is truly written by a fifteen year old; feel the oppression of that father versus the freedom they later discover and we as readers go through the process with them... suffering, breathing, feeling the lack of air, the strength of the silence and then the break away that is going on in the country as well. Like the narrator, not judging just living what is until we find how hard things really hard and that things can be different. Can´t wait to get more of her books!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like it, have it for my I touch and bigger is better.  The only problem is I own the version for my I touch with no ads and now I have ads.
B0011WMHRK|4.0|I were to compair this music to anything else, I might say in some ways WHITE LIGHT era VELVET UNDERGROUND, but with much more musicality, and a broader pallette of sound colors, melodic lines from around the world, and the formal connections with Stockhausen, as opposed to the Velvet Underground's formal connections with the FLUXUS movement, and LaMonte Young.
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|Though the story meandered a bit, and introduced characters who seemed to have very little to do with advancing the plot, it was a touching and heart warming story of the ties that bind a family over the years and distance.
B001MTENOC|5.0|No matter what religion you follow, the info in this book can be life affirming.  This book is not about dogma, but about life and it's continuance into immortality.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a well written character novel. I just keep thinking about the characters and can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I am a Showtime subscriber, but my parents are not and my Dad has become a fan of the series.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My kids love this movie and when they watch it, my husband and I get stuck watching it too. Its enjoyable for the whole family.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|The first 10 min of the movie is somewhat interesting but it severely goes downhill from there. Ben Affleck's acting is very wooden, never showing any emotion to the character he is playing, and never changes throughout the whole movie. I'll never buy another movie with Affleck's name anywhere on it. Just a terrible actor and director. I wish I could return my Instant Video purchase of it as I'll never watch it again.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Want an album that makes you feel good and tap your feet, well here it is.<br />This is one of the most original bands I have heard in a good while.<br />A touch of rock blended with drums, a bit of the soul of a marching band, and great vocals.<br />Happy Happy Music, so upbeat that it should be used for helping with depression.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Given that slavery was truly an abomination in the early history of our nation, I found this movie to be highly irresponsible and inflammatory, and thus, offensive.  Great strides had been made (post WWII and pre-2008) to rectify this horrible injustice.  After the 2008 political climate, our country has once again become divided almost as much as it ever was.  What was the purpose of this film?  To make money?  A statement?  Where in  Mississippi would a black man, even one who was free, be invited to dine with white slave owners in the 1850's?  So the purpose was not one of historical accuracy.  Aside from the blood and guts that so many people have come to see as \\"entertaining,\\" there are few redeeming qualities to be found here. It can only add fuel to a fire that desperately needs to be squelched, not re-ignited. I'm sorry I spent money on this garbage.  I personally want something that adds to a solution instead of something that is part of a problem.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|In a way it should get another star but , oh well. At least it's not about zombies or super heroes with psychologic issues. I'll take the beer and pipe tobbaco.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved book one, quick read and left me wanting more so immediately ordered this book and Book 3...Please use the right characters for the movie!
1451662432|5.0|This guy could fall into a bucket of sauer-kraut and come out smalling like beer and a good cegar. He's my hero.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was very entertaining, there were cliff hangers and the make up scenes are to die for..will make a good movie with the right characters
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Although I think the storyline diverges a bit too often, particularly with the Greek characters and the adult versions of the cousins who live across the street from Nabi, I loved every word of this book.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This app has the fatal flaw of so many digital clocks, it cannot be dimmed sufficiently to prevent it from interfering with a light sleeper. Too bad because otherwise it is great.
0399534601|4.0|The whole thing is one fantastic idea after another! It's highly required for anyone who wants to boost his/her creativity without investing lots of time and money to develop an artistic skill
B00005JLIU|5.0|Although the topic of this movie is terrible, the story is fun.  Our local high school put on a great performance of this.  I bought this dvd for our local library in appreciation of everyone's hard work on their performance.
B00DIFARQ6|1.0|free version had 2 missions, lasted a whole 5 minutes. It took longer to download using the stupid amazon app than it did to play it
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This app looks like a fun subway surfers but ive read other reviews and my friend and family agree that this app shuts itself down, and will not work on Kindle Fire. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The wife and I have been glued to to TV screen watching how Alicia's life unfolds. Great actors, great story, solid show !
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I wish this game was available on the kindle fire HD.The game is definitely good for hand and eye coordination. And my daughter enjoys it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|the acting and dialogue are fantastic, very entertaining show.  the setting and historical references add to the show greatly.<br />love it.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|My husband found this app for my Kindle so I could print.  The first time I tried to use it I couldn't get it to work.  I tried several time it type the website I wanted to print from it would continuously say, &#34;HP ePrint has stopped.&#34;  When I went to print something else the next day it worked fine.  I don't plan to print from my Kindle a lot.  I just want to have that option.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Well staged and acted.  Emotional punch in most scenes that occasionally moved me to tears.  General Lee was well played by Sheen, and Jeff Daniels' interpretation of General Chamberlain is simply awesome especially his handling of the Maine deserters; possibly Daniels best movie role ever, IMHO.  I also enjoyed Sam Elliot's work playing Colonel John Buford . . . 'We got the high ground!'  The Civil War re-enactors in this film scored highly for the parts they played . . . though having few spoken lines, the field maneuvers, cavalry riding, cannon firing, and a moving scene where the Confederates cheer General Lee all played well to the overall realism of the movie.  Last, this is a war movie though violent at times that with the exception of the field hospital scenes is reasonably free of objectionable blood and gore.  An important piece of Civil War history very well told.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was fun and challenging at parts without being annoyingly hard. If you get stuck you can search YouTube for instructions.
B00AVFO41K|3.0|If you are someone that prefers seeing game progression through level advancement or being given fancy high 5's from the game for beating a level, then this game is not for you.  This game is for those that can plan ahead, and think things out.  There are no level resets.  You continue your game for as long as you can from the difficulty you select (easy, normal or hard).  Essentially this game will feed your intellectual side for logic solving, not your need to be praised for finishing a level or a game.  This game is challenging, a nice change in comparison to most game apps.<br /><br />This game is designed to be unbeatable.  The point is not to beat the game for you cannot.  The goal, is to last as long as you can by clearing out rows of colors through careful planning and a little luck.  If you cannot figure out how to play this game in the first few minutes, then in all likelihood, this game is not for you.  Having in game instructions would not have made this game any more enjoyable for those that rated this game only one star.  If you are color-blind this game is not for you.  You ability to play this game will exercise on your ability to discern colors, not shapes.<br /><br />Although I found a couple of times the game would not move a piece when it clearly was allowed to another square but in a subsequent turn it permitted the move when the path of the piece was not changed.  I found this mildly frustrating since this game is affected greatly by one bad move or a missed opportunity.  I mention this because I found this one flaw noteworthy since it ended my game much sooner than it should have by not allowing me to make a permissible movement.  For this reason I withhold a star.<br /><br />Yes, even I enjoy a little advancement in a game and sense of accomplishment.  The scoring is little slow considering how many digits are available in the scoreboard.  Perhaps removing unnecessary zeros might not have made me feel pathetic by scoring me 001350, rather than scoring me 1,350.  It made me feel anything less than 100,000 is sub-par.  So yes, not only does this game not fluff you up with warm and fuzzies, but it will yank you down in the end when you notice how little you scored compared to how high the game can count.  For this reason, I withhold another star.<br /><br />This game shows a lot of promise.  Maybe they could implement a leveling system instead of just having the free play mode (if you've ever played diner rush or games like that you understand that free play just goes and goes and goes, until you fail.

So yes, not only does this game not fluff you up with warm and fuzzies, but it will yank you down in the end when you notice how little you scored compared to how high the game can count.  For this reason, I withhold another star.<br /><br />This game shows a lot of promise.  Maybe they could implement a leveling system instead of just having the free play mode (if you've ever played diner rush or games like that you understand that free play just goes and goes and goes, until you fail.

B00AO686MY|5.0|This is a classic film, and seeing it now on blu-ray has been fantastic.  The DVD disc is a bonus.  And lots of fun special features!!  And all for ~$15, you really can't beat that deal.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. It gives me all the information I need. It is especially great for traveling. Helps me make good wardrobe decisions!
B00797MB0O|4.0|The movie itself wasn't the best, but Charlize was fantastic. She channeled all the craziness of the &#34;successful&#34; people of her generation and it was beautiful.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Have only had the USB cable a short time but so far so good. Not having any problems with it. Good price too! Was delivered within 2 days or ordering which was great.
1423124960|3.0|Purchased this book for my 3 year old daughter because she recently became fascinated with all things Disney Princesses and because I was looking for a book that contained several short stories to read at bed time.  This book delivers in that aspect…the stories are the perfect length and not too time consuming to read.  However, the stories themselves are dull and don’t seem to capture my daughter’s interest/attention.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Definitely recommend for upper elem. grades and up. Interesting story, mostly likeable  characters. And dragons! Must read books in order.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Funny as Tina Fey can get.  I liked it better than Ellen DeGeneres' book.  I laughed out loud over and over.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the best thing sins the computer. I love this game so much I have it on my computer and X box 360.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Undamaged, brand new no problems at all. At this price it's more than worth it! I got it within 7 days and I am still buying from here.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|It just doesn't get any better than Home, but Gone Gone Gone is close. Can't wait to hear what's next.<br />Rock on Phillip
B006C5FWH8|5.0|This a great old school style turned based rpg. Countless options, ok well I'm sure someone has counted them but you get the point. Good stuff this one.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this series. It is a new twist on the characters. I like the quirky Holmes character and the rational down to earth Watson.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|Nice watch! Its a big face watch but pretty! Is not heavy! You can feel the quality, it got a lot details! Its a any occasions watch! Good purshase love it :)
1490313370|5.0|James Altucher spells it out, with unabashed candor - CHOOSE YOURSELF isn't a book about putting yourself above everything else - it's about taking care of yourself because there is no one else left to do that FOR you.  If you're going to be of help to others, you need to see to your own needs first, and that is where Altucher starts, and finishes up.<br /><br />If you're wondering how to reset your own compass to navigate the now-seemingly-hostile waters of making a living and doing well at it, in a world that seems bent on 'phasing out' the everyday worker, this is your guide for doing so.  This is about taking the wheel of your own destiny and a very savvy take on just how to make that work.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this the best game on the kindle. the new update is awesome. it gives you smooth lighting which looks cool. it's a great game. you can build almost anything. in the game it feels great to find awesome things. the only down in the game is that Redstone doesn't work when you mine it, you get nothing from it. can't wait until that is fixed.
B00AQNOCZ0|4.0|There are two discs per case, so it isn't one individual title and cover per case. But, it's a great deal to own the complete set.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!!! IT'S MORE FUN THAN THAT OLD SUBWAY SURFERS GAME OR ANY OF THE TEMPLE RUN GAMES !!!!!!!!!AND IT'S SOOOOOOO CUTE!!!!!!
B00AVFO41K|1.0|Some aps are easy to figure out or at least give a basic instruction.  This one is not like that at all. No instructions...no idea....no try outs.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|A lot different than the gory zombie movies out there.  Actually brings out some emotion from you instead of repetition of the smash, shoot usually in these movies.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good challenging game for the not so brainy!  I LIKE IT<br />REcommend for anyone who likes to just play for the sake of playing.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Love the TV show, needed more for the off season. This is s treat.  Great line work, too.  More to see than I expected.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This film was fun from the first moment.  Lots of action and the special effects were excellent.  Sad we have to wait so long for the next movie.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|The perfect book for the beach or to just get away from it all. Samantha is a fun character, and love the English countryside setting.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Once you figure the interface out, the program is fantastic.  It is a real life saver for helping to explain how to work with fractions with my sons.  Highly recommend this application.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I loved the way the author describes feelings and locations.it makes you feel like you are there<br /> E experiencing the story yourself.
B00881PTRC|2.0|Good concept, too many issues with program hanging and have to force stop it.  Used on a Samsung Galaxy Note 2.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I enjoyed this novel, it's a fast read, and has an interesting twist at the end.  The cold war setting also adds to the interest.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Good movie and I don't recall any bad language used (if so, it was minor).  My kids loved it and are waiting on the next one.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Been using this for a bit over 6 months. Suddenly, just this week, it's partially covered with ads, the hourly forecast seems to be missing, or harder to find, and I'm pretty annoyed. Trying Weatherbug now.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a fun game, an easy way to space out after a long day.  It does shut down a lot which is frustrating but for the most part a great game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is a ripoff of subway suffer but it is a good ripoff. at least it is entertaining. doesn't take long to download either
B0064X7FVE|1.0|WC automatically updated to the latest version. This was a great app until this update. Don't waste your time downloading this app. You will not find it User friendly.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The author succeeds in writing about an interesting and unusual subject written in a sensitive, engaging style. Her characterization was good and the plot was engrossing.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is a great series but it is not finished yet.  I would wait until more of the books are out because you're not going to want to stop when it ends.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Nikon's wireless infrared remote is great, I use it a lot ... so why would anyone want this one too?  Well, if you are behind the camera shooting hands-off you don't have to worry about where you hold the device (newer cameras have a second infrared sensor on the back of the camera, but a wired remote still gives you more freedom when you are hiding from birds or other wildlife and want to keep movement to a minimum).  Also, this remote supports a half-press (which the wireless does not) so you can use it to focus.  Finally, it has a lock, so it works for time exposures.  Also, if you have a D7100, there is a menu item you can select that will allow this remote to function as a record on-off button for video,  which means that you can velcro the thing to the arm of your fluid head so that it sits right under your thumb... it's a great convenience not to have to reach for that record button on the body to start and stop every shot.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love that Amazon offers Downton  Abbey  for a nominal fee. Thank you from those of us who must pay.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|The spin most get in school, or this one, may both be wrong. But, I'm so glad I got this side of the story, written in an engaging, captivating style that made history come alive. Cynics of &#34;left-wing&#34; spin need to be warned that, like the television 10 part documentary series, &#34;original&#34; quotes are used to support the author's opinions. The television series has the advantage of confronting the skeptic with actual audio and/or video clips of people being referenced: So, those dismissing any stuff that doesn't support their ideology as being mere propaganda, deserve this response: Don’t let the facts stand in the way of your comfortable reality. Being entitled to an opinion is not the same as having a respected opinion. I instinctively distrust those so insecure in their position they cannot entertain an audience with those who differ.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|So refreshing to have a non-violent game that is fascinating and exciting to experience. A mesmerizing and beautiful metaphor for life!
B002DQFHKM|5.0|This is simply put a fantastic album for the past. Great Songs and Great Artists! Brings back a bygone age of solid rock.
1609611543|4.0|I like the book, it seems a little hard to follow but I think it's good advise.  The book came in good condition and on time.
B0012HF5NC|4.0|I watched it as a teen and my kids are now 7 & 11. They enjoyed the action and the bad puns.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really had a great time with this game on my Kindle.  Enough to keep you thinking without being frustrating.  Can't wait for more rooms!
B0084RSZKI|4.0|This is a very cute movie. Eddy Murphy is funny as well as the rest of the cast. I would recommend it.
0743270754|5.0|The book &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; and the subsequent movie &#34;Lincoln&#34; allowed me to get to know that man much better. Talk about someone who lacked humility! Very good all around.
1878424319|5.0|Buy this book and read it,  definitively instructive and if you apply consistently what is said here it can change your life for better.
B0095P31L6|5.0|This is a great Flick. Fun for the whole family. Almost as good as America Tale. Johnny Dep does a great job with the character Rango.
0987300911|4.0|This book definitely will make you get the score you need with practice for it sure give you excellent elements to achieve it BUT ONLY if you practice practice and practice<br /><br />Loving the writing section
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun fun fun but i dont like to be forced to give a review  so i can go on to the next level
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I enjoyed having all the movies in one package.  I could do a Harry Potter Marathon and watch them in one weekend.  Which I didn't do, am saving them for a long weekend.<br /><br />They shipped quickly and in very good condition.<br /><br />Thanks
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This is by far the best tv show ever!  It has suspense, adventure,comedy...it has it all!  Sam and Dean has such a great comaderie going with each!  This season held me in suspense as they fought the monsters from purgatory!  I can't wait to get Season 8 on dvd!!!!!
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is great.<br /><br />The fact that they took a different approach to music, bringing disco to near mainstream is amazing.<br />I would rank this album right up there with all of their other albums.
B000008L53|4.0|Cat Stevens' last album (as Cat Stevens) was first released in December 1978, a year after he converted to Islam. Cat had seemingly been growing tired of the music business for a while and some of that was beginning to show up in his work. I find this album to be about 50% great and 50% filler. The album starts off strong with Just Another Night and Daytime which do sound \\"Back to Earth\\". Bad Brakes isn't what I would call \\"earthy\\" but it's a great rocker. I know that some people really like Randy but, for me, it's a little too similar to Daytime which I like better. The Artist is a cool instrumental and Last Love Song is a great number. Nascimento and Never are okay but, once again, there's a feel of Cat just using ideas that have been used better elsewhere. The album isn't as bad as some say but it isn't a peak either and the five songs that I like, I REALLY LIKE. I was trying to leave a review for the 2001 cd reissue but it looks like it's available now as a download.
B00BWLKTOS|4.0|This Group is amazing in their skills to play.  The music puts you in a cheerful and peaceful mood.  I am not as crazy about this album as I am the first (choice of songs) but I still enjoy the music.
B0012GMZZ4|5.0|Carlos Santana released Blues for Salvador in October 1987. It's actually one of the better Santana albums from the 1980's despite it mostly being a grab bag of outtakes, demos and the such. The album is surprisingly strong and most of it's a Santana album even though it's listed as a Carlos Santana album. Standout songs include: Bailando/Aquatic Park, Bella, Trane, Mingus, a ripping live Now That You Know and the title track, Blues for Salvador. If you like Santana, there's a good chance that you'll like most of the stuff on here.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome app but when I started playing today it took me out of thee app. I'm disappointed :(. Now I had to delete it and download it again. Still it's a funny app :D. The minions fight for the trophy except for the teensy weensy little minion starts to do something. Once you've past all the obstacles, it's the Vecter Battle u have to beat vecter. I did it once, now I've lost my connection cuz I deleted it. Great app. Have a great day!
B006M4F67A|5.0|This version of mahjong keeps your interest. The only thing that I dislike is when you click on a puzzle the timer starts instead of waiting for your first move.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Love this movie, it never gets old. It's a great family movie that brings back lots of good memories... And now my children watch it too!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love all the team lava story game! I play on my kindle fire and i love it but when i got my iphone i looked up the 'story' games and all of these other games that aren't offered in the Amazon games showed up, and there like so much!! But i don't like playing on my small iphone screen, so i wish that they would offer the other games on Amazon ='(
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|While many happy things happened during the season, I didn't care for the season finale. I also  thought Mr. Barrow's issues should have been handled better. He is conniving and back-stabbing, but they portrayed those who sought justice as hateful.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|its not free if you want to finish the game its five dollars. other than that it was fun toplay
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game.. has become my new addiction. I can play this game for hours and I don't get bored at all.. so far better then candy crush
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I think I am in love with a character in a book!! Christian is my<br />True fantasy man! I  hope there will be more of \\"fifty\\" from James to come.
1623420148|5.0|HOT!!! HYSTERICAL!!! LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY!!  CRINGE WORTHY!!! ROMANTIC!!!  ONE AWW MOMENT AFTER ANOTHER!!<br /><br />Hands down the funniest and fun-est book I've read lately.  A story told completely from the man's POV turned out to be insightful and hysterical!  Who would've thought???<br /><br />I have no idea how Ms. Chase had such insight into a man's mind, but I, for one, could completely believe all of his thought processes throughout the book.<br /><br />It was so great to see the progression of Drew from a Man-whore to becoming a completely whipped, in love, can't live without her, would die for her , settle down with one woman type of man. I laughed out loud at his antics and applauded Kate for her strength, and sense of humor through it all.<br /><br />\\" Women fall in love quicker than men. Easier and more often. But when guys fall? We go down harder.  And when things go bad? When it's not us who ends it?  We don't get to walk away.  We crawl. \\"<br /><br />Drew could be so sweet, and then make you just want to scream at him in a matter of seconds. The over the top gestures were laugh out loud funny and the mistakes he made, only made you love him more.  You just knew deep down, he would do whatever it took to win Kate's trust and heart.<br /><br />Can't wait for more books in this series!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|That was the best game I have ever played!<br />It was so fun everybody has to play it.<br />You really have to think.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|It is a superb court room drama I can't in anyway stop looking at this movie over and over again
B00C9PQ7I8|4.0|I like Mavis Staples. She is just an appealing character, with wit, charm, talent and perseverance. Four stars just because I like this album, but I don't love it as much as the last one. Still, well produced, with intelligent arrangements.
1451648537|4.0|i find the book very good, written well and in terms I understand. it hold my attention. I highly recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a good soap opera with some intriguing characters and a wonderful setting!  For anyone with an interest in history, WWI was portrayed quite well for the short means given.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved it! It was a great book, much better than the movie. Story was awesome and sometimes scary as if it could really happen.
B00280LYHS|5.0|My 9 year old son has loved and devoured every book in this and the Kane Chronicles series.  He is anxiously awaiting House of Hades.  These books not only gave him a love of reading, but also sparked a new interest in ancient history and mythology.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is by far the most fun, addictive, and enjoyable android game I've ever played. Every time I play it when I'm done my wrist hurts from holding my kindle way too long. This is a must have game.
B00B7FXZQS|1.0|What an awful excuse for a film.<br />i put this at the top of my worst movie ever made list.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|This OST is fantastic. The music for Portal 2 is amazing and I love how they fit the music to what actions you are performing to the that you're in. It's a sweet collectible too. The codes inside for Ap-Sap and DOTA 2 make it extra worthwhile. Who doesn't enjoy Wheatley talking while you're sapping a sentry?
0395389496|5.0|Every child should own this book. Heck, every ADULT should own this book. Such a classic story, no matter the season.
0425263924|5.0|The book was fabulous! I was disappointed because I thought this was a trilogy, based on what others had said, but I want more and the book left me wanting more! I cannot wait to see what's next, I just hope the next one comes out soon!
B000002ITW|4.0|I bought the original vinyl in 1971 and with expanded edition, it is cool. the electric side is great. Anytime you get Neil young trying to compete with Stephen still on guitar and vice versa, it's a jam session , to be sure. the music , singing, writing and lyrics are all great. Good politics too, songs for their age , as well as ours today. Find the cost of freedom, we sure are finding that now.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|This is a good show, I never watched it on tv and just found it on my kindle. I need two more words for this review, so there
B00004U5SC|4.0|Good western and well done, considering the time is was made.  Plan to watch it at least one more time.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I loved the second book as much as the first. Didn't disappoint. I'm 35% of the way through book 3 now and will continue through to the end. It's been a very long time since there has been a series with such richness of detail and well paced storytelling with very few sections of the book that I'd want to skip.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I had to re- install it so it would work and then it wouldn't work a few<br />minutes  after and it still won't work
1582701709|4.0|The teen I am mentoring has amazing ambition and drive but lives in a terrible home situation. I bought her this book to give her a way to put the Secret in place in her life, to give her a better view of the world, and to give her a chance to see that the power of affirmations is in her hands.
B007PKDW44|5.0|my mom is actually the one who got me interested in Volbeat, the first song I heard from them was \\"still counting\\" and I still think it is there best song yet. I recommend beyond hell/above heaven to people who are interested in Nirvana, Nickelback, presidents of the U.S.A. etc. the album has a very unique style but its very tasteful. If you enjoy this album I recommend... silver side up and all the right reasons both by Nickelback. If you are enjoying these please follow my instagram here -> -> @hidden_bands <- <-
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I absolutely loved reading this book. I started reading it on my iPad at the beach and couldn't put it down. I have the Kindle version which is excellent because I can read it on my iPad as well as my iPhone with the Kindle app. The two electronic versions keep synced so I don't have to remember where I was in the book on one device versus the other - whichever device I use will sync me to the furthest part of the book that I have read.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|good but not as good as season 1&2, but still looking forward to season 4. The show is just very well done from the writing production to the acting :) Not to many good series are currently on TV, this is one of them:)<br />RF
034553154X|4.0|Full year calendar. Not too bad, has Jan/Fed2014 at the end too. The artwork is pretty unique and I like that it isn't related to the show. Overall I like the calendar.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|it fun but hard and once it froze my kindle I had to delete it then install it again cause it wasn't openingbut really fun
B004EWFV9K|4.0|In “The Troubled Man,” Wallander has a whole new set of problems to worry about. He is preoccupied not only with the crime story around which “The Troubled Man” revolves but also with his diminished prospects and deteriorating state of mind. Mankell pretends that Wallander's career ends right here. On other occasions when famous characters and series are bid adieu, their creators may contrive a cliffhanger, an actual tumble or a moment of passionate and intense surprise. Mankell's character does nothing like that, he lets retire his well-loved characters without suspense. Wallander sounds just fed up and bored.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is really fun. Sometimes you get stuck and there's more than one way to solve most puzzles. I love it.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|As you read you question and go over the clues in your mind and try and predict the outcome.  The questions are:  Is anyone as they seem to be?  As innocent or as guilty?  Is anyone likeable or without an agenda?  A clever story of love and hate.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I understand that there are many who have gone gah-gah over this series but it just wasn't for me. I am going to see the movie though and hope that I like it better than the book. Now, I really, really enjoyed the TID series which is a little backwards for me. Normally I enjoy the contemporary more than the historical but for some reason this worked out the other way for me.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|Good Cover for the Money, leather, looks nice. 1/2 the price of similar Covers.<br />The only negative is you can't charge your Kindle with the cover closed. This would be a nice feature.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|My wife liked it; I guess that is the important thing The second thing is that, as my headline states, &#34;It is better than any Twi(t)light movie.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is the best since temple run I just don't know why they have to many games with the same meaning yeah u collect things and run away from people or things but where's the fun and for people that really like it stop and think would u really do this in real life.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is a great read.  I wondered who the Ghost was and looked forward to reading his story. I did! Enjoy!!!
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|A good read but very frustrating with its unfinished ending left me wondering if some of the book was not downloaded.
B00874T02K|4.0|Great app and had me on week 2 day 2 already, but there is no tutorial on how to do the exercises properly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The best horse game ever if you dont have it you need to try it out...!!!!!!!<br />Hope you like it to
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This is a violent movie. But one expects that from Tarantino. You cannot help but root for the hero getting revenge for his past horrible treatment. DiCaprio is surprisingly convincing as the villain. If you are not opposed to movie violence and like Tarantino movies this is a must see.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Pretty cool game. Keeps me entertained throughout the day. The game should be able to give the user vertical control though.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|IT SUCKED FROM THE BEGINNING!!! no continuity! no special effects! no energy! no real bad guy! no MANDARIN! 42 armors JUST DESTROYED like tissue paper! NO REASON AT ALL TO WATCH!!! THEY KILLED IRON MAN!
B008602KQI|3.0|In many ways the theme behind the hunger games is more relevant than the actual (2 1/2 hr) movie which does drag on.<br />A few  twists as it goes along but again it feels like it's just setting the viewer up for a sequel.<br />The scenery is beautiful but not spectacular.
B001LF347E|5.0|I had not even seen Season 1 until I bought it.  I came into this show about the end of Season 2.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Yes, she's back. Still great. Expertly produced. I listen to it again and again, but &#34;that's me.&#34; I loved it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game. It's a lot of fun. I hate running out of energy though. It would be nice if you could play without needing energy.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I hesitated to read this book, knowing that, because it was about slavery, it would probably be sad. in fact I put off reading it for quite some time. When I finally did read the book, I could not put it down. The characters were so real and their responses to the situations they were in rang so true. This is a book I will  remember for a long time.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|The move was good but I will say its music is not as great as The Phantom of the Opera music.
1594136238|4.0|The book was as expected, however, it was in large print. I don't know if that was my mistake or not, but it worked out for me.  I would definitely order from this vendor again.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I HONESTLY CANNOT STOP WATCHING THIS MOVIE! Great casting, super funny, and a good storyline. I love love love this movie to death. Rebel Wilson is sooooo funny. GO FAT PATRICIA!
B000A7DVRC|4.0|I ordered this movie to watch with a date since I have always been a fan, but never had a copy.  The story is great, again, a lot of swearing that could have been omitted.  But the concept is spot on and &#34;The Dude&#34; is a trip.  I was cracking up, but my date did not get the humor.  The humor of this movie will only appeal to a select crowd.
B000HZHBIM|2.0|I love all this star trek stuff. It's always exciting and nerdy and a bunch of dudes skyping at each other all mean. But this thing was hard to follow, sorta boring, slow, and nothing seems to REALLY happen. And finding out who the villain was turned out to be about as exciting as in that Jodie Foster movie where the alien turns out to look like her dad. Such a let down. And Matthew mcconaughey plays a surprisingly unconvincing southerner. Weird right? Anyway, I digress. All the other star trek things you can find are better than this. Watch it only if you're a completionist nerd.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Fun movie even for an adult.  Well written and it is humorous throughout the movie.  Safe for kids as well.
B00CISC2DA|3.0|Was going to buy but listened to preview and did some research about the song 'nothing is real' and got to the spoken word about Christ basically lying about eternal life to us. Anyway, I support the right for BOC to say whatever they want and others to listen to whatever they want. But for me, I do not want to support something I totally dont believe in. Maybe I am off base on this and misinterpreted or didnt see the whole picture on this song. If i didnt please explain to me because i wanted to purchase this. Anyway, as a Christian I do believe in questioning, debating and logic to strengthen faith. I think the general gist of this album is we need to protect the earth or we are in deep trouble. I agree with this, just hate that they dissed on Christ. Didnt want to rate album but i had to to post.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|One of the funniest movies I wayched in a long time. I watched this on my ipad on a plane and I struggled to stifle my laughter.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the story and don't want it to end......This book is running neck and neck with Fifty Shades of Grey if not better!!!
B009X01C64|5.0|It's worth spending a little extra, and it's the only case you'll ever need.  It offers great protection and style.  The stand is a great option.  The kindle wakes up when you open the case, and the  microfiber lining protects screen.  Don't forget to purchase the Battery HD Pro ap!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Hensel and Gretel I loved the action then like all the blood and gore the storyline was pretty good so if I have to give it a rating eye with pitted it at two  thumbs.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Can't wait for Season 3. This modern interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes character is extraordinary - from the photography to the writing to the acting. Other TV series pale in comparison.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Hotel Transylvania was really good I liked it a lot so after I rented it on Amazon I went out and bought it and I watched it 3 to 4 times after that. So rating on this one is awesome.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Great home viewing movie. The acting is solid with many great actors. Laughs throughout keep the movie light with enough action to keep it moving along.
B005KAH7QU|2.0|I thought it would been a whole lot better and it was so writing this review here it was worth the rental fee I done through Amazon but going out and buy for the price no way if I can find it for about a couple dollars at a secondhand store video place or something like that yelled them I would buy for the price of $10-$14 would be worth it. So this review is it was okay
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app they are so funny when you run in to something I love the costume you can by in the store with bannanas
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wrecking Ralph was is about a  video game and this cartoon is really good after I rented it on Amazon I went and bought it after I bought it I think I watched at least three times. So this review on this one is totally awesome
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Fun looking back. We have come so far with technology. It is cool some of the techno tricks they pulled off back then.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|The story of beautiful creature never took off the movie only part I liked was when she got her par and she sold her mother in the brick wall with the blinds and he got his memory back low but that's about it. It's worth the $3.99 if you ran it by Vic comes to buying it for $14-$20 it's up to you because I would pay that much for. Rating pretty good
B003O86FMW|3.0|Usually the first book is always better and in this case is really true. The first half of the book is not that good and the second half is almost a replay from the first book, all over again. The good news is that I am reading the third and so far is even worst. A pity.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This would be a good child movie for your kids add love when the good guys beat up on the bad guy pitch and when Frost Jack Frost got became a guardian that was very good. So I give this movie rating of totally awesome
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like to jump so much fun. And its free. Graphics are okay, upgrade system keep making u come back for more, making game addictive.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|Warm body I did like it buy it took little time for it to take off I liked when they put the makeup on him he was arguing with them though he they wasn't and then I liked it when they beat the Skelly's the box skeletons or bony's what the call on the movie and liked when the old man was hitting on that girl in the rain. My rating for this little bit better and the beautiful creatures if I can find it cheap enough around 5 dollars up to $10 I will buy.
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|im scared to get a book off here because i think it will charge me so im gonna try it but if it does charge me im going to be so mad
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Jack the giant slayer it could been just a little bit better the action the storyline but the rate it was all right if I got give it a rating I say pretty good.
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|While it is not what I am used to them doing all cover songs. I really liked the sound of their own material. This is one very gifted bunch of musicians and glad to see that they are finally being recognized for their talents.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|It would be worth the money to go out by it if you like Batman this one is this DVD of dark Knight cartoon it was really really cool I really liked. I give this a rating of excellent.
034580709X|2.0|Yes, a look at the young Harry, some stories about his sister, his family, were interesting. As was the story about how his drinking once cause the death of a co-worker, something that was covered up. But, really, except for a few facts that would have been nice to figure out about Harry earlier, like the right way to pronounce his last name, I could have skipped this one.<br /><br />I will admit I am not a huge fan of Harry. But this Harry is even more annoying than usual, without some of his better qualities, his humor, his sensitivity, that come out in other books and almost makes his likable.<br />While I like a flawed hero as much as the next person, there is something about Harry and his alcoholism that really annoys me, in this book more than in the others. He has not been drinking for a long time as the story start. Then a man he has known for a week dies, and that sets him off on an unbelievable drunken spree. I just don't mean off the wagon. He is off the wagon, rolled in a ditch, fell off the cliff, washed away in a flood... Really, should this guy be a cop, if he falls apart over the death of a guy he liked, but barely knew?<br /><br />The first half of the book is not bad, the plot fairly interesting as Harry starts to discover some facts about this girl's death that had not come out yet, make a few connections. And unlike some readers, I did not mind that the book was set in Australia, rather than in Harry's Norway home. Still, \\"the fascinating continent of Australia\\" they talk about..I would not go that far.<br />But then things went south. There were page after page that could, IMHO, been cut, adding little to the story. Aboriginal dreamtime story after Aboriginal dreamtime which, except for maybe one, had no connection to this story that I ever figured out. Honesty, by then it was all so convoluted, the plot, the characters, that I was losing interest in the who and the why of the killings.<br />And I hate clowns.<br />Beware any book with clowns.<br /><br />If you are a huge fan of Nesbo, you will want to read this.<br />I know you will not be dissuaded. Just knock you expectations down a notch or two, not expecting quite what you liked in his later, better books.r /><br />If you are a huge fan of Nesbo, you will want to read this.<br />I know you will not be dissuaded.

B009GEAPYW|5.0|This first part of the dark Knight it was really good I liked it a lot if I can find it I'm been by it for myself but part two site if you like the dark Knight you would like part one and part two of this DVD because it they are good action cartoons. This rating for this DVD is totally awesome.
B00005JLEU|4.0|The DVD package was cracked when I received it, but the DVD itself works just fine. A truly amazing movie.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Quirky and fun to read!  The action moves fast and keeps the reader entertained.  Would be a good beach read!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I was hoping this book would be a little better but no it wasn't. Holy cow they are just screwed up
B0046UGSNS|1.0|Talk about stereotypes! This pitiful effort at humanizing a possible modern situation is full of them. The only good thing about the movie, which was way too long and painful, is that someone spelled &#34;all right&#34; properly in the title - unusual in this day.
B00846REIS|3.0|I can't decide if I like this book. Eva and Gideon are for real screwed up. They are kind of annoying and all they do is fight and throw their problems in each other's face. 50 shades was much better
B000V86OKG|5.0|As advertised
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The minions are great.  I'm sure all of us know at least one person that looks or acts like one of them.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am so happy that I've read this book. I'm not one for fantasy much but the HBO series is fantastic so I decided to give the books a try. Incredible!  Mr. Martin is an incredible storyteller. He weaves the characters together so beautifully that you totally get lost in their world. Grand in story and style. I'm hooked
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I've never been much of a reader until I read GoT.  I managed to get through all 5 books in about 3 months and I'm considering starting over and reading through it again.  Can't wait for book 6 to come out.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is a lot of fun. I have my own horse at home but I still enjoy playing this game.
B004LROUW2|2.0|I wasn't a fan of this book however I'm not a big fan of sci-fi.  The chapters seemed to drag on and on.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This is a general book ideal to keep you focused on your best. It is simple but powerful when consistently applied.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|I have bought 5 Twyla dolls for all my grandaughters. They absolutly<br />Loved them! The dolls were a complete hit with them and &#34;Gramma&#34; was a<br />HIT WITH THEM TOO.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|The movie is slow but its worth it !! Matt Damon has carried the role very well.<br />Would recommend to anyone interested in lawyer type movies.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|As always, very entertaining. My only complaint is that it seems to follow the same formula as the others but then again that has been proven so I don't know what could be done to change things.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Having read the authors previous two amazing books I expected to be a bit disappointed but I was wrong. You are gripped from chapter 1-it's one of the best books I've read in years. A true tale of friendship that takes you on an amazing journey of emotions.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I thought I was going to love it but after two puzzles I couldn't get it open to play any additional puzzles. A waste of time
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have been a die hard fan of the southern vampire novels. The last few have been declining in quality, and this one brings the series to a spectacularly bad, bad conclusion..... Soooooo disappointed in both the plot, writing and conclusion to what was one of my favorite book series, this one almost ruins them all for me :(
B000M341QE|5.0|The cast is wonderful. Great acting! Powerful dialogue and unexpected plot twists. Matt Damon delivers an explosive performance: so believable!  DiCaprio is at his best! I recommend this movie to those who are interested in gangster flicks! I ordered this movie for my husband's birthday present and he was thrilled to receive this as one of his gifts from me. We enjoyed wathcing it together. Thanks!
B00000G6H1|5.0|The remastered sound is great. The music sounds like it was recorded recently, so happy with it. Been waiting for this remastered version for 8 months, because of back order, worth the wait!
B00BN4JQ6G|1.0|Ya know, I loved the KOL. Molly's Chambers, Sex On Fire (great tune for a KY Warming Gel commercial, just sayin'), Use Somebody...  and I have the same Sheraton as Matthew, so I felt a special  bond.  Who makes it big and still plays an Epi.  Cool.<br /><br />So, joined the fan club, bought Sundown, ready for the tour, and bingo, they are coming to Western New York.  I get SRO tickets, in a special, front of the stage area for me and my Wife.<br /><br />Then, the implosion.  Tour Cancelled.  Hopes dashed.<br /><br />These fellas owe me an apology before I consider buying some box set.  Front row.  Man, we were almost there.  And then, someone couldn't hold his liquor.  I have been in bands since I was 15, and I have never, ever missed a show.  I have played with a fever, a cold sore, and a hangover.  But I am there for the schlubbs that want to see my band and heckle the bass player, ya know?<br /><br />Never again, KOL. Never again.
B00005MP58|5.0|I love this movie, and have watched this particular edition a minimum of 20 times. There is only one thing that drives me crazy. (Warning: I'm about to reveal part of the movie.)<br /><br />At one point, when Lydia is to be married from Cheapside, Jane says \\"Oh, poor Kitty will be disappointed not to be a bridesmaid.\\" Then why wasn't Kitty a bridesmaid for Jane and Elizabeth's double wedding? If she would be so disappointed, then why would they disappoint her again? This has never made sense to me. :( If someone has any opinions on this, I would welcome them.<br /><br />Other than this small tidbit, I love love love this movie.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love the series so far. It's addictive and I watched the whole thing in a week or two. Highly recommended!
0312330537|5.0|I read 3 to 8 books a week. This novel is one of the best I've ever read! It did what a good book should--took me to another place--an exciting, devastating, shocking Bombay. Adventure, friendships, intrigue and pain. It has it all!!
B007T99ENE|3.0|I was disappointed with the ending. It just ended suddenly as if the author had runout of ideas for the plot. I loved the story and the style, just wished it didn't end so suddenly.
0060555661|5.0|THe cover looks pretty cool, and seeing as I always judge books bu the cover then this book must be spectacular.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This may be the most sophisticated soap opera ever.  There are so many different stories within but I'm still able to follow it.  The acting is great and I like that there are English and Americans both.  And the settings and scenery is just awesome.  I'm only sorry about Matthews demise and hope that the upcoming seasons will be the same caliber as the first 3.
B008YRTWM8|5.0|Spike Lee is a prince, and he owns his element. His flare for basketball is obvious, but he doesn't let his passion for the sport trounce the importance of the story. He also makes some key concessions about the limit of basketball, and the strains it sets on the father-son relationship. Watch it.
B00AJAFNIA|3.0|This was a cute game.  Not sure if I would have paid money for it.  But for being free it was awesome!
0393317552|5.0|Listen, this book is factually heavy, and J.D. tends to prefer to cover the tenets of history that support his argument over the most philosophically interesting pieces. There are literally like 50 pages on ancient agriculture techniques, which were rather limited. Also, the thesis rests on the foundation that the Europeans have ruled the world since around 1200, which can be a tad offensive/ridiculous to non-whites. Other than that, this book is absolutely interesting, and reads well
B0097K21YW|2.0|Wasn't that great.  Glad it was free.  But wouldn't pay for it.  There are much better games out there to buy.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The children really enjoy angry birds. It plays really well on the Kindle and the children really like it alot.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|Very addicting.  I like the Cut the Rope.  This just adds to it.  If you like Cut the Rope, get this game.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Just downloaded this one on the Kindle, but my children have played it a few times. I wish you didn't have to be connected to facebook or anything to play real games.
B00AQM8H9I|2.0|This game was alright.  There are much better games out there though.  Don't pay real money for it.  Not one penny.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Best game ever get it!it's hours of fun My friend kodee told me about it and it was fun to listen but once you pass the 11 stage you have to write a review!?it said there's some difficulties also it might need a few fixtures here and there but other wise it's great
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Well this was  a very fun game that I enjoyed, but I only played it twice when it stopped working!! I've tried to redownload this game several times, but it never worked again. I have a kindle fire hd, and if you do to and are wanted to get this game, I wouldn't. Doesn't work.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|I selected this rating on &#34; couldn't put it down basis&#34;.  Archer's style is unique although a book finishes on a question which is only answered in the next book. I just had to hop into the next book in the series to find that answer.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't get enough of this.... I watched the first 3 seasons in two weeks  after catching the season finale on Sunday evening.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it great action ,graphics , and super cute . I love the cute minions. This epic game is challenging, you can also challenge your Facebook friends .
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I just got a replacement kindle and db updated and I really like the update for a change! It works
B005EHILV4|5.0|Although I am pretty savvy in the ways of electronics, RF, and such, I really am not very experienced in the ways of even hobbyist grade audio work. Needing a small, portable mixer WITH a preamp to use on a dynamic vocal mic, I decided to try the 302USB.<br /><br />Note that this is not a professional or audiophile application (since I'm not an audio pro), and I am not expecting such a low-priced mixer to be perfect. Reviews seemed pretty good, although varied on how well the mic preamp would work. So far, I have not used the USB audio capability of the mixer, but anticipate that I will later. Being USB powered offers a lot of flexibility, as there are myriad USB power sources, including battery powered. Many of the mixer, even the small ones require an AC adapter with no easy provision for running from 12VDC.<br /><br />As it turns out, the 302USB has more than ample performance in the preamp section for a GLS ES-58 (Shure SM58 clone). The 2-band EQ is kind of handy, and the pan control allows placement of the mic signal in the audio field which is handy, but is a capability I probably won't use.<br /><br />After I have more time using the 302USB, I will provide more in-depth observations. But initially, I think it's a very decent little mixer for the money. It's sturdy and well-featured. I anticipate eventually using this for some voice-over/narration/podcast type work, and it seems like it should do very well in that application.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I have to say it was certainly worth the wait. I know some people write elaborate reviews. I'm keeping this simple. The best book in the series! A must read.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I like to read and have few games on my KFHD.  I bought this app with free 'coins' received from Amazon and all I can say is Wow.  I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzles, the graphics and the sound effects.  Maybe it's because I don't play games but I was just amazed at the imagination and creativity of the developers.<br /><br />If there are more games out there like this I want to find them, and you can be sure I'll be looking for more Rooms.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Not what I expected. Would like Candy Crush Saga for Kindle . I downloaded the game on phone and thought I was getting the same here. Disappointed!
0425263924|1.0|Very disappointed with the whole book and specially the ending !!!<br />What else is going to happen similar to 50 shades of grey? if the author were a good one, she could invent new side stories...<br />As for me, Sylvia Day, I am, as another reader, \\"finished with you\\"!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|In Follett's signature ability to grip us we are also illuminated with accurate historical sketches of early 20th Century told in the context of both warm and raw human relations.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book for something easy to read on a summer afternoon.  The ending was a little bit of a surprised to me.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I could play this for hours, if I could get my Kindle Fire back from my kids!  Always a crowd pleaser.
B005P89F1C|3.0|I DID NOT WANT THESE FOR ME, THEY WERE GIFT  I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING OF HIS FOR ME<br />HIS IMAGE HAS CHANGED. DRAGGING PANTS ABOUT T FALL OFF , ACTING CRAZY
B004VOBIE8|1.0|Seemed very nice for a couple weeks, then it said \\"Internet Needed\\".  Happened on the same day that File Manager HD (that I paid for) by the same developer stopped working in the same way.  If it requires an internet connection, even part of the time, it should say so in the Amazon listing. If it had I never would have downloaded. I realize the app has permission to access the network, that's different than a requirement to access the network.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons continue to be one of my favorites. I don't need to fast forward through the songs to find something to listen to....I love them all.
B0078XGJQQ|5.0|Having read The Secret and working on The Power I jumped to get this when it came out.  Of the three books this is my favorite.  It is short and to the point and following the 28 Days Daily Magic Practice has helped totally change my mindset.  With very little time daily you can really redirect your focus.  Love it!  Thank you Rhonda Byrne for another inspiring life changing read.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I read &#34;City of Bones&#34; first and I could tell this was the beginning of great story(fiction).  The second book &#34;City of Ashes) really drives deep into the world of the shadowhunter.  This book really starts to explain and detail the whole downworlder order and how things work.  All of the characters become close and you begin to understand the many differences between them all and why..  Clary begins to mature, grow and begins her journey into becoming a gifted shadowhunter with a special power.  Jace becomes and even more powerful shadow hunter and I don't believe he is Clary's brother, just a feeling.  Valentine is evil in our way of looking at things but he believes that his goal is moral and is driven with a single purpose, to rid the world of ?????(For you to discover).This is a story that just keeps getting better and I have starterd &#34;City of Glass&#34; today.  I really enjoy Cassandra Clare's writing.  I think I will be reading her other stories as well after I finish the Mortal Instrument series.  I look forward to watching the first movie in August.  I hope they don't ruin the story and the movie, like hollywood did with the &#34;Beautiful Creatures&#34; Series; those books were fantastic too.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I purchased this book out of curiousity after seeing the title.  I loved this book.  John Locke was easy to read and gave great tips and useful information on how to give writing a go.  The book flows and I found I finished it very quickly but still felt I had gained from it.  I went on to purchase his novels to see what they are like and he was right in his self description.  His marketing strategy works and helps encourage other would be writers give it a go.  Worth much more than the purchase price.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A great script and story line. Very well acted...one can relate to many of the problems encountered (money aside of course).  We really enjoy the series.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|This cover of the Marvel comic Thor was very entertaining.  Having read the comics and being familiar with the characters,  I was pleasantly surprised by how closely the director traced them to the comics. Excellent production design, good pacing and selection of cast. Thumbs up indeed!
B0025KVLTW|5.0|loved this product! great music, great band, if you are a beatles fan this cd is a must! you need to add it to your collections
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I had read the captain America comics in my youth and was very familiar with the characters and storyline. The cast was well chosen and the selection of the great Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull was excellent.  Establishing the plot and pacing was well done. The production drsign was believable.  Two thumbs up.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Please hurry and get more levels. I really enjoy playing this game. Love the challenge and the graphics are awesome as well.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Crappy game, balls fire when they should not. Money pit just to keep playing, since they want you to keep buying extra lives. I don't want this app, not even for free!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the Crossfire story, can not wait for the release of the next book...please hurry up an publish it. Eva and Gideon ... Can't wit to read what happen with Nathan case, and the trip to San Diego.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Just Love the movie, well put together and with as many &#34;name brand&#34; actors playing in it there is no one that is a screen hog.
1417725079|5.0|I loved this book. I had seen the original movie not long ago and was interested in reading the story as written. I was not disappointed. The characters are all interesting and multi-layered. There is drama and laughter at times as well as numerous passages that just make you think. I expect I will read it many times over.
1401922732|5.0|I've been going through a very hard time since last fall, and as a way to get through it, I've been trying to reconnect with my spirituality.  Recently, a tarot reader told me that Archangel Michael was a very strong presence in my life.  She did not know that several weeks before, I had purchased an amulet with the sigil of Michael on it.  Also, the color of Michael is my favorite color.  When I saw these cards, I knew I had to get them.  They are quite beautiful.  Last night I tried my first reading, and it was uncanny.  I have been questioning whether or not I made the right decision about a situation, and I have been spending time trying o meditate, and have been asking for Spirit and the Archangels to show me signs any time....even in my dreams.  The first card that came up was THE PERSON YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT IS TRUSTWORTHY.  After looking it up in the book, it says that the card is stating that my idea is valid and trustworthy, me being the person involved.  The second card was BELIEVE AND TRUST. The prayer on it says to ask Archangel Michael to enter my dreams and replace fear with trust.  It also means for me to believe and trust in myself.  The third card was PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR DREAMS, which again talks about asking Michael to teach and heal me in my dreams....and that he's there, even if I don't remember it.<br /><br />Kind of awesome, isn't it?
B008JFUOWM|5.0|The special effects are more over-the-top but riveting. They include a tank and a plane as shown in the trailer.<br /><br />The action scenes are quick, decisive and interesting. The fight between the two women in the first 30 minutes is one of the best of its kinds.<br /><br />The pace is fast.<br /><br />Justin Lin's directing is smooth and entertaining.<br /><br />The Rock's and Vin's acting are engaging.<br /><br />There are more twists in this movie than the previous one. I did not see them coming. They make it more intriguing.<br /><br />It has some characters' depth relating to Vin Diesel's love and Paul Walker's wife and baby.<br /><br />Of course, I had to put my logic to sleep in order to enjoy this film.<br /><br />UPDATED July 28, 2013<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot come, below are the financial figures of this movie:<br />Production Budget: $160 million<br />Domestic:  $235,741,645<br />+ Foreign:  $460,000,000<br />= Worldwide:  $741,099,000<br /><br />That's a gigantic amount.<br /><br />In short, it's ONE of the BEST that my MONEY CAN GET in terms of action, car stunts,  special effects and entertainment.

B004RJMUJO|4.0|I'd had the free version first, then decided to just get the paid app. I won't say it's not worth it, but I don't regret getting it either. It's a perfect way to kill time, and if you're more like me, unlocking all the swords and backgrounds will definitely keep you busy for a few days.
B0011ZWKSS|4.0|good mix of ambiant, classical piano, electronic beats with some soulfull vocals making this LP perfect summertime mood enhancement for chilling or working out to
B008JGSM6G|5.0|An awesome game so addictive, you won't even see it coming. I dare you to play only one grid. Go on, try it.
0802473156|5.0|I know we all feel we know how to love people, especially our special person. However, have you ever thought that you may be speaking a Love Language that your honey does not understand?<br /><br />I have found this book (not finished yet) to be very enlighting to some things that may be obvious to others, but sometimes not to everyone.<br /><br />I find it as a refreshing approach to asking yourself, not what are you doing wrong, but what can you do differently.  Maybe the reason things are going in the direction they are, is simply because you two are speaking two different languages. It doesn't make one right and the other wrong, just different.<br /><br />So, if you're someone who likes to learn more of how to make your relationship/marriage even better, I strongly suggest that you get this book.<br /><br />Live, Laugh & Love<br />Scrappin' Mocha Diva
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|This was a birthday gift for a friend.<br /><br />Absolutely adorable and worth more than just one viewing.<br />It was shipped and delivered in time to watch on her birthday.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded this for my daughter on her Kindle. We own this on my I-phone and it worked great. Sadly it does not work on the Kindle. Hopefully the app will be updated and the kinks will be worked out.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|The review header pretty much says it all. Definitely a good way to kill time while waiting for class to start. I had downloaded it to my kindle, and I could see how it might be a little awkward for someone who might want to play on their phone. Or maybe it's just me and my fat fingers.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|As a non-fan, I was amazed at how I was able to get into the story, understand the backstory, and enjoy the movie itself. Although it is not life-changing, it is extremely entertaining.
B003XFVSTG|5.0|As far as the movie itself goes, it has to be one of my favorite musicals ever. Powerful, and moving, with an amazing cast of characters. To all skeptics, it's definitely worth a shot.<br /><br />I do have one small nitpick with the actual streaming though. I paid for HD, which is only a dollar more than standard def, but it is what I expected to watch. In order to keep my streaming smooth however, I was downgraded to SD. Not something I was very happy with. I paid for HD, Amazon, and that's what I expected. As much as I appreciate your consideration, I would have rather paused the movie to let it buffer out a bit, than to pay for something and not get it.<br /><br />Despite that though, the movie itself still deserves 5 stars
B009FZHYKU|3.0|This is the only bad season yet. I've loved the series up until now. Can someone please just shoot the governor. Hopefully season 4 is better than this. Really let down and now I have to wait until October to find out.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|A most superbly done, totally touching movie about the friendship of two small boys, one the lonely concentration camp director's son and the other a boy in the camp, it is one of my favorite movies. Especially at the movies surprising ending, be prepared for a few tears. I just read a review by the director of the Holocaust Museum who says this is a made up story. If anyone should know, she should. It was still a very touching movie. I did wonder why the boy in the camp could get to the fence without being caught.
B008476HBM|4.0|This book was very compelling and well written. It caught my attention and the ending was perfect. Overall, a good classic worth reading.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The movie was a well done look at a tremendously talented Jewish pianist and the trials that he suffered under the Nazi's. Tremendously lucky as well as totally talented, He survived the war to play in some of the finest concert halls. I highly recommend it.

B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Every song on this CD will have you on your feet and dancing.  This original soundtrack, performed by the actors themselves, is masterfully mixed.  And Cruise's raunchy, sexy rendition of Pour Some Sugar On Me -- well, lets just say it will have you in a sticky sweet sweat!!! YUM!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this app helps younger kids to learn about the would about horses. I have been improving with my ridding just by playing this app.;)

B002ZB26AO|4.0|Unbelievable stories of three people who manage to get out of North Korea. Incredible details, written so beautifully, that you feel their pain. That this happens in today's world makes it even more astonishing.
B005LN5UOC|1.0|So, I looked over all the reviews here and thought I'd try out this cool looking headset. But when I connected it and started using it online, I was absolutely amazed at how bad it was, there was crackling on both ends(mic & speaker, it sounded liked the other players voices were speaking through a motorcycle helmet it sounded SO muffled and vice versa when I asked how I sounded, just a bad product, Stick with your old PS3 Sony Headset, its really not all that bad til you try one of these...<br /><br />On a positive note, a 5 Star rating for Amazon, They are Fully refunding me for this unit.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large numbers and easy to read.  Good for us old people who have to get the other glasses to read.  You don't have to do that with this one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book. I think the author grasped what a young girl with cancer would be going through. Heart-breaking. Well written. Thanks for the look inside the head of this young lady.
B0092EE5HY|4.0|Just read it!<br /><br />There is a different side of G.R.R. Martin that you must read. It is so different from the Game of Thrones many of use have first some to know him by.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Great album.  Highlights the range of Darius Rucker's talents.  Not a bad song on the CD.  Think his voice sounds much better doing country.
0307730700|5.0|Eric Blehm keeps you spell bound by the struggles and tremendous accomplishments of Navy Seal Adam Brown.  How you fight drug addiction and achieve the highest level of a Seal while being blind in your dominant eye and with an injury to your dominate hand can only be explained by the late Adam Brown.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Great album.  Andrea doesn't disappoint and the duet partners are well chosen and compliment his voice nicely.  Not a back track on this CD.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|We love reading books on our ipads. I guess we need to put them down and talk, but we have so many books to read.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I tried to play with a stylus and it would make incorrect moves.  It would release or not go to where the stylus was placed.  Very frustrating!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game that has great graphics. my son really loves it and thinks it is easy to play. great game.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Every person young and old needs to read this book.  I will use the line, \\"Be nicer than necessary.\\" with my students.  It will be our class motto.  Brilliantly written and a great reminder that beauty comes in all different types of packages.  Open your eyes to all and be kind.
B003HC8I5M|5.0|Wasn't disappointed.  Great CD to listen to in the office.  It was great to hear his versions of some of my favorite MOTOWN sounds.
B0071NOU78|5.0|My 4 year old grandson is a Star Wars expert.  He knows all the chacters and the color of their light sabers. He loved the lightsaber,  Noe he has all the colors..
B008Y5OW20|5.0|What a great collection of songs.  If you like Jeff Lynne, you'll be blown away by this CD.  Every song is awesome, not one you'll want to skip.  The chords and harmony in the song \\"She\\" are just unbelievable.  Get this CD, you won't be disappointed!
0099549050|2.0|I was under the impression I would get the entire novel. What I received was only Book 3.  I had returned the book to the library unfinished and was having this sent to my summer address in Germany.  It's not even the part I was on, so I can't finish the book.  1Q84 is a good book  I just didn't get what I expected.  I just reordered the entire novel from another vendor for almost what I paid for this useless book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Cant get enough of my minion rush!!! Just plain old fashioned awesome fun. Can play for hours and hours. Just wish costumes cost less and had more opportunities to earn lots of coins.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Really don't understand why people think this band is going to sound like they did with Rated R and SFTD. Those albums were over 10 years ago. If you expect bands not to change their sound, grow up. Every one of QOTSA's album have a different tone. I'd say this one is up there with Rated R. Its definitely their slickest album. The vocals sound cleaner and there aren't as many long rifts.<br /><br />Only two things I don't like. Little too slow for me, 3 slower songs out of 10 is a little too much. And its a little short with 10 songs. Only part of the album I'm not fond of is the beginning of Smooth Sailing but other than that...flawless. So I like 45 of the 46 minutes.<br /><br />For a band who's gone thru so much change and interchangeable pieces (on purpose), Queens of the Stone Age have kept their edge and attitude. I give it a solid 9. I'm happy they FINALLY got some mainstream attention too, finally hitting #1.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Great read in conversational tone.  James just tells it like he sees it, inspiring you to make your like better.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|No tutorial on how to play, so you have to guess what to do. Once you do figure it out, it's not worth the time! For a free app it's not even worth the time to install.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great beach book! I read it for 4 hrs straight while lounging at the beach - a perfect day altogether.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I hate the new update, I don't want a weather app that earns points or has advertisements since the update I have removed it.  I had to rate the update to submit my review but I'd give it less than a zero if it were possible.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Pitch perfect is a wonderfully fun, uplifting, and clever movie.  I highly enjoyed watching this with my family and friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it is a awesome game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.do you guys love it because I know that I do.what is your wording of what you think
B00000ILGL|5.0|This disco gem by Giorgio Moroder was recorded, in Germany, in June 1977. I would like to offer my review & opinions of each song, as follows:<br /><br />1.  \\"From Here To Eternity\\"...This is DISCO @ it's very finest. Excellent music, beat & the female voices & everything else is just perfect. NOTE: there is one instrumental part, which is a lot like \\"Fairy Tale High\\", by Donna Summer, from HER 1977 album \\"Once Upon A Time\\".<br /><br />2.  \\"Faster Than The Speed Of Love\\"...I love the computerized voice on this song.  It's very short in it's length, but it's a great song.<br /><br />3.  \\"Lost Angeles\\"...I also call THIS song \\"Lost In The Stars\\".  And once again, I love the vocals & the music.<br /><br />4.  \\"Utopia-Me Giorgio\\"...Hardly any words here, just great music, accompanied by female vocal chants.<br /><br />5.  \\"From Here To Eternity (Reprise)\\"...The VERY shortest song here & it's a continuation of Song #1 w/ more of a Vocal CHANT.  Just like myself, I'm sure that MANY others have noticed that songs 1 through 5 are very SIMILAR.  They ALL form one HUGE medley OR sequence.<br /><br />6.  \\"First Hand Experience In Second Hand Love\\"...I have always LOVED this song, very much. Even though, it has a SLOWER beat, I really think it's great. This mellow cut & feeling always reminds me of a LAST CALL song @ the club. And also a LATE NIGHT song, as a party winds on down.<br /><br />7.  \\"I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone\\"...I wasn't too nuts about this song @ first, but it has really GROWN on me, through out the years.  It's kinda SIMILAR to \\"First Hand Experience In Second Hand Love\\", but NOT as good, though.  It's good, in it's OWN right, anyway.<br /><br />8.  \\"Too Hot To Handle\\"...I've always liked this song, very much too.<br /><br />I had forgotten about this album, somewhat, when it was ORIGINALLY released in '77. Then in 1982, a few of my friends played this album again & I remembered it, immediately.  I still have this record, but I decided to get this album,on a CD format.  So, I ordered this CD on July 5, 2013 & it's really great to hear this music & have this album, again.  For all those who loved 70's disco @ it's finest, this album is most definitely recommended.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good story. The individual’s struggle dealing with the reality around him & his mental issues. The struggle his family & friends are facing while still trying to support him on the road to recovery. Quick & easy read. But the movie over hyped it I think.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Its great and when I don't play it I just feel sp so diffrent o don't know why but in 2 seconds. Start playing again  becaise I love this bubble game even thou that some levels are hard
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Wonderful movie with great pacing.  There's always action filled with bits of comedy which gives great movement in the story.  Great cast.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is on of the best games I have every played, I only hate that it took forever to download.
B000T46NOE|5.0|Love Hellboy, Never gets old or boring. Characters played are great and feel similar to hellboy great movie to watch more then once
B000001FKY|5.0|If you're into this type of music, Def Leppard's Hysteria is absolutely one of the finest productions of all time.  It's definitely in my top 10 favorites.  It's cheesy 80's hairband stuff, but it's one of those albums where every song is good and you know all the lyrics to each one.  The production and recording is crisp and polished, the hooks are non-stop, and although you'll roll your eyes at some of the lyrics, you'll be smiling and enjoying it anyway.
B001OFJPIS|5.0|love it, both part two and part one is truly amazing. really want them to make a part three please
B000002LK1|5.0|This is the BEST Depeche Mode has ever released.  Nothing comes close.  This album is definitely in my top 10 all-time list.  Enjoy the Silence, Policy of Truth and Halo are my favorites.  The album flows very well.  It's the only DM release that I can tolerate all of Martin Gore's painful vibrato.  The lyrics, mood and music all make it easier to digest.  If Dave sung every song and Martin was just there for harmonies and backups, DM would be so much better.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was disappointed that I was led to believe this was a trilogy and then find out at the end that it was not.  I waited a VERY long time for this book to be released and was excited for a happy ending to the story.  Instead, I felt cheated and will probably have to wait another year before I find out what the future holds for the couple.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This bible has excellent lesson plans for whatever the subject matter of interest is. It is structured in a way that is simplistic. I especially like the features that keep me on track in my lesson planning.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Even with the video intro I still couldn't figure out how to play it...so I don't. Perhaps if the video went a little slower or there was more explanation on how to play.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|For as long as the US government continues to keep its records about the real facts behind JFK's murder shut (apparently they have to wait for the last conspirator to die before they can open its records --God forbid having to put a handful of murderers in jail for the assassination of the President!), this will continue to be one of the best collections of information about the reasons (and the possible perpetrators) for a crime that can be considered, for all practical purposes, a Coup d'&eacute;tat. If Oliver Stone got a fraction of his facts right, he still did a much better job than any Government sponsored initiative ever did to shed some light on one of the most shameful episodes of American History.<br /><br />Aside from that, it is a beautifully shot movie, well written, well acted (Kevin Costner at its best!) and well produced. It deserved a lot more Oscars than it actually won (and that it probably didn't win for being so controversial and defiant to the official BS about JFK's killing).
B002LC8HF0|4.0|Action right from the start, the story line moved along smoothly, some surprising twists towards the end.  Much better  read than book two.  Somebody would need to read all three books to get the true value of Brandon Sanderson's art of writing.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really like this game. Even better than subway surfers ... IF it would stop messing up!! Game ran great at first. Once I reached the next level it started freezing and locking up my whole kindle. Now when I choose the game it acts like it's loading only to return me to my carousel. PLEASE fix it!! Even my three year old likes to play.
B003MC5N28|5.0|It was a comtpelling read, and very thought provoking. Our book club enjoyed discussing this classic work. I highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I'm enjoying the game so far. I finished a few rounds &amp; then was prompted to rate the game in order to continue playing which I don't like but I'll see if I get to continue.
1781162646|5.0|This was my first Stephen King read.  I was surprised by the outstanding witty writing style and the mystery threads he wove together.  It was top notch from beginning to end.  Story of a coming of age for a young man as well as a wonderful mystery with a surprising ending. Hard to put down.
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|I play on a fire HD. Graphics are jumpy when using a sniper scope and the shots often hit not where I am aiming. I prefer shooting to using grenades but the health bar goes quick forcing a restart, pay for revive or pay for armor. I would rather have paid for the game than be hassled to spend money all the time.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love this game. its fun and I cant put it down. yes its like temple run but way better. you should try it. its free. and the cute penguins make it more enjoyable.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|Fast shipping and great packaging.  My daughter loved this!  She has been a fan of the Jonas Brothers for several years and was not disappointed!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Great game, you really feel like your in WW2! Some levels could be more challenging. I really do enjoy this game very much.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun but so short. More please.  I would pay for this app.  But you can't beat free.  Great reviews grabbed me. So glad I tried it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I LOVE THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT BOOK OF THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ!!!:) (:
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This app keeps crashing and needs some work.  Not up to Despicable Me standards. They need to replace the minions that wrote this and get new ones that know how to make a game that works.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I liked book two, in as much as it moved this epic saga along.  It was not as compelling as book one.  this critique is somewhat tainted having seen the HBO version and clearing those images from my head is a difficult task, as the story I had been drawn to, varies from the book.
B002RI98BA|5.0|Although slow at the beginning, it became impossible to cast aside.  It is a wonderful story of a great human, his achievements, his associates and his time in the history of the USA.  A moving story of a brilliant politician and a true humanitarian.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is a world of blocks where you can build many things out of blocks but the updates are not getting to people fast enough and we still don't have the multiplayer for minecraft app
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wonderful game. I just love it. Keeps me guessing I hope they make more levels.<br />You should try it. It's amazing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When Subway Surfers first came out, most Temple Runners made the switch. This switch it still happening. The game is addicting, fun, and keeps you on your toes, enhancing your mental agility capabilities, proving that Subway Surfers is better and more people should play. If you don't like the game, your could always delete it!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Not what I expected. Which is a good thing. A good mystery and ending.I am going to read his other books now since this story was really good.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I enjoyed this book from beginning to end, in fact I hated to see it end. The characters are well-drawn and full of magic, as is the story. I began reading it again as soon as I finished.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|It's difficult to review albums, because music is subjective and some people will love it and some will not.  I felt compelled to leave a review of this record, because I pre-ordered it and have spent a lot of time listening to it and it is more than I had hoped for, and everything I wanted it to be.  I know there are some who don't appreciate the recording and Bill Ward's absence and I respect those views, but for me, this album is simply wonderful.  It is everything I have always loved about Black Sabbath and in a world of hard rock music that is mulled over by bad vocals, 8 string guitars and lyrics about blow jobs and pig guts, this is everything a hard rock fan like myself has ached for.<br /><br />Tony's guitar work on this album is stellar, the man is and always will be one of the best hard rock riff-masters in the game, he can take something so seemingly simple and make it complex and just fantastic.  The tone is Zeitgeist, the solo, the way he hangs back, it's just gorgeous, the acoustic intro of Methademic, and the 'rolling' riff he is famous for in Peace of Mind, is everything that made him a legend in his own lifetime.  The bass on God Is Dead reminded me of how often I hear bass players talk about Geezer's influence on them, and I understand why.  Wow, the bass in that song is amazing.  Ozzy sounds amazing, some have complained that it is layered with studio effects.  I scratch my head and ask, so?  This is a studio album, not a live performance.  I also have to remark I found the lyrics typical Sabbath and wonderful:  revolution, good vs. evil, space exploration, all of these are typical subject matter for Sabbath.  No one does it better.<br /><br />I should also add that the deluxe version is the absolute way to go, the extra songs are NOT throw-aways or B-sides.  They shine like the rest of the record.  I can't find a bad track on this album.<br /><br />Download these and save yourself!<br /><br />Zeitgeist (what an atmospheric song)<br />Live Forever (fantastic chorus, I can never get it out of my head)<br />Age of Reason (fantastic riffing and great lyrics)<br />Peace of Mind<br />Pariah (just fantastic all around)<br />Damaged Soul (here you will find the harmonica, and the easy laid back jam type style that Black Sabbath does so well)<br /><br />I am so thankful they recorded this record and hope they record another soon.r (fantastic chorus, I can never get it out of my head)<br />Age of Reason (fantastic riffing and great lyrics)<br />Peace of Mind<br />Pariah (just fantastic all around)<br />Damaged Soul (here you will find the harmonica, and the easy laid back jam type style that Black Sabbath does so well)<br /><br />I am so thankful they recorded this record and hope they record another soon.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I own one of these as well as the full sized Weber chimney starter, and I find myself reaching for this one whenever I need to add a few coals to the larger grill to extend cooking time. Compared to the larger chimney, it's lighter, smaller in diameter and seems to be a little faster at starting a smaller number of briquettes. It should be perfect for a smaller grill.
B007HLIUN4|3.0|This book contains a mass of interesting detail and advances an important and topical thesis - namely that inclusive economic and political systems work better than exclusive, extractive ones. Unfortunately it is massively repetitive but fails to consider the extent to which the &#34;First World&#34; in general, and the US in particular, is moving from an inclusive to an exclusive system.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I opened it this morning and it has new features that at first looked good.  After running the motion map it froze and I needed to reboot.  Needs a little QA &pi;
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Overall very good, a little slow at times for my taste.<br />More action or suspense would have moved it along a little better.
0553381407|1.0|Bad advice.  And, if your therapist suggests you read it, think again.  Better yet, get another therapist.  It will do more harm than good for you and your relationships.  There are numerous other books out there that don't push the \\"blame game\\" and that will actually offer sound solutions on healing and forgiveness.  No parent is given an instruction manual, they all do the best they can given the information they have...it doesn't mean your parents don't love or are bad parents to be blamed.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I  played it fine yesterday and I really like it and today it doesn't work<br /> Anymore. Please fix I got far.
B00847KFDS|5.0|The best songs ever with new twists and new voices.  Especially like that this album is not over-produced, straightforward music and voices.  Great fun with new arrangements and every duet is super.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|It seems that the writing for this season has been driven more by expiring contracts than by creativity and plot development. Edith came into her own this season. Maggie Smith is always worth the price of admission. But the number of characters killed off has left a rather tawdry and implausibly Gothic palette with which to carry the series forward. Too bad the producers could not have locked in option extensions for actors to allow for reasonable and coherent exits and entrances. Will look for next season, but with far less anticipation than before.
B0077PBPJ6|3.0|It should have stuck to one story or another.  I really dislike war movies that try to inject a romantic subplot especially when we inject the stereotypical unsupportive female character who makes the guy feel like he might as well just go off and take needless risks to off himself.  Pretty good realism I think in the war scenes.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Sherlock Holmes are great short reads, and combining them ALL in one 99 cent ebook was a grand idea! word
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have so much fun on this app and never get bored! I was kind of jiffy about it at first but after getting into it, its really addictive and not at all what I expected. its more!(:
0345529057|5.0|I have absolutely nothing to complain about. Actually, the books arrived sooner than i expected (Brazil), good quality, easy reading.<br />Involving and epic story. I would recommend for everyone who intends to spend some time in a good reading!
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|\\"Quartet\\" is a sweet, romanticized tale about talented musicians in their golden years. What happens when a successful, long career on stage has reached its end? When youth and vigor have slipped into the unavoidable issues of aging? The residents of a bucolic (fictional) retirement home in the English countryside may be dealing with limitations following a stroke, or even mild dementia, but they aren't alone or completely forgotten. Music is still an important part of their everyday lives.<br /><br />On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this movie a solid 7. \\"Quartet\\" isn't a deep movie, and having had relatives in assisted living/nursing homes it clearly shows an idealized, unrealistic depiction of retirement homes in general, but it's pleasant and even funny entertainment with some very nice music.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I just got it, but so far it is really fun!!!! And I'm glad that is it free. Definitely worth it!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book, excellent story very steamy,tense, and emotional. Well developed characters and pacing. Would recommend to any avid romance reader.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game. I like how  you can unlock and upgrade different armors at Stark Industries. The special attacks are the really amazing. I would recommend this game for anyone who likes Iron Man or Marvel.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|this game is fun, but I don't like how essential components of the game cost gems that cost real money. ponies that you need to complete the game (I'm looking at you, rarity and rainbow dash) should cost bits.<br /><br />anyway, I'm sure you're all waiting for this:<br /><br />add me!! s'alright is my gameloft id.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This works fine for my Kindle.  Loads quickly, plays easily and is big enough I don't need a pointer to move things along - my finger works great.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This series has it all for maximum entertainment.<br />From politics, court room strategies, office antics to personal relationships, the lines get blurry and even crossed at times but subject matter is real and relatable. Watch one episode and you're hooked.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I saw one episode of The Good Wife on a Continental Airlines flight about 2 years ago and thought, that was a good show I should start to watch it.  Two years later I see it available on Prime.  I love it.  Good writing, some plot twists.  I breezed through the first 3 seasons in 2 weeks.  It's a good legal/family drama, give it a try.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is like temple run and subway suffers its better then all of them and its cool and awsome I like it!
B00DGN51O8|4.0|This film certainly wasn't made to win Oscars, but it was solidly entertaining to watch.  It was an interesting retelling of a well-known story, and I thought the concept was very good; however, it just seemed like there was a little something missing in the execution that I couldn't put my finger on.  When you see a movie like this, you have a greater appreciation for how much Peter Jackson is able to cram into each of his movies without losing any vital plot nuances, but without feeling rushed (of course his usually last three hours).  Overall, I'd have to say that &#34;Jack&#34; is a pretty good way to slay a couple of hours.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|THey have guns and a drunken theme thruought the movie. It needs a storyline for younger viewers but otherwise very good graphics and story to keep you watching.
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|Most of the music I listen to is dark and moody or prog rock (Type O Negative, Tool, Porcupine Tree, etc.). Walk of the Earth is more upbeat and fun and always brings a smile to my face. This is the perfect summer music.
B001H1SVO8|2.0|It's a piece of art, very well done for what it set out to do. It has a lot of good messages about what life is and how it needs to change. However, the destructive nature of the film that never redeems itself/finds any redemption made me not particularly like this movie. It makes you think which is good. I actually watched it for a class at Seminary. We looked at religious themes in the movie. The debasement of the flesh, which many Saints throughout the century took on as a way to get to the spiritual is a theme in the movie. Of course we know this is too destructive.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this. I just wish there were more levels. Can't wait for them to come out with more. I would even pay to play this game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I higly recommend to anyone who needs to know why what is, is, and to know the truth that will set free and free indeed
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|not a bad game for a blatant ripoff of another popular game. the swipe movement isnt always that responsive though. I'm on a note 2 and have never had a problem with any other apps that didn't respond to my touch before. 5 stars if the responsiveness is tweaked. Be prepared to wait for a while to play after the app first downloads as it goes through multiple download processes before you can finally play. I would recommend downloading on Wi-Fi if you ever worry about data overages.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love the suspense of this book. I cried at some parts. I can't believe I cried,funny. Great book Great
1600244602|4.0|This is the first time that I have listened to audio books by Baldacci and I enjoyed it very much.  There are three books in this series about the Camel Club and Stone Cold is the last so I would suggest reading the other two for continuity.  The titles can be found on Baldacci's web site.  This is an author that I will read in the future.The stories solve mysteries and right wrongs.  Even though there are several murders, the reading is not gruesome.  I would recommend this series to others.
B0070YDOT8|4.0|This is a good game. Could be better with themes and stuff. I like it great game if I say so myself
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I am a Grisham fan, but this was not his best work.  However, I look forward to the next Grisham novel.
B00884GR0W|3.0|pros.<br />1:it can be a rpg.<br />2:it has dragons.<br />cons.<br />1:it buggy.<br />2:its super slow.<br />3:when you spawn animals they sometimes get stuck in blocks.<br />just get minecraft its 10000000 times better!
B0045TYDNC|5.0|If you don't have a rear lens cover on your expensive Nikon lenses, you should buy this.  Protection of the glass in your lenses is just common sense (which sometimes seems pretty rare).
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Jobs was not a nice man. He was equal parts brilliant and cruel. At times I had to put the book away because the behaviors described were so odious. That said, the impact that this one man had on our society is staggering. This book is an unflinching and brilliant portrayal of Steve Jobs.
B00BG4UWPC|4.0|This is very upbeat, exciting, and has an 80s sound. I loved it immediately. There are lots of tempo changes and variety to the songs, and many of the songs give me goosebumps!
B0042H9YMC|5.0|Believe it or not, I had never seen this movie (lol).  My niece & nephews were AMAZED recently when this movie came up in conversation recently so, I promised them I would get a copy of this movie ASAP.  And, Amazon had it more reasonably priced than ANYONE - - THANKS so much!  I LOVED IT!!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|This is the first full album I have purchased from JT, and I love it. It is ethereal at times, soothing to the ears, and just an all-around beautiful album. It is meant to be listened to all the way through. It reminds me of Kanye's 808 Heartbreak album, which I also love - not in the sound, but in the whole album experience.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game. my husband was playing it for awhile on one of his devices and I finally downloaded it for myself. so fun creating your own city. I only wish that you didn't run out of energy so fast and easily and that it was easier to fill it back up.
B00B1DC2FQ|4.0|Purchased for my 4yr son who is spends most of his time pretending to be a dinosaur or playing with his collection. The figure is exactly as I would have expected coming from Schleich.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is one of the most-read books on our shelves. I prefer my kids reading a classic as such rather than the new stories that aren't written well. Directing our children to books like teaches our children.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|I have an Xperia ion, which is a pretty good phone, and this game freezes constantly. It's fun, but it's not worth ten dollars
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|I like this game, I wish it wasn't broken.  For the free app of the day, I was entertained.  Probably worth $1.00.<br />If it wasn't broken.
B0063GORYU|2.0|Every time you start a new game you get ads.  Very annoying.  Saving the $0.99 is not worth the annoyance.  The game works well otherwise.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I've said it before and I'll say it again, Nalini Singh cannot go wrong at the moment, every one of her books is amazing in and of itself and Heart of Obsidian did not disappoint. It took me a lot longer to read this book just because so many things came together and were explained from previous books in the series that I wanted to take it all in. A fantastic installment and hopefully not the last!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is an  awesome app.  I was looking for a diary app,but here I found much more. This an app capable of creating multiple books, for instance I have a  book for my diary, one for my day to day.errands,still another I use for notes I write when doing research online.  There is no limit to what you can do with this app
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Lots of today items in an old type of movie. It was full of action for sure. But it didn't knock my socks off. Maybe I am to old for this kind of movie. 46.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|For me at least the game has been down and will not let me play. I only played this game only a day. I think the creators NEED to fix this problem. NOW MEANING NOW. And not latter. I want to play the game NOW. But other than that I LOVE this game. I like how cute the minions are. But please fix this game ASAP. Mostly so I can play this game. If you haven't played this game it is an awesome game. If you die you can see what you did wrong and what you need to do different next time. And you can also buy extremely cute costumes. It is the best game I have.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|A zombie twist on a love story. I liked the final scenes. It ended good. Just a smidge of horror but not bad.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this movie. I loved every minute of it, and it kept me on my toes the entire time. Ben Affleck was amazing. So was everyone else in the movie. I loved that Rory Cochrane was in this movie to. He's my favorite actor. I also love that it was a UV Digital copy now I have it on my iPad and can take it with me wherever I go!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This is a lovely book, written so well. I loved it. It was really sad, but well worth it, and a great read. I recommend this to anybody.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my favorite game and its the most realistic horse game I have!  I recommend it to anyone who loves horses
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this...have gotten so many great ideas for my classroom, my home, and just everyday happenings. Start Pinning today and you'll never stop!
145210655X|5.0|This book is brilliant!  Our whole family loves it.  You don't even have to be a star wars fan to enjoy the humor in it.  The length, the colors, the drawings, the jokes are all perfect!!!  Perfect buy for anyone who loves books, illustrations! Thank you Jeffrey Brown!  The humor is spot on!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever worth every dollar I played it on xbox edition now I can play in the car and it is awesome
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Disney is doing a great job of entertaining the entire family.  I really love how this movie has a really good story.  There is good singing (but not cheesy), adventure, exciting, and love.  I really enjoyed it as much as the kids did!  They laughed a lot too!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|omg this game is fun its like subway surfers and temple run my little sister loves it and so do I good game
0307352153|5.0|I originally got this book from my local library. I loved it so much that I had to get my own hard copy. As an introvert and a public school teacher, I found this book extremely beneficial on both personal and professional levels. The seller was very efficient and easy to work with. I had my book in only two days! Thanks for your business.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|Set up a VSphere 5.1 lab with the 2 boxes. Everything is working great!<br />Setup was easy. I recommend this product!
B00AH69MS8|4.0|I have an OCD when it comes to all the properties set on a song.mp3 file and they have to be correct. Well... The genre for Master of Puppets was set to rock (hahaha -- maybe it was intentional considering Metallica's place in music right now? :) ). Besides this, a must buy for any thrash metal fans that have appreciated Metallica in the past (even the slightest).
B00AEFXVW0|2.0|It was to see the well publicized naked breasts shot of Michelle Trachtenberg.  It has been cut out.  The rest of the film sucks.  How long to I have to wait to see her lovely boobies?
B003K16P3M|5.0|Graceling has much of what I look for in a fantastic story: a strong lead, an equally strong supporting cast, action, love interests, good writing, and settings I can visualize.<br /><br />Katsa, the main character, is wonderfully complex. She is both strong-willed and physically strong, strong enough to kill with her bare hands. It's what she's graced with, there are others graced with special abilities but they aren't all the same; some are mind readers, others predict weather. She knows what she can do, but that doesn't mean she isn't struggling to find herself. Is her grace all she is?<br /><br />Graceling is rounded out with an assortment of but believable cast of characters ranging from best friends, love interests, and those who would like to use Katsa for their own gain.  My favorites, aside from Katsa are Raffin and Po.<br /><br />The book takes place across a variety of interesting settings. The settings enhanced the mood of different events and were well described, to the extent where in addition to seeing these places, you could almost feel the cold, the wet, or the wind blowing across the grass.<br /><br />I found it easy to lose myself in the story thanks to its engaging and well-paced plot along with its strong writing. I look forward to the next two books, Fire and Bitterblue.<br /><br />*Review abridged from my book review blog*
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried several keyboards but this is by far the best. I like the size and layout and the number pad. Of course the best feature is its ability to anticipate what you are typing and not only suggest the current word but also the most likely words to follow.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Concerned about loss of google reader. Happy with Feedly which is a change for the better. Only regret is it difont happen sooner. Got app from Amazon for kindle fire hd.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|it was too chopped up, and would have been better using chronological order<br />that's my opinion<br />however, I love that the focus was the reincarnation focus<br />the actors were phenomenal
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|This game is awesome can't stop playing it. Love e it so much. Game is amazing.... Love it love it love it
B002PYW26Y|5.0|this movie was a first movie shared with a life partner<br />and since we were soul mates it felt like we were lost in space too
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book is a must read! It's a romantic, funny, & a sweet story. If you like love story's this is the book 4 you!
B0064J6OMO|3.0|from a nanny point of view, too  much<br />from a woman's point of view, too crude<br />from a humanity point of view.....too many indignities
0425252868|5.0|This book is one of the best I've ever read.  The author spent years doing research.  You see WWII from both the German and U.S. perspective and any decisions you might make are based on a very real and personal account of these two hero's.
B004GYY714|5.0|When my sister was in the hospital in ICU we wanted her to listen to music. We found Tunein on the Kindle . It came in clear and we witnessed a miracle. At the same time that she passed I'll Fly away came on which was the song she sang to our mother at her passing . My daughter and I had both said we would not be singing it to her because we don't sing well. You guessed it we all stood around her bed singing it. She must have been smiling.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|I had trouble putting this book down. I lost some sleep over it, but it was well worth it! No one who loves fantasy should  be disappointed.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Fun! Not too easy and keeps you thinking. If you love room escape games, this one is a must. Lost City by Fire Maple Games is another great game.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2HVRGB1I0S0NT]]This is an excellent purchase for the money.  The audio difference is night and day.  I highly recommend this microphone to anybody who needs better audio for their videos.<br /><br />NOTE:  Since this mic is mono, you will need to buy a mono to stereo 3.5 adapter.  I purchased mine at Radio Shack for a little more than $3.00
0670026557|3.0|OK business read.  Lots of supporting research provided which is good.  But the idea of giving to others as both helful and detrimental to careers is confusing.  Not as useful as other tried and true business books, such as Peter Drucker, who esentially says be a giver - outcomes and relationships!
B008220BLG|5.0|A twist on Shakespeare's &#34;Romeo and Juliet,&#34; this movie is sharp, funny, and touching. I loved the dry humor and play out of the story.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|3 different guitarists from 3 different eras all bonding over their love of a particular instrument, it was great fun to watch. The only real downside is that I would have liked longer uncut sections of them sitting around and talking with each other, the parts shown were very interesting but left me wanting even more
B00881PPTO|4.0|Its well designed, and can easily be understood even if you are not used to using travel apps! I would buy it again!
B007EECSFA|4.0|I was surprised with the twist. The characters were well developed. I loved Dorothy and didn't want her to be deceitful in her actions that resulted in her \\"second chance.\\" Laurel was a determined investigator. The thoughtfulness kept me interested in wanting to find out what happened. I would definitely recommend this book.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|All of my grandchildren of different ages love this tale.  It is so beautifully told with such lovable characters......the message of environmental care and the byproducts of greed are so applicable to today's society.  I can't say one negative word about this video......everybody can benefit by this animated classic.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|It lived up to my expectations. There were a few things that i had not anticipated, but I had heard rumors about them before I read the book. You clearly get the feeling that it is the end of the books, by all the loose ends Charlaine ties in this one, like all the &#34;guest&#34; appearances.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This movie was  so funny and the music ... well it just redid my whole existence. I did not think I would like it but now.  I am in love. If you need to perk up or just feel good about being stuck here (on earth) .. . watch the movie listen to the soundtrack and you will be a new entity. I love classical music however I will never stop listening to this cd because it is so upbeat and happy. LA BEAUTIFUL BLEND OF VOICES... and the story was great too.
B00846REIS|4.0|I really liked this book though it had a lot of similarities to Fifty Shades of Grey. There isn't much of a plot. But who doesn't love a good romantic, erotica novel!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is a great short novel. You immediately identify with the main character, there's lots of action and adventure. I keep thinking of it as a graphic novel in my head for some reason as its written so beautifully.  You'll love this!
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|same as seen on net, very good quality, very good movie and totally revamped idea and stroy, figure will remind of this all the time
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|gemma arterton is fun to look at, leather pants! - jeremy renner is okay.  but overall its just  a C+/B- movie  reasonably entertaining
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|Challenging. Addicting. Sometimes seemingly impossible to advance. Hard not to buy more moves at times out of frustration but try not too.
B00821OX98|1.0|Thought I would like it but I hate it. Aliens look too fake. It does not compare to &#34;The Walking d=Dead.&#34;  I got Amazon Prime because of &#34;Falling Skies.&#34; My friend recommended this series and I don't like it. Eh.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Captivating!  Literally could not put this book down!  Held you through every twist and turn and left you wondering still the same.
B000E1155E|3.0|I really don't see where the arctic monkeys hype comes from. His voice is so damn annoying. The songs are all the same
B003VANOFY|5.0|Can't play games without it. Sounds fantastic. A little pricey but well worth the money. Battery really does last as long as they state.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|can't wait for the next book in this series to come out! each story is better than the last one
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I bought this movie for myself. I had bought for my granddaughter before and they kept telling me about it and that I should see it so I bought one for me. I love it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Fables are always a little difficult but always leave you wanting more. At the end of this story I had so many questions that, I guess, are mine to answer. And that's the fun of it.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This is a good show with the imagination of JJ Abrams  Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci and crew I like it A++
B00AB7HESI|5.0|So much fun to play literally create anything so fun create: giant flying rainbow beaver so much FUN FUN FUN :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is just like minecraft only it could use a huge boost to beta or via witch ever one it is
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved it and recommend it. We all need some comedy in our lives.<br />I can hardly wait to see # 2
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Just the visual alone is a feast for the eyes. Cinematography is phenomenal. Story is fascinating, but takes an abrupt turn towards the end. Took me awhile to fully understand what the storyteller was trying to convey. It's a bit philosophical. Because of the Indian accent, one has to pay attention to the conversation to catch what they're saying. But overall, a extraordinary feat to bring this story to life in a poetic way which the director, Ang Lee, accomplished.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I liked the game. But if I have to start over every time there is an update the u can keep your game. What a load of<br />crap.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Kept the original characters and personalities intact, which is a big plus. Good story about the beginning of all the Star Trek characters coming together. Great adventure.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I absolutely loved this book. I had no idea where it was going to go, and some of the twists really threw me, but they were great. It's a very interesting version of the classic time-travel story, and hints just enough on what the consequences might be. Definitely recommend.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Fascinating to watch how they came about the location of Osama Bin Laden. Torture scene and raid is bit violent, but half expected. Love Jessica Chastain; she did phenomenal.
159463176X|1.0|It started good then as I read on, the story kept on jumping from one to another and did not establish anything for me.  This was not as good as his two books.
B00BESM14U|4.0|This film surprised me - very well executed and interesting storyline. Subject matter is serious and more for adults than for kids. This is not a comedy. I love how the story unfolds about what's triggering a young teen's blackouts and suicidal tendencies. We journey with him to discover it. Even he doesn't know until the later part of the film. If you're uncomfortable about this subject, teen sexuality and homosexuality, then see another film. But if you are intrigued by what makes people tick and not offended by these subject matter, then this is a very good film.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This story has me awake at night going over all of the people and their stories.  The characters are wonderful and it flows along so well.  I was deeply shocked when one of the main characters died.  I would have liked the person to have lived.
0307730700|5.0|I &#34;met&#34; Eric while watching Molly the Owl and thought so this book should. E good when I checked it out of the library to listen to on audiobooks.<br />It knocked my socks off and the message is so powerful. I have recommended it, gifted it and the two purchases are for holiday gifts for friends.<br />Truly one of the BEST books and stories I have ever read.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Another wonderful story by the great Neil Gaiman. Loved the characters, the pace, and the tone! Fans of his other works will not be disappointed.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|Plays the music or videos i am looking for. Dont like the adds but ohh well will still use the app.
B009AMAGXK|4.0|I am unfamiliar with the books, but the trailer intrigued me. I watched it with some hesitation that it would be another poorly constructed teen fantasy (aka Twilight), but I really enjoyed this movie! I can't put my finger on what I liked about it, though. The cast boasted some stellar names who all did admirable jobs in their roles, and the young actor who played Ethan was incredibly natural and likeable. The story was also unlike any I've encountered thus far and was delivered with ease. There was nothing about the movie that left a big impression (not one performance that knocked my socks off, or a twist in the story that caught me off guard), so I can't pinpoint any one thing that would make me recommend it to someone else...BUT, it is flat-out entertaining and kept me very interested. This felt more like a vehicle to tell a fairy tale than to beat down special effects or overdo emotional scenes, which was refreshing. I'd recommend it, and say decide for yourself!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A Feast for Crows takes a slower pace than its predecessor Storm of Swords, but once it hits its groove it is just as good. This book doesn't feature the series' most popular characters, but the stories being told are just as intriguing and there are just as many turns and twists.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Pros: great game, no bugs, cool graphics, awesome mini games (fluffy unicorn is my favorite),, nice handling. Cons: this game wasn't made a year ago.
0764137433|5.0|I have always wanted to include this fascinating book in my library -- thanks so much for allowing me to do so!!!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The story rambled and left you hanging at the end.  I think the author got burned out with the story and just wanted to end it.
0061714372|4.0|Dave Mustaine's autobiography takes you inside the mind of the frontman from Megadeth, the legendary thrash/speed metal that has spawned amazing albums such as &#34;Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?&#34;, &#34;Rust In Peace&#34; and &#34;Youthanasia&#34;, and has cemented its status as one of the most talented and successful acts in the rock universe. It's an honest, insightful look to the life and misadventures of a former junkie and angry man who proved to the world of what he was capable of doing whenever he grabbed a mic and an electric guitar anytime, anywhere. This is an essential purchase for any rock fan, old or young. Believe me, you'll learn a lot about the man himself, and you will admire him for how candid, humble, funny and straightforward he can be.

044024613X|5.0|This book held my attention,  I felt I learned much about the court system<br />and importance of the jury selection.  The author was very skillful and wove<br />a fascinating tale.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A song of ice and fire books got me excited about reading again. Originally I sought these out to find out what may happen on the television series Game of Thrones and couldn't stop at the first, second, or third book. I read all the way to the end of the fifth book and now I search every day when the sixth book will be published. I wish I had bought all five books at once to save some money though. Less than a quarter way through Game of Thrones I knew I had to read all of the books. The show is good on its own, but when you read the books you find out they make some changes, probably due to time, cast, and budget constraints. Martin's mind was not limited by these factors, which makes the series of novels at least 5 times more entertaining than the show.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|If it's not broken don't change it. New format is awful. Forget the stupid graphics...give me the info. Ready to dump it for something better. Bring back the old format.
B00571F26Y|4.0|My acid reflux was becomming unmanagable.  Stopped eating wheat two weeks ago.  Symptoms went away in two days.  Haven't taken Rx nor any other antiacids since.  Also lost 10 lbs.<br /><br />Book is very good.  Didn't give 5 stars becuase I felt fist half was too detailed.
B000NA22C6|1.0|I'm not even going to buy this blu-ray version...It's absurd, there are subtitles for languages like Danish, Icelandic and Czech...languages that are spoken by no more than 15 million people each one. For God's sake! Icelandic is spoken by less than 500,000 people, and this version doesn't have subtitles for Spanish; a language spoken by more than 500 million people on the planet, it's the second language in the world by number of speakers. Let's be clear, I don't have anything against the other languages, but it's a terrible misleading that this version cannot be seen and understood by so many people; Spain, Latin America and some countries in Africa and South East Asia.<br />You know? In these parts of the world we also watch movies, and have an appreciation for cinema.<br /><br />I have the advantage of speaking English, but many of my co-speakers don't.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this show and can't wait for season 4.  If you haven't watched all of season 3 yet don't do any googling because you won't wont to know any spoilers.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game has great graphics. It takes a little while to load, but is fun and challenging. Still working on the first level. :p
B008JFUPOY|4.0|All 3 of my kids (7 year old boy/girl twins and an eight year old) really enjoyed this movie, and my husband and I were mostly entertained too (always a plus in kids' movies.) This is basically a 'prequel' to Monsters inc. - Sulley, Mike, and Randy are all at Monsters University in the 'Scare' program, hoping to qualify to eventually work at Monsters Inc. as scarers. Sulley and Mike can't stand each other on first sight, and because of their rivalry end up both being eliminated from the program. They have to team up for a chance to get back in, and learn all sorts of lessons about teamwork etc. along the way.<br /><br />Most kids won't get the college jokes but that's OK because there's enough going on to keep them entertained, and the college jokes are meant to engage the adults accompanying them. The animation, performances and pacing are all as good as the first film. I do feel that the scare scenes in this one are a bit scarier than in the first film, and that without little 'Boo' (the very young child trapped in the Monster world in Monsters Inc.) this isn't quite as charming a film, and also not as suitable for the very young (ages 2-4 may be frightened, it will depend on the child.) I also think that as a prequel/sequel it didn't show any spectacular originality that would have lifted it to 5 stars in my opinion. So it's a solid, 4-star, entertaining family film in my book - not a classic.
B003NX76BM|4.0|This was a book I hated to put down! Great job again Nora keep it up ! I know you will indeed.

068485743X|5.0|This book, I believe, though I haven't been put in the rejection pile yet, does what it says in the title. This book made a dramatic difference in my first pages. Now, I'm waiting to hear if an agent will publish my first book.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Game freezes sometimes but is still totally fun. I love playing this game. It's fun catching the animals. I give it a 5 star but the game freezes needs to be fixed asap.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is truly amazing. I love every part of the story. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend.
1781162646|4.0|Stephen King hasn't done it for me lately. I haven't quite enjoyed his newer stuff as much as his older but Joyland is a return to the old King I loved. Character building, mundane places, a creepy atmosphere, and a dark and evil bad guy who you want to see get his come-uppance. It's an entertaining ride for sure, one that I'd suggest anyone to take. Not only does it have compelling characters, but it is one of the more human books King has written in a long time where you feel bad for the characters and you grow to love them, even if it is a smaller book.<br /><br />A fine piece of literature. While not King's best, it is a return to why I love King.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie even more after viewing &#34;Thor.&#34; Without that basis, I was confused as to the characters, the interactions, and the major theme. I always enjoy Robert Downey Jr. in any movie, but his Tony Stark character is witty; must listen carefully to his interactions with others.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|First, let me just say, I love the subtitle. I tend to be fond of subtitles, but A Game of Shadows is a great title or subtitle. I wish I'd thought of it.<br /><br />Second, I'm a big fan of Sherlock Holmes. I've read (and own) all of the Holmes stories, so, when I say I like Holmes, it's not just some vague notion of Holmes formed when I was a kid from watching movies and television shows about Sherlock.<br /><br />Having said that, Guy Ritchie has done an excellent job of adapting the stories into movie format. There have, of course, been some changes (like with Sherlock's fastidiousness), but, overall, he kept all the fundamentals of Holmes and has made a faithful adaptation rather than just making some detective story and calling the character Sherlock as in many of the previous incarnations of Holmes.<br /><br />Of course, the acting by Robert Downey, Jr. is superb. Looking at these movies through a James Bond lens, I would say that Downey is the Sean Connery of Sherlock Holmes. He's more rugged and less refined. More of a brawler than a fencer, which, actually, also holds true to the character; although, I'd be interested in seeing someone do a Roger Moore version who is more of the gentleman and fencer. This also falls within the realm of Holmes. Okay, so, maybe Pierce Brosnan for those of you out there hating on Roger (but I grew up with Moore Bond films, and I love them most). However, I can't actually think of anyone that would be better at Holmes than Downey has been.<br /><br />Add Jude Law to that, and you have a pretty perfect team. I'm not a huge Jude Law fan. Not that I dislike him, but I think he often comes off the same from movie to movie. However, I think he's been the perfect pairing for Downey in these movies. Their combination is... well, they make an excellent team.<br /><br />I've heard a lot of mutterings about how this one wasn't as good as the first, but I don't know that I can agree with that. Sure, they've removed the romantic element (and I was sorry to see Rachel McAdams go), but, really, the romantic element is not exactly appropriate as an ongoing thing in Sherlock Holmes. In almost all ways, Holmes is above romance. Adler was the only woman Holmes was ever interested in even remotely and that was because she bested him. They do add the tension of Watson's wife to the mix, and I think that serves adequately as a substitute for any romance for Holmes. His romance is with \\"the game.\\"<br /><br />Jared Harris was an excellent choice for Moriarty. He's not someone I would have thought of, but he was great. Quiet and under spoken, rather like a spider. He was quite chilling.<br /><br />If you saw the first Holmes with Downey and liked it, this one is definitely worth seeing. For those of you that haven't read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, be aware that many of the smaller details are actually from the stories and not just inventions for the movies. Those kinds of things being included made these movies a very enjoyable experience for me. If you haven't read Doyle, you should.<br /><br />But don't spend a lot of time looking for Moriarty. He's really only in two of the stories and was an invention by Doyle to provide an adequate nemesis for Holmes in order to kill him off. Which he did. And, then, brought him back later because of public demand. See that thing with bowing to public pressure in writing goes back a long way.
B00BIR381W|5.0|I have watched PLL since it's start. I can't get enough if it! It's definitely one of those series you have to watch from the beginning but I am truly hooked. Ever twist and turn gets better and better there are no events that make me think it's going way off course or weird or anything. It just gets more and more involved in the original plot. Much different than the books as well.
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|2010 was a great year for animated movies: Toy Story 3 (which made me cry), Despicable Me (which made my wife cry (which is not to say that TS3 didn't make her cry, but it's much more impressive to make me cry at a movie than her)), and Megamind. So, although we really loved Despicable Me when we saw, it still got overshadowed by the other two. Meaning we own the other two, but I never bought Despicable Me despite the incredible voice work by Steve Carell. I feel bad about that, now.<br /><br />Which may seem kind of silly, to feel bad about not buying a DVD, but, really, we all, the whole family, loved Despicable Me. When it came out. But, see, the news of Despicable Me 2 didn't really do that much for me. It was kind of a shrug and \\"oh, yeah, that's cool,\\" but I wasn't dying to go see it or anything. I'm sure that's because we haven't watched it again since 2010, and I'd forgotten how good it was. My daughter, however, was dying to go see it. I'm pretty sure she wants minions of her own.<br /><br />So we went to see Despicable Me 2, and I'm pretty sure it's the best movie I've seen all summer. Okay, second best. Star Trek beats it but not by much. At any rate, it was so much better than Monsters University, which is its actual competition. Not only was Despicable more funny than Monsters, but it had all of the heart and soul that Monsters was lacking. And it made my wife cry.<br /><br />I don't actually have anything negative to say about the movie. The closest thing to a negative is that the plot is almost conventional, but, see, it's only almost conventional. The fact that there is an attempt to recruit Gru to the AVL (Anti-Villain League) at the beginning of the movie, because of his expertise as a former villain, puts things just off-kilter enough that you don't really know which direction the movie is going. And I won't tell you which, because that would just spoil it.<br /><br />And, I have to say, that scene where Gru is on the phone with the people who failed to send the Fairy Godmother to his adopted daughter's birthday party... well, that was classic. As a father, I've made those calls, and they had that bit down perfectly. All the way to the hanging up and... well, that, also, would be telling. But there are so many of  those moments incorporated into the movie that it made it great for kids and adults.<br /><br />The animation was terrific. The voice work from the actors was excellent. The minions were funnier then ever.<br /><br />Wait, now that I think about it, there is one issue with the movie. The title. Because Gru isn't so despicable anymore. I can't wait for a third one, and I'm gonna go have to make sure I pick up both of these movies, now. It's great stuff.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|There's nothing to compare with this series. Entertainment with a heart and soul, including political, historical, ethical and moral messages masterfully written into the script and complete with outstanding visual accuracy and thoroughly convincing character portrayals. Its moral messages are the same relevant ones we wrestle with, and always with the reminder for the viewers to turn away from hate and violence, to consider other viewpoints, and to make humane and moral life decisions.<br />Families with children of all ages will enjoy the story lines and the action, and parents will be able to relate to the love and warmth of the plots as well. With six seasons to view there will always be these gems to turn to.<br />I am so glad I have this series to turn to at the times there is no quality programming scheduled.
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|The movie was really funny and sweet and the acting was very good.  Barbra Streisand was great! Ignore the bad reviews!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I'm fascinated by this show. I like Josh Charles' acting tremendously and I have always liked Juliana Margulies since ER.
B0082Z1CVQ|3.0|I liked the book in a way,you would like a acquaintance. You want to talk or in my case read it. But at the same time it doesn't really matter too you if you talk to the person or read the book. At some parts I loved the book but sometimes I had a hard time getting through the chapters. Over all I guess I liked and disliked the book.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Gritty, fast paced action with disturbing plot and characterization. Addicting and satisfying, a roller coaster ride that never ends. Just doesn't get much better than this.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett has once again written a gripping story of people's lives in Europe and the U.S. pre and during WWII.  It is more fact than fiction and brings to light many of the truths that we never knew and how it changed peoples' lives forever.  The characters are very real and believable.  Every person will be able to relate to the story.  It resonates with every possible emotion and it doesn't matter what your ancestry is, you will feel many of the things as you read.  I would recommend this book to anyone who cares about the world and its people.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|This was a great idea for a movie, my wife and I really enjoyed it. Good story line and kept your attention very easily

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I saw this movie out of curiosity because I thought the trailers for the second movie looked very amusing. I was pleasantly surprised with how funny it was. The minions are the best thing about Despicable Me in my opinion. I would definitely recommend renting it first if your on the fence about it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The only character in this book I feel is believable is Taylor, the all around guy.  Gray is a self made billionaire and Ana is a virgin but seems to be able to give a perfect BJ.  I remember reading stories like this one in playboy 20 years ago but for whatever reason woman seem to love this one.  I don't get it.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A beautiful, life-affirming book. I plan to read it again. It is the kind of book you want to read slowly, because it has a very gentle and mesmerizing tone to it.  You also don't want it to finish because you don't want to say good-bye to Harold Fry.
B009R659L8|4.0|I enjoyed the story.  It was intriguing.  Easy to read & pick up again.  But the story did unravel too quickly in the last chapter or two.
B008XX6J4C|3.0|Watching the PBS show gives you breaks that you don't get when listening to the CD. It becomes overwhelming with steady push to sound different. In small doses, it works but not song after song as you would listen to a CD. There are more cuts I would delete than keep and that's not a good thing.
B001RLP862|5.0|These cards are great, and the box to go with is perfect. The cards just fit, without much wiggle room to slide around. The cards have a great feel to them, but can slip a bit when they're new.
076790382X|3.0|Is there such a thing as a Bill Bryson book that isn't entertaining?  This one is a collection of newspaper columns written for a British newspaper once Bryson returned home to the U.S.  The book was published in 2000, and the columns were published prior to that, so a few of them now read as dated (like a few comments about the state of pre-9/11 air travel). But not as many as you might think. There was only one that I didn't care for, and it was an entire fake tax return. It may have been funny in print, but it didn't translate well over audio. I wouldn't consider this book to be as educational as some of his other efforts, but it was a fun listen.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|The tale of Abdhulla and Pari and all the people involved in their lives might be too sentimental to qualify as a true  drama, but even though the story is sweet and tender, it sweeps the reader along like an old fashioned epic.<br />Khaled Hosseini is a skilled writer who obviously likes to tell you a story. His enjoyment shows through in every portrait in the story.<br />Read, it, and share his joy.

1442359919|4.0|*Actual rating is 3.5 stars.<br /><br />I have been a Stephen King fan for as long as I can remember and have read so many of his books and loved them. This book, though not as much of a thriller as I expected it to be, was fantastic! As the synopsis says, it was beautiful and heartbreaking. I loved learning Devin's story and listening to it all unfold. There are many side characters that play very important roles in his life. For once, I didn't figure out who the killer was until almost right before it's revealed and that's saying a lot for me. This isn't one of my favorites of his, but I did still really enjoy it.<br /><br />Normally this would be the part of the review where I talk about the main character, but since Devin is telling his story to us, I don't really know how to explain him. We basically are going along with him as he grows up, deals with love, loss, and heartbreak. Along with that we have a murder mystery, but though it really brings the story to where it's going, it's more in the background then you would think. I guess that Devin is the type of person I would be friends with. He cares about people in such a beautiful way, and even though he has suffered hurt and heartbreak, he is still a great person, and willing to extend his heart out to people again and again.<br /><br />There are a lot of secondary characters that I really grew to like. Annie and Mike being the ones that I liked most and had such an important part in this story. I also really loved Erin and Tom, Madam Fortuna, and in a weird way, Wendy. Wendy being Mike's first love who broke his heart. Mike was definitely my favorite though, and he worked his way into my heart the same way that he did to Devin. He really made the story for me and even managed to pull some emotion out of me.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version of this and I have to say that it was a great choice. The narrator was great at the different voices in a large cast of characters. I always knew who was supposed to be talking when. I thought he was also the perfect voice for Devin. I really felt as if he was telling me his story, not like someone was narrating it for him. I don't know if that makes sense, but I know what I mean. I could imagine sitting there having coffee and chatting with Devin as if he were a real person telling his story. It was easy to get wrapped up in the story and not want to stop.<br /><br />I loved that a lot of this story took part in an amusement park. It was fun to imagine the scenery and the things going on. Even though the story is centered around Joyland, I really more see it as a branch of the story. Mostly, I think it was about the beauty in love, life, and even death. I loved the friendships Devin formed. I loved the broken person he started as, and who he became. He was a strong person even if he didn't realize it himself. This wasn't really creepy or even that much of a thriller. It was just a beautifully told story with some tragic events. I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />* A copy of this audiobook was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. I did not receive any compensation.ed to be talking when.

0375831002|4.0|Throughout this book, the one telling the story is Death.  I wasn't sure I was going to like that, but I did. The perspective of this little girl and the others around her was a new thing, to me.  The way they lived, and suffered and the sacrifice the family made to help a Jewish man by hiding him was very impressive to me.  Expect a few tears.
B00BPA2PDY|4.0|Aside from foul language at times, it was great acting and story. New 4k was worth it. Not sure why Sony picked some of the new (old) 4K selections. Hope more 4k blueray's are coming.

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I have been playing this game for a few weeks already and love it. Very easy to operate. My only suggestion would be to change the position of the bar containing the home icon from bottom to top as your finger taps it very easily during a game interrupting it. Other than that I consider this as a great example of what good application should be like.
B0083V2VW8|5.0|If you're into scooters, mods, the 60's or any combination this is worth a look. The soundtrack is amazing! If you're a fan of The Who and haven't seen this movie yet, I favor Quadrophenia over Tommy. I love period pieces, especially set in the 60's and 70's. This movie follows Jimmy a Mod in swinging 60's London. Much of the movie builds towards the big scooter rally in Brighton, England where previous rallies gained fame and notoriety, depending on if you were a Mod, Rocker or bystander. Typical of the youth, clashes between two subcultures - Mods vs Rockers, propels key parts of the movie. Intertwined is the story of Jimmy trying to find himself throughout the movie, what it is to be a Mod and how to conform to society while still staying true to being a Mod. This pretty much is self introspection that most people can relate to regardless of their age. If you're not accustomed to the accents you might need to watch the movie a second time to catch some slang and things that can pass right by you, if not sub-titles work just fine. A triumph by The Who, as it shows what it was to be a Mod in England in the 60's. Great story, beautiful music and a peek into the minds of The Who.
B003YK42M0|4.0|I’m almost 3 years late to the “Come Around Sundown” party, but the record has been on my turntable for weeks now. Admittedly I didn’t buy the album when it first came out because of the first single “Radioactive”, which I still hate. However, I’ve finally gotten to a place where I can stand to listen to it and I’m thankful for that because the rest of the album is GREAT. The vocals/lyrics are top notch and the music is classic KOL, melancholy and addictive. Jared Followill is still, in my opinion, the band’s underappreciated secret weapon. He’s not a virtuoso bassisit by any means but his bass lines are perfectly suited to each song and that beats playing a thousand notes any day of the week. Great album. Great band.<br /><br />Album highlights: The End, Pyro, Back Down South, Pony Up, Pickup Truck
B009IQG5LK|5.0|Dick Tracy is a great family movie for all ages. If you're a fan of the old Dick Tracy comics this should be right up your alley. If you're new to Dick Tracy it's more of an alternate setting in the 40's. The cast of villains are unique and equally share billing in the movie with Dick Tracy himself. The movie shines on Blu-Ray and everything seems to jump with brilliance even more than what I remember when I first watched it in the theaters. The primary colors throughout the movie really make it seem surreal at times with a bit of opulence. This is one of my favorite movies for so many different reasons that set it apart from so many other movies.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|What can one say other than its fun on occasion between reading five or six books a week. However it is a simpleton exercise that really delivers nothing but momentary distraction.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|The movie does a good job of picking out some of the more important aspects of the book, but if read the book and then watch the movie it feels extremely rushed. You also would have no idea how close to death Katniss was in the arena from dehydration. Also, the ending is much better in the book. I enjoyed the movie, but it would have done the book a lot more justice had they broken it into two movies.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I have been doing the daily practice for more than a week now and I'm already happier, healthier, calmer and richer. I attribute my positive attitude and results to James' book.<br /><br />Read this book, improve your results at work and home.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was fun a bit short.  hope more rooms come out soon.  they rely on colors as the keys a little too much though.
B002FL3JA0|2.0|Compared to Hal Leonard's Ultimate Fake Book, which I own through my son David Dettlaff, who worked for Hal Leonard, there is no comparison.  I'll quit here....can't find a single favorable adjective for this product.  Gil Dettlaf
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Its a great game and I recommend that you at least try it but its only good for maybe two days. Then you cant open it. :/ I was really enjoying this game but now I'm very disappointed that I can no longer play it. :(
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is great except for the iap!! I want more diamonds without having to pay for them.<br />If it wasn't for that this game would be perfect!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Great product, probably enough in the tube to do 5 processor installs. Machine runs flawless now, no heat issues what so ever!
B004I744AS|5.0|It really is a big help! And I also like the little games and the daily facts. Very interesting and I am seriously addicted to it!
B007G51UV0|4.0|I am a very big ASUS fan!! I chose this as it has the built in Wi-Fi in an attempt to simplify my house and it worked out great after I worked out the quirks! I had one issue, I was getting a on/off issue and I checked power supply, RAM (i did have an issue with this after all but later found it to be in addition to....) and video. It seems that I needed to use another computer and flash the BIOS with the latest version in order for it to work with my equipment. After I updated the BIOS to ver 1806 I believe, then it was going great. Mind you I did this with the flashback option, and that is.. Download the file, renamed it to ASUS naming convention, the PDF can be downloaded through ASUS for proper naming due to it changing for every board type, and place file on usb stick on the root. Place USB drive in bottom USB port under LAN jack and apply power to board but don't turn the machine on!! Hold the BIOS_FLASHBK button on motherboard until the LED blinks and when it turns off its finished. This solved my issues, now it is running with no problems at all!!
0802473164|5.0|I'm 24 years old and I'm not married but dating someone. I found this book very helpful and a great read =D
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote is easy to use on the go! Way better than other note taker apps I've used. It's a must have! And you can't beat the price :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love  this game for my twin daughters because it's for all ages and it's a fun and all that
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Your interest will go out to young Theodore in his adventures.  Amazing his interest in the law and court procedures.<br />You will enjoy the book.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Solid, a good mix of mellow and up beat, uplifting and thought provoking. Can listen for message or just in the background. He's got it all covered.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Too much caramel and it loses its deliciousness, too little and you go wanting. I savoured this wonderfully imaginative story from the first bite to the last. How very playful and tragically romantic.
B001FB5634|2.0|This movie turned out to be actually too bleak, dreary, depressing.  It actually kinda does depict things as they would be-but so much so that it's hard to watch.  It's so bleak that you think, why am I watching this ?  So, I started fast forwarding through some chunks.  And the ending - won't give it away, but just adds to the unwatchable bleakness.  I'd never watch this again or recommend it unless you feel like making yourself depressed.  And why do 90% of the people in post-apocalyptic movies have to be cannibals ?
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|this app on my kindle fire says the version I have is to old and when I click update it sends me here and I try to update and all I get is you already own this app but it won't let my play. I'm very disappointed with this app.
159463176X|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this book is one I could not put down once I begun reading. It is full of episodes that help one understand the ethnic problems in the middle east. The wide separation of the haves and have nots. There is much time ahead in bringing the bitter past to modern times insofar as the treatment of women, the awful truths of war and man's inhumanity to man.  I found it sad and hopeful at the same time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The girl I babysit cannot stop playing this game. She never enjoyed horses until she began to play this game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|With out a doubt one of the slickest puzzles I ever played. Worth every penny. I am looking forward to the next one.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the sounds of nature so i got this app for relaxasion and its amazing it has more than nature also great sounds doing yoga relaxing trouble sleeping like noises get this this thing is apsalutly amazing
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I didn't think I would like this at first but once I got the hang of it I kept going until the last level and wished there was more.  I would definitely pay for this if they offered more levels.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|this application is awesome I was able to change my world, my stuff stack em, etc I just love it it's awesome
B00AK57N00|4.0|For such a simple game, I find this one oddly addictive.  Great option if you have a couple of minutes to kill.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot  of fun to play and  It is also very challenging .  Looking forward  to future additional levels of Escapes.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|It is an emotional book with great characters.  But the love Mia has for her family, friends and music is really heartfelt.  Can't wait to find out what happens in the next book.
1439102430|5.0|Tempe Brennan get into all types of trouble, and sniffs out the villain and solves the crime and puts the Perp away
B00821OX98|5.0|I could not stop watching! I watched the whole season in one day and can not wait for more. Good balance between character-building drama and action-packed suspense.
B008220D5K|2.0|While my husband and I are smack dab in the middle of the demographic this is aimed at, we both agreed after watching that we would never, ever, ever watch it again. Not because it wasn't funny. We actually laughed out loud quite a bit. But because we both so thoroughly despised nearly all of the people in it. I'm sure their flaws are meant to heighten the reality of it all, but that only convinced me these would never be people I would want to be friends with in real life. The tipping point really came at the Melissa McCarthy scenes. She just wants to find out why her son got yelled/cursed at by an adult who should really know better. She did nothing wrong. And yet, when it comes to the confrontation with the principal and both Mann and Rudd claim complete ignorance of the incredibly rotten behavior they exhibited, pushing McCarthy over the edge to look like the crazy one, I'm expected to side with them? Absolutely not. What they did was pretty despicable, not to mention uncalled for. Any smidgen of respect I might've had for either of them at that point was completely gone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|WONDERFUL ENTERTAINMENT RATED G FOR ALL AUDIENCES! THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL DEVELOPED, THERE ARE MANY TWISTS AND TURNS IN THE STORYLINE THAT ARE UNEXPECTED. JUST AN ENJOYABLE PROGRAM.
039472903X|5.0|same review as before- it is a gift to my grandson.  do you get it? get it? get it? no
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love games like this. Sometimes they challenge me a little more than I would like to admit. :-)<br />The puzzles you have to solve to escape the room are sometimes mind boggling, which is why I love it.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|This was a great read.  A most excellent book.Logan is back and as good as ever.  You should buy this book.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The app has been 'updated ' to be more complicated and to include obnoxious ads. Uninstalled. It was fine without the bells and whistles,  thank you very much.  sigh
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I thought this was really easy at first. In the later levels it's a real bear to complete! Very challenging ultimately.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game,  especially the feature where the minion responds to you tapping him. I like everything about. I think that Gameloft did good with this one. I recommend this to everyone who loves Despicable Me as much as I do!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I don't get the point. I am not stupid, but I couldn't even get to the first level. Very frustrating.
B00847KFDS|4.0|Nothing ground shaking here but this remains a sound recording<br />with some nice collaborations including a ripper version of Fortunate Son with the Foo Fighters.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Problem with resuming podcast from middle spot when resuming.  It also loosses precious spot on an unfinished listen.  All else works as expected Please fix.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|I rated this movie a 5. It was excellent. The actors were great. It was a very good story. I would recommend this to everyone.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved this book - my favorite so far! I can't wait for the 6th book.<br />It ties up so any loose ends and leaves you wanting more.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Recently started working exclusively on my iPad and these two little items work great. Take a picture with my camera and in just a sec I have them on the iPad. Would highly recommend them.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like this game it is fun but it needs to have a cowgirl in a skirt not cowgirl zombie and cowboy in pants
B007FTZDN8|5.0|You can't beat TED talks.  I have been watching this forever on the net and now it's on my kindle.  I love it.  Wish it had a little bit more browsing power like the internet version but it's still great.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Well, I finally got around to Old Man's War. As one comes to expect from Mr. Scalzi, the book contains an intriguing premise, crisp dialog and characters who could easily walk off the page and continue a conversation with you. As the beginning of the Old Man's War series, it lays down a nice foundation for the way the universe works, imaginative aliens and a plethora of problems to resolve. The action is solid but there's always something more, in this case, relationships. Like all good ScifFi, it makes us think about fundamental issues including age, maturity and identity. What is it that makes me me? Are we a Platonic soul stuffed into a physical creature for a time or do we have a more holistic mind/body blend that makes us who we are? What makes us an adult. How do we survive in a universe of aggressive species? When may we justly make war on others? These are some of the myriad of issues raised in Old Man's War.<br /><br />For full review: [...]
B0035LJZ1Q|3.0|While a good movie it is a remake of the previous movie and is just the same as the older version
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book and selected it because of the author's previous two best sellers. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; or other adventurous tales.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Comes with Blu-Ray and DVD in excellent condition.....and quickly! This is one of my favorite action movies....its well done and looks great on Blu-Ray.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|It was a good but not great book. Much of the book is a lot of set up and I cannot wait to read the next book as I read what the other characters are up to.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A great love story with enough mystery and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|kept taking me to home. don't waste your money.I wish it was better because I dealt was expecting way way more than I got . it took a long time to so download too.<br />STUPID
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is very good and I enjoy the different story lines and characters they introduce.  The relationships between the main characters are very complex .
B009NG1Q96|4.0|This book wasn't as good as the first one.  I kept waiting for her to make a decision.  I did enjoy it, and am looking to read the third series.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I read the first book and I am reading right now the second book.  The books are long, but I found myself always wanting to read more and go to the next chapter.  The writer is very skillful.  It includes enough descriptions of settings and characters without overwhelming the reader and the book has plenty of action.  There some parts that might not be acceptable for some people and maybe a little bit out of taste, but the story as a whole is amazing.  All the characters are very well developed.  At first, I thought that because the book was written from the point of view of multiple characters then several scenes will be repeated, but that is not the case.  The action keeps moving forward and I really like that I can see what happens through the eyes of different characters.  For example, the death of one character is narrated through the point of view of one character.  In the next chapter then the burial is narrated through the point of view of another character, but we don't see that character narrating again the death of that other character.  I like the language that is used, some of it from what most likely be medieval times, but the amount of language that is used is not too much and it is not confusing.  At the beginning of the book, it is kind of hard to keep track of all the characters, but as I kept reading I found that I had no problem remembering who was who.  I would recommend this kindle version.  By buying this bundle, I saved approximately $10.  The only thing that needs some improvement is the resolution of the maps.  I found myself sometimes having a hard time trying to read the map, but I don't know if the problem is the same with the print version.  All in all, I am really glad that I bought this kindle version.  And the next books, I will buy the kindle version too.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved this series.  As an American we often think of ourselves as the heroes.  It was lovely to read about all the efforts that all countries put forth to win WWII. I had no idea the power struggles of Germany, and surrounding  countries.  I loved the characters and how their lives developed from the story line of book 1.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|I purchased this item with high expectations but was really disappointed to find that it made the audio quality worse and providing no benefit whatsoever.  I read a bit about how common counterfeits are, checked the serial number on mine and FiiO reported it as unknown (in other words, counterfeit).  I went and purchased the same item from another site and sure enough, noticeable difference and no distortion/humming/buzzing.  I hope it helps someone else but I ordered mind from SMICORP and I would highly recommend they be avoided at all cost.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good book.  I read it for my senior year book report project and I found it to be a pretty interesting book in that it had so many twists and turns that keep you intrigued in the book and I ended up getting so attached to all of the characters.  Don't write this book off as boring or anything just because it was written a long time ago.  It is a classic for a reason and I would definitely recommend this book.  I read this book on my phone on a kindle app and that was really helpful to me because some of the words throughout the book I needed to look up the definition.  There is this one character Joseph who speaks in a sort of broken English based on his lack of education being a servant and because of this his few lines here and there are a little challenging and yet fun to decipher, but other than that the book is easy to read and understand.  It does take time to read this book (I think it took me an hour to read ten pages) but I wouldn't let that scare you away because it really is a great book and I don't regret reading it.  You don't realize how much time flies by while reading because you just wish you could keep reading more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game of problem solving. It's kind of makes me think of the game CLUE. I would recommend this game. I saw another version and will play it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|part fantasy, part child, part adult - just an all round fun, interesting, stimulating read - have also got his first book, but have yet to begin reading it
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Gaiman does such a fine job of expressing a child's perspective.  He did it in The Graveyard Book and he does it again in this newest novel!  The story moves along at a good pace, and I found myself much farther along than I thought I was when I was forced by real life to put the book down so I could take care of responsibilities.  If you like Gaiman, you'll like this one, too!
B001NKI60W|2.0|Meryl Streep bobbing around like a junior high girl with a cheshire cat grin has a sinister quality that poisons all of her scenes.  It's garishly obvious most of this was in a warehouse with giant green screens. I also disliked the intensely goofball style of most of the routines.  If the young actress who played the daughter sang every song in a more serious setting it could have been 5 stars.  She's a natural.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Its addictive. I keep wanting to go to the next level, even if I don't have the time to keep playing.
0763655465|5.0|This is a fun read for both toddlers and preschoolers. The love saying \\"Oh No, George\\" along with the book. But it also has a good underlying message to follow the rules and apologize when you make a mistake.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is the best time killer ever. it is so addicting its like one big magazine and there are so many great ideas!!!  LOVE THIS APP!

B000IDGDPA|1.0|This was one of the worst movies that I have every seen.  The plot was ridiculous and the acting terrible.
B00004CWTY|5.0|this was a great item to purchase and have, i can not get enough of this and  glad i bought it

B000WS4QJG|5.0|they look nice, have not used them as they were a gift. she likes them and uses them a lot.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|This is a very depressing and dark movie, yet it is compelling due to the unbelievable all star cast.  The sales &#34;motivation&#34; meeting by Alex Baldwin stands out as the most interesting sales meeting ever....I once showed a clip of it to my sales staff (after offering an opt out due to language).  Jack Lemmon was fantastic in this story.  Legendary acting skills.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|they look nice, have not used them as they were a gift. she likes them and uses them a lot.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Another sweeping novel that covers many continents, but which marries the various stories and themes seamlessly - definitely a MUST read!

B001F290E4|5.0|they look nice, have not used them as they were a gift. she likes them and uses them a lot.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My daughters didn't get a chance to see this movie in the theatres. So I bought it on a whim, since they so love the book!  Well, they love watching this so much that they must have seen it 10 times over just this week alone.  The songs are catchy and the story lesson is so important to us.  Yay for the LORAX!
B00005V9HH|5.0|they look nice, have not used them as they were a gift. she likes them and uses them a lot.
B008ENNXQI|4.0|The kids seemed to like it, and it had its funny moments, too!  Kind of fun to see Julia Roberts in that role as well
B0026772N8|4.0|Nice to re-read this book almost 35 years from first reading it. It's a classic that gets better with age.
B008220BLG|5.0|This is such a great movie! It's a zombie-comedy-romance, and as someone who just HATES chick flicks, this movie has just the right balance. This is the first DVD I've bought in a long time because I know I'll watch it more than once!
B004LROMWU|5.0|This is a great series for any sci-fi fans, I enjoyed it a great deal and the second season was even better.
B00BI745AA|3.0|Not bad, but the music deserved better voices. It was entertaining, but not as great as the stage production--for instance, if you've seen the 10th (NOT 25TH) anniversary TV show, the music of the movie disappoints.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|If you're looking for the basic story line with good-looking actors and actresses and great acting abilities, this is the movie for you. It has become one of my absolute favorites. But I realized after I read the book that there were certain scenes and lines missing. If you want a movie that follows almost perfectly, you should watch the 1995 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. This one had the beautiful music and scenes and was good at keeping your attention. and for that I love it. Keira Knightley, Matthew Macfadyen, Brenda Blethyn, Judi Dench, Donald Sutherland, Rosamund Pike, and Carrie Mulligan keep you laughing and awwwing from start to finish.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I'm not one of Dy-Lewis' big fans but this movie now has me looking for more of his work. Skilled performance, believable, intense and a period movie that fills the big screen. Emotionally moving.
B009K0OPQQ|5.0|My sister got me interested in this show back when it first started and I've been watching it ever since. But can you get any better than season 2? The answer is NO, YOU CAN'T! Season 1 was good at laying a foundation necessary for creating season 2. By the time you get to here in the series, you know the characters pretty well and feel ready to embark on new adventures and meet new people. The new people you will meet are Mulan, a brave and fierce warrior of a girl, Prince Phillip, a handsome, kind, and brave prince, Aurora, a slightly annoying and entitled princess that you grow to love, Andre the Giant, who isn't much of a giant now, Neil, who has a connection to Henry, Emma, Hook, and Rumpelstiltskin. and of course Captain Hook. Needless to say he's now my favorite character on this show. He's the kind of guy that you would love to hang out with but could stab you in the back the next minute (as the actor Colin O'donoghue has stated before). And He is the most attractive Captain Hook you will ever see.<br />There's always something new happening, especially now that the curse has broken in Storybrooke. New plots keep you on the edge of your seat and dying to know what happens next. Emma, along with her parents, Snow White and Prince Charming, try to hold the town together despite evil people like Cora, Regina, and Rumpelstiltskin. And the mysterious visitors from out of town.<br />The cast is great, the plots are great, the music is great, and the writers are geniuses. Don't waste another moment because you have to see this show. You'll be glad you did.
