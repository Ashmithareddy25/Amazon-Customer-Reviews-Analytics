B00AECGQF2|3.0|In Toca Hair Salon 2, you choose a character from 6 preset characters and do a variety of grooming options for each. You can do things like cutting, changing hair color, wash, rinse and blow out their hair(including facial hair). Once you've done that, you can comb and style their hair using several options of tools, from curling to straightening and the amount of pressure you place on the character determines their final look. Finish them off with a bow, hat or glasses and take a picture on a background you choose.<br /><br />This game has many fun aspects but honestly it gets old. A child might be more entertained for a longer period, but it only took a few days of playing small amounts of time for me(as a 30 year old) to be completely bored and ready to delete this from my Kindle.

I forgot how fun and addicting it could  be :) I definitely would recommend this game for everyone!!! The graphics are amazing and no lagging!!! A definite WIN!!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Very cool game, it took too long to download, but worth it &amp; u can't beat free! I would say get it,
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|I would have given the game 5 stars, but at $5, it's a little steep for this kind of game. G5 is NOT going the way of Big Fish in reducing their prices! That said, I enjoyed the game and the story. It's a good point &amp; click adventure game w/ no HO scenes - I like these games either way. Graphics were good but some of the mini-games were a bit hard! Good thing there's a skip option. I would have liked to have played some of the mini-games outside of the story when I finished the game, but there was no option for this, and I nearly reduced my rating to 3 stars because of it. The game was of good length and you have a choice of two endings. No glitches either! I would recommend this one if you don't mind the cost.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very entertaining!  Makes you think! Wish there were more levels and different challenges.  Like Myst games, but shorter and less levels.
B00FLDG5BE|4.0|Watched the concert in a movie theater earlier in the year with great audio and VIDEO. The blu-ray video quality is pretty bad start to finish. Not sure if this problem is an Amazon supply issue or is a Rhino problem. Once fixed, Amazon should mail out replacement dvd's by drones.<br />Performances are teriific, especially Greg Allman. Why prior Crossroad dvd's have superior video is a mystery. Hopefully the manufacturer will explain on this site.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The only downside to this game if that once you reach certain areas you have to pay too unlock them, but if you wait enough time and ask for help you will eventually get to go past. All in all even though the levels get harder and harder you still want to keep trying...... Awesome game guys!
B008JFUPK8|1.0|I am not usually critical of movies or TV shows. Some people don't understand what a movie is meant to be, and that is why they rate it badly. While I might not like a specific movie or genre, I understand that all movies have an emotional reaction that they try to elicit from the audience. Sometimes a movie is a parody, an action/drama, comedic in nature with some action, and my favorite of  all epic. That being said Superman is the worst movie I have viewed so far this year, (2013). There was no clear emotion that it elicited in me. The movie was hyped up so much that I figured it would have to be a little bit of a let down. Little did I know that it would be so much more then that.<br /><br />I enjoyed the beginning of the movie, but then after that it all went downhill. There was far to much CGI. This wouldn't be such a big deal if it looked good, but it didn't. Blockiness destroyed all the fast scenes and didn't even allow me to enjoy the classic imagery of superman flying. I don't mind the plot not being lock step with the previously published comics and movies, but don't change just for the sake of change. If your going to change make it better.<br /><br />The casting of the movie was generally good, except for Louis Lane. I don't know if it was Amy Adams or just the character she played, because she was the weakest link. I don't understand why the Kryptonians took her on to their vessel. They were going to use her to get Clark, but he turned himself in. So why did they need her? They obviously didn't, but someone needed to let Jor-El's program loose on the alien ship so it was forced like so many other parts of the script. Also some how and some way Louis always seemed to find Clark no matter where he was. Even after that huge battle between Clark and Zod that leveled the entire city, 10 seconds later she magically ran up out of nowhere. The emotional scenes all seemed forced and contrived from Clark letting his father die, to the corny kiss between Clark and Louis right before the fight with Zod which I saw coming from a mile away.<br /><br />The corniest part of the movie was when the army general said what the F when superman destroyed the drone. I know the movie is PG-13, but come on. Just don't use it then. I left the theater at that point even though the movie was already almost over. I am embarrassed for Christopher Nolan. To have his name associated with this typical Zack Snyder garbage movie has tainted his film making prowess. Hopefully he will take over directorial duties for the sequel.d Louis right before the fight with Zod which I saw coming from a mile away.<br /><br />The corniest part of the movie was when the army general said what the F when superman destroyed the drone.

1400032717|4.0|This fun loving book took me into the mind of an obsessive compulsive little boy (Christopher) who is widely gifted at math skills, but lacking in other social skills.  The story is cloaked as a mystery, but is more of a love story between a Father who desperately loves his little boy and in an effort to protect him, almost loses the love that fuels his life.<br /><br />Haddon begins the story with a shocking realization that a dog was found dead with a pitchfork stabbed brutally through his body.  Christopher decides that it was his mission to find out who had killed the dog right in the yard adjacent to his house.  His investigation infuriates his Dad who insists is causing other people problems.  Christopher is advised to keep out of others business and to leave the investigation alone.<br /><br />As we join Christopher on his journey to get to the bottom of the murder we discover the mystery is deeply connected to his life and come dangerously close to a fragile flash point that the reader can feel will destroy the little boy.<br />Although very predictable, this easy read touch my heart.  I felt a compassion for Christopher as I discovered it was his Father who killed the dog.  We discover the difficulties of divorce and all the pain that surrounds such a dramatic event.  Christopher’s Father had lied to his son to keep him from knowing that his Mother ran off with the neighbor’s husband.  Christopher thinks that his Mother had died of a heart attack, but during the investigation he find out that not only is she alive, but she has been writing to him and was living in a nearby city.<br /><br />Christopher finds out that his Father was the one that killed the dog, and this scared Christopher, causing him to give his Father the slip and run away to live with his Mother.  This turn of events turns the book from mystery to adventure as the young boy takes on the train system and the adventure of finding his Mother’s house which he had never been to before.<br />The story concludes with a less than triumphant finish.  I was left wanting more from the book, but still felt better for having read the story./>The story concludes with a less than triumphant finish.

0062255657|4.0|I can't quite categorise &#34;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&#34; by Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />&#34;The moon was a thin white smile.&#34;<br /><br />It lives comfortably in fable-land, the young adult genre, and literary fiction, and it transcends all of these as well. (I can easily see it as a film too.)<br /><br />&#34;When you are seven, beauty is an abstraction, not an imperative.&#34;<br /><br />It's the story of a beautiful and terrifying summer in the life of a 7 year old boy in the English countryside in the 1960s (as remembered by his adult self).<br /><br />&#34;The cloudless sky was plashed with stars beyond all counting.&#34;<br /><br />As propulsive as the book is (it's a quick quick read), the magic is in Mr. Gaiman's lyrical language. He remakes the oft rhapsodized English countryside into a fairyland, so immediate and sensate, it's impossible not to feel as if you're there.<br /><br />&#34;I knew it in the way I knew that grass was green, that roses had sharp, woody thorns.&#34;<br /><br />I found the descriptions of the meals particularly satisfying.<br /><br />&#34;As each pancake was done, Lettie would squeeze lemon onto it, and plop a blob of plum jam into the center, and roll it tightly, like a cigar.&#34;<br /><br />And I loved the intense scientific and literary pursuits of the young narrator: the girls' adventure books he read (as per his mother's collection) and his various chemistry experiments.<br /><br />&#34;if you take an egg, and blacken it completely with soot from a candle flame, and then put it into a clear container filled with salt water, it will hang in the middle of the water, and it will seem to be silver: a peculiar, artificial sliver, that is only a trick of the light.&#34;<br /><br />In his acknowledgements, Mr. Gaiman says, &#34;Words save our lives, sometimes.&#34; There's something about this book that feels redemptive, embodying the power of storytelling in an ocean in a bucket, a bitter orange sky.

B008JD7VZM|4.0|We bought this for our 6 year old son for Christmas because he told Santa that he wants it. The box is small, but these are Micro sized. For some reason, there don't seem to be any regular size Minecraft LEGO sets, but based on how much fun our son has with all of his other Minecraft toys, I know he'll enjoy this set, and the smaller size will be easier for his little fingers. The price is too high, but this is a popular item right now, and Christmas is close.
B00E9P959O|1.0|While I appreciate that the mud is gone, this new mix lacks ANY punch at all. It's very thin and tinny. I didn't even bother listening to the whole CD, I gave up 4 or 5 tracks in. Maybe the original masters are bad, so they tried to do the best with what they had. If that's the case, they shouldn't have even bothered. Very disappointed.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Most of the principles laid out in this book were not new to me but I never understood them in the depth that Dr Perlmutter explains them. My family has already followed the gluten-free, low-carb lifestyle, but I definitely slip at times and allow sugar to sneak back in. This book motivated me to get back on the program. Also, understanding better the connection between carbs and brain function helps me stay the course especially when it comes to my kids when they ask for a treat. Great book, I think everyone should read it but I think that parents should pay special attention. As adults, we may already be struggling with chronic disease but we owe it to our children to give them a healthy start and healthy eating habits for life.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's OK but Roku seems to be faster at streaming. Still, it works fine and the price is good. Easy set up.

B009KKLQVS|2.0|I'm a life-long fan, but have never actually seen the Beach Boys perform. I really, really wanted to like this and believe that the Beach Boys still &#34;had it,&#34; but sadly, it's not the case. Let's be honest, the rare presence of Brian Wilson was the attraction of this tour as well as this DVD and CD. So the biggest disappointment was that Brian rarely actually sang. Most of his many, many falsetto parts were sung by a non-Beach Boy, Jeff Foskett. Per Wikipedia / Los Angeles Times: &#34;Al Jardine stated, 'Jeffrey is invaluable to keeping the continuity between the various component parts. He supports Brian in every possible way. He has Brian's confidence, and basically kind of makes it possible to have Brian Wilson on the road with us. [Without] that shoulder to lean on, I think it would be very difficult for Brian to tour. And I'm very grateful for that.' &#34; There were about five of these extra musicians, who appeared to play and sing the entire concert while the aging originals contributed when they chose to.<br /><br />Brian appeared to spend the entire concert seated at the grand piano. When he sang, he was reading from a prominent teleprompter. The best part was a very touching and understated &#34;Heroes and Villains, with Brian singing throughout, followed by snippets of &#34;Sloop John B&#34; and &#34;Wouldn't It Be Nice.&#34; This was really the only section where he showed up. I didn't know that Al Jardine sang lead on &#34;Help Me Rhonda,&#34; but he provided the only other bright spot.<br /><br />The saddest part of all was on &#34;Fun, Fun Fun,&#34; the final track. Brian stood up near center stage with a bass slung over his shoulder. He sort of attempted to play, but I don't know if it was plugged in or if he was even miked up. The producers should have allowed him more dignity :(
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Awesome game. Variable difficulty depending on how many hints you chose to take.  Puzzles can be solved in different orders. It's a little on the short side, but really fun.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So if you're reading my review, you probably already have a general idea of what the Chromecast is about. I'm not going to regurgitate the technicalities of what Chromecast does like the other reviewers before me have done already. What I will tell you though, is why I personally like the Chromecast device.<br /><br />First and foremost, my family is a *HEAVY* user of Netflix. I purchased my first Chromecast as a \\"test\\" to see if it was really worth the $35 back when they first released it.  A few months later, I'm buying my second one for another room.<br /><br />As of this writing (12/3/2013), Chromecast currently supports Netflix, YouTube, HBO GO, Hulu Plus, Pandora, and Google Play Movies and Music mobile apps and streaming through the Chrome PC browser.  If you have any of those apps on your mobile device and it is the latest version, you will automatically have the ability to \\"cast\\" to the Chromecast from within the App.  If on Chrome PC, you download the \\"Google Cast\\" extension for your Chrome browser.<br /><br />I do not have HBO Go or Hulu Plus. Nor do I use Pandora or Google Play Movies.  On occasion, I will cast YouTube and it works as expected.<br /><br />Netflix App Performance:<br />The app performance is wonderful.  It actually seems to be faster than compared to my Vizio Smart TV Netflix App as well as my Western Digital SMP app.  Videos queue very quickly.  The *ONLY* beef I have with the Netflix App is specific to when you're watching TV shows on Netflix.  All other Netflix Apps on my TV, media players, phone, iPad, Xbox360 will automatically play the next episode.  It doesn't do this on the Chromecast.  So when a TV episode is over, I have to whip up the app again and manually select the next TV episode.<br /><br />Setup:<br />The setup is easy and the only requirements are:<br />1. That you have WiFi in your location.<br />2. A mobile device (Android or IOS) OR PC to use a a cast \\"source\\"<br />3. The mobile device and/or PC is on the SAME network as your Chromecast. For most of you, that means they are connected to the same router you have in your home (whether wired or wirelessly).<br />4. You have the Chromecast App on your mobile device or the Chrome browser w/ Google Cast extension on your PC for the initial setup process.<br />5. The support app is the latest version that supports Chromecast.<br /><br />The reason I give this device 5 stars is because of the price and potential.  I can't think of a cheaper device to let me play my Netflix on my TV.  Plus many of you are complaining that there's not enough \\"apps\\" supported by the Chromecast, but be aware that it is in its infancy.  The SDK (software development kit) is currently not available, so homebrew folks and companies can't support it yet.  There are alternatives in \\"beta testing\\" where you can cast stuff other than the current apps, but it will take time.  I'm sure in a year from now, we'll see a lot more apps supported, whether official or unofficial. But coming from just someone who uses Netflix, I couldn't be happier.as your Chromecast.

B000NY17J6|5.0|Terrific collection of hits from Ronstadt's country rockin'  heyday.  Her albums and live vocals were true treasures because her voice was so clear, so powerful, so delicate and often so heartbreaking . She wrapped that voice around the greatest songs and never sings with vanity just pure emotion and joy even when the song is one of the saddest ever &#34;Long Long Time&#34;.  Her hits are but a small sample of the Ronstadt musical legacy but they are certainly worth the price for a great musical ride with Linda.  She'll always be in my Hall of Fame.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|I first saw this &#34;remake&#34; on one of the premium pay channels last year (2012). I had no idea another remake of the 1982 masterpiece was even made. I watched it and was pleasantly surprised...it's not a remake, but a prequel. And even though I hate prequels, this movie is one of those rare exceptions (it is totally story driven and doesn't involve any of the previous cast members).<br /><br />As a big fan of John Carpenter's 1982 film, I can honestly say I LOVE this movie. It flows seamlessly with the 1982 film version. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Kate (who's obviously not a basketball fan) was the perfect heroine; fantastic performance as the pretty, bright, strong-willed young researcher.<br /><br />The action is fast and starts almost immediately with the thing breaking out of the ice. The attention to detail of recreating the Norwegian camp is outstanding, especially the recreation of the freezer room where they stored the block of ice. Just like in the 1982 film. And the guy frozen in the chair with the razor in one of the final scenes. I believe the ax was in the door, not the wall wasn't it? The door Macready forces open when he and Cooper investigate the burnt out Norg camp.<br /><br />Winstead's acting was top rate. I loved her reaction to the horror of the thing when Juliette transforms and tries to grab her; Kate flees and the thing nabs an unsuspecting victim in the hallway who stepped out to investigate the commotion. Kate slams the door and others rush to the scene; Kate is so freaked out of her mind she can't speak. That kind of attention to detail is priceless. (try speaking a coherent sentence when you're scared sh*tless)<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes is when Kate performs the alien test (&#34;There's a storm hitting us in 6 hours...we're gonna find out who's who&#34;) by looking for fillings in their molars. &#34;She's clever&#34; as the alien impostor says in Norwegian to the other. I love the defensive stare that Peder and Kate shootback at them.<br /><br />Another favorite scene is one of the last scenes when Kate and Carter escape the ship and prepare to leave in the snow cat. She starts to lean in to the cab and notices the missing earring. She calmly excuses herself as she puts her pack in the back and returns holding a torch. She explains to Carter how she knew he was human or not. &#34;Your earring&#34;...puzzled he reaches for the wrong ear...&#34;it was your other ear.&#34; Ignoring his pleas to stop, she torches the fake Carter. Very clever girl.<br /><br />If you love JC's 1982 movie, then you'll love this prequel. At the very end when the &#34;Norg&#34; helicopter sets down looking for survivors...out pops Lars with the HK and the husky jumps out the window and it begins. Queue base guitar. I LOVE it. The only thing missing was a cameo by MacReady from the 1982 film--him stepping out of his shack with the bottle of whiskey putting on his sunglasses as the helicopter buzzes the camp. That would have been even better.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My fifth grader who is a very reluctant reader had this as a class assignment and suggested that I read it. I was so happy that she had made a connection with a book that I decided to read along. We've discussed the characters in the book and talked about their motivations. We've asked each other how difficult would it be to be Auggie's friend? We both would like to believe that we have more of Summer in us than Julian.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Intense movie. An all time favorite of mine. Beautiful images of heaven. Great acting. This is a tear jerker, not for younger children.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Couldn't stop reading. Can't wait for the movie to come out. This is a great book for anyone to read who wants to feel good about their country!
B001O1O71C|5.0|this book is great# I loved it! but yet it was soon sad. the book was so much better than the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best! I used to use survival craft then I saw this, got caught up with this! Everyone will love this (I think). It only needs breeding animals, wolves, tigers, training pigs cows sheep chickens monsters dogs and cats, horses, zebras, taming the wild cats and wolves, engines, wheels, boats, cars, trains, skins, more monsters, saddles, spears, ramps, heads, and more blocks! PLEASE make an update with these blocks, animals, vehicles, and heads if you see this!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was stunned that I didn't hate this book. I figured that it was going to destroy what The Shining was all about... I was wrong!<br /><br />It was like bumping into an old friend - getting caught up with Dan Torrance and finding out where this story went was quite an experience. I couldn't be happier that Stephen King chose to continue this story, as it was so influential on many levels, and I think for true fans, the story needed to be finished.<br /><br />Character development was excellent. You could definitely feel that the middle-aged Dan Torrance was the grown version of the disturbing kid in The Shining. The characters that were added (Abra and others) made the story current and interesting in a way that was unexpected and very welcome. Abra was a stroke of brilliance, as the story needed to still have that innocence of childhood aspect for authenticity. Before reading the book, I felt that King was going to have to throw in characters that didn't fit - how could there be characters that weren't directly related to The Overlook? I'm thrilled to say that King's vision was much more than I could have imagined (as always), and all of the characters were interesting and natural fits for this story.<br /><br />There was nothing that I felt was out of place or awkward in Doctor Sleep. It flowed well, and concluded in classic Stephen King form. Anyone reading this and comparing it to The Shining should feel it is a natural progression, as more than 30 years separates the two stories, yet it is unmistakably the sequel to The Shining. Stephen King is at the very pinnacle of writing brilliance in this story.<br /><br />I rate this book as highly as possible because I believe it deserves 5 stars... more, if I could! There is no reason to not recommend this book to all lovers of outstanding storytelling.
0131480057|5.0|This is a great reference! It tells you everything you need to know. I have both this book and the Linux Bible eighth edition. They both have their strong points but I couldn't decide to purchase one over the other. I would more lean towards this book however I did buy both.

B00EY8A6BC|1.0|(SPOILERS)<br /><br />This movie is a religious-fest disguised as a psychological thriller.  As far as I can tell, the only reason it has gotten rave reviews is because of how much it bashes non-believers and masturbates the egos of believers.  The entire movie - amid horrible dialogue and plot holes - is spent hammering in the idea that magic is important and that it's OK to lie to people about it, as long as the lie makes them feel good.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, Morgan Freeman winds up in prison, framed by the movie's heroes (the magicians) for the crimes that they committed.  I am not exaggerating when I say that Morgan Freeman does nothing illegal or even unethical for the entire movie.  He shows the public how the main characters' magic acts are done, so people know that it is not real magic; for that alone, we are apparently expected to sympathize with his being framed.  After all...how dare someone replace hope and awe with truth.  Truth has no value, and is apparently an evil in this movie.<br /><br />As far as plot holes, they are &#34;filled up&#34; with such unbelievably mashed together junk, that I laughed out loud more than once.  For example, we see a main magician die in a car accident.  He clearly flips in his car, and the car explodes.  Of course, by this point in the movie, I know he couldn't possibly be dead, so it's not even surprising when you find out that he isn't...but I never would have guessed how stupidly this would be explained.  The movie takes us back in time to show how another magician (who somehow knew that the car chase would be at a specific part of a bridge during a specific time in the chase) happens to be driving a city bus, which apparently nobody noticed drove to the bridge equipped with a vehicle on the front exactly like the one the other magician is driving.  So we're supposed to believe that the vehicles were switched, and the one on the bus is the one that really crashed.  But what about the body?  The movie then takes us even further back in time, to show that a cadaver was stolen from a mortuary for this feat.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, the main magicians have committed grand larceny, hijacked a city bus, and stolen and destroyed the cadaver of some random family.  Yet we are STILL expected to cheer for them and jeer at Morgan Freeman, because the magicians did all of this to give some people hope, and Freeman let everyone know what a sham they were.en takes us even further back in time, to show that a cadaver was stolen from a mortuary for this feat.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, the main magicians have committed grand larceny, hijacked a city bus, and stolen and destroyed the cadaver of some random family.

B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|1980's drum machine doesn't cut it.  For a man that considers himself a perfectionist I thought Tom S. could afford a live studio drummer.  This album does not meet pedestrian standards for so many reasons . Not worth ten dollars. Buy the family something else for Christmas. I loved Boston when they &#34;were&#34; Boston. Go back to &#34;the&#34; Boston of old and love true greatness.  This one hurts and it hurts me to say so. I am anxious to read a positive review of this album, I just don't know that one can be honestly written.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|This book rambled on ..... at times pages and pages said absolutely nothing at all. The storyline was not to my liking either, there is no good guy. I'm a huge Grisham fan but I did not like this book.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very easy to read and use. I like that the numbers are so big and it takes up the entire screen.
B008602KQI|5.0|I thought the movie did a great job of following the plot of the novel.  I really liked the black and white parts that depicted the dreariness of Katnis's home place.  Also her dress as she turned and it resembled the flames.  Signed E.R.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My grandparents on my father's side both died from cancer.  As did my great aunt.  The idea that not all cancer patients are the same is just now occurring to me.  My grandfather was happy despite his sickness.  He helped my sisters and I throw my mother a surprise birthday party from a wheelchair.  I don't really remember my grandmother very much, but I know that she was mostly happy, but also had moments of deep sadness.  My great aunt was very optimistic and strong, but cancer was stronger.  Like it is said in the book, &#34;pain demands to be felt.&#34;  My great aunt felt it.  And so did my grandparents.  This book is emotion shaped like a book.  It isn't fake, or guesswork, or one of those sentimental feel good cancer books.  It is feeling.  It is not how cancer takes life from people(and it does), it is how cancer gives emotions to people.  Emotions that are strong or weak or just different altogether.  This book changed me.  I am not entirely sure how yet, but I am positive it will help me understand the universe,who really only wants to be noticed, a little better.  I hope this book changes everyone in some way, because this book is only a good one, if it changes you.  For better or worse.

044024367X|1.0|I have been slowly winding my way through the Reacher books by publication date. This book was a huge miss with considerable aimless filler involving nighttime walks and other irrelevant plot points. I think Child sleepwalked through this one or rattled it out for a paycheck. Yes, there are Reacher moments of sudden fury but they don't make up for the yawns throughout most of the book. And the plot discoveries? Oh goodness... beyond believable. First time I have ever skimmed through a Reacher book, especially the last fifty pages or so. Nothing to Lose? Yes, time I wish I had back.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Explanation:<br />Allegiant opens with the discontent people of Chicago hoping to make a stand against the Factionless. The discontent, become the Allegiant, a small group revolting against Evelyn Johnson, the new leader. The Allegiant want to find answers and resolve order to the city of Chicago. Tobias, Tris and their friends are chosen to go where no one else has gone before, outside the city limits into the world beyond. In leaving the city they enter a society they know nothing about.  Here they learn the truth about their home, and must decide what to do with this knowledge. The Allegiant have two choices- to assist the citizens of this strange new world and walk away from the only home they have known or to fight for the people they have left behind.<br /><br />Opinion:<br />Every once in a while a book comes along that is so different, exhilarating and refreshing that it takes your breath away- Allegiant is one of those books! Veronica Roth elevated Allegiant from what could have potentially been a mediocre read to an EPIC novel, by creating a diverse and unpredictable plot. How do you make a book truly EPIC? You leave the reader reeling, with the most unsatisfied taste in their mouth after turning the last page! This feeling makes the reader ponder what could have been, long after the book was completed.<br /><br />When I first began reading this book I did find it a bit ‘ho-hum’. It took me a week to get halfway through and I really wasn’t interested in getting to the end because I thought I knew exactly what was coming- oh how wrong I was! I think my reluctance to read the book too quickly was also because I didn’t like some of the earlier revelations in the book, and I didn’t want to know how anything else could damage these characters.  I preserved though and all I can say is wow, Veronica Roth, WOW!<br /><br />Roth also did not do the one thing that turned Stephanie Meyer’s Twilight Series into a mediocre read. She did not close every looseend up by the conclusion of the book. Now I am a fan of stories being completed properly, and I hate movies that leave you guessing. But Roth created her story without its neatly packed endings, which elevates this book to the beyond impressive level.<br /><br />The dual perspective writing also gave more insight into both Tris and Tobias‘s thoughts and feelings. The previous two books in the Divergent Series are told only from Tris’s point of view. That sufficed for those books, but Allegiant very much needed the two viewpoints in order for the reader to understand the whole story. Tobias’s point of view allowed the reader to see how deeply he cared for Tris and how much his parents have impacted upon his life choices. Tris’s chapters were written in the same strong, determined and selfless voice of the heroine we know and love.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Allegiant could have been just another nice, teen book series where the heroine always gets what they want. Instead Roth has turned it into a best seller. Allegiant was fantastic. The Divergent Series was amazing! The movies are going to be phenomenal! Kudos to Veronica Roth!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys are really passionate about what they do and this CD really inspired me to take Piano more seriously! :D
034580404X|5.0|I've read through the series and thought it was a very well written love story. I think people are scared off by the thought that this could be considered erotica, but it is tastefully written and not THAT unusual.  Granted, I've only read through the second book, but the worst that was printed was spanking and a few sex toys.  The author makes you care about the characters and the life they lead.  I'd recommend it to those that like love stories.
B008JFUORW|5.0|received brand new movie in perfect time and condition , added to my hangover collection. completely satisfied Merry Christmas and Happy New Year

B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Great album.  Mark Tremonti has reached a new level of guitar playing.  He has definitely added more melodic arrangements in his soloing.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|The first book i read in six years. Blends together facts to draw patterns. Overall a good read. Being from the human resources field the cultural and eduacation oriented segments were more relevant. Really liked the narration style.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|My girlfriend and I watched this last and it was so funny! I've seen the first one, she hasn't and we both really enjoyed the humor and action that all the characters brought in Red 2. Story telly was briefly shaky at times, but overall, we were thoroughly entertained.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series was hard to put down- read the 3 books in 10 days. I laughed and cried as I got through it
1613771355|5.0|When I bought this, we went to see Peter Beagle and the screening of the Last Unicorn. The illustrations in this are delightful and it closely follows the book, which is great.

B00338QENI|5.0|I had no idea biographies could be so fun to read. Well, I did read John Adams, but I didn't think I would find any other biographers with a sense of humor in their writing. Rebecca Skloot takes us honestly through her experience of interviewing the relatives of Henrietta Lacks, the researchers and institutions who have immortalized her cells. She sews the whole thing up in a humanly accessible book. By the end of the book, I had a new found appreciation for the distrust poor black citizens have held for doctors and hospitals and how undefined ethics of the early 19th century medical field caused one woman to be the saving grace of so many.
B005QMOZOO|2.0|I don't see the point of this book.  I love Pride and Prejudice and I enjoy P.D.James but this book was completely pointless.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|funny as hell! Crude entertainment but hilarious in nature. I highly recommend this movie for its comedy and clever one liners!
B008AX1HD8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Nesbo did well to capture the essence of Australia and the storyline was engaging.  I particularly like the storytelling element within the story...I think Nesbo retells some dreamtime stories better than some books dedicated to the task.  I am interested in following Harry Hole's character in Nesbo's subsequent novels.
B008Q08EG8|3.0|Good performances by some great actors - John Wayne, James Stewart, Lee Marvin, Vera Miles.  Not too many really good films that you get to see Vera Miles perform in.  It's a shame.  I recommend the movie.

B0036S4B6M|4.0|The book is interesting and addresses social issues within the prison system.  4 stars because it lacks excitement or suspense, but then it is about prison!  It's well written and extremely interesting.  I really do like it alot.

B000JLQSW4|5.0|I was never a big fan of &#34;techno&#34; music; not that I listened to much of it anyway. I was aware of it when it first evolved  but easily  set it aside in favour of the Stones and the Beatles ( to name a few) .And therein lay the problem because once I did listen to this album I was entranced and now I am hooked.<br /><br />The &#34;Alan Parsons Project&#34;  is compelling, irresistable and actually  very nice to listen to. Its not new of course, coming from 1977 but it still works its magic ...Enjoy
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved the book. Interesting and tidy. Characters live through the most dreadful times in history without loosing themselves. They grow, some of them learn.. Time passes by and they remain true to their nature. I was very sorry about Walter and Maud. I'm loosing forward to reading the following novel in the trilogy.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The thing I love most about The Piano Guys is the variety of their music styles.  Each song has its own style and personality so it doesn't feel repetitive.  This is a great album that is sure to make its way into your Christmas rotation!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved all three books. The movie was true to the first one. Jennifer Lawrence was wonderful in the role of Katniss.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|The book is ten years old and you sit on the reserved list for WEEKS in my public library system.  I couldn't read it all in the time given to borrow.  A friend recommended that rather than rack up late fees, getting it on my Kindle app.  Now I have it to read at my leisure.  Shantaram is a compelling story that draws you deeper and deeper in to Lin's life, thoughts, regrets, and hopes.  I am looking forward to the completion - the discussion at book club should be quite lively and with varying opinions.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book is an engaging, charming, and well-written glimpse into the less-than-perfect life of a teenage girl who is struggling with issues no child should have to face. The author does an excellent job of pulling us into Eleanor's world, one that is both realistically portrayed and depressingly accurate. The bullying, the pressure to be cool or at least fly under the radar, all of it brought back some bitter and painful memories from my own high school experience. I could not put down this book and read it in two days.
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|Well made, stitching, buckles and closures are nice. It adjusted to me easily. I am on the large side and it fit perfectly. I am looking forward to many shooting classes and uses in the field for this item.

B000FC1MCS|5.0|I read this book because my 7th grade daughter has to read it for her English class.  She has a brilliant teacher. I not only enjoyed it, but was completely absorbed.  Recommend to anyone who enjoys an enticing creatively written story.  I researched Mark Haddon and  was amazed that he did little research on Aspergers.  Loved It!
B00BEIYL6G|3.0|Watching “Jobs,” a biographical picture of Steve Jobs, is like reading a student study guide of Shakespeare. You will know someone’s life story full of events, the ups and downs (and ups) of a complex person, but you will not get interested in or feel anything about the person himself very much. You may learn some facts, with many visual details (including the actual garage where Steve Jobs and his friends worked on their project), but you do not learn much about the man’s personality.<br /><br />The problem is simple: the film’s narrative structure. Written by first-time writer Matt Whiteley and directed by Joshua Michael Stern (“Neverwas” “Swing Vote”), “Jobs” begins with Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) introducing the iPod in 2001. Then the film flashbacks to the 1970s, when he has just dropped out from college and travelled in India.<br /><br />So far, that’s fine, but then the film jumps from one episode to another without developing the central character of Jobs. You don’t have to cover every episode in his life (and we have already a made-for-TV film “Pirates of Silicon Valley”), but at least you have to present your own version of what the man is really like, which somehow “Jobs” is afraid of doing.<br /><br />The idea of Ashton Kutcher playing Steve Jobs was something unexpected to me, but to his credit, he did a very good job. While watching “Jobs,” however, I kept thinking of another bio-pic that was about another influential figure. It was “The Social Network,” a biographical film of Mark Zuckerberg, and David Fincher knew what he was doing when portraying the Facebook creator in the opening bar scene. Perhaps it is his incisive vision or touch that is missing in “Jobs.”
B003TSEEDY|4.0|A troubled young man writes his feelings down in letters to a stranger that he overheard someone praising for not sleeping with a drunken girl at a party.  It is thru these letters that you can't help but be as concerned for him as everyone in his life is just by his actions. The book kept my interest all the way to the very end when the young man finally figures out the surprising reason why he is different from everyone he knows. I didn't see the end coming and I always enjoy a book more that way. A good read!
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|one of the best movies ever, nice execution and one of the best stories that you can found on a unnormal way to look the world
B004UBB3KQ|5.0|While criticism of this music may be valid it, nevertheless, speaks to a contemporary reality. Vinyl and VED's (vacuum electron devices) a.k.a. \\"Tubes\\" remain a significant source of [my] pleasure.<br />Vinyl [essentially] rules, especially when processed through KT-88's.<br />Thank you for having the foresight to make this format available. Brilliant. .
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys are wonderful family entertainment.  Their music is beautiful, innovative, and family friendly -- it is what we had blasting this year as we decorated the tree with our children.  Thank you for that -- and thank you to TPG for letting kids know how cool it is to love your instruments and to embrace your talent.  My 11-year old son and I attended the TPG show in Boston during the World Series, and we both had such a memorable night.<br /><br />Definitely worth adding to your holiday musical collection!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Just beautiful - they have chosen a good mix of favorites, with The Piano Guys own particular flavor. It is good when folks are talented enough to make something their own without distorting it or making it unrecognizable.
B008602KQI|5.0|Awesome book and awesome movie.  The series of three books were very exciting to read.  The series reminds me to Harry Potter series.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|At first I didn't think I would like this movie very much. But I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the little minions were hilarious. I completely recommend this as a nice family film.
B001YV502C|5.0|Good movie, nice quality, love this movie for so long, so I need to have it. hope you do enjoy it
B008JFURKG|1.0|Netflix version of this Blu-Ray disc won't play in a BD390 Blu-Ray player.  Tried two different copies.  First disc I've seen that won't play in this player.
1611762022|5.0|This was a good epic story  mixing factual places and people with fictional characters. The writing was very good evocative of the many scenarios it took us to. Alma was an interesting, intelligent, unusual, brave and yet character who continued to grow throughout every year of her long life. She knew about that which she wanted to learn. The reader was excellent .  The story was not predictable.<br />I really enjoyed every minute of it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was so happy to read about Danny.  A story that keeps you interested from the first word till the last.  One of my favorites.
B002LHTRV8|4.0|A true thriller that makes you wonder, surprises you, and the twists neat the end really become a true &#34;secret.&#34;  Johnny Depp plays the role very well and yet gives you an authentic writer who is haunted by his stolen script…or is he?
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! I bought this the day it came out (in October) and it rarely leaves my CD player. All your favorite holiday classics by wonderfully talented artists. Would recommend this as a gift to either yourself or someone else. :)
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I love the show and unfortunately watched it before reading book. Book seems to follow show to a tee almost. This to me is uncommon and made the book a slow hard boring read. This is probably the first time I will ever say the show was better.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|It works great. I think the puzzles may be misclassified a little. Some of the easy ones aren't too easy and some of the harder ones are. But this is a great little sudoku app.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Very informative and easy to use. I enjoyed the fact that there was information there for all ages, lots of really helpful information.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Creativity with a capital 'C'. The Piano Guys are the best! I love watching them enjoy their music!!! There is nothing more classic than a piano and a cello but they do the classics with their own passion.
B00013AXEE|4.0|First, confessions. I rarely read fiction.  I may be the only reviewer of this book who's never read a Stephen King novel or seen a movie based on one.  King alludes to a \\"large segment of the reading population who feel that fiction is somehow immoral, a low taste.\\" (228)  I won't sign on that particular dotted line; but I do prefer the kind of fiction that King despises, fiction intended to modify the reader's perceptions and behavior, didactic works like Pilgrim's Progress, Pride and Prejudice, The Jungle, and Screwtape Letters.  For me, life's too short to waste on horror stories, even in airports and hotel rooms.<br /><br />I took up this book because I teach nonfiction writing and wanted to compare King's advice with my own.  There's some overlap but also a decent gulf between the genres.  King rightly emphasizes that serious writers have to be good readers and that they have to write \\"for the pure joy of the thing.\\"  He also stresses Strunk's Rule 13: \\"Omit needless words\\" (though King himself retains plenty of unnecessary four-letter words--and their verbal and adjectival forms--which deliciously enough, he remembers his mother calling \\"the language of the ignorant.\\") (186)<br /><br />Unlike a novelist, the nonfiction writer can't let his characters wander about the tale as they choose.  Presenting a compelling story is important to all writers who want to be read, but by definition a historical event has a preexisting structure that can't be ignored.  A historian can't eliminate characters or ideas because they're boring or slow the pace of the tale.  Research is essential to a nonfiction writer's reputation, not, as in the novelist's case, a casual bid for verisimilitude.<br /><br />What I found most engaging about King's book was not his advice about writing fiction but his attempts at writing nonfiction, his stabs at autobiography that fill about half the book.  There is some fine work there, passages I can recommend to students.  King admits that writing them \\"was a kind of torture.\\" (265)g them \\"was a kind of torture.\\" (265)
B00EJYGQFG|5.0|Love this song! Took a couple times to listen before I got into it.  The full album compliments this song as well.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|We really enjoyed the movie, had a slightly different story line for the beginning that was very well done. Looking forward to the sequel.
0307914550|5.0|One of my favorite books in the past five years.<br />fantastic story, well told, learned a ton about history of running and running shoes
B00FQMVCEA|5.0|My 3 year old asks to watch this movie every morning.  I'm giving it 5 stars because I'm pretty sure he loves Planes.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|I LOVED this movie!! I'm a huge fan of the original, but this one is just as good, if not better! It's brutal and not for those women who have been assaulted.
0446672653|4.0|I enjoyed and read it in very few days. It is not boring and much pleasant reading for those sharing the believe on past lives.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Works great.  I was just about to buy a new adapter but came across this.  I thought I would lose it but it stays connected well.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|This has to be very near the top of my list of all-time favorite albums. I bought the MP3 album and listen on the computer or my tablet. And it's a good thing, because if this were a CD, I would have worn it out by now, because I play it over and over. The music is lush, rich, melodious. Listening with headphones, it surrounds me and pulls me in. When I reach my favorite track &#34;The Lady Calipha,&#34; I just close my eyes and listen with my soul, and for a few minutes I am 100% in the moment, inside this glorious music. Maybe you can tell... I love it.
B0030GCZP4|4.0|Sergeant Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) gives rookie cop Jake (Ethan Hawke) one day to prove his mettle for Alonzo's narcotics team.  The day takes Jake through frightening and demanding challenges, forcing decisions in the face of anguishing ambiguity.  Alonzo is tough, charismatic, and a legend in the department.  He makes a good case for his questionable actions.  Jake must make choices in dangerous circumstances, both learning from his superior officer and, as he sees the level of Alonzo's wrongdoing, choosing when to challenge him.  Near the end the movie veers toward the improbable, but the overall effect left my knees weak.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|Using it to sync computer clock to GPS time. Works better than I thought it would.  Software could be better, I lose com port assignment periodically.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app is an absolute must have! It allows many different customizable placement options that allows SwiftKey to look and feel great on any phone! The predictive text is almost flawless!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I installed this app because I was tired of my Kindle fire hanging up on the Weather Channel's version. I'm glad I did -- not only does it work better on my device, I also prefer the way this one is laid out.
0440178002|5.0|The book itself from story view point was nice and intense there is a lot of action and if you dismiss some inaccuracy (historical) it is a good reading.<br /><br />I did not like the many dramatizations overusing same 5-6 adjectives to make story/scene more vivid, from my view point its overdoing and unnecessary. And the love dialogs are cheesy and repetitive, essentially same.
B005LAIHCM|2.0|Make sure to check out my horror movie review blog at: brandoncsites.blogspot.com<br /><br />House at the End of the Street (2012) **<br />D: Mark Tonderai<br />C: Jennifer Lawrence, Max Thieriot, Elisabeth Shue, Gil Bellows, Eva Link, Nolan Gerard Funk, Allie MacDonald<br />P: Teenage girl (Lawrence) and her mother (Shue), seeking out a fresh start, move to a small town. There, they become intertwined in a mystery surrounding one of their neighbors - a teenage boy (Thieriot) whose family was murdered by his sister, who then mysteriously disappeared.<br /><br />House at the End of the Street is pretty much a TV movie in dress clothes. With a slightly larger budget and a raising actress (Lawrence), it got a major theatrical release while similar films would have either aired on TV or been released straight to DVD.<br /><br />The script is by the numbers. All the answers to the mystery that the film is spinning are rather obvious, so therefore a lot of potential suspense has been removed as well. Production values are average at best, though the entire cast does a competent job. It's just that we've seen this type of film so many times and this one doesn't even attempt to do anything to separate itself from all the others that came before it. House at the End of the Street is bland, forgettable and uneventful, but then again, what do you expect of a PG-13 rated horror film released in September with minimum ad support from its distributor?!? [PG-13] 101 mins.
B001IZIDHI|1.0|Arrived with cracked case, but opened it since I hadn't noticed the crack until I pulled the plastic wrapper off. Placed the cd into my stereo and toward the end of the first song, it began to skip and reverse and repeat what had just been played. I forwarded to the next song and the same happened and so on. Very disappointed so I returned it for a refund.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|This book has broken down barriers to really show how LIFE is conquered, and it isn't in the most typical suspected ways that one would think about either! Very well written and an excellent read too !
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game. Tells you the correct minimum number of moves to solve puzzle in. You can proceed through game by solving puzzles or go back and resolve if you strive for perfection. Hints available for coins that you collect. Also other things available to collect (but very difficult to break out the jewels and get perfect score to collect coin, have to go back for both mostly) and i believe purchase but i have that turned off. Music is personal but its sort of celtic woodsy. Graphics are quite good. Lots of variations as levels progress. Simple but very nice.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Was a fun game to play will play it again. It is a good look and find game to play
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Love these guys! Every single time I hear their music I am inspired!! Love seeing them play live on YouTube also! So amazing.
B00ET2ODU8|2.0|Check out my cult film blog at: criticbrandoncsites.blogspot.com<br /><br />Lovelace (2013) **<br />D: Rob Epstein, Jeffrey Friedman<br />C: Amanda Seyfried, Peter Sarsgaard, Sharon Stone, Robert Patrick, Juno Temple, friend Adam Brody, Wes Bentley, Eric Roberts, James Franco, Chris Noth, Bobby Cannavale, Hank Azaria, Debi Mazar, Cory Hardrict, David Gueriera, Tyler Nusenow, Chloë Sevigny<br />P: A look into the life of 70's porn star Linda Lovelace, her abusive marriage to Chuck Traynor and her attempts to escape it all and start anew.<br /><br />Overly simplified, scattershot take on a complicated woman who lived a very complicated life. Overall, Lovelace is fascinated by two aspects of Linda Lovelace's life - her abusive marriage and her foray into the world of porn. By only presenting a partial picture into Lovelace's life, it's as though we are watching parts of a film, instead of getting the whole picture.<br /><br />In an effort to camaflogue the weakness of the material, a star studded cast is paraded in front of the screen. Most of them are given small supporting roles that don't amount to much. That's not to say that everyone is wasted.<br /><br />There are some powerful moments. When Linda Lovelace tries to have a heart to heart with her mom (played wonderfully by Sharon Stone) about her abusive marriage, there is something quite compelling and heartbreaking about their conversation. Or when Linda is confronted by her dad on the phone after having caught his daughter on the big screen, there is something quite genuine and tragic about this scene.<br /><br />These two moments provide us with meaningful glances into these characters and what they are all about. The rest of Lovelace seems fractured, segmented and, at times, superficial. The film we are presented with, feels like the notes someone took while writing and conceptualizing Lovelace, not the final draft. [R] 93 mins.
B00G2KV92U|5.0|Boston 6th studio album. Well worth the wait! Tom Scholz's latest effort included! Can't wait until they tour again soon!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|All about changing your view can change your life.  You can finish in a few hours.  Make the investment.  Just do it!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Enjoy the puzzles.  But there is way too much unnecessary dialogue<br />which detracts from rather than enhances the game.  That being said, since I can quickly tap through the dialogue, I recommend this game especially when it is<br />free!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like the challenge but I don't like how the game runs out of time. And I feel there should be more moves allowed for each challenge.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|Came free with my camera- compact, sturdy and just enough room for a quick photo session. Also, comfortable to haul around! Always a plus.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun and addictive. It is easy to make money without having to spend money. I would recommend this game to my friends.
B009TGODOK|4.0|Better than I thought it would be; I usually find over-hyped movies to be a letdown. I recommend watching it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really like this clock. It replaced my old alarm clock that took up space on the night stand. I leave the digital clock open at night while I'm charging my kindle and it stays bright all night. I just set my kindle up on my night stand. The alarm has been reliable and has not skipped a beat. Good app.
0812550706|5.0|Such an intelligent book, thought-provoking, covers so many human issues...it's simply timeless. First, it's as enjoyable to read as any great adventure story. But underlying the story are moral struggles with no simple answers. The &#34;good guys&#34; do bad things, and the &#34;bad guys&#34; are not all bad. Each character struggles with his/her own weaknesses, real and perceived. Perhaps I love the characters because they are very introspective. I love the story because war is certainly relevant and has no simple solution. I love the underlying theme of compassion...timeless.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|You use cards to place land on the board.  The landscape is always changing and so are the possibilities and the problems with opponents.  The tiles must match the tiles they are placed next to in order for the board to accept them.  A road has to connect to a road for example.  The game only allows legal moves and it has a good tutorial.  It helps you to learn the game faster.  Every player has 7 followers and after placing a tile you may select to place a follower on that tile. Ownership of the piece of land or city is based on who has the most followers on a certain tiles like a city, at the end of the game.  On some tiles your follower stays there and on others you can get them back if you control the city for example.<br /><br />You earn points for completing a road, one for each tile that the road passes through.  It is a fun game as you build your own world and spread your followers around. You earn points for adding and populating a city and also complete a cloister of land.  Move fast and don't make a mistake by not claiming a valuable piece of land.<br /><br />This is a fun and challenging game as every time you play it the layout and thus the world is different.  Your goal is to control the most land, cities and cloisters.  It reminds me of medieval Monopoly with a twist.  It is a faster moving game than you can imagine and a lot of fun.  It creates rivalries quickly for dominance of the board.  You can play other people or the AI.  This is a great game and I recommend that you quickly get it while it is the FAOTD.  I rate it at 5 stars.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|The puzzles and hidden picture games are beautifully done. There are several types of puzzles that keeps things interesting and the graphics are well defined. The plot is a bit draggy and the puzzles are somewhat repetitive, but they are so beautifully done, it's well worth the effort.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Incredible Christmas CD. The very first track, &#34;Angels We Have Heard on High&#34; puts me in the Christmas spirit in the first few bars. Their music is beautiful, their message is incredible, and these guys stay true to themselves as artists, husbands, friends, and fathers.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I like this game on my Kindle Fire.  Can take it with you anywhere.  When you want something to do besides reading a book while waiting for your laundry to finish or in a waiting room it fills the bill.  Solitaire is an incredible waste of time but this one pits you against your best time, so it adds another level of play.
0545626382|4.0|Nice boxset! Gave as a gift to a close friend, I'm pretty sure he loved it. I prefer hardback books, but these are quality paperbacks
B000A59PMO|5.0|This show is really fresh and smart and not at all what I expected.  Kristen Bell really nails this character and Veronica is not a simple character at all.  The mood of the show is surprisingly dark and the stories are complex but believable. Veronica seriously kicks ass without the aid of any super powers or firearms, but instead uses her wits and her moxie (and on rare occasions a taser).  What a concept!  And even though Veronica is literally feared by just about everyone in her high school because of her &#34;skills&#34;, she is a lonely outcast and she is still just a vulnerable teenage girl when it comes to many things.  Each episode has Veronica solving various and numerous problems for people in clever and inventive ways and also dealing with the usual issues of high school life as an outcast.  Additionally, there is a season long story arc about the murder of Veronica's best friend and as the season progresses Veronica learns more and more about the murder.  I am making this sound really simple but believe me there is a lot of complexity involved in these sub-plots.  The end of the season reaches a climax when the murderer is discovered and the ending resolution is suitably exciting, pretty believable, somewhat surprising, and very satisfying.  Each time I watch an episode of this show I feel a little smarter.  I think that means the writing is really good.  Overall, I highly recommend this series and I am really looking forward to watching season two.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Loved this game on Facebook and now it's on my kindle. Fun game but takes too much time do things.
B006H4DBA4|4.0|Very entertaining read. Kinsella has such a fun style of writing.you don't want to put the book down. Really want to read the end now!
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|I enjoyed the actual depiction of Superman and other characters here, especially with the flashback scenes. But as for the actual set up of the picture? It jumps around a lot and we don't get to let anything settle in or develop before it throws us into something else.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|I'm not into Robot boxing.  I realize robots are our future, but this fake stuff, I'm not into.  Some people like it but I don't care for it.
B000VZGK3K|3.0|This isn't Martin Scorsese's best film, but I think it gets a bad rap. Dicaprio delivers a great performance as the eccentric but brilliant aviator turned filmmaker, Howard Hughes. This is really a character study but Scorsese also makes this a film about filmmaking which for the casual viewer might not be that interesting, but anyone interested in the history of film and one of the mediums pioneers will really enjoy this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very entertaining. Have a hard time putting it down, once I start playing it. The only bad thing about this game is when you use up all of your lives. You have to wait between 10 to 20 minutes
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Totally engulfed in the characters stories; and what a cliffhanger at the end of the last episode. Excellent insight into the British culture at that time 1912 +. Really engaging and cast extremely well.  Really pulls you in.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My review hopefully will be helpful for all the parents out there.  I have four kids ranging in ages from 3-9.  Below is the reaction of each of my kids for each episode.  I will update this review as they watch each movie.  We started with Episode IV just like i did when i was a kid.  I hope this review will help you if you are trying to decide if your child will be interested based on their age.<br /><br />Episode IV : A New Hope<br />1 (Gender - Girl Age - 3) : Fell Asleep after 30 minutes.  She seemed interested in it, but at that age it seems like 30 minutes is the max attention you can get.<br />2 (Gender - Boy Age - 5) : Watched the entire thing.  At some moments he seemed to get a little scared but it would only last about 2 seconds and he was fine.<br />3 (Gender - Girl Age - 7) : Watched the whole thing and had questions the whole time.  Seemed to be very interested in the characters more than the battle and plot.<br />4 (Gender - Girl Age - 9) : The most interested of all the kids.  Didn't say anything the whole time.  After the movie was finished wanted to start Episode V<br /><br />Overall as a dad there was only a few parts i felt like maybe the kids should not see. My kids mostly watch the disney channel so this really was there first PG movie that they have seen.  The part where obi wan kenobi gets killed was a part that i looked over at the kids to see their reaction.  They all seemed fine.<br /><br />Episode V : The Empire Strikes Back<br />1 (Gender - Girl Age - 3) : Only lasted about 10 minutes and then was off to go play with her toys.<br />2 (Gender - Boy Age - 5) : Only lasted about 1 hour and asked me if we could start it over another day.<br />3 (Gender - Girl Age - 7) : Stopped watching after about 1 hour also, and said she was not into all the 'spaceship battles'.  She really liked the character portions of the movie and not so much the ship scenes.<br />4 (Gender - Girl Age - 9) : Once again was the most interested of all the kids.  Nevergot up once to leave, and didn't say anything during the movie.<br /><br />Overall this one was the least interesting for the kids between episode IV and V.  My oldest said that she liked the movie but liked episode IV better.  This had a few scenes that made me cringe for the kids.  When the Wampa caught Luke and held him in the cave.  The Wampa is sitting in the cave eating the Tauntaun.  Also, after Luke frees himself, he slices off the Wampa's arm.  Also, when Han rescues Luke in the snow, he slices open the Tauntaun's belly to place Luke inside.  All of these parts where a little uncomfortable for me as a dad with young kids.  Add in the part where Luke loses his arm to Vader and this movie between the two was a little worse in that way.<br /><br />Episode VI : Return of the Jedi<br />1 (Gender - Girl Age - 3) : Only lasted about 30 before she fell asleep.<br />2 (Gender - Boy Age - 5) : Watched the whole thing and was extremely interested.<br />3 (Gender - Girl Age - 7) : Loved the ewoks.  She was really into this movie.<br />4 (Gender - Girl Age - 9) : Understood the relationship between the different characters.  Really like the ewoks as well.  Seemed to be sad about Darth Vader's end.<br /><br />The kids loved this one.  The ewoks really captured the kids attention.  I think this movie helped peek their interest for the other three movies to come.<br /><br />Episode 1 : The Phantom Menace<br />1 (Gender - Girl Age - 3) : Was in and out of the room during the whole movie, but seemed to be more interested in this movie than any of the other three.<br />2 (Gender - Boy Age - 5) : Watched the whole thing and actually understood that Anakin was Darth Vader when he was younger.<br />3 (Gender - Girl Age - 7) : Loved the movie, especially the queen and when she revealed her true self before the battle it seemed to be a real nice surprise for her.<br />4 (Gender - Girl Age - 9) : Loved this movie as well.  The relationship between Anakin and The Queen really seemed to be of interest for both of my older girls.  Whereas my son seemed more interested in the battle scenes.<br /><br />I know the die-hard Star Wars people out there hate jar jar binks, but all four of my kids loved him.  They actually had a lego character of him and never new who he was.  Now after seeing him in the movie they were super excited to know who he was.  They laughed at him every time he did something dumb and kind of made the movie for them.  Of course the girls loved the queen also.  All the kids constantly want to know who is good and who is bad.  Part of me wants to tell them right away but I kept it secret like when I was younger.  They quickly seemed to understand who was good and who was bad.<br /><br />Episode 2 : Attack of the Clones<br />*will review once we have watched it together.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I tried to pay bills.  I added a new payee and after only 2 letters were entered, the program deleted my keyboard and gave a list that started with the 2 letters.  I repeated it over and over again to total frustration.  It also would not accept a quick logon.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I've been a Black Sabbath fan for many years,there have been 5 lead singers and of coarse ozzy is the best!!!R.I.P ronnie james Dio you were a great one. Tony martin {dean martin's son}  Gilmore had their shots ,and the other one I just can,t remember right now{Brain Fart}lol
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Love this film! Wes Anderson gets does all of the things that draw him criticism (i.e. quirky love story, bad dad, precious art direction, over head shots, check lists of items, etc.) but in this, his first period piece, it all comes together and meshes perfectly. There are some very cartoonish, out of this world moments in this movie that shouldn't make sense but do. The mail lead isn't always the most likable kid but the relationship between he and Suzy is so sweet that it can be forgiven. I also love Bruce Willis playing against type and that there is a character called Social Services.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very emotional and I couldn't stop at the end of any chapter. Literally finished this book in one and a half days. Best book series ever! Made me cry during the whole thing and even during the movies. I just love it soooo much! Every time I think about the books or the movies, I cry and get so emotional.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|If you know the Piano Guys and love them, then of course you will love this album too. If you don't know the Piano Guys, then get to! And if you know them and don't love them then there is something wrong with you. Their rendition of Oh Come Oh Come Emmanuel is one of the most beautiful pieces of music to ever pass my ears. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed in this album. I have been listening to it for weeks now. There other albums are just as wonderful.  I don't usually bother to review stuff, but the Piano Guys are worth it!!
1465414444|5.0|much bigger than expected. has beautiful graphics,  the print is nice and large too. Sturdy book. really beautiful and well worth the money highly recommend
B00DU74U74|2.0|Did not like the book. I could not follow the story, I thought it was me,  so I watched the movie (did not buy the DVD). I didn't even finish watching it. Very disappointed.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Epic Fail. The characters act in ways that they didn't in the first two books so they don't even seem to be the same characters. The love story becomes far too central and juvenile. The multiple deaths are without reason, adding nothing to the story but false drama. I'm very disappointed that what started out as a good series ended so terribly. I could barely get through it and had to skim the last 100 pages. The author completely lost her hold on the narrative. She should have just ended it after book 2. Or, I don't know, she should declare this a mistake and rewrite the 3rd book entirely. Really, it's that bad. It's not just because of the sad ending--  because, really, the book was so bad that by the end, they could have all died and I wouldn't have cared. I didn't even like the characters in this book.
B001U6YI92|4.0|This film has inspired countless filmmakers, most notably Quentin Tarantino. This is an epic and though sometimes it feels a little cheesy and dated, it's probably the best example of the Spaghetti Western genre and shows Clint Eastwood in his prime.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game is very addictive although it moves slow when it comes to making your village. I check on the animals just as much as my kids.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|In the past I ran a multiroom Logitech Squeezebox setup, with a 4TB NAS for all my music files. However, it was confusing to operate and needed to be completely rebuilt every 4 - 6 months when the receivers lost their network connectivity. Then, along came my new Google Chromecast and I can't believe how well Google have solved this problem.<br /><br />The setup is one of the easiest I have ever experienced for any electronic device, EVER. Seriously, it's that well though through.<br /><br />After plugging it in to the HDMI port on my stereo receiver, we now send music (from Google Play), YouTube videos, Movies, etc to it from a previously retired Android tablet that is now mounted on a cabinet door in the kitchen. My wife loves how easy it is to operate and how flawlessly it always just works.<br /><br />Frankly, I resent the fact that this is yet another area in my life that I am handing over to Google, but you cannot deny that they have come along into this entirely new market sector and just solved it so elegantly. Fantastic device.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />  1) I wish you could have multilple Chromecasts in multiple rooms and sync them.<br />  2) I wish you could cast a browser tab from an Android device like you can with a desktop chrome browser<br />  3) The number of services / apps that support Chromecast are currently small, but growing.<br /><br />For this kind of money, you really can't go wrong.
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|This is a return to form for Tom.  I do not understand why so many people are giving this 1 or 2 star reviews.  It is easily their best CD since Third Stage.  The Classic Boston sound is there...sure nothing rocks like Cool the Engines...Long Time...or....Smokin' but it is sure nice to hear some classic guitar for a change given what is called music these days.  If you are a Boston fan pick it up...

1484156005|5.0|Talented writer Christoph Fischer is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. \\"Sebastian\\" is the second book in the \\"Three Nations Trilogy\\" series. As with the other two fictional novels I've read and reviewed by him, I am totally mesmerized by the content of this one as well. I thoroughly enjoy this author's style, storyline, and subtle way of capturing the interest of his reading audience with a rich combination of historical fact and fiction intertwined in such a way to be both be very authentic and enthralling at the same time.<br /><br />In this novel...Sebastian Schreiber is a sixteen year old boy who develops a severe infection in his leg due to a simple accident. The lack of foresight on his part and his unwillingness to tell his mother about this mishap causes him much unforeseen grief. At his young age, his mother Vera is loath to have his leg amputated just below the knee but soon realizes that there is no other choice. After his surgery and upon his recuperation at home, the infection continues to fester and he is forced to face more surgery in order to now have his leg amputated above the knee. Although Sebastian is rather a frail boy and despite his surgery, he is determined to write his year end exams. With the coaching of his grandfather Oscar, he does extremely well. With the war looming, his father Franz is forced to go to battle leaving Sebastian and his mother to keep up the home front of both a demanding store and a frail family. They are only able to do this along with the assistance of hired help. Everyone involved during these difficult times works diligently in order to keep their livelihood safe.<br /><br />Each character is confronted with a variety of challenges...both physical and emotional. Oscar eventually succumbs to his weak heart and the family discovers that Franz is missing in action. Vera, Sebastian's mother still struggles with her own maladies but rises to the occasion with the assistance of her friends Theresa and Mathilde Glueck...would-be Freudian analysts. With the introduction of each new character...Eva, Luise, Margit and her mother Piroska, as well the kind librarian Gerlinde and several others, the reader is further drawn into the captivating story line as the plot enticingly unfolds.<br /><br />Author Christoph Fischer has such a gifted way with words that he is able to draw his reading audience right into the minds of his characters. I find myself totally captivated with this technique and very much enjoy being such an intimate part of the many twists and turns that take place in each of their lives. The history, the religious backgrounds, the lovely touch of romance, the wide cast of captivating characters...so expertly connected and effectively tied together is bound to attract the most discerning of readers.

B0055PGUYU|4.0|An extremely thought provoking work.  The author brought what could be dry research papers to life with his examples.  I now feel compelled to exam the habits in my life, family and business and determine the key ones to tackle. I highly recommend it.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|We have been long-time fans of The Piano Guys and this album is yet another great collection of music to add to their other albums. The music is inspiring and makes you want to dance all at the same time! And my daughter and now my son too both were totally calmed by their  music as babies!

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This was an amazing book! I count a book as true when I am a different person after reading it. That is the case with this book. I was sad when it ended.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I have never read a book like this before. It i full o suprises, a couple of gross parts but mostly fantasy. This book takes place in the future 129 years after word war 4 and when cars that run on gasoline r in musiums.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|There's no real way to write a quick review of this. It can get a little slow if you're playing with multiple newbies, but once everyone gets a hang of it the game doesn't get old because of the way the resources, ports, and player order change from game to game. Try playing the game online at playcatan.com to get used to the rules and strategies quickly. 5-6 player expansion is a bit much. Stick with 3 or 4-players! Awesome for anyone 10 and older.

B00H2D1XDQ|5.0|Awesome graphics and great Christmas songs also. I personally love these hidden object games in landscape so was happy to see another one with Phatpuppy art in this format. 21 levels and lots of different play options will keep you hunting for items for some time. Perfect way to get into the Christmas spirit in your down time!
1476733953|5.0|I'm not one to write book reviews but decided I needed to rate this one. The very beginning was a little slow and confusing but once the story unraveled and you pieced everything together it was mind blowing! This is a very good read and I am now working on Shift, which is volume 2 of this series.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have not read a novel by Stephen King since Misery. I am not really into horror movies OR books for that matter. I had forgotten about this book for awhile until the 50th anniversary of JFK's murder, and I saw the name of the book floating around the internet again. I jumped on the chance to read it. For one thing, I am fascinated with the concept of time travel..and also, with the events of that tragic day in Dallas. I was so taken by this book that I could not keep my nose out of it. About 99% of the time, I read only inspirational books..so the language in this one really put me off. But, one must consider that King really holds nothing back and some of these people may surely have used this kind of language if they were real people. As one who still remembers that horrific day and still tears up watching the Zapruder film..I was absorbed in this story. I have read where some people thought the book was too long, but I don't agree. I wish it had been longer as I did not want it to end. I really enjoyed the love story of Jake and Sadie and wished there was some way for them to stay together. But alas, Jake was a time traveler and it was not to be. It is interesting to read about how things might have turned out had this assassination not taken place. All in all, I really loved this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who can get past the language.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Loved the collection and the extra that were included......Definite must have for the Alien movie lover.....and the price was fantastic!
B004YOEFG8|5.0|This is a great version for collection. The quality is really great. I love this movie. I can watch it many times.

B00E9HML1Q|5.0|Amazing set. More special features that I ever expected, including, a continuation of the appendices from the Lord of the Rings. If you are a collector of the Weta figures as I am then this one won't disappoint. Highest quality and well worth every penny.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|if you are a fan of sailor moon you have to buy one of this dolls, she look exactly like sailor moon, the amount of money you pay for this item worth it
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|The amount of research Gladwell puts into this book is seriously impressive. He takes some sacred cows and forces you to look at them from profoundly different angles, but his writing style never sticks it in your face. I was disappointed when I got the end, didn't want that to be the last chapter.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Excellent character development and pace. Love this author! I am not yet finished but this is one of the best new authors for me I have seen in quite awhile!
6300182193|5.0|I purchased a collectable VHS copy that was recorded before the director ruined it by washing out all the colors that made the original so vibrant.<br />If that is important to you, check before buying.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Since My Kindle is on the nightstand, or what may be serving as a night stand, this app gets me up every morning.  To wake up it plays my own music stored on the Kindle and functions every bit like an expensive bed side alarm clock.  This bed side alarm clock goes everywhere with me though, from a tent high in Cascades, to a hotel room at the coast.  Thanks to this app I always have an alarm clock.<br /><br />One well thought out feature is that the snooze &#34;button&#34; is bigger that the &#34;dismiss&#34; button, so those half asleep mornings I can hit the button and go to snooze easily.  Also, the snooze setting can be adjusted to any length of time, something you can't do with an alarm clock.  You can wake up to a tone (there are several) or any music you want to load on your device.  This is the most used application on my Kindle!  (What can I say, I work for a living.)
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|One of the best Deadite films ever and now in crystal clear quality. While several other DVD sets have more features here and there you would have to buy multiple sets to get they all. This one contains the best selection of extras from all the other DVD sets. If you don't have this get it even if you own the DVDs like me.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|like a little bit different from the movie, well is the book so i should be better than the movie. I like this book because the cover photo wass nice, the plot is great.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|it works great.<br />es funktioniert wie es soll.<br />nice to have but i have to fill my comment now too for voting
B003CSV7TK|5.0|a classic! I loved this as a little girl and still love it as a Mommy. I rented it here on Amazon to be able to show my kids (3 and 6) and even though it's not a fast-paced story and is in the original black and white, they both enjoyed it and asked to watch it again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first book of this series and seeing the movie it was obvious that the second book would be just as good. I am not much of a reader and started &#34;Catching Fire&#34; several months ago. I got sidetracked and when I heard about the release of the second movie I told myself I needed to get through the Catching Fire. Having not read anything in several months I decided to start over. I began yesterday morning and finished it just now. It took me less than 24 hours of actual reading time to get through it. I was VERY IMPRESSED and pleased! I will likely go see the movie this weekend since. I have heard that it is even better than the first and just as good as the book!<br /><br />Bravo!!<br />Jeff
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie!  Loved the book, and for the first movie in the series, the producers did a good job of bringing the book to life.
B0000UJFCO|5.0|This is a well produced DVD & CD of an awesome YES Concert!  My husband and I enjoyed it so much that we actually found ourselves hooting & hollering & clapping as though we were at a live YES concert!  Although YES members are all virtuoso musicians, &  their songs are all masterpieces; the addition of the Symphony brings in even more dimension to their music. And, it is obvious that they all are really enjoying themselves, just as much as their audience is!  I'm sure you'll enjoy this concert too!
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|Love Rihanna. Love every song on the album. You go girl. Album after entertaining album she delivers something fresh yet familiar.
B000Z1LOBI|5.0|To get why Testament sounded like they did on the somewhat controversial “Demonic” album, you have to understand the state of music in 1997.  Testament came up as a thrash band in the vein of Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer, and others that had already established the genre.  They showed they were highly competent at this style with some phenomenal work on their first three albums.  Then they ran into two trends that forced thrash back underground, nearly killing it off altogether.  First, the grunge/alternative movement began, causing many metal fans and bands to head in that direction.  Second, death metal took thrash in the opposite extreme, finding an audience that wanted everything faster, heavier, and more brutal than thrash.  Testament was one of the many bands caught in the middle.<br /><br />After attempting two albums with a slightly more heavy rock feel, Testament couldn’t find any real success on MTV or the radio.  Then, on “Low”, they returned to their thrash roots and added in some then-new groove metal, only to be met with a great deal of indifference.  After this, they nearly fell apart.  Only Chuck Billy and Eric Peterson remained in the band, and they briefly considered changing the name.  They had penned what was basically a death metal song on “Low” called “Dog Faced Gods” that was earning them praise from that quarter, and since their core fanbase seemed to have eroded by the decline in thrash’s popularity, they struck while the iron was hot.  After scrapping the idea of changing the band name to Dog Faced Gods, Billy and Peterson assembled an impressive group featuring Gene Hoglan on drums and former Forbidden guitarist Glen Alvelais on second guitar and released “Demonic” as Testament.<br /><br />The album has an instantly noticeable death metal sound, punctuated by Chuck Billy’s all-out roaring vocal style that he’d used on “Dog Faced Gods”.  Upon hearing this, some older fans shunned the album, calling it a “trend-hop” and an attempt to “sell-out” given that death metal was more popular than thrash at the time.  This short-sighted assessment ignores all of the factors that went into their short-lived genre-jump, and it also neglects the fact that not all of “Demonic” falls under the category of death metal.  Songs like “The Burning Times” and “Jun-Jun” could have appeared on any one of Testament’s prior albums despite the death vocals, and the songs “John Doe” and “Hatreds Rise” see Billy using his traditionally gruff singing delivery almost exclusively.  If you’re a fan of Testament’s early work, don’t let yourself be deterred by the negative criticism that sometimes surfaces for “Demonic”.  It’s a fantastic, yet admittedly brutal, outing by a legendary band that has some of their best material.  Five stars all day.“sell-out” given that death metal was more popular than thrash at the time.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm a 52 year old female who usually plays word games, however this is<br />fun. It moves along at my pace but the game is timed, so don't waste time. It requires thought but not concentration like some word games. It's fun.
B00C74SHRK|3.0|This book is disappointing. Not a page turner my any imagination. It wafts. It's side bars are way too long. However the only thing that kept me reading is that the characters implored  you to. I would normally finish a book this big in half the time but I kept having to push myself into returning to it.  Out of respect to the author for her famous best seller I preserved. It wasn't terrible it was just way too wordy. The editor should be shot.<br />If you only read one book a month/year this is not it.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I enjoyed the book and how it related to WWII. A VERY WELL TOLD STORY. I would recommend to a friend.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I have only played 17 or so games. It's like another ap game I played until I maxed out the free parts. It helps me relax my mind to sleep. I lety niece play it. She's 10 and it challenges her.

B008NB0SQO|5.0|Commentary is hilarious. Just a classic Muppet movie. Directed by Brian Henson. He definitely takes after his dad and knows what he's doing. GREAT holiday family movie.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|Well written  and engrossing  from beginning to end.  I hope that the movie will do it justice.  War is hell.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|I was raised with this amazing film. To this day, it remains my own little holiday secret, and I cant wait to share it with my nieces in a few years. If you havent seen this, you really should. The production is simply gorgeous-- no detail was too small, and it really did create another world for me as a child.
B008ACC9CM|4.0|I love Charlotte & Jonathan and the music they sing on this album.  I especially love when both are miked equally and singing harmonies.<br /><br />That being said, this production (the mixing and arrangements) is especially lacking.  As has been said, the choirs are too loud at times; on the first song, the only word that comes to mind for the mixing job involving the choir is &#34;brash.&#34;  I know that Jonathan has a stupendous voice, but my biggest frustration is with the fact that Charlotte has been mixed almost into the background at times (which does not have to happen).  It's almost like Jonathan is singing alone with an overly loud choir and/or orchestra.<br /><br />I'm looking for J & C to capitalize on their individual and combined strengths.....in creative ways. Like when they sing &#34;The Prayer&#34; without choir, and Charlotte's abilities are on more of an equal footing with Jonathan's huge voice.  To my mind, that's what makes &#34;Jonathan & Charlotte.&#34;  I would suggest that spending time with Sarah Brightman (if that is indeed possible) may be a very important step in their career.  She has to be one of the more creative/successful singers on the pop and classical world stage and I believe she definitely could help them develop their uniqueness.  (Personally, I don't think Simon Cowell is the creative mind to help two teenagers.)<br /><br />All that said, I still watch them on BGT You Tube, still listening to this cd..... and I am waiting for their 2nd cd to arrive right now.  (And I still love you, Simon.)
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|What can I say - I LOVE these guys! Not only are they musically impressive, but the creativity in their arrangements and in their tremendously entertaining videos is off the charts. It's completely obvious that they absolutely love what they do. I constantly recommend their videos and CDs to anyone who will listen. If you're looking for quality music that isn't run-of-the-mill, you've just found it.
B001E45XT4|4.0|Bought to replace the same exact headset which broke after years of use.<br /><br />Packaging had obviously been opened - it appears to have been previously returned which makes me a bit nervous.  Would have preferred a new, unopened headset but all appears to be working...
B001B51B9M|5.0|We used to watch this on VHS when visiting my grandma in NY -- like every time. It's a CLASSIC. Robert Preston and Shirley Jones are the BEST! Buddy Hackett is hilarious. The whole cast is tremendous.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Frankly, it was a much better story than we expected. There were many major stars in the production as well.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an excellent read! I read it and just could not put it down until I was finished. There were parts that were literally laugh out loud funny and parts that were so interesting and compelling that I just had to read to my hubby with no context and he seemed to enjoy it (lol). I thought this book was brilliant and I am so excited that they are coming out with a movie! Yay Ben Affleck!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|great options!  perfect for creating background noise for nap time, adult or child.  remembers you last settings, there are A LOT of options.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I liked it much better than &#34;eat, pray, love&#34; which is a similar sort of story--the transformation of a broken woman into a more whole person.  The pieces that I really liked focused more on her actual journey (not her emotional journey) and how she felt making the trip alone.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Figure looks great!  The faces were a<br />Little hard to change out at first but that was the only hard part.  Can't wait for Mercury to come out.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|I am not a professional critique but i love this album.  It is surprisingly heavy and very well put together.
B00E00P5JC|5.0|Excellent image quality. Entertaining story and child-friendly. A classic underdog tale that is easy for children to follow and teaches a few morals along the way.
B0093Q9Y7W|4.0|Great story and the cast was all star.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a Robert De Niro fan.
B009JZTOG8|2.0|2nd season hasn't been my favorite. 1st season was awesome, and thankfully the 3rd season is good again! Keep this awesomeness going.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The deluxe edition is spectacular. The Piano Guys weave their talent and creativity to create fresh takes on Christmas classics. From serene to peppy, this CD has it all. The videos on the DVD are enjoyable, and I cannot wait to play the Yule Log while my family unwraps Christmas presents on the 25th. Make sure to add the joy of A Family Christmas to your holiday!

B00DMK6WN4|1.0|Not a good movie at all. Save your $ for when it goes onsale for $3.99. My 6 yr old did not even like it. Way over priced and over rated. Sorry, just my opinion.
B008MM9630|5.0|Nice game fun pretty easy to complete all of the goals good game for young children and adults as well like that you can change your avitar
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've read all of Stephen King's books and found this to be one of the most satisfying and suspenseful novels I've read this year.
0810970686|5.0|I bought the entire series for my kids.  They all read them (ages 10, 12 and 14) and they really liked them.  If it keeps my children's interest long enough for them to read an entire series, I'm happy.
B00GTZJLAK|5.0|It was great kids loved it they watched it several times I highly recommend it. I would purchase this for children  3-12 years of age.  As an adult it was great too.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Loveeeeee this movie! I can't get enough of the minions :) This is honestly a great movie for any age.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Just discovered Joe this year on Palladia and was blown away!  This concert at the Beacon theatre is outstanding in every way.  I cannot believe I never heard of him before, but music does not reach us the way it did years ago, over the radio.
B00F35BV64|2.0|So, the LOW ratings I have seen are over some silly content/pricing issues over the DVD/Blu-Ray buys. BUT Absolutely No mention for those who are &#34;Loyal&#34; TRUE Fans of the Original series in which JJ Abrams should be honoring but he has &#34;No Honor or Respect&#34; for the original characters. JJ Abrams' failure is for following reasons. 1. The Romantic relationship between Ahura and Spock is &#34;Ridiculous&#34; and Goes against the original series and the characters authenticity. JJ Abrams Should be Ashamed of taking a Classic and Lowering it to some &#34;cheap Hollywood romance crap&#34;. Please: Kill that relationship! 2. This movie is about Kahn??? seriously WHY? The original movie of Kahn was done beautifully and realistically!! He uses a Anglo-Saxon White guy play a famous Mongolian? LOL! Why Fix or Re-write something that is NOT Broken?? Is JJ Abrams out of IDEAS &#34;? Disgusted! However, in general, I love all the characters and his ability to fill some pretty BIG shoes but please JJ Abrams: 'you insult our original STAR TREK characters&#34; by making into something they were never meant to be!! He needs to stop destroying what makes them so unique to begin with!! So many flaws with this movie and the first one is also heart-breaking.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Have had a lot of fun playing this game. The story is really told well. Can be humorous which makes it more fun. Not many HO mostly point and click. Has an excellent map so you know where to go. also it shows if there is something special to do there. Don't need a guide which is nice. You can skip puzzles but most of them you can figure out. The game is challenging but not too hard that you want to give up. I highly recommend this game.
0062059963|4.0|Overall I really enjoyed The Elite. Whilst not as good as The Selection it was a good continuation to the series and this is developing into a great, romance based dystopian trilogy. America is incredibly fickle and because she is such a smart girl it made it slightly annoying to see her umming and ahhing over who she loves more and ignoring the more important things at times. However, I do actually enjoy the romance in this book and the love triangle is well done. I know who I am rooting for though both guys are incredible.<br /><br />What I want now is to see this story evolve beyond the romance. There are some great dystopian elements that have been kept in the background so far that I really hope book 3 will bring us more of. I think this series would be even better if there was more of the rebellion and America’s powerful personality to balance out the more trivial “which guy should I choose?” elements.<br /><br />*I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review, this has not affected my opinions or rating in any way*
B00BEIYN3M|3.0|Was surprised by certain parts of this... Seeing the kid's junk was not what I was expecting to see. Not for young kids!!<br />Jennifer Aniston, while I find the stripper image difficult to accept she does do a good job in this film. Still looks great too!<br />All of the cast do a great job.. the story line as you would expect is far fetched but might be better as a rental or free download..
B00GX50BD2|4.0|I thought this was an excellent movie. A bit longer than I had thought it would be, but it really caught my attention. Must see.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|I liked &#34;Pan's Labyrinth&#34; and &#34;Hellboy&#34; but this excretion by del Toro is the worst sell out and the worst movie ever made.  Bad acting, bad direction and worst of all, bad editing, make this a stupid, stupid, stupid...
B005ZB91KY|3.0|Average movie, nothing special, great time killer.<br />If you like this genre then you wont be dissapointed as it falls into the Avenger complete storyline, chronologically.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|First book I read on my Kindle. Easy reading and kept you interested in the story until the very end.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is such a great item to buy if you find yourself watching Netflix and you tube a lot. Perfect for the whole family and great for parties because you can use Pandora.
B00FLDG5BE|2.0|I own all of the previous Crossroads dvd's and find that this is my least favorite. The recording of this is much more slick in that it appears to have been staged so that it could be filmed better than the others. Not what I was looking for.....while all of the musicians perform well and the sound is good for me it lacks the concert feel. Perhaps it's the venue. Eric Clapton is of course doing a great job playing the music and supporting the other musicians but the music on this dvd is different. Hard to put my finger on what there is about this video that seems less than the others.... Gotta wonder why Doyle Brahmhall is trying to look like Robert Brady. Someone should probably talk to him about the hair and clothes..<br />Sonny Landreth is awesome as usual and Booker T and the MG's.... well ya gotta love that part of the show. Green Onions, Time is Tight........very well done!<br />This is well recorded and the video is very good. The music........well....ymmv.<br /><br />Maybe you will enjoy it more than I!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What an amazing series! I really hope the author revisits the book from Christians POV I would read all 3 again just to hear it from him! YUMMY!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|great graphics and many levels. i enjoyed the timing challenge as well as the hint function. i highly recommend this game.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Absolutely one of the best movies ever!!! Would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a heart .I loved it.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Incredible band. Love love love this album. Worth every penny. A great fusion of music styles with intelligent, haunting and powerful lyrics
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is the best thing that happened to me I love it and the multi player is awesome. Get the game. When you do get sniper it rocks.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|my head just kept spinning and the pages just kept turning!<br />I hope the cable series stays around long enough to get here
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|A lovely movie that is about making family (in this case about one that wasn't too whole) The tone ranges from serious/ somber to the lightly/ funny.  The setting of Hawaii is an added bonus.
B005EIS5IW|5.0|Yasmine gets it. This author captures the essence of what makes cat people crazy — and I can say that because I'm practically certifiable.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Really good movie, but Zombie movies are starting to loose there charm. But worth the while anyway. Good performances by all the cast.
B008B68IUY|5.0|I got this for my nieces for Christmas. I know they will love it. Got it a great price also.
B002U3CCBK|3.0|I really enjoyed the first half of the book, but then it sort of fizzled out.  Everything was tied up neatly by the end of the book, I just felt let down and I'm not sure why.<br /><br />All the characters were well written and you could imagine them quite clearly; The character of sheik was delightful - a person you might want in your life.  I have met scientists like our unlikely hero. The PM his spin master were straight out of Yes Prime Minister.<br /><br />There was so much I liked about the book, that I can't quite put my finger on why it left me flat in the last half.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to people who have had to deal with scientists or politicians because these characters are quite recognisable. Anyone who is after an easy read.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Nice read but character development was light.  While I did not expect &#34;deep&#34; development I would have liked a bit more than surface introductions to Portia or Ancil.  I think the unknown history (or other character) of Lettie could have been introduced sooner.<br /><br />As a long-time reader of Grisham this makes for an OK couple of days reading.....
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|My daughter is eight yrs old and she likes this game...then it caught my eye and now I like the game.. very entertaining for her.. very entertaining for me.. LOL..
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|Love it. Great show. The actors are fantastic. I wish the sticker in the front was place on the other side.
0307271080|5.0|Excellent book on identity, immigration and race. Couldn't drop the book. Very insightful into human relations and a great challenge to stereotypes.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|The story was good, and it was nice to hear the WWII story from the point of view of German children.  The &#34;chatty Mr. Death&#34; was a distraction which I just read to try to finish with so I could get back to the &#34;real&#34; story.  Sorry author Markus, it is good to try new things in art, but sometimes they just don't work as well as we thought.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved this book.  It was light hearted entertainment.  I really enjoyed the characters and I sped through the book.<br /><br />I'm not sure it would be everyone's cup of tea.  One lady at our book club couldn't stand the main character, but I found him delightful, so it just goes to show that one person's pleasure is another's pain.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to quite a lot of my family and friends.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Very entertaining. My family and I enjoyed this movie very much so. We all thought it was so much fun.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like it, my daughter loves it.. she makes me laugh when she shots the ball at the wrong spot.. overall it's a good game.. needs life (hearts) to come a little faster.. why we can't watch videos to gain more life....<br />Just  thought...
B00D56GJCE|4.0|Her performance is why everyone should check this out. Rest of the show is above average but has some major holes, (what cop wouldn't ask about security footage when someone jumps in front of a train at the station?) but the originality makes up for it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved the Wool series! I can't wait to start on the next! This will be a movie for sure!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|As usual, Donna Tartt doesn't disappoint the reader.  She goes to unusual places in the minds of her subjects, and you're never quite sure where she's taking you.  She's an excellent writer.
B0029VUV70|5.0|The Reader is a superb story, thoughtful and intelligently portrayed.  Earlier reviews have done a great job in explaining the story and emotional impact.  It is a masterpiece of film.
B003E88TKS|4.0|Eh... it's a good movie, but you shouldn't watch it if you recently got out of a relationship and still have lingering feelings. lol
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game is okay it just has a delayed loading time while playing the game it gets annoying some times
B000A7DVRC|5.0|The Big Lebowski.  Do I really need to summarize this film?  It's a cult classic!  Anyway, buy it, you will like it.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|This app blows, it's very unrealistic and WAY to repetitive and you need money to keep playing for more then 15 minutes. The only reason why I gave it two stars because it's only fun for 2 missions. Nice job Glu
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Allow me to catch my breath because this version of Jane Eyre completely blew me away in the most fantastic way. When I was a teenager the 1996 version of Jane Eyre was one of my favorite films. When the Mia Wasikowska version came out I saw that one and thought it was quietly gorgeous and beautifully shot. Recently, I came across this version and immediately went out and bought it not quite sure if it was going to measure up. Oh, Goodness, I could not have been more off the mark in thinking that this version would be anything less than AMAZING. This is by far my favorite version.<br /><br />Through the many remakes of Jane Eyre most people know the story. I won't bore you with the plot details of which you are probably quite aware. Let's start with what is different about this version. The first thing I noticed is that not much time at all is given to Jane's childhood struggles. This may bother some people but I was actually okay with it. Very quickly the viewer is thrown into the meat of the story; Jane, her time at Thornfield Hall, and Mr. Rochester. That's what I wanted to see and get lost in and this version showered me with exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was the strong chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens are perfect together. They are passionate, playful, and electric while still being somewhat restrained. Toby Stephens plays a Mr. Rochester who, though he is gruff and maybe a little mean at times, is also so obviously in love. The way he finds ways to be around Jane, whether to talk to her or simply be in the same room with her, made me swoon. He loves Jane and the viewer starts to see that he is doing things to try and figure out if Jane cares for him. The scene with the fortune teller shows just how much Rochester NEEDS to know if Jane loves him.<br /><br />Ruth Wilson is the best Jane Eyre I've yet to see. There's a stubborn fire underneath all of that quietness. While many might see her asplain I thought she had a serene beauty that came from inside. She banters with Mr. Rochester and doesn't let him intimidate her even when she doesn't understand his motives. Just like Rochester, Jane is so obviously in love but has no idea what Rochester feels. Part of her serenity and strength though is that she loves very quietly, and fully. A perfect example of how she loves is when she begins wearing the red cloth around her neck. It was subtle but very deep.<br /><br />The kiss(es). Oh, boy, the kisses just KILLED me and it was a beautiful death. Passion, passion, passion. This version has passion and it is grand. I saw it meantioned in another review that there is quite a bit of kissing and I wasn't sure how I would feel about that. It's done well and I would not love this version as much as I do if the affection was absent.<br /><br />All in all? If you can't tell from this gushing review, i think saying that I love this miniseries is a gross understatement. I watched it twice back to back and then watched it the next day. I could not get enough. Grand.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Love Iron man movies! This one was worth watching. Amazon price matched this item for me and I was refunded three cents! LOL
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, a Candy Crush Saga for Kindle!<br /><br />Don't start playing this. Much addiction, frustration, elation, and yelling at your Kindle/phone/computer/iPad/etc. will ensue.
B00FQMVCEA|5.0|This movie is so awesome just like all the kids movies. They are a joy to watch.  Buy them all.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|At first it seems this book is &#34;sparingly&#34; written, not &#34;wordy&#34;.  But on reflection every word is perfect.  There is not one extraneous word.  Perfectly written to tell a powerful story.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|The animation is nice great game for for my grandchildren, although I'm enjoying playing this game now.  It has already become a bit addicting.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Everyday I find something new that this does. It is a awesome piece of equipment that self charges and a nice size that you don't lose it but also not to big that it is a hassle to take around with you.
B00DXLO0D6|4.0|I'm assuming by me writing anything in here and someone actually reading it is pointless. If you haven't seen the show you wouldn't most likely be buying it. What's not to like about a hot chick in a genie costume? The shows and story line is pretty good and if you like a little bit of the fantasy world you will enjoy this. Its the complete entire series of I dream of Jeannie.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|This app. is great. Easy to use, and has a variety of sounds so you can compose your own white noise. I use it to help our baby sleep.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Another great movie.  I enjoy all the childrens movies.  I will continue to buy.  Big kid at heart.  So good
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Hard to put down. Fast paced thriller that keeps you turning the pages. A master of story telling, great book.
B005DOKL3E|3.0|I didn't really care for this one and I gave it to a friend.  I just needed a different type.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting and a fun brain teaser. There is some awesome levels that really challenge your brain.<br />Great overall app.
B00FLDG5BE|2.0|I agree with others about the out of sync of this blue ray, I first purchased this on dvd, but was driven crazy by the out of sync soundtrack that I returned the dvd and replaced it with the blueray version only to be treated with the same crap,i have all the other crossroads concerts,and all are far superior in sound+picture quality,rhino should do a recall on this dvd-blueray,and fix the problem as the concert itself deserves better.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have tired 5 or 6 different keyboards and I keep coming back to SwiftKey. I use Flow and type normally depending upon how much I need to type. There are a few small things that other keyboards do better, but SwiftKey is the all around front runner.
B006P4FBUE|1.0|Its not  as good as those real grand pianos, but its ok. I don't really like it  but i play the piano and this was the best-selling, cause you get thirty coins with your purchase!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Game is fun but addictive.  As you get further in the game puzzles get harder to get through, unless. You buy extra moves and other help.  Little depends on skill.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Good book for anyone looking to change their own reality.This book changed the way I look at life!Great book and easy read.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Man, this was not good! The human-ness of Superman was completely unrealized in this movie, which is what make Superman cool. I guess the destruction was alright, but that's not what makes a movie to me. Completely bummed =(
0399171541|5.0|It took me a while but I finally sat down (actually laid down in bed) and recently finished reading Morrissey's Autobiography.<br />It is unbelievably good. He is just crazily and lovingly verbose - but also impossibly vindictive and childishly petty... yet his life story is still a pleasure to read. Such a wit. Only he could write something even remotely like it. Nothing compares. Chapters? No need for that. Editing? What for? A writing style completely all his own. Of course.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Thank you for a well-written series.  The third book did a great job of finishing the journey.  I really enjoyed the development of the characters in all three books.  Tris and Tobias were great protagonists.  The fact that the author explored the flaws in the ideologies and in the individuals within her story made this an incredible adventure.
1416972242|5.0|This series is seriously amazing. I regret not picking up on this series earlier but, better late than never. Cassandra Clare really did an amazing job, she kept me on the edge if my seat with this book and left me wondering what would happen next. I love the plot and characters. If you are the type of reader who likes magic, supernatural, and romance then this book is definitely for you. I cannot wait to read the rest of this series.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|My daughter LOVES the My Little Pony series, and this movie doesn't disappoint!  Even my seven year old son enjoys watching it!
0399536108|5.0|This is a book that will make you think.If you feel like you are trapped in a job somewhere with no perceived options then give this book a read.Interesting book!
B00EIBO8T6|5.0|This movie is truly one of my favorite romantic movies of all time. It's perfect and I believe everyone should have seen it! It's such a mix of emotions and the music is just superb! Amazing!
B00GX598FO|5.0|Watched in instant video  excelent colore's and sound through. a Samsung Sound Bar. Lots of action and drama kept me interested with a 5 Star cast that. Was perfect with this action packed thriller
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Awesome product. I use this for my online gaming daily and it holds up perfectly.  I have had this going on6months now and it's gone above and beyond my expectations.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|awesome sad but very good.can't wait for the movie. ready for more from this author. katnisss is one to look up to
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Awesome Bond. Awesome movie. Full of action, hot chicks, extreme violence, and crazy villain. Everything you could want in a bond movie.
B000002VMH|5.0|I have been searching for it and couldnt find it. My husband loves it. We listen to it all the time.
B000FCK65W|5.0|An iconic story about growing up in Brooklyn NY at the turn of the century  amidst poverty and hope.  A difficult family story but a triumphant one.
B00G6MW68K|5.0|I'm looking for the Blu-Ray.<br />I find it somewhat confusing that this is called the Blu-Ray/CD and sells for $14.99. That's more like a CD price, and indeed it is described as (Audio) here.<br />On the Muse web, they want  £17.99 = $29.54 for the BD/CD. That's a more realistic price.. but it's probably PAL.. it doesn't say.<br /><br />Does anyone know what you're getting for $14.99 on this site?<br /><br />There is a $50.00 listing, on this site, but that seems extreme... or more like MADNESS !<br /><br />Thanks.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|Entertaining but somewhat predictable. Nice ACTION movie.<br /><br />Robots and sea monsters were very well done!<br /><br />Never a dull minute from beginning to end.
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|Received a message telling me that I have reached my limit on viewing 50 books, I had already downloaded approximately 10 books which have been good reads and now I cannot access anymore unless I download the pro app. Disappointing!!!
B008JFUPK8|4.0|For this review I'm sticking to the technical aspects of the Blu-Ray. Due the the polarizing nature of this film my opinion on the story or acting of this film is pointless. First I'd like to comment on the picture quality,  which is quite good. I noticed a lot of smaller details I missed in the theatre, especially in the Krypton scenes. The sound mix is good also. The score is really fantastic, all the other noises like spaceships and explosions don't drown out the dialogue. My gripe with this set is the special features. I thought there would be more. The big one is like a video commentary. I didn't care for it. It's sort of half way between a commentary and a documentary. I like how I can still sort of watch a film with the commentary going, you can't really do that here because the screen is some times split in two or three smaller screens with the film, documentary footage and interview all going at the same time... It was distracting. There are a few other features that were interesting. There is a DVD and ultraviolet copy also.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I  LOVE Katy Perry! Cant wait to see her in her next concert! More great songs and hits on this CD!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Im fully addicted. I leave and still come back for more. Its a great game and im so happy to have it on my kindle now.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|Allmans - awesome! Gary Clarke Jr - never heard of him before this - the new Hendrix !  BB King - yeah baby
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|I am a fan of the Reacher series and I felt that, while Cruise did a great acting job, there was a great departure from the written character.<br /><br />Someone who has not read the books would no doubt really like the movie!<br /><br />As an avid fan of the books I was a bit let down. The movie followed the script of the book well---Tom Cruise just ISN'T Jack Reacher.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is amazing. Have a super size suitable for the camera and all accessories. The material is great quality and very pretty!
B00E9PMMX0|4.0|I love the films. Picture and sound are good. Only episode IV shows some age. The commentary tracks are very informative. I knocked one star off for the \\"changes\\" made to the films. While some are cool additions others felt unnecessary.
B000002TLX|5.0|I have loved Richard since the 80's. I saw him in concert and he was funny, charming and humble. I love his voice
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addictive game of chance.  400+ levels all by luck.  Requires no skill but does require friends to help you out! It messed with my eyesight so I quit playing it.
B00D6B4PUG|2.0|Often times I can't reply to emails, which is not a good thing for a download on a kindle, reduces what I can do on it.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|Good for a zombie movie. They are not my favourite genre when it comes to movies but a good job was done here.<br />Although the movie was somewhat predictable (what movie isn't really?) it was entertaining and at the end I felt it was money well spent,
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is really good. Of course it's different than the movie but,it's a really good version. It keeps you interested and wanting to read more. I recommend it to people who like the movie.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|That's my Boys! Loved hearing all their old songs at this summers concert but like the new songs also. They still got it!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I thought it was a great book about a great life!  I wish Anthony Keidis would write another one on the years since then.  All I can say is....read this book!  Very interesting...you won't be disappointed! Once I started reading it, I could not put it down until the end.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Oh what I didn't know!  After a class in nutrition 50 years ago and tutoring in a health study 20 years ago, I thought I knew something.  But this is practical science from a man who has spent his life studying health.  You may not have all or any of the health issues he's addressing, but you will learn a lot.
B003B02O0A|5.0|My favourite John Grisham book.<br />Well written and accurate to the attitudes in the South during that time period.<br />Strong characters and a believable plot!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|More than a file explorer, it's an app manager, task manager and basic multimedia viewer in one. Found it in the tablet and also put it on my phone.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|SYCAMORE ROW IS A GREAT READ AND TIES UP ALOT OF LOOSE ENDS OF PREVIOUS NOVELS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANY GRISHAM BOOK. HE HAS A KNACK FOR MAKING YOU FEEL YOU ARE THERE.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|A NAUGHTY ROMP.  THESE TWO HAVE A GREAT CHEMISTRY ON SCREEN.  I HAVE WATCHED IT SEVERAL TIMES.  LOVE JUSTIN AND MILA TOGETHER...
0307719227|5.0|This is a really ambitious book. It present a very compelling economical and political theory and provides a wealth of fascinating supporting historical evidence the theory from different centuries and most continents.  I was aware of some of these historical details, but having them explained with the book's main theory creates an important new perspective.  The core argument that ties individual and property rights to sustainable economic growth is fascinating.  While the book touch upon historical development in Africa and Asia, I thought that the strongest evidence are from Europe (particularly England) and the former European colonies.
0399157573|4.0|Much better read than the last offering (Red Mist).<br />There was a return to the actual forensics side which appealed to me and attracted me to the Scarpetta series initially.<br />Less family feuding and emotional dysfunction as there was in Red Mist--which is the only Cornwell book I remember ever giving a negative rating .<br />The coroner/autopsy evidence finding Kay has always been my hero and DUST brought her back.<br /><br />Thank you Ms. Cornwell!
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|I rented this from Amazon prime (PS3 AP) and it said it was 5.1 Dolby. Don’t be fooled, it is 2.0. It sounded ridiculous on my amazing sound system. I use Netflix every day and it comes in beautiful 5.1 surround sound. Please figure it out Amazon. You can’t say one thing and deliver another.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|not as much fun as I thought.  Little challenge.  Good for young kids or starters to playing games.  Sound is good
B005LAIGSM|5.0|SWEET, SAD, FRUSTRATING.  ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES.  I TOOK A CHANCE AND BOUGHT IT WITHOUT RENTING IT FIRST.  I AM SO GLAD IT DID.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app, no junk just weather. Better than any other weather app I  have used. Thank you creators of accuwesther!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Terrible movie.  I could have watched the<br />Walking Dead.  Terrible and not believable ending.<br />Not worth watching.  Why all the wording required?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This author is a master story teller. He weaves lives of family members across generations as they come springing to life. The reader gets pulled into their emotions, their past, their future. It is a wonderful journey about family, heartache, love and tragedy.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Kinda confusing.  Not sure what the fuss is about this game.  Sound is good and colors are nice.  Would not purchase any extras.
0061765236|5.0|I HAVE READ APPROXIMATELY 12 JODI PICOULT BOOKS. SHE NEVER DISAPPOINTS!  I WOULD RECOMMEND ANY BOOK MS. PICOULT HAS WRITTEN.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Who would have guessed the ending.  Those times were an ugly time in the history of the USA.  Grisham handled it well.  I sure hope we never see those times again.  I did not like the way the lawyers treated Lettie.  But, I understand the times were like that.  This book brought out anger, frustration, sadness, utter contempt that one person can treat another person so awful, and tears for all parties.  Kudos for the Judge's wisdom to pacify all parties fairly and squarely.  One of Grisham's finest works.  Thank you John.  I couldn't put the book down.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Love the revised scriptures with use of other translations included.  Another wonderful translation to make bible reading enjoyable and understandable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was nice to be able to re-read and still be surprised by the excellent story telling skills. Looking forward to the movies!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|If you like hidden object games then you will really like this game.  I play mine every day and look forward to having the energy restored so I can play more.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I CAN'T EVEN SAY WHY I LIKE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH BUT I HAVE WATCHED IT THREE TIMES.  LOVE  MERYL STREEPS ACTING.  SHE IS AMAZING AS JULIA CHILDS.  I COLLECT AMY ADAMS MOVIES.
B009O2XY12|4.0|It's a very fun game and I like it a lot. The only thing that stinks is that the app requires wifi but otherwise I love it.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Everyone I know who has any other app store has already gotten two updates and I haven't even gotten the first update. Doesn't seem right.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|We pre-ordered the CD/DVD Christmas set.  We were so excited when it finally arrived.  As usual, The Piano Guys are awesome and take Christmas music to a whole new level.  This is definitely our best Christmas CD ever.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game.  It is very addicting!  When I start playing I do not want to quit and get nothing else done!  Would highly recommend !
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Refreshing and a little different. Entire cast was excellent. The central mystery was handled and thought out well. Kept my rapt attention all the wat through.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is my first review of a Kindle Fire HD game this game is super fun.You should try it out yourself the control s are simple.But the game is a totally different story. This game is too good to be a free game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Downloaded this game out of boredom but ended up loving it. Very addicting. Levels are challenging enough to keep me interested but easy enough that I don't get aggravated with being stuck on a level forever.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This is a very good read!  It's good enough that you don't want to put it down.  Highly reccommend it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Honestly this game is epic you can choose people and buy the people you want to use and if you sign in you can get certain people.
B003JTHXN6|4.0|Overall, this book was inspiring and interesting, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in business or entrepreneurship.<br /><br />BUT...towards the end of the book, it felt like one long advertisement for Zappos.  The last few chapters seemed to be exclusively devoted to singing the Zappos praises!  While I know Tony Hsieh, the author, is the CEO of the company, and I would expect him to write positively about the business...I felt it was a little much...
B0064W65SO|5.0|Flawless, original, classic; there's a reason Miller is the man he is. if you need a starting point for comic reading, this is the first stop. it always boils the blood for more.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Really loving the game until update.. now I can't play cause there is no update available for kindle fire... now I'm just upset.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I usually find it hard to put a Grisham book down, however, the plot dragged on and on.  I found myself wishing he would just get to the point of the plot and move on. This is not his best work...
B00B7Y0206|2.0|It doesn't has the option for &#34;PAIRing&#34; the devices which is difficult if i want to share my video to my smart tv.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Dylan's well-worn scratchy voice actually brings a certain world-weariness to these songs, as if he's seen and done it all and now just wants to spend a peaceful Christmas with his family.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is worth reading just for the exciting twist. It kept me guessing and it was at times eerie and creepy so for me it delivered as a thriller. I was telling my mom all about it and we were trying to guess who the killer was and what happened to the girl, which proves it is an exciting book because I wanted to share it with others.<br /><br />The other thing I like about this book is that it is clearly a post-feminist work. If you want an interesting female character who has her own ideas and opinions about the world, she is here. She brings up some scary ideas that made me question things about my own life. Although I don't like this character and I still think she is wrong she really challenges your ideas about boyfriends, loyalty to your parents and your own behavior (if you are a woman.) This book isn't all murder mystery fluff; it will make you think.<br /><br />(I read a few reviews before I bought it so I'll put in my two cents about the ending.) When I finished this book I got the feeling that the last 20% was rushed. I think the author may have got bored with the story and just wanted to wrap it up. It doesn't have a terrific ending because some of the characters have almost pacified reactions to the final events. It kind of cuts the legs out from under the whole premise. SPOILERS MAYBE *******But, in a way I think the author knew she would end the book like that, because although the idea you are left with is unrealistic for the extreme events that happened in the story, the message and the questionable decisions of the characters makes you think about relationships and how people make them work, even when it might be a bad idea.**********END MAYBE SPOILERS Anyway! In the author's note she said thanks her editor for encouraging her when she was 82.5% done, or something like that. So....called it! She struggled to the finish line with this book, and even if she didn't take first place she still ran the race in good time.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|absolutely detailed background to Queen and their up and down career. This when viewed alongside The Great Pretender balances the story
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I loved this CD.  However, as is common with Lady Gaga, you either love her or you'll hate her.  This CD is definitely geared more toward her current fans than it is to attracting new ones.  That said there are some great beats and her vocals are out of this world.  Can't wait to hear this in the club!
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|Just from the video, it looks AWESOME!! If it looks like that, then i will give this a 120% of Awesomeness. AND I ALREADY DID GIVE IT 120%!!!
B00FATEJYE|1.0|Every time my kindle shuts down it rest the whole download and I have to wait two hours to at lea as t to be almost done
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|This album is a classic. This is some of the best music ever made! Bob Marley has a way of putting his heart into the music and you can really feel it.
B000M39HB8|5.0|One of the best movies ever...... The music is timeless and Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire make us remember what true gentlemen they were.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Bought the CD because it was so cheap and heard it was really good.  I can confirm what my friends told me.  This is one of the best albums of the year.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So easy to set up and use. Love the convenience of being able to stream to my TV from my phone/computer without having to hook up cables. I am hoping to be able to use Chromecast for more than Netflix streaming, etc.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved it!  Couldn't stop reading it.  I especially liked that it was a continuance of another of Grisham's books.  I would definitely recommend it to others.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I liked the book so much that I read four more of Orson Scott Card's wonderful books in this series.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|Loved this game. I finished it in just a couple of days. Loved the graphics and the gameplay. I had to think about some of the puzzles, which was great. The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it was longer. Now I've finished it and I want more!
B00C7GY8Y4|4.0|I purchased this CD because she was performing a show that I wanted to attend.  Unfortunately I was unable to make it the the performance, which is a real shame because as good as the CD is, her voice live is what is truly amazing.  All the editing on the songs takes away from her sultry voice.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Okay, to start, this is an incredible book, or &#34;books&#34;. I can not describe how great this book is and I would certainly have missed out on a great and incredible story had I skipped this.<br /><br />The beginning of the book, is very slow and can be a put off, BUT if you get past that very start you will not want to stop.<br /><br />This should not be passed by, I would be almost willing to bet you will love this book as well. Take a look at the preview and see what you think, just do yourself the favor and read all of the preview and don't let the very beginning stop you.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of reading.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|sometimes when you have responsibilities, you cannot allow your feeling to interfere. But when love comes in. it changes everything.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This thing was garbage. The playback stuttered and the audio and video would not stay in sync. I gave it to a friend as a gag gift.
0345545338|5.0|Just as I expected. Also arrived promptly. Thanks! Great e-bayer, I look forward to our next exchange. I would recommend.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|I have been stoked for this CD since it was first announced.  I don't think I'm alone when I say I was more excited for the CD than the actual movie, and I wasn't disappointed.  While some of the songs may not fit great with the movie, the mixture of upbeat, dance-y hip hop and the much slower tunes is great.  I'm not a Lana fan, but Young and Beautiful is fantastic, but nothing can beat Florence + The Machine's Over The Love.  It is, in my opinion, one of their best songs ever.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I usually don't like Christmas songs, but these guys are really genius, they have no limit in creativity ! All their songs are really awesome !
B00GLX1MG6|1.0|This movie was raunchy and stupid, I would not reccomend it. The actors had no chemistry and the plot and acting was poor.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Fascinating documentary on the legendary, three-time F1 World Champion who tragically died in a crash at Imola in 1994.  This film shows the myth and the man, warts and all.  Devoutly spiritual, very generous with his money, a hero to his fellow Brazilians and tough as nails when racing.  It also documents his distaste for the politics in F1, his prickly relationship with Alain Proust, and, of course, his sublime skills and &#34;damn the torpedos&#34; focus behind the wheel.  Highly recommended for anyone even vaguely interested in racing, and even for anyone who isn't.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|good graphics fun to play guns are cool and easy to upgrade and the hunts get more challenging. as the game progresses
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|First time I used amazon movies and learned it don't have any subtitle (closed caption)  I am hearing impaired.  Disappointed!
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Fun! But long load times. Really enjoy the PS3 version. Hoping we see some of the DLC come to this version too.
B000002W9Q|5.0|I love the Dirty Dancing soundtrack...the music is so good.  And I loved the movie.  Who doesn't love Patrick Swayze!
0345803507|1.0|boy was this book so stupid and I believe it was unfair to women and I hate to think that girls will read it and think they should do this and be controlled by men.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Very well written! Couldn't put it down, a page turner from the beginning.  I loved that he brought back Jake Brigance
1612680011|4.0|Very much enjoyed the way the author gives his perspective on how the normal person makes a salary and doesn't think outside the box of the hours, weeks, and years that are spent working for someone else.<br /><br />Didn't necessarily agree with some of the avenues that he endorses - going into big-time debt to buy investment real estate. That lose the 5th star.
B00CE03UOC|3.0|Game takes a lot of thought. But very fun and can be very addictive. Good way to blow time. Done
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Best game ever nothing needs to be change just wish the ads wasn't there it would be really awesome but still a great game to play with family
B00GQ7OZR0|5.0|A crazy last season. Totally unexpected. I didn't expect the twist. I really don't know how I feel about the final episode but I enjoyed the rest of the season.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Awesome album from awolnation! I'm writing this review two years after the release of this album and I still have some of the songs on repeat..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this app is amazing I love it and think you will too. its super addictive and fun to play. you can earn lives from friends or buy them you also get a life every thirty minutes until you have five life's its agreat game. :*
B008602KQI|5.0|Wonderful movie.  I can't wait to see the next one.  I hope they start the last and final version soon.<br />Everyone is waiting for it, too.
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|This is ear garbage! There are only two good songs on this album: We Can't Stop and Wrecking Ball. The rest is pure crap. What's with all the swearing?! Miley is twenty-one so I get she's not thirteen anymore. But her swearing, twercking and smoking weed on stage make her appear like an out of control thirteen year-old! And to think she's one of the reasons why I bought a purity ring, to which she probably threw hers in the garbage. Such a bad role model for young girls. Parents, stick to Demi Lovato!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book blew my mind so much that I have completely changed my eating habits and have lost 50 lbs quickly!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|This is a great TV series, especially for couples. Not necessarily appropriate for the whole family, but it is a great way to spend a lot of time laughing with the &#34;Friends.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so totally addicted to this game.  I do not like the salt bombs and chocolate spaces at all, every time they show up I groan.  But it's satisfying to blow them up.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I was cautious in buying any non apple adapters for my iphone 5, but this guy works great! it actually seems to charge my phone faster than the apple brand as well. the light turns on to let you know it is plugged in all the way. MUCHO SATISFIED.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Once I picked this one up I couldn't put it back down I had to read all of the stories. All very well written with amazing character description. This book definitely took me for a ride, a couple of times had me wondering: \\"How can one come up with this?\\" The sci-fi and the fantasy is just mind boggling and will have you hooked and curious to know how the next story goes after reading the first. I'm looking forward on reading more from this author, kudos for delivering such a great book.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|You might as well start your collection now. This first season has some of the best episodes in it. Plus it's fun to go back and see the character development: Andrea, Glen, and Jon Bernthal as Shane (who is now gone).
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Classic movie! Really underrated as far as Pixar movies go, but I like it better than Finding Nemo or Toy Story 3. Definitely a must watch!
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|My brain cells fire when I find a new logic game to play!  I marvel at all the interesting puzzle APPS that have been developed and this one is definitely fun!  Although I found the tutorial to be pretty good, I was a little confused when I first started playing.  Once I got the hang of it, it seemed pretty easy... and then I discovered that I was only playing the easiest level!  Now it is a lot more challenging. Silly me! This is the same developer that made FlipPix which is a game that I also enjoy.  I am frugal and don't spend a lot of money on APPS.  Most of the APPS I have are free.  But I will definitely buy more HexLogic and FlipPix games.  They make my brain cells fire!
B00E6X4GAW|5.0|Beautiful, heart-wrenching story. A compelling read which is an inspiration to all youngsters. Malala's story is thought-provoking and begs the question ' What is the world doing to address education for all?'
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love such hubbub Chubb c'mon full sub full Chubb ssh j dunk Ann shim duff shy to shop chi hmm
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie- not as good as the book, but still good! I would not recommend watching this if you haven't read it. Much of the book is actually the inner thought process of Katniss, so you miss out on that in the movie.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I PLAYED THE ORIGINAL FACE BOOK GAME. THIS is way better. The way it is set up is much more user friendly
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is the best game on my kindle dragonvale is really a realy fun game my nephew really want's<br />it to
B00EDY5KTA|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack. &#34;Frozen&#34; contains songs that I can sing to and enjoy.  Idina Menzel sings the Let It Go&#34;.  This song is a gem.  It celebrates a character in the movie and her power to make beautiful things out of ice.  It is the kind of song that just makes me more confident in myself. &#34;For The Time In Forever&#34; is a song that symbolizes hope for a better life.  I really like the lyrics to this song.  Kristen Bell shows that she has a talent for singing too.  I never knew that she could sing.  &#34;Do You Want To Build A Snowman&#34; is very pretty  song that celebrates the joy of being a child. &#34;Love Is an Open Door&#34; is a song about the optimism of love.  These are well written songs from the people who provides the music for the hit musical &#34;Book Of Mormon&#34;. Jonathan Groff  sings a short funny song entitled &#34;Reindeer are Better Than People&#34;. Josh Gad provides an equally funny tune about a snow man in summer. The instrumental music score of Christoph Beck is a perfect compliment to all of the songs.  He captures suspense with the piece entitled &#34;Sorcery&#34;. He evokes romance with the piece entitled &#34;Winter's Waltz&#34;.  He creates a sense of danger with an intense piece entitled &#34;Wolves&#34;.  I felt all these emotions while watching the film, and that is because of the music.  I love all the songs and instrumental music on this soundtrack.  The music makes the film a special animated musical.
B00GT83J50|5.0|I get both Goodfellas and the Untouchables with this set!  Is there a way I could rate this 2 movie set more than 5 stars?  Since Amazon only goes up to 5 stars I'll have to settle for only 5 stars.  These two movies are classics that are not only great crime thillers but great movies under any genre.  Goodfellas and the Untouchables both feature the amazing acting of Robert Deniro.<br /><br />Goodfellas is a 1990 American crime film directed by Martin Scorsese.  It is a film adaptation of the 1986 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese.  The film follows the rise and fall of Lucchese crime family through the eyes of a Lucchese associate, Henry Hill.  The movie covers the period of time from 1955 to 1980.  The movie features the great acting of Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino.  Goodfellas was nominated for the Academy Award in the following categories: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Supporting Actor (Joe Pesci, who won).<br /><br />The Untouchables is a 1987 American crime drama directed by Brian De Palma and written by David Mamet.  The film is based on the book The Untouchables.  This film stars Kevin Costner as government agent Eliot Ness who is attempting to take down Al Capone.  The movie also features Robert De Niro, Sean Connery, and Andy Garc&iacute;a.  Untouchables was nominated for the Academy Award in the following categories: Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Sean Connery, Won), Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Score.<br /><br />I enjoyed both these movies a great deal and would definitely recommend this set.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Entertaining movie. A bit too &#34;by the script&#34;, but it was just about exactly what I was expected when I purchased it.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|This movie is incredibly intense! If you're looking for a normal &#34;zombie&#34; movie, this isn't it. It has zombies and can be quite creepy in places, but it's more intense than anything else. I had to own this one b/c it's so good. Brad Pitt's acting is incredible, and the movie was absolutely wonderful. I enjoyed it very much!
B001O1O71C|5.0|After having seen the movie of the same title, I was very interested in reading the book. It did not disappoint. A year in the life of two boys from two different worlds and a father whose \\"work\\" cost him more than he could have ever imagined. Excellent read.
B00936A0RU|2.0|Lawless was an ok movie that showed the world of bootlegging during the time when selling liquor was illegal.  The movie shows good and the bad that this world contained.  The movie features Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf, Guy Pearce, Jason Clarke, and Jessica Chastain.  The movie is actually based on a true story about the conflict that existed between law enforcement and the bootlegging proprietors.  The standout from this movie is Tom Hardy, he is an exceptional actor, and it shows in this movie.  Tom Hardy controls every scene he is in.  I also thought that Jason Clarke who played Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf's brothers was also very good.  But this movie was just average due to the weak writing and odd direction given to exceptional actors like Guy Pearce were given.  I enjoyed this movie but I can not recommend it for you to purchase.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Hilarious action flick makes great entertainment fun. Predictable moments but who cares. All worth the time. That's it. I loved it.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This movie is one of the creepiest I've seen in a very long time. I love horror movies, and this is one I definitely had to own to watch again and again. I saw this first in the theaters, and I was not disappointed! This movie made me jump several times! Must watch!!
B00003CXA2|5.0|No matter how many times you watch it this movie is still great. Makes me laugh every time. One of the best
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Inglourious Basterds is an amazing movie about an alternate timeline during the time of WW2.  The movie is well constructed and the writing is top notch, as to be expected from Quentin Tarantino.  The movie features a huge cast, some that were stars before this movie but more who are now star because of this movie.  The movie stars Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, and Diane Kruger.  The movie follows a group of U.S. soldiers who come from Jewish backgrounds and their plan to assassinate Nazi leaders while they attend a movie premiere.  The movie is not just a revenge film but a movie about love and humanity.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Kaben20<br />I own both of the Pianp Guys albums so when I heard they were doing a Christmas album I preordered it.  I Love, Love, Love the Pianp Guys , and the Christmas album is awesome.
B002PSXR2S|4.0|This movie is a lot of fun for anyone who truly loves horror movies of all sorts. It's a bit &#34;campy&#34; and silly, but tons of fun! I laughed most of the way through the movie, and Kevin Bacon was a fun addition to the cast, along with Reba McIntyre.
B00005JLZN|5.0|Kevin Spacey never disappoints and this movie is no exception. A movie full of twists that keeps you guessing until the end.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Just started the game but so far I like it.  Gave it a 4 because it seems to work on my phone pretty good
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book.  The message is loud and clear.  It also sets forth some of the facts about the special forces that protect us under sever circumstances.
B00DH7P6WU|5.0|Love that for the price you get 2 dolls. Great new line of \\"high dolls\\" I then purchased 4 more of these dolls for my granddaughter
B000AGTPUK|5.0|The kids really love this movie. So do a lot of the adults. A holiday classic that we watch every year.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thought this book was good but thought that Katniss almost as it seems crazy! That's just me though! Over all a good read that will keep you wanting more!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book left you wanting more. I love the way the author brought all the characters to life. I really did not want the book to end, it was just that captivating.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Okay so I got the free version if this game originally. But then it started showing some really nasty ads. So I deleted it. Then to my delight it showed up as FAOTD and I was so happy!! Because I really liked this game but I didn't want to see the inappropriate ads. So OBVIOUSLY I got it since the paid version was free for the day. But I was more than a little disappointed to find out that there is nothing different about the paid version except for the fact that there is no ads. Although it does pop up a black screen that makes it look like it showing an ad but it's not. And that really gets in my nerves because it's hard to get out of that screen. But other than all that  this is a good app that I would recommend  to pretty much anyone. But if you have little kids or don't want to see inappropriate ads yourself then BUY THIS VERSION. It is worth the 99 cents!!! Hope this helped. =)
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|A Nicholas Sparks story. There really is nothing else to say. It was a beautiful love story. I loved the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|ADDICTIVE, Can not stop playing this game.  Love the challenge but get mad at times.  Great stress relief and creator of stress.
0812993357|4.0|The book itself it art, and it lives on the coffee table where it belongs. The writing is good and it was a nice summer read as well.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Our family loves this movie!  Every year we watch it, as a family, at our local IMAX.  Even after 9 years, the 3-D technology is breathtaking!  This movie has a lot of heart and is a good lesson for all of caring and giving.
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|Beautiful singing and music.  The acting and filming are great but the music is superb.  Worth watching many times.  A good film to have in one's house.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I loved the romance and love that was incorporated into this story.  It was all very romantic. All i have to say is this book had alot of things going. While the book was great and so descriptive, i have to say the constant year and month jumping every chapter made it hard to keep track of what was happening when.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|Looking at this photo, I thought it was a nice gold / bronze bumper for my gold iphone. It came and was a dull, ugly brown. I cannot imagine anyone who would want a brown iphone bumper-- it's really just ugly!
B005HSL626|5.0|Free apps are not always free. They go up in price alot of times so why not give it a try and find out if you look the game
B003L77GG0|3.0|I forget what all the seasonS are about.  All I know is I liked the first 3 best.  Then it turned to crap for 4 & 5 I believe.  Maybe all of 4 and part of 5.  But around 5 or 6 it got good again.  Then around 8 or 9 it sucked again.  10, the last season, sucked too.  That's why I didn't watch it till I decided to complete my collection recently.  I had the first 8 seasons.  Might as well complete my collection.  I'm glad I did, because I got to watch a whole bunch of episodes that were new to me.  They weren't as bad as I thought they'd be, but still not as good as when the show started.  Heck, after 3 seasons, I'm sure you run out of ideas then get more later on.  That's probably what happened.  I didn't watch half of season 10 on TV, nor did I download it on a sharing network like I did for 8 and 9.  I did however watch the final episode.  Couldn't miss that one!  One thing I didn't like was in the last episode, they didn't really show Clark close up in the full Superman suit.  All those scenes were from afar and computer rendered I'm sure.  I'm not happy about that and remember not liking that when it first aired on TV.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was just insane... This is the first time where I've read a book and thought I knew what was going to happen, and I was so wrong . Most books you read and every time there is a climax...you think&#34;I know what gonna happen&#34;...and it does..so predictable right? Well this book...you never know why's going to happen. Here you have Nick an awful ass husband who doesn't deserve a good wife like Amy....or so you think... That's all I can say without ruining this for everyone else.. This book constantly left me shocked I found myself devouring this because I just needed to know why happened next
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great puzzles  good way to kill time at the airport or during flight<br />Lots of different puzzles and themes and also levels of experience
B0063IH60K|4.0|Free apps are not always free. They go up in price alot of times so why not give it a try and find out if you look the game
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|Fifteen years after her debut Britney can still delivery awesome music to her public,maybe it's not as personal as I thought but still has some soulful songs.<br />Fans will definitely love this albums and general public will enjoy .
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|LOOOVEEE IT - Just wish that there was more things that you could chat with - but overall I love the game!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|These guys can do no wrong!  I have loved every song and album they put out.  I'll continue to buy and support them!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|These free games are exactly that. nothing special usually, but it kills a few minutes when you need so why not!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the best game ever and I love the glacier dragon. You can make a bunch of dragons by breeding them and it may take a while but while you are waiting you can play other games or go out and eat and  you wont loose any progress.
B002SZAV8Q|5.0|I loved this movie!  And the two songs the group did were so awesome, that I added them to my iPod.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.
0345803485|1.0|!00% pure trash. It was silly and stupid. The writing is awful and I totally do not care about any of the characters.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Free apps are not always free. They go up in price alot of times so why not give it a try and find out if you look the game
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Has a lot of my favorite actors, lighthearted movie. Little slow at the beginning then is interesting how things and people come together
B00BEWCKFG|3.0|This pressing was very shallow, had poor tonal quality ... and a lot of surface noise. My $200 stylus plays other vinyl flawlessly but plays this as if it were made in a recording booth at the fair, and was dragged from the bumper all the way home. You are not supposed to hear pits and crackles after cleaning straight from the sleeve.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Used for recent trip - worked great to be able to charge two devices off one plug. Good product fairly rpiced. Have bought add'l ones as gifts.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Free apps are not always free. They go up in price alot of times so why not give it a try and find out if you look the game
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Dark, gloomy, depressing. Nothing like the original Superman (1978) with Christopher Reeve, which could be light hearted & funny at times. This was a waste of my 2.5 hours.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Awsome and beautifull movie!!! everybody should see it at least one time in their life! Very recommendable movie for everybody
1419701533|5.0|My grand son loves this product. I bought it for him as a Christmas  present. It arrived in a timely manner and the price was acceptable.
B008QMMEOE|3.0|These free games are exactly that. nothing special usually, but it kills a few minutes when you need so why not!
0553801473|5.0|The books are even more entertaining than the HBO TV show--if you haven't read them yet, now's the time! Let's hope GRRM is able to keep churning out the next two books of the series!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Been using it for a while now and I love this mouse. Never thought I would be able to move on from Deathadder. But this mouse definitely surprised me pleasantly.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|It's a great puzzle game that doesn't need WiFi :) the puzzles and games change enough to keep you entertained, along with the pretty neat story line.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  I liked the characters and the premise.  I am looking forward to the next one. Fun read.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This was my favorite book in the series, because if I remember correctly, it's the last book in which all the characters are featured together. If you're a fan of the TV show, now is time to read the books.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I am working on a Master's degree in SW and I loved the assessment and how direct Helen Hunt's character was.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Brain challenge for all ages.  Lots of fun and nice to look at too.  A new take on the childhood favorite Mazes.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Classic King tone and pacing with his amazing ability to voice characters that pull me in immediately. It was a fun read though I longed for more when it ended.
B000W93CHC|4.0|An entertaining read--long book but goes by quickly. Quite enjoyable! Definitely recommend if you enjoy architecture or just an enjoyable read.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|The remastered edition passes my expectations!! Picture and sound are top notch!! Better than I ever remember it! It will liven long and prosper
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I LOVE this movie!  The characters are relatable (if a bit over the top) and the music is super catchy (I find myself mumbling the words and humming the songs days after I watch it).<br /><br />There are a few &#34;gross out&#34; moments that I feel aren't necessary for the overall plot of the movie, but now that I've seen it more than once, I just fast forward through those parts.<br /><br />The Blu-ray offers a crisp HD picture (I gave the DVD disc to a co-worker since keeping both seems silly - especially with the digital and ultra-violet copies!) and I love the extra features.  I've watched both commentaries and I like the one that includes the director, Jason Moore, and producers Elizabeth Banks and Max Handelman.<br /><br />if you're a fan of a cappella, Rebel Wilson, or gross out humor involving chicks, consider Pitch Perfect your one stop shop.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Love everything about this game except one thing. The gold is too hard to earn. You only earn it when you level up or buy some. Need to earn one after you kill each &quot;boss&quot; animal.
0345529057|5.0|I must not have been the only person in my house to pick up a set of these books, because I swear we have a million copies lying around everywhere. Which is ideal, because they're great reads, no matter how many times you go through them.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I gave up wheat after reading this book and I'm still overweight, bloated, suffering from migraines etc.  I'm just not doubled up with pain anymore and spending half my day on the toilet.  Dr. Davis is probably onto something but I suspect, as with so many other things, it needs to be looked at in a broader context.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book caught my attention for many reasons: it takes place in 1986, the main characters are misfits who love punk music and comic books, and I enjoyed 'Attachments' by Rainbow Rowell.  Eleanor & Park surpassed my expectations!  From the first page, these characters drew me in and I immediately felt their awkwardness.  I loved them!<br /><br />Recently, I read in the newspaper that a local group called &#34;parents action league&#34; wanted to ban this novel from the school library due to profanity (mostly having to do with God and Jesus, of course!).  I don't think any of the language is out of character for teenagers and ultimately this book is about poverty, bullying, and first love.  I think the message of the story far outweighs any coarse language that is used, because both poverty and bullying are problems every generation has to deal with, and I think Ms. Rowell does an amazing job navigating her characters through the maze of high school.<br /><br />Told in alternating 3rd person POV, Eleanor & Park is a must read for anyone who grew up in the 80s, has teen children, or wants to read a poignant love story between two misfits who believe.  This book will make you believe, too, even while it breaks your heart.
B00CKJ2KK2|2.0|I'm online I go to multiplayer it searches it says failed to connect then I go back and it says not online it only let me do it once that's why I rated it 2 stars but you tricked me game loft u are the the WORST. U SHOUD BE CALLED TRICKERS OF BLITZ BRIGADE
0307477479|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. I didn't know what to expect when I started reading it, so was delightfully entertained by the way all the short narratives weave themselves together. It's a solid book that you should pick up asap.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Riveting drama, well acted, well written. Intense. Small town population makes this like a parlor mystery, something the Brits excell at.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Kept me wanting to see what was coming next.  Can't wait to see the next episode in the series.  A1 entertainment!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the movies and wanted to find out what happens next, since the movies left me in suspension. The book was worth the read.
B006W0QR1S|4.0|I wanted to really like this movie, but didn't connect with it as much as I was hoping--the characters' aloofness seems to rub off on the audience a bit. However, great soundtrack and cinematography, and you should watch it.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie so much! It is an annual Halloween tradition that my sister and I watch it every year.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|My favorite period in Bruce's discography. Enjoy listening over and over again....It is just One Way Street, once you put it in your player, it is inside forever! :-)
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME A LOT I WANT ALL MY FRIENDS TO PLAY THIS GAME TOO LOVE IT YEAH REALLY
0316066524|4.0|This book is an excellent door stop. I propped it up in front of my bedroom door, and even when large gusts of wind come in through our large bedroom window, the door stays put. Haven't tried reading it, though I hear it's great.
B00F8BC8EW|5.0|Great to see this 1980s classic in blu ray.  The movie, the fashion and music are iconic for that time period.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first book, I knew that I'd HAVE TO READ all three episodes.  Now that the movies are coming out, everyone should read the books first or you will NOT grasp the full intent of Suzanne Collins intended outcome and moral.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|The story of Sarah was a good one.  Julia's story was a bit predictable, but overall I enjoyed reading about a little known piece of history.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. I love the movie, and I'm sure that no one needs this review since just about everyone has probably read this by now.
1576875776|5.0|What a great and inspiring book.  Street photography is not as easy as Vivian Maier makes it look in this book.
B005V5WBFG|4.0|Appears to do what it says by working quietly in the background when I use my tablet.  I can only assume it is doing its job in keeping me safe from viruses, malware, etc. since I have not had any problems or glitches since I installed McAfee.
B00AAI7B7W|2.0|An old movie that I have seen many times. I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as good as the first book (is anything ever as good as the first book?), but still super entertaining, and the movie was great too.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Like Ludlum, the plot is intriguing, twisting, and you have to keep reading because of the intensity.  The characters are flawed human beings, true to Interactions from book to book.  I am already looking forward to his next book.
0634060384|5.0|A great collection of jazz standards.  I I find it easier and quicker  to flip open this book than to go online or on a CD and find a song.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|It was great to bring back Corrie from \\"Still life with crows\\" and to have Pendergast tie in Sherlock Holmes into the storyline with the help of as always one of his Cronies. The storyline is fast-paced and as always one never knows what's going bloom out of the authors mind. This is one of many Preston, Child must reads. I often find myself rereading a thriller from their vast collection, they never disappoint, I can bring anyone back into play at anytime this and their library are page turner.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|I'm 27, and watch a lot of artsy or R-rated movies, but I adored this film. Even my parents liked it--we still quote lines to each other over the phone. The minions are the best.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game keeps my grandson entertained at every level.  Great graphics and fun little twists keep the player on their toes!
B00005KB9X|4.0|A great collection of classic Marley tunes. The studio sound quality is better on this recording than on many of the live recordings out there.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I can't get enough of this movie! I can only hope that they put more of Q in the upcoming films! His character is a refreshing one.<br />I'm sure people can argue with me for hours on this, but Skyfall was MY favorite Bond film!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A departure from the storyline of the first and second book, but it ties up the series nicely, and I'm excited to see it as two movies.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This is an inspiring movie from which many messages of personal faith seem to clash in an indictment of established religion.  Compelling.  I've watched it every year since it was released.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|The king of darness outdoes himself in this amazing live recording. The musicians and singers who accompany LC are all outstanding. It's ana amzing collection of his tunes.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Star trek . NOTHING MORE TO SAY..my first time viewing all these films.wish I did it sooner.needed more lennard nimmoy
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you thought &#34;The Huger Games&#34; couldn't be topped, wait until you finish this book. This was an amazing read and you really find yourself lost in the plot.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Just love it!!! A beautiful piece of art!!! Bandai has made this into a great &#34;toy&#34; and collectors from all over the world will be pleased if they order this doll!
B0034U4QLM|4.0|Ry Cooder and the Chieftains are simply amazing.  This recording is like a very tasty corned beef and cabbage burrito. It's a very unique combination of Mexican and Irish soungs.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Enjoyable movie.good cast great acting.worth watching again.it's amazing what people go threw while working in these middle eastern countrys.why they want2work there I seriously don't understand.maybe for cash or risk with no reward dumb&greedy in my opinion
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The music is so beautifully played it brings me to tears.  Love all of it! Would give it 100 stars if I could!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I think that real steel is a awesome game because it has different robots and the graphics are awesome to I really really like this game a lot!!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I guess with any good series it must end. I must say it had me until the end, but did not end the way I had hoped. Enjoyed all three books.
B00006FDCD|4.0|Great story.now I no y people are scared of clowns.I wish cast was better wasn't impressed with the cast.this movie needed to big names &2me maybe a bit rushed in some sceens.example death in hotel&jail escape.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My favorite book of 2013, maybe my favorite book of all time!  I simply adore this book!  It will break your heart and make you scream out loud. And then slowy mends the broken pieces of your heart.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!
B00AEBB9SM|5.0|Hey It's Sunnydale Chick here....I didn't want my review to be like everyone else's....(figuring that there were more people now who understood this...then when I saw this.....so I have a pretty cool comparison with an episode of Goosebumps I saw a few months ago called One day at Horror Land (I watched this while I was celebrating Halloween....and it IS REALLY COOL Just how close these are. These 2 kids want to go to This New amusement park. And the girls Uncle made the place so they get free tickets....and are very exited once they're in the park.....until they think the place is haunted.....and eventually they make it to the front of the park and strangely we find out (from an odd pause earlier from her Uncle when she mentions something about a mother) it's strange because she's NEVER had a mother......she's a robot.....Her And her brother are 2 in a long line of robots who work at the park, and even though he thought these were starting 2 work......something was still off.....Like how Truman was programmed into this world....and he had to be set free from this world that he'd been created into.....in order to have a normal human life.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Great movie, this was my generation and it is funny and the music brings back a lot of memories. Forget about who the characters are played by and just go with the flow.
B009AMANH4|3.0|Nice story of a great man.this movie needed a better ending I wanted to see how Lincoln was killed.why not put it in.silly
1449410243|3.0|I thought this would be better...Seems like more than half the book is that office cat comic which wasn't that funny.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Love love love this game. Being great at strategy myself I find it challenging and engaging. I recommend it to everyone.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Not too happy with the product. WiFi was not a happy connection. Several connection issues with the laptop too. Works well with You Tube and Netflix but not well with streaming Chrome from laptop.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is back and its better than ever I see alot of people having alot of problems like there wifi its u just got to be in a certain place or home to log in like I tried to log in school it didn't work but, if u log in at it will work it depends though but, I love kik I will always use it : )
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The scenes are vivid. Puzzles are fun. Not quite as much fun as mystery manor, but still a good time.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Laugh out loud funny and painfully true! Her drawings put it over the top. Do not read in public if you want to save your dignity!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like the game since  this is th  only facebook game I can play on my kindle. However their  should be a way to save the game. When I got my new kindle, I had to start everything all over again. I hate that.<br />.
078689136X|3.0|Fine, you can visualize the actors from TV 'Castle', and they are fencing over the wild fantasies in Castle's novels. However, there is something extra in these stories; like more elaborate dialogue and action outside the police station (it costs nothing to write about new locations). -Such as the streets of New York, elevators, laundries, seedy hotels, a rehearsal hall and a recording company lobby. And those sexy interludes which bother TV Kate so much.<br />In brief, a gossip columnist is dead, body missing, the snatch team had automatic weapons, her long-lost daughter is a suspect, so is a celebrity chef and a recovering pop-star. Again, Heat must use her combat skills in another struggle with an assailant. Hearing Nikki's thoughts adds so much to solving the case.<br />A few details cross over from the TV episodes, giving the book a deja vu feel.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Definitely one of the best films on the Tuskeegee Airmen!  Great acting, but not &#34;over-acting&#34; or &#34;wooden performances&#34; as so many films today have.  It puts you on the edge of your seat through the whole movie.  No dead spots.  And, it portrays the black pilots as the human beings that they were.........not idealized or deamonized.......just plain folks trying to make a difference in bringing an end to the war.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app is absolutely horrible. It won't let me log in and it always says it's taking long too log in. It's bad. Just&hellip;&hellip; AMAZON&reg; please improve this app. But right now.....nobody get this app.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|This video was an interesting perspective on climate change (especially being caused by humans), that, at first I was enthusiastic about, but am less so now that more information from the scientific community has come forth.  There are more current videos to watch on the subject now.
B00EP0SIOG|2.0|Got bored with it.  My puppy found it entertaining, but I got tired of driving it around for her.  Not were over 100 bucks.  Maybe small children would have more fun with it.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Hey, I'm a railfan since childhood -- and I enjoy a really good story (interesting story development, character development, with a dash of action and excitement, along with romance and heroics thown in).  This film has all that and more!  Unlike so much of the garbage spewing out of Hollywood today -- this film has no nudity, good values instilled, and almost no bad language.  It's action-packed, but not with a lot of senseless violence......but with people drawing upon inner courage in the face of sheer terror.  A real nail-biter for sure!  And you'll find yourself cheering at the end.
B002WY65W4|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie it is the bomb... when twinkies went away I was sad.. how could you have Zombies with out the twinkie..
0694003611|5.0|This was a gift for a friend's baby shower. She says she loves the item, so that is all that matters.
0385537131|5.0|Grisham is the best storyteller about the south and the practice of law .  i have read every book and look forward to the next one
0857867180|5.0|Oh my this is the best book i have ever read, it is funny how he proves everyone is in sales and the best way to become a great salesman, this is one of my favourite books
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|really, really  funny!!! my husband and I loved this movie, it's so stupid funny, a little dirty but over all, just good comedy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great example of a teenager's life looking in from the outside. A book to remember. Recommend this book for all ages.
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|Fun game. Nice stress reliever for me after a hard day's work. Like to take out frustration on the other cars
B0011HF6GE|5.0|This is one of those albums- along with Iron & Wine's &#34;Creek Drank the Cradle&#34;, Sufjan Stevens' &#34;Come on, Feel the Illionoise!&#34;, and Bright Eyes &#34;I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning&#34;- that hits me really, really hard. It is sheer beauty in compact disc form. I am a huge fan of Bon Iver, and this was the album that made me fall in love with him. Give it a listen.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter because she never misses a show. She was extremely happy to receive this gift!
B004XQO8JG|5.0|Classic! Loved it the first time I saw this movie as a kid! Blu ray preserves the memory for me.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|I liked this, but I thought the build up toward the end could have been done better. Yes, I was surprised by the ending, but I think the payoff would have been better if could have had an inside view of what was going on in the main characters mind as he contemplated continuing the lie or telling the truth.
0399255370|5.0|I loved this book! Bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas! I know she will love it. Hope she will read it to me:)
B0055SWM08|5.0|By far one of the most unique, fun, and challenging puzzle games I have ever played. Works flawlessly on the original Kindle Fire, 1st gen. Perfect movements and music to play before bed, its relaxing and fun at the same time without being too difficult.
B002OFWG7E|4.0|good value and good looks. it was the CD that i needed to complete my massive foo collection for the ages.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I just wish u didn't have to buy the extra moves or boosters. I'm on disability income and after buying some for a few levels that's all I can afford. pl remember the people that still love to play games but can't afford the extras the whole game. thank you
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Amazing, beautiful rendition of Oh Come, Oh Come Emanuel .... The choirs  in Heaven rejoice in this praise of God's own Son!
B0009U5DD0|5.0|If you want a great compilation of songs performed by one of the most internationally-known musical groups, this would happen to be it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a simple, easy to read calculator and this is it. I love the large buttons and easy-on-the-eye colors. It also has memory buttons and other functions like square root that my kids use to check their homework.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is awesome!!!<br />Read this book to find out what happens to Pita and Katniss I found out you should too!!!
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|First of all, I loved the philosophy of cherishing the rights of the creative individual over the &#34;go with the flow&#34; train of thought.  Beyond that, I thought Gary Cooper was the ultimate man's man!!
B00AEBBA1I|5.0|I truly enjoy the performances of all the actors in this musical with the exception of one, who shall remain nameless, because he (OK...I'll call him &#34;Borat&#34;)...because Borat has no idea what acting is -- he always goes all-out & over-the-top -- and that, dear Borat, is NOT acting.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I have the kindle fire hd.  The graphic are good and has a great tutorial to show you how to play.  It's a fun game to play. There is no permissions and no Wi-Fi required. I would get this while it the FAOTD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so hard to put down! I can hardly wait to read the next book! Even though I had already seen the movie, I knew I had to read the book.
B005O64VH8|5.0|The plaintive sound of the mixed Irish-Scandinavian harmonies touches one's heart and speaks of longing and mysticism.  I have many Secret Garden CD's and even if songs are repeated, listening to them again and again speaks volumes of feelings to me.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Very fun and exciting I love unlocking new characters. I love how each character has a list of objectives to complete
B00BXDOSXS|4.0|The player it self works good but it will not update the library when new material is added, you have to remove the app then reinstall with each movie added to my KindleHD for the new titles to be registered in player.
0671646788|5.0|This book was required reading for executives in the world's largest manufacturer of main frame computers, and rightfully so!  I've read it and review it every couple of years.  Also give it to each of my children and grand children on graduation from school.  It's so full of common sense the politically correct generation probably can't understand it.  I'm retired now, but I've never seen a  small book make such big and positive changes in people's lives and careers.<br /><br />Schwartz says, &#34;You are or you become that which you think about most&#34;.  It's so packed with undeniable truths.<br /><br />NOTE: I'm not employed by or related to the publishers of this book in any way.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I absolutely love this thing. I always wanted to watch netflix on the television but I have never found the need to buy an apple TV or a gaming console to use this feature. For 30 dollars you get to stream youtube and netflix with a click of a button. After learning how to set the device up, which is fairly easy thanks to the helpful google instructions I finally get to see this thing in action.<br /><br />PRO:<br /><br />The picture when streamed to your TV is in clear 1080. Im not sure if this applies to everyone but I think the picture is absolutely amazing. It's above and beyond my fios cable service in HD. Picture is crystal clear and I have yet to see any lag or pauses among the video at all.<br /><br />CON: The load time on some of the things you stream like netflix can be quite slow. I casted a video over to netflix which took about 15-30 seconds of buffering. Sometimes after you hit the stream button on your ipad or phone your not sure if it worked. It's not the most annoying thing in the world but I do hope that it does get fixed.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I quite love Pendergast. No two ways about it. This book drove me crazy; it followed me into the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, the bedroom, and rode in my car so I could read while waiting for appointments. I'm reading White Fire now, and I ask the authors for one thing: write more and faster.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am PISSED that I wasted all this time reading three novels only to find that the protagonist is DEAD after surviving nearly the insurmountable. So cruel of the author to deny her audience the triumphant and happy ending.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome! if you like to use Netflix, YouTube or Pandora this is a must have.  I cant wait until they add more apps.
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|What an amazing album. I loved the music that Avicii has put out in the past as he is truly one of my all time favorite producer. I rarely find the need to buy albums anymore with spotify at the tip of my fingers but knowing the streaming service doesnt pay artist that much for their work didn't sit right with me. I will usually buy an album even if I have access to spotify if I love the entire album. This is one of those rare cases which I had decided to purchase the album. Amazing swing vibes that are still very avicii like to their core. It's about the way the music makes you feel not about the sounds. Very experimental for this artist and at the same time amazing. Many people will say avicii sold out. I dont see how you can be a sellout if your being completely original.
B00275EGWY|5.0|Really good movie. The special effects in this movie are really incredible. The movie has a great story line and Jeremy Renner is superb in his role. He is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. Great movie, highly recommended.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I enjoyed the game well enough, but it is very backwards. Things that are normally good in game play (experience points, level ups, leveling up your dinosaurs, etc.) are bad things in this game.  Evolving your dinosaurs through just one evolution cycle takes about three years of play to break even not even counting the food cost to get to that evolution. Optimal game play seems to be to do almost nothing.  Build buildings, collect coins, and do NOTHING else.
0920236162|5.0|Amazing and hysterical. Definitely recommend for any little girl that tends to be very independent or even ones that aren't.
B0080BFWAE|5.0|If you haven't seen the movie, I highly recommend it. It is a comedy, but it isn't silly and there are some good points in the movie.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I can talk to my friends and family and it does not say I can't do eny thing it always works if ur having truble sorry
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I have loved this movie since it was in theatres and my dad and mom took my brothers and me to see it on a whim because we had to wait a few hours for the tree lot to get a new shipment of Christmas trees. The magic of the movie itself was made even more special by this spontaneous family outing.<br /><br />That said, the movie totally holds up - Christmas spontaneity notwithstanding. It is, hands down, my favorite Muppet movie. You'll sing along with the songs, you'll quote along with the silly moments. It's wonderful!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|It has helped bring the Spirit of Christmas into my heart with every note. I love it, the peace, the calm, the Spirit of Christ that you can feel as this music speaks to your soul. Love it!!
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|I loved this fun coming of age story about a girl's first year at college. It was cute to &#34;watch&#34; her grow up and still try to maintain the identity she desperately didn't want to lose. I liked the twin sister dynamic, the love interests, the roommates... a very fun, pretty quick read. Also, it didn't hurt that it basically revolved around Harry Potter (Simon Snow) fanfiction :)
B00821OX98|4.0|A very enjoyable sci-fi series.  We watch it religiously when a new season starts and go through withdrawals for a little while in between series.  We wanted to see Season 1 again because we couldn't remember how it all started.
B00FN811SY|5.0|While I'm quite sure the app itself is excellent, I am very dissatisfied with my kindle 's inability to run the app without tons of red tape. It looks like Amazon has made this one the most difficult apps to find and download for the kindle fire HD 8.9. The only reason I purchased a tablet in the first place was to use the jw.org app as well as downloading theocratic material for ease of use. I'm seriously considering returning this kindle to get an iPad. At least then I know it won't take hours to find a way to download a simple application.
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|This is an entertaining movie with some flaws.  Roger Ebert's review is right on target but I still liked it more than he did.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I feel like I've been waiting forever for this book! There is some repeat content from her blog, but lots of new stories too. She literally has me laughing out loud, almost to the point of tears, in many of her stories. I love Allie, MS Paint, and the simple dog!
B001JI5DRC|5.0|This is one of those movies that captures you and pulls you into the movie. You relive it with them
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|This movie was not as entertaining as the first. The plot took waaay tooo long to develop. Not as good. just okay. We did not laugh as much and the plot was lacking the punch from the first story..
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Most difficult to set down. The imagery is spectacular. I'm going out to purchase several for gifts! Even if the subject matter is difficult to read, the pictures painted are priceless. It's been a long time since a book brought so many emotions to the surface for me. Thank you Mr. Zusak!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is moving and thought-provoking.  The point-of-view from which it is told is so very unique and unexpected.  I couldn't put it down.  I recommend this book to anyone who is even slightly interested in the history of WWII, whether they prefer fiction or non-fiction.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was fun to return to the landscape of the shining, easily the scariest book I've ever read. This one was not even close to as scary but was imaginative with a great cast of characters. Loved it!
B004SIIBGU|3.0|App is ok. You can do some basic things with it... probably should have rated it a 4, but my God do I hate ebay...
B002T9H2ME|5.0|Have you seen this movie?  Why not?  Buy it.  Don't rent it.  Buy it.<br /><br />As for the BluRay itself, decent quality with little or few extras.  But again, the movie in itself is enough to warrant the purchase.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|For some reason I didn't find this movie to be &#34;powerful&#34;.  I'm used to Washington being in more memorable movies.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is super fun! it even has multi-player on the same tablet, really enjoy playing this game! love it!
B008602KQI|5.0|Action packed with a believable story line. Nice to watch a movie thats not polluted with vulger, offensive language, but still intence scenes that capture the imagination and pull at the heart while stimulating the brain! Good job. hope the sequal lives up to this standard.
B000SXOLPE|5.0|All the GFR Live albums are awesome this one is truly a treasure!<br />(madonna is in the rnr hall of fame Grand Funk Railroad is not ?)<br />That tells me the rock n roll hall of fame is a joke !<br />If you want to listen to true RnR buy this!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love anytime a console game connects back to a mobile game especially with rewards. Excellent system. I also like the card strategy behind the game as well.
B001HN690O|5.0|I love it!<br />Kids love it!<br />They memorized all the lines!!!!<br /><br />I love the oriental culture/philosophy reflected in this movie and a sense of humor is a bonus!
B00B5HQL50|3.0|Week. Not the suave, sexy, techno filled excitement I grew up watching. Not even close to cutting edge. They broke the mold with Shawn Connery.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|In looking for an app to replace a real fan sound, this one was the perfect sound. I can even change the pitch as well as the volume. Yes they have many more sounds, but all I needed was the fan. Oh and you can choose how long you want the app to run. Well worth the $. &acirc;&ordm;
B0026IUXME|5.0|A spectacular look at the cruelty of the Jewish holocaust of WW2 and how the power of art can transcend war and politics.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Upon watching this movie I was a little bit skeptic because it was a young adult adaption.  I assumed it would be poorly scripted and made like the Twilight films and others in that vein.  I was terribly mistaken.  Jennifer Lawrence gives the performance of a life time.  This is a very well made movie which kept me interested the whole time.  This is a great addition to the collection.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Absolutely cannot get ahead without spending gobs of money. Any game which requires you to pay so much to play is no longer fun. I am deleting today!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Nice app. Customizable with your own music, snooze length,, volume, and more.  Really useful. Has a timer,as well. Don't hesitate.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|If you care about your health and the health of your loved ones - READ THIS BOOK!  It is life-changing.  Although there is a lot of technical information and research to back up his theories, the book is written for us to understand and to embrace.  My husband and I have been making significant lifestyle changes as a result of reading this book and we're feeling better physically and emotionally.<br /><br />Don't wait and don't hesitate.  Read the book NOW!  It will save and extend your life.
B000J10ERO|3.0|Not as bad as everybody says it is.  It runs a little long.  Roth is not the greatest actor but Synger seems to have put his heart into this one.  Glad WB decided to go with a reboot instead of a sequel.
B00004XPPE|4.0|I just viewed this DVD the other night. It's a bit slow to start, but interesting once it gets going. It is an older black and white film with lots of character interaction. It would make an excellent stage play as everything depends on the actor's emotions and how they deliver their lines. It has a great cast with Walter Matthau as a war hungry advisor, introducing Fritze Weaver as an emotionally unbalanced Colonel, a young Larry Hagman as an interpreter to the President, and  Henry Fonda as the Commander In Chief. Not many viewers would enjoy this film because it's b&w and lack of shoot 'em up action.<br />Overall, this is worthwhile film to watch at least once. The premise it is based on is a very scary one. What would happen if by some accident a squadron of U.S. bomber jets are on the way to Moscow to bomb it because they believe they attacked the U.S. first, which they didn't. No one knows what really happened: Was it a computer glitch, or the Russian's jamming that caused the Fail Safe system to fail? Moscow is bombed and millions are killed there.  As a result, Henry Fonda must make a decision in order to avoid World War III. What he chooses to do will stun you, but makes perfect sense to show good faith to the Russians.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|finally jumped on the bandwagon. very addictive, but lots of fun. highly recommended. connect with friends on facebook to gain more lives.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|This is the best ever. I love this series. I hope there's a next one. I recommend for 9 and up
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the pace..the story is better and better.  This is a series that you don't want to end.  I plan to see the movie soon!<br />I am anxious to start reading Mockingjay.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|It's a great story, and very well told. It's clean and succeeds in presenting a different space society. WS is a very convincing commander. He just acts very rigid and controlled, and seems to emote years of that. His son, on the other hand, although he is very good, doesn't seem to convince near the end that he has the control needed to do &#34;that thing&#34; needed to survive &#34;that thing&#34;. Regardless, I needed 2 hours of sci-fi escape, and this was perfect.
B0072IUZUS|5.0|Great product. Colors vibrant. Very realistic and detailed. We love all the farm animals and were not aware of all Schleich fantasy creatures!  Would buy more if granddaughters ask!
B00E4W40C4|4.0|As soon as THE WOLVERINE hit the theaters – I was there Friday morning to watch it. Yeah, yeah…I skipped the screening…didn’t want any knuckleheads to ruin this one for me. (lol)<br /><br />I liked this one…definitely more than the last Wolverine movie. Blahhhh. For me…THE WOLVERINE was a tight little package. Kick ass fight scenes…a cool, dark story…hot Asian girls…and NINJAS!! LOTS OF NINJAS!! (lol) Did I have any complaints? Not really…like I said…I liked it. I’ll probably add this one to my DVD/Blu-ray collection.<br /><br />Mike - iWatchMike.com
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my father who lives in AZ., He absolutely loves this CD and plays it in the car all the time.  I had it shipped to him, worked out beautifully!!!
1401937519|5.0|My 5 stars don't mean I agree with it all; it just means that this woman gave me the most material to chomp on and toss around in my mind for weeks after finishing the book. Amazingly challenging regardless of your faith. Put it this way: Read her, and when you think she said something directly opposing one of your beliefs, stop, and consider that maybe she isn't.
0316228583|2.0|The Casual Vacancy follows the lives of a few families in a small England town. When a well-liked local councilman dies, the fight for his seat becomes the primary plot point. At issue is the fate of a not-so-good area of town, The Fields, and whether the local community should cast it off.<br /><br />This book is most certainly a character-driven novel more so than plot-driven. Not too much actually happens (until the end) but we follow the complex lives and intertwined relationships of the town. My biggest struggle was remember who was who for the first 10-20 percent. I would *highly* recommend anyone who reads this look up a list of characters on the web. I used the Kindle Search function quite a bit until I got them all straight.<br /><br />Anyway, I had a lot of trouble getting into the novel. I likely would have put it down after the equivalent of 74 pages (my 100-your age rule of how much to give a book) had it not been for my fiancee also reading it. However, by about 45 percent, I was interested...enough.<br /><br />I found that Rowling only did an adequate job of filling in important character details. Many questions about the history of the characters remain, even if they aren’t vital (ex, why did the Wall’s have to adopt? How did Barry come to his position on the council? What came of Parminder Jawanda?).<br /><br />Furthermore, a few plot points were a stretch. (How did Fats learn enough to hack the site? And Sukhvinder? Why did Krystal jump to the making a baby idea? What about her rape?). It was details like that which left my scratching my head.<br /><br />Anyway, right now, having just finished, I would rate the book 2/5. I imagine this is the kind of thing that when I look back on it, I will appreciate it more as I think about the characters and the life they led.<br /><br />Oh, and I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that I found one GLARING Harry Potter reference: ”They might have been involved in some secret war of which the rest of the world knew nothing” (Location 715/8045 on my ebook version, around 9 percent).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It took me awhile but I finally broke down and tried it, but glad I did. This is a great time killer with plenty of challenges and a ton of levels.
B000J3Q8U4|4.0|Not as good as the first, but higher quality video definition. Fun to watch as a couple. Worth the watch.
B001NA2NM4|3.0|Interesting if you like old movies. A bit macabre. Not much of a story line. It was kind of hard for me to keep the &#34;good blonde&#34; and the &#34;bad blonde&#34; straight unless they spoke.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I love Channing Tatum so I usually watch every movie he makes, I was a bit hesitant to watch this as I was a fan of the original 21 Jump Street tv series with Johnny Depp. So I took a chance, but I must admit that this is hilarious. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, make an awesome comedic duo. So if you're hesitant like I was, fear not because you will be surprisingly entertained.
B00GPBZQ3Y|3.0|Digital pop may be all about sonic perfection, but soul, substance and emotion, is frustratingly lacking. &#34;Britney Jean&#34; is an almost pristinely crafted result but, for an album that was suggested to be personal, not much intimacy or depth are showcased. Billed as a sequel to career-highlight and fan-favourite, &#34;Blackout&#34;, it made no sense to launch the album's campaign with a hummering electro-club anthem called &#34;Work b*tch&#34;. For the most part, &#34;Britney Jean&#34; is heavily auto-tuned, polished, with melodic electro-pop stompers, and only a few sparse personal touches. The insanely addictive &#34;'Til it's gone&#34; combines great vocals over a massive beat-frenzy; &#34;It should be easy&#34; with its Daft Punk-esque bassline is another thundering affair; and &#34;Tik tik boom&#34;'s crawling beats are irresistibly sexy. On the more subtle side, are the wonderfully isolating, yet, intimate gentle opener, &#34;Alien&#34;; &#34;Passenger&#34;, a guitar-led midtempo with a mystical vibe; and closing track &#34;Don't cry&#34; whose fragility is reminiscent of former - sublime - single &#34;Everytime&#34;. Publicity implied that this would be an intimate affair, with Britney herself saying this is an album &#34;specifically for my diehard fans&#34;, referring to it as her &#34;most personal record yet&#34;. It is not. Evidently, it is more of an experiment than an autobiography, a transitional record, being her first album released in her thirties. Over the years Britney has been grabbing hold of trendy musical ideas in the most unnuanced ways possible. That is a task she has skillfully accomplished. That is what makes hit albums. &#34;Britney Jean&#34; could be one.
B000002LBH|4.0|classic smiths..Morrissey and johnny marr make you wish that they had never broken up. this music is a blend of artistry and sublime and deftly played melodies..awesome music that will never go out of style..i never tire of hearing these songs..gbs..god bless smiths
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Absolutely one of the best movies ever made. Really not much more to say except loved that it came with the digital copy so we can load it up on tablets and/or phones before long trips.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Beautiful music....you can never go wrong with the Piano Guys!  What a great team of talented musicians.  My best Christmas CD along with Steve's Cello Christmas CD.  A must have.
B005EHILV4|2.0|In the picture it looks like a decent size but it is very small and doesn't stay where I put it when I hook it up because it is very light and moves around.  Not very useful. Wish I never bought it. Not worth the money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app! It has good graphics and lots of challenges. Based off the original Despicable Me movie, you get to play as a minion! You can buy other minions with  hats and different clothing. You also collect bannanas for cash. You can play through Gru's lab, residential area, El Macho's Lair, etc. TRUST ME, YOU WILL LOVE IT!
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|This was one of the best series ever on TV action packed every season. If you haven't seen it yet, you're in luck because the best way to watch it is to have the option to move right on to the next show because it is continual cliffhangers one after another.
B00992CF6W|1.0|its cool for when you get it but it sucks people.want to cheat.and then other people want to cheat all the time it sucks
1401307450|5.0|I love this book! I literally laughed and cried while reading. The stories Kiedis tells of his life and the Red Hot Chili Peppers' adventures are truly endearing!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome the graphics are a lot better than the first one I persuade u guys to get this you'll love it
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|If you only add one new instrumental Christmas CD to your collection this year, this should be it.  It's many of the songs we all know and love, and a few lesser known ones, as well.  The neat thing about The Piano Guys is that they take really good music, blend it together, put a new spin on it, and make it better than the originals.  Definitely worth buying the Deluxe Edition! These guys are great family guys who know the true meaning of Christmas, and it comes across in their music.  So, what are you still reading this for?  Just buy it.  You won't be sorry.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read and good for book club! Everyone in our club loved the book but the ending frustrated most of us!
B00FOQRNPA|5.0|Very enlightening. This book has been passed around and discussed endlessly<br />with family and friends alike.  David's &#34;diet&#34; is being taken to heart<br />and I for one feel much better for it.<br />I haven't felt deprived in any way lowering my carb intake to around 40grams a day<br /> And even eating saturated fat instead of cutting it off my meat has been good.  I have<br />actually lost weight in the 4 weeks I have been following the program with seemingly no effort.<br /> Keep up the good work David.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's very fun game and once start playing it is hard to stop, levels do get hard but it fun way kill time if need to.
B008JFURII|5.0|Great movie....have seen it once but this is the type of movie you can watch several times because there is so much action & funny lines you never get it all watching it only once.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book!  Keeps you guessing the whole time.  A very unique mystery story, not something you've seen 100 times on every cop drama on TV.  Loved it!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Its good. It's about trains and Christmas. It has Tom Hanks in it. The Polar Express is always very good.
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|I love this game. It's my favorite game. There's one MAJOR problem  a lot of the time the game will say failed connections. Another problem is that  there are only 4 areas  of which you play in. All in all, if they fix the flaws I will change my rating.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Cannot get one without the other.  Great movies (Red & Red2).  They can both be watched over & over. You will see & hear  things you never noticed before because of the fast paced action.  Loved the funny lines.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I originally watched the movie before I picked up this book. Some of my friends told me that the book was much better, but I had no idea how much better the story could be!
B008602KQI|3.0|It wasn't a bad movie but it was all the same. I could look the other way with some of the cheap sets and acting but the story was way too long and bland. When you finally get to the fighting (I had no idea that kids would be killing kids, so that took me by surprised) your cringing at the fact that you know a little 12 year kid is going to end up dead and it just kills the whole movie for me. I really don't want to see kids killing kids and quite frankly, I'm not always wanting to see killing in all movies either. To say that the movie is criticizing our own culture does show, there is meaning in there but then others have done that years ago and when is it taken too far and overblown?
0345529057|5.0|I was waiting to have this, I read it in Spanish and watched the TV series, I still think that the book is way better, it´s a must have..  I will enjoy the winter reading this
B00942G4UA|4.0|Very spot on in terms of what big corporate food producers are doing and how they manipulate the government. Makes you think about what you are putting in your stomach.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I am enjoying this game so far  I am still in the free play it is easy to get around  and no glitches so far . I will buy it if it continues  to be the same. I just finished the free part of the game and was really enjoying it but 4.99 is more than I am willing to pay.2.99 is the most I am willing to pay. If the price comes down I will definitely get it.:(
B00BC254I8|4.0|At the end of this book I felt as if I had just run a long marathon of anguish. This autobiography was not simply depressing or inspiring - it was, at times, everything between those two poles. There are sections where the authors simply delve too far into details of legal proceedings and tales of conquest with women and drugs. I was in my late teens-early 20's during Tyson's reign as heavyweight champion, and he was truly the baddest man on the planet. From the outside looking in, and we were all truly on the outside because this was before the Internet gave unlimited access to sports figures and celebrities, it seemed as if Tyson was dedicated to his craft and reaping the rewards of that dedication. In reality, nothing could have been further from the truth. After winning the title, shortly after the death of Cus D'Amato, Tyson just feasted on the spoils that came with the belt and benefited from an era of weak heavyweights. He admits to letting his commitment to the craft slip.<br /><br />If nothing else, Tyson is a sympathetic protagonist, almost like a flawed comic book hero. The book toys with the reader a bit towards the end, because every time you believe Tyson gets it together and permanently turns his life in a positive direction, he runs off and screws it up again. This is the nature of addiction. Gob bless him in his battle with the demons that haunt him.<br /><br />It is interesting how so many well-known people blatantly used Tyson's fame (infamy?) for their own personal gain, Robin Givens (& her mother) especially. Givens is now re-married, a mother, and probably would defend her actions as pure and true. Don King robbed this man blind. Even Cus D'Amato programmed a young Tyson to be singularly focused on destroying people in and out of the ring. His mental warfare training only added to Tyson's already confused idea or power.<br /><br />In the end, the book was entertaining and definitely worth the time invested.
B0015AARJI|5.0|excellent product is the best I recommend to all the amazon community 100% will love it like me, great: D
B008JFURKG|5.0|I have the first one and could not wait to get the second one.  It is the most enjoyable and funny
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Action packed with a lot of interesting & heartbreaking moments. I really enjoyed the trilogy! I admit I cried at the end.
0143119680|3.0|If I could give this book 3.5 stars, I would.  But there are some serious flaws in the book, so I rounded down for a solid 3.  I think my expectations for this book spoiled me slightly.  I had heard on multiple occasions that this was &#34;Harry Potter for adults&#34;.  I did not find that to be the case at all, and so for the first half of the book I was fighting against what I thought the book should be.  But, once I let go of my expectations, I was able to enjoy the book.<br /><br />The world that Harkness has created is a pretty cool one.  There are three different creatures living in the world among humans: witches, vampires, and daemons.  And, as one would fully expect from a book such as this, a witch and a vampire fall in love. It's not the most original of stories, but it is one that I thoroughly enjoy.  Matthew, the vampire is perfectly dreamy.  Diana's aunts are perfectly witchy.  Diana herself is a bit more of a problem.<br /><br />The book can't seem to decide kind of character Diana should be.  I think the author wanted her to be a strong, capable woman, and its clear that she is going to grow into an all powerful super witch by the end of the series.  But so often Diana is passive and plays the role of damsel in distress.  It doesn't speak well for a character when one of her defining traits through a book is falling asleep.  A little more action from Diana would have gone a long way.<br /><br />That being said, it looks that the rest of the books will explore Diana coming into her power, and she will likely become the key to ending all the conflict between all the creatures in the world.  And, truthfully, I will probably enjoy the hell out of it.  But for a book like this to really rise to the next level, I think something needs to happen that will surprise me.  And I just don't see that happening in the series.<br /><br />I think the story could have lost about a hundred pages and probably would have been better for it.  There was a bit too much meandering in places, and descriptions about things that didn't really matter. Vampire dietary preferences are brought up quite often throughout the book, and in such a way that I really couldn't be less interested.<br /><br />And of course there is the inevitable moment when the vampire needs blood to survive and the love interest selflessly gives up her own blood.  At this point, I probably would have been more impressed if the scene never happened at all.  I understand that it is supposed to make the vampire dangerous and oh no! our heroine might die!  But does anyone really think that is the case?  I found myself bored, tired, and looking forward to moving on.<br /><br />The end of the book finishes on a good note, and my interest in definitely piqued.  I wouldn't call it a cliffhanger exactly, but I believe the future fish out of water possibilities could be incredibly funny.  If Harkness creates more characters like Ysabeau and Em, then the book will be at the very least entertaining.<br /><br />The book as a whole is a pretty solid bit of fantasy, and if the genre interests you, this book should deliver.  There is little to surprise the reader, but it is enjoyable, and sometimes, that is enough.
B004OC07GM|5.0|This is a very key understanding of how innovations become important market forces.  It isn't technology, it is understanding how to weave technology into the marketplace.

B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|Just finish reading this great book. As someone who has worked remotely for the last six years, I certainly did benefit from reading it. For those that have never worked remotely and are considering it, the authors give you all the reasons why you should or should not. In particular I liked the remote management section and the section about making yourself more productive when working remotely.<br /><br />As with the author's other book (Reworked) it was a very easy and enjoyable read that I highly recommend to everyone thinking about or currently working remotely.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Should give us a break after being stuck for days on one level.  So frustrating that we quit!  I have to go back to the beginning and start over to get some satisfaction.  Any other games similar?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read. Ready for the next one!! So political, really. Shows us where we are headed and individuals. Where's the line? How far will &#34;entertainment&#34; go.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|What a fun movie.  I loved the first one and this one didn't disappoint.  I love all the new characters and the fact they they give you the back story to how the main characters met.  Super kid friendly and no hidden messages like in some other kids movies these days.  I recommend it for the whole family.  It's a great movie night choice.  Oh yeah, and my 21 month old daughter likes it too. lol
B00ERH15WY|5.0|We have eclectic tastes in Christmas music, and try to add at least 1 album each year to round out our (extensive) collection.<br /><br />This is a great addition! It will be perfect mixed with more conventional takes on many of the classic carols, or as a part of a really high-energy mix. It sounds like everyone involved was really enjoying themselves!
B00EAI9CSY|3.0|It was a good story that was well acted by most all actors.  You can't understand the young boyfriend of the girl and he played his character too strange to be believeable, making him hard to watch.  I've seen him in other movies where I've really enjoyed his ability to create strange, facinating characters, but this one was not fitting.  The story lines were a bit weak for reaons I can't put my finger on, so 3 stars.  Worth the rental and the time though.
1449430295|5.0|Looks like the perfect gift for my engineer son...  He'll enjoy it on his desk at work, as will his co-workers!
0307474259|4.0|This book is pretty helpful for aspiring biochem students. As a young student, I'm looking for all kinds of information - from textbooks, journals, and non-fiction alike. This was an easy read (Only took 1 week 1 hour a day.) I just have one little observation - there is much controversy over these topics. He has a great philosophy and puts good science in this book, but don't take his word as gospel. Keep informed and read other books! Read sources that disagree with these statements.<br /><br />So I won't say this book is perfect, but definitely helps shine light on the subject of weight loss in this &#34;fad-ridden&#34; society we live in. Be objective.
B004HD2ZK4|5.0|A desert island disk if ever there were such a thing. For years I have been listening to this and it is one of the very few albums that is so rich I am continually discovering new things in the texture of the songs. Beautiful and glorious.<br />I, too, cannot understand why more people don't know this album.<br />Good enough then: this will be my secret island retreat--my high volume getaway with headphones on, lost in the music.  With streaming etc, you don't have to buy music these days--and yet this may be one album that is truly worth owning .  Ignore the comparisons.  Nothing else really comes close.  I'm buying a fresh copy tonight. Why? I don't know except to say that I'm utterly addicted.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Great movie. Love the book, read it at least 15 times. I had high expectations for this movie. I will say that it did not let me down, however I feel that people that did not have a connection with the book first might not see the brilliance of this movie. It was made for the fans.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This was so cool- and surprisingly LARGER than expected.  I'd read the reviews and some folks thought it was smaller than what they'd expected but I guess a person just has diff expectations.  Grandson was THRILLED with it and I see that its going to get a lot of use and that makes Grandma happy to have picked a WINNER!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love this app. It's the only one I know of that just lets you load and fire all these guns. My great grandpa was a gunnery sargent ( sorry but I don't quite know how to spell it ) in world war ll and I think that he might have used some of these guns.

B00AZMFJYA|4.0|It was good, but not quite as good as the first one.  I still can't accept the guy they chose to portray Scottie though.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This is way better then the first one. Had major problems with the first one but so<br />far this one is pretty good. Since it has a story then the first one.

B008JFUR10|3.0|Great special effects low on plot. Great for reading a book while watching. Nothing more to say so quit telling me to ad  more.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed this book greatly. Problem is, is that I read it after the movie came out, and so I was trying to watch the movie after reading the book and I couldn't handle it since it's SO different. I liked the book much more, and though the movie received rave reviews and was highly recommended to me, I couldn't get through half of it from the disparities. Once again the &#34;the book was better!&#34; badness (goodness?) strikes again.

B00138J7V6|5.0|I love this artist and his sound. I enjoy this CD every day. I'm so glad I bought it and you will be too.
0062238868|5.0|Excellent first person account of Iraq fighting. Kyle's gung-ho but enlisted man viewpoint makes for a proud and unapologetic story. This may offend the sensitive peaceniks out there, but the inclusion of his wife's reactions to the hardships of the military lifestyle gives the book a certain amount of &#34;counterpoint&#34;. The large type is easy on the eyes.
006202406X|3.0|I agree with most of the other reviewers and while I enjoyed the first two books in the series, this last installment was disappointing.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />It would have been more surprising and satisfying if Caleb had finally demonstrated his love for his sister.  While Tris was shot in the Weapon's Room, it would have been great if Caleb had come to her rescue and actually saved his sister.  I find that both Tris and Tobias are reunited with at least one parent at the end of the series -- Tris in death with her mother, Natalie, who was an interesting character on her own, and Tobias with his mother Evelyn, who had much too quick a change of heart at the end of the book. Where does that leave the couple -- torn apart and alone.  Tobias seems to lose the most out of all of the characters as he has to find a way to live on without Tris after he has finally found someone who loves him and wants to be with him.  I also wanted to love Allegiant, but just couldn't reconcile the ending.  Yes, war is terrible and tragic, but did Allegiant have to be so tragic, too? Couldn't the readers have had a satisfying ending where the two main characters had a chance at a happy ending after all the suffering and betrayal they had already experienced at such a young age?  I guess we will never find out why Tris was resistant to all the serums and what her offspring would have offered.  The story is over but doesn't provide closure.

0393088804|2.0|It is more of a picture book- with little explanation of the battle. It was a major disappointment when I opened the book.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|The exquisite rendering of familial relationships in this book is haunting. It stayed with me for so long that I had to read it again. It was even better the second time!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The characters of this book grow and unfold right up to the end.  They challenge you to even like them, but you will.  They are so open with their thought processes. How would you handle life if you were living in that future world ?  Yes, that could be your future .  Be Brave .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept me wanting to come back to the book every day...I read it fast!  Book two should be a good one.

B004GJXQ20|5.0|A real &#34;can't-put-it-down&#34; modern day fairytale. The book absolutely outshines the TV series and takes you to a medaevil time of dragons.  A must to read all of the series

B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Not my usual cup of tea, I'll admit, but it didn't take long to hook me in, and once that happened I couldn't put it down. There are no wasted words in Luca Rossi's story-spinning, and the variety of concepts and executions in this collection is simply staggering. The author creates convincing characters and fills the tales with the right mix of action, sex, violence, social commentary, melancholy and love. Never dull, always different. All in all a fantastic escapist read. Thoroughly recommended.
B00EVQU1VM|5.0|Giving a book a 1 star rating because you bought it on accident is foolish and quite dumb. I feel people should have to take an IQ test to write reviews.

I have 2 DSLR one with a long lens when I was using the harness. other than the low quality material they use, I would have given it higher marks! since its no excuse that I only use it on 2 occasion. the items is like brand new when it fail on me.

0439813786|4.0|This is my first book that Brian Selznick has written. He usually write illustrations in books. To give an example, &#34;Frindle&#34; is a bood by Andrew Clements and illustrations are by Mr.Selznick. This was a book using his especiality, illustraitons.<br /><br /> This story is expressed in words and illustrations. So when you see the number of pages of this book, don't imagine a very long  book, hard to read. More than a quater of this book is pictures. The story is a boy named Hugo Cabret trying to make an automaton that his father had left when he died. But the notebook that tells how to make it is taken away from him by a man. So he tries to take it back............ This story is some kind of a mystery. The connection between the automaton and the man and Hugo lights up slowly. There are scenes that you think &#34;Whats up here?&#34; and when it is explained you feel satisfied. Some of the pictures are impossible to understand. This makes the story more mysteriouse and make force you to read ahead. You can feel the emotions Hugo feel in the story. If you are a child you can relate yourself to him, and if you are an adult, you can go back to your past in your childhood trying to accomplish your dream.<br /><br /> The pictures make the story more fun to read. The artistic variety of the pictures is awesome. But these pictures make the book not feel like reading a good book. I think I would have liked it without pictures. Though without the pictures this book can not be a good book.<br /><br />I'll recommend it to people who like reading books with pictures. This has a whole 300 pages of it! If anyone know another &#34;novel&#34; by Mr.Selznick, tell me.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is awesome sauce because it never glitchs or freeze witch is the same thing as glitching .Also  it never gets old because you can update it on characters or other things.Well that's why you should get minion rush.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the FIRST game..in all the apps I've ever downloaded, that I was able to continuously play without getting the slightest bit bored. It's so addicting and funny.

B009AMAGQM|5.0|My two cents is to say that I've never read the books but really enjoyed the movie, especially the acting of Alden Ehrenreich. I thought the movie was nicely paced, I was never confused about the plot, the characters were lovable. I find it silly that one should expect a movie to copy the book. The fact of the matter is that works are best viewed autonomously--the author of the book had her vision of the story and the director has the right to re-invision that work for another medium. That's why the True Blood series works so well independently of the Sookie Stackhouse series that inspired it. Shame on some of you for trying to control what can or can't be created!<br /><br />I think that if the movie can be faulted, maybe it doesn't go far enough. The movie gets very adult sometimes but then every so often becomes a bit too childlike. I hope they take a chance and make a second film because it was very enjoyable. I'm going to try hard to recruit as many of my friends as possible to watch it.

B0015DWLD0|4.0|In Luxemburg, India, otherwise known as the “darkness” a man is raised into a life of poverty as in the caste of “sweet makers”.  He uses all of the knowledge he acquired over the years to rise above his caste and becomes a driver for a wealthy landlord’s son and moves to the big city of Delhi.  If you enjoy mystery, adventure and historical fiction, then I would highly recommend this book.  It will grip you from the moment you start reading as Balram Halwai takes you on his life journey of despair, hope, wealth and eventual self destruction.  The book is set just before modern day times after Ghandi is elected and is trying to help eliminate the horrible living conditions of the people in lower classes or castes.  The pages start turning faster as you go deeper into Balrams story.  His heartbreaking description of his father’s life and death as a rickshaw puller keeps the reader interested in continuing.<br /> This book grips you with mystery, secrets, and misery.  One example of mystery is how the wealthy landlords earn money taking large sums of money from multiple banks on a daily basis leaving the reader wondering who, what, where and why.  Mr. Ashok never discloses what he does for a living.  Balram starts collecting secrets from the moment he becomes acquainted with the Ashok family.  His never misses a conversation or forgets an event.  His working relationship started off as a lie stating that he was not a drinker or interested in women or money.  He also lied about his driving experience.  Misery is described throughout the entire novel.  Balrams living conditions with hundreds upon hundreds of cockroaches and mosquitoes left the reader gagging.  He could hear the roaches gnawing away at the baseboards every night while he slept under a net.  He lived on mouse like portions of food and tiny sums of rupees and went hungry most days trying to satisfy his hunger chewing paan.  The endless hours of waiting for his master at the mall with his wife or girlfriendis painful to read.  The stories from the other drivers of horrible living conditions, murder, betrayal, and death were the only things to lead him away from complete boredom. The magazine Murder Weekly was the only form of entertainment as the drivers passed it around.  The camaraderie among the drivers was the only sense of joy the reader will experience. They shared, they experimented and they would always try to help one another and they had each other’s back.  They were always hoping that one of their “brothers” would make something of themselves someday.<br /> If you would like to learn more about the economic conditions in India including the exploitation of the labor force by foreign corporations, then this book will satisfy your curiosity.  The American corporations moving in and setting up call centers will shock you.  The extreme gap between the poor and the wealthy people of India and their strange caste system makes this book a very entertaining read.

0525478817|5.0|There must have been some major keyboard mishap wherever this was published, because this was written by Holt McDougal, not this John Green guy. Holt astounds with this novel about the struggle to love in a life destined to end and he composes a symphony tugging on our heart strings. I have never been to a book signing before, but with such a masterfully written piece, I feel obligated to get the signature McSquiqqle. Hats off, a book that I assure you will all McDig.
0804161380|3.0|This box limited set was advertised specifically as having a hand-written signature from Aonuma, which is the entire reason I bought this. The signature turns out to be shoddily printed on a sheet of paper.<br /><br />It may seem silly to assume it would be a real signature, but I've bought limited items that has releases of 100,000 or 150,000 (this set is limited to only 50,000) and STILL had real signatures.<br /><br />Extremely disappointed to see this cheaply printed &#34;signature&#34;. As a fan, I feel insulted by the purposely vague false advertising.<br />I'm looking to get a refund.<br /><br />Outside of this major issue, the set itself is nice. The books are well put together and the bookmark is very solid.

B00DBO1YMK|5.0|The music on this album is so beautiful! Even the quick, upbeat, light, and happy songs are so soothing!! I bought this album and started listening to it during my college finals this week and it has helped me to be calmer and less stressed after studying and shortly before finals! I just want to play this in my house and waltz around while I decorate and wrap gifts! and they weren't stingy with the music! There weren't just like 10 or 11 songs, there are 16!! :D You won't regret buying this CD! :)

B004XVN1T4|3.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors.  One of my all time favorite book's is &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;. If you pick up a Ken Follett book, you will have an enjoyable read.  Triple is an enjoyable read, but it is not one of Ken Follett's best books though.  The book opens at a party in London, after World War 2.  And all of the people at that party turns into spy's for their different countries, or are Mafia Dons.  The plot is unbelievable, and the action is not up to Ken Follett level.  I would recommend many other Ken Follett books before this one, but you would not be disappointed if you read it.
B00FPH6A70|4.0|had a gimmicky plot, but the &#34;BOO&#34; moments just kept on coming - loved the adrenalin rush - acting, often puzzling reactions - FX pretty good - depiction of witches as Satan worshipers was a turnoff

B00BAXFCPO|4.0|The book is an interesting perspective/study on a healthy brain.  We read so much about grains and how good grains are for a healthy colon and helping to lower cholesterol.  Perlmutter gives the reader information on how carbs, sugars, and gluten (grains) contribute to an unhealthy brain.  There is much scientific information to sift through but necessary to help the reader understand how carbs, sugar, and gluten affect the brain.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is such an intense workout. I recommend this to anyone and everyone. I loved it so much that I ordered one for my mom and for my friend. They both love it too!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|If I'd had any idea of how this whole thing would end I'd never have picked up the first book.  I really wanted to love this book... I went through chapter after chapter of Tris/Four (wait who's narrating right now?) droning on and on about nothing worth remembering all to be completely disappointed.  By the time the book ended with it's awful sad ending I couldn't even care enough to be mad.  All the end got was a big eye roll.  Waste of money.  Seriously - don't bother.
0307951529|5.0|So many concrete, great ideas. If you've got an idea for a product or service, this will help you get it off the ground or increase exposure and sales!
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|This game was enjoyable. Great graphics. Storyline was simple. There are six levels that are not short.  Within each realm (level) you go back and forth between different scenes, they number how many items to look for. There are lists of hidden objects, gold coins to find, point and click items in the scenes to collect. And worked perfectly on my kindle fire hd 8.9 previous generation.
B00005MP58|5.0|Great love story and Colin Firth does it so well! Have seen other iterations, but his is the best to me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft for the tablet is awesome!  Don't waste your money on cheap knock offs (tried several of them). If you enjoy MC on your pc then this is a great way to have it on the go. I love having the ability to play while I'm at lunch or sitting at the doctor's office. It is also a great way to keep the kids quite while on a trip.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The novel in my opinion was Grisham's best.  I commute from New  York to Long Island each day and read the novel on the Long Island Rail Road . I was so consumed by  the narrative that I missed my get off  stop on the railroad on two separate occasions . I had to take a cab to get back to the location where my car was located and guess what , while traveling in the cab  I continued to read the novel,  that's how interested I was in the story.<br />  The story starting from the hanging until the very ending continued to build from one segment to another.  Each of the main characters of the story all added to the narrative and the author created from his words emotions in me that were fueled by the authors words.  My feeling evolved depending upon the narrative .<br />  Lets put it this way , now that I have finished reading the novel I am both happy and  a little sad.  Happy to have read such a fine work but sad that I can not continue reading it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The work of John Grisham reminds one of why the Thriller genre used to be a favorite!<br />The story and characters were like a warm familiar blanket of rich detail. You never get the impression Grisham is trying to fix the characters he built before, no, he just stopped by for a visit, and here is what they were up to.<br />Maybe other readers wanted more development of ancillary characters, still, we were introduced to some interesting new ones, and given another nice slice of 1980's Mississipi.<br />The writing style is consistent and overall very pleasing
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm soo glad that candy crush has finally come to the kindle!!! I have been waiting for this for a long time!! It's a lot nicer playing it on a bigger screen than my galaxy3!
B000T9OP7G|4.0|The first season the better of the two. At first I didn't think the character named 'Cameron' (must be named after movie creator James 'Cameron') - but she did a Great job!!<br />I say a bit thinner on special effects - than the Terminator movies.<br />My concerns - are mostly about it turned a bit too much into (attempts) at more emotional drama - than an intense action TV show.<br />The 2nd season - even more so. Still - I never understood why it was either canceled or not picked up for season 3??<br />Some interesting twists. I don't give five stars easily.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Enjoyed reading, good descriptions for the mind to imagine, but should have quit reading - and just about did quit when she said &#34;I am a writer&#34;, somewhere along the way - which spoiled it for me. Otherwise enjoyed most of it.  Do I believe it?  Only some of it.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really loved this book! It kept my interest throughout the entire story. The characters were great. I couldn't put it down.
B004LROUW2|5.0|From the other reviews I've read, it seems like a consensus is that this not Murakami's best work. Because this is my first time reading something of his, I can't compare it to what he has written, but I can say that 1Q84 grabbed me, pulled me in, and wouldn't let go.<br /><br />Background: I've lived in Japan for a couple of years and know the language, and I feel the translators did an excellent job conveying this as it was written in the original Japanese. The feeling of the words, the pacing, even the puns [1984 in Japanese is ichi ku (hence the Q) hachi yon] are faithfully reproduced in the English text, though I do feel that without this additional background I've had, I could see it falling flat. It also helped me that so many of the places - Azabu, Koenji, Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Sangenjaya - were all places that I'm intimately familiar with, having biked those streets time and time again while I lived there.<br /><br />The story: You aren't in need of a recap, or even an initial summary, there are lots of those. However, with this book it does take its time to get where its going. It's not a book that will be rushed. Instead, the deliberate pacing draws our two heroes together in a slowly tightening circle. If you're expecting a quick cross country trip on I-40, you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting a scenic, rich, leisurely journey along Route 66, you'll be richly rewarded. This is close to 1000 pages of the best that Japan offers, and it is well worth the read.<br /><br />Stories within stories and repetition: One of the hallmarks of 1Q84 is that it has several sub stories that Murakami wrote and inserted in the text. Sometimes they're mentioned in bits and spurts, other times you get what is (essentially) the whole story. Both these works are integral to the protagonists' world views. Throughout the text, there is an ongoing repetition of several instances involving both protagonists. While some may feel that they are unnecessary padding, I feel that they are essential to understanding the characters and what their pasts and motivations are, without adding additional exposition. They're vague enough to allow the reader their view, but concrete enough that Murakami gives us a direction to travel.<br /><br />Loose ends: I've seen some complain about loose ends in the novel, and while there certainly are some - I would love to see what happened with the dowager and Tamura - I feel that it wraps up in a very satisfying manner and in such a way that there are no &#34;loose ends&#34; in the core of the story.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is well-written, suspenseful, and contains plenty if twists and turns. I cannot wait to see the next movies based on it.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|fun and challenging brings me back to my school days playing at lunch with friends. I just wish it had some of the older cards in it.
B00DJZR46G|3.0|Okay EJ.
1455576387|3.0|I decided to start this series noting it's not as well rated as most I've already read.  Unfortunately, there are so many characters I spent much of my time trying to figure out who was who and from where they came.  It was a good premise, but very hard to follow.<br />Hopefully the next will be just a bit more easy to follow.
B000AGTPUK|2.0|What a wierd, lifeless, uncomfortable and depressing movie this is.  The whole thing has a feeling of menace that seems to be always lurking just beneath the surface.  Tom Hanks annoyingly provides the voice for many of the film's characters.  I do like Tom as an actor, but he's just totally wrong for this movie entirely.  The Conductor - annoying, over the top and kind of creepy.  The little know-it-all kid with glasses - also extremely annoying.  This is that \\"special\\"  kind of character that - if this were any other movie - you know would get his comeuppance before the credits rolled (instead he just gets a little \\"talking to\\" from Santa).  And speaking of Santa - I'll just put it this way, I woudn't want MY kids sitting in this Santa's lap.  The pitch effect used to lower Hanks' voice is just too surreal for words.  The Hobo - annoying and kind of dark, but I guess he's supposed to be so we'll let him off the hook.  And those menacing elves, you just can't tell if they're going to give you a big christmas hug or jump up and eat your face off.  All the scenes in the deserted areas of the north pole with the distant echo-y sounding Christmas music that plays in the background... It's like something out of a horror movie and it's utterly dark and depressing.  And who in their right mind would have put those two mentally challenged \\"engineers\\" in charge of operating this train??  Laws of physics?  Suspension of disbelief? Forget about them completely.  The reality train pulled out of the station sometime after last new years.  You've heard the saying \\"check your brain at the door\\"?  Well forget that too.  You need to go ahead and send your brain on vacation a good 2 weeks before you even try and watch this thing.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love these kinds of games. Usually when it's free you only get limited stuff, but so far everything is awesome! (:
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|If you like Paul you will like this album.  Nice to have some new music from old favorites, Thank you.
B0053TMP24|5.0|great book by rick riordon. filled with action and adventure.another great percy jackson book.very adventurous. GREAT BOOK AMAZINGread it. cheap.five star kind of book rating
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Piano Guys have done it again!!  Christmas music has never sounded more delightful.  I love the arrangements and the inspiring feel of the piano and cello combination. You can just hear and feel their passion for music. I think I can actually feel Steven Sharp Nelson smile in the music. I've never seen a happier person!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|good movie quality and cheap and quick delivered we enjoy the film very much I recorded thanks a lot by one to see at home.
B008JDAC7G|5.0|Let me get this out of the way first.<br /><br />THERE ARE NO PRIVACY OR SECURITY ISSUES WITH THIS GAME.<br />NONE, ZILCH, ZERO, NADA. NOTHING.<br /><br />There are no ads, no tracking, no collection.<br />The other people stating this have no clue what they are talking about since they seem to have no idea what permissions do or are used for.<br />Used TrustGo Ad Detector, Lookout Ad Detector, Lookout Antivirus, Privacy Blocker(use Privacy Inspector yourself, it's a free scanner) I challenge anyone to find an honest app that detects any adware or spyware in this app and post a comment.<br /><br />I have installed and run the Amazon version and the free version on Google Play. Neither one has any issues. But guess what the GP version has? IAP! And you people seem to hate IAP. (it is used for cosmetic items as far as I could tell, and you can grind for those items easily) The free version in Google is also a different play style and even has a different name: Super MAMC. The paid GP version is just like this one in Amazon. Any who compare the 2 have obviously not played them both since they do not actually mention anything about this.<br />Also, THEY BOTH HAVE THE .SAME. .EXACT. .PERMISSIONS.<br />Edit2: I take this back, Super has 1 more perm. com.android.vendor.BILLING .. because it has IAP.<br /><br />************<br />I am using a Galaxy S2, Sprint version with Android 4.1.2 on wifi only.<br />The game itself is easy and enjoyable enough. I wont retype it all here, just read the other positive and real reviews below. I was playing Star Trek Online and stopped for a break to wait for something and ended up spending an hour playing MAMC. It is not a serious game. None of the Adult Swim games are. They are just enjoyable, addicting time killers as most phone games are.<br /><br />Edit1: Added in the apps I used to scan it and my device used.<br />Edit2: Added Addons Detector and Pocket Permissions to my list. neither show anything worrisome. Still No Spyware, No Adware, No Analytics Software At All.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a great book. It grabs you and pulls you right in.  Be prepared for some tears....it will surprise you
B00498YZFK|4.0|This was a very tough story but is well worth the watch.  It is well directed and acted with a good story.  Jennifer Lawrence is spectacular.
1439153663|1.0|I wasn't really impressed with this book.  It is supposedly similar to UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS but I did not find that the case.  It was sort of a very-watered down rendition!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I never review books but this trilogy was so good I feel I must. After seeing both films I feel they had sooo much potential given the books were great, but the film adaptations really cannot compare. The second and third books were my favorite although I constantly lost track of the characters.<br /> I've never hated a main character so much, a few times I had to laugh at myself for getting so angry over how naive this teenager was until the very last chapters. From the very beginning Peeta was the most interesting character and his shift in dynamic in the third books is truly brilliant. A lot of the story is highly predictable but in a way that keeps you begging for more. I read this trilogy in less than 3 days and it was well worth it.
B001EC2IV2|5.0|Classic, great action and light humor. Weapons are still cutting edge. Supporting cast is above par. Just showed my 16 year old son he loved it.
B0029VUV70|4.0|What a fascinating story.  I was intrigued from the start and was happy we rented it.  It is a compelling story of love from one side and need from another.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|A great movie.  I had seen the original and I was surprised that the remake really was just as good.
B00F2362IE|1.0|If you have the Fire 2nd gen forget about it.  Will not load. The resources required outstrip the device`s ability to run it.
B008JFUUIA|1.0|I should have known that my relationship with my now ex was doomed the second she brought this movie over. This movie lacks any real acting, dialogue, or clever humor. The jokes range from juvenile to infantile, there is nothing likable about any of the characters (mostly because they are one dimensional) , and the singing sounds artificial. My ex laughed hard at some of the jokes, I haven;t laughed at those kind of jokes since I started developing acne. When will we be saved from the horror that is autotune and delivered back in to real musical territory? Not while trash like this is around.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|I thought I would like the revised version of this movie as this series of movies made a big impression on me and my friends in high school.  Too bad they screwed with it.  As for this format, it is what I expected it to be.+
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of my favorite shows on television. It is truly a must watch. Action-packed, drama-filled, and a suspenseful story combined for great entertainment. I have hung in there since Season 1 and plan to keep watching. Each season keeps getting better.
B0042816YK|5.0|I love this movie, it really resonated with me during a difficult time and I continue to watch it from time to time to remind myself of the strength we all have within us.
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|It was a fun movie, we enjoyed it. It was what I expected from Pixar and Disney as a franchise effort.
B0055EAJ7A|3.0|Bought the movie for our new 3D TV.  The 3D effects are great but were only mildly enthused about the movie.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Extremely predictable, several witty references to characters played by the actors in other movies.  Plenty of things blowing up to be entertaining for awhile, but not much plot and even less suspense.  Frequently hard to suspend one's disbelief.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the series, disappointed in the abrupt ending.  Loved the characters and love the kindle edition.  So easy to download and read!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|an okay story with a clean visual presence. Neither good or bad but just &#34;meh&#34;. Brought to you by the Tome Cruise style of movie making: fast, clean, under-budget with a little story thrown in for effect.
B0002I831S|5.0|Bought this for my son who is a bit of a geek!  He loves it and watches it with friends all the time!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys have done it again!  I love, love love this CD.  I also have their other two and listen to them so much that when my 4 y/o son first heard me listening to this one he asked if it was The Piano Guys.  I told him that it was and he said, &#34;Those are my favorite guys.&#34;  Thanks, Piano Guys, you are amazing!!
B00BHMETKC|2.0|man you can literally hear Hollywood patting itself on the back in this movie.<br /><br />Technically, it's a good movie. Good shots, well paced, does a good job with showing a complicated idea and issue into an exciting thriller. EXCEPT ALMOST NONE OF IT HAPPENED THAT WAY IN REAL LIFE.<br /><br />They got the basic frame of the story and then jazzed it up with typical Hollywood hoopla. I wasn't thrilled that they whitewashed the main character (growing a beard does not make you Hispanic, Affleck), but fine, that's Hollywood. It's irritating though, especially *Spoiler alert after this* at the end where we have the \\"big scary bearded\\" Iranian police smelling a rat in their identities. BUT WAIT! It's up to Hollywood, (again) to save them by covering for them when the police call the main characters production company. Arrgh. Oh, and Affleck has to tell the policemen the plot of their fake!movie which is a pretty much direct rip off of Star Wars and the movie really hammers in the Iranian's emotional connection to a story of an oppressed (gasp) people who rose up and overthrew their evil overlord. JUST LIKE YOUR SHAH!!11 DO YOU GET IT? Super frustrated when I looked up how things really went down and it turned out that they left the country without incident, first of all. Plus they skipped over completely on the team that wrote the script (awesome legends like Ray Bradbury btw) and instead of ~*dramatic tension*~ shots of an angry mob of Iranians pounding on the nice white CIA agent's van, I would have preferred to see more about how those guys actually worked their butts off to make the Argo production a success.<br /><br />Oh well. It made money, it won the oscar. You'll enjoy it if you turn your brain off and just want an high-quality produced popcorn movie. As for me, personally, I thought the actual events were a lot more exciting and interesting and this film doesn't do those people's lives justice. Guess I'll just read the book.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|I really liked this movie. The pacing was good, the visual effects were fantastic, and the storyline had a more visceral feel to it. In this version of Superman we see what it might actually have been like for an alien to grow up on earth, forced to hide his godlike powers. In the end we see what happens when gods do battle amongst mortals (collateral damage was spectacular). I was so impressed with the SF/X (way to go animation-f/x artists) I had to watch the movie twice. There are so many layers to this movie that I could probably write several more paragraphs, most of which are about the design and theory behind Kryptonian technology and eugenics.
B003ZUTVJS|1.0|My wife wanted to see this one.  I did not like it at all.  Weird story with mediocre acting and directing.
1587143879|5.0|This book has great reading material and helps you understand the material in a more realistic picture.  This helps you absorb the information more as oppossed to just memorizing it.  Although, with the amount of material you need to know to pass the test, memorization will always be a factor as well.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Oh, i just loved this book. Shows how life can always be an adventure no matter what your age, if you just take the initiative to keep taking chances
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am perpetually dismayed at Mr. Martin's disregard for the traditional &#34;good guys prevail in the end&#34; element in story telling, but then this isn't a bedtime story. The complex web of characters is amazing! The story has so much history and depth, it is a whole world. I am impressed with that. Sure I get mad at Mr. Martin for mistreating my favorite characters but I can never put the books down. I am on book five now. I think I will fall into a depression when the series is done.
B0043EV774|3.0|Saw this one in the theater adn thought it was a good story.  Bought this version to play on the new #D TV.  Looks great in #D.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|I just want to make this review short and simple. NIKITA (all three seasons) is one of the best action tv-series. It is fast moving of the script, no lows through out each episode and usually one story per episode. All episodes are having so much fun to watch as the action does not stop. beautiful and handsome characters, lots scenery shots. The story isn't too bad at all for the action shows.I watched all three seasons on Netflix and couldn't wait for the 4th season.
B00555X8OA|4.0|Readable, but interesting information on research about how we think. Just the right smattering of evidence based on his experiments (which are actually quite entertaining and even ask for reader interaction) to demonstrate his ideas.
B00EJYGL8S|4.0|I LOVE The Piano Guys, and they exceeded my expectations with this album, I already owned two songs (We Three Kings and Oh Come Oh Come Emmanuel) which was a bit sad, seeing as you cant pick and choose songs haha, and those were released last year, which is why its only 4 stars. But I have already listened to this album about 20 times this christmas season, and have  no doubts I will be listening to it about a thousand more times!
B000W796OM|5.0|This is my favorite of the Harry Potter series.  True to the book.  Well directed and acted with impressive visuals.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|A good drama that dealt with the internal struggle with alcoholism.  Overall i would recommend for someone who likes other Denzel Washington movies.
B004LROUW2|3.0|Not up to his usual standard.Too long by far.Maybe not a good idea to read the three books back to back.Having said that,still a big fan of him.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|An app for the old school dogfighters.<br />Decent graphics and sound effects considering its free.<br />Every fighter you could think of.
B001O6W9QC|1.0|I must say that I had high hopes for this movie.  It is, unfortunately, terrible.  Poor acting and a terrible story.  I expected much better from the people associated with this.
0374158460|1.0|Not  for me  his  long  history  of  a  pimp  and  a cuckold,  with  minor  pimps  and hobos. I don' t understand  the  comparison  with Tolstoi. Very boresome. Only  &#34;Walter&#34;  has  a breeze  of  life... all the  rest  is  dead.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I don't see myself getting sick of any of these songs--not even Let It Snow!! Beautiful--and as always, uber-creative arrangements. Was thrilled to find out I not only get the CD/DVD, but also an instant digital (MP3) download. Great stuff, guys!
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book was very relatable and enjoyable, brought me to tears on several occasions. I would recommend this to anyone who likes books about finding oneself.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|This film is much better than the 2 previous installments of this series.  A superior adaption of the actual book and a pleasure to watch.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is one of the absolute best books on the subject. Mike is amazing and knowledgeable a well as well researched. It took me literally years of researching to discover the information in this book for myself. I can tell you from personal experience that what Mike presents here is genuine, although not the quick fix so many people think exist. Do yourself a favor and get this book! I am very anxiously awaiting the next book.
B00E8B1358|4.0|The Rock carried the movie well after the departure of you-know-who (sigh), but I found the introducing of &#34;original Joe&#34; very entertaining. I wish this movie had developed his character a little more. That silly sot Jaye, they could have left her out of the movie (or at least leave out the cheap shots), all sob story there. Jonathan Pryce just reminded me of his old infinity commercials, haha, but made for a good enough president. And Imhotep! I mean... Zartan! He is a good looking man, and I would have like to see more of him (did you know he was also in &#34;Hard Target&#34; with Van Damme?). A film to watch when you want to let your brain rot a little (I mean this with the utmost respect, I did pay for it, after all). I think this movie is a little over-priced at $4.99 in the Amazon Instant Video, but what else can you do for $4.99? A fun flick, end of story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really addictive candy game lots of fun and cute graphics take your time to plot your moves when the game gets intense or you will be ask friends for help!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|White Fire is an amazing read on so many levels. If you have read Still Life with Crow, you will want to pick up this book right away. White Fire is Corrie Swanson s story. This character was first introduced in Still Life. This is a first class thriller with many twists and turns.  Preston and Child are masters a making you fall in love with their characters. Their voices seamless unit to tell their tales with authenticity. I always feel I am on location with their characters. I love all the Pendergast novels. If this is your first Pendergrast read, I am confident that you will want to read them all. Thanks for a great read, I only regret THAT  it is finished and I have to wait for a the next one.
B004Q3RKH8|4.0|I liked their first two albums more than this, but I still consider this a very good album especially when compared to No Code.  It has the hits Not For You and Betterman.  If you like this band then you will probably like this album.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Judy Dench is a fantastic M, who has a great looking apartment by the way (I expected it to look more austere, for some reason). Javier Bardem plays a fantastic creepoid, funny at times, and with many tricks up his sleeve. Reminiscent of previous, cheekier Bond villains. Severine makes for a good Bond-woman (nay girl) with some nice fingernails. Stylish cinematography. Now I wish I had a home in the Scottish highlands! Much more engaging, I think, than Quantum of Solace.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Colorful landscapes and uniquely different puzzles each time make this a fun game, it may be difficult for really young kids, but teaches great visual skills. Try this game you will enjoy it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book the first time I read it when it was newly minted like a half dollar.  After recently finishing Doctor Sleep I was hungry for more Stephen King.  Since this year marks  the fiftieth anniversary of the Kennedy Assasination, 11/22/63  sprung to mind.<br /><br />As with most of King`s  stuff,  the storytelling is exquisite and gripping.
B0000029AP|5.0|Here is the album that made Aerosmith one of the best bands of the 70's.  It has the hits Sweet Emotion and Walk This Way.  Good from start to finish.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This is a terrible game. It's free but you can't get through the levels without buying something. Not worth my money!!
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|This is a great book if your into war books and just military stuff in general, it makes you feel proud to be living here in America. And to know there was someone like Chris Kyle out there who truly care about our great nation.
6305428042|5.0|I love the actors and actresses in this movie.  And the plot is fun with a great Halloween subject!  I love Bette!
B000002UAR|5.0|This album marked the beginning of a whole new chapter of psychedelic rock for the band.  It is one of those albums that is good from start to finish, and it only gets better from here.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is a fun game have had a great time playing to pass the time away in the deer stand
B00FR0GT9Y|2.0|This could have been so much more. Yes the Boston sound is there but some elements need to go. Sorry but no lead female vocals and please use a live drummer. Your live show is incredible so why not capture that live sound. Boston has always cared little about what the record company wanted but I'm starting to wonder if Tom cares what most of the fans want. Just my opinion. Some people will like it and others will be very disappointed. I'm in the very disappointed camp.<br /><br />I'm back and have listened to the CD five times through. It has grown on me a little but still would not have included the female vocals. They just don't fit on a Boston recording!! I'm willing to bet they will sound great live.<br /><br />Back again......I really want to like this recording so I'm at about listen #12 and it has gotten much better. Still want the female vocals gone and the production needs a lot of work. I thought if I played it really loud that it would sound better but it actually sounds worse. I'm starting to wish the record company was involved because I have no idea what Frontier records was doing when they released this. They must have let Tom have full control because they should be embarrassed that they released this recording with this kind of production. Sorry but it really is that bad!!!<br /><br />Remember how \\" The Launch \\" made you feel as it blew into \\" Cool the Engines \\" I'm just not getting that sonic rush at all. How about the massive organ solos that would usher in a kickin song and have you ready to drive your car about 100 mph. The song \\" Walk On \\" did that for me. Not here. This CD has a ton of potential. I just don't know where Tom's head and ears were at.
B00BXHLM1K|5.0|Loved it! Zeljko lucic is one of the best Rigolettos that I have seen and heard. I enjoyed the modern setting although it put me off at first.
B0015NORBO|5.0|This is one of the great psychedelic albums of 67.  It is up there with The Doors, Sgt. Pepper and Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  Standout tracks are Venus in Furs and I'm Waiting for my Man.  I got this album knowing nothing about the band from a Rolling Stone review and I was not dissappointed.  If you like psychedelic rock, get this album.
B00ERP55NQ|3.0|Ok hard to get around and find locations  keep starting me out I. Different place seem to kick me off wish could zoom in closer
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love all the tracks and so do my siblings! Everything was a treat to listen to. I hope that they do another in the future!
1878424750|5.0|I've literally listened to this hundreds of times every night while I am going to sleep.  Five stars all the way!
B000VXCZWW|5.0|Most people probably think of Stevie Nicks when they think Fleetwood Mac.  However there was life in this band years before she joined.  His name was Peter Green.  He was in the band from 67 to 70.  This album was his finest hour.  It has the hit Oh Well.  He also wrote Black Magic Woman which was a hit for Santana.  If you like slow bluesy psychedelic rock then you may like this. Peter Green may very well be the most underrated guitar player of the late 60's.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I bought this about a month ago, and I'm still listening to it on loop on my phone! The lyrics are deep, and the music is amazing! I definitely recommend it as a gift for the holidays.
B00GPE9HEA|1.0|Wow, this is so disappointing!  Everything that has already been done in dance music is repeated here, yet again!  I was bored with the title, but I overlooked that, kinda like the don't judge a book mentality, but it was the truth!  Her voice, while not great, is mutated here.  I got to the song with Jamie Lynn, and thought that this would've been a better album had she sung it, because it is her voice you hear, not auto tune!  The only bright spots are Alien, and Tik Tik Boom, that's it, sadly.
B001GCUER0|4.0|As in Season One, this series keeps you coming back. The disturbing social realities of the burgeoning advertising business in the 1960's stays true to the times. We've come a long way, baby. thankfully, for women in the office place today.
B000002HPV|4.0|I think Bjork is great.  Her singing is from another planet.  I liked her first two albums more than this one, but it is still a good album.  Standout tracks are Bachelorette and Hunter.  I wished she closed the album out with the greatest hits version of All Is Full of Love.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Love this book! I was just looking for a book to fill the gap between series... this became a new favourite! Absolutely love it. Fictional, yes, but very good indeed. The writing style is good, but the story line is amazing!
B008LVCKH6|5.0|I loved this book, it was written with a clever and witty sense of humour.  I thoroughly enjoyed the fantastical journey through history evoking memories of times I either lived through or learned about in school.  A great surprising read for me.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|This is one of the best anniversary episodes of Dr. Who ever produced.  I love the recent series' and this is an excellent example of their commitment to producing quality entertainment.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Love the music and the DVD with videos is wonderful -- love the fireplace scene while the music from the CD plays!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Great app... only problem is that it occasionally glitches and stops, which becomes very frustrating. Other than that it is very easy to use and does everything it says it will.
B00CWVBV4E|5.0|my kids love to watch it. Now I have to figure out how to download on to their tablet thingy. You can tell I am so techy
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I'm an avid Quora user,<br />and I stumbled upon a blog post from James which detailed the book.<br /><br />I love this book , and I've gone through it at least 3 times so far.<br /><br />Godspeed James!
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Nice new dvd. Play's great. Good picture, good sound.  Nice packaging, Nice quality. Nice dvd for the money. Glad to get it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is an amazing game because I have the game on the xbox 360 and now I have it mobile so I can play it every where now, but it takes up a lot of my space.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Set-up was a bit troublesome, had to call Google for assistance.  Assistance was very good, with help I was &#34;casting&#34; easily. Works great with You Tube, Netflix and Hulu Plus, Google plans to have other streaming sources optimized in the future.  Other streaming sources can be &#34;cast&#34; but now with the quality of optimized sources.
1490313370|4.0|Very interesting book, I haven't finished it yet unfortunately. I like what it has to say, some really good knowledge up in this book
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion rush because it has so many challenges on my kindle fire HD and my brother plays it a lot so do I I don't get games that cost money but this game is FREE it's really fun and expiring and it has costumes like all sorts you really need to get this game it's fun for the HOLE family :-) I just love it I'm almost out of words but get this game!!!!!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love this game, very addicting!!! Very time consuming I don't get much done once I start playing. Love this game!!!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Like the graphics a lot. Kids like the music and scores. Not enough time for young ones to finish. Could use a setting to increase time.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|My most favorite Christmas album ever!  Absolutely love their musical style - upbeat and fun, as well as reverent and peaceful.  It is on repeat, and my whole family loves it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game it's so fun to play. You guys should totally get this game. Give me a reason you shouldn't get this game
B00FQ5F5MC|5.0|Even though I already own all of the other Bastille releases, I love this band so much and want to support them.  The new tracks &#34;Skulls&#34; and &#34;The Draw&#34; are excellent and well worth the purchase.  All of the other tracks have been released before in some version or another.  And the new single, &#34;Of the Night&#34; is a masterpiece and the way the songs should have been!
020530902X|3.0|Dry, boring writing.  There are plenty of other great writing books out there that are better than this, but it gives you the basic.
6305212112|5.0|What can I say, how can you not like the movie, and some how relate to some of the scenes.  I cant think of one part I liked more than another.  I did try to fry up some green tomatoes...... didn't think much it that.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Would not have paid money for it but it was a nice diversion.  Would play new games if and when they come out.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I really liked this book. It was interesting, intriguing and spoke about technology in a manner that was mostly realistic. And, living in the SF Bay Area, it is always fun to read a book based in your back yard!
B00008NEQM|4.0|The music is good. Which is why I bought it. I was disappointed though because when the cd came, the jewel case was all busted up and the digital names of the songs didn't match the names of the songs printed on the case or what they're called anywhere else.<br /><br />However, I was able to talk with Amazon customer service and they worked with me so while I can't give it a 5 star rating, I'm no longer giving it a 3 or worse rating.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Hilarious, laughed and laughed.  Sure it was somewhat predictable, but soooo funny.  A great movie to watch if you need to have a good laugh!
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|Wonderful series that keeps the viewer enslaved (or should I say &#34;enthralled&#34;, chuckle, chuckle). Not an American made show, so you will not see the clean and beautifully made up people, flashiness and transparent glitter. Down-to-earth acting, story line and costuming evident here. As a History buff I enjoyed it. Yeah, a couple superficial/erroneous &#34;things&#34; (another Viking word!) were thrown in, but that's to be expected for plot flow. Overall a very enjoyable series that will be liked even by folks not so keen on History. A good story is always in fashion no matter what era you live in.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Nice graphics, great story line. This game is not hardest that I've played but is challenging enough to be interesting. Another great game from G5!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Amazing,as always<br />So in love with these books. Totally am transported into the lives of all the characters. Just wast a great book is supposed to do.
B008Y5T5ZE|5.0|This is an amazing movie!  You'll get stuck until the end trying to find out the real mystery!  You'll love it!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I love this.  Now when my husband and I take a trip both of us can keep our phones charged.  Wish i would have thought to invent something so simple yet so necessary when traveling.  Great piece.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read this book numerous times and its always better than the last. Hopefully you enjoy it as much as I do.
B000FC1JAI|4.0|I feel that this is the type of book that should be read by most people. A great guide to moderation and introspection very needed in this world.<br /><br />It is a book worth reading more than twice.
0684857219|5.0|This book is awesome! I have been wanting to start bodybuilding since I was young but did not know where to start. Very good information on how to train and develop muscle definition.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wish I could rate this as 10 stars.  Stupid Fox executives.  I *still* hate you for cancelling this show.
1451666179|5.0|I am a long time fan of Allie Brosh and I bought this book happy in the knowledge that it would put my favorite blog posts out on my coffee table. I was happy to find some new entries as well! Great gift for anyone who enjoys life at all. BUY THIS BOOK!
B00BJS7104|3.0|It was okay. Had some cool action sequences as well as some funny parts (bag heads lmao). Exaggerated as hell but that's Quentin. Some parts drag on.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Best Daniel Craig Bond movie.  Had a plot that could actually be followed.  Would have been 5 stars but it was a little too raw for the kids.
B00GLX0Z8C|2.0|Too much promoting isn't always a good thing as is the case here. Between the trailers and clips shown on talk shows and in theaters prior to the release of the movie, there was nothing left to laugh at.  You can fill in the blanks between these clips and be left feeling like you've seen the movie already by the time you watch it, or find it bland because it's pretty predictable.  I think I would have enjoyed it had I not seen so many promotional clips of the movie.  Those who didn't see the numerous trailers prior to the release of the movie will enjoy it most, and probably rate it much higher.
0739366408|5.0|I was on the fence about World War Z. I had people telling me it was great and others telling me it was boring. I'm really glad I ended up with the audio book. Since it is written in the style of a non-fiction I could see the written book being a little harder to get through. The audio book is wonderful. Engaging, interesting and with some great actors. Other than the very first storyteller's horrible Chinese Accent.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Great game, but annoying wait time if you fail a level. Unless you want to pay real money. No thanks.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|It was a very good remake of the first Superman.  I can't wait until the sequel comes out for it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app. I love puzzles and don't have room for them at my place. I'm never going to loose another puzzle piece again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love how hey aloe you to play on and off online and how they give yo and options on how you play
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This a good app for keeping track of your local weather and for friends, family and travelling.  It's as accurate as it can be considering the vagaries of weather.  The map in motion leaves something to be desired...sometimes it will show rain or snow and then it disappears.  That can be a little dicey if you're tracking bad weather.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend it.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This was more awesome than expected! Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul hand delivered to this to me! Well, actually, that was a dream but the magnets and science behind the construction of this epic bundle is just as good, bitch!
B0051XQI84|5.0|Love this movie! One of our family favorites! The humor is clean and entertaining for both kids and adults. :)
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I just got the game and I love it  sometimes it takes  a bit to catch a animal or dinosaur depending what it is it takes some coins to get the animals trust you can earn coins by tapping on the habitat and feed it for free you don't have to buy food  the only time you buy food is to catch a animal I got my favorite dinosaur  and.if you the right animals you breed a dragon Bigfoot griffans werewolves Pegasus and other creatures! You should get it you will love it
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I have most of these dvds and as u can c i gave them 5 stars cuz they deserve them.  the power cord i know nothing about it and the mantis i don't care for.  Now waiting for the 2 more dvds i oedered. due tomorrow 12/4/13.  but, have some other dvds to get still.  Kip Harless
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fantastic shows, incredible series, wonderful characters come to life and become part of the family.  I love Professor McGonagal in her role as the matriarch.  I love England, lived there for 6 years working for a US company.  There's just everything right about the series and nothing to complain about.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This is my favorite Wimpy Kid book so far.  I just couldn't put it down.  I can use Greg for my character traits assignment in school.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|What can I say but that these books were a constant challenge.  Not only was it challenging to follow the geography of this novel, trying to keep track of the various ruling families, kings, knights and warriors, plus all the other main and incidental characters was also mind bending.  I actually kept notes so I could follow the plot line and dramatic events which were a constant occurrence in this novel.  I don’t know how the author kept track but can fully understand why it took so long to publish these books.<br />The author seemed to draw heavily on Medieval Europe and transcended that period of time and the many slaughters, intrigues and barbaric occurrences into a land of fantasy.  I must admit, it was hard to put the books aside once I started on the first book.  I hope it doesn’t take the author another five years to continue with the next two renditions of his Game of Thrones.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love being able to connect to facebook on my kindle anywhere I go!  Great way to keep in touch!
B008602KQI|5.0|Hunger games do I really need to say anymore.  Ok well amazon is making me, but you know you will love this movie.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Love love love this album! But yet again...piano guys never disappoint! I love playing it in my 2nd grade classroom! My students love piano guys!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|A very compelling and exciting march through places of unbelievable realms.  There have been so many renditions of the attempted creation of a master race, stemming from the archives of World War II, that this is quite a traumatic presentation of that theme.  At times I found the setting and characters completely unbelievable and realized that this is a blend of fantasy, fiction and non-fiction, however, I was riveted to the plot and had to finish the book to the end.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is a nice way to play spider solitaire without the cards and it also is nice that I can play it on the go!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I Totally Love TPG. They Are SO Awesome!!!!<br /><br />The Piano Guys Christmas Album Is Awesome. I Love the whole Album. But My 2 Favorite Songs Songs Off The Album are Angels we Have Heard on High and Winter Wind.<br /><br />TPG Is Excellent.
B00GGEV828|5.0|First, I’ll give my rating. I give The Hobbit 5 stars! It was excellent. The pace of the movie was good, the most pertinent information was covered and it ended at an excellent place leaving us wanting more and anticipating the next movie.<br /><br />Don’t get me wrong… This isn’t your kids’ Hobbit. This movie shows violent fight scenes and makes adult jokes. But the movie is fantastic and even if you haven’t read the book, you’ll enjoy the movie and the storyline. Just don’t be surprised by the shallow plot line.
B008FYZIVY|3.0|Video quality wasn't very good, but was better than nothing since we had not seen the series on HD, We will be watching this year on PBS in HD.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Kate Mulgrew is AMAZING as the first featured female starship Captain!  About time they got around to that.  Add in the Dr. and the rest of the ensemble cast and it's an incredibly entertaining show.  You can't help but root for them each episode!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is fabulous!!!  Love every piece on this CD!  Wish I had known about the special addition that she just released to Target in October (2013) so that I had even more of her music!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good solitare game. You can set different parameters for the game if you would like. Very relaxing, and very easy.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was an excellent story involving the sensative subject of racial tension in the south. &#34;Sycamore Row&#34; is my first John Grisham book since I became a fan of legal suspense thrillers. It did not disappoint. Grisham's writing style showed indepth knowledge of his subjects and kept me engaged from beginning to end. I couldn't stop reading trying to anticipate the next move of these lawyers who were fighting the validity of a handwritten will expressing the true wishes of an old man dying who commits suicide. It was such a page-turner that I had to breakdown and &#34;Whispersync&#34;. Plus, with the tie to &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; movie, I could visualize many of the characters, even though the writer did a good job with descriptions.  I'm now on the hunt for my next John Grisham.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This has been a great gAme for the kids. The only complaint I have is that when we upgrade we always have to delete to reload. This is very irritating. My nd
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Amazing Book! Always love John Grisham - he never lets a reader down.  Can't wait for his next book! :)
B00881VLCE|1.0|Art first, this app was great. Loved it so much, I bought the ad free 4.99 puzzle pack. The puzzles<br /> didn't show up and the whole store is gone. I just get an error message. What a rip-off!
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|Wow!  Everyone has a right to their opinions on this one.  But we didn't make it through 10 minutes of this sad, sad production.  Sorry, but I've seen this show 4 times on stage and it is one of my absolute favorites of all time.  BUT this movie is definitely for the miserable.  There were a few characters with good voices.  Eponine, the actress came from the London production, thank God!  And Marius was good as well.  I love Hugh Jackman's stage and film work.  This one, not so much.  His neck looked like it was going to explode when he sang.  Don't know why, it couldn't be all character, could it?  This had the potential to be a fantastic film.  But Hollywood wanted Hollywood actors in it. People who don't have the chops to perform the difficult vocals.  If they would JUST take a chance on stage performers who DO have the chops and who DO have the skills to make it magic, they might just discover someone REALLY  GREAT!  What a concept!  Instead we did get everything that is miserable in Victor Hugo's epic story.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It is really fun and should download it. Their are only two flaws.  1 it is really hard to get money. 2 you have to recharge your team but if you ran our you have to wait for 10 min or buy some.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|My husband and I watched all seasons of Desperate Housewives together.  That show was extremely entertaining since there were a lot of things happening on Each show. It was really nice to be able to turn on the show whenever we chose.  It's difficult for us to be in front of the TV at a specified time, we're always so busy.  Purchase and enjoy!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Very informative! It answered my questions!! I am among many who are confused by all of the diets and instructions flying around about how to lose weight. This book cleared up much of the false information.
B00B04KVMC|5.0|Worth every penny.  I have the CD, but the vinyl is so perfect.  This was definitely how  the soundtrack is supposed to be played and enjoyed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game!!! It is super fun and has many places for you to run. Also many different costumes! I love this game and think that everyone will enjoy it!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|The mobile game works out great and I love the fact they made it for the kindle, working on the achievements for console version.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I thought that Dr. Who was cheesy when I first began watching it (first season (modern) w/ Chris Eccelston).<br />After about 5 episodes, I was hooked, and I've only been watching since the spring.<br />Something I've noticed about Season 5 w/Matt Smith, is that the production quality has gotten even better. I can tell it's filmed natively in HD, the special effects are of a higher quality, and the set designs are more elaborate as well.<br /><br />I think that Matt Smith might be my favorite Doctor, but who knows!?!<br />I like Amy Pond, but I must say, I miss Rose Tyler.<br /><br />All around, if you give this series a chance, I believe you won't want to stop watching.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is full of fun, humor and action. It gives lots of information on Greek Mythology. It's a great read for someome of any age. A truly amazing book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super fun! I love this game so much and I am so glad that I downloaded it!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|This book was fantastic, could not put it down can't wait to read the next one book and very excited for the next tv season!
0689505698|5.0|A fun little twist on a classic children's story. The Big Bad Pig is the villain and the three little wolves are the peaceful animals trying to build a home.
B00FANXZL8|5.0|Absolutely loved the bonus disc--&#34;Atomica&#34; and &#34;Like a Rocket Man&#34; should have made this initial disc. They were far better than a couple of the other cuts on the original NEXT DAY! What's NEXT?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Very frustating when  you have amassed 30 lives and you come back after a brief break and all of your lives are<br />gone#!! Why does this happen?  /)Very annoying !#!##  Fix it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Several main characters that you wonder how they are going to mesh up, but finally do.  Story a little different than usual womens books. Enjoyed it & would recommend to my friends.
B003V1WXKU|3.0|Good book a little self serving, but honest. A brilliant mind always searching. I could have done without the nude models story.
0763668966|5.0|\\"Maps\\" by Alexsandra and Daniel Mizielinska is not a comprehensive world atlas.  It does not provide detailed topography; elevations; population of cities indicated by font size; or other conventional and expected information.  However, what \\"Maps\\" does provide is a wealth of trivia and enough information to pique the reader's interest in learning more about each of the selected 42 countries, the Arctic and the Antarctic.<br /><br />Printed on heavy paper stock that is parchment-like in appearance, the illustrations and style of \\"Maps\\" are reminiscent of vintage maps.  Illustrations are cartoon-like and plentiful.  Some may find the maps \\"busy\\".<br /><br />Information for each entry includes a picture of the country's flag; the name of the capital city; the official language; the population; and the land mass' area.  Cities are shown in red.  Other information included about each country includes animal species found in the specific country; points of interest; foods; cultural information; some geographic features.  All information is brief and serves only as a \\"teaser\\" inviting the reader to explore the country further.<br /><br />Readers seeking a comprehensive atlas that includes information about every country in the world may be disappointed in \\"Maps\\".  It is not a geography book seeking to be all things to all readers.  Individuals seeking an unusual, quality book that may encourage children and adults alike to research the included countries further will find \\"Maps\\" a delightful book and one that is well worth purchasing.
0812550706|5.0|In the aftermath of a devastating attack from an alien species called the Buggers, earth has been forced to change. Gone are the days where humans rule the skies. Gone is the relative safety we came to expect from life on earth. Gone are the days where children lead peaceful, fun lives. And unfortunately, Ender’s life is less peaceful than most. Born the third child in a world where only two children are permitted per family, Ender is already a man (or boy) apart. And as the child exceptional child, the one expected to succeed where the first two failed, his brother Peter is none-too-happy about his existence. Tormented at home by his brother, tormented at school by his peers, Ender’s exceptional intelligence doesn’t seem to help him at all. Until one day, he is attacked at school. And even though he doesn’t want to, even though he does everything he can to avoid the conflict, Ender puts an end to the bullying. Shortly thereafter, a man arrives at his door and asks Ender to join the school that prepares children to fight the Buggers. Well, maybe “ask” is the wrong word. Colonel Graff explains that Ender’s exceptional abilities may be earth’s last hope.<br /> As Ender endures the rigorous and challenging life of battle school, he seems to be a man apart once more. Will he be able to fit in? Will he be able to save to world from the Buggers? Will he ever understand his role in the world he’s need forced to be a part of?<br /><br />In this fast-paced and gripping coming-of-age, science fiction novel, Orson Scott Card chronicles a young boys journey from adolescence to adulthood, as he struggles to learn the difference between man and child, loner and friend, friend and leader, warrior and individual. Will he find his way? Will he be able to withstand the pressure? Can he be the savior the world needs him to be? And even if he does, can he be all those things and still be the kind of man he desperately wants to be?
B009AZZEU2|1.0|The sc I got was not king animal. It was another cd in the king animal packaging. This was quite a shock.
B0032KNA4I|3.0|Imagine if, in the 1930s, Frank Capra had made a movie in which the Nazis saved the last remnants of the world from doomsday.<br />So it is with this movie and its ridiculous storyline of Communist Fascist China and their efficient (slave) workforce building a fleet of Arks to save humanity.<br />Naturally, being European, Roland Emmerlich can't help but sling mud at America's &#34;evil&#34; white male leaders.<br />Outstanding special effects help save this movie from the ash heap of history (barely).
B00FLDG5BE|3.0|Anyone heard if there is going to be a product recall on this item?The visual noise is definitely not related to low lighting in the venue as even the backstage footage has the same problem.I'd probably give it 5 stars if not for the picture quality.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I think that this was a great way to do all of the English dictionary word of the world to have a great deal.
B00G2KV92U|1.0|If it wasn't for all of the previous good music from Boston, this release would have been 0 stars.<br />None of the tracks pop.  None of them make you say \\"this is a good tune\\".  As a long time Boston fan, it's tough for me to say this but this album/cd is a disappointment<br /><br />UPDATE - Tom, you need to sit down with some other professionals and write ONE GOOD SONG that we can rally around!  OK...agreed...this album was a mistake, but it's not over if you can just put out one more good tune.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Excellent movie!  I'd heard how good it was and never had the chance to see it in the theater.  When it popped up as a choice the other day we decided to watch it.  Denzel Washington absolutely rocks his character in this movie.  It's a must see!
B00BGI08GG|4.0|I loved the Action, and the story line.  Although dry at times and somewhat predictable, I found myself getting drawn back in.
B00170GXQ2|1.0|disappointed by the picture quality of the blu ray.<br />Bad transfer not any better then a dvd.<br />Still a great film.
