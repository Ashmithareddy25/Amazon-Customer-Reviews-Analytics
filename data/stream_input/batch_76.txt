B0042ZPA9U|4|Can't beat it for the price.
B005BNYY26|4|Used to replace original Ventlines (10 years).  Appear to be just as good.  We'll have to see how long they last.
B00FOOW01O|5|I was glad to find this item as I was selling my car and needed a replacement came quickly as I asked and paid priority it came and I fitted sale of car went ahead success all round
B00DJ4FGMQ|4|My little honda rebel really likes this stuff... ive tried castrol (motorcycle) and rebel hated it. The stuff burnt an  left crust on my clutch case... anyways i change every 1,000mi and i could use reg car oil in the rebel.. but he seems to really like this valvoline... so he will keep gettin it. I drive in city traffic mostly and it hold  up great. 4star is for the price... you can get this stuff for under 4 bucks a quart at that big smiley face corporate monster.. tax included..
B008Y80RMG|5|fir perfectly
B00IO3KQPO|1|The product was very thick resulting in my body position being extremely high up and very close to my cars ceiling. I had to move my seat closer to my steering wheel as the bottom cushion raised my legs up so I was not able to reach the pedal and I found that position uncomfortable being so close.  The cushion became very hot after a few minutes. After a full day running errands in and out of my vehicle hoping that the cushions would feel comfortable I found that to not be the case. I am disappointed that I did not read the return policy before I placed the order. As this cushion set weighed 30 lbs and I had to pay return shipping and was charged a 20% restocking fee. So I paid $115 but only received back $50 after paying shipping and the restock fee. So I guess you could say I rented this cushion for a day at a very expensive cost. I would not recommend it.
B000IZ2E1K|5|EXCELLENT!  So far, no problems. My car runs like a sewing machine. Part was packaged box within a box and very secure. definitely will purchase other parts and highly recommend!!'nn
B005FK48IU|5|works good
B00HFL3JLO|5|Fitment was perfect, shipping quick.
B00PSRORH2|4|Saw baby looking at the shade a couple of times, but I think he is over it... it's better than staring at a black shade though... it stays on well. I think it's cute... maybe that's all that matters. LOL
B008B67OCM|5|Received A/C high/ low hose Assembly on scheduled time. Great quality only difference is that it's made of Steel not Aluminum. Not a big deal as it kept the cost down while still working the same. I will use Global Parts again in the future.
B004A6JA2O|5|CLEAN AIR IN THE CAB.
B0009IQXAE|5|Only cleaning product for you car that you will need to purchase! Love this stuff!
B00E1SOZMQ|5|I have not had any problems so far.  They fit great and they also saved me from rear ending someone in the freeway.  I would definitely recommend these.
B000I45Y8Q|5|Seem great, good finish. Didn't break when they torqued my upper intake studs.
B003A19ZQG|5|perfect
B0006309VG|5|Awesome filter. Top quality
B00252BBA4|5|Great Product
B000WEMH4G|5|Great product
B00J3DA36Q|5|fits well, thanks.
B000C0WOY8|5|Delivered to Jersey, Channel Islands in very short time. Fits as a direct replacement for both the serpentine idler and tensioner pulleys on 1998 Jaguar XK8/R range (although the Amazon parts selector will tell you otherwise). MUCH cheaper than the OEM Jaguar  parts :)
B00KJ8JBO4|2|The kit is decent. Everything does work, but the lamps are different colors. One of my lights has become noticeably greener than the other. Installation was pretty straightforward, and although there was a bit of a warmup time for the lamps, they would be full brightness by the time I got out of the driveway. If only the lamps could be the right color, I would give 5 stars. YMMV
B0092UX9DY|3|I put the front ones on first and they fit perfectly and the rear ones are cut wrong for my year deville.
B003YMRNV0|5|Good quality rotors at a good price.  Fit my 06 Tundra perfectly.
B003Z9T33I|1|Cover does not lay flat along the bed rails where the folding hinges are. Returned.
B00BNIOH84|5|As expected
B000V5SX6M|5|I spent a lot of time looking for a roof rack for my 2007 Accord before finally purchasing this one. This roof rack is exactly what I needed. It looks great, wasn't too much of a pain to put together and the cross bars are awesome to have, too.
B00M4IWB58|2|Bought these for my husband who has very large hands to wear while out on our motorcycle. Most 2x's are too snug. Thought these would work, as they were listed as 3x, but they were smaller than most 2x's he has tried in the stores. I would say they are more sizes as a woman's 3x than a man's 3x. I wear a L-XL in women's and these fit me with a little bit of room. I wouldn't wear them driving as they would be too loose but I will be keeping them for myself when I'm riding while my husband is driving.
B00TOUP7OQ|5|Tie downs work great and are easy to install.  Just pop out the plastic OEM cover, loosen the screw on the Bull Ring tiedown, insert into the hole in the bed, and tighten.  I had all 9 installed in 15 minutes.  They seem very strong and will easily hold down anything I could haul in my truck.  I do have the factory spray in bed liner and it did not affect the mounting at all.
B000FRLO9Y|5|The 7002 is a great charger for batteries that sit long periods or for weekend maintenance of modern vehicles with a billion electrical components (BMW & Porsche I'm looking at you!). The battery rehabilitation process this charger has saved at least one battery that no longer wanted to hold a charge due to prolonged periods of slowly draining.
B005WLC334|5|Great product, fast shipping and easy to install.
B00AQI8SH8|5|Fit my 2011 Camry perfectly. Super easy to install. Did not come with instructions. You may need a couple taps with a rubber mallet (or regular hammer covered with a cloth) for final placement. The vanity light worked perfectly after installation.<br /><br />A couple notes:<br />1) Amazon's prices for this visor fluctuate frequently. Expect to pay around $55. If the price goes up, wait a week.<br /><br />2) Some 2007-2011 are eligible for a 'Customer Support Program' free replacement. You need to check the Toyota website to see if your car qualifies.
B00K7W5ABA|2|Really weak magnets, not very water resistant.  Over all this bag just is a pain to use.  I am just constantly fighting it and it's more hastle than it's worth.
B00U0V0JZU|5|Item was as described and easy to put on except that one of the screws was stripped, so my husband had to rig it up with some washers.  They did work fine for a trip with a carrier on top.
B004SF3CK8|5|Fits and works perfectly.  .My old unit looked fine but wasn't working anymore, this fixed the problem
B000L9AD2U|5|Best 12V pump I ever owned
B000F0Z7NA|1|Wasn't Satisfied. Got a different brand than advertised
B00G1YCMFK|2|Good quality product. Just never fit my application. Hit the engine mount on the drivers side and hit the starter on the passenger side.
B008GYOC1K|2|Product didn't last a year, before ripping apart
B005IGRX24|5|Received the filters. All good.
B008FCE8IA|5|Arrived in timely manner...was easy to install.
B00YG1GN1Y|5|Thea's seats are awesome, at first when you see them in the photos you think that they are cheap but when you open your package its 10x better then you think
B005NY0T4A|5|Very cute keychain. A little on the big size for a keychain but still a delight.
B00SAHO9GG|5|Imprved throttle response and a slightly raised rev limit.
B001UCCGJA|5|Fixed my blower chirping in my Toyota Tacoma, great!!
B000EDQR4Q|5|We have a skylight in our master bedroom. Too much of a good thing in summer. We used these as &#34;curtain rods&#34; to stretch fabric over the skylight and reduce the light.
B004TRKBOK|5|great product
B00XZ9MWWC|5|Great protective cover for my car key.  Fits perfectly.  Well worth the small cost to protect the key when accidentally dropped.
B008I7PAUC|5|Came quickly, fit great, thank you
B006TMME6G|5|YEAH I have eyes again
B00282YGA8|5|Fit a ford focus
B00QUOQT4Q|5|I love that it comes from a small owner who hand writes your address and name. Also gets lots of attention
B002YKG28S|5|very good for removing tile
B007P748H2|5|Very fast shipping and parts were as described in listing
B00J8V1XW6|4|Very sturdy and looks great on Raptor.  Also, does almost as well as original antenna for range.  Am very pleased.
B00MHUIL0W|5|Excellent quality, much thicker than expected, which is great!  Very happy with this purchase!
B008X02JLC|5|Perfect fit and easy to install.  This assembly saved me a lot of time and head ache.  I do wished that there had been some instructions in the box, but that is what YouTube is for.  Only four nuts/bolts on and off and it was over.
B0037BYN3O|5|Fits my 1989 and 1991 Volvo 240's windshields perfectly. I bought another of HeatShield's sunshades for a 2009 Toyota Yaris which is also a perfect fit. It rolls up nicely and still holds it shape after months. The current summer weather in Houston, TX is 100 F+, and I have no covered parking at my new work location. I suffered for the first week, and it would take the entire duration of my 25 minute commute home to get the car's interior temperature to a reasonable level. Now it takes 5 minutes. Really impressed with HeatShield - highly recommended.
B0043BMOMY|4|The look great on my explorer..
B004AIDARS|1|SUCKS
B00JREPRJE|5|Ordered for a 2012 Prius. Arrived from China in 9 days (less if you don't count weekends). They nicely finish off the stylish black OEM wheels that hide behind the boring hubcaps. The quality is fine and they look and feel good. They pop right in and feel very secure. At less than five smackaroos per, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />If you're apprehensive about ordering a non-OEM apart from China like I was, don't be. These are just fine. Go for it. Now, as for that bright red &#34;cold&#34; air intake for your '94 Civic, well...
B001551DQY|2|Started out great but after one year, the painted chrome finish has bubbled up and turned white.  Needs to be longer lasting.
B008NO5QDQ|5|Works good so far
B00JGQLQ5M|3|Not a comfy by Amy stretch, more accurately, a&#34;Saturday afternoon at the movies&#34;,kinda drama
B000BLJHHU|5|Bought this top for my fiancée's '05 Jeep Wrangler and it fits perfectly. Excellent quality. Exceeded my expectations. The company is great to work with as well. Fantastic experience all around.
B00480BVXS|5|The Insect Screen fit grate, look good.
B0009IBJAS|5|Easy to charge batteries and no need to worry about it overcharging
B00829RHE8|4|Will not work on all wheels or caliper set ups but when it works it saves time. Also be careful with it it is not very solid so no throwing it or letting the heavy tools land on it.
B00065L2D8|5|Easy to use I can use it with the air compresser in a cigirette lighter.
B0002STTPM|5|Works perfectly. Grips wheel weights better than any other tool I have used
B00F7NEREU|4|so far working good...might have to look as i use further...
B00KGNLLZ4|5|Exact factory replacement and 1/4 the cost of the local dealer.
B00KULF2XY|4|ACDelco 14D741CH Advantage Ceramic Front Disc Brake Pad Set<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very linear/progressive braking<br />Good stopping power<br />Not too grabby<br />No noise<br />Comes with new sims (back of brake pads and mounting shims)<br /><br />Cons: None as of yet<br /><br />Just recently got these brake pads and so far I am very satisfy with them. This was for and install on a 1998-2002 generation Toyota Corolla.<br />I will update this review down the road to see how long these brake pads last.
B005JU5X6M|5|My best purchase i loved the feel of a genuine product on my windshield.
B000JFHMZW|5|AWESOME ---- It looks cool JUST sitting here, and I have not even used it once!!!
B005GL8OPG|1|soaked up water like a sponge and disappeared during the first storm we had.......NEVER AGAIN
B002TTOI08|5|If you review and item, then go back a 2nd time to change your review. It seems amazon will not update your review.
B00HMZFHI6|4|Great product!
B001RB61LS|5|For the Horde!! This looks badass on my car ;)
B000NTE7BQ|5|Fast service, inexpensive, and high quality parts.
B006QGD996|5|Worked great at keeping my load secure on a 2500 mile trip, every time I stopped and checked them they were doing just fine, never had to readjust or tighten any of them.
B00PB7VD62|5|worked great!
B005NLQAHS|4|I would have given this 5 stars if it worked with my car.  I own a 1997 Nissan Altima that will not start, but while it was running it had a check engine light.  I almost sent it back but confirmed that it did work when I had to rent a car and tired the reader on a 2015 Ford Focus.  Using an Android phone with a free app I could see all the details the BAFX reader provides.
B00G0OM2BK|5|Looks and performs exactly like OEM. Install is pretty straightforward.
B00GJMQSC2|2|Sent them back because they were more like wearing snow pants.
B00MOR4CFG|2|I BOUGHT THESE LIGHTS BACK IN APRIL AND ITS ONLY AUGUST AND ONE OF MY LIGHTS IS ALREADY FLICKERING PRETTY BAD.. I TOOK IT OFF AND ADJUSTED THE WIRES THINKING THAT WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM... IT DIDNT WORK..<br />THE LIGHTS WERE PRETTY BRIGHT AND I LOVED THE COLOR.. BUT THEY DID NOT LAST VERY LONG...
B00GUF74HQ|5|Bought this for the mother in law, yep dearest mother drives a truck, a big truck, actually scares me.<br />This product eases the tailgate down at a nice pace. Hopefully this will keep her triceps smaller than mine. This product does not assist in lifting the tailgate up, only down which means her biceps will probably be bigger than mine but over time I will learn to live with this.<br />Customer service has been great, I did need a new post since hers broke and they sent me a replacement quickly at no charge. Not sure if it was the snapchat photo I sent of my mother in law or they do this for everyone. Great product, great price!
B00R5R8CNS|5|Delivery it was fast,fit perfect and no problem to install and very good price
B00TM015XA|5|great deal
B000AMXT0G|5|PERFECT!
B00HD9TCFU|5|PERFECT FOR MY HONDA. AND THE PAGE HELP ME TO WRITE SPECIFIC INFO OF MY CAR TO SEE IF ITS FITS. AND WHEN I GOT IT, IT WAS PERFECT FIT AND SIZE. AND GOT IT IN THE TIME THEY SAY. ON TIME
B002DZJQ0A|1|It's only 3M dual locking tape.  The ez-pass mounting strips are resistant to heat where the adhesive on the strips I got fell off within a few hours.
B000GU7JGW|5|Perfect for riders who have passengers that want that extra feeling of control. Sturdy, doesn't feel cheap and fits fairly big. I wear a size 42 waist but it can go bigger. My wife definitely enjoys riding my motorcycle with me a lot more now.
B000WJAZL8|5|Works great
B00VSQAQC2|5|[[VIDEOID:982c55cf9ed2920a96b27dc33d69122a]] The MAOAUA professional scan tool reads and erases engine fault codes on OBDII/EOBD compliant vehicles, including those equipped with the next generation Control Area Network (CAN).<br /><br />I have used many scan and code readers some costing thousands some not so much, what you are getting here is a really affordable scan tool with every thing you will need to diagnose and rectify 99% of the faults or pending fault on you're vehicle.<br /><br />Main Features for this impressive product are as follows:-<br /><br />-Read and erase engine fault codes.<br />-Switch off/ check engine light (MIL).<br />-On screen code definitions.<br />-View live engine sensor readings.<br />-Read freeze frame data.<br />-read on-board test results and status.<br />-Easy and quick to use.<br />-Large back-lit display.
B0002JMF9S|1|It Does fit and screw on...but when you try to connect the fitting from the AC pro charging kit ..it does NOT grab. It should just snap on as soon as you push it.it just keeps popping off. Removed it from the low line and just tried to connect it for fitment....no luck!
B000FW4MD4|5|Hubby uses it all the time. Unbelievable how well it works!
B004C6Q46M|5|Arrived in a timely manner and works great.
B0001EVXDI|5|Great love them work as they should
B00230HTKE|5|fit our Yamaha Waverunner as an OEM.
B0107WKYV0|5|Great!<br />At first I was a bit skeptical about whether these labels actually survive the washing.<br />Pleasantly surprised!<br />Delivery, quality and even more important the bonding of strips are of high quality.<br />Gladly again!
B00YQ8PQLK|5|Bright!  Clearly visible in direct sunlight.
B00THK5SVU|5|good
B00ZQ32VVC|4|Good fit & look. Only problem I have is ,the left lens stays fogged unless I let air in it.
B00NLMD6L4|5|Without this car cover, I would continually have tree spots all over my car. Easy and light-weight to put on the car myself. Recommend!
B00ARYPQ30|1|This was a big disappointment and a waste of time and money.  The simple fact is that only a few of the LED's on either of the strips actually lit up when connected to the power source.  Obviously, the company making / selling these does not engage in quality control or testing of the product before shipping them out.  See my photo for confirmation.
B00265FXTA|5|Easy to put in
B000BBUH7Y|1|This part appears to have been designed not as a license plate cover, but simply as a transparent version of the body-colored front bumper insert that is installed from the factory. Unfortunately, the factory insert depends on access to a second set of bottom mounting holes that are not accessible when a license plate is installed! Maybe the mounting hole situation is different for other model years, but on my '95 ZR-1, there doesn't appear to be any way to mount this cover without drilling a couple access holes through the license plate itself. I'm not doing that.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the construction, that's disappointing too. For a cost (including shipping) of almost $35, I suppose I was expecting an injection-moulded part with some rigidity to it. What I got appears to be cheaply blow-moulded, flimsy, and with rough and imprecise edges.
B00K1PGKSA|5|As advertised and, shipping was sooner than expected.
B00JM6NDEI|5|factory original type
B00DIEFT6U|5|Excellent parts works great...
B001B5KHL0|3|Clutch is too grabby. Clutch pedal is stiff!
B00AWY95NM|5|I haven't used it yet, but it will be perfect next time I stop at McDonalds.  I will know exactly where the fries are as I am driving.  I always eat the fries on the way home.
B001AVE79S|4|Not the best but better value than the 3M Red since it's $4 cheaper. I use both intermittently and they seem to last the same amount of time on the workpieces I'm sanding. Adhesive on the Dura Gold is stronger/stickier than the 3M but I've never had a 3M disc come loose.<br /><br />Both are equally susceptible to tears on the edges<br /><br />I will order again in the future.
B00KJO3TU0|5|Works great, don't have to worry about voltages.
B00TPUAWB8|5|super good great mileage more power in my opinion
B009D3JJGQ|4|Nice, heavy-duty and durable, but I wish they were a little wider because there's definitely going to be a dirt halo around them on the floor. I didn't want to get the third-party super-duty ones because they looked a little too heavy, but they do wrap way up past the common dirt area and, if I had to do it over again, would probably go with them.
B00P9AB4OC|5|This was a gift and they loved it
B00L84BXGC|4|What was expected.
B000CRB10E|1|Poor quality.  It broked the same day i installed. .very disappointed. Well what was i specting of a 20 dollars mount.
B008O9DV78|5|The black tank on our fifth wheel became plugged.  I ordered this flush valve and it worked perfectly.  I plugged it onto the trailer's drain line, closed the gate valve and turned the hose water on.  I waiting 'til the line was completely filled with water and the last of the bubbles had vanished, and then let it run for a minute or so to completely clear the blockage.  I turned off the hose valve and opened the gate valve, and presto!  Note that I didn't use my rig's drinking water hose, even if this unit has an anti-backflush valve.  I have a short hose which I use when I don't want to potentially contaminate my drinking water hose.
B00BDEP5ZM|5|Good price for my preferred tank treatment !!
B0002MABGE|3|GETS THE JOB DONE, BUT IS TOO TALL FOR MY CAR.  QASHQAI 2014.
B006FXI2ZQ|5|Installed on 2002 NISSAN SENTRA SER<br /><br />These are exactly what I needed, a nice thick protector to deflect dirt and rocks while giving the old foglights a new look. These have been on my car for approximately 7 or 8 months now and there have been no signs of craking, peeling or hazing.<br /><br />This is not exactly a CON but let me say these are not the easiest things to install, I removed both my foglights during the installation, I can only imagine how much more difficult it would have been had I not. Before installation you will have to sit down and determine where on your foglight these will fit best as they do not appear to be made for specific makes and models, rather models that utilize it's size or smaller. I can only speak for my car but the fitment was pretty close to  the actual size of my foglight, I had to trim and edge but nothing serious. You will need a old credit card or squeegee to help iron out the bubbles as you go as this is a pretty think piece of plastic with super sticky adhesive that does not like to form to curves unless you coax it. If you take your time they will go on clean and look professional when you are done.
B001O7I7H6|5|Used buffer and this product almost completely removed swirls on my black car. Next time I will use a more aggressive pad than the white.
B004OK86RG|5|A+
B00PT0K2BI|5|No problems  seems as good as OE
B00BD4SK0Y|5|They are great
B000KC1WEG|4|Good item for the money , release handle could be made a little better with markings for unlock and lock.
B002Y352EK|5|Easy to install. No modification needed. Sturdy construction and a great new look for my CJ5
B00LH05Q88|4|Fits 2013 Toyota Prius Four well enough to remove and tighten the oil filter cap without slipping.
B00NJAE2FC|5|fits very good
B000EALHHG|5|Works well. Have used this for years.
B008X5JI4I|5|Excellent
B00HW58R92|1|no quality is plastic. I USED ONE TIME AND TRASH IT...
B00G23UYAU|4|You get what you pay for.
B008RUINI6|3|good price, but didn't fix my problem.
B0013E0ZNE|5|GREAT FOR PERSONALIZED PLATE
B007IVSSQM|5|I installed these on my 1997 Ford E350 Econoline van. I knew the fit would not be OEM because the extendable towing mirrors were not available installed until the 2003 model year. It required drilling some new holes, elongating others and  enlarging others. I also had to purchase some new metric bolts and use some fender washers. It is not a job for someone not handy with tools and making templates. The portion of the mirror that attaches to the exterior of the door fits as the original did, after making the new holes, etc. It was a job I had contemplated for years. All that had been available otherwise were strap on mirrors which vibrated in the wind! Came out great!
B007BGGNX4|3|Yeah it's ok.  Dunno that I'll keep it.  It's not the full size it's not really a custom fit, although they tried it looks like, its just... weird.  it's about an inch and a half too short on the sides and the lip of the thing doesn't stand up straight, and it slides around over the carpet.
B00ELJLU96|5|LOVE IT
B000FCINUW|5|Works great. Very attractive design and well made.
B00KOQAU5U|5|Installed easy and fits great
B004AJ3M3E|3|pretty cheap to purchase, side windows fit well, rear window does not fit... needs to be folded.<br /><br />not the best storage bag.
B00GURR6NG|1|Didn't fit at all had to bend cut an took hours horrible buy
B000HBM6PE|3|Caulking gun is garbage, it broke instantly. The right stuff worked great, five stars for it but I had to rig a normal Caulking gun to work with the small tube.
B00ROSTUBG|5|Very impressed, 20 lugs and 4 spacers give my car a whole new look.
B00CNCBYQC|5|Good enough for the money
B00AQ2D4C8|5|So far so good
B005FNKFY8|5|Great quality/product.  Love that doesn't require a separate key and that I am able to use the key to the vehicle.
B004UQIUKW|5|allowed for very controlled polishing on my !969 chevrolet nova
B000NCS7GE|5|more than i expected of this product. well wort the money.
B00K56K1W6|5|Fast delivery.  Exactly as needed.
B005OCC25U|5|perfect
B000CERAW0|4|Works great
B00JGJGLWW|4|Good Quality. Exactly what I needed to convert my RV over to two 6 volt batteries.
B00XCNRGUO|1|This specifically says 2015 Cruze, which is why I bought them. They look great and I went to put them on my car today and they're WAY too big. :(
B00ANXSWQS|5|I love it , Thanks , Fast Shipping A+
B00DUGVHTE|3|Nice mirrors  but they could have done a better job with this  screw fasteners they're made of nylon and you want to be real careful not to strip them out my driver side screw threads were very tight that I would recommend a product
B00IO8IP3Y|4|This met my expectations and for the price vs the dealer price it is worth it.
B00PY4OJKY|3|Very bright, looks well made, a little too blue for my application.
B003P50WKK|5|Highly recommend!!!
B0040CTUAA|3|I really didn't like these because they were the wrong size for my Nissan Altima. They are good quality but the wrong size.
B0055DOCHO|5|I received CV boots clamps on time, great quality. I will definitely re order these clamps in the future when needed.
B00C8YXGB6|3|I like the concept and the patterns and it looks good. The promo says you can run over it with a 20 ton truck and shows a video to that effect. My first one was in a snow bank and run over by a 3/4 ton truck and now doesn't work. But for the price I've bought another to try.
B00DXP6LBQ|5|fixed the problem first time, unit working good.
B000LOI69C|5|Perfect for my safety chains.
B0081SQY1W|3|I thought these were the holder with a re-enforced hook but these are the same weak plastic hooks I already have. They are OK but tend to fall off from time to time.  I always pray they don't fall off when a cop comes by.
B000VNFUJ2|5|Good tool if you do synchronizers often (I hope you don't have to). Oil it up when using, helps with install and removal. otherwise it will bind up/stick(metal on metal). With old synchronizer still in engine, remove sensor, have someone slowly rotate crankshaft with wrench/breaker bar until tool drops into synchronizer. remember or mark direction the arrow on top of the tool is pointing. remove synchronizer. Install tool on new synchronizer and drop assembly into engine with arrow facing EXACT direction as old synchronizer. If synchronizer does not fall right into the engine, use a socket to rotate the oil pump drive shaft until it does fall right in.
B00U7FA35A|5|Very bright bulb....Works perfectly in the tail lights for my brake and turn signal light.
B006TMM9V6|5|Fit well easy to install
B009EVOVFQ|5|Looks and fits great. The material is slightly thinner than the Bestop branded version. If this were a soft top I would prefer the Bestop version but since It's basically to keep things out of site, it's just fine.
B00ULNXL5W|4|Good item. I'm satisfied
B0110CO95S|2|Not very good.  These aren't real skateboard stickers.  Bought these for my boys skateboard, got a weed sticker, and 2 girls licking a bananna, not happy about those.  I dont know how they stick but they arent real skateboard stickers.  Also, most have white edges around the stickers which was the reason i didnt buy a different set of stickers i was looking at.  I should have bought the other ones because they were close to actual skateboard stickers even if they had white border around it.
B00UNTU3VO|5|I was impressed with how this worked.  It out preformed the CA Car Duster.  I wished I had found this long before this.
B00IKPEL0W|2|I don't like these because they are to large for my Nissan Altima. (wrong size)
B00WKGPLEW|5|Great product and unbeatable customer service, recommend these guys all the way.
B00P3BL6EK|4|Fit is fine, but adjustment is maxed for alignment
B00D7ZAYI8|5|wow. Everything worked on first try.  Doors locked, remote start and doors locked. great product.
B006TMOW16|5|great fit
B004QHLG4W|2|Items looked to be good quality, but one of the two I installed hummed away shortly into my test drive. I could not detect any problem with the other one, but I elected not to chance it, and replaced both with OEM. Both fit perfectly with the exception of the anti lock cable which seemed to not quite fit into the mounting brackets.  I may have Got the only dud in the bunch, but it represents a lot of work replacing it and reinstalling a different one.  Two stars
B00BITKUUM|5|Works! Happy! Easy to replace. Took all of five minutes!
B003VAZ6OG|5|Fast and easy install, works great, I get more then 40 channels without a problem. Suggest using silicone or 5200 to make sure it is sealed good. I replaced my old one due to leaking at the base
B00HTWJBAW|5|Nice product,so i bought another for front..
B000JFL7ZS|5|Great Product
B00FS2TL8C|2|Bought a large based on reviews and it barely covers the fenders. I was hoping to cover at least a little bit of the tires.  Looks like a garbage bag with elastic on the bottom. That's probably why in the picture they have 1 wheel exposed - because they couldn't cover it. I have a Honda 450R so nothing huge.
B00FM7UFI8|5|Loved it, came fast and was a great value PLUS a quality product!!
B00J4TW6ZA|5|Great scooter, and a great price.Top speed on mine is about 32 MPH, so do not expect any faster. I am so happy with It, and its so fun to ride. there were some Issues with, it but were worked out. My suggestion is to go over it carefully after it is delivered,and take pictures of any problems right away. have fun and be careful, and were a helmet.
B00G620ZVU|3|Bright for size an money
B0085IEP9Q|3|Picture showed two prong adapter. 4 prong arrived. Returned for refund.
B00S8NJCPU|5|Looks great, love it
B0000AYZ7L|5|Works great,
B009CCM6CC|2|light color doesnt match original manufacture
B008N206SS|5|Awesome
B000CQHUYQ|2|They look like great clamps,  they just aren't 2 inch like it says,  on  a two inch od pipe tightened all  the way there was a gap of any 1/4 inch... Maybe these should be marked 2 and a half inch.
B00T9C0D4I|4|Fits right up have about 800 miles on it so far and like it
B000WMCJPK|4|It works. Welded on fine.
B000QUZ572|1|cheap plastic - not worth installing
B00MVH9DLW|5|Wow! Very bright! I can't remember if this was described as a spot light or a flood light but it kind of does both, but lends itself more to spot light applications. Great product. I bought two sets. The first set is used as fog lamps for my truck. Looks great! I was impressed.
B003U91X18|5|Amazing service! Would recommend to anyone!
B00KJ8IW8A|5|I bought these headlights about a year ago and am absolutely satisfied with them.  They are very bright and have not changed color one bit.  I got the 6000k, which are white with a light blue tint, and they still work perfect.  Very easy plug and play installation.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good quality replacement for their headlights.
B00FALVXEQ|5|This heavy polish really helped me cut the aluminum wheels and leaves a brilliant shine!
B0002JN56A|5|Finally after trying both Permatex products, this one worked. See my video at https://youtu.be/eVG2iOD-ceY where I use it.
B00657D83I|2|Subtle but cool... however after less than 2 yrs the red is completely faded. Had to re-glue after one year.
B000H8U1RC|5|Exact fit, fast delivery ande product
B00K53DLGM|5|Great replacement battery for my Honda generator.  Fast delivery.
B00LG07MZE|5|Nice shade. Big enough to fit my expedition window with no problem. Kept the car cool
B0009V1WS4|5|Works well.
B000C5C4QG|5|Very good quality,at a cheap price and shipping was delivered before date promised.over all very happy with product .
B008ZTX05K|5|Great helmet, love it also got the tinted shades helmet fits great and they come in three colors, black,blue,green , got the black , love it,  Thank you
B00757E7LE|5|It fits my 2014 FJ just fine. Looks MUCH better than the stock antenna and I don't have to remove it before going into aa automated car wash. Seems to work just fine as I am pulling in just as many stations as before.
B000G7AJUS|5|It's big on one end and small on the other. Not sure what else you want from a funnel.
B00WCJNUEK|4|Look like fenders.  Perform like fenders.
B004A4ICPM|1|Didn't have enough fuel pressure to keep the vehicle running. Complete crap and its not a simple part to replace. So I bought a new one. The old saying you get what you pay for comes to mind. I blame myself but warn others.
B00BFDJ9EE|1|The sway bar link came in a sealed plastic bag. The description states two 10mm nuts come with the link, but there are no nuts in the package.
B004ZF43Y0|4|fast shiping  ...so far so good
B00BFU3BJQ|5|works fine
B00CSX42WY|2|The front emblem has yellowed in just a few months. Pass on these if you are looking for a quality product.
B00CUJF32E|2|They don't hold keys  very well unless the key is very large.
B0007Y4P8W|5|Exact match for the original covers on my 1996 Jayco popup camper, and very easy to install.  Not much else to say...they were genuine parts that fit as designed.
B00TZ9SR52|5|Fits as expected. Had to squish the cable keeper a bit with some plyers to fit it in its slot on the clutch side, still fits and functions properly. The cable adjustment on the clutch side is different than the one cable as well, I assume b/c it has been modernized.
B00N3VYMJ8|5|Awesome
B0009JKGEM|5|For the low price, the product does it's job.
B0002NIIMW|5|Very nice
B00QQXCCGA|5|perfect
B0058D7ZS4|5|Love it.
B00MLO3S52|4|I got this face mask at a discount in exchange for a review. The mask fits well and snuggly, as it's going to get cold with cycling in the winter. Otherwise it is too warm to use it during the summer. The mask otherwise is easy to breathe thru it as there are vents in front. I did use the facemask during a paintball game and it helped reduce the pain, bruising and cuts from paintball shots. It also makes look cool when u take off your mask and other players see u with the neoprene neck face mask. I wish there was an option to add a hood to this, but i guess that can be easily done with a diy. The mask is cheap even at its full retail price. Would recommend it.
B004P23VQO|2|It took my husband ALL DAY putting this on my jeep! The instructions clearly say only takes 2 hours. It does not stay zipped all the way either
B00NOG0PNO|5|This is very much a spot beam, they all seem to be focused into a fairly tight circle instead of just having all LED's pointed straight out parallel.<br />VERY BRIGHT!  And the additional mounting brackets offer endless possibilities, they're amazing!
B0002SRL20|5|This inflator reminds me of the ones back in the day, when I used to help out at our local service station.  The body of this inflator is solid, well made, and finished beautifully.  It works great.  The gauge is accurate and meets my needs.  I am quite satisfied with my investment.
B00NPQO0YS|4|Ok
B00L8D5AMG|4|works well. looks great.
B0022XI4NS|5|Looks Great
B0009TS2C0|5|It took only a few days for these to arrive.  I only needed one but ordered two so that the right and left trailer tail lights would match.  It took about 10 minutes to pull the old tail lights out and put these new ones in.  Was an exact fit.
B00OUM8GLY|1|Very poor Quality. I just started to use it and already it is tearing. To make matters worse, it's still not big enough to stay up without propping with the visor.
B000F18NDA|5|Fits great. I decided to buy more velcro then what was sent with it, and that definitely helped to give it a tighter fit. I got this for my boyfriends truck, a 2002 dodge ram 1500. His dashboard (common in this truck) was broken to pieces. A new one would have been over $200. So we tried the dashmat, and really like it. Definitely like the price better.
B000JR9OPG|4|Great price, installed easy.  I would look for the plug and play harness.. Does not come with this hitch..
B00QX63GO2|5|Looks awesome on my jeep
B000C39C9A|4|The cooler is great works better than I thought.  The hose it came with was Junk,it blew off twice and leaked 8 quorts of fluid.<br />Shipping came quick. Over all very pleased with the unit.
B00MV9OBE4|5|good match. however, does not look like new (someone returned it or it had been sitting in corner of a warehouse for a long time - that kind of look)<br />I give it 5 stars anyways, just hope it can last (for couple of years at least)
B00AQIDXVO|3|not quite an exact fit but it works
B00ML7IELC|5|The brightest drop in replacement on the market...by far.  I've tried several different brands and this is the only bulb that is as bright as, if not brighter, than stock incandescent.
B00KL3HA7C|5|Great A+++++
B001AWLBSW|5|As advertised
B00LEBLI82|5|Good so far
B00JGRWA24|5|great price showed up fast.
B008MOQO4C|5|Fit and worked to repair a stuck OEM gauge.
B000UHH5AQ|5|John O'Malley's comment that directions sucks is correct.  If you want to mount the rack on 16&#34; or 24&#34; studs, there is a right hand and left hand hinged side arm assemblies.  They do not tell you this or label them and either hinged side arm assembly can be assembled on either side.  If you install them incorrectly,  the distance between mounting holes will be greater than 48&#34;.
B00N4MOFAM|4|Definitely works and works as advertised, but it didn't magically fix my voltage issues. Don't expect to be able to maintain 200 amp draw with a crappy stock alternator and just this battery. Don't really know if the 1200w rating is that accurate. I'm running a 1000w RMS sub amp with a 200w 2 channel running the fronts and without a better alt I'm not really getting the best charge. I'm sure the battery is doing it's job fine, I'm just saying that if you're running enough amps higher than what your alt can put out, you'll still get your same problems. As for longevity, time will tell lol.
B00U8M73IM|5|Running on my honda ruckus great filter for the money... dealer wanted 35 for something like this
B000GPV2QA|1|I've owned two of these, and both failed in the same way: The positive power clamp broke. The company replaced the first one with the second, but after a few months, sure enough, the positive power clamp broke in exactly the same place as the first one. Today I tried to use the inverter for the first time, and it started smoking, with no 110 volt power output.
B00T6B4VNQ|5|Super sparkly! Well made. Cannot beat the quality for the price.
B00OF7OASC|5|Awesome
B00BAZBOTU|5|really great price  will see how long they last
B0066Q8A40|1|I feel disappointed in my purchase,<br /> the top case not came  with a respective  lock,<br /> missing the lock ,and the corresponding key,<br />It does not try to use the same key as the bike,<br /> This case should have at least one lock with a set of keys.<br />It is a misleading advertisement.<br /> I recommend that buyers pay this is not a minor detail attention.
B00MBB9YWG|5|Works great so far. Sounds good. The mic doesn't sound very good on other side. Great for price
B004MDEV38|5|easy install to 2007 honday odyssey
B001KSAUYC|5|Easy to install and fit my 2010 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport rear brakes perfectly. Much cheaper than my local repair shop wanted me to pay, $60 for these exact brakes. Got them for about $30 from Amazon with Prime shipping.
B00BN0R2SO|5|Battery was an easy replacement for my Tripp-Lite UPS. So now I am good for another 4 or 5 years!
B00WR0K09W|1|Did not fit the holes on my car.
B00B5NFUO2|5|It fits perfectly in my 2016 Fusion Hybrid. Awesome!!
B00EZUL6ZY|5|I got these for a really low price so was expecting a lower quality item, but was pleasantly surprised. They were very easy to trim to fit my mother-in-laws SUV and look great. We live in western Washington state and get lots of rain, these are deep enough to keep water, mud, and leaves on the mat and off the carpet.
B0039KZFSA|5|PERFECT
B001IF2BG2|5|It fit and worked well.  I didn't not have to removed anything on my 2014 Dodge Ram.  Yes it was all plastic inserts that holds it in but so are my door panels and other various parts of my truck parts.  Just realize most cars panels are the same.  I have driven hundreds of miles with high winds and car washes and everything seems fine.  I have definitely seen a difference in the amount of bugs on my windshield.
B004S3I8S6|5|Very good item it fits well
B0023VDYUC|5|Cool
B001FZL9ZO|5|kind of lighter weight than it looks but seems to hold me up just fine 190lbs. can have it on and off for storage when towing in a few minutes, and it adds a little bling to my rear end, of my truck.....
B00IGCWDXQ|5|The visor was an exact replacement. It took a few tries to deinstall the old and reinstall the new, but some on-line videos help here. Once you do it successfully you see how easy it is. And sooo... much cheaper than the dealer.
B00HZB81WG|5|good i am satisfied with this sticker
B00020CB2S|5|Product as advertised.
B007MF6UC8|5|works great
B000Q753B8|4|Satisfactory product , however the internal temperature does not go low enough for a long ride under high external temperature.
B003AT9PMM|5|Easy enough to install. Is a pain to lift up and bolt by yourself but what do you expect.
B00K8DD8C6|5|was great
B000C57VBE|3|Well, I have been very satisfied with other Moog products. However, the rubber boot in this one seems to be leaking, may have to return it for a replacement.
B00OGTX6WK|5|Exactly as pictured.
B0034BNICY|5|So far so good.  I was skeptical given huge price difference at local parts store but 2 months in, all good.  Cranks with mucho gusto and was a perfect fit.  Install was a breeze.
B0002SQYTG|4|It is what you expect from a milton. I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because it only goes up to 50 psi
B007S3MTI8|4|So far this works great. It was a direct fit replacement for my atwood 6 gal heater.  If you do not have an electronic ignition heater you will also need to buy the switch as well as the door
B000NXEO60|4|good fit.
B00OPNK36E|4|Fine filter
B0057HAAII|5|This fit the Suzuki dirtbike perfectly. My husband was amazed because he didnt believe me when I told him I could get a better price online and it would fit. This came and it went right on without any problems! We are very pleased with the product and the durability as well. It is not cheaply made and looks just like one you buy right from an auto parts store! Thanks!
B00663X6QK|5|wish they still made the JT classic line
B00D36A17A|3|They don't last that long
B0099D8056|5|Bought as a gift.  They absolutely loved it until someone stole it off of their car!  I guess someone else loved it too!  so hard to find Illini gear with the Chief on it!
B00LPSN7YM|5|As described. High quality and noticeable difference in sound and performance compared to old stock air filter.
B00BQN5SUW|1|Junk!  Worked great on installation, within 2 days the trunk no longer held up on its own.  These are garbage, buy better quality ones.
B008680S32|4|Of course I love the message, that's why I got the sticker.  But the quality of the sticker is pretty low.  It got really warped when I was trying to put it on my bumper and I just couldn't get it to go on straight.  It's the only bumper sticker on my car that's wrinkly.
B00B21R0TA|4|Initially I had some issues with the projectors that I received, however the seller addressed the issues and sent out replacements.<br />The light output is impressive! The pattern and cutoff are very sharp without any extreme hotspots. I have installed many HID kits, but this should be the only way to add HIDs to a vehicle as it eliminates any stray light.
B008LOS7LQ|3|I'm giving this 3 stars because it doesn't exactly work the way I needed it to.  If you are buying this as a seat belt extender for a car seat I would highly recommend using the seat belt extenders that are none flexible.
B00YZR7NPE|5|works perfectly with landscape lighting
B00K2SLS7O|5|fit great
B00HRHRPLG|5|Look great, parts were well packaged
B0051NREDC|5|My wife loves it and says it is much more comfortable than the stock pad. Great service also.
B00M9K3HYU|5|My son will start driving soon and these are perfect for learners permit practice! Just slap them on the back and you're ready to go and fellow drivers are more understanding once they see the magnets.<br /><br />Magnets hold firm but are easily removed.
B000XBK7D6|5|I haven't actually used the brush yet, but it appears to be very high quality.  I will try to add to this review after I've used it a few times.
B000V2W0GE|5|works well
B00NF1PRPY|4|Good product, fit perfect - Although would suggest taking apart and doing a good grease job to all internals, not much from factory.
B0002UNON8|5|Best scratch remover and polish I've used.  Works on plastic head and taillights, paint, clear coat, even powder coated items can recover luster after some elbow grease and this scratch remover.  I don't recommend using a power polisher, though, that didn't work very well, but for small areas where a hand buffing is possible, this stuff is excellent.
B002PNJZN8|5|Appear to be excellent quality bearings and in the kit form they arrive in they're ready for preparation and installation and time will tell how good or otherwise these bearings are. Individual trailer owners/users are the critical factor for bearings ... make sure they are correctly installed and then maintained with good quality grease ... MARINE grease in the case of boat trailers like mine.
B00BJGRP5W|5|I was conflicted between this and a &#34;I Love Masturbating&#34; magnet to display on the rear end of my car.<br />I decided to go with what I truly loved (crack whores) and I have yet to regret doing so. The quality is excellent and clearly indicates to the driver behind me, that I am extremely passionate about crack whores.
B00A9YJS0K|5|bought 2 one for each of my cars
B00JGNWS34|4|it's doesn't bring the screws I was hopping that because when I remove the lights before I should brake the screws I all ready have
B00915LYZ0|5|Fits my Honda TRX 420 and looks great. Wish it had draw strings on the bottom for better trailering.
B000V2SVFS|5|click send
B00DQ1RV70|5|great seller and great centres, many thanks
B008OAECW0|5|Used the kit to restring one day/night shade and it goes up and down easily again.  WAY cheaper than buying new shades.
B011GY4XI8|5|Really good mirrors for the money, all the hardware is included. The mirrors and bracket arms are positional in many configurations. I installed these on a 2008 Suzuki SV650 SF. I put them into the existing Fairing holes, and adjusted the angles to get the best side/rearview. These are tinted a slight bluish. I still get vibration even with the rubber shims, but that is standard for me. Quality Materials
B00VQWK42A|1|Sticks out further then expected and screw snapped, cheap material
B0030EZMXI|5|Fits perfectly.  I have removable headrests but I just slipped the whole thing over them.  Very easy to install.  The colour is perfect for my blue/grey interior.  Arrived sooner than expected!
B00199O97Q|2|Welds do not look sturdy at all
B000BYB7H0|5|This motorcraft cop was a great replacement . My car runs just as good before cop went bad . I wud highly recommend this for 2004 mustangs gt.
B0079S35Z8|5|Very pleased!  They rushed my order so I could have it for a gift before my party's date.  Also, they contacted me immediately when they couldn't find my open order in the system, because I'd ordered, then cancelled.  They also contacted me for exact color information and emailed me when the product shipped.  And, they are very, very nice!
B00DOTOCLW|5|worked perfectly! dealership wanted 3 times the price for the same piece of equipment!
B00LBACAMY|5|Awesome!
B009RUCAYI|1|The bulbs had come out of the poorly glued plastic on the package and must have bounced around the box and were all broken. I tried to return them to amazon but the return  quantity box did not work on amazon. Maybe I have to dispute the charge.
B00JHEG81A|1|These lights are extremely dangerous for your car battery and onboard computers! I HAD TO REPLACE MY BALLAST 4 TIMES!!! and by the last time it killed my battery enough to the point where I had to buy a new one. This product is extremely cheap and will kill your battery and pop fuses left and right; when I emailed the company about my battery, they all of a sudden stopped replying because they know that their product is to blame for the damage. Do not waste your time buying this kit, spend the extra $30 dollars and get something that is safe!
B00TKRBTFY|1|Junk. I got this part a few months ago to put on my Monster 696 when I got it back. It doesn't even get close to fitting the OEM part. I tried cut and sanding the corners, but nothing will help. $50 buck in the trash.
B0016C5YF2|1|Well, this didn't help much in lining up to hook up the camper.  #fail.
B00HXJ8MBK|5|Love it!!! The material is great, the colors give a nice fresh vibe, the seller was very helpful with a little mess up in my other and fix it right away... my car looks awesome!!!! A recommend this 100%
B0000AY3SR|2|Can't restore my headlight even though the label said it can.....
B001EN8WY8|5|Perfect fit for our '68 Beetle, thank you!
B003PZ0OTO|5|fit the seats for my 11 f150 perfectly.  Now they need a middle seat cover as well for the front.
B000B8N3IM|4|very good, little difficult to open at times
B00CFALFXY|5|Great rage. Good quality. I put some in the car washing bucket. Some in the laundry room. I just hand washed and hang to dry.
B00BGZ1VJC|1|Lasted 2 months!
B001GES01K|5|I've used Aeroquip products for quite a few years now, and they are reliable, made well, great fit, a reasonably priced. This hose will last quite a few years. Even though this is a push on 'no clamp' style hose when used with the proper fittings I've never trusted this style of hose with anything more than 25 psi. I usually use a high pressure fuel injection crimp style clamp when using this hose with oil or fuels. Would I buy this hose again? Yes. Would I recommend to others? Yes.
B006M462Y6|1|The battery arrive with only 20% battery life
B00NRV9TWO|5|The brightness of these bulbs is absolutely amazing. My wife had a problem with night blindness while driving and this has cured that problem. Amazing quality.
B00GZR490Y|5|A plus part and service
B00144BIC0|2|Terrible installation instructions. The light bar has double sided tape along the entire length, but also came with 4 3&#34;tabs that had double stick tape one one side. I still don't know what the tabs are for. I installed the light bar, centering it per the instructions. Everything was fine until I lowered the tailgate and heard the click of my tailgate hitting the light bar. There is a black plastic piece in the top of the bar that extends over by about 1/4&#34;. I guess it is some sort of shade. Since I has all ready secured the bar, there was no re positioning it. I had to rip it off making it unusable. I ordered a different brand for my last truck and have re-ordered that one.
B004OKFGLK|3|Unfortunately I got a weird batch after conversing with distribution they kindly sent their pink version of compound which, in my opionon is amazing. Unfortunately I've now got 4 lbs of no good batch. But the company was very easy to correspond with to troubleshoot
B00OPF4YGC|4|The bars came packaged well. The installation instructions were terrible. One grainy black and white picture I couldn't even see and the instructions essentially only said...bolt them on. It didn't take long to figure it out, however the front hole on the driver side didn't line up with the nutplate on the truck. I had to take a dremmel tool and widen the hole. The bars look great once installed.
B004QPCLC0|4|Hard to install, but ok.
B010H0QV7S|4|This is a useful tool to have around in the car.<br /><br />You can measure tire pressure (in PSI, BAR, KPA, and KG/CM^2) digitally.<br /><br />There's a mini LED flashlight, and a red LED light that lets you see where the tire inflater is at night.<br /><br />There are also two car emergency tools. There's a razor seatbelt cutter, and a tool that will break a window.<br /><br />So it's basically five tools in one. The only ones you're likely to use fairly often are the tire gauge and the lights if you need to use it at night. The other two you will never need if you're lucky, but you'd be lucky to have them around if you need them.<br /><br />It takes two AAA batteries. My only big complaint is that the lid that covers the battery compartment fits a bit loosely on my gauge. The little spring mechanism that holds it in doesn't press out far enough, so the lid falls off. I ended up taping it on there, which works fine but it would be better if it just worked.<br /><br />I did compare the pressure readings to a couple of other tire gauges -- one an analog gauge I had around and one at the gas station where I usually check and refill my tires. It seems roughly consistent, though the readings this delivers are a little bit lower (by about 2 to 3 PSI) than the readings I did for comparison. I don't know whether those gave high readings or this gives a low one, or whether the true reading is somewhere in between, but it's close enough to seem like they're accurate. (Sample provided for review).
B00FWOKKGI|2|It's just one solid beam and not as bright as I thought it would be
B0062TVJZS|5|Cute
B00ONF1I2C|5|Looks great. Sticks great.
B0002ILK72|5|PERFECT
B00LK87LNU|5|looked for them everywhere, great!
B00QGPKFGW|5|Awesome! Perfect fit for my Honda fit! !!
B0070NFGMC|1|Pure trash.  Threw it away
B0101A0C38|5|Awesome
B003O0YO0U|5|Perfect fit, quality part, easy to install and a LOT $$ less then the dealer.
B00BCRMC1U|1|Does not fit my Chevy Equinox at ALL. The back seat and front seat covers are huge, my vehicle apparently doesn't have clips to attach too, the head rest things don't fit the front seat ones. I'm so disappointed. Not universal...
B00DE964TA|5|great seller - delivered as promised!
B00KWF03NW|5|OEM Part minus dealer price!!!  Saved a bundle.
B00KX8RBGA|5|The pieces were cut properly and fit was awsome.
B00598Y5GI|5|A quality product with good installation instructions.
B005GQVXC2|5|Awesome, I've bought 3 designs, many more to come. Well worth  the price,  great quality, vibrant color
B00SW4J2MS|5|These will look great on my windows of my car.
B00CFPSEZ6|1|Poorly made. Too flimsy.  Not worth a single dollar.
B000CN4XZI|5|👍
B00JJBWMDO|5|I bought them for just in case hope I never have to use them
B00LH05Q88|5|Works awesome . A little flimsy but works everyday.
B00AUCCBPU|1|It doesn't fit.
B011CVJN94|5|This looks so great on my car!! It's so very cute. A bit larger than expected, but it looks great.
B00V9IUSAE|1|Didn't get delivered address not verified, funny how everything else gets delivered ok?
B000HZT89C|5|Works well.
B00PRZ1PC0|2|Worked for about 3 weeks but was great while it lasted.
B008CE06ZA|4|excellent heavy duty hitch.
B004R31XY8|4|I just installed this on my 2012 Silver Mazdaspeed3 yesterday and drove it around for the first time today.  I also had 1x ROLA fork mount bike carrier mounted to it.  I give it 5/5 for value, but -1 star for overall build quality (uses a lot of plastic in the feet of the rails, I question the durability of the foot covers).  They look awesome on my car.<br /><br />-Installation was about as good as one could expect.  4 key-protected covers need to be opened revealing the mounting hole within (one on each mount point).  The assembly &#34;L&#34; key is stored within (don't worry if you don't see it in the packaging, it actually ships with the key inside the covers).  There is a gasket and a stand-off included for each mount point as well, those need to be aligned, then the cross bars can be set on top. Insert a bolt through each hole, tighten, done.  The bolt lengths were fine, had no problem engaging the mounts.  It did take me about an hour to put it all together in the dark... if I had to do it again I could probably do it in 20 minutes.<br />-Instructions informed me to torque to hand-tight with the wrench and run down the bolts in each mount point prior to actually installing anything to clean the threads.  Don't bother doing that... I wasn't paying close enough attention to the depth of the mount in the roof of the vehicle and over-tightened the bolt while trying to do this step, thinking I was cleaning the threads, but actually just bent the threaded insert on my car (doh...)  I did the rest of them without that step just fine.<br />-After installing, stand back and look at how awesome they look.  Which is very.  Very awesome.  I will update this review with a pic at some point.<br />-Rails feel very rigid after torquing the mounting bolts.  I read someone bent theirs by leaning on it.  I believe the sticker says max load is 132 lbs, so don't lean on it, or step on it, or try to use it as a pull up bar.  It's not designed for that kind of load.<br />-I read some complaints about wind noise... maybe I'm deaf or desensitized by the atrocious amount of road noise from MS3 low profile wheel setup but I didn't notice any extra wind noise at all with the roof rack on, plus I had the bike rack installed also.  No weird high pitch noises, no squealing, no squeaking.<br />EDIT after ~20 days: I have noticed the extra noise a bit more after riding with the bike rack attached for a few weeks.  There is a noticeable &#34;lean&#34; to the bike when it is attached due to the convex shape of the bar, which slightly annoys me... doesn't seem to affect the integrity of the rack.

B00B1E43YS|5|Amazing pads.  I bought this used car on which a terrible paint job had been done.  After finding out about these pads, I was going from dubious they would do anything to afraid they would just go through the paint.  It took me a whole month after i received the pads to actually decide to give them a try.  I used them with a Griot random orbital polisher and Meguiar's 100 pro speed compound.  And, the result is nothing short of amazing.  The orange peel is gone and i still have some paint on my car.  Patience is key though as it does take some time to work this orange peel off, but, I am very satisfied about the results.  If you are tired of the orange peel on your car, i recommend you give these pads a try.
B00BC30E5A|5|Perfect fit. Just like the original.
B00YVQD4A2|5|This product works so well I ordered another one!
B000CGHR76|5|Good mount.  Hard to put on my 1997 Honda CRV, but I got it there finally.<br /><br />Does not come with the bolt, nut or washer.  Those cost me $20 with price and shipping.  Found them off of Amazon.<br /><br />Would buy again, but I sure as heck hope I won't have to.
B0009IQZPW|5|Excellent used it to polish my car
B001XVBCUM|5|replacing battery in older UPS.
B007G5SHK2|5|Guys. Seriously. Looking for a bumper that has a great price and is amazing quality. Get this one. It's seriously so well built and sturdy. Comes with fairlead and even steering skid plate. Really great. Love it. Don't have any complaints.

B000BRESIM|4|Nice
B00VOL4MBW|5|Very good product, meets DOT regulations
B00TE5744W|2|The frame is solid but the &#34;artwork&#34; is just stickers that come off. Nothing fancy.
B000NU5LP6|2|did knot do what i wanted
B000VAODAW|5|Perfect fit.
B00ATPWQVM|5|PERFECT!

B00ABZD2JK|5|Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised.
B0017UBHQS|5|Excellent product and great seller to work with!
B00JQ1RNOK|1|Junk - do not buy
B0052FRT2A|5|Everthink is okey.Thankyou.
B00NEL6HT0|5|Works great
B000VU56IA|4|Has bubbles between layers
B00SS0XL64|5|Very good service, parts  identical
B001DKRGQ2|4|perfect
B008OYAK1I|3|Good
B004NU3NQ6|5|quick shipping and good quality
B003YJNUNI|5|I have used a lot of wipe and shine products but none come close to Voom Gold.........<br />I use it mostly for the rv since it works great on fiberglass. I highly recommend this product..
B004MDZ5NI|5|As expected
B00HC2VFK8|5|Great quality. Perfect fit.
B0009H51ZS|5|Lights are ok. No prob so far.
B00DWYOWGY|5|Great for replacing existing 921 lamps in our new camper. 2 of these replace 3  921 bulbs is one light. Produces literally no heat. Keep light covers from turning color from the heat.
B00BQAL2NW|5|Great product
B00CTVGAZ2|3|Front covers fit nicely.  Rear covers fit too loose. Would have like to purchase separately.
B000I0VKGK|5|Very powerful than plastic .
B0041TRVAS|1|only lasted 2 weeks bearings went out
B00J4P4VHU|1|The brake pads squeal horribly.  I had to get them looked at again and the tech found the issue to be the pads themselves.  I talked to their support online and was told that if the pads were installed, the warranty was voided.  Exactly how do you know the pads would squeal if you never install them?  Answer, you don't.  I would recommend another brand.
B001U7MWDU|5|Exactly what I needed. Replaced original equipment. Easy to install. (just turn the original brackets around)  Shipped fast.
B00XZ9N1JU|5|Great item. Works perfect and the instructions you all provide via your website are super easy.
B00BK85HHM|5|This is an excellent product. It fits perfectly and flips up to enable use of the small package storage area. It has a lip, which prevent moisture from migrating onto the carpet and is quite sturdy.
B00GHSKKPY|4|4 out of 5 just because I think it's a bit pricey for that cheap piece of plastic
B00IU7DWKU|3|Not the easiest to apply. When applying use a little soapy water and a hair dryer. Fit is ok for my 2015 Camry. Probably would not order again, but for the price you get what you pay for.
B0002ILK2C|4|Purchased as a spare.
B0051MYLS4|5|Gets in the tight places in my wheels. Washable cover
B003YBMDRU|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT SENT PROMPTLY BY SELLER.
B00SDNBM0I|5|Excellent
B002EWEBNE|5|I purchased and installed on a 2011 Chrysler Town & Country van.  I was a little slow in the beginning on begin able to follow the instructions, but once I got the idea, it all came together.  My wife has a Delta Trike (Sun EZ3) and I have a conventional 2 wheel bike.  I was concerned about the width of her trike vs the width of the car.  I did reposition the bracket for the trike's front wheel back towards the center of the car and was able to reduce the over all width of the rack by about 3 inches.  We did a test drive and the rack was very stable and I feel comfortable with it being there.  One unexpected, but not necessarily bad thing that I did not expect; whenever I put the car in reverse, my safety sensors  pick up that there is something back there and  sets off the warning.  So I have this warning going off whenever I back up.  Overall the rack is well made, delivered on time, looks good, is sturdy and does the job.
B002D0SF3Y|5|This was exactly what I was hoping for; a high quaility transfer decal  (no background vinyl) I applied this to my motorcycle and it looks great.
B004IYC5HU|5|Easy install, perfect replacement on my JayFlight G2
B005BWIA1I|5|Just like the original. It even has the red indicator on top of the lock node
B000C57S6C|4|Reduced the dreaded &#34;Death Wobble&#34; on my 2005 F250 significantly, pretty easy to replace except for removing the old tapered bolt from the drag link. Make sure you have a pitman arm puller or a ball joint/pickle fork handy to remove the old one... or be prepared to use a torch, BMFH and a bunch of swear words to get it out.
B0006H8DE2|5|Yea
B000CAO89W|5|It fits my jeep great
B007CX6DWW|5|It is what it says it is and had no problems here.  Worth the purchase.
B002W0W2AM|5|Best polish you can buy
B0041CC9IO|5|Very very powerful exhuast! I mounted mine to my 07 zzr600 the cost is a little more than the exhuast is worth to me but I like the style so I got it. I had it two days and I was at an intersection, I gave the bike gas and it wheelied so fast I missed the balance point and went off the bike and broke my femur. The exhaust help up great taking no damage from the 20 mph crash. All summer I put 6000 miles on my zzr and never had it ever pull up like that untill I bought this exhaust! Make sure if you buy it you learn its power differences before you ride hard.
B00MEI4DMM|1|These did not fit the Chrysler Town and Country....Should have ordered 2007 according to the person who wanted these in my family.  I had the wrong year.  They do fit my Toyota 2004 Sienna so this was not a total loss buy.
B0002L77SA|2|It did not fit right in the car for me a tat to big.  08 350z  Delivery was great, on time good condition.  Quality look good.
B002RSIK4G|4|great product but very slow shipping!
B000GVEY64|4|exactly what i needed.  i have it mounted on the rear seat and the backrest feature is great to have.  holds my helmet easily.  all the side pockets are good to have.  my only wish is that they would have made all the zippers easy to lock.  i have to use a luggage lock to secure it.
B000C55VJI|5|Easy to install and fits perfectly. Would highly recommend this part.
B00HGU0S7C|5|These pads hold up well as any out there. Im real hard on front brake pads,because of the traffic circus that is Panama city Panama,<br />and Ive worn 2 sets of these down to almost nothing,and they brake just as hard as when new even when worn down a lot. Great product.
B00HRU78CO|5|When needed it makes seeing inside the car much easier.
B00DQ9YI6Y|1|Part said it would fit my 2004 Hyundai Elantra but when I brought it to the mechanic it was much smaller than the part I needed. Had to buy a new part to replace this one. This was terrible I ended up spending 5x more than I intended.
B003177UQG|5|Great!
B00ZB8AYFM|5|sweet looking plate
B00GJ1N1CS|5|The manifold was exactly the same as the ford original equipment part. It came with two studs and nuts for connecting the exhaust.
B00340A6QG|1|could not use it to secure the upholstery onto the couch as I thought it would work, Ended up using the rings and then pliers to secure them
B00VDQUP82|5|Very convenient.  Got here quickly.  Thank you!!
B002OPNSM6|1|The O-Ring was too big and did not fit. Had to use the old one. This is the second time I buy a repair kit (different Brand) and this one did not fit properly. (beware)<br />My Banshee is stock and as stated in the advertise, it should have fitted well
B00CJ6JJGO|5|Fantastic Product. Easy to install and works as described. Installed onto my 2014 Camaro SS.
B006BBHEJW|5|smells great! my husband gets compliments from everyone that gets near or in the car with us! love it.
B005HEAHAM|5|Fast Delivery. Nice.
B0082194PQ|5|Great improvement over stock 696 seat...I do not slip into the tank anymore.<br />I did also add Techspec grips on my tank....
B00P5YMVRQ|5|good for my 2003 x-type jaguar
B00A6G5SB4|5|worked great
B00O9NCCWI|5|thank you
B00XVDAADK|5|Awesome 3pc car mats! Fit perfectly in my truck and has been tested repeatedly by my son. The custom rubber liners allowed me to make it a perfect fit! Would be an awesome choice for anyone looking to upgrade their existing floor mats
B00498KQIA|5|thank you
B00F7GZFN4|5|Just what I wanted
B00X7JY8HM|4|My 2001 Honda Accord has a rather large windshield height of 33&#34;.  I've been looking for a one-piece shade with 2 round wire hoops, and this one had hoop diameters closest to what I need so I purchased it.  It is working well, and I find it quicker to put up and take down than the type I used to use which was 2 separate rectangles. It happily stays in place without putting the sun visors down.  I would have given it 5 stars except I found the loose material between the two wire hoops is too narrow for my compact car, and therefore when I tuck the hoops under the outer edges, top edges, and bottom edges of the windshield, the hoops are forced to warp out away from the windshield in the middle under the rearview mirror where they overlap each other - they would lie flat if the windshield were wider.  But it does the job  and completely shades the interior.  It comes with both a retaining loop of material sewn to the shade to help keep it folded, and a storage bag.
B006N9GJAW|5|nice, looks good quality , we will check in the future
B004R39F9S|5|it was easy to install. very good hitch.
B0002SA456|1|Very poor craftsmanship, besides being pissed that the two items are sold separately (seriously WTF) they also don't fit together well at all. The plastic retaining strip does not stay in the slot on the header bar. Also would people stop giving products 4 and 5 star reviews when they admit they haven't even gotten to use the item or have just unboxed it?
B000RFMAME|5|Great quality product at a reasonable price and proven to be very effective for its intended use.
B008G1WEK4|5|look nice at a good price
B00COE3ZHA|4|my mechanic suggested this and he was on the money.  best wiper I have had since purchasing vehicle
B002MCVPOO|4|It Is totally worth the money if your going to replace the water pump in your truck. Much easier than removing the starter. Work smarter not harder! one thing you should know if your using the flywheel lock that just slides into place. You should check it each time you go to loosen or tighten the bolt on the harmonic balancer  because the flywheel lock can shift then get wedged and you have to pry or hammer it out of the slot.
B00OIIRAQM|5|Good
B00J0YNHY8|4|love the look but the smell doesn't last long.  it smells great though
B000PDIBF8|5|It works per design. There are variants of this device available, but this is the one I got and it works as expected. Can't say much more.
B001252SMU|5|Item was exactly as described.  Though I now wish I would have gone with the 60&#34; because the 66&#34; was a little tall for our toy hauler rear bunk.
B001EOWPOA|5|just right
B00CFDLBTO|5|New to boating and having purchased a second-hand vessel with trailer, I discovered the trailer to be in critical condition! Overhaul at a dealership for trailers, or a marina, would cost $$$. I discovered all the parts I required online at Amazon and undertook the work myself with outstanding results! This kit with complete backing plates and brake systems made the job a snap and for far, far less than a shop would have charged me. The pieces appear to be excellent quality and should last me several seasons before they too succumb to death by salt water. My trailer is safe to tow anyplace now.
B00167TYHQ|4|ok
B0031I4HNE|5|I had to return these because they were too thick for my 2000 Silverado  4x4 Z71.  I wish they would have fit because they were a good and solid looking product but I had to return them.  They said they will fit but do not.  Don't make the same mistake and have to run to local part store to finish your project.
B002K66FYW|3|Both lasted about 18 months. OEM's lasted 10 years.
B00COYNZJ8|2|Didn't fit my car well and unless this thing is completely flat its hard to make out the characters from the outside.
B004L06WW0|1|To small and not bright
B00OTZ48FU|5|I love it. Keeps the motor home several degrees cooler. Sometimes the suction cups don't stick very easily.
B000GTWL3O|3|The stud that the wire run's threw will spin in the plastic when you try to tighten the nut down enough to keep the light in place
B00EXIEVO6|5|Now, this little baby is small but great in quality. It's small but it gets the job done. I love the price and the workmanship of this product.
B000WEKQ3K|5|Awesome floor mats,very fast shipping
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Fast shiping great item A+
B00NYHH0NQ|5|Adorable and fit easily and perfectly on my steering wheel.
B00QAMKNYK|5|Great Product! Very handy and well made!
B00C9S4S0E|5|Hard to find a kickstand for a KX85.  Flips up nicely under the rear plastic and tight against bike.  Beats the heck out of trying to find something to lean the bike against, tearing up grips, etc.  This kick stand is spendy but is high quality, strong and works great.  Have Pro Moto kick stands on a YZ250F, CRF450R, CR125 and now a KX85.  Hard to come off the dollars, but well worth it and no regrets.
B00KPZECVI|2|Didn't work my car
B000EQET5M|4|good fit
B006E4SKQ2|3|Fits fine, Seems expensive for what it is.
B008B5X5GC|5|Just what I needed
B0039Z1UHA|5|exactly what I needed and expected to receive. It''s a titanium colored fiberglass wrap- perfect for the air-intake plenum in my car.
B005LLFCLK|3|Good quality just thin material.  Sewn well.
B008H67Y0S|5|Great product.  Has greatly extended the life of my convertible top.  I'm a big fan.
B000JZZREU|2|Pipe does NOT slip over existing exhaust pipe since it is not flanged by manufacturer. If you purchase this you will need to take it to a muffler shop to have the end belled out with a machine so it will slip over existing exhaust.
B006K3LJFQ|4|the only problem was the mix up with the part but this one worked  good from day one the first one never did actually work well at all so we are glad that you sent this one Thanks
B0002T5CT8|1|The product purchased broke after a normal episodic use. I'm not even going to pursue a refund as my time is more valuable.
B0069S3AWW|5|Great product,great quality and installs in seconds...
B009IKMHOK|5|appears to be of high quality, fit compressor perfect (03 ford focus)
B0049HKFIM|4|Ok
B00SUNHB7Y|5|This is my First Amazon Review ever written!!!!<br /><br />These lights are &#34;&#34;&#34;THAT GOOD&#34;&#34;<br /><br />Build Quality 10/10<br />Everything from the extensions to the remote control and the key chain remote are nice and sturdy.<br />I used Loctite professional spray adhesive to add some security as I ride pretty hard sometimes.<br /><br />Basically you clean the area and peel and stick. This kit comes with all the extensions and lights you'll ever need for your bike.<br />I have some many left over after fully lighting the bike that I'm trying to figure where to put these other lights.... I'd rather have more than less.<br /><br />The lights are bright and the light modes are AWESOME!!!!<br />Strobe, Color Fade, and pulsing lights. You can control the speed of each setting to make a totally custom light mode!!!<br /><br />I though I was just paying for some entry level lights... these lights ARE PRO!!!!<br />GET THEM NOW!!!<br /><br />Picture doesn't even do it justice!!!
B0054E1PE2|5|Impressive!  I like the nice touch of the chrome screw covers too.  (A classy car deserves nothing less :)  This is beautiful.<br />It came well packaged and quickly.
B00VTYYZSO|5|No more handles hitting everything.... Palm grip is great!
B00NW8KE8A|4|its okay...
B009AGZ348|5|great, fun product.  super fast personalization!
B002JHBFOM|1|Bought both these and within a year they were both leaking and needed a complete rebuild locally
B00SLKXD7S|5|makes my truck look cherri, great deal. easy to install.
B00O83GJO6|5|Made it look like a brand new car... 5 series look with 50% of the price
B000W0WSPI|5|It took me longer to get this wrench out of the box than it did to get the fan off and I spent an hour trying without it. This wrench  is worth every penny. Used it on an 2003 GMC Sierra 1500 and it worked perfectly.
B00JXII6TM|5|Excelente
B00GD9CQWM|5|very fast for my acura tl 2008
B00CSU6GJ4|5|Fit perfectly. Clamp is solid and holding well.
B004ZF35GM|3|Fit and pretty bright
B00AA5CRQ0|5|great seller - delivered as promised!
B000JL95TC|5|I liked this product, no it didn't keep all the mosquitoes away it did its share on cutting down on them.  This was a very wet summer in the beginning so we had more mosquitoes to deal with.
B005GGM33A|5|I just bought these to protect my floors in the upcoming winter. They fit right in without any trouble. Thank you WeatherTech!
B00FS0W31G|5|Great item.....
B00GBBDPTA|5|Fawk yeah !!
B007KTINX0|5|works GREAT!!
B001KSGNGG|1|I do not recommend this fan clutch.  It is 5 times louder than the one it was replacing for being too loud.  If my original fan clutch was AC/DC, this one was Cannibal Corpse.  The sound emanating from my engine bay was similar to that feeling you get when you watch a video of someone face planting after a botched jump attempt, right before their face hits but after their teeth do, kind of that UUUUUnuuuunnnnfffffffff, feeling.  I would sooner my engine overheat and I be stranded and have to walk than drive around with this mating hippo sounding fan clutch.  From the very moment I installed it, I prayed that Princess Elsa would stop me - mid traffic, forcing me to open my hood, at which point she would ice blast my 40 Hz / 150 dB blasting fan clutch, freezing it into a frigid block of frozen.  But then, Sub-Zero from mortal kombat would fly in from wherever he was 'chilling' at and I would lean out the window and yell FINISH HIM!!!  and with one madd round house kick he would shatter my newly frozen fan clutch into a billion ice shards as I cheered him on with the vigor of a Roman Gladiator who just won his freedom.  I have since replaced this part with the OEM and it is silent.  So silent in fact, that i am motivated to drive around listening to Silento - whilst whipping and nae'ing. If this fan clutch was a Van Halen reunion tour, I was hoping for Roth and ended up with Cherone.  This fan clutch is the Haribo sugar free gummi bears of fan clutches.
B00RJUZY9Q|5|good
B000CF8W1W|5|Shipped quickly, installed easily and meets all expectations.
B001UG8S8O|4|nice, a bit non-sticky, though
B000WER72I|1|Not worth the money. Fit is very poor for &#34;custom fit&#34; mats. Mats slide around on the floor. You have to scrub them with a brush and water to get them clean, crumbs don't come off when you shake them. They do not cover the carpet on the dead pedal so that still gets filthy. The one for the rear seats had to be cut in order for it to fit. That is NOT custom!
B0022ZI0JY|5|It came with orange blades (as mentioned by other reviewers), but did the job I needed it for very well. I am removing decals from the side of my RV.
B00GTDNV9Y|5|Installed on 2002 Jeep GC, easy installation took about 2 1/2 hours, looks great and was able to fit 255/75R/17 Wrangler wheels on my WJ.
B000BB40Z4|5|Great product
B000CGTNNW|5|Excellent. I m very please with the part and pricing.
B00J1K6DCO|1|slides off dash won't stay put.
B00N9ZYZ6I|2|Very nice but small.  I ended up buying a larger one for  $20 more.
B00D6Z4AFW|5|Perfect fit and took no time to arrive.
B00BBMD2O2|5|Good fit and finish. Easy install
B0012TUBIE|5|real good value
B00AJUIJKO|5|it works.  What else can you say
B004SRUIB2|5|great bar
B004ETK0AI|5|Perfect for hold coloring books, crayons, note pads and whatever else happens to make it's way in there. Very happy.
B004SF3D1Q|5|So far so good with this harmonic balancer. Just got it installed and it fits and functions well. But I will need some time to see how far it goes.
B003KU2348|5|1999 TOYOTA 4 RUNNER V6. perfect fit, same length as the  OEM wires.
B0101U6OVW|5|Good quality sticker.
B0000AY69V|5|The title says it all.<br />I keep it in the side container of my Odyssey so it's always handy when I wash it.
B00BTL6FRG|1|Don't buy, bought in April 2015 and only 2 of 6 are still working.
B007KPVX9K|5|I bought this one for my gun, works perfect!
B00Q5ZEZXM|5|Better than I  expected. Very well made.
B0031BL1D0|4|Great bags for our trip. Quality construction and they were very stable during the ride.
B0006I0NBM|1|Not really stainless steel.  Rusted badly in just 2 years.  Choose another brand if you don't want to replace in a couple of years!
B00XQEIZ36|5|Great item
B001GC0WV8|3|Difficult to install.  Does help hitch from hitting ground on dips with van.

B00GTG7RNW|5|Nice shirt fits as it should. Great retro look
B00JK322MW|5|After purchasing the OxGord booster cable I have been very pleased with it! The cable itself is 12 feet long which allows you to reach two vehicles without having to get the vehicles really close together. This has always been a problem with previous booster cables I have purchased, the last thing you want to find out when you have a dead battery is that you can't pull another vehicle close enough to connect them together! The clamps on the cable are very well made, the copper ends have aggressive teeth for grabbing onto the battery terminals and hold quite well. I like the new design they have incorporated in the cable clamps and they keep you from arcing the two ends together. The springs are very heavy duty and hold tightly to the battery. The cable bag measures about a foot in diameter making it easy to store above a spare tire in the trunk of a car or under the back seat of a Truck/SUV.<br />I tested these cables on my wife's Jeep and was very impressed with how well they worked!<br /><br />I'm always a believer in being prepared and If you own a vehicle you need to own a set of jumper cables! I highly recommend these cables (they are the best I have ever purchased). I bought these cables at a discounted price for my honest review and am quite pleased with the product I received.
B00JIIZCM6|5|I loved the product.
B005HAYDR4|5|Great value, great fit. Strong. I can hang from them and I weight 185. Soils product
B000COB8AK|5|It works  hopefully for a long time
B001C6Q7US|5|Fit was as good as OEM.
B00KROWN5O|5|These types of stickers are great . I love the stencile effect much more than other types of stickers . They hold up well !!
B001EP0HVM|5|Prompt deliver, quality hardware, packaged properly....met my expectations!
B003X7NXJW|2|This thing clanks inside the trailer hitch and makes a terrible racket!  It is undersized for the hitch and would be great if it had some type of strong rubber lining insert to eliminate the slop.
B001KOY58S|1|This will be going back! It shows 4 buttons but only has 3 which makes it extra SHORT! Not what is pictured!
B00JOB1P1O|3|doesn't stick  that long
B003QU3HW4|5|This was great size, loved the color and rained enough to cover the whole mat last outing. Picked it up put it over picnic table to drain it, folded it up stored it to get home and pulled it out to dry it off. Amazing how quickly it dried, folded back up and ready to go next time
B00QK3ZMHW|5|Work great. Easy install
B00LADO6H4|1|stator broke after running for 2 hours. BAD PART!!!!! DO not waste your time and money like I did. seller would not even pay for return shipping even after testing the part and admitting it was bad. I lost big time and was stuck in the moutains for hours becuase this failed.
B00B2A2JEM|5|These were easy to install and work very well. Very Very Very bright!
B00II5YADC|5|The water blade is the best way to take care of a larger car in a hot sun. If you don't get that water off fast it will bake into the paint, or you use 3 towels getting it dry.
B000630ICQ|4|It works nice. I had to use it twice.
B004GCV4US|4|Just what I needed thanks
B00CXMPR2E|5|love my cute lil flower. went on nice and smooth, no issues with rain or anything so far
B002SIR91A|4|This shovel serves its purpose as a good ice fishing shovel for clearing snow away from my holes. I used to use a Hoppy from Hopkins Shovel Corporation, but the plastic didn't work well when there was frozen slush or the crusty top of the snow. The hard aluminum edge of this shovel busts through that stuff easier. Sometimes, if water gets in the handle, it can be hard to extend, though.
B00F0VMMSW|3|no directions on how to use
B003E20RO0|5|Very good pads. Low/no dust. quiet.
B00CKML4CE|5|Had it all season and it has held up very well.

B001CE4HY8|5|Worked perfectly for our slide and helped with stabilizing the camper.
B000RSTXG2|5|love it
B00AKR413K|4|Bought this hat for my wife, but the size fits more for a man head.  She loves the color, but shape and size not perfect.
B001FCE5AI|5|This product worked great on my car and camper.  You just cannot let it sit before wiping it dry or else it leaves spots.  It left a beautiful shine.
B0068SYSP6|5|Fits perfectly in my husband's 2013 Venza.  Heavy duty, easy to clean, protective.
B00D1CQVIY|5|VERY GOOD PRODUCT EVERYTHING WORKS PERFECTLY
B008CRM0QK|5|I bought this StopTech cross-drilled rotor to upgrade the rear of my 2003 Saab 9-5 Linear so now it has the same size brakes as the 2003 9-5 Aero.  I similarly upgraded the front brakes to Aero earlier this year.  Of course I also bought rotor 128.38015R for the passenger side.  For those who want to do a similar swap, the calipers are identical but the caliper brackets are different.  Since mine had 150k miles on them I just decided to get a pair of A-1 Cardone rebuilt calipers that come with brackets.  I assembled them with Akebono EUR763 ceramic pads.  I also put on a new set of parking brake shoes and hardware.  This new combination of brake hardware is fantastic!  Excellent braking performance with very little dust and no noise.  My only complaint is that the black coating on the rotor hat is applied to the inside of the drum where the parking brake shoes make contact.  Maybe it's not that important, but I removed the coating with a die grinder.<br /><br />I've had great luck with all the cross-drilled rotors I've used in the past.  Personally I think slotted rotors are not so good, with a lot of people complaining about noise and the benefits seeming somewhat dubious.
B004AMPLGM|2|No instruction at all. More time is needed to assemble and install. But it is functional at the end.
B0009IR0AG|4|Spins right on..  I hand tighten, then give another quarter turn with a filter wrench.  Make sure you check to make sure the old gasket isn't stuck on the engine.  Mine came off on the last oil change.
B000C540FY|5|So far, this part is working great. I may have to return the left side that I ordered. It seems the boot is leaking. Will update later.
B00GUCXNFG|4|The low beam connector crumbled from heat, I guess. You can't just get the connector, you have to buy the harness. You also have to separate the lens from the headlight assembly. The gasket material is strong, but flexible. (very sticky)  Be prepared to spend a LOT of time picking the gasket material/adhesive out from the edge of the clear lens and the groove of the back of the assembly.  The reason you have to separate it is that the internal wire for the high beam runs behind the reflector of the low beam and the connector is too big to just snake it through without disassembly.<br />The new harness didn't have a blue rubber gasket between the bulb and the connectors for low/high beam. The connector fits, but it was a little bit different design.
B008FCD8LI|5|Really handy, holds a surprising amount of stuff. Nice that it's custom fit to the hold downs in the Volt.
B000T9TNCI|5|I've run Redline oil in my 7.3 since new. I now have 210,000 miles on the motor and injectors still pass the buzz test with flying colors. Well worth the price, only use 1 ounce per 20 gallons.<br /><br />In cold weather, I mix the oil, 50/50 with diesel to make it easier to pour. I use a cleaned out Stabil container to keep in the truck and measure out the needed amount.
B00K157LVA|4|Great price and way cooler than anything I found at the store.
B002LGO9I0|4|VERY GOOD PRODUCT, BUT YOU DO HAVE TO INSTALL SPAERS ON HE BOTTOM TO MAKE IT LINE UP CORRECTLY ON 700 GRIZZLY
B00RW4MTXS|5|Super perfect fit! Saved me about $75.00 if I had bought from Honda.
B0002M9UTS|1|Runs too hot for any type of plastic housing.
B004TGH8DS|5|Excellent
B000T2W336|5|Works great. Has more holes than oem's.
B0050DBHW2|4|Just what I was looking for. These adjust to 3 positions and are perfect for the long ride.
B004WNFQGO|5|Worked and fit well in my 2013 elantra gls
B006ZVITKG|5|nice
B000C123NY|2|Is about 13 thou. out of flat. Had to have it ground flat.
B00BDVM8P0|5|This product was perfect and very easy to install on my 99 LX470 ,  I installed it in 5 min. with the help of my daughter.  I highly recommend the antenna with mast.
B003B06RBC|3|You will have some problem with windows closing after attaching it to you car if you have automatically closing windows
B004I9UFNQ|5|Worked perfectly. Simple installation.
B010E7G12O|5|Great product

B00BJCN7Z8|5|Works well.
B0030CYLD2|5|Husband got his dream car and loves anything with corvette on it, it will hang in the garage where he parks his car.
B006YBBYTA|5|These are the best mats I've ever purchased and I've purchased a lot of them. They don't look like &#34;Mud&#34; floor mats but they are contoured to hold in mud and snow. They really look nice.  I have these in my Ford Fusion (2008) and the carpet is black but the floor mats are grey.  It's a nice contrast.
B0002SA22Q|1|This and the bikini top do not fit together well at all. I am saddened constantly by the complete lack of craftsmanship in most modern products and this is prime example. The plastic strip on the bikini top does not fit properly into retaining slot, not even with some applied help from a rubber mallet.
B0064M7736|5|works fine!
B00GYTEC14|5|I went to a couple of different local auto parts stores; discovering that the filters that they gave me didn't fit properly.  This one fit perfectly, and works great.
B0047DDDT6|5|Easy to install as struts go. good ride.
B00SAFOL98|5|this was on trucks years ago  you dont see this anymoore.i think its cool
B0018E6T9I|5|The whole order was great.  I loved it.  ~m
B004HOWT3Q|5|I broke my wiper arm, while I was cleaning heavy snow.<br />I had to get this as soon as possible, since it was snowing...and will snow again for a few more days.<br />AutoZone doesn't have it, Dealer doesn't have it...<br />The Hyundai dealer had to order it, and takes 4~5days...and the price is way too high.<br />I checked amazon, and I bought an extra wiper blade and this arm with the money that dealer asked for just an Arm.<br />I got even a few dollars of change.<br />Super east to install, if you have the right tool.
B001E8LPII|4|Nice item.
B0031I3L54|5|Direct fit replacement took 15 minutes to remove old and install new. Love, love, love it.
B00KHB28NO|5|Received item quickly and worked well
B002OMPAS4|5|Looks great, fits great and a good price. Can't argue with any of that.
B001AY2WLU|4|awesome tool, was originally going to be my keyring but after getting it I found that it is way to heavy for that. goes better in the glove box or pocket.
B00K7VE2VK|5|I live in drought-stricken California, so I was a bit skeptical about how effective this product would be. It works! Just follow the instructions provided, and you also will be impressed. Shipping was prompt and item was protected from leakage. Thank you!
B001UCDFBI|4|Simple change and cheaper than the parts store.
B003CEFJ2A|2|I got this as a gift from my son.  I takes a lot of work to start the zipper and get it over the jack.<br />It quickly faded in the sun to a dull gray on top.<br />I decided to wash the jack and oil it.  As I was taking off the 6 month old boot, the zipper split and would not go back together.<br /><br />I would not recommend every buying this cover.
B00MFZYUJU|5|got what I ordered  and applied with no problem.
B00CTVGAZ2|5|Just take a look at these seat covers. They look like quality within and without. They fit my Nissan Altima and they look great. They were easy to install. I know they will not last forever but I will love them and enjoy them until the end.
B000M4ZN10|5|Awesome bungee.  I use on my Triumph Tiger back seat.  Very simple and easy on/off.
B003TTL0TE|5|excellent
B002EVWDJ4|1|I bought this from my camper and its a wast of money . The Carnauba wash & wax did the same thing for a fraction of the money!!!
B007DE8M2O|5|looks awesome!!!
B00JTXKCB6|1|This is not the correct rotor for 2010 528i BMW. I ordered this 2 weeks ago and the middle part of the rotor size was way bigger then original one. When I called &#34;Prime Choice&#34; they said thats what we have if its didn't fit on your car we can't do anything. So unprofessional, I returned it already. This rotor will never fit, so DON'T BUY. See attached pics as a proof.
B000EDOT8C|5|Love the quality and extra space this gives.
B000COMX3Q|5|Secured Jeep Wrangler wheels with ease
B00NEL6HT0|5|Fits and works perfectly!
B00II1LW1O|5|Love these bulbs.  Bought the first pack of twelve and installed them.  Great light, very little drain on the battery when you are not plugged in or running the generator.  Bought twelve more to replace more of the original bulbs.  Couldn't help myself they were almost half price form the first set I bought.  Now I'm looking for some to replace the halogen bulbs that really drain the battery.
B00H1IGBOS|4|Great price only downside was one touch window down part of switch did not work after 2 times of using switch but not a real concern, I can hold it down for few seconds to get window down all the way. Fast shipping
B001DRNA1U|5|just changing my old brake pump, fine
B00J5252NO|5|worked great, matched perfectly.
B00V3JJXKA|5|Bought this key for my 2012 Dodge Durango had it programmed at Batteries Plus it works!!! The dealer charge $200. I paid $45 total.
B004SRRSOM|5|Cold AC again works perfect on 2002 nissan altima...
B0055463T8|4|this brush does what it says and it works its coarse enough to remove heavy brake dust and fits in the wheels. plastic handle keeps from scratching the wheel if you get to overzealous. The only down side is that the brush under heavy use bends and tweaks. can be unbent but is a little week. but for the Sunday wash works great
B000C644DG|1|When we reciwvwd the clutch cable that clearly said on Amazon that it was the right one for the 88 scirrocco. It wasn't the right one at all. It didn't serve our needs and it was completely different
B003TLBUJ2|5|Excellent quality and engineering, tight fit. Certainly worth the small cost to protect the expensive front of the Bonneville. Fast shipping, and arrived weeks before the estimated delivery time. Good Guys.
B008BVZU0K|5|fits and works perfect
B008VLVDII|3|Did not fit tight enough on my back seat
B011PJQRBA|4|Looks good, feels cool for the price haven't put them on yet but will post another review when they get on
B00LW3ZM5M|4|U get what U pay for.
B002EBQX72|5|fits perfect
B00R5BHX4I|1|Very poor quality and came damage but they are going to refund my money
B00XOTJ5DC|5|The best you can get for your motorcycle or other plastics. Awesome!
B00XBEJZA8|5|I ordered the Autofeel 22 inch LED Light for my tractor, I have been wanting one for a while for snow removal after dark and when I take too much time doing yard work after dark. This light is VERY sturdy! I wasn't expecting the quality this light has when I ordered, I couldn't be more happy with my purchase. The 22 inch bar is great for a tractor or ATV type vehicle. The light bar doesn't come with a wire harness but is easy to set up with little electrical knowledge. All you will need is a toggle switch and a positive and negative wire. I actually prefer this and see it as a good thing, I have bought lighting before which came with a wire harness, most of the time they don't work with whatever you are installing them. This way you save money and have more options for installation,<br />The light bar comes with two side mounted brackets and hardware, the hardware that comes with the light is sufficient to attach to almost anything you will want to attach it to. The LED's are a nice touch and give off a great amount of clear light.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this light if you are looking for a high quality and very durable light. I received this light at a discounted rate for my honest review, however, this review is truly my honest review, I would most definitely recommend this light and will be ordering a larger size for my truck.
B00FWOKJYG|5|Rediculously bright! I love it I reccomend this to everyone I know1 I submerged this in water besides the cord for 6 hours plus and is perfect! Doesn't wobble or anything spot and flood are perfect! Deserves another star
B00SKODWHG|3|Great product.  Fits perfect on my 11 f150 super crew.  The matte black ventshades matched the pillars between the side windows perfectly.  the aeroskin fits the hood great.  Too bad they don't sell extensions to cover the corners of the fenders as well.  A little update.   I installed this properly too.   I was driving on the freeway and the aeroskin just ripped off of my truck and flew into the median.   The only thing left was the corner which has was still taped on the truck.   There was no warning either, and I checked the tape every wash.   I won't be guy in it again.
B00GDH4RTO|5|Well made and easy to work with. Installation is a breeze when using the right installation method. I highly suggest you visit the 1060graphics.com website to watch there installation video if you've never installed any type of stripes or graphics before. If you've ever installed stripes or large graphics before, this item will be very easy to install with the same methods and techniques.
B00T86ADZ4|4|The markings are very accurate, as I had to re-evaluate this product with my micrometer. Excellent value for the money!!!
B0040ZIVA2|5|Nice piece, I like it
B000C2CNMY|5|I wont put anything else on my jeep but fel pro. GREAT product
B005FKXJEY|5|I have 7k on these for my 2012 Ford Fusion.  Came with replacement pad hardware and rubber boots.  Break in instructions were comprehensive and the labeling of each rotor made it so even I couldn't screw it up!  Helps that the drilled rotors touch up the aesthetics of the wheels a touch as well
B004I8SF5M|1|Within one year the finish on the inside of the passenger side light peeled off and the lense started fogging up.
B00CZ4VFOE|4|I bought this to install in my new Neotec helmet. First issue is that the speaker/mic does not fit into the Neotec speaker pockets. I used hot air to soften the pockets and stretch them a bit to fit the speakers.  I paired the Uclears to a Zumo 660 and my LG phone. Using the phone was problematic. I could hear OK but folks on the other end had a hard time hearing/understanding me. Closed helmet was worse than an open helmet.  I ended buying the Uclear speakers with the remote mics. I mounted the mics behind the cheek pads at the front of the helmet. with this set up I have been able to make a call with the helmet closed and have the other end understand me fine, though they do hear noise. Helmet open is still better  The way I am set up is to link the Uclear to the GPS and the phone to the GPS rather than each one to the Uclear. Phone calls are answered or placed through the GPS and I also use the GPS to play MP3s.  Playing music, well, when things are connected properly, it sounds great. It is obvious when the audio is not right. I have notice two modes of bad operation. One is where the audio sounds tinny and is lacking a lot of frequency content. The second is where the audio seems to be playing back too fast then pauses every second or so to catch up. To solve the issue, I restart the GPS, then it usually connects the second time fine.  It;s not a perfect set up, I'm not sure if the audio link issues are the Uclear or the GPS. It is easy enough to work though and when it is working the results are very good.  I found what links 99% of the time for me. Turn on Make sure UClear is on first and fully powered on ( hear the turn on tone ) Then turn on Zumo 660 Wait for linked tone Two taps of power button to start playing  Turn off Stop music playing ( single tap on power button ) Power down UClear Power down Zumo  If I follow these steps, the music will play properly 99% of the time.
B00N9LMXUC|4|You get what you paid for so it is not the best but It meets the expectations in term of doing what it suppose to do.
B004C46IWO|5|I love them!!!!
B001FCPM1O|5|Love it
B001GH5ORK|5|Replace the factory hood latches on your Jeep Wrangler. Even with the lower air dam removed, the hood stays closed tight with no wobble. Takes a few minutes to install but worth every penny.
B000M5QPSY|5|The best stuff
B00HR26V1Q|5|Good quality, very bright, installed them about 20 min and looks awesome

B0017M8HPA|5|does more than expected nice piece
B001JYQ7QC|5|Great product!
B00NBN1C78|4|This is a good jack that does the job. We tried it out lifting a Ford Explorer, and it worked well and did the lift with no problem. Since it is a trailer jack, though, be careful using it with a car.<br />One slight problem. The jack has a tendency to slip around when you are cranking it up until it catches the weight which then anchors it in place.<br />This would be a handy jack to have along if you tow trailers or a boat.<br />Recommended.
B00J5ZL42O|1|I'm sure it is a great filter, but Amazon says it fits 2014 Mazda 3.  It does NOT fit.
B00OVW07TM|5|Worked just as expected. There is no question that the light inside is now much brighter. Would recommend.
B00NPQUYM0|5|I purchased four of these and installed them on the front bumper for fog lights. They work great. Purchased four more to mount on the headache rack for backup and cargo lights.<br />I have also purchased two of the 4&#34; square 3100 lumen lights from KAWELL and mounted them in the rear as backup lights. People know when I am backing up. And I can see!
B000BLNR9E|5|Great
B0013FSWQU|5|Acdelco quality. Good price. Exact fit for my vehicle. I would suggest purchasing these. Even if you don't own a gm vehicle.
B00QWBGZ8M|5|Not only did my boost peak 500 rpms sooner, but, my underhood temps are markedly lower! For those looking to eke out every last ounce of power out of their turbo car,this is it.
B006RA2JFG|5|great product came fast and will buy again,<br /><br />  thanks
B001P22OY2|5|Great when coupled to the CURT Anti-Rattle device, perfect for Jeeps with oversized spares to use with hitch mounted bike racks
B004GCDZKU|4|Very inexpensive.  Looks identical to the OE passenger side mirror.  Installed easily on my 2001 GT.  Works perfect.  I would have given this 5 stars, but at highway speeds the glass still &#34;flutters&#34; and vibrates some and that's the reason I was replacing the mirror to begin with!  The OE mirror glass was shaking and fluttering at highway speeds and I couldn't see what was coming up beside me.  So I decided to replace the entire mirror.  This new mirror is much better but there's still a little flutter in the glass.  My OE passenger side glass is rock solid up to 70 MPH or beyond.  So, 4 stars for this product.
B00GTGLXZK|5|Perfect fit and a very good price. Very satisfied.
B0094BL7F8|4|Great product. Fast ship

B0041RWKRO|5|Seems to lubricate just as well as normal chain oil.  I've used for several hours of sawing without any issues.
B012L5F95W|5|Works and looks great. Comes with four washer and bolts for the battery box and three for the front headlight bracket.
B00C5TBC60|5|work great
B000GD5FMY|5|Surprised by good quality for the low price. Fit great, great look. Clear glasses great for riding at night.
B0010E1M02|5|Works like it should.
B00KTHX0HY|1|I purchased the remote because pink is my favorite color and the price was reasonable, but the efficiency of the remotes are horrible. You can only program one remote at a time and you can not utilize your remotes until you are extremely close to the vehicle to get the remote to work. I wouldn't recommend them because the functioning is horrible.
B001P2HUWI|5|Perfect all around.Wife is very happy .Thanks,Scott Furrow.
B00YI3IGA6|4|This product serves my needs. I bought it to cover my driver's and back passenger windows on my Audi Q3 from the sun. I park my car in my driveway and the sun beats down on this side of my car. I would have given it a 5-star except the product doesn't cover the driver's door completely. I have to hold onto it and quickly shut the door so it stays in place. It fits fine over the back passenger door window. There is no way one could use these when driving if on the driver's window. I am happy with the product.
B00N6D7K38|1|didnt work at all

B00C9E29CM|5|This stand is a cinch to use with my Ducati 1098s. It picks the bike up easily and holds it stable. The rear axle nut is hard to take off on this bike, and I had to use a breaker bar, but the stand held true and didn't wobble. It's made of high-quality materials and will last forever as long as you use it only for the purpose for which it is intended. Value is well worth the money.
B003YLH8QQ|5|perfect
B006HJ2R18|3|This is fine if you bought it here but you need someone who knows what they are doing to install it, but it looks easy, wet the entire area place hood wrap on it position it and squeeze  out all of the water but it is great material
B00DWVN08I|5|As described, quick shipping.
B00196SK60|4|Didn't actually need it but it was exactly what I was looking for at a good price
B00ECWFDUO|5|fit perfectly used oem brackets did job in less 30 min. looks much better than old ones that were black.
B002PMOM5A|5|Great price on a 2012 VW Jetta TDI fuel filter<br />Fast shipping
B00P8IJSQ6|5|EXCELENT PRODUCT
B00ZTYNLN0|5|These work great and seem to be very good quality. Good price too for real rubber. Not like those cheap plastic ones you find in stores.
B000BNMOLY|5|EXCELENT PRODUCT
B0075VGTUW|3|Slim size makes it easy to had but the +/- wires are backwards from normal
B001J7O6SA|3|The headlights look good, but they are terrible to aim. The internal<br />Reflectors aren't centered correctly and they don't focus light on the road very well. I would save my money and get better ones
B00032K9R4|5|These frames look like jewelry for my new car with the added chrome bolt covers
B0081JCK6Y|5|just right
B00ASY28WG|5|Worked perfect and saved me $200+ over a dealer install on my 2013 Honda Pilot. The printed instructions are hard to follow, but you can find a video or two on Youtube that will help you understand what you need to do. A quick easy project. Hardest part is understanding how to unplug the existing wiring - some you push, some you pull.
B001EEUUBU|5|Excellent product! All i gotsta say!
B009XA8YK6|5|This little black beauty fits my Nissan Altima. Look great and the price is right.
B00QUHMWAS|5|Perfect fit lexus is 350 good quality material buying second pair for back seat nice.
B009MATEPG|5|This thing fits the Sprinter's big windshield perfectly, and keeps the vehicle much cooler than it was without it. Seems pretty dura ble through a few cycles of rolling up for storage and extending for use.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00AN5S3XS|5|Great set of rotors and pads for the cost, would recommend them to anyone wanting a much better braking system
B00FVTL5M2|4|OK, this IS a great helmet and my first full face helmet.  I've always used 3/4 helmets with a face shield but decided if I was going to wear a helmet, I might as well make it as safe as possible.  I also recently went from a bike with a full frame mounted fairing to a bike with no wind protection.  My 3/4 helmet buffeted horribly.  This hemet is light as a feather, DOT and Snell rated.  There is absolutely NO buffeting at 80 mph. Even when turning my head to change lanes there is no wind issue.  It's also very comfortable.  It IS however, as has been stated, quite noisy.  I don't personally have an issue with that.  I'm far more concerned with safety.  I was debating about a Shubert, but didn't care for the fit.
B00BSGN5L6|4|10 of the 12 survived the first year.  Let's hope they don't keep burning out....
B000R8F47Y|5|It does smell really bad, but is easy to use and not too bad to untangle when you take off the black hooks...easy to use and fits our toyota tundra truck bed nicely.
B00OU2N7EA|5|Fits awesome for a soft top. Was skeptical but I like it.
B007AMCKUY|3|Received new solenoid today.  It was missing the two 4mm studs seen in the picture protruding from the back that are used to fasten it to the starter.  I tried to remove my old ones and broke one off.  I went to a hardware store and bought a long 4mm bolt and made my own studs.  Maybe this one was an oversight, but it took more time to do the job.  Otherwise the solenoid works great and seem to be well made.
B000VLF8A0|3|The strap that came with this product, that is required to use it, was too long. We tried for everything to make it work except for tying knots in the strap to shorten it. It simply would not work. I'm keeping it because we found a way to work around it, but it was very frustrating.
B002Q1INDM|5|This is in the back of my vehicle that I drive for work everyday, filled with water & soda.  This completely got me away from an ice cooler, having to change that out everyday, & the freedom of knowing that every time I needed something to drink it was cold.  Worth every penny.
B000HUOFWW|5|Great product
B001AWK9D0|5|It fits and looks great into my xr400r
B00HXKQ3VK|3|After about 6 months of having fun, this thing decided it was going to leak.  Not just one but 3. The main one was the compressor itself.  The copper fittings were leaking and also around the pressure gauge.  It was fun and loud while it lasted. Now it's time to upgrade to a hornblaster product.  This was ok for the money, but didn't hold up.
B002D33QBW|3|😎
B003X16QRE|5|Does as advertised
B00009PGNS|5|I drive a non tinted hatch back which tests the tolerance to heat on any object I leave inside. With that said today I had my pre-cooled from the 120v adapter cooler inside the hatch back and turned if off from 8am to 11am. took a 1hr drive. to let it sit for another 4 hours unplugged in my hatchback inferno then powered it up for another 30 minutes on my drive home. It is 9pm now and it has been unplugged sense 5pm and my 6 bottles of water are still Ice cold.<br />The Cooler was in direct sunlight the entire day underneath the Rear hatch glass. The lid was not hot. other items in the trunk where untouchable to give you an idea of how hot my car is during the day.
B005AN2460|1|Listen to the others that say it looks like fancy duct tape. It really does look like fancy duct tape. It doesn't have that matte sheen that real brushed metal has. In direct sunlight it sparkles and really looks like plastic. Only buy this if you have seen it in person and still like it.
B00MB891EA|5|See review for GMB &#34;heavy duty&#34; 930-2260
B0024GQI9K|5|Love love love this helmet~ this helmet wasn't over the top colors like some of the helmets and the painting isn't everywhere on the helmet. Just subtle butterflies for a female rider with a great price, comfort and DOT approval. I bought a size small as the helmet needs to be snug.
B00UU1DPRY|1|This did not pick up the satellite signal well even in a large parking lot with wide open sky in all directions.  Packed it up and sent it back.
B0066XT0RE|5|Beautiful license plate, 10mm bolts, remove old one and slap on these new ones. Truly gives a different look to my car.
B009ZZZT02|5|Great deal. Great products.
B004AIPZZI|3|Will this fit my Saturn ion 2003?
B000BO71M0|5|wish this came in every color.
B00474N160|1|The melted in my car 1 month into using them<br />Cheap construction<br />Cheap quality<br />Not worth the price
B00LLJIJIY|5|I love it, can't wait to get another one for the front!
B000RG4382|5|Great for day and night use
B00X35L3IW|5|Buy extras if you change seats often. The slightest angle and you'll strip the threads.
B000TMX3X0|1|Extremely dissapointed with this roundel. First of all, it arrived 11 that's ELEVEN days late. Second, and more importantly it has been on my car for two days now and the white portions of the emblem are already noticeably yellowing. Not impressed with this product at all. You get what you pay for and I should have gone with genuine BMW parts! ***photo added to show roundel after only 3 days on my car***
B000BNOI8G|1|It was very inexpensive, and you get what you pay for. I would not recommend this product.
B001VXXUWK|5|Great price and worked exactly as expected.
B0072UGXSY|3|Good product so far easy plug and play with the right harness for my truck. Disappointing the threads strip out so easy when mounting the bracket to the control unit that's why 3 stars instead of 5.
B005ET4SJQ|5|Still have them on my truck today
B004A6OCPY|4|I have not installed it yet but looks perfect. Was delivered on time. All is well
B00EI37NYQ|5|Big boo fan so getting this was freakin amazing. (: fast shipping and awesome decal. Ty!

B002R0N7GU|5|Perfect Fit 1995 GMC 1500
B00OC90BR2|5|Love them!!! Perfect!
B000BZG4H2|5|Very nice. A lot better than the cheap ones I get from the auto parts store for the same price.
B003WSN7DO|5|A lot smaller than I expected but it's so cute!! I love it (:
B00EECM5FI|5|2006 bmw m3 work very well in my car & look cool
B000CIPU7S|1|Does not fit a 5 hole wheel set as promised
B0028JLFCI|5|Worked perfectly.
B0066SSEF8|3|Good quality but will not fit early 944 without making alterations to prevent the passenger side cooling fan from slicing the hose.
B000BM8RT8|5|Keep this in my off-road rig and it performs flawlessly. I air down to 15psi when on the trail and this little guy inflates my 285/75/r16 tires back to 42psi in about 5 mins a tire. Never had any issues with the exception of touching the burning hot motor once or twice.
B0027UO7PU|5|Fit perfect on 2014 Honda Rancher AT w/ irs.  No modifications required.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Arrived on time and is exactly what I expected
B007AAUTG8|4|Theres a slight lag in the video but could also just be where I mounted the camera on the car.
B003YBMDRU|5|Very heavy duty.
B00Y17ANXW|5|I love it! Super fast shipping... My bumper was delivered and installed less than 24 hours after I ordered it! It doesn't come with instructions, but if you removed the stock bumper, it is very easy to install this bumper with the same bolts. No modification needed; even the factory fog lights fit.
B00KH2X8W8|1|This Keyless replacement does not fit Mazda 3 2007. This was listed as it will work with this car. Before this item arrived I received an e-mail saying that this will not work in my car but the company sent it to me anyway. Right now I am waiting for my money back and how to send this replacement back, until today I have no answer of Discount Keyless, hope this information will help you to save your time and money.
B00FL998R6|4|It's a gasket set. It seals things. I would give it 5 stars but the box that everything comes in basically disintegrated and covered everything in fine fibers. Required thorough washing/rinsing, as this entire job is about cleaning mating surfaces and keeping contaminants to a minimum.
B000XSEBEK|4|I bought this item many year ago, will probably be buying again.  The reason for repurchase is due to more my fault.  While this item is GREAT for fine adjustment of the accelerator pedal, it is not for depressing brake pedals.  It is rather weak where it screws together. I was using it to check brake lights as well as accelerator pedal duty and every time it started getting weaker right where the two parts of the rod screw together and eventually broke.  So, only use it on accelerator pedals and you won't have any issues, but if you need a brake pedal depressor, get something dedicated for that.
B0049J6YMQ|1|Second one on our car in 3 yrs. first one had a hole in it after 2 yrs. Muffler rusted and fell off the car at 3 yrs.  Bought this cheap crap muffler the second time because we are selling the car. Came in a box with no packaging and was bent and dented. I put it on anyway after bending it back into  shape.. Didn't have time to send it back. Wouldn't have made a diff. If you plan on keeping your car buy a good product.
B004TRKBOK|3|Construction is light plastic and not very effective for it's intented use.
B008JPG2H8|5|same as OEM part and cheap!
B001UJGRRA|5|These seat covers fit nicely on my 1996 GMC Suburban. They are made of a heavy grade material. Installation was fairly simple, had a little struggle getting the arm rest covers on. The slots line up pretty well with the lower side buttons on the seat. Overall I am very pleased with these. Would recommend.
B000VAPVBM|5|Dropped right in.
B00852684M|1|They didn't shine bright at all. I was not impressed with these an would not recommend them.
B003SWNVL2|5|It was perfect for what we needed
B000KQK6XU|5|love these cute just wish people would not steal these
B00FOGHFZS|4|Great little key chain but it fell off the &#34;o&#34; ring shortly after getting it. Luckily found the animae character in my sons backpack.
B000CPJMY8|5|This stuff works great.  I use latex gloves and just grab a glob of it and use it where ever...garage door rails, my car lift legs, and smaller items like water hose gateway valve parts.
B00BDBWRJW|5|Went on very easy
B00Y1L2WJQ|1|Little Small for XL.
B00COB8T6K|5|I'm very happy with this item. I wanted something that would be relatively simple to add and remove as I went on trips, and this does the trick. Excellent value for the money.  Also, this item fits on my sissybar with room to spare over the lay back license plate.
B00BFU4ASC|5|it fit perfectly in our camper stove
B00MEFD9T8|5|I was very pleased with the quality also how fast i recived it .Great experieance.
B000QGZXCS|4|works good
B0041MTABS|4|Good quality, works fine
B0028JPECA|5|Great and compact and it works
B00XTTNPLK|4|Works great. Some other gas cap vents don't have a one way valve.  Update: I dropped my bike and the valve flew off. Found it right away but you need to make sure you zip tie the tube onto the valve. Now that I did that, I don't worry about it flying off.
B00065JM8U|4|Great little fan.  I had been searching for a fan to install into my solar setup to blow air around my shed/cabana.  I purchased a few other models and was disappointed.  Poor construction and manufacturing.  This one however feels very solid and moves a surprising amount of air for a 6&#34; fan.  Love the all metal construction and rubber gasket for mounting.  It is somewhat loud on it's high setting.  Limited range of adjustment.  Will likely buy another down the line.
B005N6ZF0Q|3|DIDN'T WEAR WELL
B003S1RQ2S|5|Got this for my daughters electric car. :) works great and super easy install
B00SZ5A5B6|5|Back on the road and saved a bundle, THANKS!!!
B000KL74P8|5|Does the job very well.  Fitment is almost perfect, cant complain!  Purchased used through Amazon Warehouse, the mats looks brand new.
B00BCRMC1U|1|The Material was not as expected!!!
B00DM9ZIDK|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B000T9TLZM|5|I've been using Redline synthetic oil for more than 35 years.  I first noticed a box of it sitting in a BMW dealer's Service Manager's office.  I researched it and have been using it ever since.  I was able to put 185K aggressively driven miles on my 1985 BMW 535i and never had to do anything more than tune-ups and regular maintenance.  The engine in the 535 was known to wear in the area of the camshaft rocker arms which would ultimately become quite noisy at idle.  This never occurred with my car which I attribute to Redline oil's outstanding lubrication on engine startup.  I sold the car to my brother and he continued driving it and using Redline oil for close to 300K miles.  After that experience and more similar  that followed I have become a believer in Redline products.  There are a number of quality oil products out there but if you wish to trust your pride and joy to one of the finest (same base base stock used in modern jet engines) you will not be disappointed.
B0081WNKPQ|5|very good exellent
B008I2MPSM|5|Works great
B00LMP3XKQ|5|It's huge! It does move the rear view mirror but that's not a huge problem. This shade was worth every penny. I have leather seats in my Fit and it hasn't been unbearable with this shade.
B000ET525K|4|Looks good.  I keep it with me.  Haven't had opportunity (or misfortune) to use it
B004C6TYGO|5|This is a very great hitch. I installed it on my 2013 Kia Sportage and it went on very easily. I was able to install it by myself with little trouble. It only took me about 20 minutes from unpacking it to fully installed. I would recommend using two people just for the fact that it is a little heavy and awkward to hold up while using a ratchet.  If I had one other person with me I might have been able to finish in about 10 minutes. Very good product and easy to install.
B00KC39BE6|4|worked fine
B00ANZHG7C|5|Microfiber, use them.
B009NLMWT4|5|Exactly like the switch that comes with the light kits.  I bought this one because I added some back up lights on my Polaris 800 RZRs and didn't want to wire the switch to my reverse switch, instead I wanted to have manual control over them.  Drop in replacement and looks exactly like the switches for my Rigid Dualls and my 28&#34; light bar.
B005L8F09M|1|Does not work with bmw 325i 2003 makes my car go haywiree
B0117AYGV0|5|right item fit perfect led.
B00DD98SAY|5|works just fine
B00HS1HOFI|5|I have the 96 Chevy Tahoe LT. Part came on time, popped right in. Works beautifully.
B00CFPRN9E|2|Cheaply made and sizing is off and seems inconsistant
B00ONDM07G|5|Worked perfectly on my '13 Sahara.  Easy 10 minute install and looks OEM.
B0050EH4EG|5|Works great.
B00OPSO4MI|1|came much sooner than expected but I can't use it. this light has 6 wires on it all marked differently I finally figured what each one did. through trial and error since there is no wiring diagram. the issue comes when you have a car that uses the same light for brake and blinker and emergency flasher. this light has a wire for right flasher, left flasher. emergency flasher, brake light, and running lights the last one is ground. so if you have you blinker on and apply the brake the flasher stops and only the break light is on. at night when the running lights are on that turns on all of the LEDs and nothing else works very disapointed
B0063U45K2|5|This worked great. My other had cracked so saw this and ordered it right away. Perfect fit on my 03 Jetta
B00F676B0U|3|Poor design by GM. Breaks too easily. Why the rubber stopper that keeps it from traveling further than 1&#34; off the window is beyond me. Impossible to clean below it with a squeegee. As for the vendor, no complaints at all. When this one breaks, I'll come right back here to buy another one!
B00I5058AY|5|Easy to install, no issues. Total time to install was an hour. Definitely recommend alignment after install just like any other lift.
B008YFU3F0|5|This kit is the best. Great price, all components work well and the slim design is a space saver for a tight fit under the hood. If for some reason u have trouble with install or an issue with a component, the company is more than willing to help troubleshoot the issue. They stand behind their product as well. If u can't get the product working after troubleshooting it, they send out a replacement piece with no hassle. Great company!!!
B000C5WCPY|5|Downstream O2 sensor for my 97 Accord which fit perfectly.
B0015DMJ2S|5|very good price for a good tool
B00IT8UJ4W|1|I gave it away to a friend bc it is not like the one shown in the picture!!!! I disliked it . I thought ut would be the hat an beard instead it was a bald walter white decal.
B00P27AIR6|1|After only 7 months the passenger side bottom halo is out..  Now the Whole thing 11 months later is completly out...  So I would advise against these..
B00700E8QA|5|Worked and looks great
B002JFQFNA|4|Great sun glasses for very affordable price.
B00FMIP40G|5|Fits awsome ...makes room to clear ANYTHING !
B00B1VV7V8|5|It was just what I was looking for.
B00CP6K0CA|5|Looks good and fits well
B00LHTJFQ8|2|This fits my Q5 key very well, the buttons line up and it looks nice but it is ABSOLUTELY NOT REAL LEATHER, as the description states. Fake leather. Also, it arrived quickly, which was surprising since I'm pretty sure it came from HK.
B00PJ8WKWO|5|Sticks very well and looks fabulous! LIOB 💕💕
B00SZ70TP6|5|When I placed the order I was afraid the running boards wouldn't fit right or would be cheap looking.  However, when they arrived I was extremely satisfied with the quality.  They are very sturdy and durable.  They were pretty easy to install too, which was another plus for this item.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
B00E9CZLF4|1|This decal is junk! It came bent and the quality sucks. Don't waste your money!!!!
B00T9AGBOQ|5|This hting is magic! My 2014 Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid was dead out of electricity (ironic, I know). It'd sat outside unused for three weeks, and the 12V battery that apparently runs the electronics was dead. Fun fact: when that battery is dead, you can't even charge the other battery.  Or open the trunk, or unlock the back doors, or...you get the picture.<br /><br />This battery arrived 3/4 charged. I attached it to the power points in the car, and the thing started right up.  No worries, no AAA, no stress.<br /><br />It lives now (in the handy case it comes in) inside my car ready for future use. But not in the trunk, oh no, because once bitten twice not keeping anything in the trunk that I can't bloody open without power!
B00HXC6MNW|5|wonderfull product
B009RC2HVC|5|fit perfect
B009DJK0MW|5|Installed easily, however, it did not solve the problem. I then purchased a fan speed control and that solved my problem.
B00U36K3SA|1|didnt fit my truck and there was rust inside but got a refund and didnt have to send it back
B000WJYWG2|5|Everything worked out just fine…
B00594OIWS|5|Exelent
B004AH6NT6|3|Could not use them ,they were the mini and I needed the regular size...
B0033YJPNI|4|Fits well enough except by switch direction is reversed.
B000CCFFXS|1|Arrived damaged!!!
B004SHDK08|5|Put this on a 2004 Cadillac Escalade due to the fuel gauge not working. After replacement it works like a champ very easy to install as well.
B00GBSG9E6|2|Not nearly as long or wide as I imagined.  I only use it for the smallest of my brushes.
B007ZLKY1C|5|PERFECT MATCH
B006T8L2KY|5|I should have bought one ages ago! I work on a bunch of Vw/Audi cars and this really works well for filling the oil.
B000CKBO08|5|Professional safe brakes. Braking safely very important when transporting grandchildren!
B001SL9LL4|5|My girl love it
B003SZVQ1Q|5|Driver Side Marker Light Housing. Fit perfectly, OEM developed a leak, cheaper and easier than fixing the leak.
B0068FUSZI|5|It worked out really well easy to install and helped with the throttle response and fuel mileage
B00EW0E3OS|3|The covers look pretty good but the material is pretty flimsy. They don't have a very good fit either.
B007O5GWNI|5|Excellent unit been towing for 35 years it's the best unit I have used excellent response, love the options for different trailer sizes.
B00CNUIO4O|5|I ordered this for a 1984 Wheel Horse, Workhorse GT-1600.  Delivered on time, installed in two minutes and works perfectly
B00JDPR8GC|5|Good quality!
B0016HU7G8|5|Great product. Easy install.  Makes the truck look sexy.  Many compliments from the ladies
B00496VH62|3|Pump doesnt display fuel level accurate when i am less then a 1/4 tank it says im on empty. I have also had seal issue and it didnt come with any hose seals for gas lines.2001 chevy s10 4.3l ls.
B00Q3WWM8C|1|No good. Very loud., doenst blow air., very bad.
B00GNHP7B6|5|It has a nice weight to it. Doesn't feel cheap. It was a nice addition to my car keys.

Truck was never lacking power in any gear or inclines and rolled at 75-80 in 6th gear but this added over 100 plus HP and torque is nice and noticeable and mpg up about 2-3. 19-21 if I keep it at 65 mph which is rare. Normally roll 75-80 to river no towing and it's sweet. 17-18😜. CHP freeway flyer with with radar detector on Hwy setting and stealth mode. If they come I hide off in the deep desert😎🚔
B0023VIXNA|5|Exactly what I wanted at a fair price
B005MZYNGK|5|God
B000BRFSU4|5|We got these for our 2014 Casita camper.  Product was as advertised and installed in seconds.  The amber lens helps keep the bugs away when you're camping.  Thought they were a little pricey at first but when they arrived you can see they are thick and sturdy.  Should last years.
B00OUE4LZM|5|Great value!
B001PLDV40|5|Nice fit, well worth the cost
B00K1C1WC2|5|working great for my camper trailer.
B00XXLZ5T4|5|wonderful.  work great, just what i needed at a great price
B00AMPJ7DE|5|These worked perfectly. Easy to mount and the price was right, specially considering you'll pay a minimum of one hour of labor at a dealership or car repair shop, and I took the old ones out and had these installed inside of five minutes.
B00H2VVQNU|4|I'll give it a 5 star if it lives up to its reputation.  This product is spendy, and not as easy to work with as its name implies, quite a process.
B001AWLTX4|5|OK it all!
B000UEWSII|5|Great Product.
B00842A7F4|1|Do not buy for 2003 Lexus ES300 since it does not fit on any.  I bought this for Lexus ES300 since it mentioned but this does not fit to any.
B001DZ2OKA|5|Great looking and stays in place without problems
B00J0YNHY8|5|Smells so good!!
B0012X4AXW|5|Very easy to install. Monroe struts are quality.
B0086X6SRC|1|junk zipper broke
B00IAQ4HMS|5|perfect
B001XW7UWA|5|perfect
B002R0DM7O|3|I got this after my wife backed into our garbage can and completely annihilated her original. It was delivered on time and even came with bulbs. It doesn't fit quite perfectly as the mounting holes position it slightly lower than the original. It's not something someone passing by will notice unless they are looking for it but either way it's not a perfect replacement. But I guess for the price I paid for a replacement on a 2001 odyssey I can't be upset.
B002HLP9P6|5|Nice
B00CZBQCR2|4|They were fairly easy to put in and worked fine. The price was great.
B004X5R1Y6|5|Fast shipping and quality parts. Very happy with my order
B00J460ONY|4|Seam to do the trick for the touch up. Good instructions and packaed well.
B00X4C2SZQ|4|Good product and fast delivery.
B0060YI0YS|5|Worked perfect
B00G6I0TBU|1|The fronts fit perfectly, the rears do not fit. Why do you advertise they will fit my 2005 Honda Civic LX 4 door sedan??????? Now I have to go thru the hassle to send these back and buy a set of splash guards that fit from another vendor.
B00C8E0SZS|5|Great looking helmet and good fit for my little girl
B002QOYS42|5|As expected
B005HF2E2K|5|Easy to apply
B000CIT2YK|5|Nice sound. Near stock no too loud. Pipes are 3&#34; so more flow less restriction. Took longer to remove rusted muffler/pipe from catalytic converter. Enough clamps to make all connections. Keep your rubber exhaust hangers. I painted with Rustoleum High Heat 2000 deg paint and baked on the vehicle after install using Rustoleum's baking instructions. This way the rust will be prolonged or non existent for the next 100,000 + mi.<br />Recommended tools for extraction, grinder, jack, heavy mallet, jack stands (optional) so the muffler doesn't fall on you. For extraction I cut a vertical line in the old pipe( parallel to driver side door) that connects to catalytic converter (while supported by jack stands) then wiggled and pounded. Do not cut all the way through!!!!
B00192JFD6|5|This item works very well.  I had to remove a wasp nest before I installed it, but haven't had any problems since I put it on my camper.  I'm glad I found this item  It is literally a life saver as I am allergic to bee, wasp, and hornet stings.
B00SGCQBBQ|5|Brighter than the double row bars. A+ all around!
B000W0RQ8C|5|great and easy to use
B00HXY1370|3|You really have to make it work. You are getting what you pay for. Thats why i gave it 3 stars. It solves the purpose. I had to widen up couple slots to make it fit. One of them still can't get the bolt through. If you are hands on person, you will be fine. Otherwise don't get this.
B004F8U7SS|5|awesome, great tool
B000C39C6I|5|Workes like it is supposed to.
B00EUZZK5G|1|The cover does not sit securely on the truck bed. It flips up at the tailgate with a gap I can stick my hand in. I have tried to make it tighter but when I torque up the latches it will not latch. I will probably sell this one on Ebay and buy a better cover from my local accessory shop. Very disappointed.
B000C9XYQG|4|Works on my MG midget, but could actually be a bit longer. Screwed into motor first, as screwing into filter first made it too short to make contact with the block. Much cheaper, and loads less bulky than the filter adapter that was on the car. Easily use modern spin-on filter, and if it gets &#34;stuck&#34; in the filter, handy slot to help remove it.
B00656SMNK|4|not sure if I needed one of theses but decided since I am there might as well change it. no problems
B011LVLJTW|5|Awesome
B003FG4SKE|2|too blue and hard to see road
B0073M53VE|5|A+
B001V3959W|1|i was looking forward to these sunglasses since my brother has the same pair - But they arrived defected, when i placed them on my face, they fit completely crooked / twisted. I had a couple friends try them on and asked them to give me their first impression - both their answers were &#34;they are crooked&#34;.... so im sending them back.
B000AMXSYI|3|The screw top to bleed the air was nearly impossible to turn.
B00861C6LQ|5|I have had it in for only a week but I defiantly have noticed an increase in mpg, throttle response and in power. MPG: 40-41 if I baby it, 33-35 if I get on it a lot.  The the sound and performance gains defiantly add to the fun of driving.  The power gain was more then I expected, I figured people's reviews may have been a little exagerated.  The sound is defiantly noticeable.  Easy to install, just give yourself at least three hours, I spent a lot of time removing old fittings that didn't want to come lose, use the YouTube video. Wife summed it up rather well without knowing what it did.. &#34;Is it supposed to sound like that?&#34; 10 minutes later &#34;That thing added some power huh?&#34;
B004HMBK5G|4|Works like a charm.
B000RZR2W2|2|Wasn't that impressed.  Left alot of water spots on our rv.  Wiped it all down by hand still not impressed.  Will not buy again.
B00I0JNH94|1|was not like advertised and i had to peel off every letter individually. was suppose to come off backing and wouldnt i am not happy with this purchase at all!!!
B0073X2NPM|5|Looks much better than cheap-looking original antenna; performance seems as good as original.
B00I5054M6|3|My 2013 F150 lariat is leveled now with the 2.5 but if you put any kind of weight in the back it will sit lower than the front. also well you lift the truck off the ground the upper control are hits the strut. as of now im not sure if its a big deal. Installation was far from easy. but with a lot of man power I was able to get the struts out. other than that make sure you thread lock everything. Did the job. Going for 35 inch tires.
B0009VIPYI|4|Nice item for detail
B00B9F1THI|5|Install was easy!
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Great product.  Light to carry.
B000BVRZ74|5|As advertised, works pretty well!
B00L2LTP7K|5|Look great
B00U38YD16|5|Great pruduct, item was delivered before it was expected.  Easy to install and looks great on my jeep.
B00MYWXM0M|3|They were not the actual size and had to return but the design does look as the picture
B000CO826S|5|Took an hour to install.  Only had to drill one bracket to fit a bold. Overall sound is clearly louder at 3.5K RPM and higher.
B00W8H4KH2|5|[[VIDEOID:74eed25122b619d80ac5721cf0ad7557]] The Good:<br /><br />* 15,000 mAh, 500 amp Peak- plenty of juice to jumpstart a car, truck, boat, motorcycle, ATV, etc.<br />* Very nice leather case to hold everything<br />* Blue LED light indicator for battery status - each dot is 20%<br />* Air compressor included<br />* Multiple accessories included to power most notebooks, and smart phones<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />* It really does make sense to have one of these in your automobile or really anywhere that you are dependent on the battery<br />* You use the air compressor and the 12 V connection wire included to run power from the Viper battery<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />I am a huge fan of brightech's products and the Viper is just another feather in the cap. I definitely recommend this for anyone that is looking to have an emergency kit wherever they are dependent on a battery. It really could be a lifesaver. Please note that I was able to test this product at a discount in order to provide you with an honest, unbiased review.
B00ALGA0DK|5|😃
B007EEVKS6|5|Excellent!!!!!!!'
B002FDGQGM|4|One of the best sounding, looking, performing slip on exhausts on the market.<br />On a secondary note, the decibel level is very high, so if you are on long rides and have sensitive ears, or want to hear whats coming through your headphone or bluetooth, beware.
B000C33LLA|5|Worked great
B001447VB2|5|Amazing stuff.  I used it on stainless steel and on weathered headlights.  Worked awesome on both
B0039LDF4A|5|Had a leaking seal on the right fork; 2013 Gladius, with 2700 miles. Works as stated. It's like a thin plastic book mark. Have one for home and one on your bike tool kits. A little fluid will leak, while you use it, but don't worry.
B00JP479RO|5|Works fantastic.  No issues at all.  Inserted all of the electronics from the original key and took to the honda dealer and they cut the key for free!  They were very impressed at the dealership,  they never saw a flip key for a ridgeline!  No complaints at all!
B00IIWJL8Y|5|Great product fits perfectly
B0015PK3AG|5|One is supposed to tigh the housing with the hand or a wrench if you are a woman but in case one stupid person overtorque the housing no following directions from manufacturer company but his own then do not go anymore to that place. Buy this tool take your time and do it yourself. It is your car please take care of it. Maybe you will have to buy another filter house but that will be the last one because you will not overtight the housing. Why not? because it is your car.
B000C83RUK|5|Part fit perfect and did what it was supposed to do.<br />Was lucky to find this on Amazon.
B00EZ85W7O|5|Perfect fit! Looks great! Good strong adhesive included.
B00WH1ZC80|4|These seem fine. I just put them on my headrest and I have to say that my only problem with them is that the hooks are not wide enough to really hold a purse with wide straps without potentially damaging the straps. It will hold grocery bags and bags with slim straps just fine but I wish they would also hold wider strapped bags as well.
B0048G7GFE|5|Fits well and stays in place even without the velcro/stick'em strips that are included.  Takes almost the full two weeks for it to arrive, so plan ahead.
B003SZLWD8|5|Working great
B00BD75JXC|5|Fits on my 08 Kawasaki Vulcan 900.
B0002NYB78|3|Even though these are made from plastic, they work fine. But for just a few dollars more, you could have the all-metal OTC equivalent, which is rather better and will surely last longer.
B004FO5P1Q|5|These straps work great. I have a set already, for over a year and decided to buy more.  Love them.
B003IQSMCG|5|This works perfectly with my Garmin Oregon 650 GPS.  It holds securely and I am comfortable that it won't fall out when I use it on my kayak or canoe.  Of course I also secure it with a backup attachment cord just to make sure but it has shown no signs of letting my unit fall out.  It gives a satisfying snap when the unit is placed inside.  It is well made and sturdy as are all of the Ram Mounts.  I'll have to say I think it is very dependable if I would risk my expensive equipment on it's reliability.  I recommend it highly.
B00W97S08Q|3|Wired this light up in my RV and would not turn off, went to the ITC-US web site and shows two different lights, one touch switch and one without. The light gives off just enough light, guess I will look for a switch.
B00MB8A072|5|This GMB fan clutch is described for &#34;heavy duty&#34; applications. There is also a GMB fan clutch(930-2050) for &#34;extra heavy duty&#34; applications. I contacted the GMB rep for the best choice for my needs here in hot Alabama(continuous A/C operation) and towing a 3500# boat with 1500 Suburban. He suggested under those circumstances to go with the &#34;Extra heavy Duty.&#34; Also, the clutch should be changed at around 100k miles for optimum engine cooling performance. Not an expensive purchase and easy to change out. Fan noise is louder and longer with the extra heavy duty clutch.
B0049YKNQY|5|Worked as advertised
B009LREACM|5|Good adhesive!  I used it on an EPP wing and it is strong and not brittle.
B00OTE4FLI|5|I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend and he LOVES it!!!
B00GLJYLKO|4|These seem more like 6500 or 7000.  Definitely a lot of blue &#34;effect&#34; to the lighting.  Seem fine besides that, but only time will tell.  I sure don't want to have to change these out too soon on 2015 Toyota Tundra - Possibly the most complicated and difficult headlight bulbs to change out on the planet... Probably easier to remove entire headlight housing to replace instead of following Toyota manual instructions.
B008M7IIIY|5|Awesome
B000WKKC1K|2|Radio works great. (Add said it comes with wiring. ) Not true. Had to cut off plug and wire it my self.
B0010E00T6|4|Uhhh it seems fine and a lot cheaper than having Honda dealer do it
B00030DLEE|4|I'm a truck driver and after 4 years it was time to get another one. I can bake a potatoe, frozen pizza and just about anything. But now I have made a change and eat only healthy meals my wife and kids prepare at home. You can use the tin trays that are available, but I get the cheap zip loc type plastic containers at our local grocery store. Pack my meals and heat them up and reuse the containers.<br />A little advice, I will put a couple of sheets of paper towels on the bottom and pour a little water just to get it a little soaked, not too much that it drips if it turns over. This way the warmer will not melt plastic containers and it also works as a steamer. When you get ready to take your food out just be careful when you open lid as it will let out steam vapors. Gets my food piping hot in about 20 minutes,
B0011D6NF6|4|I bought this many (6?) years ago from Walmart.  The black paint came off after a year.  The frame began to discolor (grey/white spots) from road salt (Illinois) after two years. I still have them on my car but overall, they are now silver. I love the design so much, I've sanded, primed, and resprayed the plates though repainting the inside is tricky at best (I'm not good at masking apparently).  Seeing this for $8, I'll be rebuying.  I will put additional exterior grade clear coat on before placing on the vehicle.
B00AHJZBCG|5|Extremely bright light with tight pattern out to 300 yards. Lots of bang for your buck.
B00JVUFDOS|5|put on my 2008 Silverado and they work great, low profile so it sits close to the window and looks much better in my opinion then those ones that are high up.
B001J8Q5VA|5|Installed on 2011 DL650 VStrom.  Had to extend the front hydraulic brake line due to the lift.  Easy to install.<br />There is infinite adjustability at the bottom and top mount points and since it's one piece, no need to worry about left-right alignment.
B001DCEX6G|5|My local Honda dealer installed for free while working on a couple other things.  They didn't gripe about this brand and for $16 bucks much cheaper than $50-$75 to just have the dealer or shop order it and install.  Also so easy to install anyone can do it.  Unscrew one bolt, remove old part, insert new part, tighten bolt.  Only reason I had dealer do it was because the car was already going in for other stuff.
B00A71IJTG|5|Beautiful!  Heavy and high quality.  Locking cap nut is not required.
B00UL3EXD6|5|I love to drive scooters but had a 150cc scooter for a few years. The scooter was not working efficiently and I was worried as what might be wrong with it. I took it to a mechanic and he asked me to buy a Engine Rebuild Kit. I bought this product from GOOFIT and now my scooter works perfectly without a problem.
B0009IQZFM|5|This thing is great. Absorbs all the water and does it without leaving any streaks
B002PQW6NG|5|easy to change and look awesome ... give a better look to my volvo look like a new car and price is perfect
B000182EUU|5|Works perfect looks good. Speedy arrival. Thank you.
B00CD2RBS2|3|Thin plastic and kinda bulky but should cover the rust on my fenders.
B0050QJOCY|4|Loved it. Was worried about butterfly  floor may but they are pretty. Love that it's not thread or material makes clean up easy. Single butterfly on steering wheel cover. Now all I need are more stickers!!!!
B004QHJI3S|5|Super fast shipping. Item was as described and so far it works perfectly!
B000CPCAMO|3|Not what i needed
B0000AXRH5|3|Smaller funnel than you think you're buying, but still pretty useable. If your hands shake while pouring something, better find a wider mouth funnel....
B00RW7WNF4|5|After browsing Amazon for a good set of wipers at an affordable price for my Accord I stumbled across these and began to question the quality of these wipers given their set of two, and their cost. To my surprise, they work flawlessly! They fit my vehicle perfectly and wipe away water on my windsheld with ease. These were such an improvement to the OEM wipers I had on since day one. Definitely a great pair of wipers and will plan on re-buying once that time comes again.
B000COOLRM|5|good quality and easy to use thanks  will buy again
B000MS5T4W|5|once you buy and use these,you will wonder why you didn't get them sooner
B007OW66PK|5|about a quarter of the price the dealer wanted to charge me.
B00GTXO3LE|5|Genuine OEM part, in the MBZ packaging. Why pay dealership prices?  Easy to swap out- change your own filters in 10 minutes or less.
B00SLKR3S8|3|Did not come with new O-Rings, after all my hard work putting this in I had to pay 50 bucks labor for the shop to put the O rings in,..
B00RV83UUG|5|Perfect, I love it!
B00EPQUH3A|5|very good fit, easy to put on and take off, durable.
B003VASDRS|5|Looks to be good quality
B00JRHI0W2|5|Best purchase I have ever made for our camper. My hips would hurt so bad (especially in the winter) after even one nights sleep. My husband and I slept like babies. Didn't feel each other roll over. There's no smell after it airs out. Perfect!!
B000K8TFLM|5|Find your car... it will stand out if you put this on your antenna... and they are just soooo fun!
B0012Q9ZSO|5|Perfect for tune up of 2000 Lexus SC.
B000IMG6O4|1|Won't fit standard multi meter leads
B00CASDZKC|4|Quality, straight-forward product. My Audi A4 didn't have any location to attach the bottom, longer strap without wrapping around the entire seat. I added a couple of small black bungee cords to the seat springs and it works as designed.
B000GU3ESE|5|excellent
B00K24P464|5|Item received as described, thanks.
B001LVA2H8|5|Went right on and working great
B00VRARG2M|5|Very happy, these lights fit in bumper of 88-91 honda CRX perfectly. Shipping quick, honest seller. Very good price & product. 👍👍👍💯%😸
B00CQ7XD5O|3|good product but very poor xena customer service. takes ages to get a reply
B0009IQTC6|5|Good deal at a good price
B00E3M82XI|4|I like it, but there is a distinct scent. It almost doesn't smell fresh[[ASIN:B00E3M82XI Mann Filter (CUK 29 005) Carbon Activated Cabin Air Filter]]
B004XH7RKM|5|This product saved me a lot of time figuring how to hook up my trailer lights and is working great
B001N729FS|2|works ok
B00XXLZ5T4|5|I've been using these towels every day.  Great product!
B00RBW43MG|5|Great!
