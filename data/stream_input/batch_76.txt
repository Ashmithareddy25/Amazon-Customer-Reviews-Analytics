B00505DVBU|5|I received so many compliments on my shirt and even have a friend who wants to borrow it for next year. Shirt is somewhat fitted but otherwise is perfect!!!
B0018O8OSC|4|it'sv what i wanted
B00FDLRDCY|1|already falling apart after one use, not worth the money. all the material is crappy. it does not look the way it does in real life.
B00518O6OM|4|I bought these for my girlfriend in size 7 and she loved them...they do run a little bit big but other than that they're great!
B00C3C1DXQ|5|I used to have a lot of different duffle bags including the Herschel bag, which I loved.  But unfortunately the buckle parts were made out of plastic, so they broke really easily, and my zipper also broke within the same year.  This bag is awesome though, I wanted something I could take to work without looking like a gym bag, and this bag looks pretty good.  It's on a smaller size, which I actually love because it fits perfectly into a locker without having to put it in at a slanted angle.  Also the buckles are all made out of metal so I doubt that it will break easily.  It is made in China so I had my doubts but so far it is holding up really well!  The pockets are also great, there are two outer button pockets on the sides of the bag, and three inner pockets of different sizes, and one inner pocket with a zipper.  It is also large enough for a weekend bag if you are a guy.
B001B6N6SK|4|The top is big, like other reviewers noted, but my hips are rather voluptuous and a Medium fits just fine. (Size 6/8 hips, 4 top). I was happily surprised that I could wear this costume. Other reviewers are right, though-- the quality is really cheap. But what do you expect for a cheap costume? Works well enough for me!
B008EKSZFK|4|Got this outfit for my little niece. The leggins are adorable, I wish I were able to find them in my size!!!
B00NPJJ04U|5|WoW!! Great item for the price!!  I bought this for a Valentine's Day gift for my wife and she looked soooo amazing.  People that have reviewed this product complained about how sheer this product is and I think that's the beauty of it.  My wife was gorgeous in this and I will buy it in red next!  Product fit and quality were great too!!
B00IW3KEEE|5|Super cute.  Love it
B000BK4EII|5|I would recommend ordering a size up for this bra. This is seriously the best sticky bra I have ever worn. I never had to pull it up or adjust it...it stays put all day! I will definitely be purchasing more of these.
B00GZH6KH4|5|Exactly as described and the fit is wonderful.<br />I love the colors and the chin strap keeps it from blowing off in wind.<br />Many compliments and is an accessory hat to all garments.
B005XL40YI|5|I bought the purple and white. My niece actually chose it herself, shes a size 4 getting into a size 5 so i bought the 5. Its a bit big as i expected but she looks fantastic. It has a very classy look. I love it.
B003Z4TOY6|5|Bought it for my wife and she loved it.  It is a bit small, but definitely just as sexy as you would imagine it to be!
B00PVL2CFE|5|This item is actually EXACTLY like the picture, really looks and feels real.  Perfect fit and color.
B00CH5TXKY|4|I'm a big guy and this bathrobe is great I love it ,the only problem I found was it does shed a little overall its a great buy
B00KBJPE60|5|Bought these for my father in law.  The fabric is a little on the thin side, but this is comparing them to the JCPenney brand Stafford which is very thick but far too expensive for his budget.  He has not complained about the fit, and believe me, he has no problem complaining.  Very good buy.
B00NSAV9H2|5|Perfect for having a sexy lookin booty at the beach
B00NU2RF7Q|5|Great, comfy and looks awesome on my son, he loves those. Delivery was prompt.
B009Z7FDFG|5|Love this slip, built in bra is great. Not too tight. Love not having to wear a bra with a slip over it.
B001OOP9CK|3|I love the looks of the hat, but it does run small.  After wearing it for an hour, I started to get a headache.  It also left a mark on my forehead.
B0049C54RE|2|Cap was nice but to small
B00OBZAXNE|1|Firstly I didn't realize they were basically leggings. But the ridges and zipper definitely add all the character. Unfortunately when I pulled them up I tore a whole right through them!!! I am a size 2 so I'm not trying to fit in something that doesn't fit. Can't believe it and hope I can get a replacement as I do like them otherwise.
B00LBH3O4K|1|was very disappointed in the gloves...very hard to get on, and my 3 yr old was upset because he could not get his hands into the gloves with the strap fully pulled out, it still was constricted. Sorry I bought and received them.  I had to go out and try to find another pair of out door goves.  I found some finally at Bass Pro Shop.
B00KBADRVS|5|Fits perfect no complaints
B000OE624A|4|This tie is a little wide at the bottom, but for the price it is a nice basic black tie. I ordered it for my husband to wear to a wedding and it will work fine!
B00LF3CPVI|5|My friend loved how it fit!
B00F4O2G7M|4|These pajamas are soft, warm and cuddly.  :)  I ordered the blue checked version and the red bows version and both are very pretty.  They are good quality with reinforced stitching along all of the seams.  The pull-over top style helps keep you warmer than pajamas with button-down tops (which make it easier for your body heat to escape into the room).  I was chilly this evening, but warmed up right away when I put on these pajamas.  Now I can sit at the computer without shivering.
B00PR74RSM|5|My niece loved it!
B00CKIH3SM|5|They stay on his feet, and that is what I was looking for. Good quality and cute too. Very happy.
B00AEF2N4C|5|I really love this product. It was wrapped appropreitly and was worth my money. I would recommend this product to others.
B000F9WJ7S|5|If you are used to Levi's, here's some help in choosing a Wrangler jean that will fit you properly.  This jean is the classic \\"Cowboy Cut\\" that Wrangler has been making since 1947.  Among the Levi's jeans, the fit of this jeans is most similar to that of the Levi's 505, which in turn is similar to the Levi's 501, meaning that it is a fairly standard fit, not too tight nor too baggy.  It doesn't have as much orange stitching as a Levi's, the back pockets sit higher, and the rise is a bit longer, giving it a slight dress pants look.  Unlike the Levi's 501, it has a zipper fly (like the 505) rather than a button fly.  The so-called \\"rigid denim\\" looks a lot like the \\"shrink to fit\\" rigid denim of the 501 when new and will lose a lot of indigo dye on the first wash, but that's where the resemblance ends.  The 501 shrinks about 10%, but the Wrangler Cowboy Cut shrinks less than 3%, because it is Sanforized.  So, you should err on the side of slightly larger if you are right on the border.  The the really neat thing about the Wrangler is that they still have copper rivets on the back pockets, something Levi's stop doing generations ago when schools complained that the rivets scratched the wood desk chairs the school kids used to sit in!<br /><br />Note also, that the Wrangler Cowboy Cut \\"Slim Fit\\" is quite a bit skimpier than this jean.  The slim fit seat is smaller and the legs are pretty trim--it's more of a boy's cut.  If you are really on the thin side, it may work for you, but many men will find it too constricting in the waist and seat.<br /><br />Wranglers stonewash finishes are pretty mainstream compared to some of the more exotic things Levi's is doing now.  These definitely are not so-called \\"destructed\\" jeans.  You won't find whiskering or abrasion the way you will on the stonewash Levi's.<br /><br />Overall, these are very solid well-made jeans that offer a nice alternative to the more popular Levi's models.  Like Levi's, they are well made and indestructible.ructible.
B005C9GNDC|4|Get the Hanes knit boxers, they're more comfortable.
B00RWR2CAU|5|Bought this for my sister as a birthday gift!  She loved it... was exactly what she wanted.  Thanks!
B00KQ4ELGO|5|I love them!
B00NAFI2NE|5|I was very hesitant to buy a maxi dress online, but boy I'm sure glad I did!  Usually when I try on maxi dresses, they're either too long, too short, too low, see through, unflattering, and just overall wrong.  Just like jeans, usually I need to try it on before I buy it.  I took a chance with this one based on 1 good review, and it ended up being perfect!    I'm 5'2, weigh 105 pounds, and have a 32C bust.  I'm usually an x-small on the bottom, but a small or sometimes even medium for my tops.  You can only imagine how hard it is to find a maxi dress to accommodate my figure.  The V-neck line is very flattering and offers just the right amount of coverage.  The elastic waistline falls perfectly on the waist, not too high and not too low.  I was also VERY surprised that the length stopped right at my ankle.  Usually I have to hem any maxi dress I buy.    I've tried on so many maxi dresses from Splendid, Ella Moss, Velvet, C&C, and many other name brands, but have failed to find one that fits as perfectly as this one did....and it's half or even a third of the price!  I really want one in every color!  I also noticed this brand sells a maxi dress with cap sleeves!  I figured I'll buy this one for the weekends, and the cap sleeve maxi for work!  As a new mom, nothing excites me more than filling my entire closet with maxi dresses!!  Great way to feel great even though you may have only slept 2 hours and feel like a complete mess.    I would highly recommend this maxi dress!
B00K07ALIY|3|I thought it would be a little larger than this. I ordered a C and it fits like a B.
B008LWS2TK|5|I ordered these and they were way too big, seller was great on the return
B0077S2PPG|5|Just what I was looking for, I have difficulty taking it off! Warm, very comfortable, nice looking. I probably will get another to wear when this one is being washed!
B00C94IH7S|1|The first one star item I grant on Amazon, this is why  thin material almost transparent in the photos looks like its so warm and comfy....It ran a little small and was cheaply made. The zipper was even poor quality to bad I didn't get the jacket in the photo they show only a rag to dry my car with...
B004J723U0|5|So cute and well made
B009PNSP4G|1|When I ordered these I was under the impression that they were metal, especially since the description said they are metal.  These are plastic and not great plastic.  I hope they make it through one wearing.
B00WDW3XV6|5|I bought a 7. My kid is almost 8. 4 ft. 48lbs. I knew it would be a little to big and it came just as excepted.
B004XVFCOQ|5|all was as expected, excuse me  I don´t know that i have to fill in this option, see you later
B0058CW594|5|Fits just as I knew it would and from prior experience, I know there will be no or at least very minimal shrinkage in the wash.
B00EEEBWUU|5|Very cute bikini! I am 5 foot tall and I have a B cup and this bikini was actually a little bigger than I thought it would be, but not by much. The cups are very comfortable, shapely, kind of made from a foam but NOT like Victoria secret push ups bras or bikini tops. The beading is very bright and decorative. I really love this top and purchased the bottoms as well (equally as cute). If you surf I don't recommend wearing this top as the beading is a little fragile. Over all, very cute suit! Love Billabong!
B00B1FCC2M|5|Gave this shirt as a gift, they like it
B00QPF90R8|5|My daughter wore this for a cos play event in Seattle. This is a quality wig, soft and style-able for a very affordable cost. Thank you!
B004Q1R3VS|5|Great
B00AMDRAX0|5|I have this shirt in pink and in white.  it was pricey but i really love the way it fits and easy wash..and how it looks on..wprth every penny...
B00BJJJM6Y|1|I would never buy this t-shirt again. The material is very thin and the quality of the letters is awful! The blue color of the letters are not dark blue, they are light blue and bad printed!
B00QHYIXVG|5|Very Comfortable!!  No ride ups!!
B005GYGGYE|5|LOVE THEM. So flattering that i bough another pair. So soft, fits as expected, great price. Keeps you warm. Fabric doesn't pile. Trust me any body shape will look great in these!
B00DF1FSR6|4|I was quite satisfied with this item.
B008H2ETBE|5|These crew socks are exactly what I expected, I am a size 9 1/2 and they fit fine and arrived on time
B00GUYU31G|5|LOVE THEM
B009PHDXVW|5|Excellent price!
B0052HRJNM|5|Muy buen producto y de gran calidad, lo recomiendo, a mi hijo lle encantaron para sus clases de f&uacute;tbol. .
B004R8RTLE|5|Great pair of work pants. Did not expect anything less than perfect.
B004K3YTG4|5|Great costume, but you have to have a good body, cuz it will show any rolls of fat etc.
B004VFMRUG|5|I bought this flower headband to accessorize my granddaughter's Christmas dress.  It is the perfect color red and the flower looks just like it did online.  The headband is soft and even fits small infant heads without leaving a mark.
B00I8A6404|3|If you have a larger head / big hair this hat will not fit. It is very beautiful for the price, so I ended up giving it to one of my friends that has a smaller head / thinner hair and it fit her perfect.
B004JAGBJG|5|Fit was good, shorts were without any defects.
B00BDHS3NK|5|Fits well and the material has just the right weight.  I like the color contrast between the inner lining and the exterior.
B00EPFM374|4|Perfect for a Duck Dynasty lover!
B00991UG6E|4|The jacket is just a little snug on me, but I have broad shoulders. It also took two days longer to arrive than the estimated time. However, it is very stylish and good looking, and put together well. It was just what I needed for the colder nights when I go out.
B00DAMR0V2|4|I ordered this in the stripped greenish and white color. It looked very good on however it was a little see threw not terrible but just to be on the save side I stuck a white slip on under it. Where it changes colors you can feel the ridges inside the dress on your skin. It got use to it right away and it felt comfortable. All and all it was a good dress and for the price I can't complain to much.
B0080Q75G8|2|Loved the look just wasn't a comfortable material. Also didn't fit quite right, also the zipper just didn't make sense.
B00IVPJONA|5|Love this tank. Fast delivery.
B00ACIFP5U|5|Great stuff.
B000P9CBUI|5|This is a bra that I have been wearing for some time but is not available in Canada anymore for some reason.....  always the way with things you love.  It's a great fit and very comfortable and supportive without digging wires.
B00ENZ63O0|3|It works great. The only thing about mine is that it rips a lot and I got the right size.
B006DWABXA|4|I like how the wig looks like real hair but its a little longer then in the picture.But I was happy to see it came with a wig cap! :D So Now I can cosplay as Shizuo!
B00IUK8K6S|4|Quality of the gown is amazing! Runs a little on th big side
B007I4HIL0|5|Mountain Tees are the best.
B00LGJV2QA|4|good fit, nice quality. Bows in the back show thru some clothes.
B0036FFAMY|5|Great shirt! Fast delivery!
B00AWNEBQE|2|I liked the material and construction of these shorts, but they are either made for somebody a lot taller than I am, or a lot older than I am that likes his pants to come up to his armpits.  The legs seemed huge, and I don't have small legs.  I wanted them to fit because they seemed to be of excellent quality, but alas, they had to go back.
B0076R6KY0|4|I bought this for my BF. He's 5'8&#34;, 170 lbs (Marine, not buff but very toned) and it fits him perfectly..A bit on the lose side, but it leaves room for layering clothes underneath. Its very warm, but I do wish it came with a hoodie :(
B002I9RMB6|5|Love this nightgown.  Had one in a 2T that she outgrew, so bought one in a larger size.  Very nice quality and washes and wears great.
B008ER5WWW|5|My 2 yr old daughter loves this dress.  She happily wore it for Thanksgiving and for family photos.  It washes well too.  I didn't put it in the dryer.
B00HSQK7BG|3|so so...
B00S26TKB4|3|Loved it but was a Lil larger then I had expected
B00GOXD03G|2|The dress is cute, but too small and the color is much greener than expected. I am returning it. I love the rest of the Neon Buddha clothing I have gotten from Amazon but this one is just &#34;off&#34; for some reason.
B00AK4ISOQ|3|Cute color and nice fit, but a bit see through.  Clings to the hips a bit too much for my liking. A girl with narrower hips may love it though. That, and with the transparency and I could only wear this around the house.  Fortunately my friend tried it on and liked it so she's taking it home. :-)
B0018OMPQE|5|I purchased a pair of silver rigid shrink-to-fit Levi's 501 and a pair of black fill shrink-to-fit Levi's 501. I have worn similar jeans for fifty years. Before my purchase I read many of the reviews and it is clear many customers are not reading the description provided for the products. My STF 501 were perfect. They shrink just like they always have. I'm 6' 0 and purchased 33 w x 36.  I lost maybe 1/2 inch in the waist and 3 inches in length after washing in warm water and air drying.  All future washings will be in cold water.  The original 501 STF RIGIDS were exactly like all my old ones ... same fabric weight.  The black fills were not as heavy as the RIGIDS and they were NOT advertised  to be the same. Nevertheless, I love them. Both are perfect and my new favorites!!!! They both appear to be original authentic Levi's!!! No fakes here!!
B00XXAMQEM|5|very good quality overall, with print very nice and material
B00K5TP8DK|4|Good price fast shipping
B002DMRDY4|5|so this was a surprise shirt for a friend and his surprise luau party. the shirt fit perfectly and it was really nice looked like it was made well.
B005GYGFZ4|5|muy buen producto la mujer encantada con esto lo unico es que deberian envalarlo mas pequeño para que el envio no sea tan costoso
B0043JOCTY|5|Bought this for Travel or when I'm out wearing a suit. I must say this 7 slot Credit Card holder/organizer is great and carries all the cards I need away from home. I'm sure you can find a cheaper one but this one seems to have the best workmanship and having a ruffled surface assures you a better grip when using. It has an easy opening mechanism that should hold up to time and frequent usage. The RFID protection is also a plus, since I put my US Passport Card in there knowing I'm protected and nobody can access my info.
B007C4GHS6|5|Perfect for my nb tiny feet. Doesnt fall off
B00IDYT3VC|2|My daughter is 10m, she is tiny and little longer for her age. This 18m romper is too tight under arms and fits her per length now. The material is soft but looks cheap as its color too. Will return.
B002PILQOO|5|my daughter looked like an angel on her baptism day! its comfortable; did not wrinkle and it was pretty hot that day;  my daughter was exactly 6 months on her baptism day and as a side note, she is almost the size of a 9 month old - hope that helps!!!<br />lovely gown - we will surely pass it down to our cousin.
B0037W704C|4|Pretty good for a economical-sized wallet. The pockets are the right size and plentiful to carry 6+ cards, and the cards will not slip out. I just wished that the wallet had a more leathery feel instead of a glossy and smooth feel and that the the cash holding slot was bigger; I have to fold the bills into thirds if I don't want the money to peek out.
B00A09D8Q4|1|This &#34;crape&#34; seems to be only cheap polyester. Not at all worth what I paid.
B001RZ02LY|5|fits well and even hides my stretch marks (lol) which is which I why I bought the product. cute on!
B0009MZY5A|5|I have found that these socks make walking more comfortable for me since I have orthotics in my shoes.  Before these, I felt that I was walking on a board on my hard orthotics.  Great for wicking moisture away from feet, too.
B00K2F5VAW|4|These look great and are exactly what I was looking for in this price range. They feel great, however DON'T PULL ON ANY LOOSE THREADS. Make sure they are not inside out when washing. One of the sock threads got tangled in the washer and was pulled so that it now has a hole. It's ok since it was my least favorite pair and I got 5 more. But just a warning
B00186XQDI|3|I bought the blue hippos for my year old son who was starting to walk all over the place.  the slippers fit ok, and though a bit chunky they were light enough for him.  the reason that i gave these only three stars it that the toes on these are easily worn and after the second time they looked beat up.
B00NPCC9P4|5|My wife absolutely loves this shirt. From the fit to the design, its just perfect. She gets compliments all the time when she is wearing her shirt.
B007BLNNPU|5|EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
B00RDW4AGS|5|Love it.
B00NL4TRME|5|VERY GOOD VALUE VERY STURDY
B00FT2SBPA|4|Cute hats, good quality, true to size.
B00XQG585W|4|Nice wallet and one of the more reasonably priced RFID Blockers I could find. Thanks!
B007UPM8M6|5|Very happy with these.  Popped the old, scratched Oak lenses out and these snapped right in, now my Fuel Cells are new as day one.  Also like the fact they allow 22% light through, most lenses out there are so dark these days.
B0000YWPF4|5|I took this bag with me to India and my friends in Bombay loved it so much, the made me leave it with them!  It is a great bag and holds your mat, a rug and your clothes easily.  I have used it several times for a weekend trip (I bought a new one when I got back from India) and it fits everything and my mat just perfectly.  There is a large roomy pocket on the side(which fits a paperback, ipod, and wallet nicely) and handles both on top and on the side which is great when negotiating tight spaces (a plane aisle, the subway or a crowded Indian train station...)   <br /> <br />It is so much more than a flimsy little cloth bag that fits only your mat and nothing else!  The cargo is totally high tech and built to last forever it would seem.
B00S15SAZI|4|Very cute suit, just runs a little small.
B00TEVGG4U|5|Very cute bathing suit top!! Fit as expected!!
B00D8XJXSG|5|I just ordered this coat and I love It!  It fits true to size and is well made.  For the price, I don't think you can beat it!
B000VCHOAQ|4|Cool enough, I like. I just wish the symbols were brighter, as they actually look kinda grey. Good product overall.
B006SU1TUG|5|I was impressed with the quality of the clothes. This outfit has cute little details that give it more of a boutique feel, like the ribbon on the seahorse and the bow at the back. They fit a little small, so I would suggest buying one size up. (My daughter is 12 weeks old & 11lbs and the 6 month size fits perfectly.)
B005LAFSRO|1|I was looking forward to some comfy pj's so I ordered a large to be sure there would be plenty of room.  When I put them on I felt like I ordered an extra small.  Expensive for pj's and very disappointed in the size.
B002X57VSE|4|Love MJ and this shirt, but I would suggest ordering in a size or two higher up because these shirts do run on the smaller side.
B00JGM7DEY|3|Wouldve been five star but run a lil too large
B00KFXAP2K|1|Order 2 sizes up
B003GXFTV8|5|perfect
B003RA2SA0|5|The texture of the cap is comfortable and soft. It is also stylish (at least for me). The actual size may be a little bigger than baseball cap. I wear 7 1/2 size for baseball cap but this one is a little bit bigger than my baseball cap. However, my head can still fit in. :P
B00OWDJ73M|5|very good...^^
B00802ZUE6|5|Perfect solution for women with arthritic shoulders.  Warm enough for 0 degrees with fleece underneath. Fashionable outer wear for casual or dress-up.
B00JZKWC2K|2|I am. Size 14.  This dress was way to small and I am returning it. Even after reading other reviews I went up a size. Too bad cute dress.
B000P8ZNKY|5|Just the right size, and was reasonably priced. I love how they have the motorcycle on the pendant and the wording is perfect. It's very nice.
B0083J32Z0|5|love the material, fit as expected
B00B0DGWSK|2|To tight..
B008MX2L6I|2|Very cute but the jeweled pieces started coming off in less than three months. Not a long-lasting item. Would not buy it again.
B00EMB67VO|5|Get a bigger size.... I love mine!!
B005GYGG0S|3|One of the pairs outta 3 we're cut when I received them? ( box cutter ) by the looks of it ... Waste of money on that one but the other two were great as always
B00HWFCTBE|2|It was way too large plus I was expecting Jersey.  To me Jersey is silky not cotton.<br />They were also extremely long.  Just definately not for me.
B005GVGXDG|4|They stretch out as you wear them but they feel wonderful and look exactly like denim. I would get the straight leg as the boot cut is a little wide but I will make them work. If they had just a touch of elastic in the waist it would make it easier to fit.
B0002TV2RE|2|I supposed I may just be spoiled by fine, soft wools, but these socks are made of some of the scratchiest, least pleasant wool-blend fabric I've experienced. As a sock, they function just fine - I prefer a slightly tighter fit than these (as the Gold Toe nylons tend to be), but have not had any issues with them falling down, so functionally they are tight enough. But the fabric itself just isn't comfortable, it doesn't transparently blend in with my body and form a second skin. It's very apparent, and rather unpleasant. I'll keep these around, as socks do have a way of going missing and losing their mates, but I certainly won't be buying any more.
B00BFASC9K|4|It is pretty, and I love it. The only thing is that it has see through in the yellow bottom part. Also, the random blue bow thing...it fits good. The collar also was quite different and it was red and white, not the traditional SnowWhite, but I love it.
B00X3A7MA0|5|needs abit more boob coverage on the sides
B001O4CCD4|5|So comfy and soft and not too hot. !  love the cuffs on the pants.
B00SO71CG2|3|The interior label is somewhat annoying when running.  I cut it out as best as possible.  There isn't a secure pocket for ID or a key.
B00A4AK0DS|2|I was miffed when I got this. You could at least put an accurate picture, as the tights I got weren't bad quality or anything. They're much more of a cool, blueish teal than a rich yellow-based green, and they're less shiny or opaque.. I got them for a costume, and chose the item based on color so yeah, rude.
B0019LN9ZW|3|Good hat. the green one is what i wanted, so i got it. but its not as green. its still however a pretty awesome hat.  Plus gravity has really good customer service and their delivery was SUPER fast. k good luck hat hunting!
B000YQJD3U|4|Love this bra, its super comfortable, it doesn't pain me any where, and can wear for a very long day. I feel like I look normal when I wear it (unlike most nursing bras where the main function is support, this has both support and shape).<br /><br />The only thing I would change is the connector strap that hold the bra strap to the bra (the one that's inside the cup); I would love to see it made a little bit heartier, it gets stretched out during the day so wile pumping or nursing it slips down. Conversely though it doesn't put a lot of pressure on the breast that leaves the ducts feeling plugged....<br /><br />I also wish the nude was a little bit more darker hue to be a little \\"sexier\\" like the victoria secret color instead of light sandy khaki tan... but whob know maybe its available to buy and I missed it.<br /><br />All in all great bra and I plan to buy a few more! :-)
B00GWZMM4O|2|Not true boys size 18 .Grandson wears a 16 slim had to return  pants too small. That's why I. Gave it 2
B005SW05VY|2|I've worn these before and they were great. But this time, they didn't send what was promised. As you can see from the picture and description, I was supposed to be sent underwear that was black with white trim, size large for 42- to 46-inch hips. What actually arrived was navy blue with no trim, size large for 35- to 40-inch hips. The color isn't important, but the size is. They were unwearable. I credit the company for giving me a full refund, but I had to go on my international trip without any of these underwear, and now I'm not sure whether it's safe to order from them again.
B007WEGOV6|5|Was exactly as described on line. Good quality and lots of pockets for all my gift cards . I would buy again.
B00RPOZZOU|5|Over the years I've bought gloves not paying attention to quality until now. These gloves are everything as advertised; looks and comfort.
B00MZ51CZA|4|Really warm
B00JLKRFY4|1|These people are croocks, i mailed back the pants because they were far far to small, only a child could fit, yet they kept the pants and my money, &#34;THEIVES&#34;
B000CESGUK|1|No jeans fit right anymore. Trying to find a loose pair of jeans with decent pockets is next to impossible now. I have made the switch to cargo pants for life. Also, I wear a 36 in every brand I have tried, and these are goofy huge! For a loose fit, they sure do have a fat waist and skinny thighs...
B00BOJC68U|5|I don't usually buy clothes online because I am worried about how they will fit or if the picture is an accurate representation of them. I LOVED THIS SHIRT! Even prettier in person. I received it in great condition and it was wrapped well. I am 5'4&#34; and 140 lbs and the medium fits me well (the size measurements the site offers were spot on for me).<br /><br />Can't wait to wear it out! The cloth feels soft and it just looked/fit as I was hoping.
B0016H18K2|4|This is a very nice, bright, light and airy dress -- perfect for summer!  My girls are wearing them in my wedding next month.  I got one in every color! I would recommend ordering one size up from your regular size though, as they seem to run just alittle small.
B000O0OOCQ|5|It is exactly as the picture shows.  Solid twill baseball cap with clearly defined embroidered logo, as shown.  Not the airey kind of \\"summer\\" hat, so it's really a \\"winter\\" hat.  My son is an electrician and loves the haz-mat logo, so I got it for his 34th birthday, along with some other stuff. S-h-h-h-h.  Don't tell him.  His birthday is 4 days away and I want to surprise him with this nice hat.<br /><br />And, no, the guy does NOT come with the hat.  Duh!  Even I knew that!
B00J8IDLTM|5|I love this top!!! The fit was perfect. I ordered the yellow in a large, I usually wear a medium. It was just as pictured. The fabric is really soft and light not see through at all, perfect for the summer. I can't wait to wear it!!!
B000JHCYNK|5|I gave five stars cause these are real nice and fit real good and are warm they are exactly what I was wanting<br />As far as shipping I ordered these on prime which all of you know that it's two day free shipping and it took 3 days to get them no big deal in guessing a mix up happened at the warehouse but I did get them first thing in the morning on that third day so I would recommend these to everyone they are of what you are expecting
B00B9AN41C|4|Nice fit comfortable and still look good after washing. First time buying Lee Womens Plus sized Classic Boot cut jeans. Will purchase again.
B00R8ZXGGA|5|Love them!!!!
B00BMLUULU|4|Love this dress. Great fit, lovely pattern. I've only worn it for a wedding and to another church event. The pockets are great. I'm wondering if I can wear this to work??
B00JJICQ4C|5|This is a repeat purchase in another color they are good.
B00L9BSA8I|4|nice suit
B00GMO6DRM|4|Nice pack, but beware... this is not a &#34;ready to go&#34; backpack or haversack. This is a piece of military kit from WWII that is meant to be packed a specific way, with specific military issue items (shovel, tent poles, straps that latch onto an ammo belt, etc). It will take some work to customize it if you want to wear it on a hiking trip - the main pouch is simply a piece of folded canvas that allows smaller items to fall out. If you like to travel light, however, the work involved getting this pack into shape is worth the effort.
B00O9WVFLS|2|Although it looks just how it is in the picture it was baggy on me but it fits my mom perfect and we're both small it's also very thin but it's worth it unique and cute
B001OR9PUO|3|Were ok not as strong as before. But service the propers
B000J688HC|5|I am so happy with my new opera gloves, they're exactly what i wanted and the satin texture is luscious if at times a bit warm. I bought them for a costume and they look perfect! Also, the sellers were very nice and I would totally work with them again.
B00NX9PVC2|4|Great for the price perfect for my cruse! Last minute buy but still elegant and blue is exact same as photo. Runs snug!
B00AQ6IWXK|4|I am in love with it! It is so genuine I need more in diff colors! This one makes me want to study the culture.
B00B2JIJQ0|4|Unless you are a 6 ft tall runway model, this dress feels a bit boxy, without a taper.  It's a pretty dress though.  It came on time and it washes well.
B00FDND8F8|5|I wear small and ordered Large. It was perfect!  The material wasn't as thick as expected but it's comfy and cozy. Not for a super cold weather.
B002S56JXW|3|Good quality for the price. Was disappointed that it did not have internal pockets. My previous jacket had pockets and I paid about the same price.
B002SW3EVA|5|These glasses are great. They fit perfectly on my 4 month old and she looks adorable in them!
B00KN1AU7E|5|My boyfriend is from Texas and loves everything Texas related... I bought these for him as a surprise and he loves them and they are true to size. Would def buy again!
B00FFYN21K|5|The turtleneck fits perfectly and looks great!
B005EOL632|5|The fit was as excepted. I purchased the shirts for my father. He was pleased. I will order again in the near future.
B00EKN6S68|5|Fantastic design and quality
B00007GD9N|5|This is a exceptinioal wallet. It folds down extremely small and has all the holding power you may need. It wears well because it is a buxton wallet. I would reccomend this wallet to any person wanting a small rigid wallet that is durable.
B00TI7NVM0|5|Great shirt for my husband.  Looks just as pictured.  Soft cotton fabric.
B000MX0EXS|5|Actually the bra fits great, except the top cup is somewhat large for the person  I bought it for.  Just took a couple of darts in it and she thinks it is great. Better than any I have found locally.
B00QKR6TR0|5|The right fit and my little boy loves them! No job to big. No pup too small. My little boy is on a roll. Well, into bed anyway;)
B003R94YPS|4|We were very surprised as to how cute this is.  She looked great!<br />We got th<br />Is outfit at a b<br />Arguing price
B005HFC81C|2|My husband and his boss bought several of these shirts in Sping 2014<br /><br />They loved them at first.  However there are problems that need to be resolved:<br /><br />1. First they easily wrinkly and are  pain in the neck to Iron.<br />2. Lots of snags, nothing like I have seen in any other material.<br /><br />These might be good for occasional wear, but if you want to wear them 1 time a week, you will get about 3-4 painful months of having to iron and remove snags.
B007KAHQN2|5|My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves her HoodiePet.  She has the pink hoodie sweatshirt with the plush bunny toy.  When she received the hoodie in the mail she immediately wanted to wear it.  In general she is pretty picky about what clothes and materials she will wear - but she instantly liked this hoodie!  It is very soft and fit her wonderfully.  I chose to get the size 5/6 so she could grow into it.  It fits her well now and should fit her for quite a while.  She couldn't wait to show her new shirt to everyone  :)  I would highly recommend this product.  It would make a great gift  :)
B00DEVK5MA|5|GREAT
B00BOX0ISQ|1|I was very upset when I tried this dress on after finding out the 2x is surely not true to size at all.  It would fit a very slim woman better.  Thats certainly not the size of a 2x.  Beautiful dress but not enough material usedto make it a 2x!
B007FFR7K4|5|My son is 6'4&#34; tall. Wears a 30x36. He hates slim fit jeans, because according to him, &#34;I cant play basketball or bend down&#34; in anything but these.  Bought 2 pair last year and he wore the heck out of them, still wearing them and purchased 2 more pair this year, same size and color, and they have no noticeable difference in shading. This means, in my opinion, the color is true and doesn't fade much.<br /><br />Great quality as well, and the seller was great to work with.
B000U9WXCE|5|Wonderful, durable product
B006RSN376|2|not same as shown in image and picture. different result not even used even twice need to be more clear about product not ripping people off.
B00O9XBBDO|5|Great gift
B00JJEQZ6Q|5|It's very good
B00KWGVWNG|2|Had holes in some socks near the toe.
B00L10YSBA|1|size is inaccurate
B00LHSLS82|4|okay
B00BTHUL52|4|This suit fits great, looks cute, is comfortable and arrived early. Got lots of compliments when I wore it last weekend.
B005CSO3V2|5|I am size S and I bought S and fitted perfect. Very comftable. I do exercise every day and I wash it daily and still in good conditions.
B003TT9RO4|3|when i try them on the zipper didn't go up or dwon so I only used the laseis to the boots and when i did try the zipper it broke so i got<br /><br />rid of them.
B00H26IT1M|3|As is usual in this type of garment, the waist and inseam sizes fluctuate. In the store I usually have to try on several pairs to find one that fits correctly. The pair I received were long enough but too tight in the waist, and yes, my waist size is a 35!<br /><br />I would like to return these in exchange for another pair that might just fit in the waist. How do I do that?
B00CCA5P3S|5|it fits well the material is comfortable!!! never came across anything like it!!! great buy !!! i'm in love with it!!
B00KVM4PE4|5|Exactly what I wanted. Arrived on time and in proper packaging. Three black pair and three other colors(orange, yellow, blue) . I will order again when I need too.
B00CXMP8E6|5|Nice and fits as expected.
B002F1ULYC|1|I received other product, not the original ( was changed but I did not receive an alert ).<br />This is my first purchase.<br />I offered to return the product. I have my mail box in Miami, and the product was shipped to Chile. I pay international taxes. IS very difficult for me to return the product to the U.S.. would have to pay all over again.<br />The logical thing would be to send me a similar product for free as compensation
B00K59KDB2|3|We purchased this product for our 16 year old.  While tall, he is not heavy, certainly not obese, but the hoodie was way too tight accross his chest, necessitating a return of the product.  Too bad because it is a nice design!
B00HG7HMSS|3|nice jacket; fit is just too small, especially the arms( too short)
B00CFR7EIW|5|I thought this was going to be a cheaply-made hat but the material is sturdy, yet soft and flexible.  And the color is exactly as shown.  Definitely pleased and planning to get more.  This is a great hat for the price.. really....
B00LUYM5T4|5|Nice - fits!!
B0006U04LY|5|Super soft and comfortable.
B0077BXVNI|4|tela suave muy bien para ser de bebe. solo que se ve muy clara por der tan delgada la tela
B00GBRJNPO|5|These fit my 8 year old perfectly. She's 4 foot tall and 65 lbs. These are super cute.
B00MERKXZE|5|It was comfortable.
B00YAUXU6W|2|I was so excited to give this wallet to my husband as a father's day gift from our daughter, however when I received the item it was not as pictured. I ordered according to the item pictured, appearing as a left handed wallet - chain on the right, but received a right handed wallet - chain on the left. The quality of the wallet was great, which is why I rated 2 stars.
B00CBCFQK4|5|This sweater is oh so cute with jeans and is a perfect fit. You can dress it up with a pair of slacks. The fabric is soft and cuddly.
B00IJGDS24|5|My daughter loves them. They fit well under a skirt and look great. The fit is perfect. She is 125 lbs. any larger and they would be too<br />small.
B00427WWEE|5|Order came quickly, as described and true to size!  Cant wait for our future little quarterback to start wearing it soon. :)
B0057X9Y34|1|Seam came out around the neck after three wearings.  Horrible quality.
B00KFZQVIU|3|Runs super small. The design is cute,<br />The material is see through and thin.
B00GJ5QDV0|5|This was purchase as a gift. My nephew really like it
B005BB9OWS|5|These pants are comfortable to wear for sleeping, exercise, casual and maybe even business attire, if a good shirt is found to go with it.
B007BID4T8|5|It's like a soft, warm, flattering dress that looks cute and classy with leggings, skinny jeans, or suit pants. It ends just below my behind, and looks great with a thin or thick belt and boots or flats.
B001DEPTKI|3|When I ordered this scarf a year ago, it was very soft and warm--my boyfriend loved it and it went so well with his overcoat.  After a year of wearing it about once a week, it is starting to ball up in places.  Great scarf, but won't last very long.
B002INKSG8|5|This Egyptian costume worked well for an ice skating show costume with the song &#34;Walk Like an Egyptian.&#34;<br />Accessories were fine.
B00B1STOA2|4|Bought this for someone else. Haven't heard any complaints, so I guess it meets their needs. Good turn around process.
B00B79DS52|5|My daughter loves these. She wears them more than the princesses. Then runs around saving the world. Please add more female super heroes. Thank you!!!
B00BFHRUXC|2|Way too small!  I had to return it.
B00IGP00R4|4|It's cute, I'm a B and it's a bit small in the chest, but aside from that I really like it. I'm 5' 6&#34; 160lbs, fit's good.
B00GTKVQ1M|5|My daughter just love it, and so do  her friends.
B005OFLSWK|5|Fit right, well made, appropriate price.
B00ECWAOF8|3|Arms short. But its very warm. My friends said it looked great on me..its sporty and soft. I wish I had more colors
B0083H6RBI|5|Bought this to give to a friend. Told me she loved it.<br />I love Lauren Burch's designs. Am a fan of hers.
B004URA6S0|5|bought this as a joke so that we could see how long it took for family to get it loved it
B00CHFBPMS|5|This is nicer than expected. I'm 5'6\\", 138 pounds and it fits me fine, a couple of inches above my ankles... loose, but attractively so. I think this would work for anyone from size 6 to 14. There are slits on the sides (about 8 inches or so) which is a nice feature. The fabric is soft, satiny and fairly rich looking for polyester. It seems best suited for spring and fall or a cool summer night; not for very hot weather.
B0018P1WP8|5|Excellent quality, soft and comfortable in sitting for long drive or flight
B006TSRBEK|5|The hat is very comfy and light; perfect for cosplaying! Hat looks like the picture as well. I haven't tried the mustache yet since I have my own.<br /><br />&#34;Open kit, use kit; Waluigi time!&#34;
B00CTUVV9I|2|I have always wanted one of these ruffle shirts.  I guess I will have to look in women's plus sizes
B008USN22M|5|Making me excited enough to login just to review this scarf is a feat--seriously the best garment I've got for $55!  It looks much better than te photo as well; more deep blues and rich reds.  Definitely wearing this all the time!  Also, it's not made in Lithuania as described, it's made in SCOTLAND!  Kick ass!
B00KU1MJ4E|3|I looked specifically for pants with adjustable waiste and the description of these pants stated that it has one. It's not true - there is NO ELASTIC BAND and no way to adjust the waiste if it's too big. My son is 8 and is skinny - the pants are just falling off him. I needed the pants to arrive promptly for an occasion but unfortunately had to return this pair, which left me quite disappointed and without a new pair of navy pants for my son... Overall quality seemed good but will have to return them.
B003ES599C|5|i wear a G cup and this thing holds me in tightly it is a great sports bra and i would buy it over and over again.  the price is reasonable and the quality is superb.  I may buy a band size bigger next time it is a tiny bit snug but really overall the fit is great
B00P9LIP4I|1|100% Acrylic not cotton as advertised
B005YO5P3E|5|My son loves the jeans. A person can never go wrong with Levi's. They fit and look great.Minimal shrinkage. Durable.
B00KMDWEPE|5|Love them
B00M24ML0Y|5|my daughter loves
B00AG07NKY|5|My husband loves these.
B0089NTEWU|2|Sizing runs small.  If in doubt order a size larger than you normally would.  They were returned and credited to my acct quickly and easily!
B00AKAZMSK|3|The color is really cute...the style is cute...I'll wear around the house...but it's really cheap quality, not not well made, one belt loop was already broken when I got it and the material is not that nice.  I did see other dresses from this company that I thought were cute online, but I'll pass b/c of the the quality.
B005KKALQS|5|Had a Dorfman Pacific bucket hat with a slightly narrower brim and wore it for several years whenever I left the house. Literally wore the top out of it because that's where i grabbed it to take it off. This one seems better built, thicker fabric and better seams and thicker thread, just more substantial, so expect the same and more with this one.
B001KNXUFI|3|We got this quickly and in great shape. My husband wore it as part of his Halloween costume and it was great, however when my son wore it to church the next week, the center fabric ripped off and the entire thing fell apart.
B00Y5PGBCM|4|Good quality, nice amount of pockets, and like the zipper.<br />Would have liked a photo holder with it but not included.
B00NOAL4WG|5|Great graphics and nice fit. My son loves this shirt!
B00I1LTD9E|3|Bag looks great and is a good size for a weekend trip.  I just wish that the carrying strap had metal clasps rather than plastic.  Not sure how long the clips will last with some wear and tear.  I also wish that the bottom of the bag was a little more reinforced because with a little bit of dragging back and forth on the ground I already see some wearing.
B00AW83IJA|4|I love this top; it's so cute. Ordered a size up from what I'd normally buy in a shirt since I'm wide-hipped and was looking for tunics. Love how it fits and feels. Highly recommended if you a tunic and leggings sort. : )
B00G3ORI02|4|Very cute, but fit too large. I normally wear a 10-12 and it fit like a 14-16.
B003MRQ37M|1|The shirt, although sized correctly, was not well made. The sleeve cuffs were poorly attached and the front edges of the collar did not stay positioned correctly. Had to get another tie since the one that came with the shirt did not fit properly. Am glad it was only for one night's wear.
B001JE72Z2|5|Very cool, no built up hat heat on the top of the head, no emblems, advertisements on it, blank space, perfect.  Have always disliked wearing 'advertisements' on my head for some company, corporation.  This visor fills the bill!  Yes, I know, a bit 'punny'!
B00B4ZJWWC|2|Too small
B00NKXCSBI|4|I like it, I'm a 34B, it is a little big but I will still wear it. If you are a C or higher I think your boobs wouldn't fit in the cups. Probably won't last if you wear it all the time but occasional use should be fine. It's too cold here for me to try it. This one will have to wait until summer.
B007PYE4YC|5|We love Bjorn Borg gear, 100% cotton! quality made! fit well! wash well<br />We will buy more for sure in the future
B00DXY625M|5|My 5 year old grandson was so proud of the robe.  Instead of running through the house with new pair shoes,  he related it with a robe
B00BQN1OT6|5|Love this jacket-the color is vibrant, the material is linen-light and cool- and the cut is fabulous-I got mine in large, to give it a slouchy feel.  Got tons of compliments.  My favorite of all time.
B00MX4CFCC|4|From the reviews I read beforehand I found that the general consensus was to order larger, since the product runs small. I did so, ordering a large, versus my normal medium size and this product worked out great! I was pleased with shipping and fit/make of the merchandise.  I would recommend this.
B005GLWSTE|5|I ordered these and some cotton JMS briefs at the same time.  These are the cut described by the seller and the fit and fabric are excellent.  I plan to order these again.  I do NOT plan to order the JMS again.  What was delivered by JMS was not as pictured or described.  Careless, poor quality control or deliberate substitution - don't know.  Do know I will choose THIS seller again, never JMS.
B00MLO0AQW|4|It is a little deceiving and it looks better when your arms are down. When you lift them up you look like a bird with a wide torso. But I won't be lifting my arms up and down a lot in this top so I should be okay!
B00GKZV0M6|3|The shirt has held up to multiple washings and wearings.<br />I would buy again. We receive  lots of funny comments/laughs on and off the vball court when wearing this.
B00HR9IONC|5|Best secret socks ever!
B00KLXYJWG|5|My daughter tried it on and it fits her so good she loves it and that makes me happy
B0009MZXZQ|5|Love these-I bought smalls and they really fit!
B00JHZSWMW|4|I tried to order a size based on the reviews already so I ordered their &#34;xxl&#34;. I'm 5'5 160 pounds, 38D. Bottoms are a little loose-ish but very comfortable and they look great not being skin tight. Top fits but maybe a tad small.. I feel as though the top fits better when flipped upside down and tied that way. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase!
B0094E9G4E|5|These fit my 13 year old daughter perfectly - she's a bit curvy and they aren't too snug anywhere.  She even wants to sleep in them! The logo on the back looks to be pretty durable and not peel off like some other pants we've had. It's a mini bootcut so it gives you the long leg appeal but without making you flop your pants at the ankles.
B00JGSXGF8|4|I'm plus size and ordered a 3x. Definitely hangs off my shoulder, a little tight at the bottom but loosened up after second wear! Will be ordering more of them!!!! #LoveIt
B0002VN8FQ|5|Fit well.  Great for all kinds of athletic workouts.  I'm ready to buy a couple more pairs.
B000W6VSOO|4|Do not like has too much metel trim,  I ordered 36 and it is smaler than the other 36's I use so too small.
B000XVRL76|5|This jacket is about as warm a jacket that is needed in this area. the lining gives you a feel like you are nestled under a blanket but yet the jacket is so lightweight.
B00HUAW4Q6|5|My daughter will love this for Christmas i am very pleased with this purchase!!!
B00E68U9G2|3|I ordered these scrubs in XS (I am 5'4, 113lbs and 3 months pregnant). They are WAY too big. I know the belly part would be too big at this point, but they don't stay up at all. The hips and legs are huge and do not seem like an XS. They will probably be great when I am at 7 months and beyond, but I was hoping for something I could start wearing now because my regular scrubs are digging into my belly.
B000OGXLEM|4|When these arrived I thought they looked rather thin. Didn't know what to expect when I wore them in the cold. Was pleasantly surprised at how warm they actually kept my ears.
B00F86CTBO|5|Perfect fit for my son and very fast shipping great buying experience
B00JEM5EAQ|5|Expected shipping date is tomorrow, received today. I was very skeptical on ordering this from the reviews but I went for it since this was the only one I could find in my size. My waist is 44 but I did order 46. The material is very nice and yes there is a smell to it but what would you expect from latex ?! Can't wait to start wearing it :)  I've been wearing this everyday since I got it and it's very comfortable. It was a little difficult putting on the first time but the second time was ALOT easier :) great product !! Worth the money 👍
B00FGA7J76|5|Company is great. Product is exactly as what was described.
B00DOI3RRS|2|I've had to re-sew the lace to the straps on both sides.  Also, I normally wear an extra-small, but I got a small on this and it's too tight to wear without a cardigan or blouse over it.  It's cheap because it's, well, cheap.
B008L51VOU|3|Way small....
B00D3H0F98|4|Runs very large. White runs large. Black runs normal size. Black can run two sizes smaller. Each color different size.
B0035R348K|3|The belly band is way too small. I am a 2-4 size and this one is so tiny. I could still fit in it but I am not sure I will be able to wear it whan I get bigger (now week 16). Another surprize - is is not 100% cotton!!! This was the reason I ordered it, but the tag on the belt says that it made od polyamide and elastane.
B001GCUHD6|5|This bra is very comfortable. I love that it has good support without an under wire. I like the nice this straps it has that really ass to the support. The push up is not over the top and gives just the right amount of lift. Its nice and soft and smooth and is flattering under a T-shirt. I am a C cup and this bra is great, my favorite that I own, I will be buying more from this brand!
B00EZ6WE8Q|5|This fits great and very soft. Will be ordering more :)
B005H25J3O|2|I bought one size up (usually a small, I bought a medium). I wish I bought a L or even an XL! The shirt would have been cute though.
B00T7Z9KUA|5|A++++
B00WG350DG|5|Very pleased with my dress,  fits me very well, thanks to the measurements they provide
B008Y0RU7O|5|I really like this wallet. It holds a plethora of plastic cards in one zipper section and bills and coins in another zippered section. I like the blue exterior. It has a tan fabric lining.
B0095N95MM|5|Perfect for my madsage practice. Lightweight but preserves modesty. Fits men and women comfortably. It's just right!
B000TGWFNK|4|i like it
B00K5KQQ3A|1|Poor quality - coming apart at seams after one wear and no wash.  This is the third clothing item in a few weeks to come apart at the seams after only a few wears.  Amazon's clothing quality is apparently deteriorating and we question whether we will order from them anymore.
B006ICS70O|5|This hoodie fits me perfectly like custom made clothes. The material is thinner than most other brands but it is made from mostly cotton so it insulates well. I'm about 170 pounds 6.2 feet in height and i bought a medium.
B000A2KCOM|5|These are my favorite swamp stompin' pants. Very durable ripstop is stiff but thin enough to move around. These ARE high waisted pants and work well when worn at the proper height, if you prefer to wear below your waist the crotch will be fairly low hanging. Overall great trousers for work or play in tough environments. these are nice and baggy, but I ordered a few sizes up to give myself extra space to move and that worked out nicely.
B00TD06OE4|5|This is my nerd shirt that I bought for 3/14/15. Everybody had a nice comment about it.
B00MGR87M8|5|good quality. Myteenage nieces just loved them!
B001CRR0E4|5|cool costume
B001UQ3XAM|5|I don't know why the complaints because these are the best thermals I have found.  They are super soft and just warm enough.  The sizing is pretty right on and may  even run a little large. They wash beautifully.  We live on the coast so year-round warmth is a necessity. These fit the bill. I ordered a pair a few weeks ago and just ordered another. Plus,  the colors are very pastel and very pretty.  I tossed my other waffle type thermals and am only using these.  I love them!
B00EA82MV8|5|Ordered by accident, but kept it due to good construction and my granddaughter would not turn loose of it!
B00CBFXPM2|4|They are good for a gym workout, wicking away sweat.  They are a bit large, so avoid pulling them on too hard and they will fit fine.
B00WJVGOSU|5|Fits perfect! So girly!
B00H2055MY|5|Beautiful gift for a special friend.  High quality; good colours
B007IDFV9M|5|They were out of the size I needed so I ordered a size bigger. Unfortunately it didn't work out, but it was a nice shirt. The company's customer service was great and the return was made very easy!
B00BOEB6JK|5|Fantastic.  Fit is exactly as expected, flexible, very comfortable.  Only minor issue is the waistband is very deep and tends to hold heat more than the rest of the shorts. Not for Bikram.
B006JQ4LKO|5|This dress arrived quickly and beautifully packaged.  It fits my 13 year old daughter perfectly and has just enough sparkle and enough coverage to make it age-appropriate.  It was perfect for her winter formal and very reasonably priced.
B00XVXLY0S|5|Love this bathing suit. Its a winner. Every one at the beach ask me where i got it from.
B000V6R416|1|This item is very cute but the sizing is so far off even at a large it's sized like a small!!
B00IG1YZBA|5|Great quality as expected from Grey's Anatomy.<br />I am athletic built and usually wear medium slim fit (sometimes large if a shirt doesn't fit in shoulders as I have a lot of muscle) . I got a medium scrub top and it sits perfect; seems like it was custom made for me. Very happy. Please note, if you have a big stomach then go for a size larger as the top is fitted and does not stretch
B00846IRV6|5|Super adorable and perfect for the toddler on the house!!
B00CHS7VLE|5|This dress can be dressed up or down. It's super comfortable so you can wear it any day of the week. It's cute with a colored cardigan.
B00E9Y6AIY|5|Awesome!
B00EBGRILI|4|I like the style.  Since I have received it, I quickly put it to use this past week.  I works well for sun protection and holds up well under windy conditions.
B00UMT1HA6|4|The one I received is nice, except that the pleats on the front only go a third of the way up the front ending in a bulge in the nipple line. The one in the picture looks like something you can wear to yoga, the one I got definitely does not look like something to wear outside. I still like it, but wish the pleat looked like the sales image.
B00NINVNO8|5|Looks better on me then I thought it would came in the mail fast too
B00JBZ425Y|3|The fabric is thinner than expected but product is good otherwise.
B0078U5WGC|5|These are really cute. Don't look like leather, but are nice for the price. I'm 5'6&#34; 125 and don't like really tight fitting so purchased the large and they fit as I expected. Washed inside out in machine on gentle, and dried a few minutes on no heat in the dryer, and it worked out fine.
B00KDO2TCK|4|I love it!
B00594TUMG|4|Comfotable
B002OUNCDG|3|It's ok the size is not as advertised the balls are way smaller than shown it looks somewhat odd, won't waste my time to send it back.
B002G9UGT8|5|My son has owned several of these hats and always requests these for Christmas. The hat must be black and have a visor. He says they keep his head very warm. I like that they don't cost much and the quality seems to be very good. I'll continue to purchase Carhartt products for the men in my life.
B000LXD9N6|5|12 below temps skiing. Used toe warmers in our boots, but we were perfect allllll day with these socks. Didn't even wash them for the next day and used again :)
B00ABAYIVQ|5|Beautiful
B00KOLVGLC|5|This sweater is simple yet elegant. Fits perfectly and is very stylish. The pockets are a great asset!
B00E4H6FHW|5|No longer running around my garden free spirited.
B000PBHCLO|1|I think it amusing, that I have been asked to rate a pair of shorts I have yet to see,if and when I ever get them delivered I'll be happy to write a review for you until then I'll just refer to them as my Ghost shorts for I have yet To see them.
B00IT5QOL2|3|I generally wear a size small, this fits more like an extra small but is still comfortable. The mint color is really pretty. My only complaint is that it's about 5 inches too short and looks like a high water dress.
B003L74ZV4|5|Should work well as I gain or lose weight.
B0071AXLKI|5|AWSOME looking belt all natural feel!  A bit streatchy but it's the coolest belt I have.  I actually gave my first one bought away after having it for 2 days to my DAD who is in his 60's cause he loved it sooooo much.  So I had to buy me another one.  Has held up and well worth the money!
B008DMUC46|5|Have had and been wearing for over a year, and they still wash and fit as they did when I first bought them.
B00FE02GFS|4|Love these. Nice material that looks like pants so that you feel like you are wearing leggings but can get away with wearing them to work with a blazer or tunic. Outside of work, the high waist is great for some fly, sexy looks.  The cut really flatters my curvy figure (size 10).  Love the &#34;gray&#34; color which is more of a taupe/beige with hints of brown and purple.  I want to see this pant in black, denim, and more colors/fabrics!<br /><br />The pants are well constructed, but I wish that there was not a seam in the middle of the front torso panel. Also the top seam does not lie perfectly flat, so I feel like I need a belt or something to cover the top. However, belts take away from the lovely high waisted silhouette. Slightly better construction would raise my rating to 5 stars.  I still recommend this pant.
B000LMO1IE|5|Bought this to go with a tuxedo.  I love the red color.  The size of the square is perfect to fold anyway you want it to fit your pocket in your suit coat.  Very happy with my purchase.
B008UGB6L8|1|Material looks and feels cheap, not what I expected.
B006C9D3HU|5|Great quality shirt. And, quick shipping.
B004OWN1EC|1|Very disappointed in this shirt. Was very excited because it is my favorite color but as soon as I opened the box I clearly saw a visible stain on the shirt. It looks like some type of rust stain. I can't machine it wasn't visible to whoever packed the box. I am going to try using stain remover and see if that helps. Just doesn't seem worth the hassle of sending it back when it was only $8. Thankfully the rest of my order was fine.
B00H4TS0IY|3|The dress is nice, the silver lace in the middle looks a little cheap. The bottom part is beatiful. I wore it for a wedding and I got thons of complements. It did run big. The upper part is also nice. Its a comfortable dress oveall. This ships from China so be careful if you need it fast.
B00YY0CQUY|5|I love this dress. Very nice fit, comfortable against my skin. I love it. Thanks!!
B00I03ELRM|5|I bought this even though my baby is not yet 3mths, because turtles are my fav animal...I LOVE IT. The turtle applique is too gorgeous! the materials are great quality and the colors are pretty. I cant wait for her to be big enough to wear it.
B000783XQS|1|Way to short for a tall person (6'-3&#34;).<br />Threads pulled right away, too, so now it looks terrible and too small.
B00T838N8Q|2|It takes about 20 minutes to get on...and it rolls at the top, that hurts....a lot. Wish I could send this piece of garbage back.
B008LY0MW8|2|I ordered some four way stretch scrubs a couple months ago - size medium - the size I usually wear in various scrubs. The mediums were very snug to say the least. So this time I decided to order a size large and a couple pairs of size large Wonder Wink Romeo scrubs. The Romeos fit great, the four way stretch were incredibly baggy. So I'm stuck with two sets of expensive scrubs that both fit terribly.
B0027IRG8M|5|The hat was exactly as expected from the product picture. Since we received the hat when our daughter was just over 3 months old, she has been able to wear it with the drawstring fairly tightly pulled.  Now she is 6 months old and there is still plenty of room for the drawstring to be expanded (she is about 40th percentile in head circumference).  I would guess we'll get at least three more months of wear out of it easily.
B003OQTQ3O|5|I bought this for my boyfried who goes through wallets every 4 months and he loved it! The stiching is very heavy and has stood up to the massive amount of 'stuff' he keeps in his wallet. The material is soft but durable and is showing minimal wear and tear. So far it is out lasting any of his others.
B00QIW6C10|3|Good quality for price
B005GV9E3C|4|I was waiting to see what would happen when I purchased these. Usually leggings are either too tight, too short, bundles at the knee.  They fit perfectly and would recommend them to all women that wear 1x and medium height.
B009153DX6|5|http://i.imgur.com/a5s24h3.jpg<br />Fits Perfect! Very soft, does get a little hot after a while, I would recommend wearing something underneath if you are going to take this outside your home. AWESOME PRODUCT WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B0016GH1EK|5|Great tank.
B0006U1GES|5|Very comfortable; good support
B008OB4LHU|5|Received order within a couple days of placing order. Super cute and exactly what the picture looked like. No complaints
B00928XTRC|1|This is the most horrendous thing I have ever seen since I saw a real dog dragged behind a truck and skinned. This encourages violence against animals. What were you people thinking? Get it off your site, please.
B008LXLXXG|5|Well, it actually did briefly.  He wore it to school, saying he lost a bet and had to wear it.<br /><br />But I can tell he likes it.
B000VRC5YG|2|I did not have the frayed edges issue as the previous reviewer, but I was expecting a more substantial product for the cost (I even ordered it when it was a Gold Box Offer).  I could have gotten a better scarf at a lower cost locally.  The high cost of this scarf may be due to the fact that the product is imported from Germany.  I will still give this as a Xmas gift to my grandmother.  More of a stocking stuffer than a gift at this point.    Would I recommend this to others?  Unfortunately, No.
B004EY17BO|5|Delivered on time - no problems. sizing and product as described by seller. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the craftmansship to this turtleneck sweater. It has an excellent shape and the colors are as described. Not to mention the prize. I like it and will be warm and stylish this autumn/winter.
B00KJDPFT4|3|The problem with these outfits is that the hat is very small. The onesie is a fair size. However, the pants are very big. They are also very loose. I used them as long shorts for a good while after my baby outgrew the onesie. However, the hat never fit even though I tried stretching it a great deal.
B00PM72YOQ|5|Great bra, very comfortable and the high sides do help control pudge.
B00FHRYVN8|4|Color and size (small) were perfect for my daughter in law.  She loved it!
B00O62X70I|5|all perfect
B002GHC2VU|5|My son usually wears size XL in jacket or sweatshirts.  However, the XL Carhartt jacket I originally ordered was too large in shoulders, too long in sleeves.  Returned and ordered Large, fits perfect.  So, jackets do run a little large.
B000LPM4IA|5|These inserts have been a life saver. My 1 year old can really soak a diaper! These have saved the day over and over again. I need more.
B0072QWP3K|2|From the picture you see a white shirt semi-see thru. What you actually get is a grey opaque shirt that is not see thru at all! Order from the cheaper venders for this shirt because you will get exactly the shirt they are describing. I bought this one for a few extra dollars because it was white and see thru.
B00W8YCSR4|3|This dress was really pretty but the top was a little big on me. I would probably get a smaller size.
B0038QOCRK|5|Great product bought these for the woman and she loves them and will be buying more very soon again they are very comfy she says.
B007ULRIH0|4|Got this for a futuristic costume party. Very flattering, I normally fit into a medium but ordered a size up and it fit perfectly.
B00239CTVE|5|Very please with the quality of the item.
B0042GSAEQ|4|Super cute. Nice material. Worth $10 though.....? After a hit the &#34;complete order&#34; button I kind of regretted spend that much on one pair of socks.
B005V07DRC|4|I thank all of the prior reviewers who cautioned that the shirt is not true to ordinary sizing.  I used those reviews to adjust the size when I placed my order and it worked perfectly.  I like the shirt.  The material is light and allows for movement without restraint or bulk.  The sleeves strike just above my elbows which gives the appearance that it is a bit large.  The neck is a high enough cut that it provides sun protection for the neck but it is also loose.  I feel good about wearing clothing in the unforgiving hot sun that gives skin protection.  Well worth the bucks.
B00KWMJ8SG|5|It's hard purchasing clothing without seeing it or trying it on. However, this is true to fit, true to quality and a great bargain to boot! Going to order a few more for my busy husband.
B0009WONN4|5|I just received my leather business card wallet. I have noticed so far the quality of the leather and the stitching looks flawless. Thank You for such a fine wallet.
B00C5UVZS4|5|Though it fits too tight and is more real M than L, the quality is good, it is lightweight, very cute and bright color, with 2 inside hidden pockets. I love it!
B006RJWQX2|2|Had these before with no issues. Feels like two different sizes, on glove busted seams within only a few weeks of very minor use.
B007P04IU6|5|Great fit, length, color and style.  You'll love these pants.  I wish they came in different colors.  I'd buy one in each color.
B00IAMXWSM|3|The shirt fits fine around the middle, but if you like a shirt you can tuck in, this is too short!  Half shirts were out of style after the Eighties.
B00JK6H1IE|4|Nice material, lighter weight for the desert. Fits a little tight in the shoulders, I wouldn't call it XL. Washes up nicely.
B008LXYSFQ|5|Grandson loves his new swim trunks and will be spending lots of time in the water over the summer months.
B00F98TVTY|5|These socks really protect your feet. They're comfortable and wear well.
B00Y1CTNHE|5|This dress was exactly what I expected. It's thin, but not too see through. I did have to wear a white cami underneath because you could somewhat see my bra through it. It was exactly what I was looking for.
B0050JGE5G|5|Comfortable, Comfortable, Comfortable. Looks sporty, looks flattering, and the pockets are functional.
B00YD9KGNA|3|Love the item I ordered as the color is bright and beautiful.  The pair I got is not at all the same. The red is pink and the blue is very light blue. :(
B0046RRTTI|4|I bought this for my Halloween costume, I'm a woman.  It barely fits around my hips, I'm a size 6. But it works and looks nice.
B005KOJ3OK|5|I purchased these socks because they were Gold Toe and I am not disapointed at all they are very soft and warm.
B00DQZ4Y0S|4|Very comfortable, fit well, and stylish.
B003ES593I|5|Great sports bra...best I've found.
B00TZ9LI08|4|A little short but colors as shown and good material. Not see through
B00S4G08T0|5|Excellent fabric, finished good measure, is ideal for office work or casual clothing, hurt does not come in more colors, but those had bought all, except white, too and easy get dirty.
B00KOGL60S|5|I love it. Fits great. arrived on time. Perfect. Thanks!
B00AARK0US|4|Lots of pockets.... I got 4 pairs. The only reason why I did not give it a five star one of the pants I got was a returned one and whoever returned it made the elastic so loose. Should have not been sold again.....makes me leery on getting more. I hate returning stuff...
B00GKCA084|5|I was a little concerned about ordering board shorts online but they fit great!
B00BPFB47M|3|This material, but good for price
B00G426L38|3|When I ordered this scarf &#34;Wool&#34; was in the title and description. It is 100% acrylic. While warm, I was expecting a wool garment. I don't smell anything weird on it, and yes it did come straight from china.
B00O7K7XTU|1|was listed as XXL, and it fit like a medium
B00B785QCQ|5|Cool hat I am glad I bought this!
B002K6F7AA|3|I'm barely a 34B. I was pretty much an A cup before pregnancy and this bra in size M barely fits. The grey was larger than the black.  On top of it all... there was about a 1-inch part of the bottom seam unsewn on the black bra.  I just sewed it up by hand. I'm only keeping it because i tried on the grey first and was OK with it and ripped all the tags off. So be sure to inspect the bra first!
B000ZQ667A|5|I LOVE this mask. Bought it as part of my halloween costume like most others but I find myself wearing this just for fun. Mind you I am a 25 year old female but still I find any and every reason to wear this. It's good quality but for the price I would say it is GREAT. Have absolutely no regrets toward this purchase.
B00JR5C156|5|Love this cover up, just what I was looking for on my Jamaica trip.
B00HOS90IY|1|You should be ashamed of this price!  So many little girls can't have anything frozen because of greedy selfish people
B00K890T7M|5|Excelente
B00LW4QQ1A|5|My son loves the Planes fire and rescue movie and these were a big hit! The flannel material is super cozy and has held up to many washes already, and to a 6 year old, apparently, the action scene on the top does not disappoint :). I wish I had bought two pair!
B0026JPV3E|5|Finally found my 70s workout shorts and love em.  They are not as short as Dolphins if you guys remember them.  I have a 32 inch inseam and don't have to worry about my equipment being exposed if I just wear bikini underwear. I got a MED and it fits perfectly. Forget it if you wear boxers.
B00E5RPDMY|4|It does have a lot of stretch, so maybe it's meant to be more fitted - I don't know. In anycase, of all of my son's thermal-type shirts, I like the look and feel of this one the best. It has a softer feel and it thinner, but not flimsy. it is a good quality shirt and my son enjoys wearing it. I think that the density of the weave makes it warmer than the typical cotton thermals, but my son is always warm so I can't say for sure. I would buy him another and I think he'd like that.
B00IN0UKHW|5|Item arrived quickly and is very nice
B00C9V23BC|5|Great value! Great quality
B00FBD2G0I|5|yeah socks!
B00GBAHFP6|4|clear printing and shows well. Black color is deep black. Sizing seems to be about the average of other tees
B00BTNP8VI|4|Medium weight 100 % cotton tagless t-shirt.<br />Unknown amount of shrinkage after wash as this was given as a gift.
B009SRM5XG|5|Just bought this nice puffer jacket, it looks adorable on me and is extra warm and comfortable. With its perfect fit I can't imagine anything better. I would highly recommend it.
B00BQZ3IPW|5|This is a great shirt for my husband, he is a Chevelle owner. It was a great fit and quality of shirt was better than expected. Made my husband happy.
B00KIZ452Q|4|Nice graphics. I like heavy weight t-shirts and this one is your basic tee. Overall a good value.
B00VSE53MM|3|I bought these to wear under Blazers for work and they are perfect for that. I thought they fit a little looser but they still work
B000PQKVD0|4|Ordered hat as a gift for teenage son.  He loves it.  It has a nice weight, neat/tight knit. Many compliments.  He has worn it during tough NJ outdoor winter workouts.
B00OM8UDVC|4|Fits as it should. A great product for a marginal price, this would be five stars if I hadn't received one with stitching coming undone, but considering I got 5 excellent pairs of drawers I'm content.
B0040VYELQ|5|For the price you probably can't find a better hat.  I got this for my wife after my mother recommended it, as she owns one and has gotten a lot of use out of it.  The hat is soft and you can flip the brim up or down, it comes with a neck strap which may be hard to see in the default photo.  She uses it for gardening and it's light and cool and helps block the sun.  It seems to be well made.
B007M853ZU|1|I only wore this sweater once and it now has a hole in the middle. It is very fragile and I don't know how it happened but for the price it should have lasted longer than one wear!
B0091KCAM6|4|These pants look just like the picture.  cool!
B00DRMP51M|5|Great bra, really comfy, good to hold up the girls, and very cute! Would absolutely recommend! Also has a slot for padding, but I haven't used those, will update if need be!
B00IXX5J3O|5|it fits me good, i like it very much.
B0021WK93S|4|I have unsightly veins and wanted more coverage for lap swimming.  These fit the bill.  The only thing I didn't like is the crotch is too long.
B003CIUWYQ|3|Good costume for any costume party occasion.<br />Very colorful and put together very well for future<br />use again and again.
B005SW8BQA|5|Great Dickies quality as usual
B001VNTUUQ|4|Loved color and feel.  One was not color ordered but evidentially out of it. Substitute was OK.  Good color coordinate
B00H4L44SM|5|Quick!
B009L1QBE8|5|Amazing quick dry material, great side pocket, great fit! Fit over knee which I love the longer board short! Shipping was 3 days for ground as it shipped the day I ordered.
B003CU4DM6|5|The costume is very apeeling.
B004DNVPKY|4|Excellent  value for the price.  I would buy again if the color selection was greater.
B005Q8UQ96|5|Fit perfect!! Not two pieces!!  It's just like a morphsuit but way better price!!
B007UO4618|5|He does like the hat, but it is a little tight, but that doesn't stop him from wearing it. He loves it :) But anyone with a bigger head shouldn't get this lol.
B00LUQ27JU|2|I purchased this dress for my granddaughter for a Valentines Gift, I ordered a size 14-16, she's a 14, however the dress was sized more like a 8 or 10.  It was not worth returning, I'll gift it to my niece who is an actual size 8!
B005MDSEQ2|5|Great quality and nice looking. Affordable price
B003TLUIZO|5|Good!
B004P5A89Y|1|This is the most god awful excuse for a dress. I knew it was going to be &#34;costume&#34; material but everything about this outfit is wrong. I tried steaming the tutu and it didn't make a difference. The fabric looks like its about to fall apart at any point while wearing it. The seams aren't straight so the tutu is janky and uneven. It looks like someone had it stuffed in a drawer for the past few years. The color is off and it looks NOTHING like the picture. Absolutely HORRIBLE!
B0088YPR5S|5|I was worried that this coat wouldn't be warm enough for winter, but I was wrong. It is great; it keeps me warm, and I get tons of compliments on the style. A lot of people didn't even know Carhartt made &#34;pretty&#34; clothes, so it's great. The fit is nice, and I like the length. It's not too short but not too long. A great coat all around.
B00FDHIU2A|2|These leggings are very thin and can not be worn alone. I should have returned them but did't get around to it. The color is great but they are see through!
B00CKIMRBU|5|. Got this for my grand daughter going to college in North .  It snows there.  She said it was warm !!!
B0085C7X5A|3|This looks so cute online -- and it is.  However, it's REALLY tiny.  Probably would work well for a 12 year old girl.  Also, some sequins were falling off when I took it out of the package.
B00HK50EQI|4|They fit me like I excepted them to fit. Just a little snug around the thighs.<br />But a little stretching should help.
B004IYBYEU|5|Awesome product
B002VBODDQ|5|I got this TravelSafe 12L and the smaller TravelSafe 100 for an upcoming trip. They're both built really well and seem very sturdy. The 12L can hold my 15.4\\" Toshiba and her 10.1\\" Acer. I highly recommend this for extra peace of mind.
B0012XXAAQ|5|I bought this bra for the first time at JC Penny. I fell in love with its quality and support. Now after 1 year I decided to order it over amazon as JCPenny is a long drive away for me. I am glad i ordered it. Nothing's changed in the quality of the product and I am pleased to say that Playtex has maintained its quality. I highly recommend this bra.
B000IBH7IY|5|This is just a great product.............has been for years.  The bibs with zip to hip have been my husbands all time favorite. Carhartt offers a product with durability and warmth.
B003JH8T4U|2|The wig want as the picture shown. I had it out the package for a few days so it can take proper shape. And when I tried it on it wasn't what I expected. The hair didn't lay right and the bangs where un even.
B00L49X7EC|5|The price is a bargain, cardigan is very well made, details are impeccable, looks high end. Very lovely!
B00BIGXBOM|5|These bras fit perfectly and are very comfortable. I am a little finicky but Lily of France bras are the best fit for me.
B00GPPP92S|2|I Did not like the foam bra. It gave me a weird shape  maybe it would be better for someone with a smaller chest.
B003O0N0NM|5|I'm hard-to-fit in clothing, as I am a bigger guy who is just under average height.  I've found Columbia Ultimate Roc pants to be perfect for me, as they are true-to-size.  They are durable (I've run them through the washer and dryer dozens of times - almost no fraying), stain-resistant, roomy, and made of \\"breathable\\" fabric.  I just ordered two more pairs to go with the four I already own.<br /><br />Be sure to buy the \\"Ultimate Roc\\" pants, as they are a slightly different cut and fabric from Columbia's ordinary \\"Roc\\" pants.
B0009GG7NY|3|Color and delivery of product were as expected.  The size however is a bit small considering I ordered 3XL size to make sure of a comfortable fit.
B00J8TBR2O|4|The Jag Women's Lucy Low Rise Slim Leg Jean, size 12, fit very well.  I'm 5' 5&#34; tall, and they are about 1/1/2 &#34; to 2&#34; too long even with a 1 1/2&#34; heel, so I will need to hem them, but otherwise they are nice looking and comfortable.  The picture is true,  and the material is good, sale price great, and they washed well.  The only reason I give them a 4 star instead of a 5 is that I wish they had the &#34;short, medium, and tall&#34; lengths.
B00974BCGQ|5|I have such a difficult time finding a bra that is comfortable all day and is nice looking. This bra is perfect for me.
B006R77378|5|We read a tip on-line about using this tape to keep cochlear implants in place.  Our daughter is bilaterally implanted.  We use this product everyday.  The tape holds and doesn't irritate her skin at all.
B004BDP0WU|5|this dress is so cute...fits perfect and very different  from what I have.. plan to wear it to a wedding this summer  and then my daughter wants to borrow it and wear to a   wedding in late summer...Attractive  to all age groups.
B00HF9WI6S|1|THIS IS NOT A MATERNITY BATHING SUIT!. the tank portion only covers half of my belly and the bra portion covers very little.  The bottoms are way too high for maternity belly and uncomfortable. Do not buy it.
B00B1AEGDK|3|It's a little small but I like it.
B00HESUF9M|5|Luv dem
B00GUDB7B2|5|I purchases XL which fits me very well as I am 184 cm, 118 Kg, the material is excellent and the finishing is excellent, Thanks Van Heusen, Thanks Amazon.
B00FKOYSH2|5|Donning this magnificent specimen of Patriotism, I could feel the freedom coursing through my veins like an intravenous injection of the latest street drugs. I wore this bandana non-stop over the 4th of July weekend through various environments and all the PINKO COMMIE attempts of removal (bad weather, sweating, and swimming in the ocean) could not get this shining beacon of freedom off my head, nor did any of the aforementioned Commie removal plots lead to the dye staining my freedom-soaked skin.  10/10 would wear again.
B00EVLVL5C|5|Excellent for working out or tanning in.  These items wash without shrinking and they are so comfortable to wear all the time.
B0051712UO|5|we love them
B006PD5YSO|5|Satisfied with the quality of the pants, are pretty good, and are just as sought. I recommend it :D !
B000ZHGBU6|5|Stockings that stay up all day. Wonderful.
B0038M1XN0|5|Not quite up to par with what the rich snobs at the dance school can afford, but it's a nice bag and has a place for everything.
B00AARHIKI|5|perfect..
B00A608IVW|4|. . .
B002OSSNAU|3|ok
B0041941P6|5|Before ordering this skirt, I worried that the material would be too light to be work-appropriate.  However, the material is nice and heavy, not see-through at all.  The skirt is a nice length for the office.  It's now one of my favorite pieces for a normal work day.  I bought this in grey and will probably buy it again in another color.
B008P4F6GG|3|Quality was good, V-Neck too low for me.
B00B89NIG0|4|This is going to be my wedding dress in the fall and I'm very pleased with my purchase! The fabric is lightweight and breathable, Even though the white is definitley see-through. Nothing a slip can't fix! The little belt is thin as paper.
B00FFVVAXU|2|cute but small
B00KXCVLIK|4|Be very aware of the Asia to US conversion, but otherwise are exactly as advertised. I'd buy them again.
B00TWIQZ00|1|I really liked this skirt, the colors and quality were what I expected. However, the skirt was so small I gave it to my 12 year old niece. The sizing was way off and fit like a size much smaller than desribed.
B00DH2I4CY|4|It's ok, I would have love it more if it's long sleeve, I never like the short sleeve type, and I did not like the look of the short sleeve after trying it on. The material is very soft and comfy though. I'm a 32DDD, 28&#34; waist, and the Small fits really well. A lot of reviewers were right. You should order size down because it runs large. If I gotten my usual Medium size, it would be too baggy. But I've always gotten a size small in women's sizing anyway because it's always too large on me.
B00ENZ63LS|4|As someone that has a uses this binder daily, I would just like to state that it is in fact a good binder. I have a 36 C chest, and this binder results in a nearly flat chest (in a large on the smallest clasp). It's a steal for the price, and I highly recommend this product to anyone with a small budget.<br />As for size-<br />As it says, order a few sizes bigger than your clothes would be. I am five foot six and usually wear a small to medium in shirts and tanks, however when I measured myself I was a large in this. I don't regret the choice to just go with the size provided, and neither with you.<br />Coverage and compression-<br />As I said, I am almost totally flat as a 36 C in bras, and that's not a small feat. I do recommend that you smoosh your breasts downward  when you get this thing on though... otherwise you have an awkward bulgy uni-pec. &#60;shivers&#62;<br />This binder does cover everything though, and this could be a good or bad thing. Wearing a low cut shirt (like a tee shirt with a bit of give around the collar) is a no no. Baggy graphic tees are great though and I can wear a suit with it. ^-^<br />Construction-<br />A compression binder combined with a tank top is a freaking miracle,  my friends. I no longer have to layer in the summer, or wear what may as well be three shirts for a layered look. The binder itself is only connected by the straps around the shoulders, and because of this the hooks on the binding peice can get caught on the inside of the shirt. For those worried, there are stretchy panels on the side opposite the claps, and breathing is easy in this (even when exercising and singing!). HOWEVER the eyelets on this product can pull from the fabric and break off (hence why I'm here to order a new one -_-') but this typically happens after several months of continuous wear on the smallest setting. I don't know around other clasps, as I have never worn the binder on a larger setting.<br />I guess that's all I have to say for now. Bind safe my friends, spend the money on this or a better brand. Don't Bind with tape or ace bandages PLEASE.<br />-Michael
B00JWPZVA8|4|I really like this skirt and wear it often both to church in a dressy fashion with a nice blouse and heels, as well as casually in a T-shirt and flats.  The embroidery is well done and the quality seems high.  There are no loose stitches (and I've worn this skirt quite often, including a couple walks through the woods and sitting on a log around a bonfire).  The quality is excellent for the price, the design is flattering, the length is perfect for me.  If it weren't for one thing I'd give it 5-stars.  That one thing is that the design is only on the front, the back is plain and unflattering.  With a skirt this high in quality, why couldn't they make the back more appealing?  People do see me coming and going, from the back and front.  Also, the material on the back seems thinner than the front.  The front is opaque but I think you can seen through the back if I stand in strong light so I do wear a slip under it.  I'd highly recommend this skirt if it weren't for that fact.  As it is, I'lll say I really like the skirt, wear it often, it's of high quality but make sure you look at the pictures of the back of the skirt before making the decision to purchase it.
B00SMHYY3W|3|Seemed much smaller then a 26
B000YD89KQ|4|This is a great quality shirt with nice pattern and material.  If the cutter can make all cuts as with this one, then Quicksilver would have a good thing.
B00RT47X82|3|Busy  won't button up. Material very cheap and see threw. As expected spending $12. Pretty idea though.
B00EUFEO2G|3|Picks up lint and cat hairs--not the material I expected.
B00MIBEB9U|5|good product
B00HNKYN6W|5|Love the outfit ,great quality and comfort,toddler really liked it.
B0072DESOM|4|Mine is ~1.5cm thick with 9 cards shoved into it along with some bills.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Accommodates everything without excessive bulk<br />- Four card slots is sufficient for most needs<br />- ID slot integrated into right panel; no extra layer<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Paper currency slot is separated into two; I rather just have one slot to further reduce the thickness.
B0078Z0TAQ|5|this fits my daughter just fine in the waist and she is a size 4 - 6 junior and it is not scratchy.
B00M0W3L20|5|Super cute, my son loves it!
B00MXV841G|5|Love my shirt
B00UGGV8EK|5|Great material, and true to size.
B00718QE0E|5|Perfect lightweight shirt
B003D10IO6|5|I love this shirt. Got good laughs.
B008A759X8|1|WASN'T IMPRESSED
B001BZAC60|4|Good shirt, nice fabric. Wrinkles a bit but it is easy to get the wrinkles out.
B000SKNYB4|1|Not made of cotton and my feet gets to hot and sweaty really fast.
B00C0PESK6|4|she liked the jacket and did not like the skirt as much so made her own skirt.  She looked great!
B005O0V2IA|5|Look and feel great!  Super soft and ciel blue is vibrant in color and even has a little sheen to the fabric.
B00BPJOF1A|5|Very comfortable, looks great. Especially good for those of us who lost hair through chemo. Venting holes allow air to circulate helping hair to re grow. Bought all available colors. Awesome!
B011QP5BVA|5|It didn't fit
B003ETYOQU|5|Pretty much as above. This is a reasonably attractive hat that's crushable and cool. I've posted a picture. I don't feel my head is abnormally large at six feet and change, but I did require an XL with this model.<br /><br />A small piece of stitching started to unwind on the very top with mine, though it doesn't affect the hat structurally. The brim is also a little floppy in winds over about 15 MPH. This is my traveling hat. At home for yard work, I'm likely to use a straw-style hat with an even wider brim.
B00D1D4GGW|5|Im looking forward to wearing this shirt at work.
B00CMDWUIS|5|Fit nicely, feel good, fun to wear.  Recommend.
B00007JTZ7|5|I was introduced to Ear Grips over two years ago.  Working outside for a school at least 45 minutes a day in Iowa meant some bone-chilling days, and then you have to go in and face people with hat-hair...but not with Ear Grips.  They ride low behind your head, and really keep your ears warm.  Since being introduced to them, I have spread them to two other family members and several co-workers.  Seldom do products deliver so well on what they are supposed to do...but this product really does.
B00VXDT99G|5|Grandpa loved this! Great Father's Day surprise.
B00F652ZCU|1|This wig is weird. The back is supposed to look teased up into a buffot (sp?) but it is huge and makes your head look deformed
B0044JGW4G|5|Loved the picture on the t-shirt, had a very awesome design that I am very proud to wear.  Couldn't really ask for more.
B0036QIRSC|4|I purchased this to wear under skirts during very long, humid southern summers. It prevents chafing beautifully and keeps things smooth like a slip. The waist band is a little snug for anyone who is not hour-glass shaped but not as bad as control-top pantyhose. The \\"lo-rise\\" description rather overstates things. I supposed the rise is not long, but in an era of super low-rise jeans I cannot call this truly low-rise.
B00BWZF4TY|5|JUST ORDERED ONE MORE..
B005OFLT8I|4|perfect for our son
B00H4MYP7Q|5|perfect fit and super comfy. I am constantly getting compliments on this hoodie. One of my favorite hoodies now as well. :D
B00CDY4ARA|5|I love these jeans. After two babies I really appreciate the waistband and comfort of these, both for work and when chasing kiddos around.<br /><br />The fit is slightly on the small side and they do tend to shrink a little. I usually wear a 6 but was more comfortable in the 8 for this cut.
B00P7AIFAA|5|I'm a 42D and this bra is comfortable and supportive.
B004ZKT3I6|3|My husband says they are comfortable but they could be a little warmer.
B0045D98L0|5|The costume fit well and was everything I expected in a costume. Unfortunately the weather was terrible for a baby to trick or treat.
B00N2ZF70S|5|Works really well. One of the best sports bras I've bought and I'm a 36g
B00CTUWHNC|1|Plastic boned and sized wrong.
B00485F9ZO|3|I love Fantasie bras...however this one fits differently. Instead of a high round look like the other bras...this one gives more of a downward slop...very pretty bra...just not very flattering...
B00GBT8QM8|5|Adorable!
B00412B0CU|4|It's made very well but is a little large. Normally I'm a 34D but what can I say, I'm a sucker when its on sale. Of course my size wasn't an option. I can still wear it but I it would be perfect if it was a little tighter fitting.
B00HR7XPEM|1|Pretty color....about all i can say for it.  For my tastes it is very hard and unpleasant feeling in the hand.<br />Didn't want to go thru the hassle of returning...so just tossed it.
B000KK0OLA|5|I was very pleased with the fit and softness of the fabric! The waistband was just right and the pockets made this the perfect hang around the house shorts! Going to order another pair!
B00HSC7O2U|1|Very bed purchase. Very pooor quality and very bed smell. I don't recommende it
B00MKB9SPU|5|Great shirt and my mom loves the gift ! Came on time and was happy to see it 💙
B00EHPFQVM|5|Just as other reviewers posted they are snug at first and it is particularly snug getting them over my feet but once on, they fit perfectly. I'm 5'8, 160lbs., and the medium/large was an exact fit. Great for wearing with long sweaters and cardigans as well as tall riding boots.
B006SRTFGY|5|The Duofold thermals fit just right and are very comfortable.
B00OAAKMF4|1|Take it from me: Don't waste your time buying these. First, the ears are made of foam and are very flimsy. Second, when mine arrived in the mail, the rivet was broken and the ear flopped over pathetically. Third, when I tried to contact Brands on Sale, the vendor, I was told that any orders placed between 10/1 - 10/31 were final sale and non-refundable. I understand that policy, but think they should truly make an exception for clearly defective merchandise. After all, they could have snapped the headband in half and shoved it into a box and it still wouldn't be refundable under their policy. In addition, I received a very terse reply from them with no apology. Good thing Amazon has superior customer service and provides the A-Z protection. I received an Amazon credit within minutes of filing my A-Z claim.
B00BB0WUR4|3|This hat must have been made for pumpkin head or frankenstein. It was way too big. One size fits all should not be applied.  The shipping time was far too long too, and I didn't even get to wear it. The seller needs a faster shipping speed. I have never seen it take a week for something to be delivered by UPS!
B00G04NI4K|5|Fits well and is a quality product! Will be buying from them again!
B008KGSAYY|4|A little see-through... but great fitting.  Material could be thicker.  The black version is better. Can't see through it like this one. Still a great shirt though!
B00E5OMGBI|4|Soft and luxurious, inside and out.  I like that they're longer to go under my coat sleeves.  I thought the price was a bit high, and I didn't really need gloves that worked with my devices, so they were hard to find, but they do come in different colors.
B00O0S1N7M|2|Please if you guys are planning to buy this, these skirts are a completely different size! Please check the size charts before you purchase!!!!
B00GKO00RI|4|This tie is beautiful, but I think it's definitely more &#34;dark grey&#34; than black. That's not to say it looks bad, but if you're really determined on having a DARK black tie, you may want to look elsewhere. That said, I'm not sure my picture does it justice either, since the satin finish makes it more reflective, it's really hard to get an idea for the true color.
B007KMT0Y8|5|Purchased two of these for my girls for a fall wedding to match there dresses. My daughters will be almost 7 and 9 and 1/2 before the event. I bought two black extra small ones for them. They are a little long on my 9 year old, and much longer for by almost 7 year oldbut the way the fabric bunches up it looks great on them. Around the shoulders has a bit more fabric giving it a very elegant look. Plus they should be able to wear them for quite a while before they grow out of them. They seem very sturdy too.
B00BPIMU3Q|5|Nice design
B00K8TSHRQ|4|Wish it was a little bigger, but it's very nice. My daughter likes it. Hoping it will last til the end of the school year.
B00OK43RGG|5|Took a long time to get to me, but for the price and look of it it was worth the wait! I'm in love with this tank top and I've already gotten so many compliments!
B00HUS6VOO|4|Very comfortable-- 50/50 mix which is a little misleading to brand them as straight cotton but advertising these days..... These are the longest lasting pairs of panties I have owned. I used to wear Hanes but I wanted something with a smaller waistband. If you are planning on low rise denim products, these would not be the style to buy-- but definitely not granny panties either. I would purchase these again. I own this particular pack of colors, they have not bled on the first wash or subsequent washes.
B008MA4KT2|5|Love them. Have all colors
B000B852HC|5|Wonderfully adaptable jacket. You can use it to dress up or dress down. Tough material, and the zip-out liner is excellent. Jacket should last you at least a decade as it is immune to passing trends and withstands quite a bit of abuse.
B007KFSALO|4|I liked the shirt until I washed it once (cold water, low tumble dry). now it doesn't fit...reminds me of those cheap t's that they sell at Wal-Mart and target.
B008DEV6TO|5|Good
B00FSBNM5Q|4|I really like this sweater do you have a large size, I haven't use it because it's kind of small, how can I exchange it for a larger size? Will you let me know as soon as possible by e-mail it fine or cell is 408 799-8385.
B009PNF5U8|5|Very well made hat. I used to be a flexfit or fitted hat guy. But after awhile the hat out stretches itself. So I'm going back to basics. Is recommend!
B00817DW8Q|5|really nice quality
B001E5Y2Y0|4|Cute outfit for my daughter for 50s day at school. Top definitely runs small and skirt is bigger. But she wears a size 2 and is 5'4\\" and the adult small fit okay. Top a little snug and short if she lifts her arms. We just put a black tank under it to be safe. All in all it was a cute outfit.
B007SGO3DE|5|Looks good, fits right. I wear it at work all the time with my suits.
B00PUXCS8E|4|I like it.. It's cute.. I'll probably buy a medium next time. I bought a large because i was afraid of it fitting small, but I assume a medium will fit like a medium should.
B00EZQ4LXC|4|I use them at night so my daughter doesn't get cold feet but too much for daytime use in Texas.
B0009MM3JA|4|This windbreaker runs a little small and short. Buyers may want to try a tall man's size if they are in the six foot range. Otherwise the material is a good quality and light weight but warm enough.
B00FYIQ6BU|4|i bought the M side ,if  i buy S side that could be good
B00NX50WWU|4|Fits my daughter perfectly. I wanted a little darker pink which is why I chose this dress. The color is way lighter than the picture.
B0009MZV4Y|5|These socks are so well made!  They are very comfortable without being bulky.  They keep my feet cool even in the Phoenix summer and they stand up to twice the laundering of regular socks.
B00ABDGUA0|1|I  bought this set as a gift for my niece and was definitely disappointed when I received it and discovered that it is NOT what is shown in the picture.  The shirt is ONLY gray with no writing/pictures on it, just plain.  The shirt does not say &#34;HORSE GIRL&#34; as shown in the picture.  This picture needs to be taken down so others don't land in the same situation.
B00AHSLWAW|5|Look great and fit great. Nice strechey material that's very comfortable and dries quickly
B001E50CEO|5|im 5 ft and 110 pounds..i bought the xsmall lab coat. it fits good. a little big in the middle when fully buttoned but what lab coat should be skin tight?! none!. the arm length is perfect and the cost hits a little bit above my knees. the coat makes me look stylish and slimming unlike most lab coats. i washed it on hot and dryed it but it didn't seem to shrink that much. over all im very happy with the product!!!
B00BD2BGZM|5|Very happy with product
B0085J8YB0|3|I do not know in detail because the return
B00IQ9UN2M|5|This is a great outfit!<br />The material is so soft and feels wonderful when I wear it.  The fabric stretches and hugs me in all the right places.<br />I love to wear this with my Mary Jane pumps because it makes me feel so sexy!
B00DN13KD2|5|This is ADORABLE!! My grandbaby  looks like a princess in this outfit...ABSOLUTELY PRECIOUS OUTFIT! Nothing better to say about this.
B00AZ6ZLV2|2|ordered a 3xl instead of a 2xl based on other reviews, my husband was &#34;swimming&#34; in the shirt.  I wonder if the 2xl would have been too big.  Fast service and great colors but will have to return the shirts or keep them for turning into beach cover-ups or other crafty ideas
B00K151IBY|4|It's small but still really cute and got to me a lot sooner then I thought it would
B007TMXZTA|5|pretty cool t shirt. fits very nice. would highly recommend buying if you are considering.<br />. . . . . . .
B000MPNDL6|5|This product gives me exactly what I need, posture support. It does not cut into the armpits,(that also happens when you are resisting the pulling back), and it doesn't have the bulk of a traditional posture support. I can wear it discreetly under my clothes, and all day! I am very pleased with this product. Extremely good price, as well.
B0032S1A2E|5|The dress went above and beyond my expectations! I wore it to homecoming last year and I got many compliments throughout the night. I loved it so much I used it as one of my outfits in my senior pictures I took a few weeks ago! It fit well, the color is very vibrant and with the embellishment on the side you'll be sure to stand out in a crowd with this dress on, just like I did. ;)
B00E6DB97K|5|This is a wonderful suit! It's very soft and breathable. I would follow the washing instructions to wash on gentle cycle and hang dry.....
B007JMXKW2|5|I hardly ever write reviews, but I just had to say thanks again for the wonderful customer service. You were so friendly and helpful. I really like these skirts. They're not too rough, but are made to last (made in USA!) and are modest, which is hard to find. They are lovely, especially when I walk, giving an elegant look. People are asking where I got them and I gladly tell. Will order more!
B003O0NPRI|5|This purchase was exactly how purchases should be. I knew the product from buying it at the store before. BUt my size was not available in that store, tried another store, another.. then checked it on line ordered it and was actually cheaper and they arrived quickly with the cheap shipping. I was a little scared that it would not be the same product BUT my fear was put to rest when I opened the box. I am happy, no suprices, except for the pleasant one.
B0083SWH0W|1|These are not true to size, I wear a size 26 or 2 in Silvers and other jeans. These are really 27's and have a 33in inseam instead of the 32in I was expecting. Can't return them because Amazon doesn't include anything to help you return it, and I can't print one out because I use my phone for internet. Never had a problem with a site not including a return label with your order. Guess I'll have to try and sell them on Craigslist. I gave them 1 star because they're cute jeans.
B00BKV7XJO|3|Order at least one size bigger than your normal size.
B00DFLG40Q|1|Hated these.  First, I ordered what is pictured, pajama bottoms with the matching t-shirt style top.  What I received, however, were the pajama bottoms with a matching, long-sleeved pajama top, same pattern as the bottoms.<br />Even if I had gotten what I ordered, I would have returned them most likely; the material is terrible quality.
B00E955EQM|5|I love it
B00A8YZFXU|1|Very cheaply made! I'm a small<br />I like my jackets to be loose and bigger so I got a medium well it's really a small! So I would need a large! For the $ I paid I'm very unsatisfied with this produced.
B008BHEF5A|5|They fit a little more tight through the leg than I expected but this was a pleasant surprise. I was afraid they would look too saggy to wear certain places but the fit makes them appropriate to wear to the office or when I'm going out.
B0002X0QS6|5|Excellent shorts without that thick uncomfortable waistband or tight legs that most shorts have today.  I highly recommend!
B006NWLJ2C|5|These shorts are great! True to fit. Nice length! Wish they came in more then 2 colors. Would definitely order more.
B0078YXFGM|3|Bought this for my husband, the quality was not great, but for a few wears it is fine. Would buy for minimal wear and tare.
B00SKPPDSG|5|For me, it fit perfectly and is so pretty. It's like it was tailored for me! I love this. The colors are prettier in person than the picture. I'm going to look for another one in a different color.
B002GHC3UK|5|Nice shirts ,good quality .  Thanks  Marv
B00NGIKL7A|5|Beautiful I love it
B000GKUGCQ|5|I really like this shirt the photo does not due it justice i highly recomend it! It surpassed all of my expectations.
B002XZMGMU|1|Although this is a very nice leotard at a great price it is advertised as 90% cotton which is why I bought it. What was not disclosed is that the full frontal lining that extends all the way to the crotch area is polyester. This would be a great leotard for people who don't mind polyester. But, for this reason I am returning the white leotard and only giving it one star. I expected a leotard that was 90% cotton as advertised. Just so there is no confusion, it is the white leotard that has a polyester lining in the front of the leotard. The black leotard is great and really is 90% cotton ( I give the black leotard five stars) it just runs small so I am ordering the black leotard in an extra large even though I am only 5 ft 3 inches and 105 pounds.
B0073E533A|5|Fits good. Much better look than others but if not kept from folding, you will have issues later when you unpack it next year. Rubber is soft and will conform to any shape you put it in.
B00JAK0QJG|5|Again, just wonderful. So soft and comfortable.
B001Y1G07G|3|should have known better. all nautica clothing usually runs a size too small. order up and you should be fine - good quality but had to give away since did not fit.
B00HLRIDBS|3|Super cute but ran small.
B0007LXKXQ|4|Perfect little bag at a reasonable price that you do not have to worry if it gets dirt on it, spill on the outside or other things which can ruin its appearance, can always get another one easily and cheaply enough.    The color is what it is, but I like the retro look.      So far it has been good and no problems having the Velcro open up.  Also nice and light.    For the price it is a good buy for general grab and go.
B00D8RZKPC|5|I was a little hesitant to order this but I am so glad I did. I ordered the large even though i am usually a medium. It is still a little tight but the fabric is beautiful and brushes the floor even though I am 5'6&#34;. I LOVE it!
B0027IQJP8|4|They're fine, indeed, not altogether ratty, as they often turn out to be after the first wash. They didn't fall apart after I washed them. Good socks.
B00W1JMXEO|3|It fits my sister good and she usually wears a small but she's in the medium, fits small! Kinda cheap but it's not that bad, stretchy material.
B00ARDDAR0|4|I bought these for my 6 month old daughter's back-up clothes at daycare and was very pleased with them for the price. The cotton is thinner but soft so they are perfect for summer. I also liked that the embroidered designs on each one were soft on the bag so I wasn't worried about them irritating my baby's skin. The colors are true to the pictures and the onesies washed well and didn't shrink or fade.
B00BIFJVOW|4|A little pricey for a cardigan, but I'm worth every penny. I just hope the quality holds up for the price I paid.
B00ARHJUHU|5|I love the feel of how these socks feel.  They are very comfortable and I like the small silicon strip attached to back.
B00JMXGVSQ|5|Was very satisfied .
B00589XRMG|5|I bought this mask so that I could recreate the GEICO camel commercial at work. Now instead of just playing the commercial on my iPad as I walk into work, I wear the camel mask for added effect.<br /><br />The mask is also good for wearing into my favorite lunch spot, Allendale Eats, and announcing, \\"GUESS WHAT DAY IT IS!\\"<br /><br />The camel head mask is great fun--especially on HUMP DAY YEAH!
B009EF4TX6|5|My son loved it ! He was so surprised he did not expect that..Thank you much!<br /><br />Signed<br />Mrs N Dillman
B0076PGC1S|5|I ordered this for my 20 year old son.  The fit is perfect.  He wanted a slouchy beanie & this is the perfect length.  It's super soft & he loves it.
B00HZP9GVM|1|The dress is cute on the hanger.  It looks worse on.  I looked like I was 19 months pregnant (I am not that big).  It was skin tight!
B00BGF4IHY|5|Loved the color and fit. I'm a XS and it is just right. Stretchy material that will fit many sizes.
B00I001JFC|5|I loved it! my niece looks adorable in it, and it fit as excepted. And it is as cute as it is in the picture.
B00LAAFIHO|4|Great socks bit they might be a tad tight. ..  very subjective with calf size,  though!  Not super stretchy, but cute as can be!
B00ABKASFG|5|For great!
B008HUYZII|5|Perfect fit
B00UFVNF2E|4|Beautiful summer color and style, very chic!!
B00N7TCYYQ|4|Good
B00BXT56P6|4|The design of the shemagh is nice but the fabric is very thin and there were a lot of loose threads to get rid of.
B005HPNB0Y|2|These skirts are only fancy ,but they rip open before you even wear them.Bought the burgandy or boyensberry and it ripped as I tried it on .Then I bought the cheetah one and it ripped open in the seam before I even wore it. The material just seems dry rotted.Really a waste of money.
B0010EGIQK|5|These are the perfect work pants! Professional and comfortable at the same time, they are forgiving in size and easy to care for. I ordered 2 of each color to make getting ready for work easy!
B00GYQ5Z2M|2|Great material, but there is NO elastic in the waistband, so all the time you're wearing them you are constantly fighting to keep them up! If they had an elastic waist they would be absolutely perfect! 😊
B00UGUC11A|3|An uncommon image from the film 'Raging Bull'. The shirt fit as to the size I order it. The photo is clear. If taken care of the t-shirt should preserve well. The t-shirt is of a thin quality. If your a film lover of Scorsese, DeNiro or a 'Raging Bull' fan. Then you'll love to ad this shirt to your wardrobe. Enjoy.
B00RL0DZ5O|5|This neck warmer is super soft and is the perfect weight. I love how stretchy it is and it fits in your pocket if it gets too warm. It seemed to get even softer after washing. Love it - would highly recommend!
B00M2NPWFQ|5|So soft and comfy.  I am pleased and so is my daughter. She's hard to please but Take Out is her fabric of choice now.
B004DQE940|5|Ordered and received within 10 days.  Handsome belt, and it works perfectly.  Has some style, without making too big a statement.  Buckle closure takes a bit of getting used to, but works just fine.  Highly recommended.
B0081N0JUO|4|Bought several of these, they tend not to hold coins too well and they rip easily, but I do love the art work.
B00ARPCDEY|5|Incredibly cute, soft, and chic'! Love this item def. worth every penny!!!! I will be wearing this often throughout the cold seasons!
B00G2XEX0W|2|The graphic on the tee is not nearly as big as it looks in the picture.
B00OAA843G|5|Really nice pants but way too long..I'll have to get them hemmed.
B00M107XJI|5|All of the Go Chara products are beautiful and very well made. I bought quite a few of these for my daughter and she is thrilled with each of the pieces.
B0093SODH6|5|Bought this for a fellow Star Wars fan, HE LOVED IT.<br />As did I, so I came back for one for myself! I always get compliments when I wear this shirt, it's unique and I never see someone else wearing this one (except my friend 😜)
B008MP72X8|5|I sent this to my son who was being eaten alive in Baltimore. It worked so well he took th rest of the package for the family to use on vacation at the beach in Ocean City .It not only worked on the mosquitoes but the &#34;no seeums&#34; too. Great product. Quick delivery. Amply supply for family.  M.Allen
B000J2V8MS|4|well for this price it is great,being a long time fan saw the first one in the theaters and my name being Jason .I love all thing Friday the 13th.The mask is a cheap foam type good for display .I got this mainly for the jersey .it is cool the standard is very Large on me 150lb 5'8 but fits like a hockey jersey should.over all I am happy the price I payed was way cheap than I have seen it around halloween (40 bucks)so for this price I jumped on it and am happy with it.
B008XA08J2|5|I was very grateful for the others who mentioned the size they normally wear because I was not familiar with the way this product is sized.  I was a bit nervous, thinking that I would end up sending it back, but they fit just fine...not too small.  I usually wear medium sizing in tops and 10 petite in pants and the size 36 fit very well for me.  The quality is very good and these will probably last years, as others have in the past.  Because I am a tosser and turner, I tend to get all twisted up in any other product other than the nylon, which cuts down on twisting and binding at night for me.<br />Although they are pricey, I am trilled to find the long sleeved version for winter!
B0068EDHBQ|5|These are very nice for the price. I knew that one was not going to fit my size so I ordered two and added some of the elastic belting from one onto the other to make it go the extra 4 inches I needed. After that I used the center front portion and the Velcro from the cut up belt to make an arm bracer! Once I add some Steampunk details like miniature wrenches and such to the arm band bracer, it will look great.<br /><br />Now do not be fooled by the photo, the belt is VINYL, not leather. The sides are elastic and the closure is Velcro. Theses are great for the low cost, but will not hold up as really serious Steampunk wear. I am making a costume for a one-night usage and this product is perfect for me.
B00AEJPN18|3|I didn't liked the price but the shipment was on time! I will be buying this again in a different color and size if they had it. I also got it as a free delivery option as well!
B002P5Q8AY|5|Shipping was fine during the holiday season, gave as a gift, and looked crisp and pretty basic, as was expected.
B001B96V9S|5|These are great pants especially on a cold day.  My grandson loves them!
B005YPVD8E|3|I really don't care for low rise jeans, but I did want light weight striped jeans for the summer. They're comforable however.
B00740RA2A|5|this dress is GORGEOUS! I purchased it for my sister for her daughter's wedding. the dress is true to size. the green is not as dark as shown, but still a beautiful emerald green and makes her eyes look greener.<br />it is a bit long on her, she is 5\\"4\\", and becuase of back problems she cannot wear heels, so she is having it hemmed up.<br />also the VERY SEXY V-neck is a bit low for the mother-of-the-bride, so she is having that sewn-up a little in the front.Amazon has backless/strapless Nubra bras, which we will get to wear with the dress.<br />I am very happy with the dress(my sister is ecstatic), not to mention the great price and no shipping charge with Amazon Prime.
B005442X7K|5|Not a lot more can be said, this cap has great quality at a great price. Just wish they had more available like this for the price.
B00A9S1GYC|4|These glasses are cute and durable.  The only thing I would note is that they seem a bit smaller than other infant/toddler glasses.  They git my niece who is 1 year old, but probably won't fit her for that much longer.
B004H6G2C8|5|Great Jacket.  Bought this for my 6 yr old. Not bulky so he will actually wear it!  Pretty true to size.  I always order a size up on jackets and it fits him perfect.  GREAT PRICE for a GREAT JACKET!!!
B009286KVO|3|This was way too tight for me so I gave it to a friend who wears a size 1.  Yikes!  So order a larger size and I'm sure it will work great..
B00Z8SNM3G|4|Just a little tight, but I think they'll stretch out. Otherwise, I love them!!
B00KNR1ITW|5|Very nice sweater.
B00M0JLWX8|5|The price was great and of course Isotoner gloves are a classic accessory.  When the cold weather hits my hands will be warm and I will look stylish.
B001MZ19RK|4|my only complaint with this bra is that I feel that the band loosens too quickly.  That said I wear as many 30 bands and 32s so I need the 32 to stay tighter than maybe most people using this bra.
B00GL22OZK|5|I wish It could be tighter in the back like it is in front. I have small waist w a big booty so it doesn't cling my curves. But I know that kind of fabric just doesn't work that way. But I love it anyway
B0001YRJZO|5|Great
B0061IBVEY|5|Forgiveness!<br /><br />I had a baby 8 weeks ago, and still have a bit of a pooch. Aside from that, I would have wanted a suit like this anyway, because it gives me all the coverage, while still being sexy, fun and young. I wish they had it in the floral pattern that was offered on Anthropologie, but they didn't, so mine is basic black. Good, because I plan to keep it for years.<br /><br />Sizing: I normally wear an 8 in swimsuits, but after reading the reviews, ordered a 6. I hope I don't wish I'd ordered a 4.<br /><br />Fit: I have larger breasts (DD) from breastfeeding, and this accommodates me well. I have a medium waist, and medium hips, my thighs are muscular but on the fuller side. This just flatters all that. I don't have any issue with binding in the leg, as other reviewers have mentioned. I was afraid of it, but it didn't happen.<br /><br />Price: I did not want to pay the price here, so I bought it NWT form another website. I paid $60 for it. Still more than I thought I'd be paying for a swimsuit this year! But I'm the kind of person who buys one and keeps it for years. I have had my previous boring suit for 7 years already. It was time to switch it up.
B00DKWDW7I|3|This suit is so incredibly cute with super bright colors and great quality. I purchased the size M and when I received the suit the top was a medium and bottoms were a large. The size medium top fits very small...would work great for a size A or B cup but larger would look funny due to the padding and underwire. I am keeping the suit because I love the color combo and I am going to try and find a matching top on my own.
B00DGBXJQW|5|👌🏻
B001P6FOHC|5|beautiful, rich-looking, and goes with every color shirt.  this tie makes dress shirts look even dressier.  I got it for someone as a gift and they loved it.
B00FYF53BC|5|Very comfy
B00BTX7RIU|5|Absolutely love this wallet!!!!
B002XGZTB4|5|Bought one for my mother....she loved them.  Wife got jealous so I bought her an identical set (I like to live on the edge).  She, too, loved them.  They're well made and luxurious.  Highly recommend.
B003WY3X9G|4|It's a nice product but a tight fit with a winter sweater underneath.
B00A806CWC|3|I tried to follow the sizes chart, since I dont usually buy cloth this way, and the size I received is HUGE !  I will have to fix it up. The tunic is soo pretty buy size is not at all real. I´d go 2 sizes down.
B009NRZR0Y|5|Very nice product
B00K25KWEW|5|My running teen loved it
B00DECHAJU|5|My son loved it!!
B00BEW2ONE|4|Love it
B00MQ1J714|5|Very cute and was very pleased with it! Fast shipping also
B00M0L1Q9G|5|I bought 2 for grandkids they loved them
B00K5A69RI|5|This tie was great for job interview I had. I did get the job I wanted.👏
B009T8TACI|5|This arrived quickly and well-wrapped.  It's a lovely belt and I am very happy with my purchase!  It looks just like it does in the picture.
B002B61CCQ|4|nice vest- just a little small.  i wish they'd had one size bigger but this one will work out fine.
B001I4MUWS|5|I purchased this to fill with accessories when doing onsite photo shoots. It can fit an extra telephoto lens, with other accessories like backup battery, memory, lens brush and other little stuff too. Awesome because it goes around your waist like a belt and does not get in your way at all.
B00A7I4XT4|5|Love these!
B005L4MVL6|4|We ordered a few sets for a winter trip to the mountains - these will be perfect.  The fabric is nice - not thin, and also not too thick where my daughter would sweat while she sleeps.  She was a bit dissapointed that they didn't fit tightly across her torso, but she's tall for her age (10) and wears a slim.  There is a snap flap at the top of the zipper - works fine.  My son got a pair from a different manuf/vender, which doesn't have this flap...  the zipper doesn't stay up so well.  Overall we are pleased with these pjs - they'll certainly be a favorite this winter!
B00JK4OBCK|4|I would recommend this for little girls - much larger than 4 years and it definitely wouldn't fit. It is cute, it is durable and my 3 year old loves it.
B00L4Y95A2|1|very cheap and silky material.  Dont waste your money on this! VERY poorly made
B008QWA8AG|4|The length was shorter than anticipated.
B0095FE0E8|5|Great - Engraving was correct
B00NBS7HV8|2|The picture makes it look like a real sweatshirt, with like fleece lining and everything... its like a children's pajama top. U can see the spacemen design on the inside of the sort, that's how thin it is
B006BL2O1U|2|I enjoy the shirt but after just one wash the letters started to peel off. By the third the S is gone along with the ending LE.<br />A bit disapointed.
B005XAJ422|2|certainly does not feel like cashmere and is too small.<br />I love the print, and it looks great on my mother, except for the fit. The Dolman sleeves are good because it makes it easier to put it on/off of her.<br />But I don't recommend this because the fabric is inferior.
B008J1OBCA|4|Adorable, but not spectacular. This product is similar to the one in the picture, but the band is slightly different (thinner). Nice accessory, but I don't expect it to last forever. The color, however, is exactly as pictured.
B0015ZVV5M|5|This was just about true to size of the sizing chart online. It's comfortable and light weight. I was extremely satisfied with this product!
B002GKIMO8|5|It's just like others saying,it's a continuous investment,it works perfect, but you have to buy a smaller one very soon.
B00TZ66752|4|Love them
B004UUK470|5|Very thick, furry, and comfortable. Looks just like the picture! I wore this with a Halloween costume but it's great for any cold day.
B00GUYU63G|3|Great leggings, but they didn't wash very well. Got kinda pilly--
B00IAIEN6Q|4|Very cute, but a little small for a dress for my 3 month old.. It's adorable with white leggings for a shirt, though!
B00A4N7YOS|5|I'm a bald guy! OK, that's out in the open.  Meaning, I have a lot of hats.  This one is my very favorite summer hat! Stylish and comfortable!
B001U3F6NW|5|Please ignore the reviews that tell you to order larger than expected. You shouldnt expect uniformity in \\"small/medium/large\\" online anyway. Meaure your hips and waist with a measuring tape and then order the appropriate size based on INCHES, not \\"I normally wear size X\\"!!! My measurements put me at a small but I ordered a medium because of these reviews, and it was WAY too big! Luckily Girls4Sport is awesome about returns so I was able to return and get a small, but I still had to pay to ship it back.<br /><br />As for the shorts themselves, now that I have the correct size, I think they're great! I was looking for long shorts that fit snug at the waist but with room everywhere else, and these fit the bill perfectly! They're not very showy on the rump (much to my Beau's dismay), but I prefer something conservative for public-wear. The material is very soft and overall the shorts are very comfortable. So glad to have found long board shorts when everyone else sells nothing but \\"aquatic daisy dukes\\"!!
B00WOKHQ92|5|Great traveling dress!! No wrinkles! As dressy or casual as you want to make it!! Washes easy and comes straight from the dryer ready to wear!!
B003IC096C|5|If you want to look like a hot disco daddy wear this...Nuff said. the fit is snug so I went with the largest size I could get and it worked out. Also there are no pockets on the pants so I didn't wear them because WHERE would I put my phone and car keys???
B00D4KGTW6|4|i like it
B00OPIXA6O|5|Fits just as I expected.  Prompt delivery.
B00C3B7I22|4|I love the fabric, but the one size fits all is not true.  I'm not a heavy person and it did not wrap around all the way.
B007HKPARO|2|Hi friends, I cancel for 2 Danskin women's long sleeve leotard and I recived diferents size. I disliked it because is too big for me.The  other one is my size and isnt easy to change yhe big size from Venezuela. I hope in my future shoping you will sent the apropiate size. Thanks for your concerns, Have a nice day
B003LD0Q02|2|Looks nice but the fabric is too thin, so in bunches up and twists too easily.  Would not buy again.
B00IT0BQEM|5|This backpack is killin it! Great for every day use or traveling. Im a drummer and my stick bag fits perfectly in the computer pocket and keeps them nice and snug so I can also fit headphone, my assignment book, music book, keys, and more. And then I can strap my skateboard to it. Again, killin it!
B00D470J2U|1|I'm a 10-12 US.  I ordered at 12-14 US (14-16 UK) as I read the review saying it was small.  I had no idea how small it would really be.  It barely makes it out from under my armpits!  Also, colors are fine, but not at all as pictured.  I did receive it in record-breaking time -- one month before it said it would get here.  It arrived much earlier than expected.  Said it would get here by July 17 (as it comes from the UK) but it actually arrived on June 14, eight days from the order date.
B00CIRETWS|5|My daughter is thrilled with her leotard and matching scrunchie! She is a size 5/6T and the Intermediate fit perfectly. Stays put during gymnastics class.
B008BVHWVU|5|This is a beautiful, well made robe! It looks and feeeeeeeels like silk! Many robes being made lately are mid calf...even on a 5'4'' frame! This length comes to my ankles! LOVE IT!
B00910V62Q|5|this is so awesome, im glad i bought this. It is worth it for the quality. the fabric is nice and soft and it has pockets :D i would recommend this to anybody who likes pikachu.
B001O20ZA8|5|I have been searching and searching for the perfect dress for my 2, 3 and 4 year old to wear to my Mom's wedding.  I purchased 3 of these in pink and white and am very pleased with my selection.  After looking and searching and not finding anything I came across these and the price couldn't have been better.  My girls look GORGEOUS in the dress!!!  The dress is very well made and the fit is perfect!!  I would definitely recommend this dress to anyone!!
B004BKZPQ4|5|Love my unicorn socks!
B001OAMTQI|5|I've worn these socks for years.  They are comfortable, fit right, and last a long time.  I highly recommend them.
B00IPDIHP4|5|so so very soft……love it
B00L4BDQCI|5|VERY COMFORTABLE
B00NIQGPVG|4|Looks great
B00O8F8POQ|5|Very happy with the design and quality of these PJ's.
B006G9MRNW|5|Very comfortable
B000SP6UVK|5|I wear a size 13 shoe and I have a wide foot. These are the best fitting socks I have found anywhere. They are a quality made sock with a lot of comfort. They are cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
B00EKNUDWI|5|Super comfortable! Perfect maternity shapers!
B004D1WKM8|5|Perfect!
B00575UHP6|4|I bought this because I just got a new Lenovo Z series laptop and wanted something to throw it in and some extra gear, (mini-router, ethernet cables, blank discs, and tablet).  It fits perfectly and holds a decent amount.<br /><br />My only complaint and what cuts it down a star, is the top where you slide the laptop in to the pouch that's integrated into the back of the backpack doesn't have a flap or any protection on the top.  Granted to hit the top you'd have to drop it on the top of the backpack but I'd feel better if it had a flap that came over and cushioned that also.<br /><br />Overall I like it and it looks nice, the truck straps for skateboards are nice and sturdy too.
B00JFYUYQW|4|I'm 5' 6&#34; and 160lbs, fit great- my guy loved it.
B00FFX7YGA|2|These are very cute, but I really wish I'd tried them on before washing them. They're too small and I ordered my regular size. Definitely go up a size when you order.
B00FZ3L7JA|5|Nice quality.
B004YZ83TM|5|I wanted to dock them one star for not looking anything like the pictures, but they're just so amazing that I couldn't do it. If you are anything like me, you look at the boys socks and underwear and secretly fume because although the girls clothing is arguably cuter, it's not even half as durable, so you secretly wish you could get boys underwear, so that it lasts for longer than three months before the elastic band starts to separate from the panties to they just wear out. These are the answer to that. They are soft and strong and they last forever. They also have the cloth fold over the elastic like they do for boys briefs. Plus, as an added bonus, they get softer with each wash. All told, if you have a girl that's active like mine is, these are the panties you want to get. Best value, best comfort. Just probably not going to look like the pictures.
B00FAX3I4M|4|These arent bad but not as good as Alisha ankle jeans (of which I have now purchased my 6th pair). I bought them for the colour which is fine but the 14 is a fraction tighter than other NYDJ. Not that it doesnt fit, its just not as flattering. Or rather its not as perfect as I would have liked. Since discovering this brand they are the only jeans I would buy. While I am normally a 16 the 14 is perfect.
B000UVVI9Q|5|Great buy!
B007NDSDO2|5|My Husband LOVED it! Great presentation box and Seller was on point with description. 5*
B00JWGUCZ6|5|Bought this messenger bag for my son and he loves it. Big enough to carry his iPad and stuff to school without looking like a purse.
B00EC8A7M2|5|Very comfortable pair of pants
B00CC7F8NS|5|Love this little outfit, however, beware, it is extremely small for a 0-3 month.  I would say it is a &#34;newborn&#34; size.  My granddaughter is about 8 lbs. 6 oz. and almost 21 inches long.  The arms and legs are definitely too short and the top section is tight.  Luckily she has a thinner frame, otherwise her arms would not fit into the sleeves.  I would say size up for sure.
B001HLMMMK|5|Great fit, wonderful ventilation and design, collapsible, and made-in-USA, too. What a deal!
B00TG2JYFA|5|I ordered this swimsuit and I have  al large bust. Once I ordered I contacted the seller to ask for a large bottom with my xtra large top they said that they didn't mix and match sizes so I was a bit worried. My bathing suit arrived in a timely manner I think about 4 days and fits perfectly I love it. The top fits wonderfully and would say the bottoms run a smidge small because I can fit the xtra large just fine.
B00BTMYOLE|3|Got this for a costume.<br /><br />I got a small, and it's way too large. I'm skinny, but not *that* skinny (30 waist, this was supposed to fit 28-30). I had to cut the end of the bowtie because its tightest fitting was too loose, and I had to pull stitches out of the waist tightening thingy on the vest so I could tighten it enough.<br /><br />Weird.<br /><br />Otherwise it's exactly what it looks like. Maybe even a little nicer in the detail than expected (it was a costume, I didn't care).
B005GW044E|5|I absolutely love them. I am very pleased
B005Z65GDK|3|I am only give this three stars because I don't like the way the straps feel on my shoulders. They are thin with no padding. otherwise I like the bra.Fit like it was supposed to.
B00HDA2WIS|4|Item is adorable, but it's much too large for my 1 month old.
B005OFLT7O|1|it is too large than expected, I recoment that  if you want to buy this product select a small size that you are
B00BVD017C|5|Ok, when I  recieved these jeans they arrived in a very basic some what small package.  I open the package to find &#34;toddler size&#34; pants. I said what the heck and tried them on. OMG... these are the best jeggings I have put on in a long time! I wear size 10 and have lots of hips and butt! These pants fit like a dream and they lift the dereair! They fit so good I bought some for my Mom who is over 50 :)! They are really great pants for any age! They even arrived at my home early, it doesn't get any better than that!
B00HF4N2UO|4|IT''S OK!
B00DFQYITK|3|very tight for an XL
B000J4DG6C|1|The coat quality was poor. It was very thin and looked cheap. I returned unworn.
B007C1IB4M|5|Love it. My baby boy looks amazing on it. Nice matterial, beautiful colors, nice fit in. I really love it :)
B00KZMD956|4|My fiance absolutely loves it!
B00FLYSZ4I|5|good job
B00G6JV0LW|1|Unfortunately I need to return this dress. It was not flattering at all. Because of the fabrication, it looked cheap and felt that way too.
B00JHCS3BU|5|Great fit!
B006WWVIU6|4|It is a nice dress. Fits true to size.<br />However, the fabric is too thin, transparent and get wrinkled. It looks cheap.<br />I won't use it for a party, only for summertime days.
B00CPG5OD0|5|I got the vista blue green colored scarf, and it just arrived today. It took less than a week to ship, so that's always a plus.<br />Its very soft, and absolutely gorgeous. I took a picture to show some people, and they all want one too. Perfect accessory for fall.
B003N957RG|4|Not flimsy but not heavy,  no peeling off so far. Inside foam lining tore off easily, but easy to glue back on.
B00EKG5LT0|3|I ordered the black bag but received the navy blue bag instead. I think their shipping person is color blind. Amazon gave me the option of either returning the bag for a refund or accepting a discounted price. I decided to take the discount offer and keep the bag (especially since I was unsure of what color I might receive if I tried to purchase it again).<br /><br />The bag's construction seems pretty sturdy and houses my Macbook Pro 15&#34; Retina comfortably along with my additional books. I am very pleased with the bag, but I really wish I could have received the black one I ordered, otherwise I would have rated this with 5 stars.
B00PUWUSBO|5|Ok
B00K0WMCPO|5|Perfect for casual comfort!
B0014GYXKM|5|My daughter wears this to dance. She says it is comfortable and it matches a lot if her leotards. So far it has held up well with regular washing.
B00CF223V0|4|Sexy & Comfortable! These Tights are Head Turners!!<br />I actually purchased mines in store for $4 & couldnt refuse buying all colors
B00BNHIEG6|4|Highly recommend these bibs.  Material is sturdy without being stiff at all.  They're incredibly easy to wash and they dry really quickly.  Love the catcher pocket at the bottom. Easy on/easy off.  They lasted so well that I gave them away, still in very good condition, when our newest addition to the family outgrew them!
B00MVEG7K0|4|Super cute!! They're not full socks tho, like the whole foot part isn't there. It just goes to your ankle, not complaining though, still really cute with boots. I have pretty thin legs so they were alittle big on me. Super nice material, and shipping was super fast. I'm glad I purchased (:
B002HR1R3S|4|Fits pretty well - I'm a large, ordered a large, and it fits, even with the belly attachment.<br /><br />Gloves are OK for the costume; I wouldn't want to use them to perform surgery, but they're fine.<br /><br />My one concern is having the moustache stay attached; haven't tried it yet but am considering have some sort of &#34;helper&#34; attachment (soft clip; elastic), just in case.<br /><br />All in all, I'm satisfied; looking forward to the Cub Scouts that this will be worn for tripping out...!
B00JQGLDO6|4|I washed this shirt once and it was still a little itchy or scratchy, I am hoping with the second wash it makes it softer. The fit is for a slim, thin or athletically shaped person, Toned, not muscled......but if this describes you this shirt looks great!
B004SWJ51G|5|I don't normally write reviews, but my satisfaction with this sweatshirt is that great. I bought the Dark Navy and Brown colors, and wear them pretty much every day. I live in North Dakota, and I know cold, so it's gotten below zero almost every day for the past several weeks. I can go out to the store or wherever I need to go with only a t-shirt under this sweatshirt. So long as it isn't overly windy, I'm comfortable. I'm going to eventually pick up a couple more in other colors.<br /><br />I washed these sweatshirts in warm water and let them air dry. They didn't shrink at all and was like new again, with no tears in the liner or otherwise.
B00509BNMA|5|These run a little smaller than some older Luck Brand Jeans that I own and always thought ran large.  I would consider these a normal fir compared to other brands and the deep blue color looks great.
B00L216JT2|1|It was nothing like what was shown. Material was poor and an XL looked like a 5 yr old normal child could wear. Returned item and seller refunded me full price plus my shipping costs to them.
B007L7HFPI|4|I ordered this dress for friends upcoming wedding. It arrived faster than expected and was beautifully. Packaged. The dress itself is very nice. I would warn a taller person about it because I am only 5'3\\" and with 3inch heals on this dress just brushes the floor...would be way too short fora taller person..but for me it's perfect!
B00KIL37W4|5|Awesome fit
B00J2TPKZA|4|Great jeans I will order more.
B002F1ULX8|5|I buyed this jacket as a gift for my father, I am really happy, is of excellent quality and also very pretty. pleased to have made this purchase
B00FZR1CIW|4|Just what I wanted--giant cotton panties to see me through my third trimester of pregnancy and most likely postpartum as well.  I ordered two sizes bigger than what I wore pre-pregnancy and they feel comfortable.  Hopefully they'll hold up well too!
B00MZ1EENQ|5|Really, this is the piece my wardrobe has been waiting for! It is a great layering piece. I love wearing it with skinny pants, a thin top, and a scarf.  It fits well, and the quality is a lot better than I was expecting.  So pleased.
B00IR4PDX0|1|I received this item and did not even try it on because of it's poor quality. It also took forever to arrive and I have not return it as of yet. Please do not waste your money on this item.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00EVH8GEK|5|I have been purchasing these sweatshirts in various colors for years.  Russell athletic sweat shirts quality surpass other brands.
B00FB6K2OW|5|Great fit Great look, and fits tall guys really well.If you are tall and are looking for a mid length fit these are your best choice.
B00KMH37G0|4|I love it! Will get one for my daughter.
B000RK6PTS|5|I originally purchased these shorts in size 44 thinking that much clothing today is cut a tad too tight for my corpulent tummy. The 44 inch waist was a comfortable fit, but the legs were too baggy for my taste. So I reordered in the next size down... and they are PERFECT. I would say the 42&#34; waist is generous without having to engage the expandable panels. The legs are roomy but not sloppy. I am quite pleased with the fit as well as the quality of workmanship. A very good buy for the money, in my opinion.<br /><br />Bernie
B005OKDXMI|3|They are warm. I wear them under my jeans. However, one of the pairs is defected. It's a bit smaller, then other 2 and harder to put on, it doesn't have a nice feeling, and it had a big hole!
B00UL68C80|5|I love it
B00P2050K8|5|SOOO beautiful! Thank you so much. I really like it, the material is so comfortable and cute. I recommend it. Size M fix perfect on me! Buy it!!!
B0092KDYAW|4|Great value, well made
B0097Z1H8I|5|Bought as a gift. Perfect lightweight shirt, fabric is nice and appears to be quality, pleased with purchase.  Have bought from store as well as the quality of online product appears to match.
B00HVBT0KM|4|I like this dress, It looks nice and fits well. I will buy it again in all available colors.
B000V5BE68|3|These socks seem to be great quality but are way too tight for my daughter's legs and leave bad read marks so I try not to use them very often.  I needed taller socks to go with the braces she needs to wear and they are hard to find since most socks seem to be the short ones that barely come above the ankle.  Some taller socks are a lot more expensive than what I wanted to pay but I was hopeful that these would work and was disappointed that they were so tight.  I'm sure on a very petite kid they would work great.
B0097YCVLQ|2|They are too tight even thought it is my size.
B008DGG5BG|3|I think she'll use it in one year or so :) But she like it a lot. The quality looks good
B008XOXGCE|5|This is a great product! They fit great and come in a bunch of fun colors!. I got a pair in every available color :)
B0016A1GC4|5|I found a new source for my Dickies. They were even delivered on Sunday! Thanks.
B00GWR20VC|4|For being Columbia's heaviest flannel I could find, it fell short on the heavy. It is still a very attractive flannel print and soft material. Medium Fit is smaller than expected, so passed it from my construction working husband to my slim 25 year old son, who looks very nice in it.
B0019LMNB8|1|cheep as S***
B00ITH9QD8|4|nice shirt
B00FAYHQXU|5|These are a nice, comfortable, and cute pair of shorts made of very stretchy, good quality denim.
B006NDAEPE|5|Kids love it
B006SY88RE|5|'Calcutta' cloth, this is not;  rather, it is stiff ribbed poly/cotton (65/35);  but it is not uncomfortable.  Feel against the skin, is somewhere between seersucker and denim.  Very durable.  Wish they made a jacket in this same material; it would be a nice complement, because the stiff fabric would make for a nice jacket drape.<br /><br />Comfortable, relaxed fit.  If you order sizes larger than you normally wear, put a drawstring in the waist.  'Lemon ice' name is accurate (like real lemon ice); color is not shiny.<br /><br />After two washings I see no pilling whatsoever.  The pants do not shrink when washed in hot water and tumble dried on high cotton heat.  I've tried doing that twice to the pants, first on a normal length cycle and then on prolonged, hoping the hot water would shrink the oversized pants I bought.  There is no fabric damage, either.  So if you want the pants to fit as shown in the picture, order your true size.<br /><br />I only paid $7.50 for these, and that's a bargain.
B00C1024G0|5|Love the wallet just what i was looking for
B008YDHTEU|5|very soft material  I love these jeans.  will purchase other colours.  I recommend these jeans
B006LHMADG|5|The only brand I will buy now. I have several pairs from YEARS ago that still look and fit great.  I just ordered 6 more to replace other brands like Old Navy and Jockey.  These are simply the best value.
B0058ZVVYQ|2|At first these seemed to fit really well. The size was great and the material feels nice.<br />But after wearing them just one time the snagged and continue to snag very easily.<br />Never had this issue with O'Neill before.
B00D2PA992|2|Skirt is cut very full; too full and long for me.  As a size 4, I looked lost in it.  Did not like the feel of the fabric; it also had a very short, filmsy slip, which is inadequate for discreet coverage ( I would have to wear a slip underneath which would make it hot to wear).  All together, I did not like the skirt and returned it.
B000PQI08S|2|Material was flimsy thought it'd be a little sturdier for the money. Love the color tho.
B009AZ0682|5|I purchased this mask for myself to wear to a New Years Eve masquerade party. I was amazed with the detailed designs, quality, durability and comfort of the masks. Several people complimented me on the beauty. I will definitely order from this seller again
B00EZJALQA|1|i dont like it
B00Q432DFM|4|Cap is a little stiffer on the front where &#34;Diesel&#34; is placed. I prefer hats that aren't &#34;boxy looking&#34;! I like them to fit closer to my head. I would like this a lot better if the DIESEL area layed against my head instead of sitting at a more 90  degree angle.<br /> All in all with all my complaints it's a good looking hat!  Was going to send it back but, ultimately decided to keep it.
B00RW62PZS|3|This runs to the small size and is very short in the front!
B00KT8YYQ4|2|Was a great looking jacket until the zipper broke. Zipped it up on a windy day, and it got stuck. The zipper then snapped instead of coming down.<br /><br />Happened right after the 30 day window too.. Luckily it snaps too, so it's usable but leaks wind in.<br /><br />Also fits pretty tight around the shoulders and will really limit your flexibility while driving if you have broad shoulders.
B00SNCVCZ4|5|Sexy Dress! Simple and exotic elegance. I have a few of them in other colors. Lots of class because it is LONG! I'm tall /6ft and the dress is below my knees. Thank You!  I ordered larger size so I can take it up to fit MY shape. Small waist and large hips! I have other colors and I Love the cut of the dress. Oh Please make more colors and patterns. just keep the length. I will buy more. If You're short at least you can hem it. I personally think you get more use /options out of a dress If it is below your knee  if you have class and work in  or visit a professional environments .
B00KNCCU2G|5|Fits perfectly and has kept it's shape/color through multiple washes. V neck not too revealing. Definitely plan on ordering more!
B00GD3VADY|5|My son love it and fits perfectly
B00J3HEP84|3|I was hoping this was a robe, but it's more of loose fitting, one size fits all gown. It's mostly silk, but there is some synthetic fiber in it that tends to make me overheat whenever I use it to do my make up and hair. But for the price this &#34;robe&#34; is very lovely.
B00NR4DSQ4|5|This dress is beautiful，I love this dress. The detail is absolutely beautiful!Arrived on time, great quality and looks exactly as shown in pictures! Definitely will recommend them to friends and family.
B00YXJ2HPK|3|The quality of garments is good but the size is too small than the regular sizes in the US...
B0078Z05NM|5|I had to iron it a bit once i took it out of the package, besides that I love the costume and the skirt especially. The costume does not come with gloves or fish nets, the gloves I have and fishnets go perfect!!
B008LYEPHG|2|Beware, this is not the jersey worn for the Olympics.  This is the regular Adidas Mexico national team jersey.  The Olympics one was brand Atletica.
B00JL6PRQ6|5|Very nice
B00A6QDSHK|5|Got this for my wife this year for Christmas. She raves constantly about how warm and soft it is. Got matching slippers to go with it and needless to say, it definitely got me some brownie points this year :) Thanks!
B00APELXAW|5|I love the quality. my daughter loves wearing them. i would recommend them to friends. i will buy more. great purchase
B00SQDHKP6|5|This ring is beautiful and I love sterling silver jewelry. Great customer service as well!! Thank you!!:)
B008A75V0E|5|They worked out really good for me. I was nervous when I was reading what everyone else said. But they fitted me perfectly.
B005EVKRLC|3|The quality is great but it is wayyy too big.  I usually wear a medium in jackets, coats, etc., so I ordered a medium for this peacoat, but it fit me like a large.  The shoulders were wide, and the waste was extremely wide for me.  However, I will admit the quality of the peacoat is excellent.  It is very warm and comfortable, but I'm going to have to return it due to the size issue.
B00AY540N4|5|Very adorable bow!
B00114RLA6|5|Bought these for my daughter who lives in the USA.  She is a fanatical cat lover and loved these socks.  Amazon is a life saver when you live so far apart. (I am in the UK)
B00JGHNLXG|5|I bought for my 2 years old, he wears shirts xxs (4 - 5). It fits fine, it almost the same size, a bit small. This shirt is 4-5. I would buy it again!!! The shirt is nice, good quality, not hot.. I love it!
B0084745NE|5|The tie is exactly what I was looking for: pre-tied with an adjustable strap. The pattern is exactly as shown; very good value.
B00CS7Y46E|3|The quality is about what you would expect for a belt under $10. I ordered copper, but it was more of a dark brass as there is no pink tint that one would expect with copper. It was also about 2 inches shorter than stated.
B00FKNHHY4|5|I got this for my husband and am impressed with the quality! This is a much thicker material then the shirts you get at the big box stores and it has a nice ribbed detail on the wrist bands and waist which give it a more expensive feel. My husband is a size large in most all clothes so I feel this is true to fit. The hood is a nice size and looks good on, not that he wears the hood up often. I am going to purchase this in other colors as they are great for california fall and winter time. I was able to receive this at a discount for an honest opinion.
B004RKYSD4|5|This is a great t-shirt. I have been looking for an undershirt that I can wear underneath button down shirts but that would keep me cool. This definitely does the job.
B00DLK1IVQ|4|a little too tight in the the under arm
B00JHDHEFU|5|My wife loves these socks.
B000RN04RY|4|I love Le Mystere and bought this because I wear the Dream Tisha and the Lace Tisha.  This fits totally different then both of those.  I ordered my normal size and I was busting out.  Overall, I gave a high rating because the bra was well made, it just wasn't the right fit for me.
B00IF85A4K|4|I've never worn a corset before. I got it mainly for waist training and as an abdominal binder. It's very slippery and not stretchy so maneuvering it is difficult at first. You have to have the laces loose in back to be able to latch the clips in front. Also, it came with both sets of laces meeting in the middle of the back which made it really hard to tie by myself. I re-threaded the laces so the top laces start at the top of the bust and end in the middle, and the bottom laces start in the middle and go down to the waist. Not only do I get better control of tightening the bust and waistline, it's easier to tie bc all the laces aren't getting tied up in each other. The bottom front sits about an inch below my belly button (I am long waisted), so it doesn't cover the entire post c-section pooch above the scar, but it gets most of it. If you have a shorter torso, it'll prob cover you more.   I measured myself and ordered by matching my exact measurements with the size chart and it fits perfectly - I can get it super tight and it's not overlapping, and it also only shows about an inch of the modesty panel. I could have maybe ordered down one size but then the laces might not be long enough. They are pretty long though and you have to be careful of tucking them away during everyday use.   I like this because I can get it really tight and still breathe, stretch and reach because there are no shoulder straps and it sits low enough that your upper body is free to move. It's very firm and lots of support. I can even wear this under a t-shirt bc it is not bulky and I can get everything snug so there's no bulges of material or skin.  You have to bend over with a flat back and not slouch or hunch over. This corset is somehow more comfortable than the spanx and other stretchy body firming under garments. They feel more constricting to me than the corset. It also makes you compress your abdomen so you end up strengthening core muscles in the back and abdomen.
B00DYVCUDW|5|Very cute! Fits great.
B006O5OYKC|5|I love Hue stockings.  They are so soft and fit great.  I also ordered the flower design hue stocking. Love them all.
B00AEE7LCW|5|These socks are the loveliest I've ever owned, soft, not binding, I will buy more.
B004OYZM4W|5|Nice shirts. I suppose they are weighted light, for summer. Otherwise, you may want to consider a higher thread count.
B00AQE88MM|4|good shorts don't wrinkle easily and wash up good
B00KBZRBK6|5|I bought them for myself (female) as a sleep shirt.  I love that they are tapered at the sleeves, keeps them from riding up at night when I need to keep my arms warm as I don't move much in my sleep.
B00B777P8K|3|The tie itself is great but it is more orange than coral in my opinion.
B00N1DOL62|5|There was an out of ordinary situation with product and zipper and manufacturer not doing correct thing.  Both Amazon and seller immediately helped and made me happy.  This is a trustworthy seller.
B009A117N4|5|Belt works awesome very unique  ratcheting  system fits great works well with concealed fire arms.
B00DMEAZOC|4|Good value , however the size is for first notch not the center one so it will only fit the smallest saize listed.
B003YHFAC4|1|This belt is not worth even $5 in my opnion. The gold is flaked off and the quality is poor, don't waste your time.  I'd return it but it's not worth paying the shipping. Keep on lookin'
B003XU6S5U|4|Nice belt-fits well
B0084YJCV2|5|Very sexy, form fitting...great!!!  Looks very hot with stilettos.  Perfect fit for curves. I recommend this dress to add fun with your partner.
B000NGK75E|2|Have never worn thigh high hose but did not like and will not buy anymore
B001FT4K88|5|great
B000R4Y7YO|1|Don't waste your time it's that &#34;binded&#34; leather &#34;wanna be&#34;.  Not worth it, take the time & couple extra bucks to buy a real 100% leather belt that will last (try Ralph Lauren on sale).
B00L3EXPIQ|5|Super cute and we'll made. Buy our of season to save money.
B00AG93STA|1|Fit ok but STANK.  Someone with extremely bad BO had obviously tried this on and returned it.  UGH.
B00YIWD8RS|3|I followed the sizing guidelines on Amazon, and found the large to be a bit too big for my 36C chest. I also find the fit too loose for good pumping it. Sometimes the suction is lost. I don't know whether a smaller size would resolve this issue.  The Simple Wishes bro works better, but this one is more comfortable for every day wear.
B00CLPJUD0|5|It arrive earlier than what I expected.  I love my dress. I'm 5'8 with curves, and this dress fits every one of my curves.  I like that the dress is not short, it's right at my knee...perfect.  If you're over 160 lbs, which I am, I suggest the med/lg size.
B008MCZ2M4|5|Awesome shirt. I have not washed it but I plan on sending it to the cleaners so I am not worried about shrinkage.
B00V75NQIK|3|the sizes was too small for a 6 year old
B00LITBWN6|5|Love it! Came before the delivery estimate! Did not come tangled or broken came in perfect condition! Thank you!
B00F8Q33ZU|4|I work for a company that provide RFID sleeves and Now I feel more secure with the wallet.
B00DUHTKRO|5|Very nice!
B005USHJT2|4|I ordered this wallet for myself and purchased it because it looked cute and practical.  After receiving it, I'm quite pleased! The design and colors are very cute in person and the quality seems top notch.  The only thing that is a little detracting is that it's a little thicker than I expected when all the slots are filled with cards!  Perhaps that is just the result of this being a \\"compact\\" wallet.  Anyway, it does not make the wallet bulge or anything and it closes easily - it's just a bit thicker than I expected.  I still love it though and am overall very happy with my purchase!
B00KGR1AU6|5|Fits as expected.  My 10 yr old daughter loves it.
B00I3JJS58|5|Excellent Quality. Fits just right. Would purchase again.
B005X4TWKC|4|I agree with reviewer Nature Lover.  This scarf is absolutely lovely, but the weave is very loose and it would be very easy to pull a thread.  The colors are absolutely lovely and it would go well with any color you choose to wear.  I am not a fan of glitter or shimmery items but the glitter is subtle enough to suit me.  This scarf is very light weight - it feels feathery and soft.  I would recommend it.
B00TDK01J8|3|2 of the colors could have been more gender neutral.
B00HFODIK8|5|Love them  - great quality.
B001ICSJ3O|5|I received this backpack as a gift, and I couldn't be happier. The first think I noticed was the quality handle. A steel cable? You've got to be kidding me.... The zippers are smooth and hefty, and the pull tabs are strong and heavy. I couldn't believe the number of pockets in this thing. It's got a really nice, mid-size pocket accessible from the top that makes it really convenient to throw in a portable mouse and power cable without stuffing it into a bottom pocket and making a huge bulge or having to scrounge around for it in a hurry. There are pockets on both sides which may not look like much at first, but I can stuff it full of miscellaneous items like a spare mouse, a bottle of ibuprofin, and some small tools without cluttering up the front pockets where I keep things that are accessed more frequently. It's got a heavy duty clip near the handle that can easily handle something like a water bottle clasp, even though it's got a pocket on the side for a water bottle too! I use the clip for my keys, though it's also got a key clip inside the front pocket too. It's got a nice, big, full-sized pocket in the middle that would fit a large portfolio, and a little pocket inside of that for something like an ethernet cable. The laptop compartment is only accessible from the side, which I didn't think I'd like at first - but it's fine. There seems to be plenty of padding, though this is one item I found that could be an issue. I placed the laptop on a hard floor one time, and my laptop \\"clunked\\" because there isn't much padding on the bottom of the bag. It would have been simple for the manufacturer to place a little rubber pad inside the bag at the bottom, but now that I am aware that there isn't, I can simply be a bit more careful when I set the down. The back has lots of padding, and claims to allow for some unique airflow. I'm not sure how much I believe that, but I haven't noticed my back getting hot. The straps are very strong with reinforcements and plenty of roomfor my 6' 230lb frame, with a little pocket for a multitool or flashlight on one side and a loop for sunglasses on the other. I didn't see it at first, but my coworkers noticed that there is a little icon on one of the straps that looks like a pair of eyeglasses. A very small, but nice little detail. And the ends of the straps have nice little plastic finger loops to prevent them from fraying, and to ease tightening. The bag is chock full of these little quality details. Overall this thing is like a tank - a bit heavy due to all the quality components and construction. But that is a trade-off I am happy to make for this bag. I love the thing.
B0013KEWSW|4|This dress is very nice.  I use it for a dummy character and it works just as I liked.  Done
B002YY4MRM|5|This was better than expected !
B00JILKYLW|4|i ordered a blue pair few months back giving it some time for wear and tear before writing this review and purchasing additional color.  the item was from china, cotton was ok soft for the price.  it snugged comfy around the package area, but does have  low rise bikini line.  i have a big bubble butt so it barely covers all of it but it was ok, looks quite sexy and i like it.  bought 3 other different color, green, yellow and red so my collection are bright.
B0046EHCD4|5|This brand of lingerie is wonderful in that it carries sizes for larger women. The previous commenter apparently mistook the brand for true corseting. You would never find a true, body-shaping corset for less than $30; they're expensive because of the quality of stitching, boning, and material required to truly force a body into a chosen shape.<br /><br />These corsets and cinchers do exactly what they're supposed to do: they look sexy. They make wonderful lingerie, and they have the added benefit of working well in costuming (over a medieval dress, or as part of a faery outfit). I would've voted 4/5 stars, except that I have never found a brand that truly caters to women of ALL sizes.
B0036OS6KS|5|Good for the price.<br /><br />As to the 2 major complaints I've seen:<br /><br />Pockets too deep - I don't see it, they are about the same as a more expensive pair I have.<br /><br />Too sheer - I bought black, blue and red. I think the people complaining may have been sold knock offs. Shorts are lined with an opaque lining the same color as the outer layer. They do not seem to be sheer at all. Note that the outer layer without the lining would be pretty sheer.<br /><br />I have not had them long enough to speak to longevity.
B000UZRCTC|5|This bra fits nicely and without any weird shapes or gaps in the cup. It's soft, simple, and functional, which is what i was wanting. The straps are comfortable and don't dig into my shoulders and the band doesn't roll like a lot of the ones with only two hooks do.
B005NDWQWY|4|Fits as expected but allow for shrinking after drying.
B00IZ61MQC|1|Everything was perfect until.... I tried them on only to find out one of the padding were sunk inward instead of protecting/ covering my nipples. Had to order a replacement n that was fine
B006QZC6JG|5|This is a real nice hat.  Does what I wanted to buy it for. Too bad it is made in China.
B002E6LPU2|4|These suit our need of a costume type item for our photo area at a nautical themed prom.  They are as pictured and will survive several people taking them on and off.
B00LY6A3T2|1|To small
B007WAFBO6|4|The sweater is really good and not very expensive at all. I'm quite small, so I often have the problem that clothes are too big for me, but this fitted just perfectly. I'm about 5ft tall and really thin, so it might not be for everyone, it is petite.<br /><br />The fabric is really nice and soft and the confection is really good. The only thing that was not as I have pictured it was that, since it's fabric is strech, the sleeve does not fall as naturally as it does in the photo. You have to pull it down yorself, and whenever you move your arms up a little it will come up again.<br /><br />Overall it is really good quality for its price.
B00XEM6A6O|5|Just as pictured! This is my second Element Backpack that I brought for my teenager son. He loves it!
B00D6T4RNI|5|I just got this today and i love it! The cat looks exactly like my girl raven! The design is soft not some cheap iron-on stuff. Very soft fabric sized well and the v-neck is flattering. Anyone who loves black cats like i do would adore this!
B00NU4SKQY|4|nice....
B00JS51YEY|4|Cool tshirt
B00DDCNTJQ|4|Really like the fit of this shirt, the light material for summer and the 3 colors in it.
B00N1YNVYE|5|As advertised. Keeps my neck and face warm. Looks cool doing it.
B002ZLOIIW|4|This is a review for Haggar Men;s Repreve Stria Hidden Waistband.<br /><br />I used these pants for the first 3 years of my working life.  I would wear em until they faded out, throw em out, and buy another pair.  Costco used to have them, but switched to a different style.  Typically, I can find em for $19.99 a pair so it was a great deal.<br /><br />Pros<br />Cheap<br />Look Great<br />Feel Great<br />No Wrinkles.  Throw in dryer for 5 minutes and hang.<br />EXPANDABLE WAISTBAND = BREATHABILITY<br /><br />Cons<br />Doesn't look or feel like Italian Wool<br />Haggar started making them with shorter pockets.  Stuff would slide out of my pocket constantly when I would sit down.<br /><br />Much better than Dockers or other cheap khakis out there.  But, I still think you should upgrade to full Italian Wool to be the ultimate professional.
B00F3VNLKC|4|Good fit on neck and sleeves but a bit short in the tails. Better than paying twice as much in a big and tall shop.
B00NNIY2CI|5|38c fits a tiny bit small but enough to keep everything in place and look cute in the back. Still comfy.
B000E0ZBQY|5|This is the most comfortable longline bra I've ever worn.<br />And I've worn alot throughout the years. It makes me feel secure.
B0000ZFSFW|5|The order arrived on time, the right size, and is something I have worn since I have had vein surgery.  The hose are very comfortable.
B002Q0QYIE|4|My girl Likes these, and she is very cute in them.  She says they are very warm and the sizing seems spot on.  The velcro on the back flap should go all the way around though in my opinion.
B005047R8E|4|Had an old pair of similar overalls for eons.  They are about to fall apart.  Tried the \\"Carpenter\\" version for more tool capacity.  The overalls are great...a little stiff of course, but a good fit. One suggestion for Carhartt would be to make the extra carpenter tool pockets detachable.  I'll let you know in a couple years if these last as long as my original pair.
B00HXA0C9O|5|I bought these in several different colors at the Carters store, and they are great. I love the bright colors, and they wear well and fit well. The waist is adjustable, and they seem true-to-size. The price here is about the same as what I paid, and is much better than comparable pants in other brands.  (Boden, for example makes similar pants which are also great, but twice the price.)
B009H8SP3A|5|Great product, fast shipping....works well, so far so good, still too new to know for sure!<br /><br />Update: product worked really well, no major complaints!
B005CSOS5I|5|My Husband Loved it
B00K6LVDUE|5|What can I saw, it's FROZEN.
B008J4ZWCK|5|SUPER
B00MYGRBOQ|5|Dress is beautiful.
B0072DEQ44|4|The wallet looks good, has a lot of space for the cards. My only problem with this is the smell it has.
B00MBB9BNS|5|My daughter wore it for her homecoming dance (late review) and she looked like a princess.  I had to get it altered to her size but i expected to do so as she is 11 and very tall and skinny. Dress came in sooner then expected.  Great purchase,  great price!
B000MN9K4M|5|Very nice
B00L3R5L1M|5|My boys gave this shirt to their Dad - a huge Star Wars fan. He was absolutely tickled and put it on immediately.  Looks and feels terrific!
B003KIW8B8|3|Glasses arrived and were broke but called and they immediately sent a new pair out to me within days of calling them
B005CSOGFA|1|really cheap fabric .cheap  for cheap price. after washing and drying  I will give it to the Goodwill.  Waste of money.
B00GM1DWCO|5|I'm 5'9 and the medium fit good. The quality is terrific and their customer service is superb.
B00XJ1DZNG|5|very good. I bought it for my daughters party and they loved it. #ThumbsUp
B00CYAVMQU|2|When I first got the shirt it fit perfectly, after one wash in cold water the length shrunk. Not so much that it can't be worn but it definitely doesn't look like it did when it first arrived. Color is true and fabric is moderately heavy ...good for mild weather.
B007T9H2E2|5|To be honest... I typically hate panties ... But with being pregnant I needed some support and these are awesome!! So coming from a pantie hater, that's a big deal lol
B008LMFA8Q|5|Excellent product! Ignore negative reviews!!
B00C1XQVMK|1|WTF? I ordered a size small but it feels like I am wearing a large. Material feels great though. Wished they made an XXS = Small
B001V1570A|3|As usual, their German translation is a bit off.  It's kind of a rude way to say &#34;shut up&#34; &#34;Halt deine schnauze&#34;  translates as &#34;Hold your snout&#34;  Kind of implies that the person it's aimed at is talking non-stop like a little yapping dog...
B007P5ZIF0|4|I love this jacket.  It feels like i am wrapped in a nice comforting blanket.<br /><br />My only complaint is, in the photo it looks like the arms are extra long, but they are actually too short.  By my own admission i have unusually long arms, but i was still surprised at how the arms didn't fit.  I am 68&#34; tall and my wing span is 71&#34;.<br /><br />Everything else is wonderful, the material is soft and warm.  The color is spot on to the photo.  The pockets are extra big (this should make up for the shorter sleeves.), and the body length fits nicely.<br /><br />I can't wait for it to be cold in 2 days i can wear it to work!!
B00IXLN3E8|4|Good looking, and price for that shirt.
B00EI8GGIU|2|ran bit smaller than the pic demonstrated
B005FPD2A0|4|I ordered these gloves because it's winter and cold. We do a lot of outdoor activities for Halloween and Christmas and now that it's colder I didn't want to have to keep taking off a glove every time I wanted to snap a picture. These gloves are ok for the smart touch feature, not great though. It's still easier to just take a glove off, but they do the job. You have to have the glove tip in exactly the right position, and mine tends to keep moving over to the side. If you just want a normal pair of gloves, these are great and they fit great. I would buy them again just for a pair of gloves that I like, but not for the smart touch feature.
B00ABBPDPU|5|Great winter socks for the kids. Can't find good kids socks like this in many stores other than REI and these are much cheaper.
B001LM5WQ8|5|Okay, time for a review from a big girl!  At size 3X, I was obviously wary.  It preached miracles and had pictures of women wearing it that I wouldn't normally associate with actually needing something like this.  But hey, I do like miracles so why not?<br /><br />I bought this not with the expectation of looking like a swimsuit model, but rather with the hope of smoothing out some of the lumpy bits...and as large as I am, those lumps are practically humps.  While I'm a 3X, I'm so worried about my various lumps and bumps that I tend to buy 4X and 5X clothing so that I can be positive it won't stick in unflattering ways, which leads me to look like I'm wearing giant pillowcases most of the time.<br /><br />I've had this product about two hours now and I can say it's marvelously comfortable. I can move and bend in it, and although movement is stiff it's not restricted - it's just very stringy.  It's almost like doing very lightweight crunches when you try to bend.  It immediately smoothed my lines out and I feel confident wearing this 3X shirt that's more flattering to my figure (I DO have a figure, you know...it's just more of a day glass than an hour glass  :P ).<br /><br />All in all, this item is wonderful and I'll be buying more in the future.  I purchased a 4X and it's roomer than expected, so I'll definitely go with my actual size when buying the next one.  Forget looking 'skinnier' - this item is not THAT miraculous.  But it does make your shape more flattering and allows clothing to fall on your frame in a much more flattering manner.<br /><br />Not hot, not breath-restricting. A slight rubbery smell but not overpowering and it surely goes away with a bit of use.  This product is fantastic and I cannot recommend it enough - it even improves posture and keeps my back straight with no effort or discomfort!  The bottom DOES roll up when I sit down, however it pops back into place when I stand and I think that if I put the top of my pantyhose over it it won't do that.that.
B00IC61IEG|4|Material was decent quality with good thickness.  Usually fan shirts seem to be made of the cheapest, thinnest material.
B00OJ4O2ZM|1|Lol who goes to the store with just a thong and nothing else? 😂 I hope he's joking! 😂
B0034S51SQ|5|It's a super cute necklace and the pendant isn't as thin as I was afraid it would be. I'd definitely recommend it.
B00AR5IJFG|4|The snap broke within a few days, but overall, everything has been good with this. Would recommend, just be careful when opening the wallet with the snap.
B00FBQP472|5|This product is excellent. if you are looking for quality for the money. then buy with confidence. Love this product.
B003OCR23E|5|Very Nice tie!
B00J3PZK2Q|4|Very cute. Looks exactly as it does in pic. I bought a medium and it fits like a large or XL. Sooo if you a medium I would recommend a small
B0041RR6XM|4|I purchased this jacket with the intention of using it as a wind-breaker/spring riding jacket.  That said I'm very pleased with the overall quality of the jacket.  It does however fit a little snug compared to what I was expecting given my experience with other Puma jackets.
B00U09U2I6|5|I like it to wear at hot yoga class
B00B8Y2WIU|5|Nice quality tee. I love it.
B007SLD3MG|5|super soft material! fits as expected.
B00BPC00V6|5|These shoes were such a great buy. They are cute with everything and very comfortable
B00BLYQL2K|4|I liked the material and the fact that it fits just right.  I would definitely buy another.  Nevertheless, I did not find much of a variety with regards to having bright colors.  That I would love to see.
B00573PRFS|5|Great shirt, arrived promptly. It fits well and the fabric is durable and comfortable. Would definitely recommend to fans of ATDI.
B001GG3DVA|3|Cashmere isn't too impressive, but they will do.
B00JGI9UBW|2|Very sexy  swimsuit. Offers coverage but remains feminine , allows you to feel good about yourself and confident . Winner for me
B002YQ2G5A|5|They feel comfy and they also won't snag as easily as other tights I have gotten. However, with the ultra shimmery-ness of the tights I do feel at times like a roller derby girl and oftentimes that really isn't the look I'm going for, so I have to be careful where I wear them and with what. But they are great, this brand is GREAT!
B00T894RZI|5|Love this top it fits perfect
B003P2VI8I|5|I have found Le Mystere bras to be an excellent fit for my figure and this strapless bra is no exception. I needed a strapless bra in a hurry to wear to a wedding so I just ordered my usual size and was thrilled to find that this style was true to size and fit perfectly. I am very pleased with this bra. It was comfortable to wear for a long day and stayed in place without the optional straps. I will continue to purchase this brand in various styles. These bras may cost more than your typical discount store brands, but they are worth it, especially if you wear an unusual size that is difficult to find in a store.
B00BLA2HMM|4|My bad. I am losing weight and guessed too small. Will keep them for when they fit and order one size larger shortly.
B00E1ZPKXC|4|Nice and soft.  Covers well.
B00I7ULCN4|5|I love these bras. They fit great and I never have to worry about the straps falling off my shoulders.
B00330SXXA|5|Up to this point, I'd been using my regular bras to work out, and it annoyed me that the straps kept falling down my shoulder, so I decided to finally buy some sport bras. Since I try to work out 4 days a week, I was very happy to find a three-pack for such a great price.    These bras are fantastic! They fit true to size, and they stay in place for the entire work out. I also found them supportive for a moderately sized chest. They fit pretty comfortably under a tank top. It was an excellent purchase and I definitely recommend them.
B00LLIVQL2|2|Rolls up when I move, can only wear it to bed due to the fact it rolls up when ever I move
B00847O9LM|4|you know the ones!<br /><br />We buy those skirts, but those skirts are often flimsy so we need some material to keep them from blowing around, you know what I mean girls.
B00ZDV1SG6|5|This hoodie was a purchase that was made for my significant other's birthday.  He loved it and it fits him well.  The inside of the hoodie is super soft and very comfortable.  Money well spent.
B00SUODAL4|4|Great Shirt!
B007LM191E|5|Love the subtle allure this cloche gives an outfit.  Brings back a romanticism that is often lost in today's clothing lines.
B00NU8UBNU|5|It was perfect! Just what my husband has always wanted to see me in.
B00BV2R5K4|1|I will be sending this back at the end of the month, Amazon sent me a size medium when I purchased a XL. not impressed. one star
B00KDY4R1G|3|size 6 rather small, but still OK
B005H0SZC8|4|This the second steve madden that I have bought this year . It fits right and for a non down jacket it's pretty warm . Big pockets for my belongings , and it looks good . Who said this dude just makes shoes ? Money !!
B000TFQOGK|5|Gave a 5 star rating because.....this is a good quality light weight jacket at a great price.  Good for fall and early spring.  Order a medium and fit was good on hubby. Well worth the money
B00A1XQCF8|4|Great I love it will buy again
B006VOV27O|5|These are the greatest jeans, just follow all my curves, size 18 and all, fit perfectly. Not like some other jeans that go up to your chin. They haven't stretched out at all, no bagging at knee. sturdy and just what I wanted, Thank you.
B00T4FYPXA|5|This product is exactly what I was looking for. A quality satin robe that falls mid-calf.
B00IRZ3WRS|5|Dress was a bit snug, but not enough to be uncomfortable. I was surprised by the quality, it's a really nice dress, and it shipped very fast! I can't wait to wear it, great buy.
B003HC8RXK|5|very comfortable socks. I ordered the larger size because I wanted the better fit for me. fit perfect. will order again. would recommend to others in doubt about ordering them.
B000WNLH52|5|I wanted a tiara that was not too gaudy, expensive, or cheaply made for my daughters communion. This was perfect! Excellent quality for the price and exactly what I was looking for. Very happy with my purchase.
B00579UKAE|4|Nice shirt, fits well at XL size.  The only thing that I don't like about it is the Russel brand name on the sleeve.
B00LMI9A6Y|5|I love them. Perfect to show off your body.  The high waistband is super flattering and improves curves.  They are warm but not too warm and enough to wear as pants in fall/winter.
B00DR4WTHI|4|Not quite as soft as expected but still plenty comfortable.  Could be a bit more bold in the print but love the color way.  My daughter gave it to her friend as a gift and she is enjoying it.
B00BXP1PUU|4|Pockets would be nice
B00WE7U1M4|2|Size is smaller then number size
B004VQBISW|5|They are a bit tight right at first but they'll stretch a small amount. Fairly low rise, form fitting but don't look like skinny pants.
B002MSGT5S|5|This wig is being used for my son to go to Akon as Fezzik from Princess Bride.  It looks amazingly like Andre The Giant and we are very pleased.
B00HRHN7AO|4|I was pretty skeptical buying something that had no reviews, but Im so glad I did! I am a very thin lady ( 5'5, 110 pounds) and I got the small, and it fit like a glove! It also enhances my bust which is awesome! I cant wait until they get more in stock so I can order again!
B00C2N7WK4|3|I liked the jackets, except that I thought the arms were made out of plastic, instead they are made out of cloth, witch is going to be very hard to keep clean
B0073E589O|4|It's a decent costume but I was a bit upset that the sleeves are t shirt sleeves and show half my arm even with the gloves on.
B00KD5BET8|5|Amazingly soft, multipurpose, super absorbent for burp clothes.  The colors are great and vibrant!
B0046EDNM8|5|Kenneth Cole Dark Indigo, Straight Cut, 34x34<br /><br />My waist size is more of a 33, but the problem with me wearing the exact waist size is that it tends to be tight as I wear them. The jeans either shrink a little or I gain a few pounds. The inseam is spot on with the Kenneth Cole jeans, and the waist is a little short but the size is comfortable. I can never seem to find a right pair of jeans locally. They're either designed for larger folks (relaxed fit), or they don't have my size, or they cost 3-5 times too much.<br /><br />The color pattern is sharp and contemporary, and the straight cut is perfect for my thighs. A slim cut would probably be more suited for my calves, but it would also look a bit too faddish.<br /><br />The pockets are comfortable, and it uses a YKK zipper for the fly. The rivets stick out too much, and the Kenneth Cole metal emblem riveted into the corner of the change pocket gets irritating at times when I put my hand into the pocket.<br /><br />The Kenneth Cole rubber/plastic label on the back seems cheap and flimsy. They should have stuck to something similar to what Levi and other brands use for their jean labels, but it works well enough.<br /><br />The material is fairly light weight and thin. I don't recommend using these as actual work jeans. They're more for casual wear in an office setting or for casual events.<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars
B0076KZ8ZY|4|I really wanted to give these 5 stars.  However, they are uncomfortable starchy & tight.  I'm 6'1 tall dark & handsome with a 33 inch waist so bought a large because some of the reviews said get a size up.  I must say don't let this stop you from buying these- they are well made just consider getting two sizes up ... Seriously.  Additionally, Like all of their underwear I've bought they look great.
B00FDHS3OA|5|My son loves garbage trucks- when I saw this shirt, I had to get it. The shirt is soft and runs true to size.  Not a big 4t nor a small 4t
B003MWCOLG|4|I have prostate cancer and my feet swell up. Dr. Scholl's socks are fine except they're not large enough even though my shoe size is only 10  3E.
B004PEI4GY|5|My daughter just turned 3. She is average size. Fit perfect with grow room as expected by the span in size  -- 2 - 6x. Very nice quality!!
B004QF0TG0|5|I love these socks
B008MDZNOA|1|The back of this bandana says &#34;Kingdom of Jordan&#34; in large letters.  This item is misrepresented on the website.  I will never deal with this seller again, and I recommend that everyone stay away from this type of misleading listing.
B00UJUNQF2|2|Shrunk real bad. to small to fix my Husband so now I get to wear it.
B00LGKMEWK|5|Beautiful
B000WU4XAQ|3|I agree with the previous reviewer that this isn't the best quality costume, but it sure is cute.  We had a Caddyshack theme party and decided to dress up our five month old son as a gopher.  It was a hot summer day so we only used the head portion of the costumue, but it didn't seem to irritate him at all and it was quite adorable.  Basically this costume gets the job done.
B006KXVK96|5|These were excellent for my daughter and perfect for the fall. The colors match everything in my baby girls wardrobe and they are very soft.
B001DXQZ2U|5|They are traditional dickies, what more is to be said. If you want pants you will have for 10-20 years++, these are the pants for you. I saw rambo walking down the street in a pair of these last week.<br /><br />They are nice because they can be work pants, casual pants, and even dress pants if you're daring. I got hit by a truck in these pants, and they held up the crash, but where destroyed when the EMT's cut them off, so scissors/knives may cut them, but not easily.<br /><br />Initially these pants are a bit stiff, but a few washes and a few hard working days breaks them in nicely. Once the pants are broken in they are the most comfortable, durable pants you will find.<br />God Bless.
B009G4P11O|5|This hat fit my dad great.  To bad it doesn't make the Bears play better :)
B0012N38AI|5|I have been wearing this style of bra for many years. I try new styles every few years, but always come back to this one. For some reason, it just fits me the best, is comfortable, lasts a long, long time, great value. I like the lightly lined cups for modesty, the underwire is comfortable. Does not flatten me like the other reviewer said.
B00GOYFTHA|5|If you are on the fence like I was I can truly say it is worth it. I wear it 4-5 days a week working in a kitchen and the belt shows little to no wear after months of usage. Fantastic belt. I don't think this one will fray like others I had it is crafted very well.
B0000ZDSSG|5|Super Bra! Pretty and Great Price!
B004RJQ0PO|2|As soon I open the box and tried to open the wallet, the little tab that you push to spring the wallet open, broke off. Because it is such a small piece, it can't be repaired.
B0086TYRGA|5|I am an odd shape and these fit perfect.  Heavy duty everything...fabric, zippers, pocket liners.  These are made for work.  I couldn't imagine a product better than these.
B004SM6GWC|5|Love Everything About it!  Small, Quality, Durable and Sexy.  I have been looking for while and I'm very happy.  Go get one!
B00A352BDG|3|It's very baggy I should have ordered 1 size down, otherwise comfortable as the fabric is soft and slightly stretchy.
B00O2L0HT2|2|Pretty sure this is a fake! The only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is because I like it. Just hope it doesn't fall apart after a few washes.
B005WUPQNY|4|Cute!
B00DPHNM8M|5|Adorable perfect fit for my toddler!
B009ZZ7L08|5|I gave this to the father-to-be and he wore it to the co-ed baby shower.  He was a proud papa!
B006CAZFGG|4|I am super happy with this top!  Color is true and embellishment tasteful.  I normally wear an XL and this fits perfectly - it's stretch material but not overly clingy.  It feels just great.  Now I'm wishing for other colors!
B0091JE7UU|1|These pajamas were awful! The outer leg seam ripped from the hip all the way past my knee on the first wearing. Also they aren't brushed cotton backed and are sweaty. Don't waste the money!
B00O4D51L2|1|Had a horrible smell and fit weird
B008KE4VTO|5|This is my new favorite shirt!! I ordered a few more but I did size down to a medium. The large was a tad big around the neck for me. With it being a dolman sleeve it is cut differently then a regular T-shirt. So it's a personal preference as to how you like it to fit. The material is super soft and comfortable!! GREAT buy!!
B004QYM9JQ|3|These shirts seem to be made from regular cotton knit.  The neckline is a little small, the sleeves are a little long, and it's a little short in the vertical length.  They were inexpensive enough to purchase to wear fishing and get blood and guts all over them without worrying about how much you paid for them, but I'm not certain they are truly adequate in the SPF sector. If you want an SPF shirt that truly looks nice and wears really well, I would suggest Coolibar.
B00ATVHMY2|3|Sizing is a bit on the small side, but they are made in China. Normally wear XL. Glad I did not order XL. XXL are even snug
B002T00GDU|5|Really works. Is gentle on the head and these are the only visors I own that don't give me headaches.
B0064KTZTW|2|I did not like. I have always bought size 34. Although I use it, this time the belt is too short.
B0036VP910|4|I had initially thought that the price was too high for a costume that I would likely wear only once - but after comparing with cheaper gypsy costumes, I found that this one was definitely superior.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Arrived in a garment bag with a hanger<br />- Lots of pieces that make up a great costume, and most of them were separate (except for one - see CONS below)<br />- Quality material, especially the turquoise skirt overlay which has gold thread accents, and the skirt itself which also has a petticoat underneath<br />- Came with tarot cards (I didn't use them but other people might find them useful)<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The bodice and the turquoise skirt overlay were attached together, so they can't be worn separately<br />- The bodice was also closer to a pale yellow in color, not cream like I was expecting<br /><br />Instead of the red scarves I used a belly dancer scarf with gold coins that I already had, and bought a cheap gold jewelry set from Party City to accessorize. I wore it to Renaissance Faire where people are usually picky about clothing and received several compliments. Overall very happy with this costume, and might even wear it again next year!
B00MY0HP52|5|Good fit, well made, soft and comfortable.
B00A0GGKJ4|5|Me and a friend bought two of these.  Once we got them, we were shocked how creepy/disturbing they were (WAY more than the pictures online indicate).  Yes, they smell like Texas when you put them on for the first time (wild west range and hydrocarbons), but letting them air out on a coat hanger over time fixes this.  One of the best investments we had ever made!
B00BVZZRZ6|3|Great for Cosplay!<br />___________________<br />Positives: The actual costume looks very nice and very much like the real one on the show. It is very comfortable and warm. The hood fits nicely to anyone.<br />___________________<br /><br />Negatives:<br />I had to increase my measurements because it was a little small. Also, the quiver was very hard to figure out how to put on, as it is very different from others. The part of the quiver that holds the strap broke off and I had to improvise and jerry rig it to a preferable placement. The hood comes as another part and when you put it on, the flaps on the front like to come up and to the side and move around and it is very annoying. The legs looked baggy, so I requested that they tailor that as well, but I don't think they will.<br />__________<br /><br />I might be forgetting some positives but overall it looks very nice although there are a lot of difficulties I faced, maybe it was just mine that was like that judging from other comments. Definitely buy this but take into account some of the difficulties I faced.
B005J46MIG|5|Good product - love the colors & the frilly design on the sole. My geriatric patients wear these all the time so I know good quality when I see it! Has helped prevent many a fall!
B00O2TXIK4|4|I purchased two pairs of these slippers in two sizes as my daughter's feet are continually growing. She is a BIG Hello Kitty fanatic and loves her slippers. My only gripe is the stitching on the bottom that hold the sole to the boot is very shoddy. She has only worn this newest pair 5 days and the stitching is coming undone. You get what you pay for, and since these were so cheap to begin with I suppose the shoddy workmanship should be expected.
B0007YR994|5|I have been looking for a good fitting bra for a long time.  I finally found it.  The fit is great, straps do not slip and it is comfortable to wear all day.  I would recommend this bra to anyone.
B000LDQ2QW|5|A fantastic piece. Great wearability and versatility. It worked well for a Rocky Horror costume, held up through 10 shows and beyond. Would purchase again!
B004AMG8P0|5|I fit was great and the colors are as vibrant as shown.  It was a wonderful pajama set.  I could not be happier
B000O7ITXO|5|excellent quality.
B000W4524I|5|The cloak looked just as it was pictured! It was long, but I had read in the previous reviews that that was the case. I wore it to a Mardi Gras-themed event, so it was harder to maneuver in because I also wore a mask and worked at not stepping on it.  It was also warmer than I had anticipated, but that was a good thing because I had on a sleeveless gown.<br />I am going to wear it again for a gala this weekend with a different gown.<br /> I'm very happy with my purchase and recommend it to other potential buyers.
B00M238DCK|5|These shorts fit my daughter perfectly! Its the perfect material & washes very well too.<br />It;s not to thick or bulky that it looks weird with a skirt on top of it.<br />Definitely recommend these shorts!
B0026RHF1C|5|this is my FAVORITE piece I've bought in a really long time, material is nice & I chose the correct size, nothing is too tight or too loose. I'm 5'2&#34; 122lb & got a M, all body shapes are different but for me, this was perfect. love love love :)
B00GIIIU8W|5|They are nice and soft my Son loves them and the Colors.
B002YX07V8|3|I love the way this looks, I always like stripes and the nautical theme of this item, but if you are more than a C cup be warned it makes you look even larger! There is very little real support and the horizontal stripes widen you. But if you're a C or have implants that make you perkier, it will be fine (but if you have any pendulosity, as I do -- probably avoid it!).
B00GPDUXKI|4|Nice jacket, just disappointed there was no fur in the sleeves. Thought the coat would be a little thicker.
B0020HA45W|5|Nice hat, fits fine, looks great!
B005ZWVGCO|4|They fit well but they are darker than what was shown in the image. They are more a hunter green
B00JHBQV2E|5|A like
B00B1FU8SC|3|Shrank within first wash =/ but nice shirt
B00PXZSZUO|5|4'10&#34;, 97lbs, got a size 4, didn't have to make any adjustments. It fit perfect. It comes a little crinkled but it's an easy enough fix. Throw it in the dryer on high heat with some wet towels for an hour and they're mostly gone. I bought it as a bridesmaid dress, so two other girls bought one as well. They said they had trouble keeping the black part under the sheer breast covering to stay up. They're quite a bit bigger busted than me, so that could be the reason? I didn't have any trouble with that. It was a gorgeous dress! It rivaled the bride's gown. ;) Also is arrived on time and was true to color! (At least I can vouch for blue.)
B009GES3L4|5|She loves it!
B003UMPYU6|5|GREAT support and comfort.  This is my favorite bra of all time.  I have gone back for several more.  It gives great lift and is perfectly seemless.
B004XH6848|5|Apearently it runs a couple sizes too big, cause this thing just swims on me. Can't complain though, does the job great.
B002Q5YCXI|4|Lovely denim overalls. Son wore it often, until it grew out of size. Comfortable, not hard. To him go any T-shirts and sweaters. I'm happy. Now it is the boy next door. Gave as good as new
B0096GO29E|5|This was perfect because it helped reduce the size of my old big bulky trifold and the money clip is nice and strong so I'm looking not worried about dropping money
B00JG3R0YQ|2|I use this dress for a night gown due to it being very see through.
B00KQTQZOU|2|Cut too small
B0085IH07U|5|My dad loves his pants
B001JBH16A|5|I like them, just wish I could choose the colors. Mine were: gray, navy blue, teal/aqua, purple, and red.
B00W9BJ26Q|5|love love this dress!!! fits well with good material... hugs where it should (i am long waisted) and not too snug on the backside!
B00MA79VPQ|4|A little bigger than expected but comfy.
B005PNNFUO|5|Poppin
B00BX9MKZU|5|excelent
B0045DKB7U|4|i used it as an idea for my tux i wore at my wedding but in white with red and white top hat and white skull topped cane
B009S0S74E|4|I bought them to ear with my nursing scrubs just for fun.  I wear a size 8 shoe and they fit well.  I think they would cramp your toes if you had a shoe sizer than a 9.
B00GY1WBWE|4|acceptable
B00FW7XCM4|5|Excelente producto!!!
B00ELCXDXY|5|I like this company a lot..they even gave me a free shorty pants as a gift
B00UCHUJVQ|5|I love this color. And I love swim dresses. They cover some places that's not so pretty. But they make you look nice and trim. Great fit<br />cheaper than the mall to. Will buy another one.
B00GP3KGZA|5|Birthday present for myself, love it
B005TCBTIQ|5|It is shorter than we expected from the pictures (shorter sleeves, too) but my daughter loves it, and the large should fit her at least another year. Those darn growth spurts.
B00AMRR12G|2|One size too small
B00HJZL7FG|5|Gives a nice shape
B00SKA3MXE|5|Cute
B002VLZH5Y|5|I purchased this for working out at the gym.  This is a thick cotton so it doesn't wear out easily.  The sewing is good quality and an overall good product.  They are much less expensive than similar nike, adidas, and reebock items.
B005FVQUK8|5|I ordered these already knowing that Vanity Fair fit me fairly well. I have been unable to find bras that are a perfect fit, but these are pretty close. Within several days they arrived in perfect condition. I didn't expect them to arrive without a box, but I understand it's easier to ship that way. Very happy all around.
B00MKDS7CI|5|Live them so much<br />Exact ones from the park
B00EDTM0LG|4|I like these but they do run a little big.  They don't shrink when put in the dryer.
B00A73XFSO|2|they're ok for the price, but man are they cheap.  Some of the other reviews talked about them being too stiff so I was hopeful that they'd last or possibly be made of leather.  They're made of some synthetic cheap material that was scratched before I took it out of the box.  Now a week later it's finish is flaking off where the belt goes through the buckle.  I wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't buy it again.
B00BLUJQ6C|1|Very sneaky size!<br />Too small, my wife's size is petite and this skirt was super tight as size in small.
B00JH2F55C|5|I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It fit perfectly and he likes the quality of the material. It was my biggest concern. He won't wear flimsy or poorly made T-shirts.
B000FGU8OC|5|Loved it.
B00OC6XYME|5|I love my dress. It was so cool and comfy and I received lots of compliments. The pockets were a plus
