B0008KLVG4|4.0|When \\"Jaws\\" was released on DVD five years ago, the package skimped on extras, provided a whittled-down version of an originally two-hour documentary, and scrapped the original, Oscar-winning sound mix in favor of a surround-sound modernization that was often less effective than what moviegoers heard circa-1975. There was an online petition a few years ago signed by many ardent \\"Jaws\\" fans (a/k/a finsters) calling for a better DVD issue. I'm one of the \\"Jaws\\" geeks who signed that petition, and this DVD set is for us.<br /><br />Anyone buying \\"Jaws\\" on DVD for the first time with this set will get a choice of the original monoraul mix, or DTS or Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mixes (both of which include some cheesy new sound effects not heard in the original) along with the full-length documentary originally produced for the 1995 laserdisc edition, and some additional extras. Still not as many extras as there could have been, but this set is more generous in that regard than the 2000 release. Picture quality is identical to the earlier DVD, which looked fine for the most part. Finsters naturally will opt for the mono soundtrack and sit through the entire documentary, reveling in the story of one of the most problem-plagued Hollywood productions ever. DVD consumers with less of an emotional attachment to the movie will question the need to invest in this package over the one-disc DVD from 2000, and I can't say I blame them.<br /><br />Whichever DVD you buy,  though (and stick with the letterboxed version, please--panning-and-scanning wrecks the movie's visual coherence), \\"Jaws\\" has long since become an inadvertent classic, with at least two of its best characteristics--Steven Spielberg's emphasis on implied threat rather than overexposure of the giant shark, and the lead actors' nuanced performances--forced on it by the endless special-effects delays. Summertime blockbusters, of which this was the first, have improved on the effects since then but have generally declined in storytelling ability compared to this.
6300182282|5.0|If you are lucky, just once, you will see a film that will stay with you FOREVER. I was traveling with my best friend when we were just 16 and we came across the Heritage House on the coast of California in Little River. That is when I learned of the film \\"Same Time, Next Year\\" as it was filmed there. I have travelled the world since 1980 and visited many romantic places, been married and divorced and married and divorced and now in love again but this movie and that place will forever hold the MOST romantic place in my heart. The movie is funny and sad and just wonderful. There are two types of people in this world...Those that have seen this film and, sadly, those that have not.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|After a brilliant debut, they come up with even a better album. But the stupid critics had to trash it because it didn't contain a \\"Sultans of Swing\\". Wich caused the dramatic line up change after this album. And they lost the great sound if you ask me. They would   <br />lose one guitar, and replace it with stupid keyboards. Giving the Critics and MTV what they want. Yuck. Every album after Communique would just get worse and worse. (although I like the soundscape of \\"private investigations\\" and the song \\"Brothers in arms\\" NOT the album). <br /> <br />This album is truly their best. It has my favourite Dire Straits song \\"Where do you think you're going\\", wich is really damn catchy. \\"News\\" is another brilliant song.  <br />I like the fact that this album didn't contain any radio hits, it makes you judge it for the music itself, wich is beautiful
B00008H2LB|5.0|This Linkin Park Meteora CD is ONE OF THE BEST EVER!!!!!!! I LOVE to listen to this CD! LINKIN PARK IS AN AWESOME BAND!! I will give reviews and ratings for each song. <br /> <br />01. Foreword- This isn't even a song.It's just a 13 second opening with rain falling and glass breaking. It sounds like it should be the start of Don't Stay. I won't rate this song. <br /> <br />02. Don't Stay- Not one of my favorite Linkin Park songs but it's a fun opening song. This is one of the few Linkin Park songs that doesn't have a hip-hop beat to it.(9th favorite of twelve). I like this song because of it's similarity to From The Inside. 7/10. <br /> <br />03. Somewhere I Belong- This song is one of my favorite Linkin Park songs! This song is about Where do I Belong. The start of the song sounds like the bridge of In The End. This is the sequel to In The End though I like In the End better. (3rd favorite of twelve). 9/10. <br /> <br />04. Lyin' My way From You- Another cool song by linkin Park! Chester Bennington screams really loud in this track with a rockin' hip-hop beat to it. (5th favorite of twelve). 8/10 <br /> <br />05. Hit The Floor-  This is also a cool song by Linkin Park! A hip-hop bounce with somewhat heavy metal with a really dark sound. (8th favorite of twelve). 7/10. <br /> <br />06. Easier To Run- Of all of the Linkin Park lyrical songs this is my least favorite. The sample of it is kinda boring. It's a sequel to Crawling, but I think that is TOTTALLY WRONG!!! (11th favorite of twelve). 6/10. <br /> <br />07. FAINT- THIS SONG IS TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is my favorite Linkin Park song!!!!!!!!!!! A cool fast beat with an XXXTREME guitar !!!!!!!!!!  It will make you faint after you hear it! (Favorite of twelve)! I love how Chester sings \\" I CAN'T FEEL, THE WAY I DID BEFORE. DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON ME\\"!! 1,000/10. <br /> <br />08. Figure.09- This loud headbangin' song is another one of my top songs on this CD, though it's not one of their hit songs.I don't get the name of this song and Points of Authority. It is a sequel to By Myself. (6th of twelve) 8/10.  <br /> <br />09. Breaking The Habit- One of my top Linkin Park songs. It sounds strange to have this song on Meteora. It sounds like it should be on Hybrid Theory. the music video is unbelievable. (4th of twelve). 9/10. <br /> <br />10. From the Inside- This kinda sounds like a cross between Breaking The Habit and Figure.09. It has a preety cool beat to it. (7th of twelve). 7/10. <br /> <br />11. No body's Listening- I'm not too much of a hip-hop fan, but I thought it was really cool the way how Linkin Park did it. The Japanese flute gives it a really heavy Asian sound. (10th favorite of 12). 6/10. <br /> <br />12.Session- No lyrics just an instrumental song. (least favorite song of twelve). 4/10. <br /> <br />13. Numb- This is definiteley one of my favorite Linkin Park songs! It sounds like the perfect song to close off the CD with. (2nd favorite of twelve). 10/10. <br /> <br />That's it for my reviews. As the sums add up  it's an awesome CD! If you're a Linkin Park fan who doesn't have Meteora, you MUST get it!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
B00004Y6NW|4.0|First off, Im not really a Dire Straits fan. This is because I basically only like their first two albums. <br />Later on they would get to MTV for my tastes. <br />This Dire straits debut is a fine album. All the songs rock, and they sound anything but commercial. except maybe for \\"Sultans of swing\\" but then only because the airplay, the song itself rocks. <br />It starts off great with \\"Down on the Waterline\\", and \\"Water of Life\\" is beautiful. So are all the songs here. Because both Knopflers where playing here, you can hear TWO guitars !(the sound I miss in all the albums after Communique].
B000059HAI|5.0|Unlike the mediocre and Disneyfied 'Pearl Harbor' with its cheesy love story and splashy special effects, Tora! Tora! Tora! actually has the feel that you are reliving history. The drama of the moment when the United States is dragged into World War II does not need embellishment, and the filmmakers here are wise in their use of restraint. You are struck by the missed clues that doomed thousands, the all-too-slow teletypes and relaxation that turns into realization and then to horror. This is a movie that honors the dead, and yet seeks to understand the Japanese as well and portray them realistically.  <br />The heroics on the ground in the face of daunting odds and total surprise are inspiring even in their futility. As is the end of the movie, which doesn't feel compelled (unlike in Pearl Harbor) to tell you what happened next. We know what happened next. The country was ripped from its complacency, and was changed forever. And mushroom clouds eventually came to Japan. There is a solemnity to the whole enterprise, an understanding of the tragedy that befell the Navy that day that will live in infamy. You cannot help but be swept away by it.
B000077VR3|5.0|This movie is incredible!  I watched it for the first time in a Fils Class and I practically hugged my professor for exposing me to this masterpiece!  If you own, or have a friend with a surround sound system, pop this in, crank up the volume and sing along if you can!  cuz it's a great movie and a wonderful time!
B00005PJ8O|5.0|'Patton' is more than a thrill ride, more than a spectacle, more than just your garden variety WWII epic. In addition to the virtuoso acting of George C. Scott -- which somehow never seems to fall into melodrama despite his bombast -- the film explores perhaps better than any other the attraction and the repulsion we feel towards the bloodthirsty glory hound warrior that Patton epitomized. At first blush, we see Patton before the flag in a powerful speech where he is larger than life -- an American counterpoint to Hitler and the awful pomp of the Nazis that seduced millions into evil. Patton surely has the capacity for evil -- note his preoccupation with Napoleon and his putting victory and glory over the blood of his men, and his absolute love of war and destruction. But throughout the film he inspires, cajoles and whips his men into an efficient fighting machine. We are both attracted by this and repelled at the same time. Patton becomes a valuable weapon, but must be muzzled at the end because he does not know how to stop and has no patience for civility. A man like Patton, if he had become president instead of Eisenhower, could have destroyed worlds if it meant his name writ large in the history books. And yet, men like Patton protected and served the country well, and indeed were essential to winning the war. <br /> <br />Like Churchill, Patton was cast off after the war. The people here and in Britain seemed to understand that a far different kind of leadership is needed in peacetime than in war. <br /> <br />*** <br /> <br />As for the movie, the war scenes themselves are merely scene-setters rather than scene-stealers the way it would be if it were done today. This isn't the Bridge on the River Kwai or Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. There are relatively few on-the-battlefield action scenes of consequence, and the soldiers themselves come off not as human beings so much as props for the generals, pieces on a chessboard. But that's all to the well and good. Patton didn't see his men as individuals so much as a means to an end. Because we don't get to know them too closely, it helps us understand, a bit, how Patton was able to spend their lives so easily as he focused on his goals of victory and glory.
B000060OFT|5.0|Stylish!  Great cinematography!  Whats not to love about this movie?????  I haven't seen a play of Romeo and Juliet but I have seen the old 70's version of this.  What a better update of this shakespearean sorrowful play!  I love this movie and I know every line in it!  Get this movie if you like old english and love romantic movies!  thumbs up for this movie!
B00004XONN|2.0|After one good and two great albums Radiohead wanted to explore new grounds, which is actually quite understandable. Unfortunately they failed to come up with something of any real interest or substance.<br /><br />There is not one real good song on this album. There are occasionally interesting sounds and passages, but most of it sounds like the soundeffects of a weird computer-game.<br /><br />For me this album was the ultimate disappointment of year 2000. Best track for me is \\"Optimistic\\".<br /><br />The second star is for the band's courage!
B00000JQFM|5.0|I grew up listening to Van Halen.  I always kidded that Barbara Streisand could have been singing lead, and I still would have dug them strictly for Eddie's guitar-playing.  I always thought he was the best, and I still think he is in the top 5 all time.  But I must pledge my allegiance to a new guitar hero.  Joe Satriani has the greatest guitar licks I have heard in a long time.  He has put together an outstanding body of work, and it all started with 'Surfing With The Alien'.  Even though 'Surfing' wasn't his first studio album, it is definitely the one that put him on the map.  The opening title track is fantastic, and I defy anyone to find a rock instrumental with more chops than 'Crushing Day'.  There are no songs to skip; everything is magnificent.  I dare say this is the perfect rock guitar album.  There is none better.
B00000294R|5.0|On this album Big L not only lays down rap lyrics but he builds a charachter on here and delivers a true work of art.  Lifestylez of da Poor and Dangerous presents Big L front and center dropping insane line after insane line.  Throughout this album , Big L builds a charachter that is crazy, criminally insane, foul tempered, clever, and insensitive to women.  This is the true genius of this album.. is the charachter development.. The off the wall lyrics he drops on most of the song are delievered with so much emotion (ie. the graveyard) that they force you to take notice of him an believe that he truthfully means what he's saying.  The beats are suited to fit where big l was taking it on this album , they arent platinum rap about the clubs type beats because the lyrics reflect  a grim , grimy state .. for the what they are ment to do they deliver well.  As far as the song writting goes, there are songs that range from talking about golddigging women to rapping about murdering priest and babies so the subject matter is overall broad.. though most of the songs are of a negative nature where big l raps about murder and rape.    Genius lyrics with creative charachter development lead to a true rap classic.. Big L drops lines on here at a level of cleverness that can only be matched by his follow up \\"the big picture\\". This album pushes freedom of speech further than any other rap album i've ever heard in my life.    I highly suggest this album to anyone that is a big rap fan.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|The movie starts out a bit slow ... but as it builds and builds it embraces the audience. It is truly a beautiful movie, probably one of Johnny Dep's best. The portrayal of Barrie's journey to develop Peter Pan makes for an interesting and thoroughly touching story, even if it does occasionally wander into melodrama. Fans of Kate Winslet will enjoy her wonderful performance as Carrie's muse and Hoffman's role, though small, is hilarious. The movie basically plays up on the relationship he develops with 4 boys who play sons of Kate Winslett. They become his inspiration for writing Peter Pan. Even having said that, it can't begin to discribe how moving and touching the entire movie plays out. Johnny Dep brings out the kid in all of us. The movie has the perfect balance of humor and sadness
B000022TSV|5.0|The VHS I have owned for years has given me great pleasure on each viewing.  However, the new DVD version is infinitely richer in both depth of color and sound.  I am certain I will enjoy it even more.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This was a very clear movie. A lot of information was gained from the communication between the characters, and it was easy to understand that they were chasing that ship because of the captain's sense of purpose and duty. It was full of incident, and every scene added to the movie's depth. It was interesting all the way, and there was plenty of excitement. In the end the captain was fooled by the enemy captain faking his identity, so it was decided to escort the French prize back to Valparaiso. There weren't any useless scenes to delete, and the ending was good. A very entertaining and instructive movie, and definitely worth watching, even if you're not a Russell Crowe fan.
0141439475|5.0|If you've only ever seen the Frankenstein movies, you will be shocked at the story in the actual book that started it all.  Rather than the cheesy, plodding monster that is out to destroy everyone, the actual Frankenstein is an intelligent creation of his creator, Victor Frankenstein (the monster himself actually has no name).  The monster yearns for acceptance and companionship, but when he is constantly turned away, scorned, and chased, he decides to destory everything his creator holds dear.  In this way, Frankenstein chases the monster to the ends of the earth (literally).  A gripping, touching (sometimes) and thrilling book so completely different from any of the movie versions that you won't understand how Hollywood got the cheesy plots from this book.  A true classic and along with Dracula, one of my all time favorite books (although this one is less a horror story and more a philosophical tale, hence the subtitle \\"The Modern Prometheus\\").  Essential reading.

0671027344|5.0|When I first opened The Perks of Being a Wallflower, the first thing that jumps out at you is the unique format.  The entire book is composed of letters the protagonist, Charlie, writes to an anonymous best friend.  By page 22 I was in love, not only with the book, but with the fictional character Charlie whose insight and brilliance exceeds many.  I found it very difficult to put this down and this truly is one of the only things that really makes sense to me.  I would recommend it as a must read to anyone of any age. Bravo.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|There are only three shows that I know where the act of conversation is elevated to the status of high art:  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, THE WEST WING (early seasons only), and THE GILMORE GIRLS.  Though these three shows may not have a great deal in common in other ways, all three revel in great talk.  Other shows have good talk, but these three have great, great talk.  Take just a sample, delivered at a machine gun pace:<br /><br />GRANDMA: You were on the phone.<br />GRANDPA: Long distance.<br />LORELAI: God?<br />GRANDPA: London.<br />LORELAI: God lives in London?<br />GRANDPA: My mother lives in London.<br />LORELAI: Your mother is God?<br />GRANDPA: Lorelai.<br />LORELAI: So, God IS a woman...<br />GRANDPA: Lorelai.<br />LORELAI: And a relative, that's so cool. I'm gonna totally ask for favors.<br /><br />Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, the self-proclaimed model for Lorelai Gilmore and the writer of an unreasonably large number of the brilliant screenplays, has an absolute genius for talk.  Few movies and no television series (apart from the above mentioned BUFFY and WEST WING-early-seasons-only) contain better talk.  I watch the episodes of this series with a persistent grin and an unceasing delight in the manner in which the show elevates mere talk to something greater than mere talk.  It is in many other ways a very good show, but what makes it exceptional is its gift for gab.<br /><br />But it takes more than a great script filled with great talk.  It takes actors who can pull it off.  But luckily, THE GILMORE GIRLS is filled with a bevy of competent actors who are completely capable of handling every nuance of the script.  All are at least solid, but in Lauren Graham the show has someone who is exceptional.  The show would be very good even with a lesser actress, but she is absolutely perfect as Lorelai Gilmore.<br /><br />There is never a point at which this show is ever less than completely entertaining, and it often puts me in mind of \\"A Prarie Home Companion,\\" with the way that you get to know each character in the town of Stars Hollow.  Although Lauren Graham dominates the show, the series in fact features an ensemble supporting cast, with each person bringing a perfect additional touch to the show.<br /><br />And for all literate folks the show is an especial delight.  How many shows routinely drop names like Stella (from STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE), Proust, Oscar Levant, Marlon Perkins (the Wild Kingdom guy), Tolstoy, John Muir, Thoreau, and so forth, as well as extended discussions of ennui.  And the musical references are consistently cool:  PJ Harvey, Belle and Sebastian, Nico, Blur, and a host of others.  I get all the references, but I think even if you don't it would be fun for once not to have a show whose scripts are directed at the lowest common denominator but no higher.<br /><br />I have to add that I love the interaction between Lorelai and Rory.  They have what is without question the finest onscreen relationship between parent and child on TV.  Oh, and I'd like to add that more than one person (well, two) has told me that Lorelai and Rory remind them of me and my daughter, so I like to keep that in mind when I watch the show.acter in the town of Stars Hollow.

0783240236|5.0|One of my favorites. The unsettling atmosphere in this film is created masterfully. There is a strangeness about the charactor of Melanie played by Tippi Hedron who never played a better role. She is pretty, alluring and by all outward appearances well adjusted. As well, her maladaption, insecurity and social ineptness lies beneath it all. She almost seems to be creating the bird problem herself,and this is the driving force of the film. The scene in the coffee shop is spectacular. Not only the strangers interacting but the culminating power of the birds. This movie stands alone, not even close to any other. For viewers of the sixties who saw this in theatres, it must have been terrifying. Considering the film technology of the era, their is little that is overtly fake looking. The effect that massive amounts of birds are attacking is genuinely projected. The lines in this movie are unique too, \\"Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the Earth\\", \\"I have never known birds of different species to flock together, why the simple concept is unimaginable...\\" \\"Its the end of the world\\". Watching the movie as it was intended to be seen(widescreen)on dvd is a treat. The picture is sharp and the sound is decent for its time. Cover your ears when Mitches' little girl screams, its pretty annoying. A curious and good movie.
B00097DX3U|3.0|I like this album.  The more I listen to it, the more it grows on me.  It's always interesting to see how guys who are in there late 30s/early 40s evolve musically.  They tend to write more mellow songs musically (recall \\"Californication\\" and \\"By the Way\\" by The Red Hot Chili Peppers).  It makes sense especially for this band because Cornell came from one of the most groundbreaking bands from the so-called \\"Grunge\\" scene with Soundgarden, which is a band I don't even consider Grunge, but a metal band, and in my opinion, the Black Sabbath of the late 80s/early 90s (the highest honor I can ever bestow upon any band!), and to me, Rage Against the Machine IS THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY ROCK BAND OF THE 90s.  Hands down!  They blew all their contemporaries away--Nirvana (boo!), Pearl Jam, etc. had nothing of RATM.<br /><br />That being said, although this is a good second offering from this band, it isn't a landmark album in anyway.  It's good, but not good enough for 5 stars.  I would give \\"Louder Than Love,\\" \\"Screaming Life/Fopp,\\" and \\"Ultramega OK\\" by Soundgarden 5 stars in a second.  I would also give the first RATM album and \\"The Battle for Los Angeles\\" 5 stars in a second as well.  Sheer musical brilliance can be heard on all of those albums--THE RIFFS, THE SOLOS, all LEGENDARY!  I think songwriting-wise, this album is lacking, and even riff-wise (sorry Mr. Morello).  Also, Tom's choices for effects on some of the melodies and solos are questionable.  There is one song on here where he uses the whammy pedal for the solo and it just really doesn't fit the song.  I would even go as far to say that the riffs from the first Audioslave album are much better and more consistent than the ones on this album (although the first album is much heavier).  Another minor criticism is that most of the songs start out mellow, and start to pick up and get heavy.  If a song is meant to be heavy, just start it out heavy for crying out loud!  These mellow beginnings just don't fit a lot of the songs, in my opinion.  As far as the solos go though, it is good to hear Tom shred it up like he did during the glory days of RATM.  It's refereshing to hear shredderific guitar solos from a guitar hero like Tom (one of my biggest influences on guitar and the very reason I use the whammy pedal in my effects rig!).  Keep guitar solos alive and well--enough of this minimalistic EMO/PSEUDO POP-PUNK CRAP!  I've heard enough rock guitar minimalism from current day rock bands to make me annoyed enough!  Thankfully though the guys from Audioslave don't agree with this ethic.t of the songs, in my opinion.

B00069YE0W|5.0|First of all, I would like to respond to the online reviewer Eironic--WTF?  \\"Frusciante's songwriting at best has only evolved marginally over the years since rejoining the Chili Peppers, and in someways, it's far less creative and inspired than what you can find on his first four solo albums\\"?  You must be joking bro.  Have you accomplished what Mr. Frusciante has musically?  Obviously not because I have never heard of you.  If Frusciante never put out any of these solo albums, nobody would be aware of the other side of John's musicianship--a strong singer-songwriter side.  Sure, his songs are short, but are no less poignant and relevant than any of his ground-breaking work with the Chili Peppers.  In fact, I think this album and \\"Shadows Collide with People\\" are as good as any Chili Peppers album.  For any neigh-sayers like Mr. Eironic who honestly don't believe that  Mr. Frusciante's songwriting hasn't evolved over the years, go back to your collection, from Mother's Milk to By the Way, then listen to Frusciante's solo albums.  If you can't hear a brilliant musical evolution you are clueless about music.  I really mean that, not to insult anybody, but to be frank and honest.  I have heard very few musicians in my 24 years that have evolved musically more than Mr. Frusciante.  In addition, I think Mr. Frusciante would feel very insulted by your statements Eironic--I'm insulted for crying out loud!  But I digress...<br /><br />Now, about this album.  Most of the songs are quite short, in fact the album as a whole isn't very long, but the songs are powerful, perhaps Frusciante's most deep and evocative lyrics ever, and acoustic music has never sound more powerful to me.  This album was recorded on an analog 8-track recorder from the 1970s.  Beautiful acoustic guitars with the occassional electric lead and/or other instrument--I believe I heard an accordian melody/solo on one of the songs.  The album also made me realize how amazing of a rhythm guitarist John is--many of the songs have unique rhythmic time signatures--time signatures that appear very difficult to play, but not for Mr. Frusciante, of course.  This album is a very close second favorite of mine, only to \\"Shadows Collide with People\\" of course which is a sonic masterpiece.  In any event, this another phenomenal album by Mr. Frusicante.  I never heard such brilliant acoustic minimalism since Pink Floyd.  'Nuff said.any of the songs have unique rhythmic time signatures--time signatures that appear very difficult to play, but not for Mr. Frusciante, of course.

B00005MAM2|5.0|This is one of the most perfect movies. I hate to call it anime because it does not play like a typical anime film. Katsuhiro Otomo has taken great strides to create characters that are not two dimensional. I enjoy this movie so much because of the relationship between Kaneda( the protagonist/alpha male) and Tetsuo ( Kaneda's weaker best friend). Basic storyline, Tetsuo is hurt while trying to prove himself to the gang. The government takes him and does experiments thus releasing his psychic powers. Between Tetsuo's new power, drugs and his own inferiority complex mayhem ensues. This eventually leads to a showdown with Kaneda. I love this movie!! I actually owned it on VHS in original Japanese and English dubb, BUT this Special Edition is much better. I love the extras that have been included and I especially love the new dubbing. It is a clearer translation than the orginal dubb. If you love anime or just sci fi movies this is a must have.
B000286RZM|4.0|As the title says, this is another good offering from Mr. Frusciante, but it isn't the modern art masterpiece that \\"Shadows Collide with People\\" is, and rightfully so, that album cannot and will not ever be duplicated.  It is a great album, nonetheless.  I love the song \\"The Mirror\\" in particular.  Another great song that reflects some very deep emotions and experiences from Mr. Frusciante.  And his rhythm guitar work is very expressive, intricate and overall outstanding.  The one thing about this album and every other album he has put out is that reflects that this guy has staying/outlasting power--he has consistently put out great albums for almost 15 years now, is a musician's musician in every sense of the world, a musical genius, a constant force of creativity, and a man that has cast a huge shadow on rock and popular music.  He is somebody who will outlast all of his contemporaries and will always make relevant and beautiful music.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|I don't regret taking the time to watch Firefly, but I certainly don't feel like it warrants raving about. For starters the premise of prostitution being a highly regarded profession for which classy schools exist is such a ridiculously juvenile attempt at being confrontational. This show is more interesting than standard sci-fi fare (Star Trek, Stargate, Babylon 5), but that isn't saying much. It's not as good as Sliders, the plots aren't as well written, and the way they explore a new planet in each episode is a very similar premise. I would go as far as to call it shamelessly derivitive. Nathan Fillion was convincing as reluctantly responsible leader Malcolm, and River's psychological instability was interesting. The rest of the characters were predicable and one-dimensional. The show is worth watching, just not worth getting excited about.  <br />
0553210246|4.0|This book has everything fans of the 19th century novel, such as myself, love-melodrama, romance, secrets, plot twists, mistaken identities, rising fortunes, and, of course, a tragic ending.  I can't give much away because the novel rests on a series of shocking revelations-each more shocking than the last!<br /><br /> However, since the book begins with the most startling event of all, and since it is given away on the back of the book, and happens at the very beginning, I will only deal with that event, which is what drew me to the book in the first place.  This will set the stage and make you want to read the book as much as I did when my friend told me about it!<br /><br />The main character is a certain Henchard who SELLS HIS WIFE AND INFANT DAUGHTER. That's right, he sells them!  To a sailor!  Granted, he is drunk.  It's an intriguing study of alcoholism, although some men wouldn't have to be one to want to sell their wives for some beer if they could get away with it.  Henchard's wife is understandably furious, and leaves with the sailor.  After this, Henchard vows to never again drink-although the introduction to my edition suggests that he remains a \\"dry drunk\\".  I don't exactly know what that that entails, but the introduction assured me that it was one of the first books on alcoholism which is important enough.<br /><br />Henchard then redeems himself and in Jean Valjean fashion would like to both atone for, and hide, his shameful past.  He tries to find his wife and daughter, and that's where all the fascinating plot twists come in.  It's very well-written and kept my attention throughout.  I have also read \\"Tess\\" by Hardy and I like his writing style.  I cannot say that his works moved me in any profound way as other literature has, but I'm not sure why that's important.  There's a lot of humor and farce in this book which is first-rate, and I just enjoyed his protagonist-it's not easy to create one so believable and yet so interesting at the same time.<br /><br />Yes, there's a lot of melodrama, but who is to say that an individual like Henchard, with his addictions and his furious personality, wouldn't realistically live a melodramatic life?  I'm sure all those who panned this book may have known someone who found a way to surround themselves with drama even in this day and age.  All the book's drama is caused by Henchard and his mercurial personality-if at any time he'd played things differently he could have had a better life.  But no, he had to be a lunatic.e time.   <br /> <br />Yes, there's a lot of melodrama, but who is to say that an individual like Henchard, with his addictions and his furious personality, wouldn't realistically live a melodramatic life?

B0002DB50E|5.0|David Cronenberg was far ahead of his time when he wrote and directed this horrifically organic baroque video-punk epic.     James Wood's portrayal of a sleazy Cable TV-con-man-- lost in his own venal dementia of sex and violence, is legendary. A lot has been said and written about \\"Videodrome's\\" influence on modern horror cyber-cinema...Trust me-- it's earned.  Criterion continues to deliver the ultimate package of movies that matter.
0375713751|5.0|This book is very funny.  Much more than that, it's poignant and true to a fault.  Those that think this book is a blow to feminism either live in an alternate reality or haven't faced the issue of being a working mother yet.  This book IS reality.  It may be an exaggerated version, which, of course, is for comic relief, but it is SO true. I think it should be mandatory reading for anyone that's thinking of becoming, or that ever has contact with, a working mother. Contrary to some of the other opinions posted, I don't think the message of this book is that women can't do both: the message is that in doing both we need to give up on some of the ideals and expectations that we were raised with.  I'm doing both and I wouldn't have it any other way, but I'm not going to pretend that it's easy, nor will I pretend that being a working mother is the same as being a working father.  I will be handing out many copies of this book as gifts.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Arnold is amazing.  So is Lou. <br />Lou has big arms.  They both lift a lot. <br />I like when Arnold says: \\"Make a line..\\" <br /> <br />This may be the most deliberate movie ever. <br /> <br />Everyone should buy it and watch it.  Then they should lift a lot of weight. Da.
B0006L16N8|4.0|One of the things that gives songwriters staying power is the gift for a great melody.  Coldplay demonstrates this talent thoroughly on X&Y, showing that their previous efforts were not a fluke.  They have real talent.  The songs are catchy, with melodies that are innovative but very musical.  Chris Martin's lyrics are heartfelt and seem drawn from real-life experience, touching on real emotional issues.  \\"Fix You,\\" for example, deals with trying to help someone else through a difficult experience.   <br /> <br />I have continued to listen to \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" regularly since it came out.  X&Y has the same persistent appeal.  I'm glad I bought it, and I don't buy many new albums these days.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Encore has been showing Christine a lot lately and I've had a chance to see if for the first time in close to 20 years.  I think it's safe to say that Christine is one of the best adaptions of a Stephen King story.  Arnie (Keith Gordon) is a high school nerd, picked on by bullies as well as his domineering mother.  Arnie even has white tape holding his coke-bottled eyeglass frames together.  One day Arnie and his best fried, Jock Dennis (John Stockwell) visit a junkyard where they find an old, junky 1958 Plymouth fury.  Arnie has to have the car and buys it from the old junk dealer played by Roberts blossom who you may recall as the old man who lived next door to Macauley Caulkin in \\"Home Alone\\".<br /><br />Arnie's parents are NOT happy he bought the car and forbid them to keep the car at the house so he takes it to a do-it-yourself garage run by the great character actor Robert Prosky.  As Arnie begins to restore the car something begins to happen to him.  He begins to gain confidence.  He no longer allows his parents to bully him, he no longer wears his glasses and he's gone after the hot girl in school Leigh played by Alexandra Paul.  As his obsession with his car grows, Arnie begins pushing his girl and only friend away as his own sanity begins to teeter.  When the bullies break into the garage and vandalize the car...look out!  This car wants revenge and intends to get it wheter Arnie is along for the ride or not.  It all leads to a climatic showdown as Christine will not allow anyone to come between Arnie and herself.<br /><br />is the car haunted?  Demon posessed?  Who knows.  But it is a wonderful psychological horror as we see Arnie transform from mild-mannered geek to the obsessed murderer.  For a change we had young people in a horror film who acted intelligently and how most kids would react.  Gordon does a great job in the role and its a shame he didn't get many acting shots after this film.  The special edition is very welcome to fans of this 80's film.film.
0767817478|3.0|I know this is a bad film in comparison to similar films like Jurassic Park, but for some reason I still find myself watching it over and over. I guess this film is one of those \\"so-bad-it's-good\\" niche films. And let's face it, that's what the Japanese Godzilla films were - cheesy niche films with shoestring budgets. Come on, they were movies with guys in rubber monster costumes stomping through a cardboard miniature of downtown Tokyo! So what were you expecting going into this film?  <br /> <br />Yes, Godzilla looks like a giant iguana in this film, but would you have really taken the old \\"guy in a big rubber suit\\" Gozilla seriously as he rampages through real-life Manhattan? Maybe if they had replaced real-life Manhattan with a Manhattan made from cardboard, Godzilla fans would have been creaming their shorts.   <br /> <br />Yes, the \\"real\\" Godzilla can't lay eggs, but the Madison Square Garden portion of the film is one of the more exciting parts of the film, although a clear rip-off of the raptors in Jurassic Park.  <br /> <br />The CG is good in some scenes, visible cruddy in others. There's a close up toward the end of the film when a CG Godzilla nudges one of his dead babies with his totally fake-looking nose. Big G's nose is colored a bright green, yet the dead baby G's body is a dark green. So fake. And the quick shot of the human characters in the same frame as the gigantic lizard are tell-tale bluescreen shots. And sure, it rains in the real world, but did this film really need so so so MUCH rain? It got distracting. All the rain makes it so obvious that they were trying to cover up the so-so CG effects, and it doesn't work. Ugh...  <br /> <br />And yes, this film is full of cliched characters. There's the nerdy scientist no one listens to but who is always right in Matthew Broderick. (Who, by the way, runs like a girl when the Godzillas are chasing him. I know the Army boots were part of his disguise, but you could have had him bring a pair of Conversesneakers with him so he can run like he did as Ferris Bueller again, damn it.) I don't know if they tried to get Jeff Goldblum to play Broderick's character, since he's played this very same damn character so many times before (The Fly, the aforementioned Jurassic Park, and the previous Rolland Emmerich/Dean Devlin creation Independence Day). Maybe Goldblum was getting tired of being typecasted. Then there's the dim blond in the cute Maria Pitillo. There's the \\"goomba\\" Italian couple with the thick New York accents, the guy of the couple played by Hank Azaria. There's the French guys, led by Jean Reno, who all seem to have names starting with \\"Jean\\" (\\"Where is Jean-Luc? Where is Jean-Pierre?\\")There's the clueless politicians who are more worried about their approval ratings, upcoming elections, and budgets rather than the safety and welfare of the citizens they're supposed to be serving. There's the army, who's solution to everything is \\"shoot everything we have at Godzilla, even though he doesn't seem to be getting hurt at all.\\" Yes, these are all cliched, by-the-book (and borderline offensive) characters, just revel in the cliches and wait for Godzilla to show up again to crush things. <br /> <br />The dialogue is so-so, with some laughable lines like \\"How do you lose something so big?\\" (referring to Godzilla's disappearance 5 minutes after showing in Manhattan), \\"That's a lot of fish,\\" and the Jaws rip-off line \\"We need bigger guns.\\" And it's still puzzling to me how people can cheer and pat each other on the backs for \\"a job well done\\" after killing a giant lizard who really meant no harm toward humanity and was just following its instincts. How selfish humanity is to cheer and applaud at the destruction of a species just to get our city back...  <br /> <br />That's a real problem with the film - you never fully hate Godzilla for what he's doing, and you kinda sympathize for him, but not much. It's like they couldn't decide whether Godzilla should be a threat tohumanity or a creature humanity should feel sorry for and in awe of. The film tries to find the middle ground between fear and awe Jurassic Park achieved, but fails.  <br /> <br />Like I said, I still enjoy this movie for what it is. Maybe I just like watching New York City getting trashed since I live roughly 20 miles away. And the duo of Emmerich and Devlin seem to love destroying The Big Apple. In Independence Day, Godzilla, and The Day After Tomorrow, New Yory City eats it each time.  <br /> <br />In this film, Godzilla rampages through the Fulton FIsh Market, Madison Square Garden is blown up real good, the Brooklyn Bridge is annihilated, The Chrystler Building gets destroyed AGAIN (this seems to be a running gag in Hollywood films in 1998, since both Deep Impact and Armageddon BOTH laid waste to the Chrystler Building just months before this film's release. And of course, there's the baby Godzilla teaser that the end of the film, setting up the sequel that will clearly never happen.  <br /> <br />SO if you can get over the cheesiness and flaws and just drink it in as some fun mayhem and destruction, you'll have fun.
B0007P0LPC|5.0|Back in the 60's, the balletic duo that were Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn were all the rage in the ballet business. They danced with passionate chemistry and artistic integrity, committing themselves to their performance so harmoniously that they seemed to exist only within the time/setting of the ballet's fantasy world itself. Swan Lake, Tchaikovsky's first ballet, was initally a dismal failure in St. Petersburg. But he cleaned it up, revised the score and continued to stage it and it became a much loved ballet. For a prima ballerina like Margot Fonteyn, the dual role of Odette/Odile is a star vehicle and dancer's ticket to fame. She becomes the character. Her dancing is virtuosic, and yes, as one critic pointed out, her body type is apparently a bit bigger than the very frail, bony ballerinas of today - Allesandra Ferri is sickly thin sometimes. Fonteyn is still talked about as a major star and all ballet connoisseurs an fans revere here work. Likewise, Nureyev was a great figure in the ballet world, a man who would influence the later star Mikhail Borishnnokoff. Nureyeve got into his characters with dramatic flair and dancing bravura. As Prince Siegfried, he is totally convincing. Fonteyn and Nureyev'spas de deuxs are miraculous to watch. The look of the film is dated and grainy but that's due to its age- this is a 60's performance. But it still looks good and the sets and costumes are gorgeous and just what I imagine when I dream of Swan Lake.
B000002UWW|5.0|The title sums this CD up personally.  It's prefectly sarcastic.  This is one great CD.  I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  There is not a song on here or any RHCP CD that I wouldn't listen to.  This has a lot of my favorites.  I like these even more so than some of their later work.  My favorites are: Behind The Sun, me & My Friends, Backwods, Knock Me Down, Under The Bridge, Taste The Pain, Catholic School Girls Rule, and Johnny, Kick A Hole In The Sky.  This CD has no bad songs.  There's a lot of people who don't like the Warner Bros. Greatest Hits because they left off some classics (Knock Me Down, Around The World) but a real fan will love this CD as well as the 2003 Greatest Hits as a good listen, and have all the studio albums anyway.  It's a great way to hear so many good songs without switching CD's.
0385338686|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella's books- they're enjoyable, romantic, and funny. I expected the same from \\"Undomestic Goddess,\\" and I got what I was looking for.  <br /> <br />In the beginning, reading about a lawyer who's on the verge of having panic attacks almost gave me one. Kinsella can really make you feel what the character is feeling (and thats not the only time). The plot itself is rather unbelievable, but who cares? To me, that made the book even better.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for a great fun read, or if you need some new chick lit to read, pick up this book (or any of them, really). Although if you're stressed out about work, you might just want to wait til you cool off.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This CD is a must own for all Buffy Fans.  The soundtrack to one of the coolest episodes from The Buffy series is an absolute joy to listen to.  Amazon lists The \\"Main Title\\" track as track #1 on the CD which is where it should be as that's where it appears in the episode, but that track is actually #19 on the CD, which I thought was odd.  If you import the album into iTunes, you can reassign the track numbers and put \\"The Main Title\\" in its correct place as track #1.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|The premise of this film sounded a little bizarre when I heard of it -- a WWI flying ace who's been turned into a pig?  I was skeptical when I bought it, but I am a huge Miyazaki fan, so I thought I'd give it a chance.  Turns out, it's every bit as fabulous and off-beat as his other films -- some really great animation sequences, and some truly funny lines.  The ending (in my humble opinion) was a bit of a dud (a long narrative segment that leaves the fate of the hero ambiguous), so it's definitely not my favorite (compared to films like Mononoke and Spirited Away), but it's worth watching and owning.
B000002NJM|5.0|Seeing \\"Pulp Fiction\\" was quite a revelation. I thought,\\"This is the kind of movie I've waited for my whole life.\\" Although I was only 16 when I saw it at the movies. So I couldn't wait for the follow-up to Pulp. And I waited, and waited, and waited seemingly forever for Quentin Tarantino's next movie. Finally in December of 1997 came \\"Jackie Brown\\". I didn't see the movie when it came out but I'd always look at the soundtrack in the music stores wondering if I should buy it. After all, the soundtrack to Pulp was as incredible as the movie. Really, the music is intregal to the movie, you can't separate the two. So I never bought the soundtrack to Jackie because I hadn't watched the movie. Then last summer I finally watched the movie on T.V. I quickly realized that it was quite a good movie and had some really cool music as well. Now I'm ashamed to say that I waited so long to watch the movie and thus buy the soundtrack, and the movie on DVD. There are great hits here such as \\"Midnight Confession\\", \\"Strawberry Letter #23\\", and \\"Didn't I Blow Your Mind This Time\\" which is essentially the movies theme. But there are wonderful lost classics such as \\"Street Life\\", Minnie Ripperton's \\"Inside My Love\\", Johnny Cash's \\"Tennessee Stud\\", Bobby Womack singing \\"Across 110th St\\", and of course Pam Grier herself singing \\"Long Time Woman\\". If you haven't seen the movie I recommend you do. It's excellent. You should probably wait to buy the soundtrack until after you've seen the movie too, otherwise the songs won't have the same impact. Either way though it's another in the long line of quirky, funky, and phenomenal Tarantino sountracks.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausicaa is definitely one of Miyazaki's best!  Similar in theme to Princess Mononoke (the tendency of humanity to be self-destructive in regards to the environment), it's slightly less violent and graphic, but still full of great action sequences.  The actors who provided the voices for the dub-over were well chosen -- Patrick Stewart, Uma Thurman, Chris Sarandon were all perfect.  Alison Lohman (whom I've only seen in Big Fish) was great as the voice of Nausicaa.  Loved the visual, loved the music, loved it!  (One word of caution: the tune sung by the little kid voice during the \\"flashback\\" moments will become inextricably lodged in your brain for several weeks after watching the film.  Beware.)
B00005JNSK|5.0|In this remake, and I use this word loosely, of Willy Wonka and the Charlie Factory, Tim Burton adapts an completely different view of the beloved children's novel.  He adds a very interesting back-story which explains alot about the Willy Wonka of today.  The years of musicals are left behind, and Tim Burton adds many new graphics, which only enhance the movie, not deter acting, as technology seems to be doing to the stories.    Johnny Depp once again does not let down audiences.  He acts in a completely zany way different then any other his roles.  In his character, he appears to not only dislike children but parents as well.  His facial experiences as well as voices make this movie a laugh a minute.      Tim Burton adds his characteristic different style to this movie.  This remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory gives children a good movie to see.  Recommended for children of all ages.  Great family movie.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This album is a little more upbeat than her debut album. Some songs can get old, and the lyrics aren't as good as her 1st album in some ways. But it's Fiona Apple, and she makes great music. Most songs are good on this album except mistake, I don't know why I don't like it. Sometimes I can like her song one day, and be annoyed with it the next. If you liked her first album, this one won't be as good in your mind (but you'll still love it!). If you didn't like Tidal you'll probably like this one better. I recommend this highly. <br /> <br />PS: Get her 3rd album if Sony ever releases it. I downloaded it, 3rd is a charm!
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple is a talented musician and song writer. Her music is soothing, and her lyrics will leave you shocked. Her musical talent is unbelievable at only 19. Pale September is a soothing song, and she sounds like an angel. That is probably my favorite song. This CD is for slower piano music, so if you like har rock or fast tunes get something else. But I highly recommend this! I bought this CD and it had to grow on me, so listen to it a couple times, then you won't be able to stop listening to it.
B000003S0P|5.0|For years King Crimson have supplied us with great progressive rock music. Fripp and company always strive to improve and push the limits of creativity.        The title track, a heavy, angry, dissonant instrumental instantly grabs your attention. \\"Fallen Angel\\" starts out calm but soon transforms into a rocking tune. \\"One More Red Nightmare\\", another heavy tune, showcases excellent drumming from Bruford and great saxophone work. \\"Providence\\", a jam-based instrumental, has some moments... but for me it's the weakest song on the disc. Mostly, \\"Starless\\" is a very dark and ominous slow-tempo song. Fripp's tasty guitar work builds up quite a bit of tension until the climax... where for a few minutes the tune smokes.       \\"Red\\" is a brooding album and may not be the best starting point for those new to KC. Maybe \\"Starless and Bible Black\\", \\"Discipline\\" or \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" would be a better introduction? Listen to the samples, read the reviews... some are really well written (mine excluded), and enjoy this amazing band.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I purchased this CD to listen before going to the play next month.  I love the performances and the music. I hope that the performance that I see lives up to this album. <br /> <br />The music and lyrics are particularly clever. I liked Popular and Defying Gravity, but I also loved For Good and the love song. I put this album on a par with Rent.

B0009MDPYM|3.0|it seems that Reeves is in denial about the end of the Matrix franchise.  <br /> <br />Here Reeves plays an unfortunate exorcist wandering the streets of New York banishing misbehaving half breed demons back to hell. Constantine is yet another movie derived from a comic book series I haven't read, but frankly, I don't get the feeling I missed that much. <br /> <br />The writer and director have managed to almost completely recreates the Matrix plot in this new context (substitue demons for Rogue programmes and the real world / hell divide for the real world / matrix divide), which you might have thought would make it an easier adjustment for Reeves but he still fails to act, turning in yet another stirling performance as himself, which worked sort of OK-ish in the Matrix, but by now has become a little tired. <br /> <br />Rachel Weisz plays Keanu's love interest, who is roped into Reeves' anti-demon war when her twin sister (who has been committed to a mental institution because she sees demons) kills herself and (as a good catholic) is cast into hell. <br /> <br />Whilst some have raved about Rachel Weisz's performance here I can't help feeling its more because she's gorgeous than as a result of her acting talent. Even if her acting was of oscar winning quality, there's not much she can do about the script (her character's actions are utterly unbelieveable even within the scope of the ridiculous plot). <br /> <br />Having said all that, I was entertained (and there are some good bits at the end where Satan appears as a snorting man in a white suit). <br /> <br />
0679882820|5.0|My son (18 months) loves this book.  We read it many times and he is still thrilled with it.  He likes when I make him bounce with the boom boom boom Mr. Brown makes thunder.  Sometimes we will be out and we will hear a noise and wonder if Mr. Brown could make it!
0783117523|3.0|Tempting though it is to pretend otherwise (although to be honest I had never previously heard of Gia), the real reason I bought this DVD was to see more of Angelina Jolie after watching several of her action movies (Mr and Mrs Smith, Tomb Raider I and II, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow...). In the literal sense I was not dissapointed since Ms Jolie spends half the movie with no clothes on. But her performance is captivating for other (perhaps more worthy) reasons... <br /> <br />On the downside the movie is rather depressing (but then that's no surprise given Jolie plays a frenetic superstar model who becomes a junky and dies of aids). Very few holes are barred (as well as the gratuitous nudity the movie also includes reasonably explicit lesbian love scenes, intravenous drug use, and so forth) so probably not one for the kids. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the film for me is Gia's dysfunctional relationship with her mother (the movie hints that this was the driving force behind her self destructive behaviour). <br /> <br />On the upside the characters are well drawn, particularly Jolie, her mother (who to the end remains in denial about her level of responsibility for her daughter's behaviour), and her confused girlfriend. The plot is well constructed and the scenes beautifully shot.
B000002KDG|5.0|First of all this album absolutely changed my life.  The album contains both sides of Shakey: his acoustic and then the filthy grunge with the horse.  On another note, each song is profound and just stellar.    For those who bash an album for one song (Da peace dogg).  Your review is full of lies.  Def leppard ripped that line of neil.  THeir debut album was in 1980, this concert(rust never sleeps) and album were both in '79.  Interesting how you can even tolerate listening to  that garbage let alone accuse on of the greatest artists of all time to being a copy cat.  Secondly the song my, my hey, hey was dedicated to johnny rotten yes, but he was not a bloody ramone, he was a sex pistol.  Please check your facts before you accuse and bash classic albums and artists of stealing.  I must be the idiot here though after reading through all of da peace doggs reviews he or she must be joking and playing a little trick on all of us.  if not please stop.    back to the actual album, this may have been one of the best albums and concerts of all time I highly reccomend you purchase this album and if you decide you like don't think twice about buying the concert dvd.
0440236738|2.0|I've read other novels by Harlan Coben.  The only reason I gave this one two stars was because I did, in fact, finish it, but barely.  Lord,  he does go on.  And hasn't any writing professor at Amherst ever mentioned to him that a cliff-hanger a second is a second too many?  Frankly, I didn't give a rat's a--s about Sheila. Coben's female characters are fairly dull and one-dimensional compared to the men.  That's typical of male writers.  The only really good female character in the book COULD have been Will's mother, but she died, unfortunately, and all we have are a few piquant memories.  Anyway, the book was far too long for no reason. And the Ghost (so relentlessly, tediously grotesque you want  to say 'Oh, come off it!) , the airy-fairy lost brother - the FBI goons - it's all just one humongous, totally improbable stretch.  I finished it cause  I needed something to read while the library was closed, and I'm actually embarrassed to admit I didn't just put the darned thing down and go to a movie.
020161622X|5.0|I got this book many years ago and read it cover to cover; a rare thing for me to do with a technical book. Recently I pulled it off the bookshelf and put it on my nightstand, and I am enjoying it all over again. I have a Master's degree in CS and have been coding for over 25 years. From my own experience I can promise you that the information and advice in this book goes to the very heart of the art, science, and practice of computer programming -- in any language, in any environment. Even for an old coder, such as myself, it can serve as an inspiration to return to many of the best practices you already knew, but have unintentionally drifted away from over time. This valuable resource deserves a place on every coder's bookshelf.
B00000IAU3|4.0|A great CD.  Dido has a lovely voice and I am satisfyied with my purchase.
B000683VI4|4.0|My title says it all. The Notebook is not the greatest movie I have ever seen (as most women I know would claim), but it's worth your time if your girl wants to watch a sweet romance that won't put you to sleep. The beauty of Rachel McAdams held my attention throughout as did the well told story.
B00008NRI8|4.0|Hugh Grants quick wit makes this movie.  It is very predictable in the end, but what romance movie isn't.  Hugh Grant brings his British Humor over to our home of New York City.  In this movie he portrays a womanizer (not so far from the truth) but eventually falls for the unexpected.  Sandra Bullock shows once again why she is prefect for these movies.  She has definitely graduated from the times of Speed and has chosen a great role.  Classic lines are present in the film, which will have you recalling them laughing hours after the film is over.  Great date movie.
B00003CXAT|3.0|Steven Spielberg has directed some of the biggest and best movies ever made: JAWS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, SCHINDLER'S LIST, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.<br /><br />But, when kids are involved in his movies, he indulges them and spoils them--and the movies are ruined by a deadly amount of The Cutes.<br /><br />Those first truly great movies I've mentioned all have one thing in common: no cute, adorable kids as main characters.<br /><br />Watch INDIANA JONES & THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, and compare it to RAIDERS and you'll see what I mean.  It's like Mr. Spielberg loses his genius-like ability to craft a film when cute kids show up on the set.  Still don't believe me?  One word: HOOK.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's my major problem with JURASSIC PARK.<br /><br />Michael Crichton's original novel is a brilliant, well-oiled machine of a story.  Read it.  But although some of Crichton's excellent ethical arguments make it into the film, the menace and suspense of the original storyline are lost because Sam Neill's character has to warm up to the idea of having some cute, adorable kids himself.<br /><br />The priority of the novel was: Not To Get Eaten.<br /><br />The priority, at times, of the film appeared to be: Kids Are Just Too Darn Cute For Anyone to Resist Them.<br /><br />The best scene in the movie was also the most exciting chapter in the book: the first time we see the T-Rex tearing its way out of its pen and rampaging against the guests.<br /><br />The special effects were the real stars of this movie.  I wish they would've had more screen time.
B00005JMAH|4.0|In the third installment of the Harry Potter movies, the new director Alfonso Curan moves the movies into suspense and darkness.  In Azkaban, Curan takes away the sugar coating and pushing limit on its PG rating.  The actors themselves have grown not only physically but also emotionally since the first movie.  Special effects were great except of course for the werewolf.  You would think that with such great resources to make the dementors they would be able to make a much more realistic werewolf. <br /> <br />Some things did disappoint causing me only to give four stars.  For the avid Harry Potter reader, some essential subplots were completely removed from the movie.  Also the story was moved around.  Some disappointing acting scenes were Daniel Radcliff's emotional moments.  Hopefully he improves before the emotional Goblet of Fire <br /> <br />Still a good movie, recommend for people of all ages.  However parents I would suggest caution when viewing to small children, some scenes are a bit intense. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was an early convert to Firefly. Even though its' network broadcast was missing the pilot episode until the end of its' run I absolutely loved the show. And when it came out on DVD I purchased it right away. With three unaired episodes and the shows in the correct order it made me fall in love all over again. What some shows take years to do this little show did in thirteen episodes.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|\\"Gilmore Girls\\" is pure fun - the wittiest dialogue, the best written comic situations, acted by stellar turns from Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, Scott Patterson and the ensemble cast. Although it is labelled \\"family entertainment\\" it is far from being bland or boring but instead offers an insightful look at family dynamics and does so in a most entertaining way. Season Three develops the characters even more and puts them in new circumstances and forces them to make decisions that will change their lives forever. Can't wait for Season Four!
B000003TAW|5.0|I wrote a review before, a long time ago, about this CD and I gave it 4 stars, never truly thinking that much about it. I was wrong. This isn't a four star album, its 5 star. Here's why...<br /><br />Weezer is the epitome of feel good rock. They don't sing too heavily on drugs, and they are pretty clean when it comes to the purpose of their music. Its just to have fun. Songs like \\"Say It Ain't So\\" and \\"My Name is Jonas' have become anthems for my college years. I became a fan much later then some, and I must say that I was missing out. \\"Buddy Holly\\" though not my favorite track, launched these guys into the main stream. If you want Weezer, this is where to start. Get the Blue Album, then get Pinkerton.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these guys. \\"Undone\\" and \\"Holiday\\" are two more awesome tracks and \\"Only In Dreams\\" is one of the best closers to an album ever.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0895260131|5.0|I often find it to be very interesting and amazing that people, especially liberal's have this incredible and tremendous capability to write there thoughts in a cohessive and understandable manner, all the while actually lacking the ability to read history.  This book just regurgitates in a very digestible way what historical \\"PRIMARY SOURCE\\" documentation verifies.  Please if you write a review number one know your history and two please, please actually read the book.
B000065PUE|5.0|Doolittle is such an excellent album. The Pixies are just good,period. They are one of the few bands that I actually stay really excited about. They have been such a huge indie rock influence for the past 20 years or so. They have influenced so many talented bands from Nirvana to Radiohead.<br /><br />Doolittle is a really great album. I think I like it better than Surfer Rosa, which is also an excellent album. This album features excellent tracks such as \\"Monkey Gone to Heaven,\\" \\"Here comes your Man\\", \\"Gouge Away\\", \\"LaLa Love You\\", \\"Debaser\\", and \\"Crackity Jones.\\" This album is just eclectic, fun and different. It is still classic Pixies, which makes it better. It is worth the money and you can pick up most Pixies albums relatively cheap. The Pixies are definitely one of those bands you are glad are not so mainstream because its like holding a little secret of splendor.
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo is very much a classic of animated movies which brings family together in a heartwarming movie great for all ages and a gem to keep
0345360338|4.0|This book continues the high standards set by Ms. Pennmen for historical novels.  Fiction is woven with historical facts so expertly that the characters and their conflicts truly come alive.  The only suggestion I would make is that Ms. Pennmen include a more detailed genealogy of the characters, possibly including more generations before and after the main characters.  This would add another dimension for those readers who enjoy this type of detail.  Otherwise, a most enjoyable book.  I am just starting to read the final book of this trilogy, The Reckoning, and I expect to enjoy it just as much as Falls the Shadow.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I love it!  She's amazing.  You'd never guess that she is only 15 years old.
0783240287|5.0|This was better than the stage play. The special effects added a lot to the performance.
B00080ZG10|4.0|If you follow aviation and are interested in the history this is the show for you. Hughes was a genius who received less than his due for the advancements he inspired. Requires close attention, you're gonna have to pause this one for every bathroom break. Some foreshadowing of his eventual lunacy but the film does not dwell on it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|When I first heard this cd, I immediately knew it was a keeper. Right away I fell in love with \\"American Idiot\\" (song) and \\"Holiday\\" scrapped its way up to #2 on my all-time favorites list. But that isn't nearly everything this cd has to offer. <br /> <br />The two most notable tracks are \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" due to their length. The revival of rock opera tracks is a brilliant addition to Green Day's arsenol. <br /> <br />In fact, the entire cd plays as a rock opera. The themes, lyrics, and moods are reoccur throughout the cd. The story is one of the political and social confusion of modern America, and it is brilliantly told. <br /> <br />The guitars and drums throughout the album flow perfectly. The lyrics recognize the \\"line\\" and intentionally stretch it as far as possible without going over the top. Overall, the songs as individuals and combined into the full \\"story\\" manage to create one hell of a cd. <br /> <br />I am not sure that Green Day can top this cd next time, but I will anxiously await them. Green Day has returned and this cd manages to pump loads of emotion into a fan base that was withering.
1586210912|4.0|This is a very well-written book.  Anyone should be able to easily get through this book, and learn a great deal about personal management.
B0007XT87G|4.0|I can't say much more than what people have already said.  The first half of the album takes a lot of getting used to if you like traditional rock songs. But it twists into your psyche if you let it.  The angular verse melody of the title track is so atypical of anything being done, and yet it has a powerful hook of its own.  \\"Lazarus\\" is gorgeous and unforgettable. \\"Halo\\" is catchy; even the distorted spoken part is a hook of its own!  \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" is a brilliant epic, with somber lyrics, intense, gripping chord changes, and a head-melting rock section that will pulverize every bit of your soul.  It does peter out around \\"Open Car,\\" and I'm not fond of \\"Start of Something Beatiful\\" but \\"Glass Arm Shattered\\" does end the album nicely in a sort of faux-Beck way.   <br /> <br />I recommend it to anyone starting with PT.  It's the Radiofloyd sound with heavy rock infused.  And let it sink.  That's the way it works best.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's second film revolves around 4 people that have a great life and are happy, but a series of choices and mistakes causes that feeling of happiness to go away. But, no matter what, they still maintain that happiness because they have nothing else to hold onto. They all still cling onto it even though their lives are thrown into a fiery downfall.<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky has made one of the best films of the 90's. He hits you hard with his sensory-based direction. He makes you react to what is being shown on the screen with a gut thudding motion that would make the strongest man cry. He has mastered the art of showing people that are all good then sends their lives into a tumbling downfall. His direction is wild and all over the place, and he does the direction with such an artistry that you can't help but merzmerized by what is going on the screen.<br /><br />Delusions of Grandour come to mind when we look at these characters. We feel some sort of pain when we watch these characters go ahead and form a niche in making their life worse until the point where they cannot turn back and realize all of the mistakes that they are making. It self induces pity from us towards the characters. We feel things when we watch the film.<br /><br />We don't even realize what we are watching till the end when we tell ourselves how we like this film.<br /><br />In my personal opinon, I was watching a mastery of filmaking. I formed that we all have our own dreams and reality that we hold onto no matter how much pain, torment, trouble or feeling that we have towards our life, we hold onto the dream no matter what. Dreams can be ruined by what we do and the mistakes that we make.<br /><br />I enjoyed this wonderful piece of film making, because it shows us a harsh and brutal reality.
0679720200|5.0|All in all, the best book I have ever read! This novel packs one hell of a punch. Read it twice before you judge it! But read it anyways.
0399236058|4.0|I like this book and my son loves it. It's a little hard to read (makes you out of breath), but we always sing it when we read it. This would make a great addition to any toddler's collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never watched this program before and am amazed how I could have overlooked this awesome show.  The characters really clicked together. The story lines, the dialogue of the characters, the action, the entire series is excellent.  It ranks right up there with Stargate SG-1. A truly well written and filmed program.  I only wish there were more seasons. It ended far too soon. I can hardly wait for the movie version.
B00005JL7Q|3.0|That's a nice movie but there is nothing which is creative. It is an enjoyable movie but I have seen better films of Hugh Grant.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|I don't do loooong reviews, so here is the short and sweet:  The movie is a decent sequel, but still falls short of the original.  Most people seem to agree that the early demise of Marie is dissappointing, to say the least.  And about the most notable feature of the rest of the film is that it really isn't notable.   <br /> <br />If I had never read the actual novel by Ludlum, I probably wouldn't have been as let down by this film.  The beauty of the books is the fact that they each have their own plot-line while simultaneously revolving around Jason Bourne/David Web's rivalry with Carlos \\"The Jackal.\\"  This film actually has NOTHING to do with the actual novel, having only used it's title (as was admitted by the filmmakers).  For instance, in the book, instead of being killed of early, Marie actually has a whole plotline that revolves around here exclusively, and in the end nearly single-handedly saves Jason/David's life.  Ummmm... just a tad different than we saw on the screen.  Too bad...  the plots of Ludlum's novels were awesome, and would have really translated well to the big screen.  As it is, they fall far short. <br /> <br />It's been a gorgeous summer.  My suggestion... skip sitting inside wasting 2 hours of your time.  Grab the novel, head outside, soak up some rays, and enjoy a great read!
B000001FA4|5.0|The Unforgettable Fire is (currently) my favorite U2 album, the one I like most to listen to  --- I think because I find it the most musical of their albums. More than any other album, I'm aware of how the band is working together, especially on \\"Bad.\\" The live version of \\"Bad\\" on \\"Wide Awake in America\\" is even better, but that album doesn't have much on it. Bono's voice becomes like one of the musical instruments, and The Edge's guitar is, for me, his best.
B000007U6V|5.0|If you are here, it is probably because you have some interest/newfound interest in Kraftwerk. Your open mindedness and good taste should be enough right? Well this album, (among the many they have) seems to be one of the better Kraftwerk albums.  <br /> <br />Considered as their last step before going completely electronic on Trans Europe Express, Autobahn still maintains the idea of what a Kraftwerk album should sound like, but it is more organic, (as there seems to be guitar, flute, and other organic noises in the recordings).  The beautiful track opener is a 22 minute ride that one must take completely. If your commute to school or work is that length or longer, I highly reccomend just putting Authobahn in and letting the cd take you were it needs to. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is complete genius as well. They begin songs with these organic underwater sounding interludes, almost having a creepy vibe to them,,,but then they would blast into an uplifting electronic melody and rhythms.  <br /> <br />The last track is best described as if you walked into some mystical garden in the Shire and mostly everything organic around you grew an electronic voice. Birds, water, everything transforms and Kraftwerk is in the background accompanying/creating these electronic vibes. To me this song is just soothing and great to relax to. <br /> <br />To close, if you have an open mind and are interested to listen to a transitional ( and the foundation for electronic music to come) Kraftwerk record, then purchase this album. It is beautiful, and while the melodies can be understood by pretty much anyone on this earth (Kraftwerk's universal appeal makes them on in a million I believe), their structures and genius can astonish even the profound music lover. This is one of those cd's where you have to listen front to back...the concept album Kraftwerk put forth is not a collection of songs, it is a musical journey that perfectly describes these young classicaly trained musicians getting tired of their acoustic roots and progressing into an electronic world that they set the foundation for.  <br /> <br />I can talk forever about Kraftwerk. Kudos to those who read this review and take something out of it. <br /> <br />-Andrew
0140177396|2.0|I honestly thought that this book by Steinbeck is pointless. It is so short, it really has not plot at all! Yes, it does show the value of friendship, and offers plenty of bookgroup discussion, but I was not thrilled. It really was much too short to go anywhere.
B0001NBMEE|3.0|Prince Valiant is a reminder of movie making of the 1950s, both its strengths and (at least perceived) weaknesses. Filmed in rich color, the story is one a child of those times now in his sixties can understand why he enjoyed it enough then to go to the theater four times (a large number of visits back then) to watch Valiant succeed against the Black Knight. It still has the action and large-horn helmeted Vikings to enchant the child that remains in a person of those times. But the film also seems to indicate that its intent was also part of a message in favor of the blacklisting and witch hunts of those times, as it repeatedly makes reference to Christians against heathens. At the same time, such battles were going on in Europe around the time of King Arthur, certainly they were a part of the literature of the times of early Arthurian legend. Maybe that's all there is to it and nothing more.
076790592X|5.0|I thought this was a fantastic book! It is so nice to a see a heartfelt book every once and a while. By the end of the story, I was close to crying. I strongly suggest you read this book...I am sure most of your friends already have. This is so good and short that you will be through it in no time!
B000001GBJ|5.0|The 'Songs From A Secret Garden' CD is rarely far from my CD player. The sounds of mystery and determination are heard in the tracks, and it provides an oasis in a busy world. It has become the background music for my meditations and writing. When I need time to get away, I go into my room, fire up the aromatherapy burner, and put on the CD. When it is done, I am able to face the world again.
1563894696|5.0|The Long Halloween is the ultimate Batman noir/detective/crime tale. A mysterious killer named \\"Holiday\\" is killing off mobsters and it's up to Batman, Gordon and Harvey Dent to stop him. Borrowing heavily from Year One, Long Halloween is a year long tale that leaves the reader guessing until the end. The strongest points of this story are the mystery of Holiday's real identity and Harvey Dent's slow descent into madness. Dent is actually the character who goes through the most development while Batman just tears through his entire rogues gallery. The Joker, Poison Ivy, Catwoman and more are using the chaos of Holiday's murders. Throw in a crime family that has been taken straight out of the Godfather movies, Jeph Loeb's amazing writing and Tim Sale's dark, moody pencils and you have an instant classic.
B00004VVNB|5.0|i just thought the whole movie was well done,and a very cool script.granted it is a little dated by today's standards,but what a movie for it's time. well worth having in your collection.
B0007G89G4|5.0|I purchased the Special Edition of this movie recently and couldn't believe that the audio was monophonic.  I was thus pleasantly surprised to see that in this edition of the DVD they restored the original multi-channel soundtrack.  Even the casual listener will notice the difference immediately. <br /> <br />To my knowledge the movie itself is the same as on the Special Edition (no added or cut scenes) so I won't waste your time commenting on that.  I just wanted to bring attention to the fact that the Deluxe Edition of this movie is the ONLY one any serious movie collector should consider.
B000002J09|4.0|Stairway To Heaven maybe the best song on the album and it is known as one of the best rock songs. Rock and Roll is also fantastic. If you have the money, buy it just for those 2.
006441034X|5.0|I enjoy Dianna Wynn Jones novels immensely. This book, like all of her work, was wonderful. It was fun, light, and at the same time had a good theme about love and loss. Not to mention, as always, it was very funny.
B0002VKZL6|1.0|Boom Like That is the only good song on this poor made CD! Dire<br /><br />Straits are way better!!!
0385338082|4.0|Although I love this author, I was disappointed in Shopaholic and Sister.  This book was so much fun to read, much like the first few Shopaholic books.
0375751513|5.0|Oscar Wilde was known for his outrageous takes on life (in terms of aesthetics, superficiality, beauty and the like). This book seems to both explore and satirise them. It is about the decadence and superficial pursuits of Dorian Gray, who is \\"ruined\\" by Lord Henry Wotton who teaches him that beauty and youth are the only true values. When Dorian's friend Basil paints a portrait of him, Dorian exclaims that he wished the portrait got old instead of him.<br /><br />This comes true and under further tutelage of Lord Henry, Dorian lives a life of debauchery, hedonism and the like while the portrait bears his age and sin, becoming more malformed with each act. The book is full of philosophical digressions on sin, beauty and indulgence and its most fabulous aspect is the fact that it is (or as least I think) both an ode to hedonism and an allegory against it all in one, all perfectly blended, all achieved through the medium of the witty writing of Wilde.
B00008438V|5.0|Pardon the incredibly rediculous title for this review. <br />First thing's first, the movie: John Hughes hit the mark again with this one. The script is great, and the actors all deliver it well. I love the, shall I say, \\"quirky\\" perfomances by most of the cast. It's definitely a movie worth watching if you're in the mood to be entertained. <br />Now the DVD: Well, for coming in a special box and everything, the High School Reunion Collection DVDs sure lack in bonus features. It's got all (or at least most?) of the original music, but that's about it. It's got previews for other movies, but who really wants that? So basically, it's a great movie but it's not much of a special DVD. If you're really into the extra stuff, then I guess you're out of luck. It's still worth buying in my opinion.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a quirky and absolutely terrific show.  I never understood why it was on Fox and not the Sci Fi channel.  Fox screwed the show from day one. <br />Looking forward to the movie in September 2005.
B000002KE2|5.0|For many years this was my favourite Sabbath release. It still ranks highly. Sabbath shifted in sound on this one and whether on purpose or by default ended up with a grunge album, IN 1972!! <br /> <br />Make no mistake about it this is just as heavy as Master of Reality but at the same time there is more diversity in sound, as Master being the masterpiece that it is, can still become tedious after a few listens because of its simplicity. <br /> <br />Nevertheless I still believe Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage to be more complete albums than this one. The 2 albums i've just mentioned go hand in hand in a way so you could say Volume 4 falls in a category all on its own within the catalogue of Ozzy era Sabbath. But by no stretch of the imagination is this a negative thing. <br /> <br />The album starts with wheels of confusion which i never really listen to as i usually skip to tommorrow's dream. However the last part of wheels of confusion is amazing. It almost has a western feel to it, Iommi sounding superb. Tommorrows dream is a straight foward mid-paced rocker which wouldn't be out of place on a soundgarden or even alice in chains album. Changes is emotional and way superior to the crap that Ozzy released with his daughter not too long ago. Supernaut is dominated by a riff that will grab you by the balls and won't let go and demonstrates why Bill Ward is one if not the best drummer in the history of rock. <br /> <br />Then we come to the highlight of the album for me. Snowblind is a classic Sabbath number about cocaine. Iommi's solos here are to be appreciated. I especially like the first one after the \\"my eyes are blind but I can see\\" segment- legendary. What a song! <br />Cornucopia rocks as does St Vitus Dance although I feel the latter is a low point on the album. Laguna Sunrise is a beautiful instrumental which funnily enough does not seem out of place on this album unlike fluff on SBS. Under The Sun is a hard, dark piece of music which you will still remember days after you've heard it. So heavy for 1972. Zeppelin and Purple could only dream of being so menacing, broody and heavy. A great song to end an excellent album. <br /> <br />GET THIS!! It is essential listening, not only if you are a Sabbath fan but also if you are a rock fan in general. I also believe fans of the early nineties grunge scene will enjoy this album as templates for that genre can be found within Volume 4 yet again demonstrating how Sabbath were light years ahead of their time.
0743454537|5.0|Imagine the horror of being told your child has a rare form of leukemia. Most likely, a parent would experience a myriad of emotions: fear, hurt, and anger. In My Sister's Keeper, the parents find hope in the knowledge that they can conceive a donor match for their terminally ill daughter, Kate. <br /> <br />Initially, it seemed the perfect solution. What parent wouldn't do whatever it takes to save their child's life? From the beginning of her life, Anna's (Kate's sibling and lifeline) sole purpose for existing is to keep Kate alive. Hearing Anna's perspective, I started to feel that the endless medical probing and prodding that she'd endured from birth was downright abusive. But on the other hand, I've never had to make such a decision so I tried to keep an open mind. <br />  <br />When Anna turns thirteen, she's expected to donate a kidney to her sister, an operation that is a great risk to both sisters. Anna rebels and gets an attorney. She wants to be medically emancipated from giving blood, bone marrow, and undergoing numerous surgeries.   <br /> <br />As the novel reached its conclusion, I had mixed emotions about practically everything in the book except my feelings regarding Sara, the mother of Kate, Anna, and older brother, Jesse. Sara seemed incapable of nurturing Anna and Jesse. Whenever Kate had a medical emergency, Sara became intolerant toward her other two children. Anna and Jesse's needs were not just an inconvenient annoyance (which is bad enough) but their needs were pereceived by Sara as \\"obscene.\\" Whew! That's pretty harsh. <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult took me on an emotional journey that I was completely unprepared for. And just when I thought I had come to a decision regarding my own view point regarding this sensitive subject matter, she left me speechless with something new to ponder.
B000005RFQ|4.0|... but be aware of the lame production. The bass is too loud, the guitars sound muddled and where are the drums? I've given this one 4stars as it is one of their better 80s efforts. Come on guys this is so much better than Headless Cross or Tyr.  <br /> <br />Gillan comes across superbly but then again the production ruins it.  <br /> <br />The riffs are crunchy and heavy on this one, better than those on H&H or even MR. Zero the Hero has got to be one of the best songs they have. Get this one over anything with Tony Martin on it. Don't get  me wrong Martin is one helluva vocalist but he's just not Sabbath. Born Again makes me think what could have been. A great band, an excellent vocalist, good tracks but the production lets this down badly. However, if you can look past this, this is truly a hidden gem in the Sabbath catalogue. After Dehumanizer, their heaviest album post-Ozzy.
0385338686|4.0|Sophie Kinsella has crafted a new character. Samantha Sweeting,whom I honestly can't identify with, but I sure can relate to the horror and embarrassment of bungling an important assignment. After causing the firm to lose a large sum of money, Samantha is filled with such angst, she starts experiencing panic attacks. While most of us (real-life,unfictional characters) would ferverently pray for a miracle while trying  to put up a brave front,we'd ultimately have to walk the proverbial plank, face the unmelodic music, and wait for the ax to fall. Samanatha, however, did what we'd all like to do under similar circumstances... RUN! HEAD FOR THE HILLS! And that's the part that made the story unrealistic, but oh so funny. I mean...really, an attorney turned scullery maid! I think not. But alas, it's only fiction and it was a lot of fun reading THE UNDOMESTIC GODDESS. It's a good summer read. Get it!
B000002KIK|3.0|Never Say Die! marked the end of the Ozzy led Sabbath. True, it is a shame that such an important era in hard rock music had to come to an end with what many deem are at best mediocre albums (Technical Ecstacy and Never Say Die. I however, beg to differ. Technical Ecstacy is a mediocre album but in my view this one rises above this. Never Say Die IS better than Technical Ecstacy because even though you can tell its a lazy effort by the Sabs, the songs are better both musically and lyrically than those on Technical Ecstacy (Rock n Roll Doctor, please!!) <br /> <br />One also needs to address the fact that the band were going through multiple problems as far as drugs and alcohol were concerned and the imminent depature of rock's best frontman of the 70's. Bearing this in mind one could even argue that Never Say Die is a damn good album. <br /> <br />If you are looking for early Sabbath or even a Sabbath Bloody Sabbath you won't find it here. Granted, NSD is experimental but is unique even in that way. Personally, I think Ozzy sounds good here, not exceptional as in Sabotage, but above average. The other band members sound okay but just about that. Knowing what they could deliver it does indeed sound lazy and lacklustre. But if you forget their first 6 albums and their undeniable quality, heaviness, depth and balls, NSD stands up on its own quite well really. Also, the more you listen to it the more you'll appreciate it. But for God's sake don't start your Sabbath collection here!!! <br /> <br />The title track is an all out fast paced rock song with great vocals and a great solo at the end. Johnny Blade is a good rocker with good riffs. The highlight of the album for me is Junior's Eyes which I believe is one of the best songs Sabbath have in their catalogue PERIOD especially because of the amazing chorus- Ozzy sounds great on this one. Hard Road is a good song as is Shock Wave. I never really cared much for Air Dance but contrary to public opinion I've always enjoyedthe laziness of Over To You. The last 2 tracks are indeed forgetable. <br /> <br />Three stars for this one folks. Not in  the league of Sabotage, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or even Mob Rules but not the creative nadir many make it out to be. A good, average album. Give it a chance.
0061015725|5.0|This book is definately one of Crichton's best.  It pulls you in immediately, and you can't put the book down until its finished!  The storyline behind this book like most Crichton novels is science based, and in particular (Nanoparticles) The beauty behind this book is that although it's a really good story that wants you to read about what would usually be a very dry subject!  And, the more I read now about nanoparticles the more I realize how this new world of very small particles will effect our everyday life.  The story itself is probably the best Crichton novel so far, and I've read quite a few of his.  I really don't want to give away the story line, but if you want a book that stretches your imagination, without becoming sci fi.... Then pick this one up.  He bases every assumption/theory/possibility on something or some technology that might exist or could possibly exist.  The realism adds termendously to the storyline.
0684135051|5.0|If you are just starting out and have been knitting less then a year, then this is the book for you.  Great tips and easy to follow directions!  It was a big help for me!
B00009V7P8|4.0|While this album is certainly different, (it includes a track with gospel-like chants and one with opera) it is a great listen.  I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't follow popular radio and who is looking for something exceptional and moving.
B00000JPH6|3.0|This movie frightened the living crap out of me when I was a child. In fact, it frightened me up untill a few years ago. These highly disturbing creatures are out of a nightmare, I don't know why anyone would think this was a good children's movie. The plot and characters are also a tad weak. But having said that, it is an interesting and very unique little movie. Worth checking out if you can handle the fear that the horrible Skeksis inspire.
0446310786|4.0|Even though 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is most definately one of the classics, it was a wonderful book that managed to keep my interest. One thing that struck me about this book was the absolutely amazing characterization. ALL of Harper Lee's characters are well thought out, and believable. I can easily see everyone, Atticus, Scout, Jem, Dill, even the Ewell's, as being a real, flesh-and-blood person.  <br /> <br />    The book tells the story of a few years in Scout and Jem's life. They spend their summers gallavanting about with Dill, making up plays and spying on the neighbourhood recluse, Boo Radley. Scout struggles with becoming a lady, while previous passtimes include beating up other children.  <br />    <br />    Then, Atticus takes on a case defending a black man of raping a white woman. The case throws the entire town into uproar. Scout and Jem now have to deal with the remarks of classmates, and disapproval from a part of the community.  <br />    <br />    'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a book essential to anyone's library, and would be a good choice to help educate people on racism in the past.

I've learned some excellent principles and so has my mom even though she is Born Organized and a Neat Freak.  I recommend this book to anyone feeling discouraged about their housekeeping and/or find their housekeeping interferes with family time, finding lost items,  or if you don't have any time to clean. <br />Have fun with your Fling Boogies.

B00003CXD5|5.0|Though the stage like background scenes can be distracting- <br />(especially in comparison to today's amazing special effects) <br />the performances between all these actor's is outstanding.Walter Huston got a well deserved oscar and so  <br />should have Bogie.This also is probably John Huston's best  <br />writing for screen work.A dark but wonderful movie.
B00005JNJT|5.0|As a lifelong Batman fan, I tend to be very critical of any attempts at filmed adaptations of the character.  In the case of Batman Begins, there is little to criticize, which coming from me is high praise.    Here we see Gotham City as a quasi-realistic urban jungle in which organized crime has taken over.  Having suffered a 'Depression,' Gotham has never recovered.  Most of the police force is under the influence of mob boss Carmine Falcone, played with gusto by Tom Hutchison.  Bruce, Alfred, Gordon, and few others believe that there is hope.  Batman emerges as that hope in the second act of the film.  We see him as human, which is crucial in relating to the character.  He makes mistakes.  His 'toys' are explained very nicely.  And at the end of the film we want to see him continue.  Speaking of which, wait for the excellent sequel set-up.    The story matches the tone of several comic book stories of the last 19 or so years, most notably the work of Frank Miller.  Here we see Christian Bale as a very focused, obsessed, determined Bruce Wayne, who blossoms into the weird and scary Batman.  It is Bale who really makes this movie work.  He fleshes out the many aspects of Bruce Wayne: the playboy act, the driven kid who sees vengeance robbed from under him, and the guy who finds satisfaction in thwarting the criminal element.  Michael Caine is stunning as Alfred, Morgan Freeman is a breezy pleasure as engineer genius Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman gives a note-perfect performance as Jim Gordon, and Cillian Murphy is just creepy as Crane/Scarecrow.  Rounding out the cast is Liam Neeson, whose performance is more complicated, but he certainly does a commendable job.    From production design to acting to script to direction, this is a great, fun film!  The Batmobile gets a bizarre but cool redo; we see the cave as a realistic, dank hideaway, and the suit gets a decent explanation.  On film, Batman doesn't get much better than this!    Here's hoping that Batman Continues!  Final Grade: A+
B0009MDPYM|5.0|I was surprised that overall vote gave Constantine only two and a half stars which I think this movie does not deserve, because it's worthy of more. <br /> <br />Keanu Reeves, who plays the main role in the movie, is fit well for the role of Constantine, and plays very profesionally. <br /> <br />The whole idea of the movie, is is based on the thought of angels and daemons, the God and the Devil. Constantine appears in this movie to be the one sending the deamons back to hell, therefore repaying all his sins with God, so that he can go to Heaven in his afterlife. <br /> <br />He helps a girl find out the truth behind her sister's supposed sucide, which everyone but her believes that she comitted.  <br /> <br />The special effects in the movie, which are included in scenes where Constatine confronts these half-bloods are very good. The camera work in the movie is done very well. <br /> <br />The plot of \\"Constantine\\" has lots of mystery and dark themes. If you wish to omit that, than this movie is not for you. However, if you support the idea and the religious beliefs of the director, I would recommend this movie to you. <br /> <br />Thanks,  <br /> <br />mirage
B0000009S3|5.0|Probably one of the best albums to listen to front to back.  Inside the album cover, Frank writes, \\"It's like a movie for your ears\\", and that best describes the whole album.  He is a true musical genius.
0385335482|5.0|The first 50 pages or so started off a little slow, but after that I couldn't put it down!  I haven't laughed out loud while reading in quite a while, but with all of Becky's mishaps - it's impossible not to.  LOVED it!
0156027321|5.0|<br />Pi Patel is a thoughtful young man. His pursuit of an understanding of the world leads him to practice Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. He is well-mannered, intelligent and an unwilling participant in one of the most harrowing journeys ever examined in a novel. The ability of Yann Martel to keep this story of a boy and a tiger on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean fascinating and plausible is nothing short of amazing. This examination of what it takes to survive, both physically and mentally in the direst of circumstances, might make this novel a welcome addition to the \\"tales of survival genre,\\" but that does not do the book justice. Only a great work of fiction is able to present so many concepts worthy of examination, questions on the nature of life, faith, and what makes us human. There are so many concepts and ideas addressed in these pages, from beginning to end, that the book is much more than a tale of survival; it is a tale that captures the essence of what it is to be human. <br />
B0000508U6|4.0|Music is highly subjective. This recording just struck a chord with me. I give it 4 stars because, I know, I do not know enough about the technical aspects of music composition to rate it as the best all around. It has provided some great sounds for me. I really enjoy it.
B000000OAN|5.0|<br />A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is where Queen was able to tie together the various components that made them original into a package that made them popular. Starting with the pure vitriol of \\"Death on Two Legs,\\" ANATO creates what would prove to be Queen's signature sound. Mix a few quirky numbers that sound like they're from the days of the music hall, (\\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\\" \\"Seaside Rendezvous\\") a few Brian May lyrical brainteasers, (\\"Good Company\\" \\"'39\\") and a couple of numbers that will touch the heart. (\\"You're My Best Friend,\\" \\"Love of My Life\\") and the rockers \\"I'm in Love with My Car,\\" \\"Sweet Lady,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Death,\\" and you have the basic format for Queen's popularity. Throw in the last of Queen's fantasy based compositions, the haunting  sonic adventure of \\"The Prophet's Song,\\" and the band's magnum opus,  Bohemian Rhapsody\\" which shows the band at the height of their powers, an over the top vocal masterpiece, with  a pseudo operatic feel that was a true original, and you have the definitive Queen album. While not my personal favorite, (That would be JAZZ) this one best defines the band's individuality and its place in rock history. <br />
0156029065|4.0|This book is sort of like Forrest Gump for medievalists: your narrator's bona fides are in serious question, but if he's telling the truth (whatever THAT means), the history of the European 12th century is more or less all about him.   <br /> <br />For those in the know, all the great political movements and hoaxes are Baudolinorian: Prester John, the Grail literature, the Courtly Love lyrics, the Third and Fourth Crusades, the politics of Frederick Barbarossa, and on and on.   <br /> <br />If you're not really in the know about the period, this won't be much fun unless you like Googling a great deal.
B000000OAA|3.0|<br />Moving away from the fantasy so prevalent on their first two albums, \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" definitely sounds like a band in transition. A few of the numbers sound like they're designed for live shows like, \\"Brighton Rock\\" with its prolonged guitar solo, including feedback, and \\"Now I'm Here,\\" a song that begs for an audience response. Deacon makes his first appearance as songwriter with two numbers that, despite their brevity, give an idea of what type of songs he'll bring to the group later on. \\"Bring Back Leroy that Leroy Brown\\" touches on the British music hall sound that will be put to better use on A NIGHT AT THE OPERA and the general sound is one of a band reaching for a sound but not quite getting there. Two stand outs make you feel that Queen is pretty close to finding their sound, \\"Killer Queen, which sounds like a trial run for \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"Stone Cold Crazy,\\" filled with an antic energy that Queen has shown earlier, but this time with a bit more focus. I don't find as many memorable songs on this one, but it seems a needed step in the band's development. <br />
B000001EYO|3.0|It was pretty good, but not as good as I remember when I watched the film.  \\"Just dropped in\\" is a bright spot, as is a good cover of a Rolling Stones song.
B000000OAH|5.0|<br />JAZZ is Queen at its best. What other band is willing to open up with an Arabic rocker (\\"Mustapha\\") and then kick into the wickedly funny \\"Fat Bottomed Girls?\\" The CD shifts from the plaintive cry of pain on \\"Jealousy\\" to the truly surreal \\"Bicycle Race,\\" (Which still holds up despite the dated references) without pause. Rockers like \\"Dead on Time\\" and \\"Fun It\\" share space evenly with Deacon's self-help numbers and Mercury's totally over the top \\"Let Me Entertain You.\\" That last song sums this CD up pretty well. I'm sure for some this one is too much of a mixed bag, with Queen visiting a variety of genres, but I feel this one encapsulates the band at its best; multi-talented and not afraid of taking more than a few chances.  <br /> <br />
0767827791|4.0|In Kim Novak's first major film, the viewer is treated to a beautiful ingenue--completely sweet and innocent.  William Holden is the perfect drifter--mysterious and incredibly sexy.  When they meet, the chemistry is immistakable and nothing can stop them from consummating their attraction.  This film was very progressive for the time it was made, but is quite tame by today's standards. The dance scene is unforgettable, and the supporting actors are memorable.<br /><br />The best part of this film is the ending, because even then you are not certain what will become of these two people and their future.  I especially enjoy films that linger with you after viewing them, and this is one that does.  If you are at all a romantic, this is a great film for you.
B0002858YS|5.0|The best way to describe \\"Hot Fuss\\" is \\"re-imagined 80s music\\". You will hear hints of a variety of 80s musicians from the Smiths/Morrissey to early Duran Duran sounds. But this album stands very well on its own, both musically and lyrically. <br /> <br />[I am using \\"Re-imagined\\" in a similar context as the new tv show Battlestar Galactica is a re-imagined version of the old one from the late 70s]. <br /> <br />The 1st half of the album is stronger than the 2nd half, but overall it is a great unit of work.  <br /> <br />A rule of thumb indicator of a great album is if the best song on the album is not one of the singles. And in this case, in my opinion, the best song of the album is not one of the singles.
B00005JM02|5.0|\\"Finding Nemo\\", the fifth in the Pixar line and its first Oscar winner for Best Animated Film, is easily their best-looking movie. The underwater milieu and detail, both for the dozens of fish characters and settings (the anemones look very inviting and comfortable), is beautifully done- you really feel that the ocean's come to life. Kudos to Andrew Stanton, the primary director/writer (and a native of salty Cape Ann, MA), who must have some salt water in his blood.  <br />       This is one of the few animated or family movies where the main character's a dad. He's Marlin (voiced, in a pleasantly neurotic way, by the oft-brilliant Albert Brooks), an orange clown fish who's ready to follow Nemo- his little son, born without a mother (who was eaten by sharks)- to the ends of the ocean after he swims away from his school and gets netted up by a diver who turns out to be...an Australian dentist! Soon, Marlin is joined by Dory (voiced, brilliantly, by the very likable Ellen DeGeneres- and even sporting bright, Ellen-esque eyes), a pretty blue tang fish who loves to talk but has memory problems. Together, they follow the reef, with adventures involving rowdy Aussie-accented sharks, surfing sea turtles, and even a whale. Eventually, they reach the familiar, breathtaking skyline of Sydney Harbour (remember the 2000 Olympics?), where Nemo's in the dentist's fish tank. Whether you're 5 or 95, you'll love swimming along with them. <br />        Pixar will always have my respect for never repeating itself, and \\"Finding Nemo\\" has its own look and feel. Supporting characters, many of whom have Australian accents and are voiced by dinkum Aussie stars (Barry Humphries as Bruce the shark, Geoffrey Rush as Nigel the swooping pelican), are not only distinctive but realistic. The dialogue between Marlin (Brooks) and Dory (Ellen D.) could pass for a legit romantic comedy; it's the best interplay by any two Pixar characters. Add a moody,  <br />\\"underwater\\" score by Thomas (Randy's cousin) Newman and it even sounds aquatic.  <br />        As with all Pixar packages, the 2-DVD set has some notable features, including both widescreen (always my preference) and fullscreen views. More than, say, \\"The Incredibles\\", the extras seem geared to kids; young Alexander Gould (Nemo's voice) visits the Pixar studio departments on a scooter and Mr. Ray (leader of Nemo's school) narrates a sea-creature encyclopedia. My favorite extra is a Jean-Michel Cousteau look at real reef life; he's constantly interrupted by Marlin and Dory, \\"swimming\\" into the underwater shots. It has, to me, a fun outtake feel; kids will just want to see the characters. (Cousteau's treated with more respect by Steve Hillenberg on the \\"SpongeBob Movie\\" DVD.) <br />        \\"Finding Nemo\\" isn't my favorite Pixar movie, but they don't know how to make a bad one. It's so pretty and relaxing to watch, you might not even notice that it's funny too- for kids of all ages. Take the plunge!

0792163710|5.0|Here is the great story of the outcast come to rescue the society from which he's been banned. Shane (Alan Ladd) is a gunfighter with a past he can't forget (though he tries) who comes to Joe Starett's farm and helps him and other homesteaders to keep their land from the open-rangers. He is idolized by Starett's little boy Joey, even falls in love with his wife (Jean Arthur) - and she with him; but when the bad guys bring a hired gunfighter (Jack Pallance) into town to fight for them, Shane reluctantly puts his own guns back on and does what he has to do before riding off (with a bullet in him) - branded forever by his past. Ladd is perfect in the role of Shane. When another independent old cowboy tells him their days are through, Ladd says, \\"Yes, but I know it.\\" Here is the Western rebel: the victim with no place left to go. A great movie in the western genre. Definitely worth a watch.
B00018D44U|1.0|In a few more years, noone will think about or mention Norah Jones at all.  She had one hit, got the Grammy, and evaporated in a vast sea or mediocre singer/songwriters.

0765310015|3.0|I'm still not sure exactly how to rate this book.  Once I got used to it, it wasn't hard to read, but you can't read it quickly.  A huge cast of characters (some of whom disappear and re-appear very abruptly) threatens to overwhelm the narrative.  Because there are so many people, there's no time to gift them with a back story or even describe them physically, so it's left up to the reader to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />There's certainly plenty of action.  Things happen continuously, but again it's left up to the reader to puzzle out who's who.  The cast of characters and glossary are helpful, but one is in the front of the book and the other's in back, and you'll find yourself stopping to flip to the front, then to the back, just to get a hint of what might be going on.  This makes the reading process something of a chore.<br /><br />I've started the second volume, \\"Deadhouse Gates\\", but it gets only more confusing, as very few of the characters from the first book are carried over, and you're left to puzzle out where/who/what/why on your own.  Writers shouldn't have to spell everything out, but how about a few clues (other than the glossaries)?<br /><br />Several plot threads disappear as abruptly as the characters.  A mage named Hairlock is dying on the battlefield; another mage transfers his life force into a marionette (!) only to destroy him a few hundred pages later.  Why rescue Hairlock at all?  Perhaps Erikson doesn't know, either.<br /><br />And that's just one example.<br /><br />On the other hand, I did finish it and haven't given up on the second book quite yet, because Erikson's writing is strong and I'm still curious to see if he really knows what he's doing or whether he's just messing around.  It's hard to tell at this stage.  There's a wonderful weirdness to it all, but for me it would work much better if we knew something about the characters and Erikson wasn't going out of his way to be so obscure.<br /><br />His writing has frequently compared to George R. R. Martin, but I'm certainly not looking forward to the rest of the series as I am with GRRM's work.  Martin is able to build a complex plot and world with richly developed characters, and it's all sparklingly clear, without spoon-feeding or repeating information.  Erikson seems to take pride in giving you as little information as possible, and is a much tougher challenge to read.frequently compared to George R. R.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|this movie is far from funny and dvd special features aside and quality sound and video, this movie is dumb and I would not recomend even renting it save your money or buy a film with class. I tried to watch it twice and after giving it a chance I could still find no redeeming qualities.  Every body who I have spoken to who enjoyed the film are under 21 years old, every one else hated it.  I hate this movie and thats hard to believe because I like some pretty stupid movies.
038572179X|5.0|Ian McEwan has written many beautiful books, but this tops them all. The book is one of the most captivating ones that I read and easily beats the Booker winner \\"True History of the Kelly Gang\\". It is divided into two parts, the youth and the adult. When young, Robbie Turner and Brionie Tallis are placed in unusual surroundings. Both are going through changes. Robbie is an intelligent adult who lives in the Tallis family where his mother works as a housemaid. He is in love with Cecilia, the oldest daughter of the family. Though he is an intellectual, he is placed in unusual settings as he understands the class distinctions of the day and does not know how to react to them. Briony is a dreamer who sets up the play \\"Trials of Arabella\\" to welcome her brother who comes with a stupid and rich businessman. By the end of the day, Robbie and Cecilia understand their love for each other. However, a rape happens in the family and Briony blames Robbie for it. <br /> <br />Here the second part of the book starts where Robbie signs up for the army and is released from prison. The only thing that keeps him alive is their love. This is beautifully portrayed in the book. Briony grows up in age and mentally and signs up to be a nurse. The parts about the war are extremely well written without melodrama and due to great research by the author in the British War Museum. Briony realizes the mistake she has done and requests to see her sister. Her sister cuts herself from the family after they do not stand up for Robbie on the basis of a kid's accusal. The book shows many things, the gradual changes in England, the growing up of the people, the cruelty among children and how people try to make up for their mistakes. As in all McEwan's midlife work, a private drama of loss of innocence or betrayal is played out against a larger history of bad faith. When Briony meets her sister, she sees Robbie there who rightly gets mad at her. This part is one of the best and the saddest. When he charges her with what she did, she agrees with him and says what changed her was \\"Growing up.\\" This outrages him more, \\"How much more growing up do you have to do?\\" Unfortunately, the person who did the error could not be charged, that is one of life's ironies. The novel comes together beautifully and can be read any number of times for its different pieces - irony, romance, war, passion and even comedy. Though the overall tone is sad, it has a satisfying feeling that I did not get from most of his books. I would put it down to one of the best books I have read in recent times.
B00003CX8U|5.0|Really really good. Meet Joe Gideon; choreographer, perfectionist, drug addict, sleazy, and extraordinarly talented. It really holds your attention. The music, dance, and imagery are creative and obviously inspired. The special magical sequences are incredible. A man victimized by his own narrow lust, now faceing lifes end. The weird life of a weird dude, shortened by his denial of mortality. He tries to enlist the aid of strangers to supply him with alcohol and cigarettes and drugs while in the hospital. \\"Bye bye life. Bye bye sweet caress. Bye bye lonliness. I think I'm gonna die.

B00005JKJA|5.0|With the exception of \\"The Elephant Man,\\" I've always loved the style of David Lynch, but rarely enjoyed the stories he brought to the screen.  If anyone wants the definition of abstract filmmaker - David Lynch is the answer.  Lynch allows his imagination to spin wild and create some of the most vivid works of visual art.  \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" a film that will toy with your sense of reality and draw you into the film's world, is Lynch's benchmark.    This bizarre tale begins as a woman (played by Laura Elena Harring) is riding in the back of a limo, only to notice that the driver stops to draw a silenced pistol, and is suddenly rescued (in a way) when a speeding car crashes into the limo.  After she wakes up, she wanders into a condo complex, and stays in one that is apparently vacated for the moment.    This sounds simple on paper, but before the movie reaches that little plot point, we are introduced to a multitude of colorful characters, including a detective (Robert Forster) who seems to have no purpose other than to make us acknowledge, \\"Wow, I really enjoy a scene when a detective is on the scene of the crime.\\"  There are mysterious individuals, of seemingly powerful stature, who loom in the shadows and communicate with vague phone calls.    The character that will advance the story (or sequence of events, as I'm not sure this is really a plot), is Betty (Naomi Watts), an aspiring actress who enters the dreamlike world of Hollywood.  She soon enters the habitat that Harring's character has been hiding in, and discovers her sensuous figure in a shower.  Apparently, \\"Rita\\" has amnesia, which Betty sees as an opportunity to embark on an adventure to discover her past.    The film goes in many spirals after that.  Justin Theroux portrays Adam Kesher, a director who's blackmailed into making compromises with more strange people, catches his infidelious wife with a pool cleaner (Billy Ray Cyrus?), and shares an unforgettable glance with Betty.  A random assassinationattempt gone awry only makes sense within the last 10 minutes of the movie.  I could go on and on about the oddities of \\"Mulholland Drive\\", but I'll leave you to discover.    Many reviewers and critics have ruined the infamous 'TWIST' in the film.  I refuse to do so.  If you don't know what it is, breathe easy---you can't predict anything in this surreal moviegoing experience.     I would be lying if I said that this film is for everybody, but since when has a David Lynch film ever been?  I can guarantee that you will never forget the emotional impact and dizzying strucutre of this masterpiece.  David Lynch surely has the answers to this riddle of a mystery.  But he is not interested in the concrete answers.  He wants us to view this work of art and come up with our own conclusions.  He's not doing this to be self-concious, but he wants us to create our own sympathies and relations to the characters.  In whatever reality we perceive any film to exist in, what happens on the screen is still open to our interpretation...and Lynch embraces that with open arms.

B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Gilmore Girls is one of my favorite TV shows.  If you're a mother with a daughter, or a daughter who had any kind of relationship with your mother, you can relate to this show.  It has something for everyone.  The fast moving dialoge keeps you listening closly so you won't miss anything.  I think the actors were all well cast for these rolls and do a great job. I plan on buying each year of the show as they are made available.
1559408855|2.0|Okay. When I got this CD, I steeled myself for the horrors to come based on other reveiws.<br /><br />Sadly, I found none of what I had been expecting.<br /><br />I will say though that as a storyteller, Pasolini does manage to grab you in a way that makes you think..good lord. He does a superb job of showing the four Administors as being utterly debaseless and with little remorse; and he does a great job of making the victims seem to be walking around in a dream state unsure of what is happening to them or why. I do think, however, that previous recants of the actors being wooden and incapable of emoting is quite wrong, note the poor thing that weeps at her mother's loss. The guards and victims themselves show quite a good deal of emotion when they need to.<br /><br />  But as for this movie being as gut wrenching and horrific as the Marquis original tale, it falls very short. I found that it dragged in many places, and the aging prostitutes tales were inspid and unispiring. Were it me, I might have made flashback scenes to depict the tales through I readily admit finding an adult actress to play a child is impossible. I would also have set it in the era of Sade himself rather than in Italy, but that's just me.<br /><br />So two stars for this one: If you're looking for extreme violence or XXX rated material, this DVD isn't for you. Try one of the Cannibal Holocaust films instead.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have never seen a movie as intensley astounding in performance as that of \\"The Passion Of The Christ\\".  I am 39 years old and I cannot find the words to express to anyone the expanse, magnitude and brilliance that this movie of The Final hours of Jesus Christ has left within me other than an imprint  as deep within as the mystery of the universe itself.   <br /> <br />As a young catholic growing up, I remember seeing the movie on TV called, \\"Francis of Assisi\\", starring Bradford Dillman, Dolores Hart (who became an actual nun in 1971) and Stuart Whitman.  It was and is one of the greatest movies in the history of Religious Film Making with The Passion of The Christ as Number One and Francis as Number two.  No film of St. Francis or any kind then, made such an impression on me, that I actually took His name as mine for my Confirmation Name because I became so \\"hypnotized\\", if you will, that I became more aware that anyone can desire such holiness and attain such (Holy) Valor as Francis did, for me, when I was only 11.  <br /> <br />Buy this film!!  See \\"The Passion of The Christ\\" Come Alive for you as you have never seen anything like it ever before!!! <br />So that to see for yourselves what Jesus went through in His Final Hours for our redemption and to accomplish for us something so beautiful through such anguish and pain never before witnessed, that to this day, as I hold the DVD in my hands still unwrapped since I saw it on The Big Screen, it remains in me, as if imprinted on my very soul.   <br /> <br />Maybe a person may see this film as an atheist and leave it as an atheist, but I know one thing.  They will never die as one, as it is said, likewise, that \\"there are no atheists in fox holes\\". <br /> <br />Peace of \\"The Christ\\" be with you! <br />RJ
B000002UAX|2.0|It's ironic that this is called \\"Beatles\\" since it is more a bunch of solo performances with the other Beatles used as a back-up band. Remember when George Martin suggested strings for \\"Yesterday\\" and Paul said, \\"As long as it's not that Montovani crap\\"? Well, the funny thing about it is, there is some Montovani crap on this record, but it is on a Lennon song. This had to have been a joke.   It always cracks me up when people disparage the solo McCartney stuff and then give this record rave reviews. If you like novelty songs, buy this cd. Otherwise borrow it and record the five or six good songs. George Martin is said to have pushed for this to be a single album. He had it half right. There are enough good songs on this to make one side of an album. If you take the good songs from the Pepper album and the good songs from this album, you would have a four-star album.  Buy \\"Meet the Beatles\\" instead of this cd; its much better.
B00078XKDE|5.0|Wow. And really, really wow, not just 'cos it's like the album's name. This one's a stunner. No Wow is the sort of album that after one listen might not impress much. Then you listen again, and again, and it quickly becomes a favourite. Or at least it has for me.  <br />Having heard 4 or 5 of the album tracks already, I knew what to expect. But I really isn't until you listen to the whole album that you hear such songs as lead single 'The Good Ones' and forthcoming single 'Love Is A Deserter', in context, at their best. Every song literally bristles with sexiness, with tension, as VV's moaning, strained vocals hover perfectly matched to Hotel's fuzzy guitar. Surely, if ever there was a match made in heaven, this was it. <br />It's an album on which you have to take a long, long time to choose stand out tracks. For me, it's the songs where VV really lets loose, where you hear what she can really do with that voice of hers. On 'Rodeo Town', the most calm and, in my opinion, most beautiful, of all the album's songs, VV's vocals are gorgeous, the song itself is amazing. 'Sweet Cloud' is notable for its particularly bitter chorus 'I know no words to fix my killing, but I'd do anything to bring my brother alive', and its nagging hook, that will absolutely stick in your head for days.  <br />Now I've only mentioned the end half of the album so far, where the beginning is equally as good. The first 5 songs are just full of tension, the sort of pent up rock music that just makes you wanna pick up a guitar, or have sex, or drink, a lot. Something extreme anyway. As a record's beginning, they really knock you for six. Single 'The Good Ones' is the singular most sex-filled song I've ever known, it just bristles with energy, and it's dark lyrics really shine amongst The Kills' other babies. Then there's 'Dead Road 7' - phwoar, that girl can't half yell. It's a real shocker this one, but absolutely beautiful all at once. Future single 'Love Is A Deserter' asks us to 'Get the gunsout' repeatedly, to a point where the message is so much hammered home that it is tempting to, indeed, get a gun out. Title track 'No Wow' really does deserve a wow, after all, what other song could pull off the first line: 'Gonna have to step over my dead body, before you walk out that door.' Now that, my friends is real music. <br />Then, what other band could pull off this record? The Kills have successfully created a stand out album, which will be a definitive album this year. It's sexual, it's tense, it's taut, it's bare, sparse, torn apart, put back together again and bloody well put in a dual case for your listening pleasure.  <br />Now THAT's music. Again, altogether now, WOW.  <br />
B00062RCBW|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite TV shows. I'm so thrilled to finally own the series on DVD, as I haven't been able to watch it for the last ten years. Every time I moved somewhere new, I would eagerly get my cable hooked up, only to be crushed when I found out that TNG was not part of the line-up. (There were times when I was on holiday that I would refuse to leave the hotel room, because I was finally able to catch a TNG episode, and I wasn't leaving until it was over!) <br /> <br />I started watching it in 1992 because I had a crush on Wesley Crusher (lame, I know, but hey, I was eleven!) So I was watching it because I thought that he was cute, but after about three episodes, I was completely hooked on the show itself. The storylines are just so awesome, and full of the kind of moral standards that define the human race. Where else can you find another show that upholds so many positive messages, about truth and freedom and honor and the beauty of being human, even with all of its hardships, and . . .the list goes on and on. Yes, there are a couple of \\"stinkers\\", (The Naked Now, Masks) but there are few and far between. I guess every series is allowed to fail once or twice.(I recommend skipping over The Naked Now - I can't stand this episode - it's like watching a cheap porno movie! Not that I watch those, mind you!) <br /> <br />One of the people who worked on the show remarked that each episode is like half of a feature film, and he's absolutely right. Not many shows can be so moving in 45 minutes, but STNG manages it. I have found myself crying by the end of the show so many times, (if you're familiar with The Inner Light, you'll understand what I mean.) It's just that moving. And of course, sometimes there are points when I've had to pause playback, because I'm laughing so hard (often at a moment where Data makes an unintentionally hilarious comment). And of course the Q episodes are some of the best for comedy. (Watch Deja Q if you want to laugh your head off - as far as I'm concerned, no one can watch Data having his first belly laugh without cracking up.) <br /> <br />I bought this set as my bonus for the year, while my husband got a new computer. So the DVDs were technically supposed to be mine, but now my husband won't let me watch them without him there! (Well, he would let me, of course, but he doesn't want to miss an episode.) He had only seen maybe a handful of TNG episodes before I purchased this set. He was more of a Voyager fan, as that was what was on TV at the time that he started to become a Trekkie. But after watching maybe ten TNG episodes, he had to agree that TNG absolutely blows Voyager away. (I did give that show a chance, I watched it for almost three months when it first started, but it just didn't have the heart of TNG.) <br /> <br />We bought this set less than two months ago, and already, we're halfway through season six! We have to be watching about 3-4 episodes a night, and as many as eight on the weekends. We just can't stop, they're that good. <br /> <br />As you can guess, I was too young to really enjoy the original series. They were before my time. I've seen a few, but they were a bit too cheesy for me. Plus, after Captain Picard, I couldn't like the cowboy style of Kirk. TNG is what I grew up with. <br /> <br />Now I'm looking forward to owning Deep Space Nine. (I don't like it as much as TNG, but it's still good.) Voyager and Enterprise, I might what the occasional show if it happens to be on TV, but TNG can be watched over and over. I'll never tire of it. <br /> <br />I would recommend getting a companion guide to go with the set. I have TV Guide's \\"Farewell to Star Trek: The Next Generation\\". Not too easy to get your hands on, but very good. It includes a synopsis of every single episode, including the names of the guest stars and a few trivia tidbits. The book also has interviews of every regular cast member, even a few that weren't in that many episodes, like Q and Ensign Ro. It may be a little difficult to get your hands on a copy (try Ebay, as Amazon doesn't have it), but it's well worth it. <br /> <br />Also, it's been said over and over, but beware of the Asian releases! It's cheaper, but the picture and sound quality sucks, and many of the episodes are cut off at the end. It may not be enough missing to leave you hanging, but who wants that? While the Amazon price might seem steep, it works out to less than $3.50 US an episode, while getting the bonus stuff for free. (I'm from Canada, but even with the exchange rate, it worked out to less than $4.50 Canadian for an episode, with the bonus stuff for free.) When you look at it that way, it doesn't seem so bad. It was an \\"ouch\\" to part with the money, but at least this way, I'll own the whole show forever, and now I can watch any episode anytime. Also, buy the whole set at once, rather than individual seasons, you'll save yourself $150-$200. And you'll get a nice little sleeve to store them all in. <br /> <br />The surround sound on this set is just awesome. If you have surround sound, you will love watching it like this.  <br /> <br />There's only a couple of things that I would change about this set if I could. I would have liked to have seen some bloopers as part of the extras. DVD commentary would also have been appreciated. And I would have changed the packaging to an accordian style (like a book) foldout. The way it is now, you have to unfold the holder across your coffee table so that you can get the last disc out. It's rather annoying. And sometimes, the disc holder doesn't want to come out of the box. Also, the DVD chapters aren't set up so that you can just click past the credits (I did that once, then wondered why I'd missed part of the episode). But other than that, everything else is great. I have every single episode, to watch anytime that I want. No more waiting for the occasional show on a friend's satellite system! <br /> <br />Favorite episodes: <br />The Best of Both Worlds, parts I and II <br />The Inner Light <br />I, Borg <br />Tapestry <br />Yesterday's Enterprise <br />The Measure of a Man <br />The Offspring <br />Who Watches the Watchers? <br />The Pegasus <br />Deja Q <br />Remember Me <br />Reunion <br />Clues <br />The Host <br />Disaster <br />Ethics <br />Gambit, parts I and II <br />The First Duty <br />The Hunted
0205313426|5.0|There is no substitute for greatness.  \\"Strunk & White\\" has been the best guide to the English language and its grammar for at least the 40+ years that I've been using it.  I used it while writing my Ph.D. dissertation and taught with it in my college-level English classes for years.  Alas, I no longer teach, but I still use it regularly.  I highly recommend this gem!
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I ordered this for my son, he had seen all the newer Star Wars movies and loved them.  The DVDs got to my home quickly and in great condition.  My son also got another treat, in the bonus DVD there is a game demo for Xbox and another type of console.  This is a great item for yourself or to give as a gift.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Any fans of South Park, Cannibal The Musical, Orgazmo or any other Matt Stone/Trey Parker adventures must see this movie in it's un-cut glory.  It is entirely worth it, because what they do with puppets is probably (hopefully) a once in a lifetime show that you just have to see.
B000002GQH|4.0|The third of their \\"classic 7\\" albums, On the Threshold of a Dream was one of two albums that the Moody Blues would release during 1969.  The general feel is more subdued and laid back than its grandiose predecessor, In Search of the Lost Chord, and this is appropriate because the themes of this album centre on dreams, imagination and personal identity.  Although it is probably the least essential of the \\"classic 7,\\" it would become the band's first number 1 album in Britain. <br /> <br />The concept of On the Threshold of a Dream is not as prominent as the concepts for the band's previous two albums, but it is clearly there at the beginning and the end of the record, with the eerie opening and closing shimmer of the mellotron suggesting a dream-like state.   The creepy and unusual opener, Graeme Edge's In the Beginning, also explores the theme, as does his other poetic contribution, The Dream.  Elsewhere, the beautiful Justin Hayward/Ray Thomas collaboration Are You Sitting Comfortably evokes memories of childhood stories and Arthurian legend, and Mike Pinder's epic closing suite, consisting of Have You Heard parts 1 and 2 and The Voyage, is wonderfully atmospheric and dream-like.  A tour de force for Pinder's mellotron playing, these closing three tracks are probably the highlight of the album. <br /> <br />There are other very good songs here, which are less obviously to do with the concept. Most notable are Hayward's bouncy Lovely to See You, an excellent pop tune, and another of his trademark yearning ballads, the sublime Never Comes the Day;  these two tracks showcase Hayward's skill at writing both slow and fast numbers. Ray Thomas also demonstrates his unique songwriting skills with the downbeat and bleakly humorous Dear Diary and Lazy Day, an excellent evocation of the traditional British Sunday. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, however, the album isn't quite as consistent as the Moodies' other releases between 1967 and 1972.  This is mainly because of a weak middle section consisting of two forgettable John Lodge songs and an uncharacteristically lightweight contribution from Pinder, So Deep within You. Despite this, the quality of the rest of the album means On the Threshold of a Dream is still well worth a listen, and no self-respecting Moody Blues fan should be without it.
B0009P42S2|5.0|Steamboy is the latest entry into the Steampunk subgenre, speculative fiction that presents an alternate historical setting of the Victorian era in which modern technological advances were invented earlier in history through the assistance of steam-era technology. Early fiction like Jules Vernes' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling's novel, The Difference Engine and Alan Moore's popular comic book, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comic book are perhaps some of the best known examples of this subgenre. Gibson's Cyberpunk fiction had a profound influence on one of director Katsuhiro Otomo's previous anime movies, Akira, one of the greatest animated films ever made. Steamboy sees him influenced by Gibson's fiction again as he wrestles with some of the same themes, such as man vs. technology that he explored in Akira while maintaining the same level of quality animation.<br /><br />Otomo's film explores the differing views of science. Ray's grandfather believes that only the fruits of advances in science should be available to the educated and the privileged while his father believes it should be shared with everyone as he says at one point, \\"Science exists as a power to be used in reality.\\" He believes it should be used to improve all of humanity, not just a small portion of it.<br /><br />Watching this movie only reinforces how bad The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen movie is compared to its original source material and the Steampunk genre in general. Steamboy is the real deal-a wonderfully nostalgic look at a bygone era mixed with a parable about the destructive nature of technology if put in the wrong hands and how it affects the relationship between a son and his father.<br /><br />\\"Re-Voicing Steamboy\\" takes a look at the Hollywood types who voiced the characters for the North American release. Anna Paquin, Alfred Molina and Patrick Stewart talk briefly about the film and their appreciation for Otomo with Stewart speaking the most eloquently about the time period that Steamboy is set in.<br /><br />\\"Interview with Katsuhiro Otomo.\\" he started working on the project ten years ago with actual production on the film itself starting seven years ago. Otomo found that doing a period film was a bigger challenge and more time-consuming than a futuristic one like Akira.<br /><br />\\"Multi-Screen Landscape Study\\" is an interesting featurette on the set design and look of the film but conveyed via three split-screens that show clips from the movie, vintage newsreel footage of London and footage of the film's creators talking about their movie.<br /><br />\\"The Adventure Continues\\" allows you to watch the artwork on display during the end credits sequence without the text obscuring it.<br /><br />\\"Animation Onion Skins\\" allows you to watch several sequences in various stages of development, from rough pencil sketches to computer modeling to the final product. This gives some insight into how much work went into this movie.<br /><br />Finally, there are \\"Production Drawings,\\" a montage of artwork for the film's setting that allows you to marvel once again at the attention to detail.the most eloquently about the time period that Steamboy is set in. <br /> <br />\\"Interview with Katsuhiro Otomo.\\" he started working on the project ten years ago with actual production on the film itself starting seven years ago.

0689835604|5.0|Our grandson was just beginning to learn about his eyes, ears, nose, mouth and Belly Button!  He loves the bright pictures and being able to lift the flaps to find what body part is hiding on the baby behind it.  Definitely recommend this book!
B0007M22TI|5.0|This by far is the most soothing music on the planet. These ladies are the very best and possess the most talented voices in music today. Their performance is just another reason, why I take pride in being Irish. Their contribution to the arts far exceeds anyone's expectations and will for years to come.
0321200683|5.0|Patterns are the single most important construct in programming if your goal is to move beyong just the basics.  The gang-of-four book is oustanding, but it's at the object level, and therefore does not extend beyond a single program.  This book is just as good as the GOF book, but it is enterprise level--not just beyond a single program, but applicable to every program in a massive company.  Definitely worth getting.  And the examples do a great job of showing how the patterns actually apply.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have 3 Coldplay CD and I enjoy all of them but this new one is by far the best!  Each song is excellent and flows into the next song.  I definitely recommend getting the whole album since you will find you enjoy all the songs and they fit together to complete the effect.
B000001DWG|2.0|Hey, I'm sure I probably won't make any friends by placing this review on here, but its the truth. <br /> <br />Okay, I was reading the reviews for this album, and just to refresh my memory of the cd, I listened to the samples. I read one where the person said that Andrew Wood's voice sounded more natural and calm than Eddie Vedder's voice, (Or something to the same effect). I am not much of a Pearl Jam fan, i bought a few of their albums and they are pretty good, but get old really quickly. Andrew Wood's voice sucks bad compared to Vedder's. It sounds too whiney. Everyone considers Andrew Wood to be a great example of grunge. Eddie Vedder's voice which is pretty good I guess is a MUCH better representation of grunge than this disappointing album.  Now, don't get me wrong I'm not some Nirvana fanatic, that won't allow other types of music to infiltrate my brain.  But, I mean come on people, it seems like you just rate this album so high because he is deceased. I recommend Stone Temple Pilots, Silverchair(Frogstomp ONLY), Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam (Ten - Vs.), and Nirvana. Try more easy listening stuff, not the stupid Chris Cornell voice or Andrew Whiney.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|There is something about this voice that just takes you places.. Either you get it or you don't.. I get it.. Not only the words.. but the composition of this album is like flipping tbrough a picture book - full of memories.  So enjoyable to listen too and get taken to my own special place.
B0000047CX|5.0|I first listened to this \\"album\\" in the late 60's.  I loved the easy-going melodies, and found myself humming the tunes to myself. <br /> <br />It's nearly 40 years later, and I'm STILL humming the tunes to myself.  This music is light, happy and fun.  Your heart will be glad and your toe wiggling to the beat, will be happy too! <br /> <br />I recommend this \\"CD\\" to anyone who enjoyed this EXCELLENT music long ago...you will love it just as much now as you did then...and now, it will make you smile.   <br /> <br />
B0000584V3|5.0|I sure hope the guy a few reviews under me is joking around, because otherwise he's making a compleate fool of himself.  Now since this guy listens to more rap then he does metal (he doesnt listen to any real metal bands)I dont even know how he could review this Album fairly.  Blackwater Park is a musical masterpiece and Opeth puts together some of the most beautiful pieces music ever created.  To compare Limp Biskit to Opeth is unfair(for Limp Biskit).  Limp Biskit is more of a joke to the music world then an actual contribution.  Since you like Nu-Metal so much, you shouldnt be listening to Opeth in the first place.  Now im not going to disrespect Rap, but to compare it to a metal band is just plain stupid.  Opeth offers one of their best preformeces on Blackwater Park, combining soft and heavy music once again to create a winning reciepe.  Blackwater Park also has more actual song structure rather then one flowing piece of music heard on their earlier releases.  For true metalheads listen to Opeth, Symphony X, Children Of Bodom (Alexi is a Guitar God), In Flames, Tool, Iced Earth.  PLEASE STAY CLEAR OF!!! Korn, Slipknot, My Chemical Romance, As I Lay Dying, CKY, they cant actually write good music, there just cashing in on troubled youth, and their doing a good job at it.  Dont let them use you like they already are, their brainwashing with their BAD ASS IMAGE instead of providing good music!

B00005JLEX|5.0|These episodes are the begining of the greatest show on the planet. They are indeed Classics. The show follows Jerry Seinfeld the Comedian, George Castanza, Elaine Beniz, and the ever so famous Kozmo Kramer through many odd and exiting adventures about nothing. Even though each episode has the most stupidest conversations and the dumbest storylines you find yourself watching and adoring this show. The show was created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David. It first Aired in 1989 and ended with perhaps the funniest finale in history in 1999.<br /><br />Thank You for reading my Review, I hope it was helpful to you

B0006SSOHC|3.0|Saw is a very disturbing movie. I watched it about 10 minuts ago and I am still shaking. It is about two men trapped together in a room, and the only way to stay alive is to kill the other man. There is a complex story line.<br /><br />This movie is confusing at sometimes but overall it is an okay movie. I personaly would never want to watch it again because it is so weird.<br /><br />Saw is very unique. I have never seen a movie like this anywere before.<br /><br />I dont think you should buy this dvd because I dont think you would watch this movie again.It is one of those movies you would be bored watching twice. I would suggest renting it though because it is worth seeing once.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review, I Hope it was helpful.

B0001611DI|5.0|This is George A. Romero's best film. His original Night of the Living Dead is a fine horror film as well as being a scathing attack on racism. His Martin is wonderfully weird and its protagonist strangely sympathetic. Here, though, he combines all of his talents into a movie that is both a terrific horror film (one of the bloodiest ever created) and that is a senstitive and insightful satire of the budding \\"Me\\" generation that had commandeered the social conscience of the 1960s and turned it into something sick and disgusting. It is fitting that the end of this film has the audience rooting for the angry bikers and mindless zombies over the pathetic and greedy protagonists.<br /><br />Not really a sequel to Romero's 1968 splatter-fest, this is more an extrapolation of the events in the earlier film. For some reason, the dead were returning to life and eating the living, creating a plague of zombies that threatened to take over the world. At the end of the original, it seemed somewhat heartening to see that the forces of humanity had figured out how to destroy the zombies and were on the verge of triumph. This sequel picks up some time later, when the qualified victory has fallen apart. Society is on the verge of collapse, and the government is powerless to fight the throngs of zombies. A television reporter named Francine (Gaylen Ross) and a helicopter pilot named Steven (David Emge), accompanied by two National Guardsmen, Peter and Roger (Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger), flee the destroyed studio and escape to a deserted mega-mall. After gung-ho soldier Reiniger is killed, the three others hole up in the mall, ridding it of zombies and fortifying their new Utopia against the masses. They live a life of luxury, taking what they need from the various stores and confirming suspicions that one could, if necessary, live forever in one of those places.<br /><br />Quickly, though, the structure of the outside society that was collapsing re-establishes itself. Steven and Francine become lovers, then become distant. Peter, a black man, finds himself waiting on the two white people. They all become disgusted by the fact that they have everything they could ever need. Eventually, their upper-class nightmare of plenty is disrupted by a gang of bikers who tear into the mall, letting in the zombies and having a good old time slicing off heads and throwing pies. The protagonists have to flee yet again, and the movie ends on one of the most uninspiring uplifting notes I can remember.<br /><br />There's an obvious class issue here. The staggering zombies (lower classes) are trying to get into the shopping mall, that apex of Western culture, which is defended by the white protagonists (upper classes) and their valet. The rich people are unhappy, because, as we all know (wink wink), money doesn't buy happiness and the lives of the rich aren't as great as one would think. Finally, the bikers (more lower classes) wreck the party by attempting to take part in the riches. Marx would have been proud.<br /><br />The makeup effects were done by the genius Tom Savini, who apparently got a lot of his ideas from the horrors he witnessed in Vietnam. He has a cameo as a biker who is eaten most gruesomely. There's a lot of great sight gags, such as zombie Hare Krishnas and zombie nuns. The film was co-written by the Italian king of horror, Dario Argento, who is strangely incapable of injecting any humor at all into his own films.and Francine become lovers, then become distant. Peter, a black man, finds himself waiting on the two white people. They all become disgusted by the fact that they have everything they could ever need. Eventually, their upper-class nightmare of plenty is disrupted by a gang of bikers who tear into the mall, letting in the zombies and having a good old time slicing off heads and throwing pies. The protagonists have to flee yet again, and the movie ends on one of the most uninspiring uplifting notes I can remember.  <br /> <br />There's an obvious class issue here. The staggering zombies (lower classes) are trying to get into the shopping mall, that apex of Western culture, which is defended by the white protagonists (upper classes) and their valet. The rich people are unhappy, because, as we all know (wink wink), money doesn't buy happiness and the lives of the rich aren't as great as one would think. Finally, the bikers (more lower classes) wreck the party by attempting to take part in the riches. Marx would have been proud.  <br /> <br />The makeup effects were done by the genius Tom Savini, who apparently got a lot of his ideas from the horrors he witnessed in Vietnam. He has a cameo as a biker who is eaten most gruesomely. There's a lot of great sight gags, such as zombie Hare Krishnas and zombie nuns. The film was co-written by the Italian king of horror, Dario Argento, who is strangely incapable of injecting any humor at all into his own films.  <br />

B000002H33|4.0|Before I give my review, I will state I have nothing but respect for Metallica.  Because there is so much good about them its easy to see the few flaws.  Heres my review.    Battery is a great album opener.  The acoustic sounds good but I felt it sounded better in \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" on Ride the Lightening.  After the acoustic, this song just explodes into metal fury.  This song is a head bangers dream.      Master of Puppets in my opinion one of the greatest songs ever composed.  Lyrically and musically, this song screams genius.  There is nothing I'd change about this song.  One of the few songs I consider untouchable.    Thing that should not be- Though the lyrics are pretty haunting in this song, this song just doesn't appeal to me.  The chorus in my opinion is very stale and lacking something powerful.      Sanitarium-  I just didn't buy Hetfields depression in this song.  I didn't feel any true emotion behind it compared to \\"Fade to Black\\" Also there are only 7 notes played throughout the verses making it sound very plain.    Disposable Heroes- This song kicks major ass.  The lyrics are phenominal and the music fits perfectly with it.  Dare I say another perfect head banger?  yes I dare    Leper Messiah- This song kicks ass just not as much as the last track.  Theres just nothing too special about this song, sounds like a typical metal song.  Though I love the guitars in the bridge.  Cliff Burton especially stands out there.    Orion- Compared to Metallica's other instrumentals, this one just doesn't hit me as hard.  I'm not saying its bad, It's just not their best Instrumental.    Garbage Inc.  This is a very fast paced song in which flowed perfectly together to compose one of the greatest thrashers of all time.  I love the solo, Hammets strong point is on this song.    Overall this is still a great album to buy.  I just felt this album didn't have as much emotion as their other album, I felt they were trying too hard to have this album be their defined albums.  I still prefer \\"Ride the Lightning\\" to this
B0002NRQTI|5.0|From the beginning of Animate, you can tell this is not like the past bunch of Rush albums. The first half of the album just rocks, and doesn't let go - Animate, Stick it Out, and Cut to the Chase are among the best songs Rush has done. Nobody's Hero has more of a classic slow Rush feel to it (less of the 90's-grunge sound), but picks up partway through. It's a powerful song. Between Sun & Moon might be the best song on the album. From the opening riff on, it's just a great driving song.  <br /> <br />To be honest, the latter half of the album just doesn't hlod up compared to the first half - Alien Shore is too long, Double Agent is too weird. But I really like Cold Fire (great lyrics), the Speed of Love and Everyday Glory. So what is that in the end, 8 great songs and 2 decent tunes? Sounds like a 5-star album to me. <br /> <br />And even though I like all the classic rush albums (hemispheres, permanent waves, signals, and moving pictures), this is one i always comes back too. perhaps it's because there's more of a raw sound here than on those albums.

B0000CAXID|5.0|Dave Grohl wanted the Foo Fighters debut, which, as every punk and their grandmother can attest, was written and performed almost entirely by Grohl -- Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs contributes a guitar track to \\"X-Static\\" -- to stand on its own merits. When \\"Foo Fighters\\" first debuted, Grohl was quoted as saying, he wanted to do everything possible to distance himself from the success of his former band, to avoid the Foos being viewed as a cash cow Nirvana spin-off as so many other bands from the era were being lambasted. <br /> <br />He probably just didn't expect those merits to win him a Grammy or two and leave him at the virtual top of the modern rock pyramid. And honestly, listening to this record as out-of-context-ly as possible, it's difficult to imagine that the Foo Fighters' sound could mutate into the quintessential \\"modern rock\\" sound at all. <br /> <br />\\"Weenie Beenie\\" and \\"Watershed\\" are acidic bursts of punk charged with theatrical but, befitting the punk style, ultimately simple, guitar flourishes. It's hard to imagine anyone but the most baroquely annoying old farts claiming them to be \\"immature\\" and \\"for teenagers only\\" -- as the old saying goes, if it's too loud, then you're too old. <br /> <br />However, as with any Nirvana record, \\"Foo Fighters\\" possesses an ear for buttery, swirling pop rivaling the best the 1960s had to offer. <br /> <br />Cobain and Grohl always seemed to share a lot of the same ideas about making music. It was the little differences that set them apart. Where Cobain's instantly recognizable, cigarette-choked voice was more akin to biting hot cider, lending a punk edge to pieces like \\"About a Girl,\\" where he was otherwise belting out a decidedly Beatles-esque melody, Grohl's vocals on the poppier Foos songs are warm, syrupy and squeaky clean in the grand tradition of 60's pop. \\"Big Me\\" sounds nearly vintage, and its memorable, self-deprecating video (the Mentos commercial spoof) was a valiant way of saving face and street cred. <br /> <br />Elsewhere lie underground classics like \\"Exhausted,\\" with its comparably lo-fi My Bloody Valentine-esque lake of guitar feedback paving the way for a classic rock/metal bridge part, and the aptly-named \\"Floaty\\" which glides first on a lilting acoustic chord progression and then soars on the same chords distorted. Then there's the amped-up blues of \\"For All The Cows,\\" the \\"silly\\" song Dave always tried to perform for audiences like Howard Stern (who veto'd it in favor of \\"Everlong\\"), the George Harrison tribute \\"Oh, George,\\" the heart-thumping rock 'n' roll of \\"Good Grief\\" ... by the time you're done, you've named every song on the album as a standout. <br /> <br />Put simply, every song here does standout as unique from all the others in every way but one -- they all have the Foo Fighters sonic signature stamped proudly on their foreheads. <br /> <br />This is a classic -- the album I stack each and every successive Foos album up against. Each is good in its own way, but none of them can keep up with \\"Foo Fighters\\" and its rabid, fast-paced diversity of style.

B0009RJECO|5.0|Every now and then, a truly original, groundbreaking band surfaces amid all the bland pop and rock. Montreal's Arcade Fire is one such band. In their glorious full-length debut \\"Funeral,\\" Arcade Fire spins elaborate art-rock full of passion and atmosphere.<br /><br />Rather than trying to hook you the way most songs do, Arcade Fire builds up their songs to a musical (and emotional) crescendo. The album opens on a four-song cycle called \\"Neighborhood,\\" which deal with daydreams, neglect, fighting in a family, and just sitting around waiting for life to happen to you. All four things are pretty clearly considered disastrous -- don't waste time, make life happen!<br /><br />Certainly that get-off-your-bum-and-make-things-happen attitude carries over to the wild \\"Wake Up,\\" a howling anthem with an ever-evolving beat, and the well-named \\"Rebellion,\\" where Win sings, \\"\\"Sleeping is giving in/no matter what the time is/Sleeping is giving in/so lift those heavy eyelids.\\" You'll be emotionally exhausted when it reaches the wrenching finale, \\"In the Back Seat.\\" And it does all this while making you dance too. There are bonus tracks, including a vivid B-side and a live performance, which are the ones that stand up to the original work. The other two just don't quite gel.<br /><br />Most pop or rock songs are focused on \\"He/she left me/cheated on me and I'm miserable\\" or \\"I'm so in love.\\" Don't expect anything so obvious from the Arcade Fire. These are about living life in general, not just one part of it. Why's it called \\"Funeral\\"? Partly the fear of dying without having accomplished something.<br /><br />Musically, it will make your head spin. There's a blend of post-punk, rock, art-rock, pop, folk, classical, and much more -- like a punkier version of Neutral Milk Hotel or Modest Mouse. Woven together are xylophone, shimmering strings, swirling keyboard, piano, violins, and accordians. And they're all set to epic, crashing art-rock and disco rhythms.<br /><br />And Win Butler is about as laid-back as his music. He can belt out tormented vocals like few can, shout, wail, whimper, and just sing. And his wife Regine offers equally angsty backing vocals. Which is a good thing, because it takes good vocals to do justice to brilliant songwriting like \\"The neighbors can dance in the disco police lights.\\"<br /><br />The Arcade Fire's \\"Funeral\\" is certainly a contender for \\"Best of 2004.\\" At the very least, it's a polished and wrenching debut, and likely to get you off your butt and out living life. If joie de vivre had a sound, this is what it would sound like.<br />And Win Butler is about as laid-back as his music.

0451209338|4.0|This book was a wonderful discovery. A touch of Le Carre, an echo of Ludlum, but a lot of something of its own as well. Silva's fourth book, and his first of several set against the backdrop of the Middle East-Palistinian conflict and the holocaust. Silva introduces a fascinitating character in Gabriel Allon, and weaves a wonderful network of intriguing relationships with equally intriguing characters, most notably Ari Shamron and Tariq. Allon, a \\"retired\\" assassin formerly in the employ of Mossad is brought out of retirement when a former arch-rival, in the form of Tariq, is plotting the assassination of a major head of state. The plot is exciting and fast paced, and takes the reader to some fascinating locations. Silva's \\"art restorer\\" background for Allon is a gem. This book gets 4 and 1/2 stars from me! I thoroughly enjoyed it, and wholeheartedly recommend it.

B00082IJ08|5.0|I say that this album is brilliant, plain and simply brilliant...  However, the POP content is very high and if you experience nasty symptoms or side effects than I don't advise that you listen to it.  I hate comparing artists but this album is like The Back Street Boys if they had gotten really doped....  In fact this should show boy bands that this is what their music could of sounded like if they had actually tried.  I think Gorillaz has set an example here and for the first time I like the over saturation of contemporary POP but it is melded perfectly with sinister urges and compulsions...  if pop music had Tourettes, this would be the album to display it.  Very well done guys!

B0001US8EO|5.0|This was by far the best movie Kevin Costner has been in to date, he was born to play to role of Wyatt Earp. The movie started off when Earp was a young boy and shows him growing up and how he grew to be the legendary lawman that we all know of. Aswell it also depicts the Gunfight in the OK carall. This film also shows how Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday met and became friends. Unlike in \\"Tombstone\\" Doc Holliday is shown to be a little more down to earth and serious, played by Dennis Quaid. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good western, or to anyone who loves a good Costner flick.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Dream Theater are in a difficult place: no matter what they do, their many fans will complain. It is true that SDOIT did have some major weaknesses, but Train of Thought was blasted by fans for being too heavy, not having enough keyboards, or wasting James LaBrie. I agree that LaBrie's vocal parts were weak, but as for the other two, it was Dream Theater evolving. Fans just complained about the fact that Petrucci's guitar was dominant and overlooked the fact that it was them at their most consistent and strongest lyrically. They didn't meander off without a direction like they constantly did in \\"Scenes.\\" Unfortunately, Dream Theater listened to those fans and tried to fix everything that those fans have complained about: Petrucci is given no room to work, another 20+ epic was written, plus they tried to make themselves more accessible. Hence tracks 2-4 were penned: 2 being a sappy ballad, 3 seemingly inspired by Coldplay, and 4 sounding like modern U2. Few are the fans that will enjoy these, although now that I think about it, if they had done something more along the lines of \\"War\\"-era U2, the results might have been different; just a thought. <br />Anyway, \\"The Root of All Evil\\" has been trashed by many of the reviews for some reason; I thought it was great. Heavy rhythm guitars and I like the tuning that Rudess used for his solo. Petrucci's solo is short and weak, but they redeem for that with a haunting piano outro (although I admit I have a weakness for piano outro's, some of my favorite songs being DT's \\"In the Name of God,\\" Faith No More's \\"Epic,\\" and Opeth's \\"Leper Affinity\\"). \\"Panic Attack\\" starts out with a complex bass section by Myung, and this would probably be one of my favorite DT songs if Petrucci didn't deliver his weakest solo ever. In \\"Never Enough,\\" Petrucci goes for quality instead of quantity, making his solo one of his best. \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" seems about 2-3 years late, but the instrumental section is great. This is really Petrucci's only extended solo, and he takes full advantage. His riff after the solo is memorable as well. \\"Octavarium\\" is difficult for me to grade, because I have only heard several songs that long. I can't really tell if it's good or not as a whole; there are many slow and boring sections in the song, something that wasn't in \\"A Change of Seasons\\" and Symphony X's \\"Odyssey,\\" which were interesting the entire way through, but then again, those two set the bar pretty high. Throughout the album James LaBrie proves he is not the weak link in the band. His vocal work is his best in ten years at least; especially in \\"The Root of All Evil\\" and \\"Never Enough\\" where his singing is top-notch. <br />Anyway, I wish people would stop comparing this to DT's past albums. It isn't a return to Images & Words, whoever says so is wrong. It is a progression, and while there are some good and even great moments, it is far from their best. Even so, there is enough good stuff to make this a worthwhile purchase.
B00004TX5F|3.0|Something seems strangely amiss with what could have been a fascinating historical glimpse into the world of the castrati (castrated male opera singers) in 18th-century Europe. This 1994 Belgian film is an opulent production full of stunning costumes and set decorations, but director Gerard Corbiau is far more focused on the co-dependency between two real-life brothers, Carlo Broschi, the swoon-worthy castrato known to the world as Farinelli, and his marginally talented composer brother Riccardo. Although there are glimpses of the castration that occurred when Carlo was ten, the narrative deals very little with the psychological anguish of this act, instead showing extravagantly vainglorious scenes of Farinelli's impact on audiences at the time. It's as if the story structure of the Baroque operas written at that time took over the sensibility of the screenplay and trivialized the human complexities into exaggerated melodrama.<br /><br />Despite a valiant effort by Stefano Dionisi in the title role, Farinelli is portrayed as a moody, self-centered egotist rather than a misunderstood artist. Compounding the problem is the fact that his masculine speaking voice is at odds with his ethereal singing voice (obviously a creative decision so as not to alienate the general audience from the character's plight). Moreover, the computerized melding of countertenor Derek Lee Ragin and soprano Ewa Mallas Godlewska into Farinelli's voice simply does not sync up well with Dionisi's lip and throat movements. In other words, you simply don't believe it's Dionisi's voice coming out of him. When the film finally takes flight in the last third of the film, it's because the focus has shifted to the competitive, intense relationship between Farinelli and the great composer of the age, Handel. Jeroen Krabbe - familiar to American audiences for his nasty turn as Barbra Streisand's condescending husband in \\"The Prince of Tides\\" - plays Handel with such passionate fury that I wish the film was more about his character. This sequence climaxes with the film's musical highlight, a trio of wonderful, truly classic arias from Handel's \\"Rinaldo\\" - \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\", \\"Cara sposa, amante cara, dove sei?\\" and \\"Venti, turbini, prestate le vostre ali a questo pie\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, the remaining musical performances are not nearly as absorbing and rather repetitive. The film again flails toward the end when we are given a rather silly scene involving a solar eclipse and gratuitous nudity with a m&eacute;nage a trois among Farinelli, Riccardo and Alexandra, the woman who is - quite literally - between them. The remaining performances are fine with Enrico LoVerso conveying his Salieri-like inferiority with appropriate fervor, Elsa Zylberstein beguiling as Alexandra and Caroline Cellier doing a fine Jeanne Moreau impersonation as the jaded Margareth Hunter. Overall it's still a relatively disappointing movie saved by Handel's musical genius. Except for a few trailers, there are no extras with the DVD. For those interested in the world of the castrati in more penetrating detail, I suggest reading Anne Rice's 1982 novel, \\"Cry to Heaven\\", and the \\"Rinaldo\\" arias are better served by countertenor David Daniels and mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli on their 2002 cast recording conducted by Christopher Hogwood.was more about his character.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|First time I watched it, I was enjoying it as the very funny satire that it seemed to be.  Then, 2/3rds through, it got serious and sad and tragic.  This turn in the story threw me off, and I found myself drawn into a horrific tragedy instead of a comedy.  By the end, any effort to revert back to humor seemed contrived.  It felt like being the butt of an unkind joke, like being served chocolates laced with Ex-lax.<br /><br />Upon watching it again, and knowing what was ahead, I didn't get sucked into the plot so much, and instead just enjoyed the silly scenes for what they are.  For the most part, this is a genuinely affectionate homage to the zombie genre.

B000002BFZ|5.0|I've had this album since it first came out. I don't know why it's taken me this long to write a review for this album. Pearl Jam is close to my heart. I have been a fan of this band since they first started back in the early 90s. I have bought just about every album but slacked off for the past 3 years now. The music just didn't touch me anymore. <br /> <br />To get back to the point at hand, I'm ready to write the review. It won't be too great but it will be honest. This album is beautiful. Every song has it's own personality and it's own special purpose. If you are looking to dive right into the heart of grunge jams and hard rock sessions this album is for you. Eddie's voice is like smooth silk tumbled over with a sometimes distorted slurring or weird pronunciation of words. Yes, Eddie can be hard to understand sometimes. Good luck trying to figure out what he says on the song, \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" which isn't on this album but was a song notorious for confusing listeners yet it sounds fantastic if you don't mind not completely understanding. <br /> <br />My favorite songs off of this album are: \\"In My Tree\\" it's harmonious, heartfelt, and worthy of listening to several times; \\"Around the Bend\\" it's reminiscent of the last song on the Ten album \\"Release Me\\", Eddie displays his low baritone on at least one song per album; \\"Smile\\" is funny and sarcasm at it's best, Eddie really needs to quelch some of the deranged happiness and questionable anger on this song, just keep listening to it and you'll see what I mean; \\"Red Mosquito\\" about a bothersome creature that really screws some mess up on Eddie. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great album. It's not for just any rock fans. It's for people who either grew up during the grunge movement and loved the music then or feel like life sucks sometimes even if you have love. Pearl Jam is a band I'll love and remember for a lifetime. Rock on, Eddie!!!!!!

B0007Y08IS|5.0|Whoever you are and wherever you stand in the war on terrorism, you should laugh at this movie.  If you can't, have your sense of humor checked.  The fact that the actors are puppets makes it possible to laugh.  Real actors would make it uncomfortable and stupid. <br /> <br />Most everything concerning the war on terror is ridiculed:  terrorists, the military, war protestors, intelligence, WMD.  Private contractors and the president are spared.  The humor works because the movie takes everything to a ridiculous extreme.  Team America destroys the cultural icons of every country they enter.  War protestors are traitors actively involved with terrorists.  The music is over the top as is the sex. <br /> <br />The world has become a scary place.

B00003CXCT|3.0|Ok, I bought this set well-knowing that it was the special edition and had changes. This has nothing to do with my review.    First of all, the sound is absolutely incredible. I have many digital versions of Star Wars, and this one blows them all away. I couldn't be any happier in that category.     My only problem is that the video is way, WAY too clear. Why is this a problem, do you ask? Because it makes the models used in the film actually LOOK like models, not the real thing. The Death Star looks like a plastic toy, as do the X-wings, AT-ATs, Y-wings, and all other models used to make the films. Everything has a sterile, 'plastic' look to it.    The original films had a slightly 'grainy' look to them which GREATLY added to the realism. This may not have been originally intended, but it gave the trilogy a terrific 'period' feel. This DVD release looks like a huge cartoon with toy ships flying around. In my opinion, it's absolutely horrible and is nothing like it used to be: nothing like we remembered while growing up. It's like a box of candy with too much sugar.    So, if you want to get that nostalgic feeling you had while first watching these films, watch the laserdisc or VHS versions, because this one is NOT Star Wars to me. It's a shiny new penny that was mistakenly dropped in a 30 year old well. You may not understand this review as of now, but when you see this set you'll definitely know what I'm talking about.
B00000I8UK|5.0|Ah, the places Dolphy could have gone had he lived longer.  As it was, he would die later in the year of a diabetic condition, and Out to Lunch would remain his last masterpiece (to some his only, but to me one of many.)  This is his most iconic recording, his grandest vision, and shows the places he would have gone.   <br /> <br />First of all is the concept.  Eric Dolphy was an avant-gardist of the highest degree, a musician of the same scope as a John Coltrane, an Ornette Coleman, an Albert Ayler, a Cecil Taylor.  What ultimately set him apart from these other revolutionaries, though, was his view of freedom WITHIN form, within meter (or a least pulse) within tonality, whilst his colleagues were often disgarding these conventions.  But Dolphy, rather than throwing down barriers, would push them, constantly straining to see how far they could go, while always leaving a foot, or at least a toe, in the tradition.  Why is this such a great approach?  Because it makes his music so eminently approachable!  Dolphy doesn't leap ahead, so eager to explore that he leaves his comrades, or his fans behind.  He revolutionizes the music in small, methodical steps, allowing us all to follow his progress, and remain right next to him the entire time.  Out to Lunch is the culmination of this.  Dolphy doesn't limit himself rhythmically or harmonically, experimenting with both to the utmost.  But he relies on witty, catchy compositions, and a pulse so steady it would straighten the leaning tower of Pisa, to propel his explorations.   <br /> <br />Of course in this he was helped by a world-class band.  The most crucial sideman is undoubtedly Tony Williams, responsible for that afore-mentioned pulse.  But he doesn't just keep time...or pulse, but almost provides sonorities with his drums, using it almost as an array of orchestral percussion equipment, to spur on, and interact with, the soloists.  Everyone reading this knows he is brilliant, knows how young he was...I'd have to say this might be his finest moment.  Also check out his own Lifetime for drumming very close to that of here.   <br /> <br />Also was Richard Davis, a name not mentioned much in the history BOOKS, but absolutely critical in the actual history.  He sounds particularly good on this record, due to a very fine engineering job by Van Gelder...his bass is more visible then ever, and, as you will hear, plays a really important role in the sound of the album, varying up the rhythms, using plenty of double-stops and wide intervals.  This has some of the best mixing for a bass player I've ever heard.  His work on Hat and Beard, with a brilliant improvised bass vamp, and on Sweet/Tender is particularly noteworthy.   <br /> <br />Hutcherson has the piano role on the vibes, but he doesn't function like a piano player...he never does.  He doesn't play vibes like a Milt Jackson, but more as a percussive instrument, getting a really ringing sound...creating layers of sound under the soloing rather than throw-away chords, which just wouldn't do on an album like this.  His solos are also more subtle than Dolphy or Hubbard, more impressionistic.     <br /> <br />Then there's Hubbard, the perfect trumpeter for this kind of thing (although one wonders what Booker Little would have sounded like!)  His solos, not as exotic or esoteric as Dolphy's, are nevertheless the perfect complement.  His improvisation is equal to that of the leader's on a technical level, his tone is burnished, even lovely, and he fits right in, proving he's not JUST a hard bop groovemaker like some foolish critics seem to think.  He was also on Free Jazz, Ascension, and Dialogue, after all.  What's interesting about his playing here is it's a bit more contained; his tone, rather than the normal fire-spewing, is more concentrated, like, as another reviewer said, a bumblebee.  You'll understand when you hear.  An interesting contrast to his other work.   <br /> <br />And Dolphy, is, of course, a literal genius.  With lessof an allegiance to bebop than ever, his work here (on alto) contains the next logical step from his magnificent five-spot recordings (which everyone should own.)  His flute gets a one-track showing, but his bass clarinet may be the most famous thing...his growls and snarls on Hat and Beard and his interplay with Davis on Something Sweet, Something Tender make up the most radical core of Out to Lunch.  But on whatever instrument, he is probing, testing, pushing walls, bending rules, stretching borders, playing both inside and outside the rest of the band both rhythmically (Hat and Beard) and harmonically (the title-track and the ending blues.)   <br /> <br />This really is not only one of the greatest avant-garde recordings ever, but one of the greatest jazz albums in general, and it NEEDS to be in your collection.  And I all but guarantee: listening to this a few times will give you a real good headstart in not only understanding, but liking, the free jazz that was to come.  The magnum opus of a true genius of jazz, who could have gone so, so many places.
B0000009RX|4.0|You had to be there, man!  When this album was released (eons ago in the stone(d) age), it was a metaphor for a freak's life and if you can't dig what I'm saying.. read no further.  Yes.. I agree that the sound quality isn't up to par but, really, it NEVER was!  It is what it is and what it is... is groundbreaking considering its' vintage and political significance to the 60's.  Sure, there are many of Zappa's projects that are far superior in terms of production quality, many that contain more of Zappa's trademark controversional  lyrics (for the &quot;fans&quot; that like to tap their feet to his lyrical vulgarity) but, when it comes to this particular project, its' vibe and its' contribution to the 1960's and early progressive rock orchestrations (not to mention the groovy album cover artwork) well... I'm just glad that this album is still available!<br />It IS sad that the production quality suffers as it does but we always have great albums with amazing production (for their time) such as Blodwyn Pig's &quot;Ahead Rings Out&quot; and Led Zepplin 1 available on CD these days.  Try and get &quot;past&quot; the weak production quality and enjoy the amazing arrangements, humour and everything else that is vintage Zappa!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was mesmerized on my first viewing of this film, having never seen anything like it.  The choice of modern songs blew me away.  For years, film-makers have been searching for a way to use music to tell stories without jumping into an un-real world of singing and dancing in inappropriate, un-real scenarios.  This film is an exercise in that quest.  The classic device of using a play within a play is brilliantly used, again drawing attention to the real/unreal quality of musicals.  The extra features are expansive, and can really expand ones understanding of the theme of this film.
1573223026|4.0|The character development was interesting, and the way the story was told from various perspectives drew me in. However, toward the end what had been an interesting and clever premise in the beginning was becoming stretched thinner and thinner. The novel doesn't so much end as much as it simply stops.
B000002UB3|5.0|For those of us who grew up listening to the Beatles, Abby Road is, for me, some of their most fondly remembered music. It is at the same time a sampling of some of the variety of styles represented by their music while being some of the most fun and \\"singable\\" songs that they created. From introspective to whimsical, the songs of Abby Road are well recorded and deliver a \\"close and casual\\" feeling that is a rare combination of studio quality and \\"live\\" spontaneity. I heartily recommend this CD to anyone interested in the Beatles. It is important to note that none of the Beatles music is available online (legally) from iTunes or the other music download services. So... buy the CD.
0060536977|3.0|First, Prey - great story - very engaging, thrilling.  Mr. Crichton is truly a master of suspenseful story-telling.  I found myself sitting in the car after arriving at a destination to continue listening to the CDs.  The characters are well-formed - at first some seemed a bit odd and inconsistent, but that is explained by the end.  The whole book occurs in a week -most of it in 2 days, so there is a lot of suspense and excitement packed in.  Overall, I'd recommend the book/audio book. <br /> <br />However, WHAT is up with Michael Crichton and the lectures?  I'm in the process of listening/reading the books I haven't already read.  I read State of Fear recently and felt like I was being beat over the head with envirnomental politics.  There was certainly less of that in Prey, but certainly the overall message was one of research ethics (or lack thereof) and the book ends with more of a lecture.  I just don't find that enjoyable, and I'm hesitant to read any new books he comes out with since there seems to be a trend toward this.  I understand, Mr. Crichton's books have always had a \\"when research goes bad\\" theme, but when reading fiction I don't want to be berated with the author's political/environmental/ethical viewpoints as much as Mr. Crichton has been doing recently.
006441034X|5.0|This is a wonderful story. It's good for all ages. She really has a good grasp of the workings of her worlds. Her characters have faults and good points and have a sense of being real that many characters from books lack. My only complaint was that it felt too short.
B00000ING2|5.0|(...) The Hudsucker Proxy is not a children's movie.  Although some children, and particularly adults who are 'young at heart' will appreciate the antics of the title character (played superbly by Tim Robbins), the film is really for those who are fans of first-rate, rapid-fire dialogue, and sublte (often mislabelled as 'quirky') humor. OR fans of the Coen Brothers, OR of Tim Robbins.  All are in their prime here.    (...), the true greatness of this movie is revealed in the fact that, while the story is engaging, and the portrayals are all spot-on for a comedic take on a story of innocence and corruption (not to mention it has Paul Newman), like Monty Python's work, there's a gem to be uncoverred in almost every single line of dialogue.  Consequently, it just gets better and better with repeated viewings, and fans of quoting movies will have a treasure trove of useful one-liners on their hands.    My favorite scene? It's got to be the two over-worked, lunchbreak New York cabbies who narrate, in their own unique way, the scam-in-progress first meeting between our two main characters, seated across a diner from them, beginning with the line:   \\"Enter the Dame.  There's one in every story...\\"  I've used that one many times myself.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausicaa of the valley of the wind is a simply beautiful anime.the story is great for all ages and the characters are all loveable in their own ways.Hayao Miyazaki in my opinion is one of if not the best directors in anime history.i highly recommend this movie to everyone
B00025ETIW|5.0|This is the nost original album of this era. Rock n' roll is not dead yet, but it is well on the way... My Chemical Romance may just be that auxillary generator that will keep the life support on!
B00008OLYN|5.0|This album is truly very good, regardless of whatever genre it gets labeled as.  The distortion, rolling double bass and growling vocals customary of other Opeth offerings are not present; they're also not needed. <br /> <br />This album is able to pack quite an emotional punch without any sort of abortive gesture because the carefully-crafted musical statement is superbly written and well-executed. <br /> <br />It gets better every time I listen to it, and it the tunes are so memorable that it's hard to get them out of your head.  (Fortunately, you won't want to.)  Best album I've bought in a long time!
B0009MDPYM|5.0|Truly scary and diabolical, full of Catholic theological twists, and with a great Tilda Swinton as the angel Gabriel.  Keanu Reeves plays a much darker character than any I've seen him do before, like an updated Humphrey Bogart, and his darkness actually makes you forget how cute he is, not an easy thing to do.  Lucifer's evil is convincingly subtle, and the conclusion is great, not forced and definitely not a letdown.  Worth watching.
B00006BTCA|5.0|oh, interpol how do i love thee.i have'nt stopped listening to these guys or this cd for 3 years and counting. i am an unabashed interpol fan, so this review is very biased. turn on the bright lights is an excellent albumn from begining to end. some songs are definently catchier than others,but none the less brilliant.hands away is hands down my personal fav.untitled is short,but quite lovely(i could listen to it for hours).roland awesome on the cd even better live.i'm quite fond of leif erickson(an excellent remix on the evil single,by the way).i highly recommed turn on the bright lights(obviously)and everything else from interpol,and if you have'nt already, see these guys live. interpol shows are very addictive.
B0007YVBFC|5.0|Mariah Carey never ceases to amaze me!! Charmbracelet may not have been her best album vocally but what amazed me by that album was that it didn't sound like any other of her other albums and it was like that \\"My Saving Grace\\" song was made for me because since I am a Christian, I feel exactly the same, Lord Jesus is my saving grace. After just one listen to The Emancipation Of Mimi, it amazes me how Mariah is not afraid to take chances, she doesn't have to have every single album sound exactly alike, she does what she wants and doesn't let anyone tell her what to do. NO album is exactly alike. There's always progression. I am, always have been, and always will be Mariah's true and hugest fan!! It's like Mariah writes these songs for me, I mean that I can totally relate, I'm a girl so it's not literally for me but hopefully people will know what I mean!!! I totally love The Emancipation Of Mimi which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 charts and spawned Mariah's 16th #1! As I am writing this review I have now listened to it over 200 times since it came out and this CD has NEVER once left my home CD player or car CD player!!!  That's gotta tell you something!!!!<br /><br />The song It's Like That is so awesome to dance and sing along to. I love the music, the lyrics, and especially Mariah's powerful vocals! My all time favorite song is really hard to pick because there are two songs that I love and really can't decide between the two. We Belong Together is such a wonderful, beautiful slow ballad that reached number 1 on Billboard, Mariah's 16th #1, it's so powerful musically, vocally and lyrically and Mariah's voice is so amazing and everyone who thinks Mariah can't sing anymore, don't know what they're talking about because Mariah's voice is so incredible, especially on the end of this song!!! I totally love it!!!! The song Fly Like A Bird is such a spiritually, powerful song and it's amazing that Mariah wrote these words that I've been wanting to say, well I've been searching for the right words and it's Mariah who knew exactly what I was feeling toward the Lord. Mariah's church Minister or Pastor speaks throughout the song and \\"His Love Will Never Forsake You Or Leave You Alone, Trust Him\\" is forever in my soul. Words like \\"Carry Me Home, Higher Jesus, Carry Me Higher Lord\\" and \\"I Need You Now Lord, Carry Me High, I Need The Strength Of You By My Side\\" and \\"Keep Your Head To The Sky, With God's Love You'll Survive.\\" There is also a Choir singing. This song tells exactly how I feel toward the Lord Jesus and what I want to say to him. There's nothing better than my favorite singer of all time singing about my saviour, Lord Jesus!!! Another favorite of mine is Joy Ride. Not because my name is in the title, because it's such a cool pop song that you can sing along to and Mariah's vocals are over the top, especially at the very end of the song with Mariah doing that really high note and that long note she holds at the end, it's incredible!!!!! I love the music during the chorus of Joy Ride with drum and bass beats, it's awesome!!! Shake It Off is a really cool R&B upbeat song. Mine Again is another slow ballad that Mariah belts on. Mariah just about belts on every single song, especially on We Belong Together, Mine Again, Joy Ride, and Fly Like A Bird. Say Somethin' with Snoop Dogg is a really cool dance R&B song with a really cool beat to dance to and I find myself singing along to this song too. Stay The Night is a very soulful and unique song, the music reminds me of something from the 50's or 60's and I love the way Mariah sings and belts. I love It!! Get Your Number with Jermaine Dupri is a cool upbeat R&B song that I also like. One And Only with Twista is a cool mid-tempo song that I like a lot. Circles is another slow ballad that I love and love the way Mariah sings!! Your Girl is a really cool upbeat song and I love the way Mariah sings in the chorus, it's a really cool song to sing along to!!! In I Wish You Knew, Mariah speaks a few times during the song and you hear an audience, a very beautiful slow ballad, I especially love the end when Mariah hits that high note!!! To The Floor with Nelly could be the next club song, it's a really cool upbeat R&B/Hip-Hop song.<br /><br />When I hear the song Fly Like A Bird, I picture just soaring way up high in the clouds because the song just makes me think of being up there in the clouds, being free, and on Joy Ride, I picture being up in the stars because the whole song makes me picture being up there high and flying through the stars. If Mariah was to make a music video for Fly Like A Bird, I picture her just soaring through the clouds on an Eagles' wing or something and for Joy Ride, I picture Mariah soaring through the stars. Mariah sings with so much emotion, soul, and power on these songs, all 14 of them, using all 7 of her octaves, hitting that really high note a lot!!! There is all sorts of elements, Pop, Hip-Hop, Soul, Gospel, and R&B. I have noticed that a lot of people are stating that Mariah is in her 40's or 50's and that is NOT TRUE!! Mariah was born in 1970 so she's only 35! And I also noticed people are just assuming that every other track has a hip-hop collaboration. NOT TRUE!! Out of 14 tracks, only 4 of them have some kind of collaboration which means 10 of them are JUST MARIAH!!! And if you get the U.K. version, 11 are JUST MARIAH with Sprung. Sprung is a bonus track that sounds very unique.  It doesn't sound like any other song Mariah has ever done and highly recommend you getting this for Sprung!  Mariah's new CD, The Emancipation Of Mimi is a MUST HAVE for anyone who likes any of those elements I listed above and especially Mariah fans!! Mariah is the BEST!!!eaks a few times during the song and you hear an audience, a very beautiful slow ballad, I especially love the end when Mariah hits that high note!!!

B00005N5S5|5.0|great sci fi , for those who complain about sound and picture , well this was 1984 , how could any  one complain about a person who became a superstar for speaking only something like 35 words in the hole picture. I'll be back , you bet i will!!!!
0441003257|5.0|Who would have thought it, Neil Gaiman, the dark lord of literature himself, and Terry Pratchett, the king of footnotes, teaming together to write a novel about the apocalypse? Good Omens is, put simply, the best book I have ever read. I have never had so much fun with a piece of literature. Pratchett seems to do most of the writing, but Gaiman has a huge foothold in the plot and the more satirical areas of the book. With all this hysteria today about pollution and the Earth crashing into the sun, it's refreshing to get a novel that turns it all on its ear. Good Omens is hysterical, well-written, engaging and just all-around brilliant. I recommend it to anyone who knows anything about religion.
0783219695|5.0|I remember when Apollo 13 was still in the theatres, audiences actually gave it standiung ovations. It has not lost its capacity to awe and excite ten years later. Ron Howard and Tom Hanks and all the rest of the cast and crew have evoked an epic period in exploration, when people actually got bored with the idea of men walking on the Moon. And then, one day, fate taught us all the perils of space exploration.<br /><br />Truly the best film of the 1990s.<br /><br />--Mark R. Whittington (...)
B00004Y6O9|1.0|David Lee Roth ruined this whole album.  I loved Eddie's guitar playing, but I just can't listen to this because of Roth horrible voice. The only songs I find remotelly listenable are Runnin With the Devil and Eruption every other song, nomatter how good Eddie is, sounds like crap thanks to Roth. DO NOT BUY, unless you want to listen to the most annoying singer of all time
B00062IDCO|4.0|Nominated for 30 Emmys, including seven for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series, Star Trek: Voyager continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its fan base. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. The third spin-off from the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager premiered in January 1995 to modest critical acclaim, but experienced great success with television viewers, slowly increasing its ratings as the series progressed. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), the series precedes Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) while boasting an all-star cast that includes veteran actress Kate Mulgrew (whose past TV appearances include such shows as Dallas, Cheers, and Murphy Brown). Yet instead of pursuing the classic Star Trek mission to \\"boldly go where no one has gone before,\\" Star Trek: Voyager is more about going where the crew has been before... <br /> <br />Star Trek: Voyager follows the exploits of the crew aboard the starship USS Voyager. As the series begins, the Voyager is on a Federation mission to capture a rogue ship of Maquis rebels (a race first introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). While in pursuit of the Maquis, the Voyager enters a system known as the badlands, and both ships are instantaneously transported to the Delta Quadrant over seventy-thousand light years away on the outskirts of the galaxy. Soon, both the Maquis and the crew of Voyager learn they were brought to Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, a mysterious force overseeing the safety of the Ocampan race who live inthe shadow on an impending threat from the vicious Kazon. When the Kazon destroy the Maquis ship, the Voyager crew merges with the Maquis crew to defend themselves from the Kazon. Having destroyed the device which could bring them home, the crew of the Voyager - led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), and the crew of the Maquis ship - led by Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), must work as a united front in order to meet their mutual goal of finding a way home... <br /> <br />The Star Trek: Voyager (Season 7) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere \\"Unimatrix Zero\\" in which Seven Of Nine discovers a place known as Unimatrix Zero, where Borg drones become individuals for a short period during their regeneration. However, once the regeneration process is complete, the drones forget all memory of the event. Capt. Janeway views this revelation as an opportunity to attack the Borg, and the Voyager must execute the plan perfectly if it is to succeed... Other notable episodes from Season 7 include \\"Nightingale\\" in which Harry Kim, Seven Of Nine, and Neelix stumble across a war between two alien nations while scavenging for dilithium, and \\"Friendship One\\" in which, having established regular contact with Alpha Quadrant, the Voyager receives orders from Starfleet to hunt down the lost 21st Century Earth probe, Friendship One... <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes included on the Star Trek: Voyager (Season 7) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 147 (Unimatrix Zero: Part 2)  <br />Episode 148 (Imperfection)  <br />Episode 149 (Drive)  <br />Episode 150 (Repression)  <br />Episode 151 (Critical Care)  <br />Episode 152 (Inside Man)  <br />Episode 153 (Body and Soul)  <br />Episode 154 (Nightingale)  <br />Episode 155 (Flesh and Blood: Part 1)  <br />Episode 156 (Flesh and Blood: Part 2)  <br />Episode 157 (Shattered)  <br />Episode 158 (Lineage)  <br />Episode 159 (Repentance) <br />Episode 160 (Prophecy)  <br />Episode 161 (The Void)  <br />Episode 162 (Workforce: Part 1)  <br />Episode 163 (Workforce: Part 2)  <br />Episode 164 (Human Error)  <br />Episode 165 (Q2)  <br />Episode 166 (Author, Author) <br />Episode 167 (Friendship One) <br />Episode 168 (Natural Law) <br />Episode 169 (Homestead) <br />Episode 170 (Renaissance Man) <br />Episode 171 (Endgame: Part 1) <br />Episode 172 (Endgame: Part 2)  <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B000805796|5.0|Melanie C's musical style has been beautifully captured on this cd. Every time she puts out an album, she puts it WAY out. She's always doing something a little different, yet familiar in that Melanie way. \\"Sporty Spice who?\\" is what I now say to those who ask if she was a Spice Girl. Yes she was, but she isn't a Spice Girl anymore, and nothing about her or her music would indicate that. Her music is refreshing and wild, yet calm and beautiful. Her music is 100% Melanie Chisholm. <br /> <br />1. Beautiful Intentions. A great start to the cd, bringing in a mid-tempo rocker. <br /> <br />2. Next Best Superstar. This song was a little out of context for this album, but never the less, a great first single which is sung beautifully.  <br /> <br />3. Better Alone. Melanie states clearly that she doesn't need a man to be happy. She's fine with herself. And for those that know her well, would know she values her music more than anything in life. <br /> <br />4. Last Night on Earth. With a hint of being a pop song, it slaps you into realization that it is pure rock.  <br /> <br />5. You will see. One of the better songs on the cd. Trust me, you will see. <br /> <br />6. Never Say Never. this song has good music, and I love the chorus. One of my favs. <br /> <br />7. Good Girl. Another beautiful song. <br /> <br />8. Don't need this. Another personal fav. This song is fun to listen to.  <br /> <br />9. Little piece of me. Not a personal fav but a great song still. <br /> <br />10. Here and now. Another non-fav, but good. <br /> <br />11. Take Your Pleasure. Can you say \\"Best song ever made by melanie\\"?. This is her feistiest song and has great attitude in it.  <br /> <br />12. You'll get yours. Second best song on this cd.  <br /> <br />Overall, this cd is worth more than it costs. It's countless replay value alone is worth the money. The songwriting, vocals, instruments, everything is perfect. Melanie will be around for many more albums, which i'm sure will only get better.
1573223026|4.0|Reading the book's jacket on what the book was about I had second thoughts before turning the page to begin my read. True, the subject matter is about four people about to kill themsleves, but Nick Hornby still makes the subject lighthearted. The story begins with four people from very different backgrounds who use New Year's Eve, not as a time to make for resolutions for the coming year, but instead to resolve to end their lives by jumping off a building. Coming together at such a low point in their lives unites the foursome, which includes a down on his luck talk show host, an older woman caring for a disabled son, a teen girl who can't handle her first breakup, and an American guy in his 20s whose band broke up and girlfriend dumped him. As an English writer, Nick Hornby uses the American to show some of the cultural differences in language, which I found hilarious. Anyway, although they don't always get along, the group gives each other support, simply by sharing the same depressing feeling that there is nothing more to live for.  <br /> <br />The book is told through each charachter, so it is interesting to read each other's viewpoints as the story progresses. Jumping back and forth among characters could easily become annoying or confusing but the author is skillful in his technique. While suicide is certainly not to be taken lightly, as the book does have its deeper moments, the interplay amongst the characters is very entertaining and I'm sure this book will soon be a movie, in which case, I'll be there.

Sporting an entirely new cast and crew from its two predecessors, the show focuses on a particular system administered by the Federation instead of the usual Star Trek mission of \\"exploring strange new worlds\\"... <br /> <br />Star Trek: Deep Space Nine follows the exploits of the Starfleet crew aboard an abandoned and gutted Cardassian space station orbiting the planet of Bajor. In the aftermath of Cardassian occupation, the Bajorian government invited the Starfleet to oversee the reconstruction of the space station. Deep Space Nine quickly transformed into a teeming city of commerce and a hub for travel (similar to Babylon 5) thanks to the discovery of an unknown wormhole nearby. But the wormhole leads to the Gamma Quadrant, realm of the feared Dominion alliance, which views the wormhole travelers as a threat to its totalitarian grip on power. As such, the Dominion launches an attack against the Federation and its Klingon allies. The subsequent and ongoing war is the basis for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine... <br /> <br />Capt. Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) is credited with discovering the wormhole, and he oversees the crew of Deep Space Nine as they wage battle to preserve the Federation. Ironically, his colleague, Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois), is a Changeling - an alien race of \\"shapeshifters\\" who lead the Dominion's united front.

B0000ACY0Y|4.0|Some of us followed the heady days of the Byrds for the splendours of Gene Clark's writing and singing. Possessed of one of the era's truly great country rock voices, (Steve Young is his direct male equivalent)when Clark soared, we flew with him. As a Byrd apart, the stellar career one might have assumed would follow, was thwarted by mis-timing and mixed managerial direction from his musical marketeers.'White Light' is graced with many fine tunes, but its melancholy shifting melodies failed to break the charts.'No Other' found Clark, the cosmic cowboy, in full career. Production by Thomas Jefferson Kaye (he of the eccentric and affable,'First Grade', which I doubt ever made it to CD format) was a pulling-out of all stops. Appalling lack of support again dogged this often brilliant album. I'm thankful 'Collector's Choice' sought to reissue it.'Life's Greatest Fool','Silver Phial', and'Lady of the North' don't extend him. But in each of the remaining five songs, Clark's crooning is simply the best of his career. Russ Kunkle sits in for most of the drumming. Craig Doerge does some keyboard tinkling. Chris Hillman some mandolin. Jesse Ed Davis and Danny Kooch share guitar credits. Such were Clark's magnetic credentials. Some think 'No Other' is Baroquely excessive. Others, that the very mouthing of such loaded words as'magic','cosmic' and their ilk is wishy washy and bombastic. Perhaps I'd conceed this. But,strangely, they don't date the work or in any way diminsh Clark's conviction which I still find transporting.
0694003611|5.0|I am actually surprised that my son loves this book so much.  I bought it because it is one of \\"the classics\\" and a must have for every young child's collection.  But I figured that the black and white alternate pages and the old style pictures wouldn't interest him after all of his new fancy brightly coloured books.  I am happy to report that I couldn't have been more wrong.  He LOVES this book.  It is an every day read and upon reaching the end, is usually requested again.  He is 17 months old at present and hasn't even begun to tire of Goodnight Moon.  I highly recommend this book for the little set.  There's just something about it that captures their imagination.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|There's a lot of things-great things-that you'll think of when you check out 'Mighty Rearranger'.: <br />1.)This album may very well be his most accomplished,diverse,passionate,way-cool,graceful,inspired,fun and cohesive album he's ever done as a solo artist. True,he's also been responsible for other great solo albums ('93's 'Fate Of Nations','88's 'Now & Zen' and '83's 'The Principle Of Moments' spring immediately to mind (at least they do for me).. But he's never sounded so at home,so at ease and -yet- so invigorated as he does with his great new band,The Strange Sensation. <br />2.)'Mighty Rearranger' also shows you that he's actually better off NOT working with Jimmy Page anymore.. He sounded a bit inhibited here and there in particular on their last album together,1998's 'Walking Into Clarksdale'. Robert has managed to accomplish the near-impossible: surviving and -furthermore- thriving post-Led Zeppelin. He neither denies nor flaunts his past with Led Zep. He simply is looking ahead and doing what he likes. Heck,if that's what it takes and what it's about for him to create such a fabulous album as 'Mighty Rearranger',then so be it! Stay solo,my man.  <br />3.)He somehow manages to incorporate-fluidly,mind you-such an array of styles such as blues,trip-hop,rockabilly,rock and roll,middle-Eastern,folk,r & b and lord knows what else and this enthusiasm for these types of music practically jump out at you from your speakers,or headphones. More often than not,these styles interchange within the perimeters of a single song. Songs that spring to mind that bear this imprint are \\"Another Tribe\\"(the album's strident,almost-unassuming album opener),the first single \\"Shine It All Around\\"(which is reprised as a hidden track and as a rave-like,pumping yet hypnotic number) after the inexplicably-great album closer,the barroom-like raver (and loose tribute to the late,great Ray Charles) \\"Brother Ray\\",\\"Let The Four Winds Blow\\" and the title track are fresh,affectionate nods to his rockabilly roots,and the sheer,tears-well-up-in-the-eyes beauty of the folk luster of \\"All The Kings Horses\\" and \\"Dancing In Heaven\\"...,as well as the brilliant middle-Eastern-ish songs such as \\"Freedom Fries\\",\\"Takamba\\" and my favorite track,the song \\"The Enchanter\\"; which features a guitar line so sinewy and seductive that you can practically envision a cobra slinking out of a wicker basket as you listen to it... Going from that and then segueing into a rave-like coda towards the end. How inspired,man... \\"The Enchanter\\" and the amazing \\"Somebody Knocking\\",which epitomizes his usage of middle-Eastern modes and instruments to the fore... You need to hear it to believe it. Last but not least his most \\"Zep\\"-like number,the song \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" <br />,which boasts a chorus that wouldn't at all sound out of place on Zep's 'Physical Graffiti'. <br />4.)Robert's vocals are spectacular. Rather than straining the range he has to work with nowadays,he wraps his voice in and around the songs; ranging from anything from a hypnotic-near whisper on,say,\\"Shine It All Around\\",\\"Tin Pan Valley\\",\\"All The Kings Horses\\",\\"The Enchanter\\" and \\"Somebody Knocking\\" through to going all-out on \\"Tin Pan Valley\\",\\"Freedom Fries\\",\\"Mighty Rearranger\\".... What else can I say? This album blows me away. I'm so proud of him for sticking to his guns and carrying on post-Led Zeppelin and post-Jimmy Page. He's much better off where he is now so be it this is the barometer of what we get by proxy.. <br />5.)The Strange Sensation is a Real Band. With Robert a Part of The Band,not just a frontman and a name. The sense of being a band is what binds this album together. It's just awesome to see someone as legendary as Robert maintaining both an enthusiasm and a humility for music in general. This band is at once tight,fluid,loose,intricate and yet spare at the same time. 'Mighty Rearranger' is by far one of my proudest newly-released purchases of 2005,if not the last two or three years. <br />The Strange Sensation (Robert on vocals and harmonica,John Baggott on keyboards,electronica and Moog bass,Clive Deamer (late of the also-great Portishead) on drums and bendir,Justin Adams on guitar,bendir,tehardant,lap steel guitar and bass,Skin Tyson on acoustic and electric guitars,lap steel guitar and bass and Billy Fuller on electric and double bass) is a marvel as a band. To sound this accomplished and tight only having been together the last three or so years says it all. <br /> <br />But moreover,'Mighty Rearranger' is a brilliant album,I lie to you not. I say that with understatement and with all due respect,may I add. <br /> <br />Thank God I heard (and saw) the brief commercial for 'Mighty Rearranger' (with a snippet of \\"Shine It All Around\\" playing). I Knew this album was going to special,and yet I didn't know how cool it was until I heard it. <br /> <br />Anyone who truly enjoys such a hybrid of styles and influences in their music-man,you don't know what you're in for (or maybe you are,seeing how you humored my lengthy bits with all of this waxing enthusiastic about 'Mighty Rearranger'!) <br /> <br />Do yourself a solid favor and get 'Mighty Rearranger' pronto. <br />You'll be glad you did and then some. <br /> <br />Thank you for your time. <br /> <br />Tim G. <br />New York <br />
B000002HMH|2.0|I am a hardcore MetallicA fan and i can tell you that this is not MetallicA, this is Metallica trying to keep up with other bands and updated metal. They cut their hair, started wearing make up, and playing blues style rock while drinkin martini's instead of an old fashioned beer can, get me? Load is different in deed, too different. All though they did surprise me with a few good songs such as ''Hero of the Day,King Nothing,Until it Sleeps, and Bleeding Me (The best one on the album). Im not angry or hate them for it, im just not used to it, but still it's Metallica and it was just a fase. Buy this at a yard sale or flea market for cheap, dont pay the full price.
B000127LW2|4.0|Nominated for 30 Emmys, including seven for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series, Star Trek: Voyager continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its fan base. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. The third spin-off from the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager premiered in January 1995 to modest critical acclaim, but experienced great success with television viewers, slowly increasing its ratings as the series progressed. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), the series precedes Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) while boasting an all-star cast that includes veteran actress Kate Mulgrew (whose past TV appearances include such shows as Dallas, Cheers, and Murphy Brown). Yet instead of pursuing the classic Star Trek mission to \\"boldly go where no one has gone before,\\" Star Trek: Voyager is more about going where the crew has been before... <br /> <br />Star Trek: Voyager follows the exploits of the crew aboard the starship USS Voyager. As the series begins, the Voyager is on a Federation mission to capture a rogue ship of Maquis rebels (a race first introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). While in pursuit of the Maquis, the Voyager enters a system known as the badlands, and both ships are instantaneously transported to the Delta Quadrant over seventy-thousand light years away on the outskirts of the galaxy. Soon, both the Maquis and the crew of Voyager learn they were brought to Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, a mysterious force overseeing the safety of the Ocampan race who live inthe shadow on an impending threat from the vicious Kazon. When the Kazon destroy the Maquis ship, the Voyager crew merges with the Maquis crew to defend themselves from the Kazon. Having destroyed the device which could bring them home, the crew of the Voyager - led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), and the crew of the Maquis ship - led by Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), must work as a united front in order to meet their mutual goal of finding a way home... <br /> <br /> <br />The Star Trek: Voyager (Season 1) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the series premiere \\"Caretaker\\" in which the Federation starship USS Voyager, led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway, is unexpectedly transported 70,000 light years away while pursuing a band of Maquis rebels through an area known as the badlands. The Voyager's new destination is the Delta Quadrant, an uncharted region of the galaxy overseen by the Caretaker and threatened by the colonial aggression of the Kazon... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include \\"The Cloud\\" in which the Voyager accidentally injures an alien life form while searching for an ingredient to boost its energy supply, and \\"Learning Curve\\" in which members of Commander Chakotay's ragtag Maquis crew are given a Starfleet Academy tutorial on how to act properly aboard the Voyager... <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes included on the Star Trek: Voyager (Season 1) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 1 (Caretaker: Part 1) <br />Episode 2 (Caretaker: Part 2) <br />Episode 3 (Parallax) <br />Episode 4 (Time and Again) <br />Episode 5 (Phage) <br />Episode 6 (The Cloud) <br />Episode 7 (Eye of the Needle) <br />Episode 8 (Ex Post Facto) <br />Episode 9 (Emanations) <br />Episode 10 (Prime Factors) <br />Episode 11 (State of Flux) <br />Episode 12 (Heroes and Demons) <br />Episode 13 (Cathexis) <br />Episode 14 (Faces) <br />Episode 15 (Jetrel) <br />Episode 16 (Learning Curve) <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00005O5CM|5.0|This is a very funny movie starring Reese Witherspoon. The jokes were funny, and the story just kept moving right along. I personally thought the part where they found out the pool guy was gay was really funny! This movie proves that you can be blonde AND smart! I am looking forward to seeing the sequel to this great flick.
B000000I0Q|4.0|I've given 4 stars here but really think it comes in just below that. Not penultimate classic prog but still very good. Phil Collins always blows me away when ever he got behind the kit in this period (genesis, brand x) and there is a fabulous example of this on the tail end of the song Ace of Wands and in Star of Sirius (my fav).  <br /> <br />Steve is a very good guitarist and very imaginative in the way that chords were grouped and themes generated through the album. At times you could just fall asleep and then it comes in with some superb odd times that jolt you from your slumber. Nice ;) <br /> <br />The only critique in a bad way for this album would be the repetiveness of themes from verse to chorus, etc. this is probably an indication that it is a solo album and the main input is from the solo artist. <br /> <br />still very good and a nice journey back in time, and some great ballads for those gentle mornings when you need some vintage 12 string guitar! <br /> <br />a definite for any collector of the best period of prog, early to mid 70's.
B000002HRE|3.0|This album is maybe one star better for their small effort of trying to redeem thereselves by recording ''The Unforgivin II'' from their huge ''Black'' album, but still reuin every other song with short timing, not good solo's or riffs and slower pace in the music, but still a better album than ''Load''. This one contains three pretty good tunes such as ''Fuel,The Memory Remains, and The Unforgivin II'' and ''Low Man's Lyric'' is really good too if you listen to all of it. I would say go ahead and buy this one if you like MetallicA it's definatly and upgrade from ''Load''
B000002KFJ|4.0|Well, i have this album on cassette tape, not the CD... yet. <br /> <br />Out of all of the Osbourne-era albums, i gotta put 'Sabotage' at the top of the list. I feel that this is where the original Black Sabbath truly peaked, both experimentaly and artisticaly. Whit 'Sabbath,Bloody Sabbath', the album right before this one, you could  hear the groundwork for 'Sabotage' being laid out. All of the idea's and experimentation on 'Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath' come fully realized and brought out to their absolute maximum potential on 'Sabotage'. I know that there are fans who will disagree with me on this being one of the bands greatest outputs, fans who still think 'Paranoid' or 'Master of Reality' are better then the latter experimental Black Sabbath that started with 'Volume 4', all i can say is that they are really missing out. I find it appauling how the four songs off of 'Paranoid' get all the attention (\\"War Pigs\\", \\"Paranoid\\", \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"Faries Wear Boots\\") and radio airplay, yet you will never hear \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" or \\"Megalomania\\" on the radio. <br /> <br />You get 8 cuts on this album and it runs for about 43 minutes or so. Some of the longest and almost proggish songs Black Sabbath ever wrote call this platter home.\\"Hole in the Sky\\" is your basic mid-paced rocker, and it's not bad, but the album gets alot better after that. \\"Megolomania\\" runs for almost 10 minutes and is probably the greatest song they ever wrote, \\"The Writ\\" is a 9-minute attack on their managment and \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" is a 7-minute crusher that stomps on the brake pedal for a dreamy mid-section. You also get two instramentals, \\"Don't Start (Too Late)\\" which is just Tony playing around on a flamenco guitar and the cryptic \\"Supertzar\\" which features Tony playing a downtrodden riff aginst a chamber choir, Tony Iommi has always had a penchant for these weird sounding tracks. People bash \\"Am I Going Insane\\" a lot, but i don't think it is that bad, it is decent. Even though i don't like Ozzy's vocal work, he does put out a great preformance hear, probably the best of his career. It is a well rounded album, only one filler (Am I Going Insane) and bucket loads of memorable riffs, plus cool looking cover art.   <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|The history of rock music is littered with classic albums which fans didn't `get' when they were first released.  Think of Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd), Back in Black (AC/DC) - even Radiohead's Kid A.  It is clear from the critical reviews of Mezmerize on this site that many fans expected and wanted a new Toxicity.  But what would be the point of that?  System of a Down have progressed with each album, and Mezmerize is no exception.  Don't believe the dumbos above.  This is a magnificent piece of work that is an absolute pleasure to listen to.  Six stars out of Five, no less...
B0002858YS|4.0|a delectable piece of pop that evokes a nice combination between nostalgia for the eighties and promise for the future. This band has done their homework and, like the awesome, electrifying Kaiser Chiefs, are blazing an exciting new trail for pop music.
B000002H97|5.0|This is without a doubt, one of the greatest albums of all time, but it was also the last, and this album gives you everything you crave. Example if your in the mood for Headbanging, skip over to ''Sad But True,Enter Sandman,My Friend of Misery,or Don't Tread on Me'' and if your in the mood for quality smoother, more leaned back try ''The Unforgivin,Nothing Else Matters or Wherever I May Roam''. This record is the grand fanale to pure metal, and im glad MetallicA were the ones who took it on and ended it with one last Rock & Roll ride. Buy this and Master of Puppets, MetallicA's Greatest album.
B00005NNMJ|3.0|Accept's fifth album is by far their most well-known, giving them a breif period of fame with the song \\"Balls to the Wall\\" which got regular rotation as a music video on MTV back in 1984. <br /> <br />There are many who claim this to be one of the greatest 80's metal albums ever made, but i beg to differ, i feel that it has some good moments but it has too many mediocre ones that far outweigh it to make me rate this more then 3 stars. For me, a true 5-star album has no flaws or wasted moments at all, utterly perfect in every concivable way, this is far from that. <br /> <br />This album is average at best, i hate to say it, but \\"Restless and Wild\\" was much better then this. If you wanted to check this group out, i would get the live CD \\"Staying A Life\\" which has all of the best songs from them instead of this or any of their studio albums, why? because Accept has never REALLY been able to put out a consistant studio album in their whole career. I will probably get ripped for that statement, but it is true, if you listen to any Accept album ( i own everything from 'Breaker' to 'Russian Roulette'), you will notice a pattern where the album will start off with 3 good songs then completely go down hill with songs that arn't memorable at all and could care less about.'Balls to the Wall' is no execption, it starts with the best song of the album, the title track \\"Balls to the Wall\\", which is great. The next track is \\"London Leather Boys\\" which is a cool and catchy metal tune. \\"Fight It Back\\" is a fast-paced song and is the last really good song here. \\"Head Over Heels\\" has a good intro and sounds like it will be another great song, but quickly becomes repeatative, just like the track after it, \\"Losing More Then You Ever Had\\". \\"Love Child\\" is nothing special at all, as well as \\"Turn Me On\\", both songs are dispensable 80's metal tunes with juvinile, sex oriented lyrics which all bands of that era did. \\"Losers And Winners\\" is a average song hidden behind a cool chorus and \\"Gaurdian Of The Night\\" is hardly memorable at all. Things pick up with the last song though, \\"Winter Dreams\\", which is beautiful and melodic, i was surprised to hear Udo sing soothing and softly like that, considering he is a canadate for possessing one of the worst voices in the entire human race. That is probably one of the things that stopped this band from making it big, not many people could \\"Accept\\" the sound of Udo's \\"Brain Johnson meets a chalkboard against a chainsaw\\" voice. Sure, Wolf Hoffmann was one of the best guitar players ever, up there with Van Halen and George Lynch as far as 80's metal guitarist go, but still, the band just didn't sound that much differant from any other heavy metal group back then, after all, people were calling them AC/DC and Judas Preist thrown in a blender.  <br /> <br />Basically, the only worthy tracks are 1,2,3 and 10, and i don't even count bonus tracks so don't ask about them. I really think that any of Udo's solo work in U.D.O. is much better then this, for one thing, they sound ulta modern and cutting edge, this thing sounds extremely dated and you can tell it is from the 80's, hardly timeless at all. It is not horrible per se, it is just not that particularly great in anyway, i could think of better albums that represent 80s metal. 'Balls To The Wall' is just kind of overrated i think.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|An unbelievable disappointment. Once more, another studio has failed to make a decent film because they are trying too hard for mass-market appeal. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are decent actors, but failed to even engage as their characters and the script were so one dimensional. <br /> <br />Too reliant on special effects instead of a decent story, this film understandably flopped. When will the studios learn?
B000065U1N|5.0|I ordered this movie for one purpose: to watch it ofcourse. I loved it when it first came out and decided i wanted to watch it over and over again. When it arrived everything was fine no damages nothing like that during shipping. I would definitly recommend buying this movie!
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets,in mine and alot of other people's opinion,Is the greatest album in metal history. This is the album that jumpstarted MetallicA,giving them their army of devoted fans. Every song on this album is magic. With all four original band memebers with Cliff Burton (R.I.P) on bass. My Personal favorites are ''Battery,Master of Puppets,The Thing That Should Not Be,Sanitarium,and Damage Inc.'' Here is a list of the songs and i'll rate them for you in stars from 1 to 5 for the best ones. <br />          1.Battery ****1/2  <br />          2.Master of Puppets ***** (one word..MASTERpiece) <br />          3.The Thing That Should Not Be **** (Melow,great sound) <br />          4.Welcome Home (Sanitarium) ***** (Best song on the album!!) <br />          5.Disposable Heroes ***1/2 <br />          6.Lepar Messiah **** (Great song) <br />          7.Orion ****1/2 (instrumental, yet awsome music) <br />          8.Damage Inc. ***** (You'll LOVE this one) <br />
6301797906|5.0|A great movie and great teaching tool on many levels.
0790729652|1.0|Firstly, who's idea was it to cast Michael Keaton as Batman? They must have been on drugs at the time of that decision (and probably the same person that cast Stallone as Judge Dredd). As a fan of the comic book, it takes a lot for someone like me to actually prefer to watch the awfully camp antics of Adam West. Why? Because at least nobody could take his character seriously. Keaton was too old, short, weedy, uncharismatic and plain ugly to be Batman - but okay, he's a half-decent actor.<br /><br />Secondly, why Tim Burton as the director? He's too self-obsessed to ever do the character justice and always has to add his quirkiness to every film, even if the story or character do not justify his style. Tim - this is supposed to be dark! It is about 6-year old boy, who after seeing his parents brutally gunned down in front of his eyes, devoted his entire childhood, and adulthood into becoming the perfect crime-fighting machine. He is the worlds greatest detective, innovator and fighter of all arts - but also a man who is tormented. Erm...I don't really feel this came across somehow. If anything, Burton himself didn't have enough faith in the character, which is why Batman had to rely on rubber 'muscle' suits and often got beaten up too easily. Did he not see Superman? Pretty unbelievable stuff, but a superb film (also very well cast) and the audiences liked it! Give the imagination of the audience more credit.<br /><br />Despite Warner having the DC character rights, it consistently messes up in its adaptations because it tries to be too mass-market. They should take lessons from Marvel adaptations like X-men, Spiderman and The Hulk where huge efforts are made to stick to the essence of the original comic book characters - from storyline through to casting. What you then get is a richer, more refined film (more refined because the stories and characters are based on decades of literary evolution as opposed to a third rate story knocked up in a few weeks) that will also appeal to true fans - these are the type of fans that spend loads of money too! If you want a good example, just look at Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Anyway, the Batmobile looked good, the Batcave was OK and Nicolson made a passable Joker - but that's it. Bad news was Burton directed a sequel (with Keaton again - argh!), good news is that Batman Begins was actually quite good - maybe Warner have learned their lesson after all...fans - these are the type of fans that spend loads of money too!

B00005JNSK|3.0|There's a reason that the 1970s Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has endured for so long as a beloved classic despite being a box office bomb. The fact of the matter is that the film had a script written by the author of the book, and it had a story that had heart, performances that were memorable, fun songs, deep, well-developed characters, and best of all a fantastic performance by Gene Wilder.  Sure there are parts where it strayed from the book, but in all it stayed as true as possible with the technology available at the time.<br /><br />  This remake by the usually great Tim Burton, and the usually amazing Johnny Depp did not capture the magic of the original. Rather than spending time developing the characters the film seems like it's the classic tale in fast forward. They rush through the finding of the Golden Tickets; there's lack of consumer frenzy that was well portrayed in the original, and it is simply glanced over here. I thought that it was possible that Tim Burton was just eager to show the world the wonders of the chocolate factory, however, where the original took its time getting people acquainted with Willy Wonka, and the factory, and everyone else, the fast forward momentum of the remake doesn't slow once inside the factory, in fact it gets worse. There's still so much of the story that Burton missed out on in his rush to create a hurried popcorn flick with little to no heart. I left the theater wanting to like this movie, but Depp wasn't Wily Wonka, he was a great character, but he wasn't Wonka. Wilder is still Wonka, true to the book, and true to form. Depp's performance came off more like an interpretation of Michael Jackson meets Captain Kangaroo meets Mr. Rogers. Anyone but Wily Wonka.<br /><br /> I also did not appreciate Burton's boasting about how much more like the book this movie would be when only a few things stood out, (though it has been a long time since I read the book) Veruca's disposal at the hands of squirrels rather than Golden Geese, and Charlie's not getting himself into trouble as well. There were other little things too, but all in all, you get the sense that the original wasn't too far off base after all. After all the original was only guilty of the sin of omission, mostly, and what content they added in its place helped make a deeper, more enjoyable story. This one omits things, and adds a very unintuitive back-story for Wonka that is neither necessary, nor does it help the classic tale in any way.<br /><br />Too much time was spent on flash, and not enough on substance. It feels like the film itself has a short attention span, and I walked out of the theater wanting so badly to like this one... I just can't justify it. This was another unnecessary remake, which has done nothing to help the story in any way, or do much else besides create a mildly entertaining visual treat for the audience. It would have been nice to have more depth, and with Burton's track record, it's highly disappointing that it didn't.<br /><br /> In truth you cannot out do the original author's vision for a movie. As a writer myself I can attest that the book version of my stories would be very different from the movie. What works in books don't always work in movies, and I think that Burton's challenge to the original film here doesn't need to be met. This remake is too weak to stand the test of time. Nothing about it is anywhere near as memorable or as enduring as the original Wily Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, nor is it as magical, and heart filled as the book.Geese, and Charlie's not getting himself into trouble as well. There were other little things too, but all in all, you get the sense that the original wasn't too far off base after all. After all the original was only guilty of the sin of omission, mostly, and what content they added in its place helped make a deeper, more enjoyable story. This one omits things, and adds a very unintuitive back-story for Wonka that is neither necessary, nor does it help the classic tale in any way.  <br />Too much time was spent on flash, and not enough on substance. It feels like the film itself has a short attention span, and I walked out of the theater wanting so badly to like this one... I just can't justify it. This was another unnecessary remake, which has done nothing to help the story in any way, or do much else besides create a mildly entertaining visual treat for the audience. It would have been nice to have more depth, and with Burton's track record, it's highly disappointing that it didn't.  <br /> In truth you cannot out do the original author's vision for a movie. As a writer myself I can attest that the book version of my stories would be very different from the movie. What works in books don't always work in movies, and I think that Burton's challenge to the original film here doesn't need to be met. This remake is too weak to stand the test of time. Nothing about it is anywhere near as memorable or as enduring as the original Wily Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, nor is it as magical, and heart filled as the book. <br />
B000002H6C|5.0|...And Justice for All is my second favorite MetallicA album (#1 Master of Puppets) But this record has more improved instrument playing, breathtaking vocals by James and heart stopping drums and guitar by Lars and Kirk. The best songs on this cd in my opinion is ''Blackened,...And Justice For All,Eye of the Beholder,Harvester of Sorrow,and Dyer's Eve''. oh, hehe and who can forget the greatest song ever made ''ONE''!!!! the story of the soldier from war who was disabled by the landmine that has ''TAKEN MY SIGHT,TAKEN MY HEARING,TAKIN MY ARMS,TAKEN MY LEGS,TAKEN MY SOUL, LEFT ME WITH LIFE IN HELL!!'' Buy this and Master of Puppets or The Black Album

B000002H2H|4.0|Ride the Lightning, MetallicA's 2nd shockwave of heavy metal tunes. I gave this record only 4 stars because of ''Trapped Under Ice, and Escape'' Probabley the weakest songs of their old school era. This one holds several of MetallicA's greatest such as ''For Whom the Bell Tolls,Ride the Lightning,Creeping Death,Fight Fire With Fire, and last but not least, FADE TO BLACK the song that sold the album and brought the others to everyones attention. This is a great cd, just disregard the two i mentioned. Buy this and Kill 'Em All for total 80's bar room metal.
0316172324|1.0|I really wanted to like this book before reading it.  I had heard so much about it and though perhaps it had potential, but alas, no.  It was just horrible.  I don't really have anything good to say about it.  I just can't believe it's garnered as much media time as it has.  Don't waste your time on this book.
0671027344|1.0|I read this in a day and it bored me to tears. It starts out with Charlie's \\"best friend\\" Michael's suicide, (which is supposedly one of the themes of the book) but it is barely mentioned. We never know what is wrong with Charlie, because he shows some sort of mental disability that can only be seen by the keen eye. I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. I'm the exact same age as Charlie and I have no idea where he is coming from.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|While not really a fan of Joss Whedon's \\"Buffy\\" or \\"Angel\\", I found \\"Firefly\\" to be an excellent series! Basically it's the old west meets space, with a lot of diversity in character development and episode plots. A nice balance of humour and drama, and unexpected actions. Overall, it is one of the best series I've ever seen.
0767020308|4.0|This film shows the story of once wicked girl who decides to mend her ways.  It shows some of the problems that some girls have as they grow up.  This movie is about matchmaking, romance, and love.  It shows a the depth of love from a man for a woman he loves in a very touching way.
B0001HAISG|4.0|In my opinion, the Peter Pan movie is the most fantastic fantasy movie I've ever seen, beating The Lord Of the Ring and Harry Potter in my personal record as I've seen it more than 130 times, while LOR or HP less than 100 times. <br />This Peter Pan version is the version I'd wished to see, the romance between Peter and Wendy. Not to mention how cute both Jeremy and Rachel were, what a lovely couple!
B00079018K|4.0|I like this record. At times it reminds me of Stereo MCs sprinked with the Verve. Its pretty powerful stuff. The weakest tune is without a doubt \\"Running Battle\\". I skip over it every tyime. <br /> <br />Other than that, a good well-rounded record.
B0007P3582|1.0|So I woke up one mourning on top of my covers, put my pants on two legs at a time, walked down stairs and found that I was standing on my kitchen roof and that the stove was planted above me. As I walked out to my car, I noticed the sky looked rather odd, sort of a dark red colour, and the sun was absent, in it's place a wheel of monterey jack cheese. I got to work and found US president Ralph Nader standing beside my reserved parking space with a plaque that read; \\"thank you for your noble service to our country\\" (being third shift manager at \\"burger world\\" has it's honorable moments, I suppose). After being greeted by thousands of media heads and ronald mcdonald himself, I was told by my boss to take the rest of the day off, with pay. I spent the rest of my mourning, afternoon and evening playing beach volleyball with 3 eyed space creatures, one of which was kinda hot, and by 160 o'clock, I was ready to call it a day. I got back into my car, which had somehow transformed from a 87' geo to a 05' escalade with spinners ;), and started my drive home. Once into my house, I decided to pick up the newspaper. I opened up to the front page, and saw the strangest thing. The headline read; \\"The Billboard top 3  for skooterday, floontober 57th, xj79 are: 3. Gwen stephani-Holla back girl/ 2. Ciara- goodies and #1. 50cent - Candy shop. It was then, and only then, that I realized I wasn't in kansas anymore. Bye.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Thankfully, I did not buy this CD, only had a copy given to me. I've listened to this CD more than a dozen times, and I still cannot find solid melodies to latch onto. This latest effort is a huge disappointment, because I really enjoyed their first two albums. I have seen them twice in concert, and they really put on a good show. But X&Y is what I would categorize very nearly as \\"non-music\\". It's very nearly what Robert Fripp does with his \\"frippertronics\\" or what Dave Matthews Band does with their \\"jam\\" songs. There is no structure to the song, there is no melody that you can recall after listening to it. That is, X&Y lacks the basic components of what music should be about: a pleasing, consistent quality of enjoyment. And I would not categorize this as sounding like Radiohead *at all* (I'm a big fan of Radiohead, and I don't understand how people can compare Coldplay to Radiohead), nor would I say this is sounding like U2. I don't know why people make those comparisons. Radiohead is much more moody music, with variety of melodies, song structures, and instrumentation. U2 has a much more full and sometimes gritty sound than Coldplay. On X&Y, Coldplay has lost their way, unfortunately. No song is a standout, except \\"Speed of Sound\\", and that sounds as it was recorded during their \\"Rush of Blood\\" studio period. I will admit that the other songs on X&Y do have moments of little latches and melodies, but, honestly, after 2 weeks of listening, nothing sticks to me. There is not one single song that makes me say, \\"Wow, yeah, I remember that tune, let's listen to that again.\\" No, it's all completely and utterly forgettable. What a shame. It goes to show you that you cannot rest on what you've done in the past to go into the future. Let's hope the band learns a lesson and moves on (or back) to better musical efforts.
B000021Y7X|5.0|This concert, coupled with the live recordings of \\"The Name of this Band Is Talking Heads\\" show a band that skipped lightly on punk, new wave and landed somewhere between funk and world music. David Byrne is the captain of this ship, but he couldn't get where he's going without his able and willing crew. I confess that the only \\"restroom moment\\" (when I'm prone to wander from the room) is during Tom-Tom Club's \\"Genius of Love.\\" The DVD has some of the best concert hall sound I've heard, and maybe by the end you'll be able to answer that lingering question: \\"Why a big suit?\\"
068987474X|5.0|This book, like a lot of things in life, is what you make of it.  Yes, it is trendy.  Yes, it is at times tongue-in-cheek.  Yes, it forces you to listen to some things about yourself that you'd rather not hear.  But its simplicity is refreshing, and at the end of the day, if you allow yourself, you will walk away with a new perspective on life and relationships and restored confidence.  It does not provide the magic answer on how to find a mate (even if there was a magic answer), but it does provide the tools to optimistically get back to reality and stop wasting your time.  It is not just about finding out who's \\"just not that into you,\\" it's about freeing yourself to be found by the person who is.  \\"Don't waste the pretty\\" is the best advice I've heard in years -  and worth repeating anytime you fall back into the old habit of overanalyzing a guy's behavior.  If he doesn't appreciate what you have to offer - someone else will.  The least you can do is give him that chance...

B00091SMJQ|5.0|If you have the other Bruce Dickinson remasters series from Sanctuary and not this 2 disc collection, you're missing out on a lot. Not only is the sound quality better than the single disc edition with the austrialian bonus tracks, you get more and better bonus tracks on this edition. That aside, this is one of Bruce Dickinson's best solo albums. It was the first of his solo albums that he recorded. He recorded this while he was still in Iron Maiden. Although it has a different feel than the Iron Maiden material, it proves that Bruce Dickinson can do almost anything and sound good. I highly recommend Iron Maiden and/or Bruce Dickinson fans to purchase this 2 disc set, whether you have the original or not.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|What drew my interest to Surfjan Steven's ILLINOIS is the fact that I had read a lot about him in music magazines Rolling Stone and Spin.  There, Illinois received very respectable reviews, so I thought that I would try ILLINOIS for myself.  Boy am I glad that I did!  This album is a masterpiece to say the least about it.<br /><br />Stevens captivates your attention not only by his pure voice, but also by his ambitious and unique arrangements.  You can tell that Stevens has a background of some sort in instrumental music (band/orchestral) because he loves to incorporate that into his singer/songwriter driven songs.  The arrangements here are so diverse;  they range from spare arrangements featuring piano and nothing much more, to acoustic guitar/banjo driven arrangements, to full on strings, brass, woodwinds, guitars, vibes, synths, and chorus!  You can feel ambition oozing from Stevens through his arrangements alone.  There is not one song that doesn't have an interesting, mind-toying arrangement.<br /><br />Not being overshadowed by the arrangments is Stevens's solid songwriting.  His lyrics are so poetic and credible while still having a chorus/hook to captivate the listener.  While Stevens has an incredibly mellow voice, it never grows dull or boring.  Stevens makes you want to continue to listen as he intrigues you more and more and more.  His songwriting abilities are also unique because they are so much outside of the box and sometimes you think they just evolve from left field.  You don't see that kind of uniqueness or innovation from a lot of artists today.<br /><br />While I like all the songs on this album very much, my favorites include \\"Come On! Feel the Illinoise...\\" (which features unique changing of textures, a jazz feel, and nice arrangment with trumpet riffs, etc..), \\"Chicago\\" (absolutely beautiful), \\"The Man of Metroplis Steals Our Hearts\\" (which contrasts acoustic and electric arrangements very effectively), \\"They Are Night Zombies...\\" and \\"The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulders...\\" (which features use of non-metrical meter, funky drums, oboe, flutes, vibes, etc...).  Overall, I have never heard anything like this before, and I would very much like to hear some of Surfjan's other albums including his first \\"state-themed\\" album Michigan.  Excellent, again a masterpiece where there are few in this day and age. 5 stars.est Shoulders...\\" (which features use of non-metrical meter, funky drums, oboe, flutes, vibes, etc...).

B00005JNSK|5.0|For anyone born before say, 1980, the following words are enough to strike fear and giggles into the hearts of lads and lasses everywhere: \\"There's no earthly way of knowing which direction we are going. There's no knowing where we're rowing. Or which way the river's flowing. Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is a hurricane a blowing?\\" This is the chant that a deranged-looking Gene Wilder uttered as his magic gondola sailed down the chocolate river in 1971's \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\". It is a film that has delighted and spooked children for more than 30 years. And I had the pleasure of going to see this wonderful retelling of the now-named \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" not too long ago. The direction of Tim Burton (\\"Batman\\", \\"Sleepy Hollow\\") was nothing short of extraordinary! The performance of Johnny Depp (\\"Secret Window\\") as Willy Wonka was top-notch and hilarious! Supporting players include Freddie Highmore (\\"Finding Neverland\\") as Charlie Bucket, David Kelly (\\"Waking Ned Devine\\"), Helena Bonham Carter (\\"Fight Club\\"), Noah Taylor (\\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\"), and Christopher Lee (\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy), in which they all gave unforgettable performances! <br /> <br />For those who don't know the story, then hop into my gondola, everyone, and I'll tell you a little about a guy named Willy Wonka (Depp). He owns a big candy factory, and nobody's been in it for 15 years. And yet, it's been producing candy all this while. But how, if nobody comes in or out, does the candy get made? Little Charlie Bucket (Highmore) would like to know. He's a poor boy living on the outskirts of the Wonka factory in a strange, dilapidated house where his four ancient grandparents sleep in one large bed (two at the foot and two at the head). One day, after years of silence, Wonka announces to the world that he is putting five \\"golden tickets\\" into his delicious Wonka Bars, and the children who get them will be treated to a tour of the Wonka factory and vie for a chance to win a special prize at the end of the visit. <br /> <br />Needless to say, Charlie gets one of the tickets, as do a quartet of prepubescent horrors: fat and gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), spoiled rich kid Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), competitive gum-smacker Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb, \\"Because of Winn-Dixie\\"), and the video-game-obsessed brat Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry). Wonka doesn't like these kids. He has unique ways of expressing disdain for each. And, in fact, each of the kids leaves the tour early, picked off by their own excesses. (Augustus falls into the chocolate river, Violet becomes a giant blueberry, etc.) We know throughout the movie that Charlie, along with his Grandpa Joe (Kelly), will make it all the way based on his kindness and manners. But what is the special prize? <br /> <br />While Charlie is more fleshed out and real than the moppet of the first film, Wonka himself is a bizarre amalgam of Michael Jackson and Oscar Wilde -- only more androgynous than Michael and dandier than Oscar (imagine that!). Whereas Wilder's Willy Wonka was mischievously wise, Depp's is neurotic. He has family issues -- he can't bring himself to say \\"parent\\" -- from a troubled childhood with an overbearing dentist father (Lee). Wonka is not merely whimsical here. He is weird. <br /> <br />Some may consider Depp's creation a miscalculation. But what kind of person could create a factory of such imagination and craziness and not be somehow crazy and imaginary in the process? The factory is a marvel -- very much like the one of the earlier film at first but more expansive and magical as it goes along. There are special effects now that were undreamt in 1971, and they are put to enchanting use. What exactly Roald Dahl's book and this film promotes in terms of childhood virtues is elusive. Is it moderate appreciation of candy? Respect for imagination? This is unclear. Crystal clear, however, is this: Quibble as you may, besides \\"Batman Begins\\", thisis the most imaginative and delightful film so far this summer. It is a feast for the eyes and ears. (The Oompa Loompas, Wonka's trusty and diminutive servants, all played by Deep Roy, engage in dazzling production numbers, each themed around the exit of a bratty child. The horn section really soars.) <br /> <br />And the chemistry between the strange Wonka and the responsible Charlie is touching and, at times, heartbreaking. This is Burton's most complete and rewarding film in years, especially since \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\", and certainly in a year full of \\"Fantastic Four\\"s and \\"Bewitched\\"s, \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" succeeds as the most reverential and enjoyable remake. See it, either right now in the theaters or on DVD when it's released!

Not because it's gross but because it's just...sigh...there isn't a word for this.<br /><br />I am almost certain that the majority of these people that write this crap in movies are drunk, horney, 13 year old's. It's sick that these people make tons of money to produce meaningless garbage. I loved the video games and these movies were nothing like it. Nothing.<br /><br />Were any of you aware that George Romero (like I have to say it...but the creator of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead) wrote a screen play for the first Resident Evil. I've read it and it rocked, it had characters from the game in it and everything, but noooooOooOo. They had to go Hollywood and use the script that someone puked on and called it a movie. I'm just tired of seeing this crap made when there is a true horror genius out there that no one wants to hear from.<br /><br />Don't buy or rent any of the R.E.'s go to the video store or Best Buy and buy or rent \\"Night\\", \\"Dawn\\" and \\"Day\\"...even the Tom Savini \\"Night\\" remake that rocked too, then see Land of the Dead. Those movies will show you what can be accomplished when you put a little heart into your movies.<br /><br />It's just sad that they can take something so good and just reduce it to utter crap.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because at least the zombies didn't run.
B0000TB050|5.0|This DVD is interesting because it is a look at U2 from a very different angle than fans have had before. Sure, it's another concert DVD, but the fact that it is filmed in front of such a large hometown crowd completely changes the dynamic and feel of the entire experience. How would they change the show to fit with their original and most loyal fan base?  Well, from the beginning it feels as if the band knows every single person in the audience. Yep, all 200,000 or however many of them there were. There's a palpable and tangible familiarity that is captured on this film, and Bono especially takes full advantage of it. You would be hard-pressed to find a more involved and devoted crowd, as they had been waiting all day for U2 to come one after many other acts.   As other reviewers have noted, Bono's father Paul Hewson passed away just days before this concert was filmed. So one gets the sense that this show was poised for emotional greatness, with so many different events converging: playing at home, a massive crowd, the death of Bono's father, and a tour that had become a steamrolling success, building in momentum with each stop.   Without going through each track, I will say that this DVD can't really be compared to the Boston DVD. Boston was filmed in an arena, with a much smaller crowd, and a different setlist. This DVD was filmed in Ireland, outdoors, in front of almost 200,000 people. Neither is superior to the other, simply because they are so different.   This particular concert has an exquisite setlist, with the highlight for me being All I Want Is You (dedicated to Bono's wife Ali) transitioning into Where The Streets Have No Name. This is simply an explosion of power and emotion, and the energy is passed from Bono, through the entire crowd, and back into him and the band. An unforgettable moment, and one that you will certainly replay numerous times on this DVD. Angel of Harlem is also great to hear live, as is One, which they rarely play anymore. For someone who is so intensely private about his family, Bono does mention his wife and also brings his daughter Eve up on stage during the bonus track (Mysterious Ways).   The one comparison I will make to the Boston DVD pertains to the respective performances of Bullet The Blue Sky. The Boston performance of this song is absolutely mind-blowing, incendiary and devastating, due to Bono's improvisation toward the end. It seems that the arena is ready to explode trying to hold in the energy. This is lacking somewhat on the Ireland performance, which also contains different references that aren't USA-specific. I personally like the Boston performance more, but Sinead O'Connor does a beautiful intro on the Ireland performance.   Overall, this is a DVD that you will watch over and over, and it complements the Boston DVD, rather than taking anything away from it.

Hands down the best producer in the rap game ever, and it shows once again on this album, one of the best produced albums I ever heard.  He produces 16 of the 17 songs on here, and they're brilliant (Lord Finesse does 1 songs, and it's also very good).  It has 3 classics, 2 I skip, 2 ok songs, and the rest are mostly great songs.

One of the best on the album. <br /> <br />8: My Iron Lung-10/10 This song was written in responce to the success of Creep. I love the chorus, its sounds chaotic at first but then starts to sound amazing. <br /> <br />9: Bulletproof...I wish I was-8.5/10 See 'High and Dry' <br /> <br />10: Black Star-10/10 I love this song! Its one of the most underrated on the album, which I dont see why, its definitely a standout. <br /> <br />11: Sulk-10/10 Great song! I didn't like it the first time I listened to it, but then it gradually grew on me like all the other great Radiohead songs. <br /> <br />12: Street Sprit (Fade Out)-10/10 This song is just amazing. The arpeggios drive the song forward, until it climaxes, and then ends this amazing album with the words \\"Immerse your soul in love.\\" This is the second best album closer, just behind \\"A Wolf At the Door.\\" <br /> <br />Overall: This is the best of Radiohead! A must have to anyone, Radiohead fan or not! <br /> <br />I would like to say something to the people who say thatThom's voice is \\"whiny\\" If hes voice is as \\"whiny\\" as you say it is, he manages to make \\"whining\\" into the most beaultiful art imaginable. <br /> <br />-Nathan
1401206905|5.0|If you come to this book looking for end-to-end Batman action, you may come away surprised, but I doubt you'll be disappointed. In tone, this book shares something with Miller's preceding Batman opus, The Dark Night Returns, in that it sets up the whole milieu in which Batman appears, the culture on which he's trying to make an impact. <br /> <br />It is also as much about Jim Gordon as it is about Bruce Wayne/Batman. Other key players in the Batman passion-play make appearances of varying impact (Alfred, Selina Kyle, Harvey Dent), but by and large this book lays out how Gordon and the Batman become unlikely partners. It's well-done, laying out step-by-step how this man who is so obviously commited to the idea of the rule of law comes to trust and even work with a man who believes that rule of law must take second place to justice. This is as much a story about a upright cop making his way in a corrupt police force as it is about Bruce donning the tights, and is the stronger for it. <br /> <br />Miller's great strength is characterisation and this book is no exception - much of it is in fact scripted as interior monologues from Gordon and Bruce, and he effectively evokes the way each character thinks. What spoken dialogue appears in the book is sparingly used, almost like a noir thriller. In fact, one can see elements from this book carrying through into the Sin City books that Miller began writing soon after. <br /> <br />Mazucchelli's art is excellent, walking a fine line - as he himself admits - between the realism that the noir approach demands, and the the fantastical that a guy running around in a cape throwing batarangs equally requires. As he says, superheroes don't really stand up to realistic representation, it needs that step of artistic remove to 'keep it real'. Still, the art is excellent in a gritty, kinetic way that seems relatively normal now but was striking back in the mid-80s. <br /> <br />And if you are looking at this book after having seen Batman Begins, and wondering if there's a connection, just buy it and try to spot how many things Cris Nolan lifted from it wholesale...

0393317552|5.0|This is one of those astounding bits of research that, once you read it, you will wonder why it took humans so long to reach these conclusions.  It is lucid and, for the most part, fascinating.    The premise is fairly straightforward: the more surplus food a society has the more time it has to develop technology and complex culture.  The more productive and easier to domestic plants and animals orginated in and spread from the Fertile Crescent west to Europe and North Africa and east to China. Read the book to find out why these plants and animals could spread east and west and could not be spread far north and south and why the earliest civilizations were the first to collapse.  Contrary to what you might read or infer, the book is about as political as mail delivery.  Even so, it has been a serious disappointment to white racists who still need to believe in the myth of white supremacy in its many guises, academic and otherwise.    The title of the book is a bit misleading.  By the time the guns, germs and steel arise as factors in the rise of Europe, the Europeans are well on the way to developing the tools they will use to colonize the world. The divisions of labor made possible by surplus food supplies are already developed. This is but one of the many reasons you should read the book to get the details and the big picture.    The premise of this book, if not the work itself, is as important as the concept that all humans have basic inalienable rights.  Let us hope that both concepts spread quickly before it is too late.
B00097DX3U|4.0|I am a big Soundgarden fan, and I really loved the first Audioslave album.  Regarding this one, there are some good joints on it, but I just can't get over how the first song \\"Your Time Has Come\\" has almost exactly the same riff as the first song on the last album--\\"Cohise\\".  Did they think no one would notice?  I think it's  pretty lame.  The song Your Time Has Come is pretty strong on its own though, and the only real clinker is \\"Heaven's Dead\\" which sounds like one of the many forgetable songs from Temple of the Dog.  Be Yourself is weak too and doesn't really fit the rest of the album, which has a lot of Soundgarden-like rockers.  The Worm and Man or Animal are straight up classic Soundgarden joint.  #1 Zero is kind of power-ballady (slow part, heavy part, repeat).  Drown Me Slowly is a little more Ragey.  A solid album once you get over their copying of the Coshise riff, and the couple weak songs.
0895260131|5.0|This book reveals pretty much everything that most people don't know about Islam.  Historically the Crusades were a response to Islam's expansionism. <br /> <br />It is an easy read, much like the PIGt American History, it provides much of the foundation and basic facts that most people do not know. <br /> <br />Mr Bold, obviously didn't read the book, because if the book was incorrect in any factual way, he would have pointed it out.  Mr. Bold is just having a PC knee jerk. <br /> <br />I would like to point out that the Quran actually commands Muslims to fight. <br /> <br />Such verses as: <br /> <br />Qur'an 9:29 \\"Fight those who do not believe until they all surrender, paying the protective tax in submission.\\"  <br /> <br />Qur'an 8:39 \\"So fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief [non-Muslims]) and all submit to the religion of Allah alone (in the whole world).\\" <br /> <br /> <br />These verses are just a bit of why there will always be Muslim terror.  Anyone who sits down and actually studies the verses will find verses such as the ones above that call for world domination.  This is why nearly 100% of violence in the world is Islamic based. <br /> <br />This includes: <br /> <br />-1 Million Christians murdered in the Sudan. <br />-400 school children in Russia. <br />-Thousands of Christians in Indonesia and E. Timor. <br />-Spain's Bombings <br />-The UK Underground bombings. <br />-9/11 which costed 3,000 lives <br />-US embassy bombings in 2 African nations. <br />-The bombing of the USS Cole. <br />-The murder of Van Gogh's descendant by a Muslim. <br />-The killing of Missionaries in the Phillipines. <br />-The attacks of Muslims in trying to conquer the Phillipines. <br />-The Black Hawk Down Incident. <br />-The violence in Kosovo was from Muslims trying to conquer that nation and turn it to an Islamic State. <br />-Attacks in India by Muslims from Pakistan. <br /> <br />Little known fact:  All Palestinian Suicide bombers are Muslim, but 1/3of the Palestinians population is Christian. <br /> <br />While many would say that this represents only a limited ammount of Muslims, I would suggest reading this verse: <br /> <br />Muslim:C34B20N4668 \\"The Messenger said: `Anybody who equips a warrior going to fight in the Way of Allah is like one who actually fights. And anybody who looks after his family in his absence is also like one who actually fights.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />There is much proof that this it the position that is being taken.  In reference I would suggest reading the book, Infiltration by Paul Sperry.  This is a good follow up book after reading this introduction.  Sperry points out that 8 in 10 Mosques are actually ran by Saudi Arabian extremists either directly or indirectly.  He also points out that nearly all the reading material at these mosques are extreme in their position, including the call for destruction of Israel. <br /> <br />The violence of Islam has been on going since the founding of the religion. <br /> <br />-Mecca was conquered, it didn't convert by choice. <br />-Palestine was Conquered. <br />-Egypt was Conquered and the books in the Libary at Alexandria that was there were burned, except Aristotle, after it rebuilt from the original sad distruction by Christians. <br />-Spain was violently conquered and France was invaded at the beginning of the Middle Ages. <br />-Turkey (which was Muslim) killed a million Armineans. <br />-Yugoslavia was invaded. <br /> <br />This is facts that this book reveals that are not known by the general public. <br /> <br />Another myth exposed is the myth that Islam means Peace, it actually means \\"Submission\\", which I would ask Mr. Bold to reconcile this meaning of Submission with his idea of it only a limited ammount of people twisting their Scripture. <br /> <br />Finally, I strongly suggest this book.  It is an outstanding work for the person who does not enjoy reading heavy books or does not have the time to read a book doctorial work. <br /> <br />If you enjoy this book and decide to read more about the doctrinal topic of this subject, I would suggest: Prophet of Doom by Craig Winn.  You can purchase the book here at Amazon.com or google search for it, since it has been published freely online. <br /> <br />
B000067IZ3|5.0|This movie should make the top ten all time if for no other reason that it contained a number of great actors who no doubt were weighing in on this subject.  The script was very well written and led the viewer from one story to the next connecting them with precision. A really great movie about what no doubt still goes on today.
0201721481|5.0|I really agree with the previous reviewer (Paul M), giving this book 5 stars. this book gives very understandable explanations with examples after each, since as I understood from my practice, it is really hard to imagine what the writer is explaining  about, without practical programming examples. On the other hand, the book is not so verbose, and you don't completely get tired until you understand one thing, saving much of your time.

B0006IIPJ4|5.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a movie that one loves or hates.  The story is a mixture of detective story and science fiction, the kind of story that was made into serials of the 1930's and 40's.  Intrepid newspaper report Polly Perkins (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) is hard after a story that leads her to a mysterious scientist named Totenkopf (or Dead Head).  The Sky Captain of the title is a flying ace named Joe Sullivan (Jude Law) who has the benefit of using space-age technology (from a plane that doubles as a submarine to a ray gun) invented by his sidekick Dex (played by Giovanni Ribisi).  Totenkopf is also quite an inventor and has a fleet of flying robots invade New York early in the film. Of course, Polly Perkins and Joe Sullivan have a past and their arguments make them seem like a married couple.  Angelina Jolie makes a brief appearance as Frankie, who commands a hovering aircraft carrier.  The futuristic inventions give the movie an interesting twist since we don't know what to expect next.<br /><br />The big difference with this film is that it was almost entirely computer generated.  The city streets, cars, buildings etc. were created by computer effects.  If I had not known how it was made I might have guessed that the film had gone through a colorizing process: the colors tend to be shades of grey with washed-out flesh tones.  The eye does become accustomed to the look of the film and the muted colors add much to the overall atmosphere.  All of the CGI effects allowed the file creator Kerry Conan (somebody who truly wore all kinds of hats in this production) to do some fantastic effects.  The opening scenes showing the docking of a German blimp is nicely done and the robot effects were fabulous, particularly the scene where Gwyneth Paltrow is trying to get a picture of the robots and avoid getting stepped on.<br /><br />The DVD extras include an interesting \\"making of\\" feature that included interviews and gave an excellent idea of how the concept of this film was born.  One gets an appreciation of all of the work that went into the effects and the difficulty the actors overcame by having nothing but a blue screen to react to. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow may not be what some critics would call a movie with a message but is pure entertainment, reaching back to old serials and sci-fi movies to make something visually stunning and nicely acted.  It holds your interest much like Raiders of the Lost Ark which has an equally fantastic story and improbabilities.  Just sit back and enjoy.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Even if Miyazaki had only made Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind, his position would be secure as a master.  <br />The film is a lovely summation of his pet themes. Environmentalism, brave girls with noble souls and conflict with few clear \\"bad guys\\" (every group in a miyazaki film will show some shred of nobility). <br />The visuals are perfectly stunning and the best suprises are always a concert of elements, plot + character + visual. <br />I in no way mean to diminsh the film when i say that it obviously represents an early stage product from Miyazki.  <br />This storyline inparticular would be vastly improved upon, without being repeated, a decade later with Prncess Mononoke. A true refinement of a masterpiece cannot diminish the masterpiece. <br />Naussica stands apart from the rest of Ghibli as a perfect distillation of what the studio in general and Miyazaki in particular are capable of. <br />watch this film and if it is your first Ghibli experience then hold on, beacuse we're two decades in and it's only gotten better.
B000683VI4|3.0|I watched this movie because I had heard it's depressive and has a sad ending. I think the movie had okay acting and an even more average starcast. I somehow don't think the actor(Young Ryan) fitted the role of the young man too well. Well yes he had his own character flaws which adds to making him more real but there were a few loopholes here and there. I would think this is a good story with average actors and an uneffective screenplay. I'm not gonna bother with the details but besdies the title of the movie (The Notebook of course) there isn't much that leaves a heart bend. I'm a sucker for emotions and liek movies with great emotional turmoils.<br /><br />The Notebook is a good film if you watch it with your family. You will enjoy it but I'm sorry I watch too many movies in a year to actually swallow one with such a simple base. Please note that during the first hour of the movie I was completely involved. I must say there were very beautiful locations and the camerawork is nothing less than phenomenal. The story could have had more characters but then it's being read out of a book.<br /><br />An underlying motive behind this film is to present the value of time. Time doesn't wait for anyone. Those of us go to heaven, don't wish to die to get there. Similarly, death is the destination we all share.The last scene was well shot and they could have done without the elusive family visit where Rachel meets her forgotten family. It was sad to see an old man cry when Rachel feels to recall who Mr. Hamilton really is.<br /><br />Overall rating - 7/10
B0006J28BO|5.0|How often is a movie sweet without being emberassing? How often does a teenage girl go on a magical journey to a land of talking cats without making the teenage boys in the audience sneer?  At least once that I can think of.  The cat returns is airy and fresh story telling. It is visually inventive, good hearted and ultimately fun. It always stops just at the edge of triggering the primal grimace factor that boys cultivate listening to stories about princesses. A reaction that we learn to disguise as something more sophisticated but remains little more than a fear of getting cooties.  This is pleasent sophisticated fluff.
B00003CXWV|4.0|When I think of Ray Liotta,I  think of the smiling Henry from Goodfellas. I think of a guy with a life full of youth no matter how old he is. In Blow, Liotta plays father to a kid (Johnny Depp) \\"George\\" and husband to a nagging wife. Liotta played his character with a lot of conviction. It was sad to see an old man listening to a tape recorded by his son. It was also sad to see him play his role as well as he did. To his son, he's the strongest man on earth. His character was extremely well painted & I don't think they could have possibly done any more justice to him.<br /><br />When I would think of Depp, I would think of Edwards Scissorhands.He plays George in this movie and almost every scene in Blow revolves around him. I must say I liked his introduction to the film.This movie is about a kid who grows up watching his mom leave his dad every now and then. They would quarell over money matters and he wished at that time he never was like them. He also decides to never be poor no matter what may come his way.<br /><br />I never thought Penelope Cruz (was almost in love with her) could play the role of a whiny wife as well as she did in Blow. She was good as she managed to make me grind my teeth each time she spoke harshly to George Jung in the prison. I also liked the fiance stealing scenes.<br /><br />Some of the high points of the movie came towards the end. Most films like to conclude with an endnig of dire sorts. Blow has a tragic yet believable ending. Depp became what he hates and it's quite amusing to see him realise at the same time he's lived the life of a man who's ambitions exceed his talent. Yes,I thought the film was about Cocaine but no! it's about the wrong steps a man takes in his life.Another heartbreaking scene was Depp acknowledging the fact that his dad (Liotta) was always right at the age of 42. Money is nothing.<br /><br />Pardon me for the random takes but it's not easy writing a review for Blow. It made me smile and it made me sad but on the whole it was a bit of a lesson in it's own way. Blow had a good ending(appropriate)I would recommend Blow to everyone who doesn't like over mushy endings and for those to whom reality matters.<br /><br />Excellent direction and good screenplay.<br /><br />Enjoy whatever works for you,reader.<br /><br />PS - Wonder what doing blow actually feels like :Pbut on the whole it was a bit of a lesson in it's own way. Blow had a good ending(appropriate)I would recommend Blow to everyone who doesn't like over mushy endings and for those to whom reality matters. <br /> <br />Excellent direction and good screenplay. <br />Enjoy whatever works for you,reader. <br /> <br />PS - Wonder what doing blow actually feels like :P
B00005JNTX|5.0|I am so proud of Robert Rodriguez and Quinten Tarnitino for making sure their movies get widescreen only releases. They want everyone to see the movie the way it was supposed to be seen and not this garbage full screen versions that exist. Other than that, this movie is fantastic and everything a comic book movie should be. You say it is too gory? It is rated R for a reason and if you were to read the comics, they are exactly the same way. Fantastic movie, and if you don't get it because it is widescreen...you are a fool and uneducated about movies. Widescreen should be the only format and everyone else should cry themselves to sleep.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Alright ladies and gentlemen, I am gonna give you the real deal with this album, after reading all 816 reviews fro this album (that was the number as of 7/28/05 6:35am EST) I have to say there is ALOT of people hateing on this album.  I cant stress enough DONT believe their lies.  Thats right I called them lies.  I have been in the music industry for the last 3 years (produceing mostly) and I have to say this album is for the lack of a better word, Gorgeous.  It is very much art and one of the best albums that has come out in a rather long time.  Sure you can compare them to U2 or Radiohead, if your a jacka**.  Of course they sound a bit alike since they are from across the pond, other than that, Coldplay unique.  Ok so to get to the point if you read this and if your even considering buying this album shell out the cash, and buy it.  You wont be disapointed
0743216385|5.0|This is the famous story of Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division.  What makes this book so special is that it isn't a dry, technical account of military action.  It is the personal story of a group of very special men.  It will make you appreciate what all WWII combat vets went through to defend our world.  An inspiring tale of sacrifice, friendship, & brotherhood.
B0009K7QZ8|3.0|I love soaps and what I loved about the first season (except maybe the last few episodes) the show never took itself too seriously and often joked about itself but the second season got a bit out of control with the winks and nods and stopped being fun. Instead we get Seth whining all season and talking so fast that he sounded like a patient on litium. Marissa became a joke not only because of the way the character was written but because of the actress playing her. The only thing constructive that they gave the adults to do is ponder possible affairs and all the new cast members were there  strickly to walk all over and were gone by the end of the year. Especially disappointing was the Lesbian story between a major character that made it look like after a few episodes (and Sweeps) she was cured and went back to a male. Puhleez!<br />Don't get me wrong, there were some amusing parts like anything with Julie or Caleb but not enough to purchase the whole season like I did with Season 1. Hopefully Josh Shwartz and Mc G get their act together especially with the powerful competition going up against it on Thursday nights this fall.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin's second album was definatly one of their best. Of course you have the classic Page riffs that you will get on every album on songs such as the open title \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and the sweet riff and one of my favorite zeppelin solo's on the track \\"Heartbraker\\". But what I don't like is how much John Paul Jones bass work on the first two albums especially this one is overlooked. On songs like \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\" and my favorite title on the album \\"Ramble On\\" his work is essential to the songs with great fills and sweet lines. But even more then those two, people overlook the great bass lines on the blues medely \\"The Lemon Song\\". It is Jones best work. Bonzo also had a great album especially with the ending song and probably his most famous, \\"Moby Dick\\". This album is a great second album with some of zeppelin's biggest hits.

B00005CCA9|5.0|I am always a little hesitant about posting reviews of classical works.  Ironically--although I cut my teeth on rock'n'roll and folk--I find that I mostly listen to classical music these days.  My ex-wife used to have it on all the time, and one day, it seemed, I suddenly realized that I could really HEAR it and understand what was going on.  Even if I lacked the vocabulary to describe it, on some level, I comprehended it.  (A mini-miracle after almost having failed \\"Music Appreciation\\" in college:  just because, on one exam, I cited \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\" as an example of a \\"cantata.\\")    But serioiusly, I live in a region that it still lucky enough to have 24 hour classical music on public radio.  It has been an education in itself. I'm so grateful for it and have become an avid supporter. (BTW WMHT in Schenectady, NY is now available online as a webcast, so if you're living in an area that is underserved, try tuning them in.)    But one thing I have noticed--even after all the fuss over Rachmaninoff a few years back due to the use of the Rach 3 in the film SHINE--there is relatively little Rachmaninoff on my local NPR station.  It seems like such an obvious choice.  This recording in particular, since it seems like every second piano piece they play is by Martha Argerich.    Reading over someof the reviews posted below, I can well understand why some critics find Argerich's performance to be definitive...and also why others dispute that assertion.  I don't want to be wishy-washy here, but as a babe in the classical woods, I cannot help but be overwhelmed by Argerich's virtuosity.  But I can also understand why some might find it too flashy.  One of the beautiful things about classical music though--I am discovering--is that there is much more room for interpretation than I had ever imagined.  Does there need to be a definitive version?  Listening to the Argerich/Freire/Chailly collaboration has only made me more curious to hear others.      This could be the start of something big.
B0000541AM|5.0|I'm 23 and just watched this killer movie for the first time last week on TV and I have to say I was glued to the screen until the very end.The most surprising part is that out of all my friends young and old nobody has ever told me about this movie.I have some cool news for any of you guys or gals out there who dont mind a good video game here and there, the infamous Rockstar ( makers of the Grand theft auto games) is making a warriors game!!! hell ya.Your basicly playing the movie wich sounds bad ass to me.You can check out a few video clips and screenshots at [...] .The game is due out in October around the same time as the collectors edition DVD.Now the game is still in early development but when you see the shots you know its the warriors baby.Come out and playyyyyyaa!
B00004RF9B|5.0|This is a wonderful sci fi classic that has set the bar for every sci fi adventure film that has come out since and those still to come.
B00006ADD5|5.0|Of all the movies that really don't need another review, this one probably heads the list. However since 'Lawrence of Arabia' is one of my all-time top ten films I wanted to add my two cents anyway.<br /><br />Seldom in cinematic history has there ever been so grand a tale told as the story of T. E. Lawrence and his miraculous accomplishments in the deserts of Arabia. A man of truly mythic proportions whose interior vision was so powerful it forever changed the course of world politics. By an act of pure, concentrated willpower (\\"Nothing is written unless I write it\\") Lawrence defied all the odds and experts, uniting the ever-feuding semitic tribes of the Middle East under one flag in a battle for Arab independence. This was a daring project to commit to film and it paid of, becoming one of the most honored and studied films of all-time.<br /><br />Columbia pulled out all the stops in bringing this true life adventure to the screen. Nothing but the best was required. Director David Lean, complimented by one of the most skilled casts ever assembled; Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains, Arthur Kennedy, Jack Hawkins and Jose Ferrer brought the story to life as nobody else could. Coupled with Maurice Jarre's epic soundtrack, we have been graced with as perfect a film as you will ever see.
B0000A118M|5.0|This is one of the best flowing, most organic, beautiful and emotional pieces of music I've ever heard. Also keep in mind that this is coming from someone who owns barely any jazz records. You don't need to be some sort of jazz expert to recognize how truly amazing A Love Supreme is. Coltrane pours his heart out and then some. Essential for any music fan.
0385338686|4.0|OK, I have been hard on Sophie Kinsella's \\"Shopaholic\\" books. To the point where I vowed never to buy them again.<br /><br />But, I caved in with Undomestic Goddess (yes, I know its not a Shopaholic one) because the storyline sounded corny, but good.<br /><br />I am glad that I did.  While Kinsella, in my opinion, has a habit of going way over the top with both her characters personalities and the situation she puts them in, this book was truly fun to read.<br /><br />I think what really helped this book was the fact that,unlike Becky in Shopaholic, our main character is a strong, lead person who has a life of her own.  Who does not expect to go along her merry little way and have everyone around her just gravitate naturally to her - despite her obvious character flaws.<br /><br />The storyline is actually interesting and kept me wanting to know more about our main character.<br /><br />Of course, once Samantha goes through her \\"office\\" phase, the storyline gets extremely corny and hard to swallow, but somehow, in this instance, the author pulled it off for me.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The STAR WARS DVD Trilogy is super!  The films are better improved, and the picture is magnificent!  The colors and tones are bolder and stronger than ever before.  I loved these films and still do.  I still think EMPIRE is the best of the bunch, but all of these films are fun to watch again.  And now that they are on DVD (Finally!), they are even more fun to watch.
0767812387|4.0|I loved this movie! I thought Vanessa Williams looked stunning as the jaded dance instructor who had sworn off men till an incredibly handsome new custodian walks into the studio and straight into her heart. The custodian is played wonderfully by newcomer (as an actor that is) chayanne. His kind, shy, boyish portrayal is engaging and likable and a joy to watch. Likewise almost all the supporting roles are well done. So why only four stars? You'll notice I said \\"almost\\" all the supporting roles were well done. There are two reasons. Kris Kristofferson (for the most part) and Joan Plowright. We'll start with Kristofferson who is badly miscast here. So much so that his crusty, surly, out of character portrayal nearly ruins the mood. At least everytime he's on camera. He's just plain awful. Maybe even embarrassing here. I never thought much of him as an actor and after seeing this movie I thought even less of him. Then there's Joan Plowright who is supposedly a great actress right? Wrong! Would a great actress overact the way she does here? What was she thinking. Better still why didn't the director do his job and bring her in line. I think sometimes these people become legends in their own minds and it rubs off on those around them and they think \\"she must be good.....who am I to tell her she's off\\"! Well anyway the movie works in spite of them. There's one very memorable scene where Williams almost dances out of her dress that will have men drooling. It's a very very hot scene. Look I hate to dance but just give me Vanessa Williams in a nurses outfit that is falling off and I'll be the first one on the dance floor doing a very bad John Travolta immitation! Great music, great dancing, georgeous leads, aw heck.....what else do you need.....buy it today!

B00000DGUY|4.0|During the 1985 Live Aid concert, it gave an opportunity for many bands that had established a cult following to come out and play on the world stage.   Perhaps one band that benefited from this more than any other band was Dire Straits.   Dire Straits' live performance of \\"Money for Nothing\\" and \\"Sultans of Swing\\" clearly elevated the band to superstar status.    It was also the momentum from Live Aid that propelled \\"Money For Nothing\\" to #1 song status and the album \\"Brothers in Arms\\" to #1 album status.    If you look beyond \\"Money For Nothing\\" and \\"Brothers in Arms\\", you will discover what a terrific band Dire Straits is.   Much of Dire Straits is the result of the awesome guitar work of Mark Knopfler, but there is also some great instrumentation from other band members such as Mark's brother David and bassist John Illsley..  In many circles, Knopfler is considered as good as they come.   For Dire Straits, they would do things much differently than many of the other bands during the \\"British Invasion\\" that was taking place.   In an era where Punk and New Wave were taking center stage, Dire Straits were doing things the old-fashioned way:  a combination of Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and even some Country.     Knopfler has also proven himself to be a top notch lyricist - writing both humorous and serious songs.  The combination of outstanding instrumentation, great lyrics and a mix of old-fashioned Rock genres is really what made Dire Straits such a great band.    A great compilation of their music over a 15 year period is captured on \\"Sultans of Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits\\". <br /> <br />There is one problem with this collection and it prevents this from being a perfect collection.   The problem is that radio-edit versions of songs are included on this collection.   I happen to have no use for radio-edits of songs.   I think it is horrible that musicians are pressured to reduce the lengths of songs just to hear them on the radio.   There hasn't been a radio-edit version of any song by any group that is better than the album cut.   Perhaps one of the worst radio-edits ever done is \\"Money for Nothing\\" by Dire Straits.    The appeal of \\"Money For Nothing\\" is on the beginning and end - namely Sting's intro of \\"I Want My MTV\\" and Knopfler and Sting's closing duet of \\"I Want My MTV\\".   Sadly, the radio-edit of \\"Money For Nothing\\" eliminates these two key components - and sadly \\"Sultans of Swing\\" includes this radio-edit.   I find it very disappointing and I feel is a be detriment to this collection since this is for all practical purposes the most successful song by Dire Straits, thus it deserves better on a compilation. <br /> <br />The studio albums from Dire Straits career are well represented - although there was an emphasis on the later material.  The albums are:  \\"Dire Straits\\" (\\"Sultans of Swing\\"), \\"Communique\\" (\\"Lady Writer\\"); \\"Making Movies\\" (\\"Romeo and Juliet\\", \\"Tunnel of Love\\"); \\"Love Over Gold\\" (\\"Private Investigations\\"); \\"ExtendedancEPlay\\" (\\"Twisting By the Pool\\"); \\"Alchemy\\" (live cut of \\"Love Over Gold\\"); \\"Brothers in Arms\\" (\\"So Far Away\\", \\"Money For Nothing\\", \\"Brothers in Arms\\", \\"Walk of Life\\"); \\"On Every Street\\" (\\"Calling Elvis\\", \\"Heavy Fuel\\", and \\"On Every Street\\").   There are also two cuts from the \\"On the Night\\" 1993 concert - \\"Your Latest Trick\\" and \\"Local Hero/Wild Theme\\" (the latter song was not found on the \\"On the Night\\" CD, but was found on the DVD).   Perhaps the most disappointing omission from this collection is \\"Telegraph Road\\" - this is a song from the \\"Love Over Gold\\" album.   You can also make the argument that more than two songs from \\"Making Movies\\" should have been represented. <br /> <br />When looking at compilations, there is one other significant Greatest Hits compilation from Dire Straits - \\"Money For Nothing\\".   This is an older compilation - and a less comprehensive one.    It does include four songs that are not found on the \\"Sultans of Swing\\" compilation.  These songs are: \\"Down to the Waterline\\", \\"Where Do You Think You're Going\\", \\"Portobello Belle\\", and \\"Telegraph Road\\" - the latter two are live cuts.   Songs that are on \\"Sultans of Swing\\" that are not found on \\"Money for Nothing\\" are \\"Lady Writer\\", \\"So Far Away\\", the tracks from \\"On Every Street\\", and the live cuts. <br /> <br />There is one thing that \\"Sultans of Swing\\" does very well and that is in the ordering.  One thing I like is when a Greatest Hits compilation orders the tracks in chronological order.   This allows me to see how the band has progressed over time.   The nice thing is that \\"Sultans of Swing\\" does this.  In particular, they arrange the tracks in the order that they were released on the album that they are from.   The liner notes reference how Dire Straits progressed from a band that had a very \\"live\\" sound in their early days to a band that began to really understand how to utilize a music studio to your advantage.   This is something that is evident on the \\"Sultans of Swing\\" collection. <br /> <br />One thing that is also very good is that this is a very good mastered collection.   This CD is High Definition Compatible Digital (HDCD) and it is very evident on the tracks.   The \\"Sultans of Swing\\" compilation is one of the highest quality recorded CDs I have ever heard.   The sounds almost sound three dimensional - especially the instrumentation. <br /> <br />The liner notes contain a terrific (but brief) write-up by Robert Sandall that puts the band in the proper musical prospective.   The songwriting and copyright credits are listed for each of the tracks.  The musicians and producers are listed, but as a group and not by track.   I would have also liked to have seen the album titles listed for each of the tracks.  Overall, this is a terrific collection, but the inclusion of the radio-edits prevents this being a 5 star collection - still it is one I would recommend.
B000002J09|4.0|This album is a decent album.  I personally think Black Dog, Rock n' Roll, and When the Levee Breaks are great songs.  Stairway is a good song too, but i've never been one to fully appreciate ballads.  This album deserves to be in a classic rock cd collection, but it probably doesn't deserve 5 stars.    I would, however like to also comment on everyone else's comments, and how inane a great majority of them are.  People are rating this album based on their opinions of the band itself, and not the album.  Or they're rating this album based on their opinions of the fans of Led Zeppelin, and not the album.  It doesn't take much mental power to realize that this is an album review.  Try to stick to the subject.      Now I'd like to highlight some of the dumber things i've read:    \\"Led Zepplelin are really primarily a pop group.They don't have half the anger or ferocity of many other bands.\\"  -  Apparently this person's very limited emotional scale and music appreciation and background limits their perception of rock to only those very angry and ferocious artists.    \\"I don't think Led Zeppelin has a troo future making music. They come nowhere close to the unbelievably fresh sounds of Nickelback, Limp Bizkit (step off Fred Durst), Staind, Puddle of Mudd, and the awesome Default.\\"  -  This was a good one, because it sounds like the person doesn't realize that Led Zeppelin had a career, and it also sounds like they weren't aware that their career was 30 years ago.  Why doesn't it sound as fresh as music released yesterday?  Cause it was recorded 1/3 of a century ago.  Congratulations.    \\" Jimmy Page's solos are okay, but he's no Avril Lavigne - now there's some solos!\\"  -  Admittedly, I haven't listened to Avril Lavigne much, but I don't hear too many people talking about her kicking solos.        For the last part of my review, I'd like to comment on the people who like to attack \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" with the escapegoat-ism that it was ripped off from \\"Taurus\\" by Spirit.  After reading those reviews, I promptly listened to \\"Taurus\\" by Spirit... mainly because I like to know these sort of things.  Despite the fact that \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is a much longer song, (\\"Taurus\\" is under 3 minutes), people still claim that the song is a direct rip off.  \\"Stairway\\" has many different movements to the song, and only one movement sounds even anywhere similar to the STYLE of \\"Taurus\\".  Within that movement, I counted EXACTLY THREE notes in succession that were the same.  Oddly enough, these three notes are what's called a minor arpeggio in musical terms.  Not exactly something you can copyright as it is a modal function of a musical scale.  But hey!  Whatever makes you feel better at night.    Now, I didn't make comments on a lot of negative reviews, because I don't particularly care wether you do or do not like L.Z.  But, if you're going to write a negative review, do it with some class.  If you have no class, do it with intelligence.  If you have no intelligence, do it with some simple logic.  If you don't have simple logic, DON'T WRITE A REVIEW.      Thank you,  that is all.
B00006AUIG|3.0|Well I thought Session 9 was pretty good; I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if that option were available.  Liking movies that are more psychologically scary rather than gory, I'd say there were a few scenes in this movie that were very frightening.  Unfortunately there was some gratuitous gore that I felt shifted the mood of the film a bit from atmospheric terror to slasher movie. <br />I felt the cinematography and sound editing was excellent, and is worth watching for that alone. <br />I suppose you could say that the effectiveness of a movie can be measured by how long it stays with you after you've finished watching it.  I definitely thought about this movie for a while after I had seen it.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I watched this film in theaters; it was magical and Johnny delivered a masterful performance. And of course, Kate Winslet is a genius at acting. I found myself completely engrossed in the plot, which is very poignant and beautiful. The ending made me cry...
B00005UEAR|5.0|This is one of my favorites by Dream Theater for the reason that it shows so much of Dream Theater in one album. Songs like \\"Solitary Shell\\" show their pop-inspired nature, songs like \\"War Inside My Head\\" show their meaner side, and songs like \\"Goodnight Kiss\\" get really emotional. Overall, an excellent album. <br /> <br />Disc 1: <br /> <br />\\"The Glass Prison\\" is a hard-hitting track, one of DT's most famous for sure. A tad too long, but has great solos. 8/10 <br /> <br />\\"Blind Faith\\" some claim to have an out-of-place chorus, but I think the song overall flows musically. A great track. 9/10 <br /> <br />\\"Misunderstood\\" is a track I think would have been better if it was half as long. It gets boring after a while. 5/10 <br /> <br />\\"The Great Debate\\" conveys the topic of stem cells in a powerful way. Has real-life samples and really builds up nicely. 8/10 <br /> <br />\\"Disappear\\" is not one of my favorite tracks as it contains way too many filters and electronic weirdness for me to like it too much. The \\"Live At Budokan\\" version is much better. 6/10 <br /> <br />Disc 2: <br /> <br />I. Overature - This song is one of DT's most musical instrumentals. Certainly has its moments and like all overatures, outlines what is to come. 9/10 <br /> <br />II. About to Crash - Overature flows perfectly into this track, such that it's almost impossible to listen to either by themselves. An excellent track conveying both manic and depressive states musically. 9/10 <br /> <br />III. War Inside My Head - A perfectly done track which has a really mean riff to it and a powerful sound. It's so short, they didn't have the time to do anything wrong. 10/10 <br /> <br />IV. The Test That Stumped Them All - starts off with an absolutely crazy piano and keyboard riff and goes into more powerful stuff. The lyrics in this song unfortunately suck. <br /> <br />V. Goodnight Kiss - a very emotional song that includes mediocre singing and one of the best guitar solos you've ever heard. 7/10 <br/> <br />VI. Solitary Shell - a very pop-inspired tune that has a very nice melody. <br /> <br />VII. About To Crash Reprise - This takes the original and gives it even more impact which fades away slightly in some parts but builds up to the following track. 8/10 <br /> <br />VIII. Losing Time/Grand Finale - Dream Theater's best closing song ever in my opinon. Really has a grandiose feel to it and will knock your socks off on the right sound equipment. 11/10, if there is such a thing. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this album enough to any Dream Theater aquiaintance or fan, but if you're a first-timer, I would check out \\"Awake\\" or \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" first.
B00005A0N5|5.0|When i first heard \\"i wish i had an angel\\" by nightwish i was fascinated.  The mixture of heavy metal and operatic female singing was uniquely satisfying.   <br /> <br />This album is just gorgeous.  The instruments are all well played, particularly the guitar work.  There are even a few guitar solos from time to time, which are quite satisfying- and unlike older guitar solos from (with all do respect) metallica, for example, they carry on the cool, feminine feeling the entire album sails on.  The music is, well, night-oriented.  Nightwish is perhaps something that metal fans and goth fans can agree upon as excellent. <br /> <br />Without a doubt, though, Tarja's vocals are transcendent.  Her finnish accent only adds to the fantasy-feeling.  Its like being in another world, song after song.  And after hearing the wonderful \\"walking in the air\\", you get hit by the secret track.  It is hauntingly mesmerizing.  An end to the wonderful, wonderful proof that yes, metal lives.

B00006CXXU|5.0|This is my favorite CD, which I've had for nearly three years, since it came out. I love it so much that when a couple of tracks started to skip, I had to buy a new one (which I hardly ever do). Christina's vocals are amazing, the lyrics are heartfelt and beautiful, and she creates some of the best pop music I've heard.  <br /> <br />What I love most about this cd is the versatility it shows. Song styles vary from club (Dirrty), to inspirational power ballad (Beautiful, Soar), to rock (Make Over, Fighter), to hip-hop (Can't Hold Us Down), to R&B (Impossible, Loving Me 4 Me), to funk (Underappreciated). My favorite song, possibly ever, is the second song on the cd, Walk Away. It's a beautiul, emotional, haunting song about the burn of heartache, done in a more traditional blues/soul/jazz style that Aguilera is continuing to experiment with on her upcoming cd.  <br /> <br />To Douglas Taylor: <br />I can love this album because it's genuine, artistic, experimental, and because I like pop music (which you obviously don't). Why did you buy this cd and \\"pretend to like her\\" if you so obviously hate this style of music? I won't pretend that I know any of the artists you reference (though I've heard of John Carpenter), but I would guess that I wouldn't be a fan of the style of music. Also, I'd like to let you know that I am not \\"delusional and weak.\\" Instead of resenting an artist because you feel you need to pretend to like them (?!?), why don't you just stop listening, and stop insulting. Thanks! :D
0385512104|5.0|The \\"author\\"/narrator of this story is Christopher Boone, a 15-year-old autistic boy who is hyper-logical and has a great degree of difficulty understanding emotions.  Haddon's style of prose never once steps outside Christopher's voice; the book is not exploitative or condescending regarding the narrator's autism.  Instead, it feels extremely realistic; I haven't read a book in quite a long time that has such a unique \\"voice\\".  There's a lot of humor in the book, though nothing that's at the expense of Christopher.  By the end of the novel, it's impossible to view the autistic character as \\"other\\" in any way; everything is filtered through his brain and it becomes easy to identify with his thoughts.  The \\"mystery\\" of the novel is both disturbing and sad (though I will admit I saw both surprises coming), and almost more so when you realize how difficult it is for Christopher to comprehend the magnitude of the dysfunction in his own family.  The characters of his parents are at once realistic and very sympathetic; despite the challenge and occasional frustration at raising an autistic child, both parents are very loving towards their only child, who cannot fully reciprocate their love.   <br />This book is an amazingly quick read.  Highly recommended! <br />

0812550757|5.0|I admit that I went into this book hoping for something as equally great as the first book in this saga, Ender's Game.  The book was different from the first but just as good.  Ender is in his mid-30's in this book and has changed some of his childish attitudes that were evident in the first book.  He is now an unstoppable force for truth.  Read this book if you want a good story.  I recommend reading Ender's Game first though.
B0000039PW|5.0|I'm not going to type some long ass thing about this cd. Every1 knows biggie is grreat this cd is always regarded as a classic . Definently need to have this .
B000024D4R|5.0|First off, I recommend this album only if you liked \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". If you are not familiar with satirical lyrics of Pink Floyd, you might not like this album. \\"Animals\\" is like a mini version of George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\". In \\"Animals, Roger Water classifies society into three groups: Pigs, greedy corporate businessmen who stop at nothing for success; Dogs, who are usually politicians that are afraid on the inside, they seek protection in \\"Pigs,\\" who mold them into self centered individuals that will never admit they are wrong; and finally Sheep, The mindless masses that wonder through the lands.<br /><br />\\"Animals\\" really shows Roger Water's deep left wing side. It also shows some of David Gilmore's skill with the guitar. In the song \\"Dogs\\", Gilmore is able to create a dog like barking sound with his guitar as well as make pig sounds in the song \\"Pigs (Three Different Kinds). If you just listen to the album and put it away, you might not like it. If you take time and carefully listen to and interpret Water's lyrics, you will truly enjoy this album. It is a must buy for any true Pink Floyd Fan.<br /><br />Oh yes, please ignore the comments made by ignorant people insulting this albumand it's integrity, it's obvious they have too much time on their hands and want to waste yours. *coughkidsreviewdudecough*  ;)
0385495323|5.0|This is a book that is easy to read and follow. <br />It is filled with both historical facts and formal explanation. <br />Not for set theory hungry crowd.
B00004Z459|4.0|When I first got \\"Hybrid Theory\\", I was really disappointed. There were only two songs on there that I really liked. As I listened to it more, I started to like it more and more. The Album is a great fusion of Hard Rock, Hip-Hop, Techno and Rap, combining all these music styles into one great album.<br /><br />Now I'm a big fan of Classic Rock, bands like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Who, The Beatles, etc. but I really enjoyed this album. It was unique:  It had lyrics that reached out to you; Hard Rock Riffs that made you shake your head back and forth; a catchy electronic/hip hop based rhythm.<br /><br />I recommend this album to anyone who likes Alternative Rock and Metal/Rap music. However, I'm sure even if you don't like alternative metal or rap you might still like this album since it has any different styles in it.
0156027321|5.0|I found this book intruiging, and I particularly liked the delightfully ambiguous ending.  HOWEVER, I have learned that in 1981, the Brazillian author Moacyr Scliar wrote a novel in which a boy is stranded on a lifeboat with a jaguar after the boat his is on, containing a managerie, sinks.  Was Yann Martel aware of this novel?  If so, he did not attribute any aspect of his story idea to Scliar.

B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I saw this movie when I was a kid and I really liked it. It is one of the best movies ever about blues legends (Robert Johnson) and of course the music, arrangments and Steve Vai playing makes it much more interesting. All the \\"Delta\\" style blues of Ry Cooder is great too, the shooting in Louisiana and all the colors and landscaping make you feel in the old blues cradle. I highly recomend it.

B00000JLWW|1.0|To this day, I will never understand why this film is what it is. It perplexes me to this day why this film is the most successful film in history, and boggles the mind even more that it did win Best Picture. That was hype at its worst. If \\"Titanic\\" hasn't been so successful at the box office, the award surely would have gone to either \\"As Good As It Gets\\" or \\"Good Will Hunting\\".<br /><br />I'm not going to bore you with the details of the plot. I will say that \\"Titanic\\" is the most overrated movie in history. It's hard to believe that James Cameron, who directed such excellent movies as \\"The Terminator\\", \\"The Abyss\\", \\"T2\\" and \\"True Lies\\", made this film. Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't that great as an actor and was still a full blown teen idol. He has since improved (he was excellent as Howard Hughes in \\"The Aviator\\"), but he isn't great here, nor is Kate Winslet. Kathy Bates was wasted in her role, a sad thing for such a fine actress. Bill Paxton could do better, and Billy Zane isn't too great, either. The film's heart and soul is Gloria Stuart, who deserved an award for brilliant performance.<br /><br />I really cannot think of anything elese to say about this mess, but I'll just say that this film isn't as great as box office and awards all say.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This is a wonderful greatest hits album. All the songs are great and it is nice having them all in one place with the addition of new just as great songs. I couldn't be happier with this.
B000002JS6|5.0|When it was announced that AC/DC was to forge on without the late, great Bon Scott, many fans of the group were angered at the band for making such a risky move. It didn't help when it was announced that Scott's replacement was Brian Jones, who had previously been a member of Geordie. Jones differed greatly from Scott, as he was less theatrical and had no tatoos, the things that made Scott Scott. But when \\"Black In Black\\" was released in 1981, all fans were proven wrong, as the album became their most successful release ever and is currently the fifth best selling album in the world, with 19,000,000 copies and counting sold.<br /><br />From the tolling bells of \\"Hell's Bells\\" to the last chord of \\"Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\", it is clear that AC/DC had lost none of their fire, only their lesd singer. And while were on that subject, Brian Jones was excellent on here. Scott may have been a beter performer (think David Lee Roth vs. Sammy Hagar), but Jones was a great performer and a great singer. Not that Scott was bad, but Jones' voice was just better. Angus, Malcum, Phil and Cliff all still play like madmen, and their songs rock out. This cd contains the classics like \\"Back In Black\\", \\"Givin The Dog A Bone\\", \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" and my favorite AC/DC song ever, \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\". That latter song still rocks.<br /><br />In conclusion, \\"Back In Black\\" is an album that belongs in anyone's cd collection. Buy it as soon as possible.
B000929AJQ|1.0|I absolute love Nine Inch Nails, I own every album, ep, and single. I listened to the Fragile over and over. When I was in High School I snuck Trent's work from the Quake Soundtrack into our production of MacBeth and used the Fragile for testing the sound system in the auditorium. When this album was released I was overjoyed to listen to it for the first time... at least until it started playing. The real deep emotion just seems to be gone and replaced with an attempt by a well-adjusted weight-lifting energy-drink-consuming Trent. The songs are uninspired and don't carry the dark sexy vibe that I loved. Ghrol is a brilliant Drummer and the melodies are still Trent, but the overwhelming feel is lacking. I miss the dark drug-shooting disfunctional secretive funeral-home-dwelling Trent that produced Downward Spiral and The Fragile. My biggest complaint was he seemed to revert to expression through noise on some tracks instead of the complicated layerings of the Fragile.
B0001KU93C|3.0|Sorry to write this, but Sergio Corbucci's Django is neither as great or as bad as noted by some of these reviewers. I'd have to rank it just a notch below Leone's \\"A Fist Full of Dollars\\" and nowhere close to Leone's other masterpieces (For a Few Dollars More, The Good The Bad and The Ugly, and Once Upon A Time in the West). This is mostly because it lacks the timeless qualities that the Leone classics have maintained over the decades..an atmospheric grittiness and realism that few films, western of otherwise have  been able to achieve.  <br />Django is purhaps a slightly better than a average film. What has probably made it a cult classic is the violence in it that was shocking to film goers in the mid 1960's.  <br />The first time I viewed Django, I was a little disappointed. But I the next time I viewed it, I made a point to look at it by transporting myself to a 1960's mindset.  <br />Looking at the film this way made me see why this movie has been such a cult favorite. But it lacks the appeal to go beyond that. <br />If it did, it would most certainly be right up there with the Leone epics. but it falls far short...at least for me. <br />The detractors of Django are most likely looking at it with at least from a present day view point. From this view point the film may look like a jumbled unrealistic mess. You would be a lot less likely to get the same opinions from any of the Leone films. <br />One reviewer claimed Django mows down 100 or so bad guys with a machine gun that is neither cooled or reloaded, then he complains that they should have attacked at all directions. First Django only himself kills a few dozen or so with this weapon. And since neither guerilla not terrorist tactics were not perfected in those days, why would a few dozen men feel the need to sneak up a a lone gunman who they believe they out number. <br />The scene itself is realistic enough considering the exploits of Stallone's Rambo and Swarzenegger's antics. <br />Django is entertaining. But it doesn't quite hold up as a timeless masterpiece.
B0006L16N8|5.0|this is this band's masterpiece....SO FAR.  lyrics are thought provoking.  musically, it's stunning.  it soars.  can they get any better than this?  it's hard to imagine, but with this effort, it's possible.   <br />coldplay is the U2 of their generation.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|From the other source, this film had a relatively low review, but I think it is a good film.<br /><br />What this film makes great is the great story. I have not read the book, but I am sure it is as good as this film or even better.<br /><br />The story itself is very sad but written so beautifully that its beauty can over-ride the sadness. The past scenes and present ones appear quite often in the way that reveal and unwind the secret. It is a drama, but I think this is more than that. It is a literature -  a work of art... I am talking about the story now.<br /><br />I am happy with the music and photography of the film. Also I find the acting great. The voice of Coleman's young lover sounded like it was always directly from a microphone, and I like the effect because it suites the way she speaks and also describes how this lady's existance sinks into Coleman's mind as though she was a nutrition he was missing so long.<br /><br />The story is a miserable one, but which great literature does not contain a misery anyway?
0393035158|5.0|This is the book that I thought I would never see. This is the book that I would have written were I to have written a book. This is the book which finally lays bare the ridiculous nature of not only baseless faith but moreover the taboo of stating publicly that when it comes to religion, the emperor has no clothes.  <br /> <br />There is little more absurd on this planet than religion and its dogma, when looked at from an uninvolved perspective. The idea that you are eating the body of Jesus in the form of a cracker during communion, the thought that sexually repressed Muslims might be rewarded for mass slaughter with a harem of virgins, these are equivalent in their absurdity, if not in which of them presently resides in the darkest age. <br /> <br /> <br />The religious bulk of America (and the world at large) would find this a sacrilegious and blasphemous book. I can give it no higher praise than that. <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|Believe it or not, before \\"American Idiot\\", I never listened to Green Day at all. It wasn't because I didn't like their music, I had just never really heard them (I know, pretty sad). But now, I am a huge fan and I have a lot of their music, and this is the album that changed it all. Here's a quick track-by-track review: <br /> <br />1. American Idiot - Pretty good, not my favorite though. <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia - I love Jesus of Suburbia, City of the Damned, and Dearly Beloved, but I don't really like the rest. <br />3. Holiday - Awesome song, my second favorite. <br />4. Boulevard of Breken Dreams - Best Green Day song ever made. Period. <br />5. Are We The Waiting - Bit of a different song, still good though. <br />6. St. Jimmy - Reminds me of older Green Day. I like it. <br />7. Give Me Novacaine - Another really good song. <br />8. She's A Rebel - Short, but a great song. <br />9. Extraordinary Girl - This song's all right. I like the chorus. <br />10. Letterbomb - I don't know. It's kinda just there. Ok song. <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends - I really like this song. It's serious and has a real meaning. <br />12. Homecoming - Not as good as Jesus of Suburbia, but has some good parts. Rock & Roll Girlfriend is interesting. <br />13. Whatsername - The beginning is a bit slow, but when it gets heavier I like it.
0156027321|5.0|This heart wrenching book will move you.  It's a little slow in the beginning, but stick with it until you find Pi in the Pacific Ocean and you can't put it down.  Near the end you are faced with an ultimate question.  You decide!

1400031087|5.0|I think this is the best book I have ever read.  My heart would pound with the authors, written so realistic and hit home with me.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I laughed at the corney lines, costumes and primitive technology. My son (6) enjoyed finally seeing the beginning of the end of the series.
006092988X|5.0|I First read this book when I was about 10 years old and was deeply affected by it. Now,as an adult,I feel the same.In fact,I found the story even more wonderful. With her simple yet eloquent writing,Betty Smith takes you on an emotional journey that holds you from the first page to the last. Francie(her alter ego) is a very real,sensitive young heroine,and her family,even with all it's problems is a lovable one.(we could all use an Aunt Sissy!) Her father,though he has a severe drinking problem(and this was long before AA) is a sympathic charactor who truly loves his family,especially his daughter who adores him in spite of his illness,however she's not blind to it,which shows how intelligent she is. There is alot of humor too,which provides a balance thats just right. A beautiful story about growing up and life itself.
B00007GZR5|1.0|I thought that anything was better than watching that *sshole Steve Martin until I saw Robin Williams.  If there were any justice in the United States, Williams would be banned from making films in America and banished to a remote island off the coast of Greenland - where he could live out the rest of his life picking his nose and eating kelp.   <br /> <br />I watched \\"What Dreams May Come\\" from beginning to end and I thought that Williams was about as entertaing as a crutch.  The other actors in the film were equally as forgettable.   <br /> <br />Forget about renting this dvd.  You'd be better off watching your television with both the sound and the picture turned off.  That way, any program you could imagine would be better than this...
B0000646UN|5.0|The Finns did not want war with Soviet Union, but they were not going to cave in to bullying either. This is a story of a small nation in arms, fighting for its independence. Here, there are no heroes, no villains. It is just the dirt, the cold, the fear, the claustrophobia of the bunkers. There are just those that die, and those that accidentally are left alive at the end. <br />These are no action heroes, these are not Hollywood strong men, they just are. They do what they are told, and they do what they can - with any luck they can keep alive for another day. <br />This film is high drama and war in one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A fan of Joss Whedon's other work, it comes as no small statement that I say Firefly surpasses the years of his other work in just a few episodes.  The show presents another side of the science fiction genre.  It questions the idealism of star trek using the historical reframing of the American civil war and constant referencing of other well known sci-fi works.  Captain Mal's ship of loners and refugees are among those not within the Star Trek federation/Star Wars empire/ US Civil War North, trying to live by their own code and ideology.  The show asks and may have one day finished answering, \\"in the predicted trend of consolidation of power, what if you don't like what one power wins out?\\" <br /> <br />Unlike many other pulp sci-fi shows, it presents its audience with an ensemble of rich and engrossing characters able to walk that line between earnest performance and self-aware, post-modern mockery.  In so few episodes the show leads its audience to care deeply for what becomes a traveling family.  There is a moment in the Cowboy Bebop Movie (Firefly's aesthetic, if not other aspects seems influenced by this film's series) when the character Jet Black makes a comment that his bounty hunting \\"crew\\" is not cohesive.  That film's characters are like those of so much mediocre fiction these days, cool, perhaps, but lacking the sort of warmth that makes them successful ensembles and accessible to audiences.  When I finished Firefly I was saddened deeply by my inability to see its crew grow and develop, and even just my inability to see them further.  Of course the film (Serenity) will be another chance, but the tragedy is that something so good would start and die out all but unnoticed.   <br /> <br />Oh yes, and it was well written, acted, and pretty f-in funny. I suppose that's all I needed to say before you moved on to the next review.  Highly recommended for buffy/angel fans, sci-fi fans willing to look at themselves both critically and non-seriously, and anyone wanting to learn conversationally whimsical Chinese curses.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Warner Bros could not have made a better choice with the casting of this movie!! It seems like all of the actors were made for this movie and the music score was excellent. Sometimes I don't play the speaking parts--I just listen to the music--it is just that good!!! The color is vivid and the stars really put on a show--if I didn't know any better, I'd swear Claude Rains was REALLY Prince John and Olivia De Haviland was really Maid Marian and Errol Flynn was Robin Hood!!!!
B00003CXCT|4.0|I cannot say how much these films are a part of my life. They made my \\"going to the movies with my dad\\" days good times. But quickly onto the FINALLY RELEASED dvd's, the documentaries were very entertaining, but the one dissapointing feature i wanted to see in full was the \\"Biggs/Luke Skywalker-Tatoonine Deleted Scenes\\". All you get here is like \\"Slides Of Film\\" that that you just \\"flick\\" through with your fast forward DVD remote. I know of the \\"Star Wars-\\"Behind The Magic\\" PC CD ROM disc, you see the footage of those scenes on there, i just wish you were able to see those scenes in motion picture time on the \\"Bonus Disc\\" DVD. Other than that, about time we see the greatest films in my Movie Going Experience on DVD for my generation (& the next) to enjoy over & over again.

0452285186|5.0|I read this and found it so very funny. I love all the referances to items... like dropping pepper in the eye of sauron... now that is funny.<br /><br />The real problm with this book is I would not pay $8.00 ($10 at brick and mortor) for the book. Like many books I am finding it to be overpriced. Unlike Dilbert which would be funny again and again... death of bunnies well maybe only the first time.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|This movie feels forced, almost like if they had simply shot it to complete the trilogy, the death of the main characters and the ending simply left me aghast because of their absurdity. And all that quasi-philoshophical babble ends being laughable: \\"Cogito ergo sum vis a vis, capicci?\\". Why the trouble of watching three movies if at the end everything is cycled and planned beforehand by the machines? I can only marvel at how far this movie is from that \\"Matrix\\" that amazed audiences and movie critics alike and went to win 4 Oscar movie awards.  Almost always the third installment is the worst in a series: Superman 3, Jaws 3, Alien 3. Don't waste your money and better go and read a good Sci-Fi novel. Carlos M. Santillan H.
B000268QB2|5.0|At last.. I finally got around to buying the album... Easily one of the greatest records of recent years, and miles ahead of the other (admittedly good) British bands that seem to be making a few waves at the moment (about time).. Brimming with emotion and depth... this is an essential purchase for any lover of mature, well written, etheral music. AWESOME stuff!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The production values are as good as I have seen.... and heard. We have known Glenn Frey and Don Henley have stayed in the game. Timothy B. Schmit's vocals are quite remarkable. Most amazing of all, I think, is Joe Walsh. Joe could well be dead by now. His \\"One Day At A Time\\" and \\"Life's Been Good\\" may well bring tears to your eyes. (They did to me). <br />This concert DVD and its thirty Eagles classics is a must for the musical library.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I was too young to remember this trilogy when it first came out, but seeing these movies in my adulthood made me appreciate and understand the most recently released three.  Now I can't get enough Star Wars!!  And like always, Amazon.com came through with the best price and quick shipping.  Thanks Amazon!!
0553381407|4.0|I haven't read the whole thing but what I have has made me cry - I was able to relate to quite a few things....it was a relief to know that my patterns and behavior have reasons (not excuses, but reasons.) <br />Glad I bought it.
0385338686|5.0|I also read the &quot;Undomesticated Goddess&quot; and found it to be a wonderful and witty novel filled with romance. I also read Fire In The Ice by Katlyn Stewart (found it to be awesome as well) and throw in Something Blue by Emily Giffin to boot. All excellent reading material.
0385338686|4.0|While this book is a great by-the-pool summer read, its slightly disappointing.  Can you Keep a Secret was much funnier and, if you can believe it, more believable.  I found Samantha Sweeting a little too flippant for a life-long workaholic.  And without giving anything away, her path to domestic goddess is a little too speedy.  However, it is a funny, light read as all of Kinsella's books are!
0783226845|5.0|In my opinion, only American Beauty is in the same league as Scent of a Woman.  Pacino has done, and continues to do some amazing work, but it will be his performance here that I will always remember.<br /><br />And for the reviewer who thinks this film is morally confused...I think you may have some issues.  The point of the film was that Charlie's integrity was not for sale.  He was not going to give up others (no matter what they did) just to save his own behind.  Your character is based on your own decisions and should not be dictated by the acts of others.  It's a shame that you missed that.
0930289528|5.0|One of the definitive graphic novels - <br />if you like you comics gritty and a tad more realistic then look no further. <br />A mysterious \\"hero\\" , grey morals and an excellent plot combine to make this a thrilling read <br />If your considering a graphic novel - start here
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|this is just as good as toxicity.  absolutely cannot wait for the next half!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Something important for me to let people who may be on the fence in buying this know, is a little background on myself - and that is that I am not a science fiction fan. I enjoyed the original three \\"Star Wars\\" movies, and loved \\"The Matrix,\\" but that's about it. I'm not a fan of westerns, either. I was raised on John Wayne movies, but felt little love for them. The scifi and western genres just aren't generally for me. <br /> <br />So, imagine my surprise when I watched the first episode of \\"Firefly\\" and thought it was actually... good. More than good, in fact. By the time I got around to watching the hilarious episode, \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds,\\" I was beyond hooked. I was a full-fledged fan. <br /> <br />I took a risk in buying the DVD set, based on it's amazing reviews (both on Amazon and in newspapers, etc.), and I'm so glad I did. I would encourage others to do the same. If it turns out that you don't enjoy the show, it's incredibly easy to re-sell it on Amazon (I've done it on multiple occasions with other products) and recoup most of your money.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Forget the previous movies, save for Michelle Pheiffer as Catwoman. Clear your mind and see this film fresh. Christian Bale, whom I never liked before, is Batman. He is the best. Everyone (except Katie Holmes)excels in this movie and it is very fun. I recommend this to see in the theater. After The Island, it is my number two theater pick of the summer.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|TV has really done me a disservice in the last few years.  Its systematically killed all my television programs.  Firefly was one of the worst losses to date too.  Here is hoping Serenity ressurects Firefly, cause now they've even taken the sky from me... and that makes me mad.
078324228X|2.0|For what purpose these lies about the life of this man? Are the liberal film makers racists who don't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie? If someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest. Hurricane carter is not and was not that man. <br /> <br />Facts: <br />In the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell. They want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it. Fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times! <br /> <br />In a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved. Fact, giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape. The depitction is another lie. <br /> <br />Another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder. Fact is that carter's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights. As carter's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people. While in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic. Yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america. Shame. <br /> <br />Norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this. Denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash. Those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood didn't care; they just like the message. Looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet. America bashing and race baiting is alive and well, earning oscars and making for big box office. A shame. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have loved coldplay since \\"parachutes\\" they have a very original sound and they are great musicians, their albums have been great and this is not the exception, if you have the opportunity buy it ! :)

B0002A2WDQ|5.0|On of the most unrated abd best music movies.  <br /> <br />GREAT atmosphere and an education for most about \\"roots\\" music and the path of the blues greats, who then invented Rock N Roll and then invented R&B.   <br /> <br />Excellent acting, fantastic music, great, great atmosphere.  <br /> <br />I would have left the girl out of the movie, but Joe Seneca gives an oscar worthy performance of this real, yet fantasy which taps into blues legend Robert Johnson.
B000002KIE|5.0|When you see a review that calls Sid Vicious the singer, or Johnny Rotten the bassist, click the button that says the review isn't helpful, and move on; Don't even finish reading the review. There's an old Steve Martin bit where he sings \\"Criticize things you don't know about...\\" The uninformed have no business telling someone else what to avoid.<br /><br />\\"Never Mind The Bollocks...\\" is a coarse, horrible-sounding landmark, a real document of one of the most brilliant bits of showmanship ever caught on tape. The songs are loud, hostile, aggressive, and so in-your-face that it is impossible to ignore; it simply had to end soon; nobody can keep up that kind of ferocity for long.<br /><br />First the negatives; these are four misfits who had no place in the world, but had a good idea of what they wanted their music to be. Losing Glen Matlock was the first mistake, even though they never would have found the notoriety they did with him. John Simon Ritchie was a no-talent addict who covered up his shortcomings by being the most vile human being anyone could be, cutting himself on the arm and across the chest; he took a smashed light bulb, and twisted the jagged edge into his left forearm, causing him to wear a thick bandage around his arm, and his lifestyle brought on constant infections. This self-mutilation was often done on stage. His ever-exposed chest showed a matrix of scars of various shapes and sizes, and his upper body was riddled with many, many needlemarks. The black circles under his eyes betrayed his lack of rest and his basic irresponsibility in his life; and changing his name to \\"Sid Vicious\\" only added to the image. In the studio, his bass parts weren't even recorded by him; they were overdubbed by guitarist Steve Jones, and Glen Matlock,except maybe the two selections that featured his name in the writing credits, and maybe not even those. Sad but true, his legacy is one of death and destruction, having stabbed to death the one woman in the world, apart from his mother, who actually loved him; Nancy Spungeon's body was found under a sink, crumpled into a sanguine, bloody mess as he was led away in handcuffs, spitting and cursing at reporters, and further adding to his image as that of \\"bad boy.\\" And he WAS bad. Released on bail, he died of an overdose shortly after. His was a truly Hellish life, and as awful of a man as he was, I have a glimmer of pity for him. How can someone allow theirself to become this?<br /><br />But this band was an incredible powerhouse, a monster unleashed into the world in the late 1970's, when the music scene was turning into a commercialized shell of its former self. Their one \\"official\\" record, \\"Never Mind The Bollocks...\\" was a great counterpoint to this virtual neutering of the industry. Even though the sound is a little muddy, it is as good as any of the hard rockers out before it, or since. John Lydon's (stage name: Johnny Rotten) voice is this strange combination of rant and this element that I've never been able to define, it's almost like something that Jesus would've driven out of demon victims in the Gospel stories. It's one of the strangest voices I've ever heard, and that's saying something.<br /><br />The songs  themselves, are about social interactions (\\"Problems\\", \\"Submission\\") the troubles they have had with record company exec's (\\"EMI\\"), etc., but the real surprise is the pro-life stance in one of the most violent sounding performances ever, \\"Bodies.\\"  The material is just a rage, which, at the time, was unparalleled, even by the violence made famous by The Who. This is hard to picture, but if you ever see a film clip of the Pistols, particularly from the Glen Matlock era, and one of The Who from about 1964 or '65, there are a lot of similarities. In fact(this is useless trivia),When Pete Townshend wrote \\"Who Are You,\\" it's about the night he met Paul Cook and Steve Jones, both of whom called Townshend \\"a great old geezer.\\"<br /><br />This is not pleasant music, and sometimes it can only be appreciated a little at a time, but it is a real watershed moment in the history of rock.ometimes it can only be appreciated a little at a time, but it is a real watershed moment in the history of rock.

B00029LNHS|5.0|When I first heard the BEPs, I didnt really like them, now that I listened to a friends cd fully and bought my own I love them.  Elephunk is my favorite of their albums.  My 15 month old even bops to the beats!
B000002X0Z|5.0|As they did with the Infamous, they brought us another girty and dark album with more polished production work from Havoc. Many Mobb Deep fans prefer Hell On Earth over The Infamous, but I think it was The Infamous that did it for me, as it had a little more depth and more passion. Not saying this album didn't have the same work put in, but saying that, this album had a lot of strong points also with an response from 2Pac's Hit Em Up where Mobb dare to diss the rap icon. Mob get extra billing for that, because not many would response (including the almight king of NY Biggie)
B00006GFAB|5.0|I finally got a chance to review this album after a heavy weekend of monster truck races and professional wrestling pay-per-views, and needless to say, it is the VERY BEST, just like it says on the album cover. It has been said that this album was released simply to support Kiss trinket sales; it has also been said that for every Kiss album ever sold (about 20 million, far less than lousy groups like Nirvana (25 million) or the Beatles (180 million) or those worthless White Stripes who don't even know how to wear proper makeup...GO FIGURE) the makeup boys have had to buy a pound of mascara and 2 pair of panty hose; it has also been said that they have never written a single good song!! Get real!! Pick any track on this album and it is a MUST HAVE CLASSIC! A MUST LISTEN TO while watching professional wrestling or while downing chips.  No one can plaster on the makeup like Kiss, not even Marilyn Manson!! The very best groups EVER, all three of equal talent and originality, are KISS, The Monkees, and of course the SINGING CHIPMUNKS!  Long live Kiss!!  If you miss this album, you are missing out on one of Americas great talents . . . KISS!

B0009I7NNA|3.0|i dont want to be \\"one of those guys\\" who always says the older stuff was better, but i have tired to listen to this cd the whole way through 3 times so i could get a good feel and i havent been able to make it. i have been a fan for a while sounding the 7th trumpet is fantastic, but i really feel they hit the nail on the head with waking the fallen. so buying this cd i didnt even listen to any songs first, and upon first play of the cd, the music is cool pretty much the same, with some definate different changes with some of the softer more melodic (seize the day?) songs but there is not near enough growling, not the same mix of vocals from the first 2 cds. i know bands change become more mature, but i had expectations for this cd and they fell short, if this had been a new band i probably would have given it 4 stars but with A7X i just had higher hopes.I would call this more of a rock ablum then a hardcore album...
B0007M22TI|5.0|Candy to the eyes and ears! I view and listen to this DVD every weekend.
B00005JNSK|4.0|MOVIE: The film opens to a montage of chocolate being made within the factory with the trademark Burton style and the trademark Elfman music. First off we must establish that this movie is aimed at the younger crowd, but I think Depp drew in the older crowd which led to the massive box office success. A lot of people compare this vision to the novel, but I like to look at the classic 1971 version of Roald Dahl's novel. The two are very different movies. Mel Stuart's Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory was much more subtle and a tad bit mysterious. When we see Tim Burton's version it is much more whimsical, zany, and very loud. Burton opens the film with Charlie living in his crooked house (all to similar to Big Fish) down the road from the massive factory.  In Burton's version we get much more backstory about the character of Willy Wonka, we understand why he closed off his factory and why he went into seclusion and that turns out to be the downfall of the movie in an artistic sense. The movie is very entertaining, and it is laugh out loud at times, but in the end that's all that it is. We lose the idea that this is a satire on the way children are raised in today's society. The Oompa Loompa songs have now become broadway musicals instead of quirky rhymes with a point to be made. At times you can barely understand the lyrics of the songs, and that is where the film's message lies.  Burton presents Wonka as a man who is still just a child inside, who is struggling with his lost childhood and strict father.  In the orginal film the audience never really figured out the character of Willy Wonka, and that is why I prefer Gene Wilder's brilliant performance over Johnny Depp's extravagent wardrobes and make-up.  Gene Wilder had a presence, he had joy watching all those kids fall one at a time because he despised their attitudes as well as their parents. Johnny Depp may as well be one of the kids, it looks as if he is enjoying all the sparks and whistles more than seeing that these kids are learning the reality of things, which is the whole point that I feel is being missed.  I like how Tim Burton makes London covered in a blanket of snow, all white, and absent of any color except for the browns on the houses. The moment the doors open to Wonka's factory we are ambushed not only with color from Wonka's wacky wardrobe, but with a visual feast for the eyes within the factory itself.  The movie closes back outside the wintry white city and the character of Willy Wonka does go through a change. But is that really the character we are focusing on? I thought the children were supposed to learn something, not Willy Wonka? Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka already knew everything the kids did, and that was the reason he tested them with the everlasting gobstopper. This movie throws that idea out completely. All in all, it was a fun ride to be had but it feels just like another product of Hollywood. It lost the magic and heart that the original had, and I think it missed the point that Roald Dahl was trying to make.<br /><br />ACTING: Johnny Depp is great actor, everyone knows that. He adds a wacky spin to Willy Wonka that will remind you all too much of Michael Jackson. He is the star of the movie, I believe the next star is Deep Roy. The little man who was cast as every Oompa Loompa you see on screen. I guess it was an easy job since all he had to do was learn the dances and do them on a green screen, he didn't even have to sing.  All the vocals to the Oompa Loompa songs were provided by Danny Elfman, who also did the singing voice of Jack in Tim Burton's A Nightmare Before Christmas. Then we come to the children who I thought were horribly done, all except for Charlie Bucket played by Freddie Highmore. I thought the parents were jokes as well, we see more of the children than the parents and that's a flaw. The original focused on the parents much more because it was the fault of the parents that caused their children to be spoiled.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: It may sound like I hated the movie, but I really enjoyed it. I thought it was funny and entertaining, but I'm just not pleased that movies today are lacking in social commentaries. The original was able to be fun yet still have a very strong commentary. I also liked Gene Wilder's mysterious and menacing Wonka versus Depp's squeaky voiced and pale Wonka. I think A.O Scott of The New York Times hit the nail on the head when he called Tim Burton's Charlie & The Chocolate Factory \\". . . wonderous and flawed.\\"BOTTOM LINE: It may sound like I hated the movie, but I really enjoyed it.

0307155102|5.0|I bought it for my 18 month old, and he LOVES it. He pointed at the pictures and asked for the word at first, and now I say the word and he points at them, or he voluntarily says the words that he knows. My 18 month old has a vast vocabulary because of all the books he has been reading, and Richard Scarry's books are the best!

B00005NDEX|3.0|McCartney has a curious habit:  about 1/3 of the albums he has released since the demise of The Beatles are good for the first half.  Usually, these \\"half-good\\" albums follow his best work.  For instance, the stellar \\"Band on the Run\\" was followed by \\"Venus and Mars,\\" upon which the first half was really good, and the second side dragged.  \\"Tug of War,\\" perhaps his best for pure songwriting, was followed by \\"Pipes of Peace\\"--again, Side One good, Side Two, blandish.  \\"Driving Rain\\" follows a run of excellent CDs, such as \\"Flaming Pie\\" and \\"Run, Devil, Run,\\" and does something I've never witnessed before for Macca:  the first \\"side\\" has only a few songs worthy of McCartney's high standards, but starting with the rollicking rocker \\"About You,\\" things really explode, and every song is fresh and original, devoid of any fluff.  So, if you're willing to buy a CD and enjoy half the songs, buy it.  If not . . .

B0009UVBQI|4.0|Hollywood beware! There's a new director in town and that man is Stephen Chow who brings us an hilarious kung-fu fighting special effects extravaganza of a movie. <br />Set in the 1940's Stephen Chow plays Sing a terrible bandit who poses as a member of the feared Axe Gang along with his dim-witted sidekick in the town of Pig Sty that goes horribly wrong leading to hilarious consequences. <br />With some of the best special effects that could make the Matrix look poor, superb martial arts, quality jokes that humiliate the likes of the Shining and the Matrix nothing can stop Chow from ruling Hollywood and this film from getting into my DVD collection.
B0001AP12G|5.0|As a 40 year old African-American female, I found this CD to discuss the major issues of our people especially decisions we make with our money.  Songs such as \\"Jesus Walks with Me\\" and \\"never let me down\\" bring goose bumps they are so full of truth.  An inspiration to us all
B000002TQB|5.0|\\"Parklife\\"marks Blur's unarguable creative high and is doubtless one of the finest albums to come out of the 90's.<br /><br />What makes \\"Parklife\\" so enjoyable is the way the band continually festoons each song with unexpected details that on the long run make all the difference between good and excellent- the casting of \\"Quadrophenia\\"'s Phil Daniels for the title track and Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier for \\"To the End\\",the Marr-esque guitar of \\"Clover Over Dover\\" or the borrowing of Julian Cope's \\"Spacehopper\\" riff for \\"Bank Holiday\\".<br /><br />It's like a condensation of all the great music Britain produced since the 60's in one package including the Beatles,the Kinks,the Jam,Squeeze,Madness,Julian Cope and the Smiths.
068987474X|1.0|Greg Behrendt is a comic, and a very successful one at that. And, as the  executive producer of a trashy but wildly popular TV series, he's likely highly qualified to write about the tricks of boors, philanders, and charlatans. But he's not a psychologist, and therefore his opinions concerning human behavior are just that, his opinions. Yet, he makes sickening generalizations like, \\"... a guy will ask out a woman ... if he's into her. He might need a little more encouragement than normal, I'll give you that. You might have to lead [him] to water, but you better not help ask him out. Once again, ladies, a wink and a smile will do it.\\"  <br /> <br />Using Behrendt's childishly superficial logic, obese men are that way because they don't to be slim, unemployed men are without work because they don't want jobs, and shy men who endure lifetimes of crushing loneliness do so because they're \\"just not into you.\\" <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002LRX|5.0|Even by today's standards Faith no More's sprawling and skewed masterpiece-\\"Angel Dust\\"-still sounds bizarre and more akin to Mr Bungle records like \\"Disco Volante\\"or \\"California\\" than to their previous outings.<br /><br />By 92 Faith no More's five members had achieved a feeling of simp&aacute;tico and fluid unity that made them effortlessly one of the top bands in the world stage,even if \\"Angel Dust\\" failed to follow the commercial momentum of \\"The Real Thing\\".<br /><br />The band was naturally propelled by Mike Patton's multi layered and ultra versatile vocal range but each member was crucial to achieve their characteristic style,from Jim Martin's razor sharp riffs to Billy Gould's groove heavy bass,Roddy Bottum's bouncy keyboards or Mike Bordin's power drumming.<br /><br />So what's Faith no More's appeal?As I view it it's their knack for deconstructing each style they put heir hands on and making it their own as is made clear by songs such as the punkified cheerleader chant of \\"Be Aggressive\\",the crooned ode to a slob of \\"RV\\",the stream of consciousness narrative driving \\"Caffeine\\" or the fortune cookie based powerhouse that's \\"Land of Sunshine\\".<br /><br />Unique and contrast heavy,what other band would have fitted a Lionel Ritchie cover(\\"Easy\\") almost immediately after a tantalising heavy metal romp(\\"Jizzlobber\\"),\\"Angel Dust\\" continues to challenge catalogation by means of its expansiveness which makes it one of the most fascinating musical experiences in popular music.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|One detail that many are not aware:  all of the italian western films were filmed without sound because it was expected to add sound and voices later after filming.  What resulted was some very interesting dialogues, ampliphied natural sounds.  When Lee Van Cleef arrived in Rome in 1964 to get ready to film \\"For a few dollars more\\", Clint Eastwood gave him good advice and told him to go to a movie theather downtown and watch \\"For a Fistful of Dollars\\" and he emphasized that it was better to see it IN ITALIAN, to understand the film production style of Sergio Leone.  What results is a more drama-like and more opera-like setting of the characters.

Stick with the CD is my advice.  <br /> <br />If you are just wandering in and you are looking to try some samples try these: <br />Siil a Rn (Walk My Love)  <br />Ashoken Farewell <br />S Do Mhaimeo  <br /> <br />They are the best songs on the CD. <br />
0345349571|3.0|I had to give this book 3 stars only to counteract the many reviews giving it 5 stars, because there are points that need to be made (and might otherwise be missed by potential readers) ... it is probably worth 4 stars, though. (I was tempted to give it 2 to get your attention even more) <br /> <br />It is a good book. It is worth reading, although painful at times ... by painful, I mean BORING, incredibly boring, for the last 2/3rds of the book I was wishing it would end. Why didn't I just throw it aside? Because it is worth reading, every so often there are gems of information, it does cover everything quite well, and Coucy's story alone was very interesting.  <br /> <br />I agree with the other reviews written here, there are currently 72 reviews, I have not read them all but most I agree with. There were some negative reviews which almost turned me away from the book, I am glad I ignored them and read it, but I do agree with them that it was very boring at times.  <br /> <br />I can't add much more except to say that it is a large book, very thick, with smallish type, which doesn't make it any easier to chew through it, there are some good photos in it to help break it up a bit.  <br /> <br />If you really want an overview of the period, it is worthwhile. I am just trying to warn you that it isn't exactly a pleasure. <br /> <br />Oh, and my thoughts on all the knights of the time, that I am sure are admired by many readers with concepts of chivalry - those knights were a bunch of idiots, and the concept of chivalry, moronic, hypocritical and pathetic, as seen in every example of everything they did. So it is probably worthwhile reading for anyone bewitched by the popular fiction concept of chivalry.
B00003CXA6|4.0|While the ultra-purists may criticize this movie, many of the battle and camp scenes are excellent teaching tools for young people seeking to understand the realities of life in Civil War armies.  And the artillery barrage that preceded Pickett's charge isn't duplicated anywhere else on film.
0688145078|5.0|I bought this book for my 1 1/2 yr old son, and I think he is starting to understand now that the baby he knows is in my belly will actually be living with us in our house permanently. <br /> <br />Things I personally appreciate about the book are the fact that both mom and dad are present and involved in the baby's care and that certain facts of newborn life (such as crying and the baby's relative helplessness compared with what a toddler may expect) are covered in a matter-of-fact but positive way.  I also like that the book emphasizes how much the parents love the older child and all the ways that he is special (eg \\"I can walk.  I can talk.  I can play with toys.\\") <br /> <br />As I breastfed my son for over a year and hope to do the same with his baby sister, I do wish that nursing were mentioned in some way.  Instead, the only discussion of feeding says \\"Babies like to drink milk\\" and \\"I can help give the baby a bottle.\\"  I think the book is still relevant for the vast majority of families since some will use formula some/all of the time and even among the breastfeeding moms, it's relatively uncommon to encounter a mom who never pumps.  Even if you do plan never to use a bottle, I would definitely still recommend this book.  This is a very small complaint.  Overall, this book does a lovely job of preparing big brothers for their new job!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Ok lets see... This CD to me is not metalcore, it is not hardcore, it is not screamo, it is PURE METAL. You retards that think a bunch of screaming over distorted, untalented guitar riffs is metal. Shame on you. This CD reminds me of Iron Maiden and earlier metallica. It has a bad-ass feel just like the 80's metal scene had. Moving on... HOW BOUT THEM SONGS <br /> <br />I dont feel like writing reviews for each song, so here are the best songs on the CD: tracks, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. seriously they are all great. But out of all the AWESOMELY AMAZING songs, I would have to say that M.I.A. is the best. <br />I relate to it well, for my brother is in the army and is currently in the middle east.  <br /> <br />Now, what have we learned today?  <br /> <br />-This is not metalcore <br />-This is better than that crappy metalcore <br />-Metalcore sucks <br />-This is PURE METAL <br />-Listen to Iron Maiden <br />-This CD is awesome <br /> <br /> Thank you...
B0006L16N8|1.0|Not sure how to start a review on an album that is completely unchallenging and unoriginal.  There's not really much to comment on, because there isn't much there. If you want to be like Coldplay on this album I suggest a few simple steps. <br /> <br />1. Take some memorable lines of lyrics from lots of other stuff <br />2. Put them together in a new order <br />3. Get some backing music from other bands and your last album <br />4. Put it all together, add a heap of distortion so you can't tell one note from another <br /> <br />Of course make sure all the backing music and lyrics are as unchallenging as possible.  A two year old could play most of it accidently on a xylophone. I'm actually not sure how the record company let them release it.  Maybe someone who was in charge didn't have many clues about PR and how to keep a bands reputation.  Because all in all this takes a band that could be viewed as almost something, to a band that you look back at their previous stuff and think, yeh wasn't that good was it.  Seriously Coldplay, for someone with that much talent, what the... <br /> <br />More of the same would've been good enough if they didnt want to extend themselves.
0780020685|5.0|Amazing. A movie that doesn't rely on  a explosion every five minutes to hold the audiences attention,a movie where cinematography  and character development matters,where the characters are more than thin caricatures. Kurosawa should be alive to-day, in order to pull modern cinema out of the muck.This movie is not for our ADD culture, with its epic length and rather slow pace, (not to mention its difficult for westerners to grasp many seemingly bizzare customs of a foreign culture, though I believe the character's actions reach us on profound level that defies cultures and touches upon the human condition) but if you can sit and think  long, buy this movie.

1401206905|5.0|Ever since I picked up the first issue of this miniseries back in the 80's it's been my favorite. The minimalist artwork, the coloring and the story itself blend together in a masterpiece. This version of the birth of the crimefighter has been the inspiration for Tim Burton's Batman (1989) and for Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins as well. <br /> <br />This extended edition has lots of interesting \\"goodies\\" that flesh out how the story evolved from concept to reality. <br /> <br />You may not be a comic book fan, but I'm pretty sure you'll like this. If you liked \\"Batman Begins\\", then I know you won't be disappointed here.
B00005JNJT|4.0|Batman Begins is a reinventing of Bob Kane's original comic book hero, and it is generally a successful transition into the 21st century with some nice wrinkles and updates.  The comic book hero from D.C. Comics has captured the imagination of the public in print, television, and film.  Director Christopher Nolan's vision cleverly takes threads of the original story and merges them with unique twists and turns. <br /> <br />The wealthy Wayne family of Gotham City is well lauded, and young son, Bruce, lives an idyllic, pampered life with childhood friend Rachel.  A chance accident lands him in a cave of bats which begins a cycle of trauma that will culminate in the murder of his parents in the city streets.  A wayward, lost soul, Bruce (Christian Bale) grows into a young man who remains distant despite the support of family butler, Alfred (Michael Caine).  Seeking meaning in his life, he travels the streets of the world to understand the criminal elements until a fateful meeting in Asia with a mentor, Ducard (Liam Neeson), who beckons Wayne to a temple/fortress in a remote mountain.  There, he meets a group of avengers who have great fighting skills and unyielding, harsh justice.  Bruce learns from Ducard to shed his inner fears of bats and harness the feelings of his parents' death.  As Wayne masters his physical and mental prowess, his sense of humanity ultimately collides with the shadow group's ruthless sense of justice. <br /> <br />Wayne returns to and assimilates into Gotham City as a `millionaire playboy' who secretly assumes the symbol of a bat to fight crime as Batman.  In a city of increasing corruption and crime enters crime lord Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) and his cohort, Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) whose alter ego, Scarecrow, will figure in an ever complicated plot.  With support from Rachel (Katie Holmes), who works for the District Attorney, and Detective Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), Wayne also finds within his corporation an advanced weaponsdivision overseen by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) who helps to arm Batman with state of the art body armor and sophisticated devices.  As Batman commences his crime fighting, Scarecrow and ultimately a figure from Wayne's past will threaten Gotham with ultimate doom.  <br /> <br />This film stakes a claim to its own vision and resists previous, formulaic blueprints like Spiderman for depicting super heroes.  With the most recent Batman films reducing the franchise to an uninspired shadow of its former self, someone had sense enough to let visionary director Nolan (Momento, Insomnia) have a crack at it. He has a great knack for incorporating his nightmarish imagery and integrated flashbacks into a brooding, dark exploration of human paranoia, memories and fear.  Nolan cleverly traumatizes young Wayne with bats which ironically will be his salvation.   <br /> <br />This is a different kind of narrative with more mood, psychological depth, and deliberate pacing.  When Batman appears from above, it is an iconic vision of terror and swift justice, the perfect distillation of urban redemption in the guise of a bat facing down evil.  Comic book aficionados will revel in a faithful rendering that stays true to the original's roots and at the same time pays homage to recent updates like the critically acclaimed, Frank Miller's The Dark Knight.  Fans will also be amused at the new interpretations and somewhat poetic license taken on such established conventions as the bat cave, the bat signal, the coming to be of future Commissioner Gordon, and Alfred the butler.  It is refreshing that the hero and villains are not really superhuman like Superman but rather ordinary people who are driven by a psychological bent.     <br /> <br />The only real letdown is that while it starts out on a promising path, it degenerates into a conventional, by-the-numbers action formula in the last fifteen minutes. The story, which admittedly takes its good time to unfold, starts to run out of steamand momentum about three quarters of the way through and drags a bit until the revved up end.   One could almost forgive the obvious teaser at the end which is a deliberate setup for a future sequel. It's ironic that as much as the filmmakers tried to make Batman plausible and grounded in reality, there are credibility gaps especially towards the end.  In one scene, Gordon attempts to operate the Bat vehicle, and it just doesn't ring true.  A fight aboard an elevated train (and earlier fight scenes) is at best standard fare.   <br /> <br />Christian Bale (The Machinist) has been perceived as a rising talent whose persona is that of dark intensity; who better to portray the Dark Knight?  He is surrounded by an exceptional supporting cast.  Caine is effortlessly stoic. It is amusing in one scene to see both veteran pros like he and Freeman counsel Bale.  Liam Neeson is good as a mentor but he is in danger of being typecast in these kinds of roles.  Oldman is cast against type and quite effectively as a good cop. Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) as the leader of the temple is not given much to do unfortunately. <br />   <br />The luscious musical score by committee is appropriately strong and heroic without leaning on a catchy title theme as previous Batman scores have popularized e.g. Nelson Riddle on TV and Danny Elfman in film.  The art direction and set design are impressive in their own interpretation of Gotham City compared to the earlier Tim Burton films which set a new standard.  <br /> <br />By the climax, you root for the film to fulfill its promise but it doesn't quite succeed. Although successes like X Men and Spiderman are good examples of mainstream, pop hero entertainment, the makers of Batman Begins for the most part have raised the super hero film to an art film, and that's not a bad thing.   <br />
0765309408|5.0|Wow.  John Scalzi's book kept me entertained all the way through. I especially liked the way he weaved in details about the technology without distracting the reader from the story flow.  It's a quick, light read that I've actually read twice now.  Great for a long plane trip.
B00000J8EK|3.0|So if hip hop is your thing do you like bad hip hop? Or trance? or anything? <br /> <br />Using your brain is much better. Find the BEST IN ANY GENRE and it will be interesting. Metal, punk, jazz even C&W. Much better than the worst of your chosen genre.  <br /> <br />Now about this recording. I have thousands of CDs. Most of the trance or hip hop goes into the oval file if you ask me. Most of it is hardly worth listening too it's all so similar.  <br /> <br />3.5 stars. Good. Nice to listen to. Not ground shaking but I have to say these guys are into sound - not the stupid rules of the genre. That's what makes this interesting. Instead of a weak copy of other peoples music I can tell these guys are really into listening and doing something different. Pretty rare in this genre area. So buy if you are adventurous. Avoid if you're mind is in a genre tunnel. <br /> <br />And if you are wondering where this music came from all the better. Progenitors are always better than followers. Find the progenitors music and it will be rougher but more interesting. I'll take creativity and adventure over polish any day. These guys had something to do with inventing this music but they've moved on to other areas because they have searching minds: Klaus Schulze, Psycik TV, Eno, Terry Riley, Le Monte Young, Steve Reich, Jon Hassell, Kluster, Ashra Temple.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Crap filled horror/MTV style vanity project lacks a script that makes sense and a leading man who is believable in the role. Keanu Reeves stinks up the screen in one of the worse performances of his career and one of his worse movies ever as a private detective who is trying to stop the coming of the apocalypse. To say to Keanu is miscast is a real understatement because he's worse thing about the entire film. His dried delivery of his lines are legend and will be remembered as one of the biggest fowl up since Batman and Robin of a comic book adaptation. The script is horrendous and the direction lacks professionalism not to mention focus. The only actor in the entire film that does give a real and believably performance is Rachel Weisz, who does more for this film than she should have because her performance is way better than the movie. She's so good in fact that she almost single handedly redeems Keanu's acting, and I mean almost. That's real talent.  <br /> <br />The one star is definitely for Rachel Weisz for at least trying to give the audience someone to care about while the movie itself is uncaring ,forgettable and stupid.  <br />
B0009A1AS2|5.0|With this album, Dream Theater both returns to some of its classic ideas...while also progressing its new sound. I call it Falling into a chang of trains of thought because it is like thoes three albums combined. Falling into Infinity was very focused and centered around songs, rather than showing off. Only 2 songs on Oct. break 10 minutes. (Sacrificed sons is 11 and Octavarium is 24). It also takes the sound from Train of Thought/6 Degrees Dream Theater. The heavy dueling guitar-synth, bombastic drumming and ripping basslines. And of course, everyone will compare Octavarium with A Change of Seasons (DT's other 20+ minutes epic.) ...so lets get to the heart of this thing    What do you get on this album?. Well it opens with a bang, The Root of All Evil. This continues Mike Portnoy's (drums) song[s] about recovering from alcoholism (mike himself has done this). It takes more of the sound of \\"This Dying Soul\\" from Train of Thought, and just simplifies it. It is a rock and roll song, with DT firing on all pistons. It also has a chorus from This Dying soul incorperated in it (Much like This Dying Soul had parts from The Glass Prison). When compared to The Glass Prison and This Dying Soul, the song holds its own, and is very origional (especially the solo section). The Glass Prison still remains one of Dream Theaters best songs, but this is a good song to continue the story.    Next you get The answer lies within. A very slow...very very slow ballad that is very reminiscant of old Dream Theater (The Silent Man, various peices off of Scenes from a memory). Good song, nothing amazing.    Following is These Walls. This is probably my favorite song off the album. It is quite inspirational, but not huge or anything. Jordan's key part and John p's guitar riff's go together nicely. it is a song that just works, and i love the sound. It is the song that best demonstrates Dream Theater writing a SONG. This is when i noticed an interesting little note about the album. Between songs there is 'negative time' (for lack of a better word). This is a common space between songs usually for a few seconds. Well, DT instead put noise/music in this space which leads to most of the next songs. Nothing insane, but i found it very interseting because i had never seen anything like it before. Between These walls and I walk beside you, you hear a clock tick...and then it transisitions into I Walk Beside you. This song has a kick ass intro, but it gets a bit more ballad-y at the chrous. Good song, skipable (much like The Answer Lies Within)    Then.....you get to Panic Attack. This is the heaviest song of DT i've heard yet (much like most of Train of Thought and The Glass Prison before it.) It has some of the best doublebass work by portnoy on record, and its just 8 relentless mintues. Near the end you start to hear a like=ness to Muse. Mike Portnoy LOVES muse, and this is where this connection comes from. But is a good preformance from the whole band and James LeBrie (vocals).     Following is Never Enough, my other favorite songs from Octavarium. Almost instantly when i heard this song, i heard Stolkholm Syndrome by Muse, because the songs are VERY VERY similar. Still equally kick ass though. Not much to say about it, its just a good song.    all of the previous songs were shorter than 9 minutes. This shows dream theater as a more focused band.     Sacrificed Sons is pretty much a continuation of The Great Debate and In the Name of God. Some people like the politicle message, some don't. I particullarly don't, but it is still an execelent song musically. i just don't care for the iraq-war-lyrics. It is a good song though.    Then comes OCTAVARIUM. The 24 minute epic. It is very reminiscent of Neal Morse (both in Spock's Beard and TransAtlantic). It begins with a Pink Floyd-y intro, very airy, with the lyrics coming in. Then comes a great movement with James LeBrie finally writing is own vocals. It has a great Verse which can be heard at the end of The Rootof All Evil. This musical...nuggets, if you will, is very reminiscant from Awake. (The piano part of Space-Dye Vest is in The Mirror) The song progressivly builds and gains speed. At about 12 minutes the song is at full speed. At about 18 minutes it begins the Intervals movemnt. Here, Mike portnoy is heard on background saying \\"Root, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, Octave\\" while James LeBrie sings the lyrics. Each set of lyrics has to do with the other songs on the albums. Root is related to The Root of all Evil, 2nd is The Answer lies Within, 3rd is These walls...etc. A very cool idea. At the end of this, the whole song goes to hell. In the final minutes, the song peices back together and is an extremly satisfying journey.      This is one of DT's best works. It isn't their masterpeice, but it does combine all of DT's best characteristics into one kick ass album. Better than Train of Thought, Equally as good as 6 Degrees, not quite as good as Scenes from a memory, a bit better than Falling into Infinity, Just as good as A Change of Seasons, a bit better than Awake, not quite as good as Images and Words, and a bit better than When Dream and Day Unite. SO if you look at that, i rank it tied for third with 6 Degrees.     Buy it. its good.
0805076476|5.0|there are times when you encounter art.  art moves you, in your eyes.  that is how you know it is art, you've beheld it.  i behold \\"fight club\\" as the pinnacle of literary art of my generation, generation x.  the movie does very good justice to the novel, as good as say \\"one flew over the cuckoo's nest\\" did to it's literary counterpart.<br /><br />\\"fight club\\" is a dangerous novel.  you've heard about those, right?  dangerous in that once fully absorbed, similar to taking a pschyotropic substance, there's no turning back.  while we may call it dangerous, i feel 100% positive that after having read \\"fight club\\" and appreciating it's idiosyncracies and accepting them, the reader emerges a better person.  maybe that's giving chucky p. too much credit.  however, i do feel that strong about \\"fight club\\".<br /><br />on the surface it's a love story.<br /><br />digging down, chuck gasoline douses every piece of corporate, consumer, politically correct sheep-fed cotton candy and ignites it with a blow torch, shattering it when red hot, only to form a diamond of virtue.  this diamond is the sweaty, piss-stinking, remain of humanity that the reader comes to accept simply because by the end of the novel, that is all we're left with.  and we accept it.<br /><br />but not like Project Mayham.<br /><br />the novel does not produce Tyler Durden robots of it's readers.  the novel begs the reader to think about necessities, hand-holds the reader to discern what is and is not important in life, employing the theory of least common denominator.  grind it down till there's only metal.  remove fat.  but only do so for purpose.<br /><br />aside from that rant, \\"fight club\\" is an extremely funny satire.  it's got some of the most clever quotes and ideas.  i love the idea that the fight clubs give domesticated men reason to get in shape, reason to shave their heads.  so much good stuff in here.  read it then see the movie.  there aren't enough differences to recommend one over the other.  i prefer the book and love the movie as well.<br /><br />but most of all, enjoy!  ;o)nces to recommend one over the other.   i prefer the book and love the movie as well. <br /> <br />but most of all, enjoy!  ;o)
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Listening to Bob Dylan is like poetry you get \\"Tangled back in blue\\" whilst \\"Knowing but not knowing what it is\\" and on a hefty trip down \\"Highway 61.\\" <br /> <br />Highway is my second favourite Dylan album and one of my favourite top ten albums, but also it is the one where he went from Dylan the folk guy, to Dylan the rock guy!!! <br /> <br />Also Dylan's story telling is awesome, after a few listens you feel as if he's talking to you, it is scary I know, it's even scarier when t's happening to you, I don't think there's ever been an artist who told stories like Dylan (Though Springsteen comes to mind, he's no Dylan!!!) <br /> <br />Other than go on how great this album is I've decide to jot out my top ten list, hopefully others can check out these albums too (most have 4 1/2 to 5 star averages on Amazon, if you wanna get other opinions first!!) <br /> <br />1. Pet Sounds- The Beach Boys- Perfect Pop, from beg. to end, this made me really respect the BB's!!!! <br /> <br />2. Smile- Brian Wilson- Amazing, 37 years later, Brian Wilson is a personal role modeil of mine because he achieved his dreams despite others and his own self doubts!!! <br /> <br />3. Astral Weeks- Van Morrison- This is the most un-Van Morrison like album ever, and takes a few listens to understand but that when it become a truely beautiful album!!! <br /> <br />4. Darkside of the Moon- Pink Floyd- If there's an album to introduce your kids to it's this, just pure genius!!!! <br /> <br />5. The White Album- The Beatles- At last!!!! I hear you say The Beatles, why not number 1-5, well I personally love them, and this album, 30 songs and harldy any filler, awesome!!!!! <br /> <br />6. Blood on the Tracks- Bob Dylan- The album that made me a Dylan fan, just beautiful, and more so with each listen, his most personal work ever!!!! <br /> <br />7. Led Zeppelin IV- Led Zeppelin- Only the greatest rock album of all time!!!! <br /> <br />8. Forever Changes- Love- Another personal favourite of mine, alotof people might not know this album but if u buy anything in this list let it be this (or Astral Weeks) as these didn't sell as well as the others!!!! <br /> <br />9. Revolver- The Beatles- Brilliant album, Beatles mix pschedellic music into their Pop which results in my opinion their best song Tomorrow never knows <br /> <br />10. Highway 61 Revisited- Bob Dylan- My favourite Dylan album, though I rate it under BOTT, don't let that distract you (it's only a chart, and cos an album is 22 not 2 don't make it crap, it's just the order I placed them, maybe a couple of months later it will be different!!!). <br /> <br />All above are 1960's to mid 70's albums (except Smile). <br /> <br />I also recomend the other albums mentioned below!!! <br /> <br />The Queen is Dead- The Smiths <br />Automatic for the People- REM <br />Exile on main street- The Rolling Stones <br />The Who Sell Out- The Who <br />The Stone Roses- The Stone Roses <br />The Bends- Radiohead <br />Abbey Road- The Beatles <br />The Velvet Underground & Nico- The Velvet Underground <br />Born to Run- Bruce Springsteen <br />Hunky Dory- David Bowie <br /> <br />Hope it heled u!!!!

0930289234|5.0|I read this series in its original form, the 12-issue mini-series, way back when. I was a serious collector of comic books then and I remember being blown away by how literary the books seemed. Nostalgia and a rekindling of my interest in comic books recently prompted me to order this trade paperback collection of the mini-series (did they call them maxi-series back then?). It's just as good as I remembered. Amazing story, with incredible reverbrations and parallels to our world today.
B000002KIK|5.0|I bought this on album and 8 track tape at a \\"Listening Booth\\" the day it came out in October of 1978, almost a full 2 months after i had seen Sabbath at the Spectrum in Philadelphia to support it. Believe it or not, back then it was common to tour before the actual release date of the album. I loved it then as i do now and cannot understand why they still never play even one song from it at any of their shows. My only guess would be is that it has bad memories for Ozzy as his ass was canned soonafter that tour of 78/79. I could go on and on about this record, but there have been many great reviews about it already. I'll only say that it is the third best Sabbath record after \\"Paranoid\\" & \\"Black Sabbath\\" and side one, remember when they used to talk about sides of albums, which is the title track never say die, johnny blade, junior's eyes and a hard road is only surpassed by side one of Paranoid, what else, which includes war pigs, paranoid, planet caravan and ironman. Side 2 of NSD, though a little shaky, is still decent with the gems shockwave, air dance & over to you. Buy it , you won't regret it! <br /> <br />If you can't tell, <br />An ancient sabbath fan(all incarnations)

It  tells a tale of people who dressed up to help others but created more problems for themselves in the long run.<br /><br />Almost every person I know who has read this has no problem reading through the whole thing in one sitting, even though it's like the war and peace of graphic novels.<br /><br />Recommending this for a comic reader is like recommending Sgt.

B000002KB8|5.0|The first metal album by the first metal band. One of the most influential albums in rock history, as well as one of Black Sabbath's greatest. Black Sabbath originally played Blues and were called Earth but one day before a gig they saw a horror movie playing called Black Sabbath. Bassist Geezer Butler then made the poin that people pay to see scary movies, so why not make them pay to listen to scary music? This resulted in a name change, as well as the invention of a genre. The original intent of metal was to sound scary, and this album represents that very well.  The opening track, Black Sabbath, opens with church bells and a thunderstormuntil Tony Iommi starts in with playing a tritone on his guitar, eventually leading into an interlude, entirely in triplets, and an excellent solo. Very eerie and one of metal's inspiring moments. But that's just the first song. The Wizard is another good track, and NIB has one of the catchiest tunes I have ever heard. Excellent in all areas.
B0009KA7BS|2.0|The overall concept and story either must be taken comic book like or serious.  \\"Constantine\\" tries to do both, which undermines a strong wealth of production values and direction.  The actors: Rachel Weisz, Djimon Honsou and Peter Stomare all have found the right tone for their parts.  Unfortunately Keanu Reeves is miscast as an adult.  He should only do parts that require him to be juvenile, which is why the \\"Matrix\\" movies were perfect for him. <br /> <br />I was put off at the beginning because Constantine has a smoking habit...well any smoker worth their weight in nicotine will tell you that the way Keanu smokes a cigarette is on par with a 12 year old girl trying it for the first time at a slumber party. <br /> <br />So how can you build a premise on lung cancer if you dont even take it into your lungs? <br /> <br />Also,when is Hollywood going to realize that you can throw CGI on the public but that does not mean that it will be worth anything.  Constantines descent to Hell should be terrifying but it is just another day to him. <br /> <br />Studios really should go back to the days of screen testing.  They should ignore actor ego and test to see if they fit the part.  I am so tired of seeing movies that have a lot going for them except an essential element.

B000003TA4|5.0|There's not much more to be said about \\"Nevermind\\" beyond how this one album started the sound that defined an entire decade of alternative rock music.  Furthermore, it plays as well today as it did more than a decade ago when it first hit the music scene. <br /> <br />If you like \\"Nevermind\\", I would also recommend that you purchase the box set \\"With the Lights Out\\", which is a collection of demos and uncut rehearsals in addition to some more refined and polished studio recordings from Nirvana's earlier years.  I like listening to the two back-and-forth to gain a sense of context and a greater appreciation for the music of Nirvana.
B00009UW0N|5.0|In the spring of 1978, young director and then virtually unknown John Carpenter and his girlfriend/writing partner, the late Debra Hill crafted a simple tale of a night of terror for a babysitter (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her two friends (Nancy Loomis and P.J Soles) at the hands of the scariest monster in horror movie history, Michael A. Myers.  It is, like I said, a simple story that anyone at virtually any intelligence level can understand.  What makes this movie scary, besides the downright creepy music, which is again, a simple score that John Carpenter himself wrote, is all of the implied sequences that take place, which proves once again you don't have to have nonstop blood and gore to make a horror movie work.  Most of the movie is very much left to the audience's imagination.  While this movie never won any Oscars or even garnered any nominations, it really never needed to.  The plot is, like the key word to this movie, simple: Michael Myers brutally murders his older sister on Halloween night, 1963.  Sixteen years later, on October 30, 1978 he escapes the Haddonfield Mental Hospital in search of, as we discover in Halloween II if you've seen it, his sister, which is Jamie Lee Curtis.  The body count continues to rise until he reaches her in the film's horrifying conclusion.  As a very entertaining sidebar to the main plot, the late Donald Pleasance delivers an outstanding portrayal of Myers' doctor, Sam Loomis who is determined to find Michael and lock him up before it is too late, the latter in which he fails.  He spends basically the entire film explaining and trying to convince skeptical people from the nurse at the beginning to Haddonfield's Sheriff (Charles Cyphers) just how dangerous Myers is and what kind of monster has been unleashed on Haddonfield.  The following is an excerpt of one of the most haunting scenes in the film:<br /><br />Sheriff: I think your just plain scared.<br /><br />Loomis: Yeah I am-I-I met him sixteen years ago.  I was told there was nothing left.  No reason, no understanding of even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of right or wrong.  I met this six year old child with this blind pale emotionless face and the blackest eyes.  The devil's eyes.  I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply...evil.<br /><br />The element that is omni-present throughout this entire film is this almost overwhelming feeling of dread, that is literally there from start to the horrifying finish.  One of the things I was most surprised about this movie, unlike its mostly awful sequels, is that there is almost no blood or gore in this movie whatsoever.  This film was also made so dirt cheap ($300,000) some Hollywood hot-shots today would probably wonder how it could have been made.  This film proves without a doubt that a movie does not have to cost millions of dollars to film and include buckets of blood and gore to be successful and be entertaining to watch.  This film made over twice as much as what it cost to film, and that should say plenty.  Bottom line: if you want a film that will scare the pants off of you for 90 minutes and leave you sleeping with the lights on for several nights afterward, Halloween is the film for you.  Horror the way horror should be made: gritty and dark to the core.s nothing left.  No reason, no understanding of even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of right or wrong.

B00005MNP8|5.0|Man, we wore this album out more than once when I was in college back in the 80s.  Blondie WAS the 80s, and everyone else were mere followers.  Don't believe me?  Back in the 70s, when everyone else was busy making the worst music ever, Blondie was living in vans and run-down apartments, already playing their 80s music in the streets and nightclubs to whoever would listen.  They were literally years ahead of their time. <br /> <br />I can't believe I went so long without a copy of \\"Parallel Lines\\", but I'm glad they're back in my life.
B00005JNJT|5.0|In this fifth installment of the ever popular Batman feature film series, Christian Bale suits up as our caped superhero.  Overall, Christian handles the role of Batman very effectively, complete with the scratchy, raspy voice that is downright creepy.  He is a little bit less convincing as Bruce Wayne, although who watches a Batman movie to see Bruce Wayne?  I thought the fighting scenes were done well, but most were shot so close-up to the action I felt like I wasn't seeing half of the scene.  That is the one downside to this movie, if it has any downsides.  Supporting Bale are Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow.  Michael Caine brings the character of Alfred to a whole new great level although I would still take Michael Gough as Bruce's butler anyday.  Katie Holmes I thought did a decent job as the assistant DA/Bruce Wayne's love interest, although I feel the film could have gone on without her.  Finally Cillian Murphy does a great portrayal of the big villain in the fim, the Scarecrow/Dr. Jonathan Crane.  Unlike in previous Bat films, where there is usually one or two villains or bad guys, in this film there is at least 5 if not more.  The Scarecrow is a genuinely alarming and menacing bad guy and is definitely a step up from the goofball Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin, the worst film in the series.  Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman are great additions to the cast as well as great portrayals of their characters, Neeson as Wayne's mentor and Freeman as Bruce's ally in Wayne Enterprises, remeniscent of Q in the James Bond series.  Basically, this is the story in a nutshell: Bruce Wayne, seeking to restore Gotham City to its glory days before crime and corruption eroded it, sets out to be trained and taught all about the fundamentals of putting fear into the hearts of those who do evil, and the physical force necessary to stop them.  Ra'as Al Guhl (Ken Wattanbe), along with Ducard (Liam Neeson) train Bruce on the skills that he desires.  Scarecrow, along with a slew of corrupt cops in the Gotham City Police Department, set out to unleash a fear toxin upon the city using Gotham's water supply and a microwave transmitter.  There are also some plot twists involving Ra'as Al Guhl and Ducard as well, but telling them here would seriously pretty much reveal the whole movie.  It is up to Bruce Wayne, who designs the Batsuit and the Batmobile with the help of Morgan Freeman's character, to put a stop to the Scarecrow/Dr. Crane's plans.  A very well told story, it thoroughly explains Bruce's youth and the entire backstory of the film that ultimately turns Bruce Wayne into his alter-ego, Batman.  A superbly casted, and well directed film by Chris Nolan, this movie represents Batman's best.  Gone are the silly anatomically correct Bat costumes, and the cartoonish villains, as well as the so-so Batmobile and gadgets.  There is nothing silly, cartoonish or so-so about this great movie.  The best movie of 2005 hands down, Batman Begins.

B00006RAKP|4.0|I purchased this CD set as a beginner fan of Elton John. I listened to the CDs until the songs' lyrics were burned into my brain. Since then I have bought many Elton John CDs and realised that these songs arn't his GREATEST greatest hits. Don't get me wrong, all of these songs are fabulous but still there are so many others which could have been included instead. Songs like 'Healing Hands', 'The Last Song', 'Border Song', 'Harmony', 'Simple Life', 'A Word In Spanish', 'Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters' have been wrongly left out. In my opinion, any new Elton John fan who is looking for a great collection of the Rocket Man's hits need to look no further than the 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' album.

B0000TB01Y|4.0|I have yet to see Wicked on the stage, or to read the book.  I must say that the songs are very colorful and enjoyable.  However, I must recommend that if you are looking for the story to go with this music, see the play or read the book first!  The songs are not very self-explainitory as with some other musicals like Rent or Evita.  There seems to be great gaps in the story line between songs.<br /><br />To sum up, good music, but know the story first!
B00005JKED|4.0|...well at least until the last 10 minutes when it regresses to the usual mano-a-mano action flick cliched showdown between the two lead characters.  But even those last 10 minutes---when most mainstream flicks go straight down the toilet with some brainless cop-out, focus-group-@sslicking, producer-coerced, crowd-pleasing ending---are fairly low-cheese in this movie, surprisingly enough.  For at least three quarters of this movie I was on the edge of my seat, it kept me guessing all the time...ahhhh!<br /><br />Most surprising is the subversive and cynical edge this film has (as brilliantly articulated by Denzel Washington), even though it is counterbalanced by Ethan Hawke's stubbornly moralistic character.  Too many action flicks these days are pat, law-and-order civics propaganda, this one is fairly ballsy to avoid all that---I'm sure it's led those nutjob A.M. (Angry Mongoloid) talk show hosts and Faux News idiots to immediately label it a \\"socialist\\" movie, heh.  Both of these fine actors put in fine performances, and Eva Mendes provides just enough eye candy to keep our interest during the very few slow parts.<br /><br />Also a very strong soundtrack, if you have a surround sound system and a good subwoofer you will be rewarded.<br /><br />So rare to find a mainstream action flick like this, most of them are paint-by-the-numbers ordeals that you can predict from the first 5 minutes.  Director Antoine Fuqua is a talent worth watching for!
B000002KKS|5.0|What a comeback album!! Its not easy to change musical direction and at the same time release such an amazing album. However, and I may be splitting hairs here, I think side 2 (I used to have the cassette)is weak compared to side one. Walk Away and Wishing Well are not that great in my opinion. While on the subject, I, like other reviewers have expressed, am not too keen on Lady Evil. <br /> <br />Undoubtedly, the arrival of Dio injected Sabbath with a much needed breath of fresh musical air and an energy which can be heard in their music.A total juxtaposition to Never Say Die! where the Sabs sounded tired and uninspired. I've had this album for ages and is still one of my favourite Sabbath releases although it is my least favourite out of all the albums recorded with RJD. Neon Knights is a tremendous rock song and the title track will blow you away. Probably one of the best songs of the genre.  <br /> <br />It doesn't really matter whether you have heard any Ozzy era Sabbath or not at this point since Heaven & Hell does not resemble anything that was recorded by Sabbath in the 70s. However, this is a must have album for anyone who is a fan of the genre. The same as the first Black Sabbath album laid a template for metal/ hard rock music in general, this one did the same for the sub-genres that were to emerge in the 80s. A classic. <br /> <br />It's such a shame that Dio left. Imagine what could have been had this incarnation of Sabbath remained together for the rest of the 80s. <br /> <br />
B0009W5JS2|2.0|Pretty entertaining with an above-average script for this kind of movie. Adequate doses of action and humor; lots of vehicular action (boats, cars, tanks, and a train); a little bit of silly sermonizing about throwing money at America's enemies until they like us; but fun nevertheless, if you can take Ice Cube's constant scowl.<br /><br />The movie does cheat, though; we don't see how XXX escapes a competently-organized dragnet while he's in the water, and the gunfights are totally lacking in any smarts - one side fires, the other side fires, one side dies. Whoopie.<br /><br />If you can ignore these problems, you'll enjoy it.
B000002KMY|5.0|I also prefer Mob Rules to its predecessor, Heaven & Hell. While the latter is an extremely well-written rock album I always felt that side 2 was somewhat weak except Die Young. This, on the other hand is solid from top to bottom, the weaker track being only Slipping Away, I feel.  <br /> <br />In reality you can't really compare Dio Sabbath to Ozzy Sabbath as the styles are inherently different. Out of the three albums recorded with Dio I think this is second only to Dehumanizer which just about shaves the top spot over this. Yes- I am saying that I think Heaven and Hell is the weaker of the 3 albums with RJD. <br /> <br />Mob Rules is a tour de force and an excellent album for the time. Sure, maybe it doesn't stand up that well 20 odd years later but neither does H&H, in my opinion. <br /> <br />If you are into post Ozzy Sabbath get this. It took me years to do so and i'm dissappointed in not having done so earlier as this album rocks. And there is a hidden gem within called Falling of the Edge of the World.
0553205145|5.0|This is a wonderful and highly original novel about a mentally challenged man named Charlie who wanted to be smart. One day, his wish was granted. A group of scientists selected him for an experimental operation that raised his intelligence to genius level. Suddenly, Charlie found himself transformed, and life, as he knew it, changed.<br /><br />His story is told entirely through Charlie's eyes and perceptions in the form of progress reports. The reader actually sees the change in Charlie take place, as his progress reports become more complex, well written, and filled with the angst of personal discovery and growth, as well as with his gradual awareness of his amazing and accelerated intellectual development.<br /><br />The progress reports are a wonderful contrivance for facilitating the story, and the reader is one with Charlie on his voyage of self-discovery. What happens to Charlie in the long run is profoundly moving and thought provoking. It is no wonder that this author was the recipient of the Nebula Award which is given by the Science Fiction Writers of America for having written the Best Novel of the Year. This is definitely a book well worth reading.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|never dreaming i would live long enough to see the eagles perform live, i felt blessed to attend their concert here in louisville.  they came onstage, they played their songs, took a short intermission and came back out to generate a substantially longer concert than most modern-day artists would dare attempt without costume changes and backup dancers.  they are musicians first and showmen seldom.  this dvd captures the essence of the eagles music, the wallpaper of most of our lives.  whether it is a simple catchy tune you cannot get out of your head like \\"there's gonna be a heartache tonite...\\" or the exquisite turn of a phrase like \\"they say that anger is just love disappointed\\" the eagles are able to put it all out there for those of us who are unable to do so.  as much of a surprise as was 1994's \\"hell freezes over\\", this phase of their 'farewell 1 tour' is a MUST for anyone who appreciates artistry instead of showbiz.  thank heaven and irving azoff for getting the eagles back out on the road!
0333735420|5.0|This is a poignant, compelling narrative about Chris McCandless, an intelligent, intense, and idealistic young man, who cut off all ties to his upper middle class family. He then reinvented himself as Alexander Supertramp, a drifter living out of a backpack, eking out a marginal existence as he wandered throughout the United States. A modern day King of the Road, McCandless ended his journey in 1992 in Alaska, when he walked alone into the wilderness north of Denali. He never returned.<br /><br />Krakauer investigated this young man's short life in an attempt to explain why someone who has everything going for him would have chosen this lifestyle, only to end up dead in one of the most remote, rugged areas of the Alaskan wilderness. Whether one views McCandless as a fool or as a modern day Thoreau is a question ripe for discussion. It is clear, however, from Krakauer's writing that his investigation led him to feel a strong, spiritual kinship with McCandless. It is this kindred spirit approach to his understanding of this young man that makes Krakauer's writing so absorbing and moving.<br /><br />Krakauer retraced McCandless' journey, interviewing many of those with whom he came into contact. What metamorphosed is a haunting, riveting account of McCandless' travels and travails, and the impact he had on those with whom he came into contact. Krakauer followed McCandless' last steps into the Alaskan wilderness, so that he could see for himself how McCandless had lived, and how he had died. This book is his epitaph.
6302821681|3.0|It always surprises me about how much I really enjoy a lot about animated goofiness from the Looney Tunes era. That has arguable been the case with Warner Brothers for several years, and their group of second bananas. I really most of the time find them funnier than the main acts like Bugs and Daffy. Elmer Fudd is arguably one of those kinds of characters. Yet, he has always been under the shadows as the middle-man between Bugs & Daffy from their ups and downs of Duck & Rabbit seasons. However, he has had very few chances to shine on his own in that attempt, and that has came through on his video collection.<br /><br />The 1993 Elmer Fudd: School Of Hard Knocks, is a compilation of five cartoons featuring his royal fuddness, going through his motions after Bugs & Daffy, as well as others. The collection does a little better job of highlighting Elmer away from Bugs & Daffy with cartoons like Pests For Guests: the only time he goes against The Goofy Gophers (Mac & Tosh), Each Dawn I Crow: In which a rooster suspects Elmer the farmer is trying to kill him, and a few toons against Bugs & Daffy like Don't Axe Me, Upswept Hare, and Robot Rabbit. The cartoons are very funny, but it is only the second collection of Elmer's humor in the world.<br /><br />Although this collection is fairly good, is really isn't as definitive as the 1986 Elmer Fudd's Comedy Capers from Warner Brothers Golden Jubilee 24 Karat Collection. Nevertheless, Elmer Fudd's School Of Hard Knocks is still a fan pleaser for anybody who loves the classic cartoons he has been in with the Looney Tunes for years. This is not really a must buy, but it is a fan pleaser nevertheless.<br /><br />Cover: B<br /><br />Cartoons: C+<br /><br />Mastering: B<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+
B0009A1AS2|4.0|*I have been an avid fan of this band since the release of When Dream and Day Unite. Yes, that's before Images & Words.*    Following the much-needed earthen heaviness of Train of Thought (I can't comprehend why anyone claiming to be a DT fan would think ToT too heavy, the band has been heavy since day 1) DT shifts gears again.    This recording would easily get 5 stars if there weren't any throw-away songs and was amazing from beginning to end. As it stands, however:    1. The Answer Lies Within, the ballad at track 2, is ... completely uninspiring to me. Sorry!    2. The chorus of I Walk Beside You (track 4) does nothing for me either. Heard it before. The verse is interesting however and redeems the song. *The next person that relates this song to anything resembling U2 should be struck by lightning. Where on earth do you manage _that_ comparison?*    3. I feel like I have to fast foward through the beginning of Sacrificed Sons to get to the good stuff. But man, is the good stuff good.    However, the remaining entirety of the recording is sublime, brilliant and just when I think after 16 years there isn't anything left by DT to make my jaw drop, they do it again.    There are instrumental sections throughout that, as always, will send chills up your spine. The Petrucci/Rudess gunslinging just keeps getting better, more focused, more intricate and utterly breathtaking. These guys are in top form.    As may have been said elsewhere, the 24:00 title track is worth the price of admission alone. Instant prog classic.    If you refine out several of the aforementioned 'bleh' moments, you have some of the best music DT has penned in the last decade.

B0006L16N8|5.0|I love Coldplay, but when 'X&Y' was released I couldn't help but wonder if their deeply contemplative, melancholic style had grown old on me.    However one listen to 'X&Y' proved to me that this band is one that is still improving despite their already excellent quality and massive success.    To me 'X&Y' is better than any of their previous work because of 2 things:  (i) the sound is richer - the instruments are magnificently played/blended and the melodies more varied  (ii) the lyrics are even better than before - still simple and poetic, but more intriguing and emotionally balanced     'X&Y' is certainly less depressing and sedative than their previous work. Compare \\"lights go out and I can't be saved/ Tides that I tried to swim against/ You've put me down upon my knees/ Oh I beg I beg and plead\\" of their past hit 'Clocks' to \\"if you never try you'll never know/ Just what you're worth/ lights will guide you home/ And ignite your bones/ And I will try to fix you\\" on 'Fix You' in the current album.    Every song is terrific, but I will just highlight these:    1. Square One - Hard to choose between this and Fix You as the best track. A mysterious, ethereal opening similar to the legendary Japanese New Age musician Kitaro. Then Martin's soothing vocals, followed by a beat that really MOVES and a regal guitar refrain that ROCKS, big time - without trying too hard. The lyrics are brilliant: \\"From the top of the first page/ to the end of the last day/ From the start in your own way/ You just want somebody listening to what you say/ it doesn't matter who you are.\\" So true.. and so humbling.    3. White Shadows - the stunning electric guitar and storming drums will make white shadows dance in your head. The lyrics are a struggle between a desire for change and a need for stability.    4. Fix You - wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Elegantly simple in its portrayal of cracks and splinters in the human psyche and their effects on relationships. The electric guitar refrainis so exquisitely simple and moving -- it really takes me places. Add to that the four-part harmony that unites the whole band - and I think this could be a rock anthem for our times.    5. Talk - mercurial electric guitar work. Simple theme about one man's desperate need to communicate with a brother, to seek advice, understanding and connection. Coldplay translates the bond of blood into music.    7. Speed of Sound - amazing keyboard work at the start that sounds very English in its dignity and poetry. Song gathers pace and launches spectacularly into the by-now famous chorus. Martin's falsetto style at its very best - so detached, yet so engaged.    More emotionally balanced between the optimistic and pessimistic, but even better musically and as intelligent and profound as their previous work. That's 'X&Y' in a nutshell. Only 5 years have passed in this century, but I'm going to take a bold stand and say that this is going to be a strong contender for Album of the Century.
B000002KXV|5.0|Donald Fagen's first of two brilliant solo albums \\"The Nightfly\\" is a bit of a departure from his earlier Steely Dan efforts. Not so much in sound and style but perhaps lyrically. It's songs more upbeat, romantic and dare I say optimistic than Fagens earlier work. The songs mostly reminicse about Fagens youth growing up during the cold-war era of the 50's and early 60's. These songs are less about paranoia and more about the hope that the future brings. A nostalgic, romantic thought but not what we're used to from Donald Fagen. Still this is a fine album because Fagen is a gifted musician and as with Steely Dan he brought in other gifted musicians to compliment him. I only wish that they would remaster this CD because the sound quality is- how would I say- not good. If your a big fan of this album as I am you should pick up it's DVD-Audio. It plays on any DVD player and the sound, even the non-DVD-Audio sound, vastly improves on the CD sound quality. It also includes a video for \\"New Frontier\\"  which is nice. Anyway, if you like Steely Dan I'd say pick up this album.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Dumb horror thriller that not only does not make any sense what so ever but also has some of the worse acting ever by Keanu Reeves, who should not be in the film in the first place considering how bad he was in the main role. The only redeeming piece of acting in the whole movie comes from Rachel Weisz but she is literally alone in that reality while most of the actors involved look like they either were sleep walking in there roles or they did not want to be there in the first place. Peter Stormare was great as well but he's only in the last five minutes of the film and his role is really a bit part. I just found out recently that the characters were based on a comic book called Hellblazer judging by the free comic that came with the DVD and that little comic book was better written and better plotted than the main movie itself. Too bad the movie was not based around that book instead of the mess we have in this film. That would have been a cool film to see other than the garbage that is this film.
B00005RHGK|3.0|This movies has a real mood that hits dead on the mood and style of 70's horror flicks (much like Cabin Fever) although it doesn't really do much other than use certain camera techniques and a psychic woman it does it pretty well.  The Creeper is a very cool creature, and the arguing brother and sister aren't really a common set of main characters in other movies, so they help with the believibility of the story.  The story pretty much revolves around two siblings trying to get away from a monster guy who drives a really sweet (yet durty and old) truck and tries to eat them.  The whole point is that he likes to scare people and that's why he doesn't kill them at first.  He only is awake for 23 days every 23 years (I own the movie and I'm not for sure on that though).  There are some pretty cool scenes that add a little suspense and some locations that add to the overall creepy (no pun intended) mood of the story.  Victor Salva, who has an interesting past that I won't go into, does not focuse as much on blood and gore as he could, but goes more for suspense and scares, which is cool since we get enough gore in this day and age.  I think horror fans should go for this, but I'm not sure if the casual moviegoer will enjoy this.  They might not understand it's purpose.

B00004Y6NX|5.0|All of Dire Straits' albums were great, no argument. However, no other album had as dynamic of play list as \\"Making Movies.\\" Every song is so strong. It is Mark having fun and making the first Dire Straits' album that embraces popular acceptance. However, by no means does that mean this album sells out. The songs are pure and some, very emotional. \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and \\"Skate Away\\" show us a Mark Knopfler that we had not yet heard up to that point. \\"Espresso Love\\" and \\"Tunnel of Love\\" are right up there with the greatest Dire songs ever. I have owned this album for twenty years and it has never, ever, gotten old. Perfection!
B000002AZ8|5.0|VITALOGY is something only one of Pearl Jam's other albums has been able to accomplish: it is a work of passionate artistry (NO CODE is the other album). Althought TEN was a modern rock classic and VERSUS showed Pearl Jam had some variety and different sides of their music, VITALOGY is where all of their musical ambition and experiemntal side come together to form a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Sure, it has a throw-away track or two, but those spots don't really matter much because the rest of the album is so good. It starts out on a great note, with the death-themed thrash-punk song \\"Last Exit\\". It ends with the very strange seven-minute eerie \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\\".  <br /> <br />Something I noticed about Pearl Jam's third album in comparison to their other attempts is that it has a distinctively raw, almost garage-esque sound to it, courtesy of Brenden O'Brien's excellent production, that makes it seem so much more real than PJ's other efforts. <br /> <br />This album's tone is notably darker than any other album by Pearl Jam. There are many songs about death (\\"Immortality\\", \\"Last Exit\\"), regret (\\"Nothingman\\"), anger and loss (\\"Corduroy\\", \\"Not for You\\"), and dislike of authority/people/organized religion (\\"Satan's Bed\\", \\"Tremor Christ\\", \\"Whipping\\"). There are a few lighter spots, such as the groovy, funky instrumental \\"Aye Davanita\\", and the tribute tp vynal that sometimes cleverly resembles a drug-themed song \\"Spin the Black Circle\\". But overall the album's colors are grey and black, as much of the album deals with negative things, which actually makes it seem much more honest and enjoyable. <br /> <br />The highlights of the album are Eddie Vedder's rant against fame \\"Corduroy\\", the Kurt Cobain suicide-inspired \\"Immortality\\", the regretful, angry \\"Not for You\\", and the beautiful ballad \\"Nothingman\\". What some people consider to be the lowpoint of the album, \\"Bugs\\", is actually just one of the few spots of humor to me, being a song about paranoia/the media played pretty much just with an accordian and being nearly spoken-word. I found it to be a light spot in the middle of a very dark tunnel. <br /> <br />Like Nirvana's IN UTERO, VITALOGY has one or two throaw-aways but as a whole the album is so good that you forget about those one or two songs. Both albums were moments of triumph and originality for the two \\"rival\\" grunge bands, filled with masterful songs that they completely put their hearts into. This is the quinnessential Pearl Jam album, their masterpiece of their careers. Pearl Jam's best piece of art is like any artist's best: it has a few rough spots but is overall a work of inticate beauty.
B0002Z0EYA|2.0|Aside from all the historical and mythological errata, Wolfgang Petersen can't seem to handle actors very well.  Most performances were over the top - it's a wonder any scenery was left after this bunch got through chewing it.  With the exception of Mr. O'Toole and Ms. Christie (both alumni of David Lean directed epic films and both of whom had very brief moments of dialogue/monologue), the other actors could have used a circus ringmaster to keep them in line.    To use the most improper English I can - \\"Troy\\" ain't no \\"Lawrence Of Arabia\\" and Wolfgang Petersen t'ain't no David Lean!
B000002J09|2.0|It's  a tough decision to  give 2 stars to a Led Zeppelin album, because I'll burn in hell for it. I'm not interested in any kind of \\"fans wars\\" ...Led Zep fans don't like Limp Bizkit or Avril Lavigne fans and vice versa or that kind of nonsese. At 35 I'm  more open minded now. And it's very diifucult -actually impossible- to be objective about music, so my very subjective appraisal of tbis albums is;    Black Dog - Incredibly annoying song. I wish Robert Plant would shut the hell up.  And the main riff is as annoying as a British DJ or that Smurfs album in the 70s. Stop...start...stop...start...stop...start....stop...start...It's like effin' Chinese water torture...Agghh! I can't stand it!    Rock And Roll- Retro nostalgia for the 50s by the band. \\"it's been a long time since I rock and rolled\\" It seems even in 1971 rock was dead and people yearned for some mythical golden age of music where everything was better. Sound familiar? Ah, they're sentimential guys at heart, but I find the song incredibly annoying. And was it recored in the basement? Sounds like it.     Battle Of Evermore- Led Zep are more than just rockers! Wow! I find that incredbily awesome. Most band are more than just rockers though, even Motorhead, and manage to be less repetive. And I wish Sandy Dennis  would sing in harmony with Plant, Or should Plant sing in harony with Sandy? Appeals to everyone's inner hippy.      Stairway To Heaven-  I don't care about any Taurus connections- what concerns me is I hate the song. All the pseudo spirtual fairy nonsense really bugs me. Almost as much as Plant singing higher thsn The Bee Gees on the finale. And I hate it when Plant sings \\"She's BUUUUUYYYYiinngg the stairway to heaven\\" Ugh! Only a man with beads around his neck could possibly sing this one. The music behind it isn't that great either. Quite mediocre really. I'm guaranteed to burn in hell for that. Oh well. Another hippy anthem. Yuck.    Misty Moutain Hop- This song I find laughably bad. Really. Areally silly song that The Monkess would find sub par. I suppose Zep were going more happy and poppy, but the song blows. For my money this song is the nadir of Zeppelins career. Possibly excepting...    Four Sticks- A really clumsy song, it lurches along ike Frankensteins monster. One of the most awkward sounding songs I've heard. I really dislike it. And whether the guitar is meant to sound that bad or is Page's choice I don't know. Horrible vocal performance by Plant.      Going To California- Nice folky tune, but I wish Plant would unblock his nose.At times he almost croons like Dean Martin (although there's no way Plant could go baritone!)    When The Levee Breaks- Nothing too original but one of led Zeppelins best performances Hurrah!       Whether or not Led Zeppelin set the stage for the 70s doesn't concern me. I'm no longer prone with that kind of hero worship. I listened to this album.. and listened...and decided I didn't like it very much. So I give it 2 stars. The production is generally bad, even for 1971, and many of the songs are just annoying to my ears.     People sare always saying to others that they  MUST respect Led Zep for waht they did. Apart form the fact that I rather resent complete strangers telling me what to do do, I would rather base my judgement of  band as to whether I like the music, not some dogmatic insistence on worshipping something because of it's influence.
B00005ATZT|5.0|The Fugitive is one thriller that you can't go wrong with. First of all, most of the good thrillers that I have seen are rated R, while on the other hand, this is rated PG-13. That is always nice to have some great thrillers rated PG-13. So, more people can see them. Anyway, the movie has great action, great suspense, great acting and an amazing escape from the prison transport vehicule. This is also one movie that never gets old. I have seen it probably 7 or 8 times and it's always so awesome.  <br />The movie is about a surgeon wrongly accused of murdering his wife. This surgeon escapes from the prison transport vehicule and sets forth to find the real people that killed his wife. But, the cops are everywhere after him. The movie has a great conclusion, nonstop suspense and is a thriller that is necessary in every collection. <br />Oh, and by the way, I find this movie to be Harrison Ford's best movie and not Indiana Jones.

Besides the four front guys, the supporting musicians are all great and everyone looks to be enjoying themselves. <br /> <br />Everyone will have their favorites, but for me it is \\"One Day at a Time\\", Joe Walsh's tribute to sobriety, and the two songs featuring Timothy B. Schmidt - \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\" and \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\". <br /> <br />Get this for many hours of enjoyable listening and viewing.

B00005JMAH|4.0|I put this review off for a long time because I wanted to re-read the book before offering final judgment on the movie.  I have to admit that I cannot add my name to the supposed list of people hailing Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n as the perfect director for this pivotal film in the Harry Potter series.  It is natural that a new director would make changes to redefine the world in his own image, but I think this movie makes far too many changes - I could forgive that, but some of the additions are just, well, silly and wholly unnecessary.  J.K. Rowling herself might love the shrunken head on the Knight Bus, but I have no use for it - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is not a comedy, and it does not need the intellectual equivalent of a man doing a pratfall.  At Hogwarts, you get ghost horsemen crashing through windows and thumping into the Great Hall.  There are a number of similar additions I consider useless at best.  Why throw these things in there?  It's not like you are starting with a weak story and having to pad the film.  Did Cuaron think he needed to add a few silly scenes in order to make the film appeal to children?  As if there's a child in Western society who isn't already a rabid Harry Potter fan.  And the clothing rubs me the wrong way - rarely do you see the kids in their Hogwarts uniforms in this movie.  And speaking of Hogwarts, it looks nothing like it did in the first two films; I kept expecting Julie Andrews to come strolling over one of the hills singing The Sound of Music.  All of these needless changes took away from my enjoyment of Rowling's story.  The fact that the kids are outgrowing their characters didn't help either - Neville, Malfoy, and, to some degree, Ron hardly resemble themselves from the first two movies.  I didn't like the fact that Dumbledore's attire was completely changed (and that little rubber band in the beard thing was - to me - horrible) - in my opinion, all of that added unneeded complications to the transition process from the late Richard Harris to Michael Gambon in this pivotal role.<br /><br />I'm not saying Cuar&oacute;n didn't do some things well, though.  The guys and gals who designed Buckbeak (in both model and CGI form) went well beyond the call of duty and should be praised.  Aunt Marge, Professor Trelawney, Professor Lupin, and Sirius Black were perfect embodiments of their literary selves.  Hogsmeade was an unqualified visual success.  The Dementors were brought to life very effectively.  Definitely, in many ways this was a very impressive film.  Notice I haven't mentioned the story yet.<br /><br />Ah, yes, the plot.  Obviously, I think the movie left out more than it should have to make room for a lot of unnecessary fluff.  What we do have, though, feels somewhat disjointed to me - just a bunch of scenes thrown together.  Obviously, I knew when the seasons changed as Cuaron went to the well too often with the soaring seasonal transitions, but I did not get the sense that a school year at Hogwarts had passed by the end of the film.  Speaking of the ending, I will declare that it was well done indeed.  It could have been confusing for younger viewers (assuming, of course, there might actually be one young viewer out there who hadn't actually read the book before seeing the film), so I was glad to see Cuaron really take the time to concentrate on bringing it off as seamlessly as possible.<br /><br />The extras on the bonus DVD are something of a mixed bag.  I think I speak for all of us when I thank the studio for not making us go through some kind of infernal maze just to find a deleted scene.  The five deleted scenes included here, though, aren't much to talk about.  The games and the tours of Honeydukes and Lupin's classroom will appeal to some, but the real meat of the extras comes in the form of the cast interviews (even though they do force us to endure more of that infernal shrunken head), the featurette on the extraordinary animals seen in the film, and the interviews with director Cuaron and author J.K. Rowling.<br /><br />I know I've been critical of the film, but that doesn't mean I don't love it.  I just think it could have been much better than it was.  Many of us take our Harry Potter extremely seriously, and I just would have preferred stricter adherence to Rowling's original story (and, of course, less silly fluff).ws with director Cuaron and author J.K.

0393035158|1.0|Religion is a problem. Not just fanatical religion, but even, perhaps especially \\"moderate religion.\\" That's Sam Harris' thesis in his New York Times bestseller, The End of Faith. And Sam Harris is a very angry man. <br /> <br />Neuroscientist Harris believes that the only legitimate reading of ancient Western religious texts (Hebrew, Christian and Muslim) is literalistic, and that, since moderates don't have a literalist hermeneutic, they are part of religious problem. Further, since moderates are open to the thought that other religious paths may contain truth, they are not just lousy theologians, but responsible for faith-based terrorism to boot. No wonder he was interviewed on Fox. <br /> <br /> He spends a good portion of this rambling book trying to show that the Bible is full of myths, self-contradictions and justification for the killing of people whose religion differs from Judaism or Christianity. He covers the same old tired ground that every modernist scholar has plowed ad nauseum for the past two centuries. He thinks we don't know this stuff. And don't be fooled by the eighty-odd pages of notes that try to lend this poorly written book the weight of philosophical gravitas. His notes are as rambling as the book, and do little to support his thesis.  <br /> <br />All Harris succeeds in doing is convincing us that Tillich was right: faith can be idolatrous. He fails to engage the most basic of questions: what exactly is wrong with a post-modernist faith? Even evangelical seminaries long ago made peace with the human nature of the Biblical text. The nature of revelatory religious faith demands the corrective lens of critical reasoning. That lens in no way renders God or faith invalid.  <br /> <br />Harris' book is really an excuse justify his hatred of Muslims, by asserting that all Muslims believe in jihad as a literal war against other religions. So he spends page after page demonstrating that, like the Hebrew Scriptures that preceded it, the Koran advocates killing other people in God's name. What he does not do is engage the universalism of Judaism, the prophetic tradition, or the radically egalitarian message of Jesus. If Harris is right, then the evolution of Jewish and Christian thought away from the notion of divinely sanctioned genocide towards a vision of justice and shalom should not have occurred. However, it did, and modern Jews and Christians do not believe that killing Muslims is morally right. Okay, moderate Jews and Christians.  <br /> <br />But Harris does believe that genocide is morally acceptable. In fact, his \\"solution\\" to the crisis in Islam is to kill every Muslim on the face of the planet. In fact, he would extend his final solution to anyone whose doesn't share his vision of an atheistic \\"moral community.\\" Some beliefs, he writes with a perfectly straight face, \\" are so dangerous that is may even be ethical to kill people for believing them.\\" One assumes that includes anybody who disagrees with Harris' Atheist Inquisitors. Like me. <br /> <br />The only religion to escape Harris' wrath is Jainism, whose founder, Vardhamana (a.k.a. Mahavira, \\"The Great Hero\\") was born in 550 BCE and attained enlightenment after 13 years of self-deprivation. In 420 BCE, he committed salekhana, fasting to death. Jina's claim to have conquered love and hate, pleasure and pain, attachment and aversion, and has thereby freed their souls from the karmas obscuring knowledge, perception, truth, and ability. It sounds pretty reasonable to me, but then I'm a follower of that weird Jew-boy from Nazareth and thus no expert on what constitutes a valid religious philosophy. Maybe I need to fast myself to death. <br /> <br />Harris' rant could be easily dismissed as the ravings of a publicity-starved madman, if it wasn't that so many people were reading this book. If this is the best that atheism can do to demolish faith, then we people of faith have nothing to worry about.  <br />
B00000I8UF|5.0|Why do all the greats die so young?  Perhaps they wouldn't have produced such quality solos in so short a time if they somehow knew they were going to live longer.  I got this CD just to hear Lee's dialogue at the beginning, and it was still worth it.  Lee had such an original concept of soloing that the listener can really feel his emotions.  I can listen to his solo on Moanin' 1000 times and never grow tired.  Melodic, arrogant, mellow and bluesy all at the same time.  Great recording!

0553573403|5.0|Right off the bat I'm going to be very blunt: I think most fantasy novels are junk. They're formulaic, repetitive, weak in character development, and present the world in black and white. They belong in the same boat as romance novels in many ways. But there are the rare exceptions to that rule and \\"The Game of Thrones\\" is proof positive of that. This is simply an excellent novel and I am completely hooked! The characters are very well defined and interesting, especially Eddard Stark, Tyrion Bannister, and Jon Snow; the plot is exciting and complex and full of intrigue; the atmosphere is violent and nitty gritty; and the author's writing is terrific. In many ways this feels more like a historical fiction novel than a swords and sorcery epic. What I loved is that you're never quite sure who's playing who for a fool. Many of the characters make foolish (but very human) mistakes along the way, and there are scenes that are truly scary, other scenes that are fascinatingly bizarre, and others that are almost profound. Magic is not in abundance in this novel, which was unexpected. It exists in a state similar to the Force in the Star Wars movies: mysterious, and below the surface, with only a few people capable of tapping into it.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't recommend this novel enough. I recommend it to fantasy junkies, historical fiction addicts (like myself), and anyone that enjoys a good story with a labyrinthine plot and great characters. My stereotyping of fantasy novels has ended and I can't wait to start the next one!
0783244320|5.0|I already had a copy of Galaxy Quest in my collection of DVDs, but when my son informed me there was a DTS version, I had to have that as well.  The movie is good enough to warrant the extra copy, and I have actually lost count how many times I have enjoyed this film since I first purchased the regular version.  Good clean fun and good acting all around.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica.  Once brought up into a conversation, two things pop into a mans mind.  One of a historically important Thrash band, that made an impact upon almost anybody who cared to listen, and a historically important band that practically changed their name to Nutallica and also practically sold their souls for money.  Both of these are true, but the first is so fresh and original and important that to this very day, we still love these songs.  The true Metallica last from 1983 till 1991 at best.  Although there are only 8 songs here, they are all of a decently long length and are all so beautiful that you never want them to end.  This was Metallica, not the Metallica of today with 6 minute songs containing stupid lyrics, a trash can and no solos.  After the Black album pay no attention to them,  you'll only be disappointed, but back to this album.  Kill `em All was the beginning of Metallica, and here on their second album, they show growth and maturity as they write more important thing instead of Hit the lights or Whiplash (great songs but not important lyrically speaking).  Almost all of these songs are about Death.  Not death in the sense of Cannibal Corpse's Hammer Smashed Face, but more so in that that each is about a different issue, and makes a point and has something important to say.  With a short break down I'll show what I mean.   <br /> <br />1. Fight Fire with Fire 10/10: one of the best and fastest metallica songs in my opinion.  This one is about Nuclear Warfare <br />2. Ride the Lightning 10/10: Beautiful solos, a song that you'll be happy to have stuck in your head.  This one is about the Electric Chair.   <br />3. For Whom the Bell Tolls 10/10: slower, but one of the most important tracks here.  It's about the Spanish Civil war and also has something to do with H.P. Lovecraft, an author whom Kirk has a fascination with.   <br />4. Fade to Black 9/10: a friend of mine finds this to be relatively boring.  In my opinion you need to be in the rightmood for this song.  But when you are in the mood, this song rocks.  It is about Suicide, and from what I understand this song was also controversial because a man killed himself while listening to it back in the 80's.   <br />5. Trapped Under Ice 8/10: Great song, the solos are great, the atmosphere is great.  It's about, well, being trapped under ice.   <br />6. Escape 8/10: the only song not about death, more so about escaping from a town that wants you to be a certain way, and therefore rebelling.  Remember, 8/10 still means good, it's just that track 1-4 are classics.   <br />7. Creeping Death 9/10: It's told through the eyes of the Grim Reaper.  An all around great song.  I love the middle part.   <br />8. The Call of Ktulu 10/10: A beautiful instrumental, once again about an H.P. lovecraft story. I actually read this one and it's a good read, very strange.  In my opinion, this is far better than Orion from Master of Puppets, but that's just my opinion.   <br /> <br />There is something about Ride the Lightning that I can not explain with any other record.  It has this strange dusty feeling to it.  When glancing at a copy of it, it appears to be rather old and unused (even a brand new copy).  Popping it into a CD player, the production has this weird dusty feeling to it that has the same feeling.  But when listening to it, it seems like a gem or relic that one has discovered in the attic of an old house.  It has this mystic atmosphere to it that can not be replicated or understood really.  James's voice also has a rough edge to it as well that isn't on other Metallica records.  This is my favorite Metallica record, as I can listen to it from start to finish and NEVER become bored at all.  Anyone who likes metal should have some Metallica in their collection.  I don't consider them to be the best metal band in history, (as a matter of fact I don't give that title to any band) but this is a valuable history lesson from the world of thrash.  Metallica were once great, people listened to metallica for those beautiful solos, for the touching and fun lyrics and song meanings.  But if you want a great drummer than look elsewhere because Lars is easily disposable, and I could name [insert any number here] of drummers that are better than him.  Lars just does enough to get by but he'll still have his moments of talent, though in this present day, I don't think there is a single person who doesn't want to just punch him in the face.  Well enough about this album, just find it, get it in your collection and enjoy.  Hoped this helped.   <br />
0425152251|1.0|I had to read this book for a summer assignment and found it to be terrible. It's a textbook hiding in a novel, but not very well. It's boring and extremeley monotonous. If it was shortened by 200 pages it would be an okay read. It's biased around Christianity and the characters are unrealistic. A real 15 year old girl would not be interested and influenced by an annonymous philosophy course. If you have a passion for philosophy go ahead and read it but otherwise I think you will be unpleasently surprised.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|The plot of \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" isn't overly complicated, but somehow its director, Baz Luhrmann, managed to make the kind of movie that leaves you smiling, and wanting to watch it again. This film doesn't give you a lot of food for thought, but it is pure unadulterated fun, and that is a lot :)<br /><br />The main character is Scott (Paul Mercurio), a ballroom dancer who is tired of the steps that others taught him, and wants to dance his own steps. Due to that, and to the fact that he starts to do exactly that in a championship without talking about it with his partner, Liz (Gia Carides), she leaves him. For Liz, the matter is simple: she wants to win, and Scott's new steps aren't the way to do so. The president of the Australian Dance Federation, Barry Fife (Bill Hunter), expresses the situation quite well when he says that \\"Well, of course, you can dance any steps you like! But that doesn't mean you'll...win\\".<br /><br />It is after that chaotic and interesting beginning to the film that the try-outs for Scott's new couple begin, the \\"judges\\" being his extremely emotional mother (Pat Thompson) and his ballroom dancing professor (Peter Whitford), both professional ballroom dancers in the past. Unknown to them, though, Scott discovers in Fran (Tara Morice), a frequently overlooked woman who is merely a beginner with lots of spunk, the person who he wants to dance with, even if he has to teach her himself. After all, Fran's motto, \\"A life lived in fear is a life half lived\\", goes well with Scott's philosophy that is dancing that matters, not winning.<br /><br />All in all, I can sincerely say that I loved this movie, and that I deeply regret missing it in 1992, when it was released... Truth to be told, \\"Strictly ballroom\\" isn't overly popular here in Argentina, and it is rather difficult to find a copy to rent. Fortunately, and thanks to the recommendation of a friend and a new videostore, I could watch it today. I enjoyed the story, the music and the great performances given by the actors, as well as the wonderful ending that allowed me to keep on smiling after a while even after finishing the movie. Of course, I highly recommend this movie to you!.<br /><br />Belen Alcatperformances given by the actors, as well as the wonderful ending that allowed me to keep on smiling after a while even after finishing the movie.

B0002DB52M|4.0|Dogville is a movie that will disappoint most conventional viewers--I myself came close to turning it off a few times.  There are a number of reasons for this:  its more like a play than a movie (the \\"set\\" is really a stage), its extremely long (nearly 3 hours), its heavy on dialog but lite on action, the plot unfolds at the same rate that grass grows, and it doesn't fit into any traditional movie genre.  However, if you can wade through all that, you'll discover Dogville delivers a powerful thesis on human nature that has plenty of \\"bite\\".  The story itself is about a beautiful, fragile woman on the run (Grace) and the town that \\"befriends\\" her.  Of course, neither Grace or the town are quite what they appear to be.  Like a mean dog, the town eventually turns on the pure-hearted Grace--while she struggles to maintain her dignity and ideals. Perhaps the most pathetic character is Tom, the town's erstwhile philosopher and full-time layabout, who has professed his love for Grace (and she for he).  Despite his role as the town's moral compass, Tom stands idly by as Grace is increasingly humiliated, abused, and ultimately enslaved by his fellow townsfolk--so much for true love.  As the movie reaches its climax, Grace suffers a final betrayal at Tom's hands and the town is exposed for what it is (the transparency of the set itself helps reinforce this point).  With her faith in the goodness of humanity gone, Grace ends up embracing what she once shunned.  Will Dogville survive?  And should it?  The ending is appalling, yet satisfying from both a cinematic and emotional standpoint, and a James Caan cameo provides the icing on the cake.  If you want to see a movie that showcases the best & worst of human nature, I highly recommend Dogville.
B00005MP58|5.0|I love this version of Pride and Prejudice and I totally fell in love with Mr. Darcy and Miss Elizabeth. <br /> <br />I love it so much so that I borrowed the set from the local library and watched the entire thing in two days (because I couldn't stand to turn it off until Mr. Darcy and Lizzy got it together).  <br /> <br />
B00092QTL8|4.0|There's no question about it - this album has finally brought about the return of the old school Oasis that many of us grew up loving.  It's an album that gives the brothers Gallagher a reason for the swagger in their steps.  The extra tracks on this album are superb, although I'm not sure that $50 is the most reasonable price. <br /> <br />5 stars for quality minus 1 star for price = 4 stars
B00025ETIW|5.0|For those of you, (ahem) like Tom sErvo \\"robot\\" or whoever the hell you are, who think that MCR is a band  \\" who obsess over fashion instead of substance in their music, will not be around very long\\">you are sadly mistaken. You people bitch and complain about originality and talent that's lacking in music, but really, MCR lyrics must be too profound for your small little minds to grasp then, right? MCR lyrics are deep,symbolic, and very ominous. I picked up this cd after listening to the second single \\"Helena\\" and I have not stopped listening to it. MCR's music style has hints of punk, metal, cabaret style intro's (Track #4).  <br />                     1.Helena-Very indepth, melodious, written about Way's late grandmother. MY absolute favorite. It speaks to the listener.5 out of 5++ <br />                     2.Give 'em hell kid-Intro's very fast,loud, then becomes very punk-poppy.Not one of my favorites. 1 out of 5. <br />                     3. To the End-One of my faves. I love the opening lyrics, very creepy. \\"He calls the mansion not a house but a tomb, he's always choking from the stench and the fume...\\" It rocks hard. I love it. 5 out of 5. <br />                     4. You know what they do to guys like us   <br />                     in prison?-Has a cabaret style intro with the piano, very eccentric intro, good lyrics \\"I won't go down by myself but I'll go down with my friends\\" good screaming, and the laugh at the end adds a twist. 5 out of 5. <br />                      5. I'm Not Okay (I promise)-Very punk poppy. Has a me against the world theme. Reminds me of high school 2 out of 5. <br />                       6. Ghost of You-Despite what others say, this song is very heartbreaking, and I listen to all the time. Very romeo and juliet.  <br />                3 out of 5. <br />                      7. The jetset life is gonna kill you-Love this song, love the first few lines \\"Gaze into her killing jar...\\" very twisted, dark. Way is very heartfelt here.5 out of 5. <br />                       8.Interlude. <br />                         <br />                       9. Thank You for the Venom-Rox the hardest here! It really does. I just rock out when I hear this. Way's vocals are all over the place here, but I love it! 5 out of 5.  <br /> <br />*THE NEXT 3 SONGS I REALLY DON'T LIKE, ESPECIALLY TRACK 10, SO I WILL NOT WRITE ANYTHING FOR THEM.  <br /> <br />To the rest of you who don't like them, please expand your tiny horizons regardless of what others will think.  <br />
0312323859|5.0|I didn't read Emily Giffin's first novel, Something Borrowed. However, the plus side to that literary lapse in judgment is that I wasn't familiar with the characters in Something Blue and therefore had no reason to feel disappointed that the book was written from the point of view of bad girl Darcy.  <br /> <br />Quite frankly, I enjoyed Darcy's spunk and respected her decision to make peace with being a self-involved and shallow human being. Darcy's innumerable dastardly deeds kept me turning pages. But when she ends up pregnant and rejected by the father of the child as well as her former friends, Darcy has to hatch a new plan if she expects to continue to live the fabulous life. After licking her wounds, she high-tails it out of New York and is off to London to live with Ethan, a childhood friend who had the audacity to give her the brush off back in grade school. Gracing him with her indefinite presence in his apartment should give Ethan ample time to correct the error of his ways. <br /> <br />But Ethan isn't the push-over Darcy had expected him to be and he has no patience for her narcissistic tendencies. With Ethan's insistance that Darcy view life from a more mature perspective, she's forced to mend her ways as she prepares for motherhood. <br /> <br />This is one of the best chic lit books I've ever read. I plan to back track and pick up Something Borrowed ASAP.
B00005BL2A|5.0|Some people, I'm  sure many, have complained about this album. I don't see anything to complain about. I have three of their albums and even \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" on The Wedding Singer album. This group, like some other groups such as U2 and singers <br />like David Bowie, have changed their style over the years. This can be a good thing, though I tend to like the older stuff. But, like I said, I have no complaints. I absolutely love Depeche Mode, and will continue to love them no matter what anyone says about them. Breathe was clever, in that the song used biblical names and managed to make it rhyme nicely. Dream On was the first one I heard which is why I wanted it. It has wonderful material and a beautiful end song Goodnight Lovers. The Dead of Night (from what I gathered) was about a bunch of young punks who used, possesed, and hung out to dry girls for their own selfish pleasure. Menacing and dark, it also evoked images of a night club where the dead hung out. Comatose was an interesting one... it actually evoked the feeling of slipping in and out of consciousness. I could go on forever but I won't, I just loved this so much. I also greatly enjoyed their earlier works, at least the ones I heard. Halo, Personal Jesus, Enjoy The Silence... ah, Violator. Good album. I also like People Are People. I don't think I ever heard the original version of Stripped. The first time I heard it was by Rammstein. I thought they did a good job on this one, but if I get a chance I'd like to hear the original. I think David Gahan has a sexy voice, and it's been criticized a lot by people who have reviewed their albums. In contrast to Gahan's (I'm never really sure who sings on what, except that David's voice is pretty unmistakable)Gore's is softer and sweeter (from what I've read). I suppose their vocals could be compaired to Anne and Nancy Wilson of Heart. Anne's voice tends to sound a little deeper and booming. Nancy, if you can pick her voice out, <br />has lovely vocals too,and I guess a little softer than her sister's and with as much passion. <br /> <br />Anyway, with that aside, I have one more thing to say. People who criticize others, particularly critics, only do so because they have no real talent of their own. (Although many people in the literary and art world have criticized each other in the past, but that's beside the point.) These kinds of people only  want to make names for themselves and see them in print or laugh about how clever they think they are.(Which is what bugs me about a lot of these radio DJs.) Instead of finding fault develop a real ability, or get a life.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I don't know what went wrong on the BET Award Show because Mariah just couldn't get it together. I know she has perfect pitch, thus I'm puzzled. But I digress. <br /> <br />The Emancipation of Mimi is evidence that that Mariah is no fluke; she's a muscial force that will be around for years to come. That she was able to create a CD that effectively combines today's hip hop and yesterday's R&B is amazing. I love every song on the CD. My favorite is Mine Again.  <br /> <br />It's a welcome change to see someone who was on a downward spiral take control of her life and continue to share and bless us with her God-given talent.

006109594X|4.0|This book was an excellent read. Undoubtedly the best of Robinson's works to date. He develops the story intelligently, carefully and with a lot of suspense, which contrasts somewhat with popular submarine novels from other authors, who tend to drown the story in techno-details and over-imaginative plots, and a lot of explosions! Through the story, we travel to some fascinating locations and meet well-developed and diverse characters. I particularly enjoyed the playful banter between Morgan and Rankin, although Morgan's is somewhat overdone in places. I heartily recommend this book to anybody What's more, the sequel, Kilo Class, is just as entertaining!

B0001ZX0PG|1.0|Like a bad episode of Law and Order, this pretentious movie flies its artsy urgency with the kind of solemnity that makes it painful to watch.   <br />I remember sitting through improvisations in high school and college drama classes where two boys would adopt accents and do a lot of cursing and bitter emoting as they worked themselves up to some kind of pathetic confrontation/revelation (all the time imagining that this was \\"real\\" and \\"true\\" and \\"art\\" because they were cursing and emoting); Eastwood's little crime melodrama has that same painful self-consciousness about it.  It feels like a bunch of unprepared actors standing around working themselves up to something they hope will startle the audience. <br /> <br />It is a sadly unworthy film --in almost every way.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay has become my favorite band of all time. I had 2 of their cds before X&Y came out and I was anxious to see if this album would be as good as the others. And, as I have found with the other cds, it took a few good listens for this cd to grow on me but I absolutly love it. It is my favorite album by them yet and I'm excited to see what they will come out with next. <br /> <br />Even though I love the whole entire album, My favorite tracks include \\"Fix You\\", \\"A message\\", \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" and \\"The hardest part\\" which stick to their normal sound. The rest of the cd is a bit more rock than usual. For those that say all of their songs sound a like, you must be close minded and maybe even deaf. This cd is more upbeat and has a new feel to it. <br /> <br />Seriously, pick up this cd and listen to it a few times and I guarantee you will love it. Coldplay beautifully blends guitar, piano, and drums on X&Y creating an original sound which just makes you feel good. I'm going to see them live in September and I cannot wait.
0060755598|4.0|This book covers a broad range of information related to the development of a small business and the pitfalls that await... <br /> <br />Lots of pointers and lots of valuable information.  As a small business Owner of 7 years, there was still lots of invaluable information for me in this publication.   It also seems to apply to any business sector, although I was at first dubious that it could apply to my business... it is a concept not a hard and fast book of rules. <br /> <br />The greatest lesson taught is that you should actively create the life you want, not live around the life that you lead.  In order to be considered a sucessful entrepeneur your business should not be a new job, but the means to allow you to do the things that you want to do...  a hard lesson to learn for a workaholic.
B000002J09|5.0|Why even bother reviewing this album, right? Every metalhead has done it already. Twice.   Some people write about how awful and overrated it is, mostly just to be noticed, apparently, and I'm not a fanatical Zeppelin-fan myself (don't even own all of their albums - gasp!), but to me this is one classic rock record which actually is every bit as great as it is made out to be.     By no means heavy metal, this is a superb mix of blues, folk and rock, and even as famous as \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" is, it actually doesn't overshadow the rest of the album as much as you would think. Which just shows you how magnificent \\"Atlantic Records #LC0121\\" really is.   (It has no title, remember? It was never meant to be called \\"IV\\" or \\"Led Zeppelin\\", and certainly not \\"ZOSO\\"...it simply had no title other than the catalogue number.)     \\"Black Dog\\" is a terrific blues number with a crunching riff, \\"Rock And Roll\\" does just that, and the Lord of The Rings-homage \\"The Battle Of Evermore\\" is a lovely, folkish piece ringing with mandolins which sees Plant performing a duet with singer Sandy Denny, the bell-clear soprano from the Fairport Convention.   And the first side (of the original LP) closes with the eight-minute \\"Stairway To Heaven\\". I guess you know that one.     The second side opens with \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", which may sound kind of silly. It's a nice, bluesy tune, though, with pounding drums and a funky bass riff, and it is followed by \\"Four Sticks\\", another bluesy rocker, and not at all bad, even though it's probably the least interesting track on the album, sporting a somewhat monotonous riff.   \\"Going To California\\" is an acoustic folk ballad, which sounds traditional enough to be a rip-off, but which is credited to Page and Plant (not that that proves anything!). It is a nice, lilting tune.   And then the album finally winds down with a blues, the epic \\"When The Levee Breaks\\". Plant plays great blues harmonica, the drums roll like thunder, and \\"Levee\\" is the one song to truly rival \\"Stairway To Heaven\\". At once majestic and frightening, it ends the untitled one on a high note.     So few \\"classic\\" albums really live up to that tag, but this one surely does. Go get it if you haven't already.
B000005RYQ|5.0|For any Police fan, this album contains the essential hits! It is a must for any collection.  It reminds me of when Sting wrote music that was cutting edge, rather than adult contemporary! Now, if only the Police got together again for a reunion.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The Bends was the first radiohead album that I listened to. Planet Telex mesmerised me, and then I found Street Spirit....  <br />      But I admit the first time I heard OK Computer I was at a loss; what had they done? But my advice is to be patient. After a few times through you will never look back. Never has an album intrigued, stunned and played with my emotions more than OK Computer. In my eyes it is second to nothing; each track will take you on a unique journey. Listen with an open mind and give this album a chance; don't dismiss it after one track. You won't regret it I promise you.
B00080ZG1A|4.0|The Aviator inspired me to order the biography of Howard Hughes on Amazon (The Amazing Howard Hughes).  Hats off to DiCaprio who gave an authentic performance to the real Howard.  An extraordinary man of romantic and engineering proportions, he revolutionized modern aeronautics by day, and romanced Hollywood starlets by night.  Howard never missed a beat!  The movie syncronizes to the stories in the biography, so you'll get the real story. <br />For those looking for lots of aeronautical action and Hollywood glitz, this movie delivers on all fronts.  Buckle up and enjoy your flight!!
B00001OH7X|3.0|David Bowies Lodger is a very uneasy and unsetteling album. Lodger isnt acessable in any since, which isnt a surprize as it is David Bowie! Through Bowies carear he created many a good rock album, case in point Ziggy Stardust, Man Who Sold The World, Station To Station, but this album falls short of even being called great. While decent, you grow to expect more from an artist of David Bowies calaber.<br /><br />Lodger is an album full of new wave sounds and strange experiments, really before it's time. The album opens with 'Fantastic Voyage' which features nice vocals and great lyrics, but it's not a very good song, and really not the song to open the album with thats for sure! 'African Fight Night' is a strange song that along with the opener isnt that good the only difference is the opener has good lyrics! 'Move On' is a good song, the first one on the album. It's very space age-ish, and sounds almost like it could have done well on Scary Monsters. The song features haunting vocals which add a nice touch. 'Yassasin' is another strange song and while it's not an amazing song it is still pretty cool, I actually like this song it shows Bowie has no fear of experimenting with sounds. 'Red Sails' is probabley the best song on the album. It's easily my favorite song here. Next is the hit single, 'D.J' is a anthemtic rock song that did well for Bowie on the charts. 'D.J' is one of the better songs on the album. 'Look back In Anger' is a killer song with powerfull vocals and excelent lyrics. Bowie often opens his shows with this song, it has since become a Bowie classic. 'Boys Keep Swinging' is one of my all time favorite David Bowie songs and is a pure Bowie classic in all since of the terms! Classic video featuring Bowie in drag, what a surprize, huh?  'Boys Keep Swinging' is one of Bowies all time best songs. 'Repetition' is a great song as well showing great guitar playing and very laid back vocals give this song a nice sound. The album ends with 'Red Money' which is really cool, anyone who has heard the song knows this, it is the very best pick to close the album. I really dig this song and wish Bowie made more like it. The song features some really cool guitar playing!<br /><br />While Lodger isnt David Bowies best album it isnt his worst either. Yes I do think Bowie could have dont much better on this album I thnk most fans are in agreement with me on that one but one listen to this album will tell you he was capable of much more. So with all that said and in mind this isnt a bad album and is actually good for a spin every now and then. I'm not sure who to recomend this album to because it is open for interatation but obviously all Bowie fans should own it as it has a couple unforgettable classics.ool, anyone who has heard the song knows this, it is the very best pick to close the album. I really dig this song and wish Bowie made more like it. The song features some really cool guitar playing!    While Lodger isnt David Bowies best album it isnt his worst either.

B000062X90|4.0|Argus is considered to be Wishbone Ash best album. <br />It's their third album and it was released on April 1972. <br />It's a rock album with touches of progresive music. <br />There are 7 good long songs + 3 bonus tracks from \\"Live from Memphis\\". <br />The first song \\"Time is\\" starts very slowly and then changes to powerful rock. The second song \\"Sometime world\\" has a lovely guitar solo. <br />\\"Warrior\\" and \\"Throw down the sword\\" end the album with very intense strong music. <br />When listenning to the music I thought about the \\"Who\\".  <br />The disc is remastered and the quality of the music is amazing. <br />The bonus tracks are \\" \\"jail Bait\\", \\"The Pilgrim\\", \\"Phoenix\\". <br />They are long pieces, very well played and are very worthwhile.
B0007PALRU|5.0|I really liked this movie, and I really don't get it why several people are writing such negative reviews. <br /> <br />I thought that the special effects were top-notch. <br />The story is interesting and pretty good. <br />The acting is also good. <br /> <br />My recommendation: This is a great movie to watch. And if you have a large widescreen TV, then you are really going to have a great time.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I LIKE THIS CD, BUT THE PLACEMENT OF THE SONGS ISNT REALLY MY STYLE... <br />SOME OF THE SONGS TEND TO BLEND TOGETHER, MOVING FROM SLOW TO FAST, AND BACK TO SLOW... <br />SONGS TO WATCH FOR ON THIS ALBUM ARE 7 NATION ARMY, THE HARDEST BUTTON TO BUTTON, BALL & BISCUIT, AND YOU HAVE NO FAITH IN MEDICINE... <br />OVERALL, A GOOD CHOICE IF IT'S IN THE BARGAIN BIN, BUT I DOUBT THEIR BEST WORK... <br />-CHRIS-
B0000029GA|3.0|this cd is better than an average rap album but nothing special. It only has 10 songs and half of them are good and half are fillers. Nas might have the most boring voice out of all the mainstream rappers, if you want to fall to sleep listen to this album and listen to the crappy beats from the so called amazing producers. The only reason this gets 3 stars is cuz nas does have awesome lyrics but that is all he does have in this forgettable cd.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Overall: I have been a fan of Coldplay ever since their second CD (\\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\") and after having listened to all three of their CDs (plus their live stuff) I find this CD to be pretty good for Coldplay. Coldplay, however, has higher standards then some other bands and therefore this CD is simply delightful when compared to some other music. After their third album with great songs they have proven themselves as a great band. <br /> <br />  Below I have rated the first 6 tracks, the numbering is unique on this CD, it consists of X1-X6, Y1-Y6 and + (13 tracks in all): <br />   X1. \\"Square One\\" 4 of 5 - Although this song may start off wierd, as soon as the drums come in I could tell it was going to be a great song. The chorus is a psychedelic mixture of guitar riffs, piano sounds and Chris Martin's signiture vocals. The contrast between the verse and the chorus creates an altogether great song. <br />   X2. \\"What If\\" 5 of 5 - A great piano song, reminiscent of \\"Everything's Not Lost\\" (from \\"Parachutes\\"). The lyrics are full of hypotheticals (most containing \\"what if...\\"). This is a nice laid back song that I find myself humming the chorus of this song quite often. I rate this one of the best songs on \\"X&Y\\". <br />   X3. \\"White Shadows\\" 3 of 5 - This is a nice song but not the best. It is very similar to a Franz Ferdinand song. I am not very fond of the guitar riff that enters in the second verse as it conflicts with the vocals. But I do like the deep vocals in the chorus (\\"Maybe you get what you wanted/Maybe you stumble upon it\\"). Overall I enjoy this compisition, but it is one of the songs that I pass over occasionally while listening to the album. <br />   X4. \\"Fix You\\" 5 of 5 - A good song, Chris Martin's voice sits well with the begining organs. Then instruments slowly join in as the song progresses, including piano, strings, guitar and drums. By the time the electric guitar and drums join in, the song has been built up to a masterpiece. The fullness and clarity of the instruments can be heard. Then the song gets quiet for the ending, giving it the rise and fall of an incredible song. <br />   X5. \\"Talk\\" 3 of 5 - A nice song, that \\"contains elements of Kraftwerk's 'Computer Love'\\" (as the booklet puts it). The strumming of the electric guitar makes a cool sound which combines with a Coldplay-esque riff to create a decent sound. I do not like some of the guitar as it is very repetative and as we all know familiarity breeds contempt. Overall I find I don't enjoy listening to this song as much as the other songs. <br />   X6. \\"X&Y\\" 4 of 5 - This song lives up to its expectations as the title track. A good song showing off the vocal talents of Chris and a nice psyedelic, slow guitar solo that is typical of Coldplay. Although it starts with only strings it builds up to a full orchestra of instruments before it suddenly reverts back to only violins, much like the middle of the Beatles' \\"I Am the Walrus\\". Again this displays their musical talents and has an overall good sound. <br /> <br />  I would rate the others but I don't have alot of time so I'll just give you my recommendations: <br />   Y1. \\"Speed of Sound\\" 5 of 5 (I enjoyed the music video as well) <br />   Y2. \\"A Message\\" 4 of 5 (Good acoustic song to play) <br />   Y4. \\"The Hardest Part\\" 5 of 5 (My favorite song) <br />   Y5. \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" 5 of 5 (Great Coldplay song) <br />   +.  \\"'Til Kingdom Come\\" 4 of 5 (Good Acoustic song) <br /> <br />  I would recommend this CD to anyone who liked Coldplay's other CDs or even just the songs that they've heard around. This album does not have any pimped out rapperz with vulgar profanities, and therefore should not be recommended to people who are searching for such music. This is my first review and I hope you all found it helpful.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This is the kind of movie that's fun to watch as long as you are not going to analyze it for depth later. Yes, it's sachrine--the ending is artificially sweet. But, it's thoroughly enjoyable. <br /> <br />For me, the most-notable and weirdest thing about the movie is the lack of consistency. Is this reality or fantasy? Some of the stories seem grounded in reality. The relationship between Thompson and Rickman's characters, for example. Others are pure fantasy, such as the gorgeous available women in midwestern bars just waiting for a Brit to show up. That both of these storylines make it into the same movie (and end at the same location) is just weird.
0385338686|4.0|I had fun reading this wonderful romantic comedy.  Having read the Shopaholic books and Can You Keep a Secret?, I looked forward to reading the newest Sophie Kinsella romp called The Undomestic Goddess.  The Undomestic Goddess, like all of her previous books, is full of laughs and goofy situations that make you not want to put the book down.  Samantha Sweeting is one of best bank lawyers in London.  She is fast, efficient and has no time to rest because her working schedule is counted in six minute segments.  She lives and breathes work, especially now that she may become the youngest partner at the law firm of Carter Spink.  But then disaster strikes.  She finds a memo on her messy desk and discovers that she has missed an important deadline -- a deadline that costs her law firm fifty million pounds.  Panicked, Samantha walks out of her office, gets on a train and arrives at the countryside.  One thing leads to another and she somehow ends up working as a housekeeper for an eccentric couple.  They have no idea that Samantha is a lawyer with an IQ of 158 and she has no idea how to cook, clean, iron clothes or even sew a button.  As she tries to learn how to use the washing machine, she tries to clear her name at the firm.  She sees her domestic new job as a temporary solution while she figures things out, but then she meets Nathaniel, the cute gardener, and things get all the more complicated.  There are some fun twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />The scenes in which Samantha tries to learn what to do around the house are hilarious!  Housekeeping is obviously not her thing.  Despite the amusing situations, the story is quite unrealistic and you have to suspend disbelief in several scenes in this novel.  Samantha is intelligent and efficient when she works as a lawyer, but is quite dense in her housekeeping job.  The characters are great.  Nathaniel is quite sweet and I can see why she is taken by his charms.  Eddie and Trish, her domestic employers, are patronizing and annoying most of the time, but their intentions are noble in some occasions.  Her lawyer colleagues, namely Guy, are one-dimensional workaholics that angered me throughout the book.  The aforementioned traits are deliberate in the story, of course.  All in all, The Undomestic Goddess is a cute, fun Cinderella story in reverse, a riches to rags of sorts.  This isn't Kinsella's best offering, the Shopaholic novels are still my favorites, but this is a great summer read that you can sink your teeth into.  I highly recommend it.zing and annoying most of the time, but their intentions are noble in some occasions.

6305807086|5.0|Being John Malkovich explores true human despair. It doesn't waste time criticizing commercialism or politics solely because they exist. It doesn't pile the blame of a man's misery on education of bad parenting. It understands that misery is part of human nature. People are gifted and burdened with consciousness, as Craig Swartz confides in his wife's pet chimp. Despair doesn't stem from society or any social institution, but from the mind of the individual. I see someone else laugh, I think, \\"Why aren't I that happy?\\" Someone else has money, \\"How come I'm not rich?\\" <br /> <br />Human nature is to look toward the future to something grander than we can really achieve. People are dreamers. We can't be happy with ourselves so we strive to be someone else. <br /> <br />Being John Malcovich explores this dilemma with hilarity, grace, and intelligence. I provides miserable people the possibility to be someone else, if only for a short while. But the cost is great. <br /> <br />To truly become someone elseone has to give up who he is, and no matter how burdensome consciousness is, we value it more than anything. Plus it's a $200 service charge. <br /> <br />This combination of the practical and the metaphysical sets Malkovich apart from other Theater of the Absurd works, placing it among the greatest films of all time. It's a true masterpiece of not only the human condition, but of human behavior. <br /> <br />When a husband and wife fall for the same woman, they engage in horrific conflict. Not because the other has been unfaithful, but because the other is a threat to the extramarital relationship. Maxine is the perfect seductress to bring out this situation not because she has the erotic charm of the femme fatale, but because she's attractive and enjoys it. Despite her beauty, she remains down to Earth. She might mislead, but she is never entirely dishonest. <br /> <br />John Malkovich gives the greatest performance of his carreer as a man fighting for his very soul.You might be thinking, \\"Big deal, he's playing himself.\\" Wrong! Not only is his character a fictional charicature held in the public's mind, he also plays Craig and Lester. And he captures them perfectly. Name me one other actor who can shout, \\"Shut up!!!You overrated sack of sh*t,\\" at himself and pull it off with grace and realism. Thought not.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds is arguably the finest pop album of all-time because of its ability to express deeply personal feelings of a very confused but brilliant man (Brian Wilson) through a wide range of musical sounds and the classic Beach Boy harmonies. No pop album since has been able to deliver such intimate feelings. The songs are by themselves quite simple but made unique by the music. As always (though) its the Beach Boy vocals that carry the day in classics like \\"God Only Knows\\" \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and \\"You Still Believe In Me\\".
B00005JKGO|5.0|A statue of Jesus Christ soars over the ruins of ancient Rome. Children clamber after it as it passes over the slums of madern Rome. The helicopter that carries it stops hovered over a hotel so the passenger can chat with some of the lovely ladies poolside. <br /> <br />Not since Pulp Fiction have I been so captivated by the opening frames of a film. This scene sets the stage for a world not unlike our own, a world of images that is under the constant watch of the God who made it and the voyeurous paparazzis who pollute it. <br /> <br />Marcello is one such photojournalist, yet even his life is not free from the vulgar invasions he commits. He is plagued by an unstoppable sex drive. He can get women anywhere but has no interest in keeping them. This might sound cliched, but this movie is one of the most original films I've ever seen. What sets it apart is the fact that when with a woman, he is truly, deeply in love...for about three days. His weakness is represented by the many terrific symbolic images in the film. <br /> <br />The movie starlet Sylvia he'd fallen for one particular evening basks underneath an arificial waterfall. She comments on the beauty of the sounds it makes and calls Marcello to join her. He does, but only after removing his shoes that he may be entirely comfortable in the wet. He comes to her, reaches out, and...the water stops flowing, the sound is gone. <br /> <br />Photographers clamber for the best angles and the most shots as the two come home to meet Sylvia's boyfriend. They continue snapping pictures as the boyfriend beats the two. They even go as far as egging them on. <br /> <br />The photojournalists continue leeching virtue from conflicts throughout the film. They are never at peace. The only character to have a stable life is Steiner. He's a friend of Marcello, but they never see each other. Steiner lives a peaceful life, and Marcello envies that. Steiner, however, can't stand it. He has a wife and two beautiful children whom he loves, but he feels trapped by his high place in society. Peace is his greatest horror. After confiding this to Marcello, he kisses his children goodnight and laments for how happy he is. We see him one more time in the film, but under very different circumstances. <br /> <br />The film ends with the capture of a giant stingray. Fish have no eyelids so, as Marcello points out, it is always watching even after its dead. A woman calls for him from across a small channel, he tries to make out what she's saying, but the water and the distance make it impossible. In the end he just walks away. <br /> <br />In the stingray, Marcello saw a reflection of himself. He's a giant of personality and a powerful figure. He always watches, but is dead on the inside. <br /> <br />The film is a little too long, but Fellini has no trouble keeping up the energy. I'm sure that everything I wrote and everything I noted but decided not to write only scratched the surface of this amazing film. It's the type of film you have to watch more than once. I'll be sure to watch it again.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul was the first album in a chain of three Beatles masterpieces, the other two being Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's. While Rubber Soul is easily the least experimental of the three, it definitly is proof of the Beatles maturing. In fact, there are only three out-and-out experiments on the album.<br /><br />While Rubber Soul is not as experimental, it does show John and Paul growing as songwriters. Songs written like Michelle, Girl, I'm Looking Through You and In My Life would not have been seen on even their previous album (the most poppy the Beatles ever got). The aforementioned experiments are hit-and-miss. Norweigan Wood is Hindu and very good, the Word is psychadelic and is also good. What goes on is country, and stands as one of my least favorite Beatles songs. But there are a few of my favorites here, too, such as Girl, Drive My Car, In My Life, etc etc etc. Good album, buy it today.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|What can u say when u look into the gorgeous eyes of Newman and the sexy blue of Redfords and add some of the funniest dialogue between 2 friends that would DIE FOR EACH OTHER  There is not another western, drama, action-whatever catagory u want to put it in that can beat it. Ladies, you have two of the machoest men in movies along with a great script   u will love it. And I'm  not a western fan. I am a horsewoman and boy, they can sit a horse!! When Sundance asks, when his skill as a gunman is tested.  \\"Can I move?\\" (after having to shoot a coin laying about 50 feet away and failing dismally) then giving the go ahead. blasts that coin all over Bolivia,  u want him to move and enjoy every minute of this otherwise  serious man. \\"I do better when I move\\" Too many scenes to pick from but one while Butch is entwined in the arms of Cloris Leachman good old Sundance runs right over the bed and them to warn Butch the men that have been trailing them are outside.  Good thing Butch had his boots off.Watch and see why.   And guys you'll roar at how 2 Wanted Dead or Alive bandits live their lives and love it.  I know they got away, even from the entire  Bolivian army, and wish I knew how they lived out the rest of their days!! You can bet they had fun!  And your kids can watch it.
B000002J03|4.0|For those of you out there who think that John Paul Jones was the most talented member of the Zeppelin - and yes, I am one of those people - you need to listen to this album as fast as possible. The bass playing here is his best ever, I think. I'd hesitate to call the album brilliant, but it's pretty close. I want to say this is my second favorite Zeppelin album after Houses of the Holy, but as I've said in previous reviews, Zeppelin's first four albums are all more or less equally good.<br />And hey, how about those bass lines? On the dirty blues jam \\"Lemon Song\\" and the half-ballad, half-rockers \\"What is and What Should Never Be\\" (which also is Plant at his best - his vocals are sensual, and his ad-libbing during the fadeout is incredibly charismatic) and \\"Ramble On\\" (which is my favorite song on the record - melodic bass part, cool restrained drumming, great use of dynamics) have him doing his best bass playing in Zeppelin history. \\"Ramble On\\" especially. And when he's just playing in unison with Page, that's okay too, because Page's riffs are great. I take it you've heard the three-chord crunch of \\"Whole Lotta Love?\\" Ooh, now there's a riff! Some people have said it's the first metal song ever. I don't know about that, but I will grant that it was one of the first songs ever to feature an explicit sex section. Generally, explicit sex sections annoy me, but this one is really, really inventive. I don't know how they made those noises, but they sound very cool and appropriately freaky. I especially love the dive-bomb sounds. Or \\"Heartbreaker!\\" You know \\"Heartbreaker,\\" right? Again, the riff is stellar, head-banging goodness, and the guitar solo gives you some hammer-ons and pull-offs a good nine years before Eddie Van Halen made them popular! Cool points! Granted, I still don't think Page is as good of a guitarist as, say, Jimi Hendrix. But he could pull some sweet stuff out of his hat when he wanted to! I do find it annoying that he ripped off all the old blues musicians, though. Willie Dixon was a genius! Why he had to live out his life in relative obscurity compared to Zeppelin, who stole a lot of his material, is beyond me. Hell, they steal three Dixon tunes here: \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is \\"You Need Love,\\" \\"The Lemon Song\\" is \\"Killing Floor,\\" and \\"Bring it on Home\\" is, well... \\"Bring it on Home.\\"<br />Still, good album here. The last of the good rockers is the concise, funny \\"Living Loving Maid\\" (\\"When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills!\\" is a great lyric, and I generally think Zeppelin's lyrics are ridiculous and stupid or else overly obvious). The trippy guitar effects during the choruses are nice, too.<br />So Jimmy Page can really play electric guitar. I think we all knew that. But I've always preferred him as an acoustic guitarist, since there are times when I think he uses his distortion, effects pedals, and guitar-army stuff as a crutch. That happens to a lot of guitarists, Hendrix remaining an exception. And Page is certainly guilty of it, especially on Physical Graffiti and Presence, though it doesn't really happen here. Anyway, he plays a quality acoustic guitar solo on \\"Thank You,\\" and it really makes the song for me. Pretty decent mellow love song otherwise (although I think Robert \\"Squeeze my lemon\\" Plant's really struggling to keep a straight face as he sings), but the solo boosts the song up by itself. By the way, random fun fact about \\"Living Loving Maid.\\" Both that and Hendrix's pothead anthem \\"If Six Was Nine\\" (MUCH better song, by the way) contain verses about suns refusing to shine and mountains falling (or crumbling) into the sea. I'm pretty sure this is a coincidence. But look at the contrast between the songs' lyrics otherwise. This amuses me. Getting back to acoustic guitars, though, they're really hard to play well, speaking as somebody who's played both acoustic and electric. So no matter what reservations I have about this group's mythical status, I have to give Page my props for being able to play a great acoustic.<br />So anyway, it's too bad that the last two songs totally suck. \\"Moby Dick\\" is a world famous drum solo, but I find it really, really boring. I love hearing drum solos in jazz, especially when the band plays the melody line and the drummer responds to it with a little soloette. But there's something about classic rock bands not being called the Beatles or the Jimi Hendrix Experience (there's one on \\"If Six Was Nine,\\" and it rules) and really bad drum solos. Now, the riff they use to introduce \\"Moby Dick\\" is awesome. But all I hear in the drum solo is Bonzo going \\"thud whack pow splat thud whack pow splat.\\" There's also a part where he goes \\"whappity whappity whappity whappity whappity whappity whappity whappity,\\" just for a bit of variety. I'm sure this was quite something to see live (did you know he used to play those drums with his hands until he bled?), but that doesn't make the solo any less \\"thud whack pow splat thud whack pow splat.\\" And the first part of \\"Bring it on Home,\\" where Plant sings in that slurred \\"bluesman\\" voice, is offensive and borderline racist. Given the group's passion for the blues, I'm pretty sure Plant wasn't trying to be offensive with his vocals, and that the whole thing was just an honest mistake. But it was still a very bad idea. When the song actually begins in earnest, it doesn't get much better. I don't know what Page used to get his guitar to sound as bad as it sounds there. I probably don't want to, either. So stop the album before \\"Moby Dick,\\" and it's a masterpiece. Similarly, stop III before \\"Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp\\" (or burn yourself a copy with \\"Bron-Yr-Aur,\\" the lovely instrumental from Physical Graffiti; \\"Poor Tom,\\" and \\"Hey Hey What Can I Do\\" in the place of the last two songs), and it's a masterpiece. I hate it when that happens! Oh well. C'est la vie. Rock on!o play a great acoustic.

B00006879E|3.0|Maroon 5 seems to have absorbed many influences and have done a nice job of incorporating these influences into this CD. \\"Sunday Morning\\" has a nice Stevie Wonder vibe to it, \\"The Sun\\" sounds like an outtake from Sting's jazzier work, and \\"Shiver\\" almost sounds like a new one from Ricky Martin.(Man, I'm sure I'll hear it about this one.)\\"She Will be Loved\\" lifts the CD to a higher plane with it saoring vocals and passionate lyrics but the overall feel is one of pleasant familiarity. While the thematic element of all the songs being about the same subject is a bit of a stretch, I found this quite listenable and fun, but not exactly a life changing experience.
B0007P3582|1.0|50, I have some incredible advise for you: Shut the hell up. Seriously, this is getting old. By now we understand you're a gangsta pimp with big-bootied ladies and I'm getting tired of turning around and see him shooting at the Beatles' records. Rap is a disgrace, I wouldn't touch it. It used to mean something, I'll admit Run-DMC is okay. But now, it's just pointless.
B00079HZUM|3.0|i was very upset after watching this film.  with an all star cast i thought this movie was going to be great.  however, the acting was not quite as great as it could have been and the story line was much weaker than i expected.  i would recommend watching this film if you like one of the actors and want to see it, just to see it.  other than that this film is hardly worth the rental.
B000002UAR|5.0|When I was eleven, I picked this up along with Magical Mystery Tour at my local Barnes and Noble. Originally, I loved Magical Mystery Tour and thought Revolver was...okay. Three years later, I finally learned to appreciate Revolver and now can officially be called a fourteen-year-old Beatles fanatic. As I write this review, I listen to Eleanor Rigby and I finally have learned to appreciate it.<br />Taxman, Here There and Everywhere, For No One, I Want to Tell You and Tomorrow Never Knows are my favorites. I especially like Tomorrow Never Knows, a musical acid trip with, of course, John reading from the Tibetian Book of Death. Here There and Everywhere is my favorite number, a moment of beautiful harmonies and mature songwriting. For No One is another mature song with a French horn thrown in (Nice touch!) I Want to Tell You is an example of a classic case of what I call, \\"Verbal constipation\\". (If you don't know what it means, don't ask). Taxman is sly social commentary. She Said She Said is another winner, even if the lyrics are a downer. I'm Only Sleeping is semi-Hindu and incredibly psychadelic. Love You Too is a full-blown sitar attack by George Harrison...yeah. Every song here is something completely different from the previous. This album, along with Sgt. Pepper's, represented the height of the Beatles' experimentation phase. Rubber Soul was still very rock-based, and Magical Mystery Tour and the White Album had their fair share of filler. Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's, meanwhile, had one filler song between them (She's Leaving Home).<br />Revolver is reccomended for all Beatle fan and is tied with Sgt. Pepper's for their second-best. (Abbey Road is the best album ever made, period.)
B0007CNXUK|5.0|this is one of the best films of 2004.  johnny depp and kate winslet are great together.  being a huge fan of the story of peter pan, i loved every minute of this story.  it's truly a treasure.  because of it's low recognition by the oscars, this film has been quite overlooked and tossed aside.  i highly recommend seeing this film if you have not.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I don't see what the big deal about Slipknot is, all they do is wear dumb costumes and write songs about how much they hate the world or love the devil or whatever. They should attend a therapy session with Eminem and Korn.
B000068OSK|5.0|<br /> <br />This album is not the most immediate one you can buy - it takes a few listens before each track stands alone - but once I absorbed each song, I loved every one of them. <br /> <br />The music is loud and raw; the riffs are quick and catchy, and Jack's voice is compelling. The original songs are a mixture of quieter tunes, for example Sugar Never Tasted So Good and Do (2 of my particular favourites) and more Zeppelinesque numbers like The Big 3 Killed My Baby or Cannon. The lyrics are often simple but heartfelt (\\"When I hear my name/I wanna disappear!/when I see my face/ I wanna disappear!\\" serves as one example...however few of them are quite this anguished), and the occasional use of the piano is a nice touch (St James Infirmary Blues). <br /> <br />The Robert Johnson \\"Stop Breakin' Down\\" cover is inspired - it is full of imagination and emotion that really brings it life . The Dylan cover is another effective song, largely thanks to Dylan's lyrics, but Jack White conveys melancholy beautifully. <br /> <br />This album is very different from the more recent White Stripes albums Elephant and Get Behind Me Satan, and has more in common with De Stijl/White Blood Cells.  <br />This album is well worth buying for two reasons: <br />1. It has 17 tracks <br />2. All of them are brilliant <br />:)
B0009KA7BS|3.0|First let me say, I read the comic, and the comic is excellent. It's very dark, edgy, and well written. This movie is loosly based on the comic. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I went from utter joy to utter despair once I saw who was cast as John Constantine. Yes, Keanu is bad, but he is always bad. I accept that as a reality that will not change. But, this movie is very watchable on its own. Yes, it has a few moments of Hollywood cheese, like the the cross shotgun (makes me shudder and ask WHY? WHY? ); but overall it's pretty good. Over years of hyper-critical movie analysis, I've learned to accept that Hollywood will never change, and they will twist and distort anything of true artistic merit in order to make it more profitable (or so they think). When it comes to big budget movies, take my advice, expect nothing and you'll be more likely to find something you enjoy about it. If you want to see an adaptation done to an almost flawless degree, watch Sin City.
B00064AM6C|5.0|This DVD captures the wonderful, unique nature of the White Stripes so well. Unpolished and raw, you get the impression that their years of mainstream success has not tainted their original passion in the slightest; it is easy to imagine them playing exactly the same in some tiny Detroit venue. The grainy film gives the performance extra ambiance (and complements the black/red/white colour scheme perfectly!). <br /> <br />The setlist includes many classic cover versions (my favorite is Jolene - its even more powerful than the studio version) and great reworkings of their own songs. I've seen the band live myself, and this is compares favourably to that. Bascially, if you want a flavour of this band playing live, or want to relive your own experience of them, I recommend this DVD :)
0765309408|5.0|This book is written in the flavor of Heinlein but with lots of sassy characters.  Pretty much every comment by every character is a flippant remark.  The theme is that humans who \\"come of age\\" (are about to die of old age) are recruited into the army to fight aliens in deep space. <br /> <br />A major point of question in the start of the book is exactly how these old people will contribute to the deep space army.  Without giving anything away, I'll mention that they are able to with the benefit of the right technology.  <br /> <br />This story follows the adventures of John Perry, a 75 year old guy who joins the space marines and then delves into a lot of battles, nicely orchestrated with underlying themes and tension, and with lots of tactical and strategic analysis going on.  If you like scifi space combat, this is definitely a book to read.  If anything, the operatic movement of the strategy could have been drawn out a little longer- this was a difficult book to put down and I was saddened at having it come to an end. <br /> <br />(I am a pacifist, but not when it comes to blowing apart aliens- I have no problem with fighting other species for territory) <br /> <br />However, the older people come across as acting like young twentysomethings- perhaps they will in sixty years- but I suspect that the endless squabbling for primate hierarchy through verbal comebacks is more a function of the youth rather than the elderly.  The witty remarks though are brilliant for a book (many witty remarks that are funny that you hear come across flat when you read them)- you will laugh out loud at this book in a number of places. <br /> <br />So I will recommend this highly for anyone who enjoys scifi battle romps.  Some great ideas and exploration of how science will impact the future of humanity with a protagonist struggling through this future- what scifi is supposed to be about.

B00003CXB2|5.0|This is the greatest movie I have ever seen.  Not only is it superb filmmaking, but the film touches on a personal level I never expected to feel.  David Lean's WW1 epic follows the both heroic and tragic military campaign of T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole in an Oscar-nominated role).  When we first see Lawrence interact with others, he comes off as a bumbling fool, but his encyclopedic knowledge of the world earns him his first significant mission --- find Arab Prince Feisal, and learn of the Arabs' intentions.  Whatever he learns will help the British campaign function more effectively for their own purposes.  However, after meeting Feisal and his Sherif Ali, Lawrence instead becomes the central figure in the campaign by uniting the Arabs against the Turkish Empire, rather than report back to his British superiors.    Make no mistake - \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is NOT a war film.  There is glory of combat here; the battle sequences are brief and not very well-choreographed.  But that's because Lean doesn't want us to see Lawrence's aim-and-shoot techniques.  No, instead Lean smartly stays on his facial expressions -- O'Toole's behavior tells the story better than a battle's body count.  When an enemy fort is overtaken, the \\"battle\\" is simply a camera pan of horses charging in.  We don't need to witness an elaborate sequence because we only need to know that the Arabs defeated the Turks.  \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is almost 4 hours, but is stripped to its essentials like those who dwell in its deserts.    The film features a wonderful cast of supporting characters.  Alec Guinness reteams with David Lean to play Prince Feisal, a leader of patient wisdom and admiration for Lawrence's passion.  Omar Sharif made a star-making American debut (and Oscar-nominated performance) as Sherif Ali, whose strong loyalty to Lawrence also brings him immense pain when his friend is also suffering.  Lawrence and Ali are as equal as they are opposite; Sharif's chemistry with O'Toole is perfect.The most obvious acheivement of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is the cinematography and Lean's direction.  Orson Welles \\"Citizen Kane\\" is a brilliant piece of filmmaking, but Lean overshadows that classic with more color and vivid imagery.  There are too many genius shots to praise.  The mirage sequence is the most famous, in which Ali's figure begins as a speck, but then rides ever so closer on a camel with no music...but haunting silence!  Or when Lawrence is just assigned his mission: he looks at a burning match, exhales so gently...and the camera quick-cuts to a beautiful sunset in the Arabian desert.  We witness the harsh realities of desert warfare, but don't actually see much blood or corpses.  Instead, stirring dialogue and tracking shots get a strong enough reaction that the guns and casualties don't really matter.    The dialogue is sharp enough to rival \\"Casablanca\\" or \\"Pulp Fiction\\".  Screenwriter Robert Bolt's dialogue is so truthful, poetic, and eloquent -- it's a thrill just to hear these characters 'speak'.  The scenes involving strategy and tactics aren't glorious declarations of brilliance; instead, they're more like verbal chess matches between stubborn parties.  For example: an Arab Bureau liaison, Dryden (Claude Rains at his smarmiest), is devilishly manipulative.  However, Rains' tonation is neutral yet wicked.  When a reporter asks Dryden what happened during a secret meeting, he casually replies \\"Oh...nothing...nothing at all.\\"  His lies are so obvious, telling us he intentionally rubs the secrecy in his adversaries' faces.    Another remarkable acheivement is Maurice Jarre's music score.  Simply put, it's amazing and legendary!  Thankfully, the DVD keeps the 4 and 1/2 minute Overture, Intermission, and Exit Music.  For those unfamiliar, when cinematic epics played in movie theatres, music was played before the movie began.  It helped audiences settle in and get ready for the film to begin.  There were no images on the screen, but the music just played.  The filmmakers took great pride in the best presentation possible for a film that took about 2 years to make.  \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is as much as pleasure to listen to as it to watch it.    Another point on the main character - credit for the portrayal of T.E. Lawrence belongs equally to the entire production team.  Bolt knew how to write him, Lean knew how to shoot him, Jarre knew what music to write for him, Anne Coates knew how to properly edit and pace his character, and O'Toole knew how the play him.  This strong collaberation of artists results in a rarity: we, the audience, can relate to a historical figure who a total 'enigma'.  As presented in the film, T.E. Lawrence was a man of dual-willed dilemmas.  He keeps unfathomable promises, but lacks the heart to be satisfied.  He's a central war figure who inspires many, but eventually rejects his talents.  As I said earlier, the character is collaborative effore - I forgot to mention the supporting characters who give their take on this bizarre man.  They, I believe, is the heart of the film.  One of the opening scenes reveals differing opinions on Lawrence's legacy.  A reporter calls him a \\"shameless exhibitionist\\", while a British soldier calls him \\"a very great man\\".  But is there any truth is what any of these men say?  And if so, do they have enough credibility to even have an opinion?  T.E. Lawrence (according the film) never really knew who he was or what he really wanted.  Because of that confusing shell, his outcast reputation strengthed his ego to accomplish daring feats like crossing an endless desert, but also deeply hurt those closest to him (and those who only wanted his talents).    \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is a one-of-a-kind experience.  It has powerful music, unforgettable camera shots, beautiful dialogue, jaw-dropping images, spectacular sequences, stellar acting, and historical significance!  There will never be a greater cinema epic than \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\"...    DVD NOTES  There are two versions of this movie on DVD.  1) A One-Disc version that has no Special Features.  That is worth a purchase alone, because you can watch the film in one sitting.    2) This Limited Edition DVD splits the movie into two halves.  The video and audio quality appear to be the same, but the 2-Disc release has full-motion menus with music, whereas the other version only has freeze-frame menus.  The second Disc includes an outstanding making-of documentary, some comments from Steven Spielberg on the restoration, and a few neat promotional materials.  Seeing thses artists work themselves tirelessly for 2 years will only further your appreciation for this movie.  Even if you don't share my praise for the film, you will admire the patience and hard work that everybody invested into it.  This was not one man's vision; \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is collage of brilliant filmmakers and artists composing an unforgettable tale!    I've often heard people say one film is their 'favorite', but then they say another is the 'greatest'.  To me, my all-time favorite and standard of greatness are the same film.  Watch this film immediately!

B000001FFJ|5.0|Rain dogs, rain dogs. Rain dogs are these songs... songs that time will carry on and mould and disfigure and shape and mend and break and heal and reinvent and immortalise. Songs that belong to no period of time. Songs that belong only to eternity. Songs that belong to us all. A gentleman performer and songcrafter, Mr. Tom Waits, recieved these vignettes from somewhere only he and his sweetheart, the darling Mrs. Kathleen, knew of. A secret place that smelled of whiskey and Brut cologne and where old men wore top hats and gesticulated with walking sticks the horses.  <br />       And Rain Dogs came to our knowledge. It was always alive, somewhere, hidden away until Mr. Waits found it and transmitted it to us, the living. These songs were sang by the dead. Now we can enter this universe that Waits puts to english and we too can sail tonight for singapore, see old men in tailor-made suits fall from windows with confetti in their hair from an American-Italian 3rd class housing district in Manhattan in June 1931, we can play the accordian for Mr. Rice, we can walk Spanish down the hall and, of course, we can dance with the Rose of Tralee. How many of you know what the Rose of Tralee is, and who is that Rose?  <br />        So sacrifice your heartstrings and let them be plucked relentlessly by tales of downtown trains, time and Morea. Cinncinati. Some men will do it for diamonds, some men will do it for gold. It's all there. The deeper you search, the more you'll understand.... <br /> <br />              .... for you... are a rain dog too....

0451135393|4.0|\\"The Long Walk\\" is one of the Richard Bachman novels that has a clear distinction from the rest of Stephen King's body of work. Like \\"The Running Man,\\" it is essentially a dystopian novel, which is extremely rare in King's fiction because his greatest strength as a horror writer has always been that he could take the fantastic and put it in the world of the commonplace. King's horrors are always around the corner or in the near future (each edition of \\"The Stand\\" is revised towards just that end) and they usually happen to relatively normal persons. But even though \\"The Long Walk\\" takes place in some sort of fascist America, this not a warning in the tradition of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" or \\"The Handmaid's Tale.\\" It is simple the world that King needed to construct in order to tell his story.<br /><br />The Long Walk takes place each year and only 100 applicants, selected from around the country, are allowed to participate. The prize, which speaks to the nature of the world in which it takes place, is everything you want for the rest of your life. Evita did something similar to this to distract the people of Argentina from the fact the thievery of the Perons, but there is a key difference in that she just granted wishes at her whim while the Long Walk consists of a competition. The basic rule is simple: whoever walks the farthest wins. The conditions of the competition are what makes this a horror story: the participants must walk four miles an hour and not stop. Failing to do so results in a warning. Three warnings and you are shot.<br /><br />The story works because who has not had to keep on walking when they wanted to stop, sit down, and rest? The difference is that nobody is going to put a bullet in our head when we do so. But for Ray Garrity and the other Long Walkers that is going to happen to every single one of them save the winner. The reasons why these young men would spend their lives on such a desperate gamble are second to the Long Walk itself. In the end the story turns out to be vintage King, where he displays the horrors of the journey and milks it for everything it is worth.<br /><br />I will end with my strongest recommendation that you read \\"The Long Walk\\" in a single sitting. Ray and the others do not have a respite during their walk and I really think you lose something essential to the experience otherwise and the book is closer to a novella than an epic novel.the story turns out to be vintage King, where he displays the horrors of the journey and milks it for everything it is worth. <br /> <br />I will end with my strongest recommendation that you read \\"The Long Walk\\" in a single sitting.

B00005JNSK|4.0|I never really saw the entire version of \\"willie wonka and the chocolate factory\\" but what i did see was enough to get me interested in seeing this, along with Tim Burton being one of the most creative directors who could put his own unique twist on a movie. I really like this movie. It takes a little too long to get to the actual core of the movie, but once it gets there it goes pretty fast and is extremly enjoyable. Johnny Depp is great, altho i think his acting is not that great. He plays willie wonka, an astranged candy make/inventor, greatly, bringing his own weird aspects to the character. The other actors are all equally as good. The visuals are also amazing, and stunningly beautiful. Tim Burton did a great job with this movie and he re-invented it and tried not to make a tired remake and he succeeded. Great movie and the box office sales prove it.
0679428895|1.0|I read \\"Fatherland\\" and liked it.  Terrific premise--that Hitler had not lost WWII--and reasonably well-made characters. <br /> <br />Then I read \\"Enigma\\" and hated it.  I kept expecting it to get better.  It never did.  Unlike \\"Fatherland,\\" \\"Enigma\\" merely stuck to facts--the breaking of the German code in WWII.  The characters were lifeless and the plot a snore. <br /> <br />\\"Pompeii\\" is more like \\"Enigma\\"--no messing with actual history; just a fictional rendition of it. <br /> <br />And it is equally dull.  I teach Latin, so I know the history and the details.  The fictional characters are one-dimensional at best; more like zero-dimensional.  They are predictable and uninteresting.  And the plot, of course, is known beforehand.  The romance has no sparks. <br /> <br />If you want to learn some history, this book will teach you.  But as a novel it is dry, dry, dry.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I was highly anticipating this album and it has not disappointed one bit.  I became a fan of Coldplay about 1.5 years ago and I've been constantly listening to them ever since.  My first purchase was their second album,'A Rush of Blood to the Head',which I consider to be a classic.  It was love at first listen.  So then I purchased the newly released (at the time) 'Live 2003' album, which took my liking of Coldplay to the next level.  They are amazing live and I cannot wait to see them in concert this September.  Then I decided to pick up 'Parachutes' which was their first cd and put them on the map in the U.S.  With songs under their belt such as 'Yellow' and 'Trouble' from 'Parachutes', 'Clocks' and 'In My Place' from 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' and their AMAZING live album, I was eagerly awaiting the release of 'X&Y'.  I was curious to see if they could do better than 'A Rush of Blood to the Head'.  I felt their first cd was good and the second was better and now after listening to 'X&Y' numerous times, I can honestly say this is their best.  From start to finish, you can listen to this GREAT cd without skipping a single track.  Their may not be a 'Clocks', which won a Grammy last year for Record of the Year, but collectively 'X&Y' actually outdoes their previous efforts.  That's what makes them so great.  Each release gets better.  It's an enormous accomplishment to be able do that.  They are rocks (or 'soft' rock as many will say) version of Outkast.  Their popularity and material gets stronger and stronger.  If your a fan or someone looking for a great cd, pick this up.  You won't be disappointed!<br /><br />Standout Tracks on album - 'Square One', 'Fix You', 'Speed of Sound', 'Talk', 'A Message' and 'X&Y'.  I really tried to name just a couple, but it's too many good songs.  Just go cop it!!!

B00000IQW5|4.0|Spielberg deserves a fresh look. I open with that because as I read the decidedly mixed thoughts on this and other films of his, I notice the same thought over and over again. People who review Spielberg usually want to pigeonhole him into a type: the ET-warm-and-fuzzy-alien children's storyteller versus the special-effects-heavy-but-rather-empty-plot dreamer. All the while there is the generic whine of 'why doesn't he ever try to do something else (SCHINDLER'S LIST notwithstanding)?' Then when he does, as evidenced here, there are wails of dissatisfaction that he tried to do something over his head. Oy. <br /> <br />It's so silly to label and categorize a filmmaker so much. ALWAYS is, first and foremost, a love story. A remake of an earlier film to be sure, but even this 1989 treatment looks and feels nostalgic with its amber-tinted cinematography, the sentimental presentation of the devoted fighter pilots, and the appearance of the ageless, magical Audrey Hepburn (sharp as a tack in her last film as a bright-eyed, no-nonsense angel). All of Hepburn's scenes with Richard Dreyfuss are wonderful (especially the first one when she tries- slightly befuddled- to explain his state of existence), as is the leitmotiv of \\"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes-\\" used in two dance sequences with Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter: one at a charming birthday party, and the other in a bewitching mourning sequence. And once again, John Goodman rises to the occasion as the best friend anyone could ever have. Just saw it on TCM, rounding out a July 2005 tribute to Ms. Hepburn. You should check it out.
B0009A40ES|4.0|This movie is so damn cool, the acting by Bale is great top notch, he plays some up tight yuppie from wall street who is infatuated with his own self while going around killing people. <br /> <br />The 80's music is cool and just funny as hell for some reason , like when he shows the cover of phil collins album. This movie is full of laughs and great acting and directing, there are 3 or 4 murders like 1 or 2 in the beginig and then like 2 at the  very end, it would have been nice to throw one in the middle. <br /> <br />More violence would have got this 4 stars but since there wasnt it I will go with 3 1/2 stars. A cool movie glad I own and , yes I will watch plenty of time the acting and 80's music and the way the type of person Bale plays he does awesome, this is a movit  own but i do advise rent first cause I think its a movie that is wierd in its own way and not going to attract every one. <br /> <br />Me personally Im glad I own it and Im pissdd i didnt pick up the american psycho figure when it came out in july, I bought jason Voorhees if i would have known amore about American Psycho I would have brought the figure hopefully i find it some where else then I could get it.

B000001DU5|4.0|I was looking about to see what others had said about this album and was surprised and a little perplexed to see that someone had called Tears for Fears \\"kitschy.\\"  Tears for Fears was very middle-of-the-road pop and commercial, but \\"kitschy\\" seems to me to be a very inappropriate term for their music; formulaic, probably; commercial, definitely; bombastic, frequently, but \\"kitschy\\" is something that should be left for pink flamingos and cars on blocks.  Tears for Fears created some interesting and clever music, and regardless of how bombastic the music may occasionally be, it remains enjoyable.<br /><br />Several of these songs were top 10 U.S. hits in the 1980s.  \\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\" reached #2, \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" reached #1, \\"Shout\\" reached #1, and \\"Head Over Heels\\" reached #3.  After that are the top 40 U.S. hits, \\"Woman in Chains\\" reached #36, and \\"Mother's Talk\\" reached #27.<br /><br />I have a preference for the more pop-like music on this CD.  The number one, two and three hits are my favorite.  However, all the songs on this CD offer a lot of appeal.  \\"Woman in Chains\\" was Tears for Fears attempt to expose once again the plight of women mistreated by their husbands and men in general.  I liken this song to \\"Only Women Bleed\\" by Alice Cooper.  This song is somber and emotional with Phil Collins on drums and a guest appearance by Oleta Adams on vocals.  There is the surreal and slightly funky song \\"Mad World\\" that addresses the confusion we all feel sometimes at various times in our lives, though this song is focused on the confusion of being a teenager.<br /><br />Though the song \\"Pale Shelter\\" deals with a completely different subject, each time I hear the opening I am reminded of the African Anteater Ritual in \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\"  See the movie and then listen to this song and see if you agree.  This song is a perfect example of 80s New Wave rock.  \\"I Believe\\" is a song whose intent is to lament the difference between the world as it is and as we wish it could be.  This wonderfully mellow and slow song is an extreme contrast to the typical music on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Laid so Low (Tears Roll Down)\\" is a marvelous little song that has some similarity to Tears for Fears' top 10 hits, but is unknown unless you have the albums on which the song was included or live in the countries where this song got air play, which excludes the U.S.  \\"Change\\" is another interesting song that went to #4 in the U.K., with a fast pace and a style that occasionally reminds me of Devo.  The CD finishes with another mellow song that transcends genres.  \\"Advice for the Young at Heart\\" is a mellow love song that is a perfect capstone for this collection.<br /><br />Tears for Fears is a rock group with a solid musical catalog that seems to appeal to middle of the road pop and rock fans, yet the music is interesting and avoids clich&eacute;.  My only chagrin is that the group did not release more albums.

Hence external charger and an additional battery.<br /><br />New and fully charged, one battery's charge lasted 3 days with frequent use.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I don't understand why so many reviews on this site rate this album sub-par. Face it, Dream Theater is never going to make another Metropolis album. Octavarium is a great outing nevertheless. The incessant head-pounding assault that was Train of Thought delivered us sensory overkill with relentless metallic riffs, rough vocals, and at least seemingly 2 minutes of Petrucci shredding in each song. Here, Dream Theater gives a more well-rounded performance, with elements from all of their previous albums. James LaBrie is at his best during some moments of Octavarium, and Jordan Rudess gets a lot of time to shine. While The Root of All Evil and Panic Attack display the harder, Metallica influenced sounds of Six Degrees and Train of Thought, songs like The Answer Lies Within and I Walk Beside You remind me of some of the lighter ballads from Images and Words and Falling Into Infinity. These Walls is unlike anything they've done before, with an almost alternative rock feeling to it. The highlights of this album are the last two tracks, as these display Dream Theater's wide range of musical abilities and incredible composing of epics that most other bands can't do. This is where they shine, and the title track may be the best Dream Theater song since Change of Seasons. While it may not have the amazing technical prowess of Metropolis pt. 2, Octavarium blends really well, and unlike some Dream Theater albums, the band plays better together than when they are \\"showing off\\" apart from each other, and that's when this albums works amazingly.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Simply put...this version of PETER PAN is the movie that Steven Spielberg should have made instead of the misguided effort with Robin Williams a decade earlier. Here is the live action version of the classic Disney animated feature that we have long waited for. With some incredible acting, beautiful cinematography and fantastic sets this is a splash of fantasy that truly entertains and is a wonder to behold.<br /><br />Yes, the movie does hold truer to the 1953 Disney production than the Barrie book, but it works so well here that one does not mind.<br /><br />The two young leads in Jeremy Sumpter (as Peter) and Rachel Hurd-Wood (as Wendy) are remarkable finds. Sumpter portrays Peter's childlike wonder and sense of fun convincingly, while Wood really goes through possibly the biggest of character arcs, ready to grow up as the movie draws to a close.<br /><br />Everybody is already well familiar with the story. Wendy and her two brothers are whisked away to NeverLand (not to be confused with the Jackson ranch) on a great adventure where they meet up with the Lost Boys (orphans, not the vampires of the well known popular movie), pirates, evil mermaids, crocodiles and the villainous Capt. Hook.<br /><br />Whereas NeverLand is a place where nobody grows up the movie itself is all about growing up. Every character goes through some story arc from Peter and Wendy, all the way to Mr. Darling (who realizes how much he really misses his children and throws financial considerations and social standing out the window) to Aunt Millicent (played wonderfully zany by Lynn Redgrave) who really embraces the idea of motherhood by the end of the movie.<br /><br />With top billing Jason Isaacs portrays the double role of Mr. Darling and Capt. Hook and he really puts his all into every scene with a reserved conservative air to Darling to an exuberant over-the-top appropriate overacting for the flamboyant Hook.<br /><br />My favorite scenes are probably those between Sumpter and Wood. With a slightly gawky cuteness to her, its easy to see why Peter becomes so taken by Wood's Wendy and their relationship develops in some of the best scripted child character scenes I have yet witnessed.<br /><br />Of course, as is the case with so many big-budget movies these days, one of the big stars of the movie is the computer special effects. One scene I found particularly impressive was the shot of the pirate ship traversing the landmarks of London at the end with the fog taking on the appearance and characteristics of the ocean, but really the whole movie is a wonder to behold.<br /><br />Fans of British television will recognize well-known character actors such as Geoffrey Palmer as Darlings boss (Sir Edward Quiller Couch) and Richard Briers (as Smee). Also those with sharp ears will recognize the narrators voice as that of international star Saffron Burrows.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed this movie and how rewarding and satisfying it was, but really the proof is there for the individual viewer. This is a movie that is safe and enjoyable for the whole family and as such is, in my opinion, one of the best live-action family films to come out of Hollywood since the golden age of Walt Disney in the 1950s and 1960s.s to her, its easy to see why Peter becomes so taken by Wood's Wendy and their relationship develops in some of the best scripted child character scenes I have yet witnessed.  <br />Of course, as is the case with so many big-budget movies these days, one of the big stars of the movie is the computer special effects.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|OK, I admit it. I missed this gem when it aired. Fox had the stupidity to bury it on a Friday night when I'm never home. I saw the trailer for the movie and became intrigued, and rented the DVD's. Of course, I LOVE this show. It's Joss Whedon, who can do no wrong in my book. <br /> <br />You have 9 totally different people with totally different veiwpoints, who have created this odd little \\"family\\" in the outer rim of space. Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), who fancies himself this cynical, faithless, indifferent smuggler, is, in actuality, noble and generous to those he cares about, and ruthless to those who go up against him or his crew. His right hand, Zoe (Gina Torres), could have been this hard nosed, killing-machine type, but for the love of a good man, her husband (and ship's pilot, and resident wise ass) Wash (Alan Tudyk), who is totally not intimidated by his amazon warrior wife. Then you have the hired mercenary, Jayne (Adam Baldwin) and you are never sure of his loyalties. A more self centered, anything-for-a-buck type you may never meet, but his continued interactions with everyone aboard \\"Serenity\\" starts exposing a more thoughtful, human side. If the show had continued, you might have been able to say you actually liked Jayne. Ship's mechanic, Kaylee (Jewel Straite), is like everyone's kid sister. Quick to smile and tease, you wonder where a girl like that got such a mechanical mind.  Legalized Companion Inara (Morena Baccarin), has rented Serenity's shuttle for her... um... business liasons, and she and Malcolm have a very complicated relationship. In the first episode, the ship picks up three passengers that become part of the crew: Shepherd Book (Ron Glass), a futuristic version of a priest, who has knowledge and connections that no one sheltered in a monastary should have, and Simon Tam (Sean Maher), a brilliant young doctor turned fugitive after rescuing his kid sister River (Summer Glau), from being a human guinea pig for the Alliance.River at first seems like a complete loon and disconnected, but you slowly realize that she has been engineered into becoming maybe a super assasin, maybe a messiah, you just don't know. All you know is that the Alliance is willing to kill (and in a quite painful and unpleasant manner) to get her back. Hopefully the film will answer these questions. <br /> <br />You had a mix of action, moments both hilarious and heartbreaking, and some characters that were sympathetic and others downright scary. And how in the world do spaceships, horses and rifles, and a little bit of Mandarin Chinese fit together to create a perfect new vision of the future? Once again, it's the brilliance of Joss Whedon. There's so much more I wish I knew about these characters. Thank goodness for the movie. Keeping my fingers crossed that film is a success, so that the saga of \\"Firefly\\" continues.
0767830555|2.0|Didn't see this movie back in the 70's, and never intended to until I recognized that a lot of Amazon reviewers compared \\"One Hour Photo\\" (a film I thought was excellent) with \\"Taxi Driver\\". So I relented and eagerly viewed the DVD, only to berate myself for having been duped.<br /><br />Briefly - \\"Taxi Driver\\" is the story of Travis Bickle, an ex-Marine turned NYC cab driver; a young man who \\"means well\\" but is a macho character with s*** for brains (kind of like the creators of this movie, I'm sorry to say). Anyone who hasn't sense enough not to take a woman to a smutty movie loses my interest and sympathy pretty quickly. Bickle is his own worst enemy; he doesn't have the patience or wherewithal to apply himself to get educated, etc. to make life better for himself and others. He just wants life to improve, NOW! OK, sure. So he instigates some bloodshed and death, and somehow sometime winds up a sort-of hero. HUH?<br /><br />I tried to get some insight on the HUH? part by viewing the \\"documentary\\" section of the DVD, but I just couldn't muddle all the way through it. It was full of nothing but ego-driven minutiae; details about stuff no sane person would care about (yawn), so I gave up and will happily dispatch the DVD back to the Public Library today and wash my hands of it. The End.<br /><br />PS What WAS interesting however, is the fact that this movie was made back when parts of NYC were so blighted that one could buy a Park Avenue co-op for the price (in today's $$$) of a used car. One of my relations did just that.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Dream Theater's hard and heavy album, with metal riffs galore.  I enjoyed Train of Thought's assault the first couple of songs through, but it eventually bored me. The heavy metal sound works well in some parts, especially on This Dying Soul and Endless Sacrifice (the best songs on the album), but the almost nu-metal feeling of songs like As I Am and Honor Thy Father drag them down. John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy blast through these long, pounding sounds with a ferocity like no other DT album out there, and they play so fast and furiously that at times it's hard to keep your head from spinning. One can't help feel like this is the angriest of their albums, and it works really well through about half of it. If you loved the DT of Images and Words and Metropolis Pt. 2, this will be a shock. It's still better than most other prog-metal albums out there. Worth a listen to, if not just for the always impressive Petrucci and Portnoy.  More like 3.5/5
B00003CXCT|5.0|Enough has been written about how much some fans dislike the changes that Lucas made to his movies from the Greedo shooting first controversy in A NEW HOPE to the inserting of prequel star Hayden Christenson at the end of RETURN OF THE JEDI. So, I do not plan to address those to ad nauseum, suffice to say I think the movies were perfect the way they were originally released in 1977, 1980 and 1983 respectively.<br />I was one of the generation of young movie-goers who, after learning of this movie on the school playground, persuaded my mother shortly after my sixth birthday to drive 65 miles to see the movie at a small Scottish movie theater,<br />I am assuming that people are familiar with the storylines of these three movies that chronicle the journey of farmboy Luke Skywalker from a remote desert planet to interplanetary hero and rising Jedi master.<br />Regardless how you feel about the movies as they exist today, you cannot help but admit that this is an impressive set. After years of sitting on the fence over the format and drawing fire from the early adopters of DVD like myself, George Lucas has dived into putting out his movies on the digital format with a great deal of enthusiasm. The year before had seen the Indiana Jones trilogy finally finding its way onto DVD to much acclaim and here Lucas uses much the same formula (3 discs for the movies plus a bonus disc of special features) in his release of the original STAR WARS pictures.  Comprised in this set is (the retitled) A NEW HOPE (1977), THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980) and RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983).<br />However, whereas the Indiana Jones set featured no film makers audio commentaries (Director Steven Spielberg apparently disapproves of the practice), here we have three very interesting audio commentaries. Appearing on all three tracks are George Lucas as producer (and director of A NEW HOPE), Sound Designer Ben Burtt, Special Effects wizard Dennis Muren and actress Carrie (Princess Leia) Fisher. Also joining the team for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the director of that movie Irvin Kirshner (the director of the third movie Richard Marquand sadly passed away years ago).<br />Burtt provides some of the most interesting facts or the tracks, who knew that sound effects could be so fascinating?! It's really interesting to learn some of the most amazing things and places that Burtt used to come up with the sounds of the franchise. If you've ever wondered what was used to come up with the sounds of laser fire or the burps and beeps that R2-D2 uses then you will find the answer among these commentaries.<br />But, in my opinion the best and most thoroughly entertaining commentary is provided for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Kershner is a very engaging and fascinating speaker and he relates a number of anecdotal information surrounding the goings-on around the set. He even mentions how he would get so taken by the Yoda puppet that he would catch himself giving direction to the puppet rather than Frank Oz and his team of puppeteers below the stage. Kirsh (as he affectionately known) also recounts the rigors the rigors of filming the Hoth scenes in Norway. He talks about the filming of the scene of Luke stumbling towards the camera (where he sees the image of Ben), with Kersh and crew warm and comfortable shooting from the entranceway of the hotel as actor Hamill was freezing outside.<br />Sadly Fisher is the least talkative of all the participants which leads the commentaries to be top-heavy in technical details.<br />As Indiana Jones had a three hour documentary on the making of those movies, so to does the STAR WARS trilogy. Named \\"Empire of Dreams\\" and shown in a heavily edited form on US television just prior to the DVD release, the documentary is incredibly detailed on all aspects of production.<br />Knowing how popular and successful we now know STAR WARS was, its interesting to see how skeptical some at the studio (and on the crew) were regarding the viability of the movie. It is noted that the presence of the highly respected Alec Guinness on the set helped the (largely British) crew take the movie more seriously.  What is gratifying is also the reaction to the rough cut of the movie to the Fox board, we learn that one of the executives cried at the screening and rushed home to tell his family about the amazing movie.<br />Perhaps most interesting visually is the screen tests for some of those who tried out for the roles including Kurt Russell trying out for the Han Solo role. Funnily in a modern-day (circa 2004) on-camera interview Mark Hamill is still able to recount his lines from his 1976 screen test.<br />Rounding out the set are a selection of smaller featurettes and trailers. Taken altogether this set is well worth the wait, There are various rumors circulating however that Lucas plans to redo the movies again, this time in 3-D but until the next editions this set will be a valued part of any DVD collection.the highly respected Alec Guinness on the set helped the (largely British) crew take the movie more seriously.

B0009UC7H0|5.0|Sahara is the perfect action movie because it has a great cast and it incorperates humor in to the scenes that are so action packed you are on the edge of your seats. This movie has some of the coolest action sequences I have ever seen. Buy this movie you wont be disapionted.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|It is rare to hear such superbly trained voices! This CD soothes the trained ear that longs to hear quality singers. The music is fun, enchanting, haunting, inspiring... it will surely delight your soul.  If your ears are weary of listening to dime-a-dozen vocals you will want to restore your faith in current talent by listening to this CD.
B00005JMUA|1.0|I seriously can't believe people are still so obsessed with these two movies.  All they are is a complete savagefest of unnecessary blood and fighting moves.  This movie is just as gory(in an unnecessary amount) as the recent release Land of the Dead, the only difference is there are swords (in 2003 and 2004) and there is some kind of strange exagerated martial arts...  Overall it's simple to say Quentin Tarantino himself is overrated as a director as well (I didn't say actor because I don't think anyone has ever confused him as a good one in that catagory), and his truly only good movie was Pulp Fiction.  This movie as well as the first one were disapointing especially after all the hype i heard about both of them.  There's $6.50 and 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is trashy, loud rock at its absolute best! Few albums are as raw, loud, or intense as 'Appetite'. After a decade of mostly s*&^, Guns n Roses not only rocked hard, but managed to get their ballsy rock to the mainstream. Though Axl would later become an egomaniac and replace the magnificent Slash for a bum who wears a KFC bucket on his head (and so originally calls himself Buckethead), on this, their first and possibly finest album, Axl's raw, passionate vocals are excellent and the band is amazing. Slash is truly one of the world's most talented musicians and should not be written off as just another rock guitarist; the man has serious talent. I also recommend 'Raw Power' by Iggy and the Stooges and 'Back in Black' by AC/DC if you enjoy this album and are looking for others that rock as hard.
B00005JNSK|5.0|\\"Charlie and The Chocolate Factory\\" certainly is a delightful film I can really sink my teeth into!! It has to be, {if not one of} the best and most beautiful movie I've ever seen. It is just dark enough to be as good as it is and everybody portrays their roles perfectly! The factory is amazing inside and has a Tim Burton feel to it. The movie itself, does not seem dark at first, and it has a twist to it, but not anything like Beetlejuice. It does things in it's own way and what I mean by that is that while it is not as unusual as other Tim Burton movies, you can tell he'd direct it the right way. Just like the upcoming movie \\"Corpse Bride\\" which also looks wonderful. This has some new stuff which was not in the original, and the oompa loompas are cooler. It makes the whole movie very strange, and I walked into the theater having complete faith in Tim Burton and Johnny Depp and while I scarfed down those Milk Duds when watching it, this movie did not disappoint, and ought to be a classic in time!
0805076476|5.0|I don't think the book would've been as funny if I didn't already see the movie and picture Ed Norton getting pulled into Meatloaf's bosom.  And the movie did a way better job of keeping the plot twist until the end (I don't think I would have been bright enough to read though it). Reading Fight Club definitely made me want to read Palahniuk's other books.  And that's all I really have to say, I only read it for entertainment value.  That's all - forget all the philosophy and artsy-fartsy bs pompus talk - read it if you liked the movie too - you don't have to be a trendster punk kid talking about Kant or something.
B00005JMXX|5.0|This movie is excellent. It's a movie \\"I\\" would like to be in. The creators did an excellent job in the special effects, the bad weather, the stage setting, and basically everything. There should be a second part to this movie.
B00003CX95|5.0|If you have read any of my other reviews you would know that realism is something that i hold in great esteem, this movie is practically nothing but.  The way Scotland is seen in the movie as well as the hero William Wallace is incredible in terms of how accurately it's displayed.  Mel Gibson, excellent actor and even better director.  Do yourself a huge favor and purchase this movie immediately.  I don't know if the sale will still be there when you're reading this review but as of July 28th 2005 it's over 50% off, and that's an excellent deal.  By the way, I'd like to finish by warning you NOT to buy this movie in addition to The Patriot in some feeble attempt to save money.  Overall you'll just be wasting it because The Patriot is quite the opposite of this one.
B0000009S3|5.0|Zappa liked to run his mouth and he liked to ruin great compositions with awful lyrics, but Hot Rats was spared of this and what a blessing that is as it is possibly the greatest Jazzy Rock instrumental album to ever be released. The compositions/improvs are awesome, the songs are not only worth study for musicians but are extremely catchy,compelling and never bore. I have had this album for several years and never grow tired of listening to it. No matter what the length of the songs, they always feel so short as this album just takes one to another place. The one track with vocals \\"Willy the Pimp\\" is an awesome, bluesy track featuring none other than Zappa friend and artistic genius Captain Beefheart aka Don Van Vliet on lead vocals and Doc Sugar Cane Harris on fiddle. Zappa proves himself to be a brilliant guitarist, improviser and composer via this masterpiece. All songs are great, but the two biggest standouts are Son of Mr. Green Genes (probably the greatest song that Zappa ever penned) and the extended jazz, blues and rock fusion masterwork Gumbo Variations. Oh, and don't be surprised if it takes you weeks to get the infectious Peaches en Regalia out of your head. I also recommend (for starters,by Zappa) The Grand Wazoo, Shut Up and Play Your Guitar, and Yellow Shark. He truly is one of the world's most underappreciated and greatest composers.
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|I am a huge John Waters film and this one was always one of my absolute favorites, because he was allowed to make a huge, big budget fun musical and the film has a pace and an energy that is wonderful.<br /><br />My problem with this Director's Cut is, just like the new Coyote Ugly disc, I don't mind the extra scsnes being put back in, but they seemed sort of shoved into the film as opposed to being integrated into it. Also, some of the ne shots and lines truly disrupt the pace of the scene and call attention to themselves as opposed to merely fleshing out the scene more.<br /><br />The best scene added to was the courtroom scene with more of the parents that helped clarify alot of things, including the imfamous F word joke.<br /><br />So, all in all, some of it really works and other things kinda muck it all up and that is upsetting.<br /><br />But in you do get a great Waters commentary and a 45 minute retrospective and those always a blast.<br /><br />I guess my disappointment lies with the fact that I'm going to have to keep my VHS copy of this film too, as opposed to other director's cuts when I can give the original VHS to friends or sell it on ebay.
014028009X|4.0|The only reason I won't give this book 5 stars is because Fielding admits to copying Pride and Prejudice - so Jane Austen (one of the founding mothers of Chic-lit) deserves that 5th star.<br /><br />HOWEVER, this book is a great summer read, and goes well with the film (the film made me read the book eventhough a friend of mine had it a couple years prior and I ignored her raves...) and Bridget just seems greater than other chic-lit protagonists because she doesn't have anything fall into place AT ALL, and she says, \\"yeah, I'm overweight and my bra digs into my skin and I smoke too much and - ooooh is that chocolate?  I think I'll have some vodka to wash it down.\\"  she's great.<br /><br />One thing: the mother character seriously bugs me.  Be ready for an overly obnoxious immature mom who is unfaithful to her husband of 30+ years.  lame.
0151008787|5.0|This memoir is a triumph on multiple levels. First, it is the story of a young man's growing up in a period of history fraught with tragedy and hope -- the time just after the Holocaust and before the State of Israel was founded and took root. Oz blends the personal and the political in a seamless manner. His account of his adolescent sexual fumblings and his eventual initiation into sexual activity by an older woman is both psychologically convincing and utterly hilarious. Second, this is the account of a new nation, Israel, struggling to be born and to forge its identity. Oz grew up as an acolyte of the political Zionist Right; it is remarkable that he moved decisively to the Left and remained there. He is a Zionist who feels deep and genuine empathy with the Arab populace. Third, many reviewers have not pointed out that this is a literary memoir. From almost the day that he learned to read, Oz devoured the classic and not-so-classic works of world literature -- whatever had been translated into Hebrew. In some ways, this book is Oz's effort to acknowledge his literary ancestors and repay his literary debts. The language is lyrical and the sense of history is pervasive. Altogether an outstanding book.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Once again I'm reviewing another movie that was completely overrated.  Completely overquoted.  Napoleon Dynamite is a movie about a nerd, his nerd brother, and his 2 nerd friends.  It's an original idea and has a different feel for it than most independent films and is, i grant you, better than quite a few indies, but overall it just WASN'T that good.  If you're one of those people sitting there saying, \\"Hey it won MTV movie awards best movie of the year!\\" ... give me a break.  This movie was MADE by MTV, of course they're going to give it a better rating than anyone ELSE in the WORLD.  Not to mention MTV is just a ridiculous channel anyway, MUSIC television anyone?  I don't want to watch shows consisting of idiot celebrity marriages, celebrity houses, and celebrities getting pranked, err umm, \\"punk'd\\".
B000000W5P|5.0|Though 'Tattoo You' was probably their last really good album, this is their last truly great album, but man (or woman if you're into the whole politically correct thing) is it a great one! 'Some Girls' has elements of funk, disco, pop, and of course hardcore rock and blues. The execution is, as always, flawless, and the song writing, as on the greatest Stones albums, is top-notch. There isn't a single bit of filler, not a single bad track. It's tough to say any songs particularly stand out on such an amazing album, though it did yield several Stones classics. The album opens with the ultra-cool and catchy, yet simultaneously poppy and disco-like (yes, the Stones can even make disco sound good) 'Miss You', followed by the raunchy and bluesier 'When the Whip Comes Down'. Third is the slower, yet brilliant cover of 'Just My Imagination' and fourth comes the title track, which is an absolute gem. Faraway Eyes, Respectable, and Before they Make Me Run are lesser known but equally great tracks and the album closes with two more classics, Beast of Burden and the funky Shattered. If not the Stones at their best, this album is pretty close; hey even at their worst they're better than most of the stuff than people are listening to now.
B00006690G|4.0|I was originally dissapointed with this album...I kinda let this cd sit on top of a pile of laundry for a few years until I actually listened to it again after his last album \\"Encore\\". Compared to Encore, the Eminem Show is much more cohesive and better thought out. Yeah, there are some tracks like Drips and Hallie's Song that shoulda been left off the cd, but gems like \\"Till I Collapse\\", \\"Soldier\\", \\"Saying Goodbye to Hollywood\\" and \\"Square Dance\\" wipe out any track on Encore. Hopefully on Em's next LP he will eliminate any of the crap like \\"Just Lose It\\" and \\"Big Weenie\\" that destroyed Encore. Purchase Eminem Show or his earlier work instead of his recent disaster. <br /> <br />
B0001XAPZ6|2.0|This film is my favorite anime of all time! But this DVD version, released by Disney, is absolutely horrible. The picture and audio are flat and obviously were not digitally remastered. The original release looks and sounds better than this version. It looks like they copied the old video (aged 20 years), quickly dubbed in English parts, slapped it in a new package, and then charged double for it.  <br /> <br />Except for Patrick Stewarts part, the acting on the English voiceovers are dreadful as well. The butchered US version released in the 80's is better then this version. I waited forever for this to be released, excited about Disney releasing it in all it's original glory, shame on you Disney for releasing this.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|I think it's probably safe to say (now that the Matrix trilogy is over) that Keanu Reeves is simply one of the most overrated actors ever.  All he does is sit around acting exactly like he did in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (no joke one of top ten worst movies of all time).  Rachel Weisz is actually surprisingly good in this movie and would have been better if she didn't have such a terrible co-worker but i guess there's nothing anyone can do about that so we'll move on to the plot.  Good, overall.  Some things were fairly lacking though, and also some were completely unnecessary (stuff that happens in the end i don't want to give away in this review).  Overall, would be 4 stars but Keanu definitely knocks it down a bar.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This show, if you'll pardon my french, is simply awesomtastic. It's a cross between Buffy, Desparate Housewives and The O.C. and it outclasses all of them. Stunning performances by Kristen Bell and stories that are remarkably well-written for a teen-centric show. I was blown away when I first saw it, and still am. Definitely one of the best shows on television.
037571457X|5.0|I read it al in two days. it was good. I enjoyed it. Probably the first school book I liked.
0822216310|5.0|It would appear many of stories are somewhat based off the authors life. Some of the stories are just sarcastic takes on society and how people act though. I liked this book, the first of the authors I had ever read. I was compelled to make my purchase after hearing the author on NPR giving an interview and reciting a few paragraphs from the Santaland story. I wasn't disappointed. If you like to l laugh and think, this is for you. It probably helps to be a bit jaded and appreciate a darker humor.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Tarantino is terrible if you wish to know more on this check out my review of the sequel to this movie.  I can't believe you can buy the star wars trilogy with this movie, that's absolutely ridiculous.  One good series, and the beginning of a terrible one.
B00005LC3Y|5.0|This film was not originally a widescreen movie. Most Stanley Kubrick movies are not widescreen including his last movie EYES WIDE SHUT.  <br /> <br />So, stop complaining and get this DVD if you like the movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|In Firefly, Joss Whedon provided his own unique vision and talents to the SF genre, only to be bushwhacked by short-sighted Fox executives. Now you have a chance to view the series the way it was meant to be seen, in the correct order in with all unshown episodes resored. Firefly is a wonderfully poignant and entertaining show about nine people who survive and thrive, squabble and mend. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD set; I feel you will agree that you will consider it the best purchase you make this year.
0393324818|5.0|Michael Lewis didn't start off looking for the work he presented with \\"Moneyball,\\" but couldn't have done better otherwise. He meticulously lays out the career of Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's. <br /> <br />Beane, as you learn early on, was an absolute can't miss prospect when he was drafted by the Mets. He had all the tools, and some considered taking him ahead of Darryl Strawberry. Mentally, he never quite put it together and was a career backup hitting about .280. <br /> <br />Beane learns from his own disappointing career and bases his choices not on who looks good and has the tools, but instead who gets on base and who avoids making outs. <br /> <br />Lewis' analysis of the system answers the question of how the A's have consistently won so much while spending so little. Where the book shines, though, is its generous space to tell the stories of these ballplayers who are castoffs in every MLB city other than Oakland. <br /> <br />Beane's not perfect as a GM, and he never claimed to discover on-base percentage. He's just somebody who uses a different system, trading away the skills he feels are overrated and stocking up on the skills that are undervalued, in order to tip the odds in his team's favor. <br /> <br />If the other 300 positive reviews haven't persuaded you to buy this book, you're truly missing out on a great sports story.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|This movie was fun to watch....I will be honest...I know there is a comic book based on the movie....and I'm thinking the people who didn't like the movie were the people who have read the comic book? Well...anyway...I loved the movie...it had a gothic, scary, dark theme to it. The movie is not boring at all....I think it's one of the best movies that came out at the begining of this year (2005).
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Hmmm. <br /> <br />Mesmerize is a good album, there's no denying that fact - it's full of catchy riffs and great melodies, which makes it very accessible. Which is exactly the problem - what happened to the originality and style of their first self-titled album?  <br /> <br />Compare Suite-Pee or Ddevil to Radio/Video or Lost In Hollywood for example. The latter tracks follow normal song structure a lot more than the other older tracks - System Of A Downs new work is still original, but nowhere near as much as it used to be. <br /> <br />I'm hoping Hypnotize will reconcile my view of SOAD - I will be disappointed if it follows the example of Mesmerize. <br /> <br />On the other hand, it's great to see Daron Malakian getting some extra vocal time - he's a great singer and it's about time he got a bit of the spotlight. And what's this about his voice being 'too normal', not as good as Tankian? What about BYOB and Cigaro? <br /> <br />Overall, a good album, but not as good as their first album or toxicity.
0679721037|5.0|Reading this book felt like I was transported back to August 6, 1945. The events on that day and the days following were horrific! Hersey's accounts were so vivid and well-documented that I even felt like I was experiencing the explosion first-hand, (but from six different perspectives). At times, some of the accounts were very disturbing, while others, heartbreaking. However, these accounts opened my eyes to the realities of what could happen if there should ever be a Hiroshima repeat, or worst--nuclear warfare. I definitely recommend this book, not just for the mind-blowing experience, but also for its great literature.
B00005IC2H|5.0|A while ago actually. I'm real late on this review. why even review it you might ask? because Im bored and I decided that for the 6 people that stuble across this page, they will see another 5 star review. Sigur Ros have made the best cd of all time. \\"what? are you crazy? the best cd of all time is ...\\" well Im sorry but you are wrong. its ok, you are just stupid because this is amazing and life changing and after 5 years of learning more old and new music, it is hard to find a cd that even measures up. I would give it a million stars out of 5 if I could but that would just round out to 5. It is alien classical from the future. \\"how so?\\" you ask. why do you talk so much is my question. then I would slap you and say here. I would put you in a room with large, powerful speakers, come back in 70 minutes with a fresh pair of pants for you and then say \\"Iceland\\". the lyrics are good  even. I cheated and found a translation. best cd ever. Im done raving. why does 2005 suck for music anyawy.
B0007O38F8|4.0|Straight fire, with killer beats on every track. Definately a contender forBest Album of 2005. I don't feel all the G-Unit buzz and everything (Even though I own every G-Unit album), but there's no denying that this album is fire. <br /> <br />1. Intro <br />2. In My Hood (5/5) <br />3. This Is 50 (4/5 - Nice beat by Sha Money and Black Jeruz) <br />4. I'm Supposed to Die Tonight (5/5 - Nice hook) <br />5. Piggy Bank (5/5) <br />6. Gatman and Robbin feat. Eminem (5/5 - NaNaNaNaNaNa! Gatman!) <br />7. Candy Shop feat. Olivia (2/5 - From Da club to the Candy Shop) <br />8. Outta Control (5/5 - Killa beat, remix sucks) <br />9. Get in My Car (5/5 - Hi-Tek! Haha!) <br />10. Ski Mask Way (5/5 - Disco D gets a nice beat with a nice female loop sampling) <br />11. Baltimore Love Thing (3/5 - Nice lyrics, not a  good 50-type-love song) <br />12. Ryder Music (3/5 - Slower beat, but nice by 50) <br />13. Disco Inferno (1/5) <br />14. Just a Lil Bit (4/5) <br />15. Gunz Come Out  (5/5) <br />16. My Toy Soldier feat. Tony Yayo (5/5 - Produced by Em) <br />17. Position of Power (4/5) <br />18. Build You Up (3/5 - Interesting beat, bad sampling, not that good a performence by fifty) <br />19. God Gave Me Style (4/5) <br />20. So Amazing feat. Olivia (5/5 - Produced by J.R., Olivia KILLS this one, unlike Candy Shop) <br />21. I Don't Need 'Em (5/5 - A beat used very often, and 50 kills it, especially the hook) <br />22. Hate It or Love It [G Unit Remix] feat. The Game, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo & Young Buck (4/5 - 50, Banks, Game do good, Yayo's is weak and Buck's is short. Not nearly as good as the original) <br /> <br />Only songs I skip are Baltimore Love Thing, Disco Inferno and Candy Shop.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Five hundred years from now, we have a crew of a star ship. They are not out to explore strange new worlds, not contact new civilizations. They are out to make a fast buck and are not finicky about legalities in doing so. Firefly was a kind of space western with situations and dialogue that were top notch. (Example: The Captain of the star ship retorts to one of his crew, \\"I'm pissed off and heavily armed, so why are we having this conversation?\\"<br /><br />(...)<br />It was too bad that the network put the series in a bad time slot, showed the episodes out of order, and then cancelled the series before it could find an audience. It may turn out to be the biggest programming blunder since NBC cancelled the first Star Trek.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|I saw this movie a few weeks ago, and I still can't get it off my mind! It's just one of those movies that sticks with you long after you've seen it. I knew I should have watched it a second time around before I brought it back, but it is some what exhausting to watch, so I just wasn't up to it. But I will definetly be renting it again, to see what I missed the first time around, and to tie up any loose ends that I still haven't wrapped my brain around. Incidently, my husband hasn't slept well since he saw The Machinist, and he's putting the blame on it (I don't buy his excuse)...but it probably isn't for everyone... it is definetly what you would call a dark movie. If that's your thing (...it's mine, if it's done right) then I say check this movie out. It was very well done, from start to finish. And of course you can't miss the amazing, shrunken Mr. Bale (...Christian Bale, who plays the main character and is one of my favorite actors...if you like him in this movie, then I highly recommend the movie \\"American Psycho\\"...excellent!), who lost sooo much weight for this role. I still haven't decided if he's just crazy, or so amazingly dedicated to his craft. Either way...he deserves more recognition than he gets.
B000002542|5.0|I had liked the newer Steve Perry Journey, and I knew nothing about their first three albums with Greg Rollie at that time, so I asked my dad to burn them for me, and they were great. ''Of A lIfetime'' is one of the best songs I've ever heard. This album is as good as, probably beteer, than anything with Stevie.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I've never reviewed a DVD show before, but I can't resist. In a season when all these new dramas zoomed in, this little gem takes the cake. Smart writing, great cultural references, superior acting (call out to Kristin Bell as Veronica, Jason Dohring as Logan and Enrico Coltani as Veronica's father). I borrowed DVDs from a friend as was immediately hooked.  <br /> <br />Don't think of this as Nancy Drew Goes 90210. It's much better than that. Its dark plotting and intense emotions puts it in league with Deadwood, Six Feet Under, West Wing, maybe X-Files before it sucked. It's not just for Buffy fans either-though it has a strong, young blonde heroine, it goes beyond that sort of culty, sci-fi world. VM is just well-plotted, romantic, surprising, sexy, amazing. To not watch is to miss one of the best things you'll ever seen on television..really.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|This review is kind of long but trust me it is worth your time. Don't get me wrong, the music on these cds are great, it's just not enough. Not nearly enough.    Last year, I realized my true love for Bruce Springsteen's music. Now at the age of 17 (almost 18), I own all of his studio albums save the Pete Seeger tribute. But when I was considering buying his cds last year, I had a dilemma: Should I buy this or another compilation, or should I buy some of his studio albums. I choose the latter, buying my way from Greetings to Born in the USA, since I already had Tunnel of Love, The Rising, and Devils and Dust.     I made the right move. I was blown away by the progression of his musical intricity and flow from album to album, all while retaining the same raw emotion. I later went and bought Human Touch, Lucky Town, and Ghost of Tom Joad.    If you are a hardcore fan like me, just buy his studio albums if you already haven't because that is the only thing that will satisfy your love for The Boss.     If you want to get into Bruce more, hold off on this collection or any other greatest hits type deal, because chances are you already know a good deal of his popular songs (If you don't you've been living under a rock). Trust me it would be worth it just to buy a select number of studio albums and work your way from there. I'd start with these five:    The Wild, The Innocent, and The E Street Shuffle- his second album, and my favorite; it features a lot of cool \\"epics\\" that tell stories of love, good times, and turmoil of young adults.    Born to Run- This is really when he comes into his own musically and becomes popular. It features many songs that people can relate to regarding relationships and lifestyles.    Darkness on The Edge of Town- Same as above.    Tunnel of Love- The most personal Bruce album, talking about the relationships that people go through in their lives. A great, softer side of The Boss.    The Rising- Arguably the best cd of the new millenium, it was written in response to 9/11 and features songs describing what is going on amongst the people affected by 9/11. He also has a few classic Bruce songs thrown into the mix.    That might sound like a lot, but it will be $50 well spent. Trust me. I was satisfied and so will you. This way you can make your own compilation of your favorite Springsteen songs like I have done. I made a 75 song playlist on my ipod of my favorite Boss songs, and I still feel like I haven't done him justice!    Just one more thing. If you have a problem with Bruce's politics, don't shy away from him. I don't agree with a lot of what he says, yet I have never NOT been able to enjoy any of his music because of this. I have not found one song of his offensive to me. I'll be dead honest, The Rising is the most Patriotic album I have EVER heard. So please, put aside your political beliefs for a while and enjoy Bruce Springsteen for the unbelievable music he brings to the table.    Coming from a young person whose generation has brought us some of the worst music imaginable, it is my priveledge to be able to listen to a musician as talented as Bruce Springsteen.
B000002KMY|4.0|The Mob Rules had a lot of great songs on it. It was basically a heavier, more commercial sounding album then Heaven and Hell was. While Heaven and Hell had a late 70s classic rock feel to it, this album has a more 80's heavy metal feel to it. This is probably the heaviest Black Sabbath album ever, 'Born Again' was heavy too, but it was too sloppy and the production and mixing s*cked, but 'Mob Rules' has awesome production for a early 80's metal record. Come to thnk of it, this album actaully sounds more akin to solo Dio then Sabbath, sounds alot more modern, polished and heavy then anything the band had done before. <br />
B0009XNUK0|1.0|This is nothing more than a wholly transparent attempt to maximize a return on damaged goods. Michael Jackson is so over.  Buy this rehashed garbage CD if you must, but there is nothing new on it. For those of you who may not know this, Michael Jackson didn't even write his biggest hit Thriller.  Rod Temperton of Heatwave fame did.
B000002UDB|5.0|If you'de like to have a great musical experience, you need to check out this record!!!  it's absolutly classic & amazing!  The first of it's kind!  This record was experimental at the time of it's release and has become a classic over the past few decades.  It's just a great album.  I can't say enough about it.  Please give it a listen, you will more then likely love it!
B000002IR9|5.0|How can anybody from Georgia - even the South - not think that Carla Thomas & Otis Redding are sui generis. The song \\"Tramp\\" with their clever exchange of lyrics, and gold digger/dirt farmer jokes is a hoot. \\"Otis,\\" says Carla, \\"you ain't nuthin' but country.\\" Otis replies, \\"That's right, baby. Yes I is.\\" She complains, \\"You can't buy me diamonds or minks.\\" And he comes back, \\"Why, woman, I can buy you anything you want - rat, squirrell, frog, anything!\\" The romantic songs are as good as it gets, as well.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|IT'S TIME IS LIKE A SMORGASBOARD OF DELIGHTFUL MUSICAL TREATS SERVED WITH SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. <br /> <br />I ABSOLUTELY LOVED #8 SAVE THE LAST DANCE FOR ME AND #1 FEELING GOOD. I CAN'T HELP BUT CRY WHEN I HEAR MICHAEL'S HEARTFELT SINGING OF #5 HOME AND #11 SONG FOR YOU.
0800141849|5.0|I'm no particular Barbra Streisand fan, but I absolutely loved this  movie. Streisand and Bridges both give fantastic performances but what really sends the movie to the top is the final scene and funnily enough the credits where Streisand and Bridges dance to the  song \\"I've finally found someone\\". I suppose some critics will say I'm nuts, but I'm thinking of adding this to my top ten favourite films of all time. <br /> <br />BTW folks, \\"Barbra\\" has two \\"a\\"s, not three.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I like this cd much better than her first release.  Avril rocks on this cd with songs such as..Don't tell me, Take me away and Freak out. I love Avril's melodic sound and powerfull voice.
B00082IJ08|4.0|First off, this album isnt as great as the first...it might take a while to get into it but when you're into it, its awesome. I really like this album and uh...you should too, it might be weird but its brilliant
B0009H1CK6|5.0|This DVD concert turned out to be great the only thing missing from my room was smoke and thousands of people up against each other. My DVD had 2 rough spots but other than that it was a good purchase and one of the best ole school concerts to date.
B000660UN0|5.0|As Clapton says on the DVD, a musician could spend his whole life exploring the music of Robert Johnson and trying to play it \\"right\\". That is what is so interesting about the DVD in this collection, the fact that Eric gives the viewer so much insight into what Robert Johnson means (and has always meant) to him. Their careers parallel each other in many ways except that Clapton survived his reckless youth while Johnson did not. But Eric notes in one of the many mini-interviews on the DVD that he, like Johnson, went away for several months, hiding out in a room and practicing guitar several hours a day until he could play it the way he wanted to play. Johnson, back in the late 20s or early 30s, did the same after legendary blues player Son House laughed at his way  <br /> <br />of playing guitar. In that sense, Johnson and Clapton are the same because Eric has always stood up to his critics by improving on whatever weaknesses they thought he might have. <br /> Clapton makes it clear on the DVD that he can't play Roberts' songs the exact way Johnson did but during performances either solo or with Bramhill, he captures the essence of those songs and explains that these songs truly\\"put me in the moment\\". <br /> I could go on and on but other reviewers here have hit the mark, especially the guy who was diappointed with the Me & Mr. Johnson album but delighted with this one because of the DVD and the acoustic versions of many of Johnsons' songs. Being a Johnson/Clapton fan for years and years, this tribute is a double bonus. I onlywishCream had done more Johnson tunes way back when.....
B00082IJ08|5.0|This is a very unique album ! It hits on every genre and period of music. The songs have a 70's,60's flair to them with touch of Hip Hop electronica ! Not very familiar with the 1st lp but I liked the song \\"Tommorrow Comes today \\". This cd is very interesting a jewel in my Cd collection ! \\"Kids with guns\\" s personally my favorite ! It reminds me of a throw back 60's track with a electronic feel to it ! And there's a song on there El' something ? It is a really, really nice song ! \\"All alone\\" is another stand out with \\"Martina Topley bird\\" on it ! It has a old school Timbaland feel to it ! Those that are not familiar with her she was Tricky's vocal/Muse on his first 3 and best 3 cd's ! This album is interesting don't sleep ! <br /> <br />A
B00000FCBC|5.0|Garage Days is a great great great album. With all their cover songs and remakes from the old days to the new days. James knocks it out with his voice on ''Turn the Page,Die,Die,My Darling,and Tuesday's Gone'' Just to name a few. It also includes one of my most favorite songs ever ''The Small Hours'' on disc 2 an awsome song and proves Newsted was a masterful bass player. Even the song ''Am I Evil?'' from the Kill Em All days is breathtaking with Dave Mustaine's guitar solo. This is a must have for any MetallicA fan, Get it not now...but NOW!! :) LONG LIVE METAL!!!!!!!
B000001GY9|5.0|Schumann's symphonies are VERY difficult to conduct well. The leader must be able to produce a deep sense of spirituality along with great freshness and charm. Modern conductors simply fall flat in these works - their generic approaches are good as far as they go, but it's like reading Homer in an English prose translation - useful, but oh my how much is missing!<br /><br />  Bernstein made a number of recordings with the Vienna and they are overall of a very high standard. The Schumann performances may be the equal of any, and certainly go a long way in establishing him as deserving of his stature - a very great conductor. If you are looking for a better set don't waste your time or money - there simply isn't one. The Szell performances are also especially good, but Bernstein is able to lighten up the orchestra's heavy full sonority at will to miraculous effect. The engineers have captured a rich golden color most appropriate to Schumann's orchestra sound. Please - don't pass these up!
6305252572|4.0|While I don't agree that this movie still holds up after 20 something years, it is still a classic example of a pairing of unlikely allies, in this case an ex-con and a cop on the edge. Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte give dynamite performances. And while the movie has an unexpectedly high level of violence, the comedy shines through. Eddie Murphy's brilliant scene in a redneck bar is unforgetable.
B00004XONN|5.0|Well I just wrote a review of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot comparing it to the Radiohead album so I may as well write my thoughts on Kid A. Radiohead's great millenium album, much as Wilco's, was a record that helped to blow my mind about what music could be. I was a very young 18 when I first heard this album and was, of course, very accostomed and attached to The Bends and OK Computer. This album came out and I didn't know to do. I listened to it many times. It probably took me two or three years to even begin diving under the surface and grasping the dark Finnegan Wake-like world of the album. Even now, I don't think this album is completely communicable. This is not to say I want this album to be completely communicable. I want the arcanum, the enigma, the mystery. And also, this is not to say this album is inaccessible. Like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and even Sgt. Peppers and Stankonia this album is totally immersed in it's own peculariarities and yet somehow can be appealing to anyone. Anyone willing to lift the veil that is. As with YHF, going into individual songs on an album of this magnitude is futile. Get it and listen to it, by yourself, in its entirety. It is NOT  a difficult album, you just have to LISTEN.  Advocates of The Bends will tell you otherwise. I will not dispute the brilliance of the Bends, but Kid A is not THAT far from it, people just overreact after one listen. A mistake. Kid A has more subtle nuances that ask to be probed. To put it in the most trite way possible: experience it, then form an opinion.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I still enjoy listening to this CD and truly admire Carole King for whom she is-a brilliantly talented songwriter and singer whose music touches the heart. She is a wonderful storyteller with an earthy, soulful voice, whose songs are bursting with a spectrum of feelings-pain, despair, joy, et al. Whenever I hear this album, it takes me right back to 1971 when I first heard it and was immediately enamored with Carole King and her music.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Of the few sonic masterpieces of this century this one emerges as the American document. Perhaps only Radiohead's Kid A captures the same musical, enigmatic momentum as this record. In fact, to stupidly simplify and compare, this is in actuality the American-Midwest Kid A, just as Summer Teeth was the Midwest OK Computer. From the first shivering skysraper melodic quivers of I am Trying to Break Your Heat to the the final creaky ship sounds that fade out on Reservations, this record probes the depths of every gin-juiced, cigarrete burnt,Cranian, Dylan-esque, post 9-11 piece of pathos and heartache imaginable. Jeff Tweedy's voice beckons from the bottom of a compassionate bottle of whiskey and recites words reflective of the greatest American lyricists, both musical and literary. Hart Crane and Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan and even Ginsberg scribble beautiful lugubrious telepathic sounds on Tweedy's tongue and out emanate these breathtaking songs. One of the few albums (along with Kid A) of the last 15 years that I must listen to not only in its entirety, but also completely alone, singing my heart out to the idiosyncratic but arcanely accessible melancholy stains of this album. Rolling Stone didn't even put this album on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. It is one of the the greatest albums ever, do not beleive them. Go obtain it, and enrich your life.
B0000636UN|4.0|My favorite Sheryl Crow record, without question, is her eponymous title of a few years ago, wherein she indulged in Liz Phair-style whimsy like \\"Maybe Angels.\\"<br /><br />That sort of spirit -- as well as Phair herself -- shows up at times on this new album, but for the most part, \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" feels like a somewhat downbeat party to which Crow has invited her all-star friends. For the most part, they blend in invisibly with Crow and her back-up performers, and don't bring much to the party. It's nice to know Stevie Nicks is staying out of trouble, but she doesn't add much to the album, for instance.<br /><br />When Sheryl Crow one day assembles a greatest hits album, \\"Soak Up The Sun\\" and \\"Steve McQueen\\" will make it onto that album, but the rest of this work won't get a second look.<br /><br />This is a good album for ardent Crow fans, but those new to her music would be better advised to pick up her debut album or her aforementioned self-titled work.
B000003TAR|5.0|Indeed a defiant recording, only slightly compromised (if such a thing exists) in that Heart Shaped Box and All Apologies were re-mixed to appease the band's major label (DGC). Nonetheless, this album documents one of the greatest rock star tantrums ever, on par with anything Lennon bemoaned.he comparison is a poignat one. Lennon and Cobain had a creepy amount of things in common, but perhaps for the msic fan none is more cogent than their egual ability to synthesis their psycho-sexual, angst knotted and love yearning souls into gorgeous, calorie-free rock morsels, entwined with blood, cum and rock and roll soul. Not only does the the music conjure these bodily splattered images, but the lyrics also offer words influenced by a Burroughsian clinical obsession with viatmin deficiencies, junk dependency, incontinency, scab tears, womb burns, fetuses coughing consumptive pre-gestation. The music on this album introduced me, as an early teen, to rock music of passion and intelligence. The lyrics on this album made me want to be a writer, a poet, made me seek out other writers. And I am still a writer, and this album will always be brilliant.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|When White Wolf Game Systems sued the makers of \\"Underworld\\" for ripping off their world, with its highly social and politicized vampires who sleep for eons and their violent emnity with werewolves, it was assumed it was because they were trying to cash in on WWGS' World of Darkness.<br /><br />Yes and no.<br /><br />\\"Underworld\\" is theoretically about vampires and werewolves, but honestly, it mostly ends up being leather-clad people shooting fancy guns at other leather-clad people. In other words, it devolves into the worst sort of World of Darkness game, with angsty gun-toting idiots killing other angsty gun-toting idiots over something that probably made sense at the beginning of the evening, but eventually just becomes an excuse for posturing and gunplay.<br /><br />In the DVD extras, one of the creators of the film says \\"Underworld\\" might be one of the best vampire movies ever made. This might be true if no other vampire movies ever had been made. As it is, it's not the worst ever -- the \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" movie holds onto the left end of the bell curve with a death grip -- but this confused, muddled and ultimately pointless film isn't much better than mediocre, at the end of the day.<br /><br />Vampire fans are advised to check out \\"Near Dark,\\" \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula,\\" \\"From Dusk Til Dawn\\" or even \\"Fright Night\\" or \\"Lost Boys\\" for a better vampire experience.<br /><br />A rental at best. A recommended buy only for the most diehard World of Darkness fans.
0802130208|4.0|Imagine a massively obese middle-aged man, who always wears the same hunting cap and parka, living in a small shack with his mother, and handwriting his magnum opus on the decline of the West since the glorious medieval era.  His mother constantly hounds him to find gainful employment, leading him to bizarre misadventures as an office clerk and hot dog vendor.  How could this situation not be funny?<br /><br />Some reviewers talk about the latent sadness in this book.  It's hard to see, unless you empathize with Ignatius, or imagine that the author empathized with him.  I myself empathized with Ignatius-- perhaps a little too strongly-- as I read this book during a period of unemployment and have always had academic aspirations.  Some will easily discredit and dismiss Ignatius and his pen pal Myrna-- but isn't it somewhat sad that someone as astute and creative as Ignatius won't find a place in this world unless he fits into some kind of occupational niche?<br /><br />But hey, maybe I'm being a bit too heavy-- the book's damn funny.  My favorite scene: when Ignatius writes a fake letter, pretending to be his boss, threatening to \\"lash the pathetic shoulders\\" of an unsatisfied customer.  If only one could be so bold and brazen in the working world.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Brad Anderson has the potential to be that rare breed of artist: a great horror movie director.  This breed is even rarer nowadays, when the temptation of big budget Hollywood crapfests like \\"Scream\\" and \\"The Exorcist III:The Beginning\\" loom so large, promising millions for anyone involved just as long as<br /><br />the blood flows aplenty, the actresses are well known and have bra sizes exceeding the standard, and some reference to great horror flicks of old are contained in the title/dialogue.<br /><br />\\"The Machinist\\", when all the desperate illusions are stripped away, is essentially about a man in denial.  Christian Bale's performance as Trevor Reznick, a not-so-generic industrial worker, is so good that at times he is actually frightening.  Not having slept in a year, his ghostly existence is punctuated only by moments of hope.  He looks like he just escaped from a Nazi death camp, and becomes more pale and impoverished as the film rolls on.  The observant viewer will notice more than a little of Dostoevsky in this film: at one point we catch Trevor reading \\"The Idiot\\" at home, a book which in fact is entirely inappropriate for his real situation.  Later on, in a very fleeting moment, we see \\"Crime and Punishment\\", which is much more appropriate.  This film could easily be seen from a religious angle, although I think this would be wrong: Trevor is an ascetic of the most dementedly enthusiastic sort, throwing himself in front of cars and immolating his life in a thousand ways in order to atone for an act which can can never be really forgiven.<br /><br />The meaning of the movie aside, everything about it is so Kafka-esque, laced with paranoia of the most dreadful kind, and hallucinatory that one is hooked from the moment the film begins.  During the course of it a man loses his arm due to Trevor's \\"negligence\\": he goes on a Halloween carnival ride which quickly becomes an excrutiating peek into his tortured subconscious:and above all, he engages in a strange pursuit of Ivan, a tall, bald, recklessly honest figure, the one factor in his life he desperately wants to be rid of.<br /><br />Far better than \\"Memento\\", which I believe it is patterned after somewhat, this is yet another horror masterpiece by Brad Anderson.  Not to be missed.strange pursuit of Ivan, a tall, bald, recklessly honest figure, the one factor in his life he desperately wants to be rid of. <br /> <br />Far better than \\"Memento\\", which I believe it is patterned after somewhat, this is yet another horror masterpiece by Brad Anderson.

B0007NFL18|4.0|This album is aiight yu know, because i didn't reallie think 50 would b able 2 do it again. I givv him credit, because he had to come back into rapping and try to make a better album then his first (which was basically impossible) but you know it was an attempt and the album is great. 50 is still rapping about the drugs, guns, sex and all that. but he approaches someting different, he has much slower tracks and less features in the song. He still has many party songs such as disco inferno and candy shop, and just a lil bit but his album just isnt as good. His second song in my hood remains the same formula as his other album and at the end it leaves you with a treat from a saxaphone solo, A Baltimore Love thing is probably the suprise of the album he role-plays a drug on this track, my personal favourite is Ryder music which i thought had the best beat and the best flow. I also noticed that 50's voice has changed in this album then the first. His voice is more deeper and less goofy sounding (although i still liked how he sounded in his other album).
B000002LIM|5.0|'Batman' the movie was fantastic. The music? Even better! The music aswell with the theme plays a great role in this film, including the sequel 'Batman Returns' by same director Tim Burton. It sets the mood for what the Dark Knight has always beem characterized for and definitely will make you feel you're in for a ride. <br /> <br />As a Batman fan, and a Danny Elfman fan I couldn't be more pleased with this score, making truly my favorite just like my title states it. It takes a genius like Elfman to compose a theme like this one. All the tracks are incredibley genuine and are worth every cent that you paid for this album. <br /> <br />It's really sad that the theme couldn't follow 'Batman Forever' and 'Batman and Robin' but at the same time I don't think those two movies could deserve an excelent score like this one.
0765348780|4.0|First of all, it is satifying to see a Canadian Author be recognized by virtue of their talent. Unfortunately he had to publish from the U.K. in order to do this. The only other way was to publish through an American House. Canadian Publishers are into the Anal retentive varieties that are \\"Literary Hallmarks\\" unreadable, indigestible (Pierre Burton Excepted) and occupy Library shelves amid copious quantities of Dust.<br /><br />This book was a gift from my daughter as I had not wanted to get into another Jordanesque marathon where the later volumes will be a chapter of new thought wrapped around twenty-five chapters of filler.<br /><br />The book grabs you and does not let go. It,s characters are not the elites of other titles nor part of the priviledged minority as in other more familiar titles. This one walks the talk and the imagination of the author as he delves into the \\"Malazan Empire\\" is exceptional.<br /><br />I would like to compare his writing inteligence and unique concepts to a George Martin or a Guy Gabriel Kay but it would be an injustice. Erickson is certainly at a par with these giants of the genre.<br /><br />I will take the volumes as they come and hope to enjoy as I did this one.<br /><br />A wondefull tale to set your teeth to and feast.
B000000OA6|5.0|Music comes in many forms: loud, soft, angry, potent, relaxed, moving, and passionate to name a few. Queen's \\"Innuendo\\", their last album to be recorded before Mercury passed, features some of the most emotional, passionate, and heart-felt music in history, and remains the deepest work I've ever encountered in all my years of music listening. The melodies are at times overwhelming, with Mercury lyrically persuasive, and at the same time heartrending.<br /><br />To review some of the music, we open with the self-titled track, lyrically remarkable and fervent, while also musically expressing powerful passion and emotion, setting the manner of this album suitably. \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" is possibly the most eccentric track the band ever recorded, with mind-boggling lyrics. \\"Headlong\\" is a strong rocker, a bit over-the-top, nevertheless rightous. \\"I Can't Live With You\\" is an exciting pop tune, with joyous lyrics. Don't Try So Hard has a gorgeous vocal from Mercury, in superb pitch for this passionate ballad. \\"Ride The Wild Wind\\" lacks in melody, however features impressive lyrical qualities to it. \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\" is an emotional cry to the listeners' soul, embracing us with tender lyrics and a gorgeous chorus. \\"The Hitman\\" is generally an awesome rocker, which I appreciate more than Headlong. \\"Bijou\\" features incredible guitar work, complimenting the track significantly. However, the last song \\"The Show Must Go On\\" may be the real keeper on here, and worth the price of the album alone, one of their best songs recorded, which literally clings to your soul when you hear it.<br /><br />Now, to the reason why this album received 4.5 stars. I found that tracks like \\"All God's People\\" were a little bit overdone, and lacked passion. \\"Delilah\\" has strong guitar riffs throughout, however simply isn't a memorable melody.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this album is one of Queen's classics, and should belong in any Queen fans' collection. Mercury said goodbye with one of the most emotional, passionate releases of all time. Highly recommended in the Queen catalog along with any of their albums from the 70s, Greatest Hits compilations, \\"The Game\\", and \\"The Miracle\\".l, passionate releases of all time.

B000002UAR|5.0|im 14 years old, and me and my friend are huge beatles fans. im going to see Paul McCartney on October 1st and i cant wait. Unlike most 14 year olds, i like rock that was REAL and sstarted the revolution, like the beatles, led zeppelin, the rolling stones (seeing them too), the who, the doors, the famous 50s artists (elvis, berry, jerry lee lewis, fats domino, little richard)and i also like the REAL heavy metal, liek metallica, judas priest, iron maiden, black sabbath. but anyway, to the review of this album. <br /> <br />this album is definitely one of the beatles greatest. IMO it doesnt match to its predecessor Rubber Soul, but this  is still a masterpiece. these are the tracks that stick out for me on the album:  <br /> <br />Taxman is a great song by harrison, about how the beatles realized that with the millions they were making, they were giving it away in taxes. <br /> <br />Eleanor Rigby is a classic. the great strings and great vocals, and how it was a song about death but the beatles can find a way to not make it sound bad <br /> <br />Here, There and Everywhere is a great song, one of pauls finest. <br /> <br />Yellow Submarine, its just a classic, enough said. <br /> <br />Got to get you into my life..pauls omage to drugs. great great song, and i do agree with lennon when he talked about this being some of pauls greater works. <br /> <br />Tommorow never knows,great great song, the kinda freaky intro that turns into a overall joyous song.

B000002J27|5.0|A Trick of the Tail(1976) was the turning point of Genesis. Now with Peter Gabriel gone and Phil Collins as lead vocal, A Trick of the Tail kicks it up a notch. I personally think that Phil has a smoother and softer voice than Peter Gabriel and sings more naturally. The album starts with the rocking DANCE ON A VOLCANO. Then it transcends into the beautiful ENTANGLED and the ending to this song is unbeatable(next to the Hogweed ending). SQUONK is much like the first song but just not as fast and MAD MAN MOON is Tony Banks' first composition. ROBBERY, ASSAULT, AND BATTERY is one of Genesis' fun songs. RIPPLES may be the best selection on here with its fairy tale-like atmosphere. A TRICK OF THE TAIL, the title song, is a song you would most likely hear on the radio. LOS ENDOS is the finale which combines the first two songs together.<br /><br />There is only one problem here and it has nothing to do with the songs. Starting with this album, the band starts to write less and less songs together and it remains that way until 1980's Duke.
B0007OASII|5.0|(...)    Now onto my review a REAL review of this masterpiece and one of the best new CD's to come out this year.In fact Kamelot is now my favorite band because of this CD truly they are real muscians making REAL music.This CD is a continuation of the Faust epic that was started with their previous CD Epica.From Khan's melodic voice to Casey Grillo's thunderous drums to Thomas Youngblood's killer solos and finally Glenn Barry and his pulse thumping bass this is one complete band that puts out some of the best music in metal.    1.March Of Mephisto-Unlike their previous CD's Kamelot starts out with just a straight hard edge dark song unlike their usual double bassers they start out with.Leading with backup vocals is none other then Shagrath from the black symphonic metal band Dimmu Borgir.Now I don't like black metal at all but Shagrath fits the theme of the song which starts out with marching as the evil army of Mephisto marches in unison makes you spine shiver.Roy Khan sings great as usual he's one of the best there is and he shines not only on this song but throughout the whole CD.The song has a dark vibe to it making this the darkest song Kamelot has ever done and when you combine that with some killer riffs from Youngblood,Shagrath's evil growls and a very cool solo from Stratovarius keyboardist Jens Johansson you got youself a great opener.    2.When The Lights Are Down-Now here is the tradmark double basser that Kamelot is known for.It's a supersonic song with excellent double bassing from Casey Grillo and yet another killer riffer from Thomas Youngblood and Khan's vocals soaring into the stratosphere this song is awesome plus Jens returns with yet another fine solo.    3.The Haunting(Somewhere In Time)-Now you get into the one song that got me hooked onto Kamelot.I remember seeing the video on their site and it called to me like a siren in the ocean.It's a nice mid tempo/ballad with the ever beautiful Simone Simon from Epica leanding her voice as part of a duet with Khan.It's got a nice warm rich tone and the combination of Khan's voice with the mezzo tenor voice of Simon's you got yourself a very beautiful song that you want to play over and over.    4.Soul Society-This song is underrated on the whole CD as I feel it should get more attention then some give it.It's got a nice catchy hook to it not to hard not to soft just right with Khan singing in a nice beautiful mid range.    5.Abandoned-This has got to be the most beautiful ballad I have ever heard.A nice piano intro with Khan singing in a low key emotional tone makes this a very nice and beautiful ballad my mother isn't into metal and she even likes this song.Add that with a nice solo from Mari from Masqeraid makes this one of the best ballads there is.    6.This Pain-Another underrated track much like Soul Society this one gets unnoticed by reviewer.The song has a wonderful chorus to it and Khan delivers a nice performace giving this song a nice touch.It's upbeat and packs a nice mild punch.    7.Moonlight-I like this song because it's got a nice rich tone with all the band doing a stand up job.It's that type of song that sticks into your head and doesn't leave but that's a good thing because it's a great song.    8.The Black Halo-The title track delivers a cool mid eastern sound and it's almost bombastic with some great thunderous drumming from Casey.    9.Nothing Ever Dies-An almost Queensryche feel to this song makes this song a standout.    10.Memento Mori-Now we get into the epic song of the whole CD and the longest song that Kamelot has ever done.It's the second darkest song on the CD with Shagrath coming back to add more dark tone to the song and Mari also returning to add some light tone(like a ying and yang effect)this song clocks in at almost 9 minutes and it starts out with a nice piano intro much like Abanadoned with Khan again using a low range and then picks it up with a nice mid range ala Geoff Tate.Bombastic in nature with a nice choir lending their voices and Thomas Youngblood putting out a killer solo this epic is indeed the epic of them all.    11.Serenade-We close out this masterpiece with Serenade.We start out with a keyboard intro that leads into a nice double bass from Grillo then Khan soars into the night with his tradmark melodic voice the song is a nice closer that makes you glad that you picked up this CD.    There are interludes interwoven between the songs that add a nice touch to the whole CD.With no fillers added and a stellar performance from Kamelot you have yourself a true masterpiece of fine art.So if you like melodic power metal at it's finest then pick this CD up along with Kam's other fine albums,Karma,Epica and the Fourth Legacy this is one CD that no Kamelot fan should be without.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is an awesome show! SOME OF THE BEST SFX EVER SHOWN ON VIDEO! A GREAT MOVIE!!!! BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|...It's just a show. Some say that the plot lines were bad and that everything was everywhere. But it all came together in the end and the season ended on a moment that could go two ways. Unlike the first season... This season wasn't as good, that I'll admitt but this season was amazing. Yes, Lindsey was a toy. They didn't even bring her back for Calebs funeral! WHAT WAS THAT!? Out of the four new teen characters none stayed until the end. They need to add a new character! ALSO~Bring back Hayley! She was soooo great is season 1 and 2! Yeah, she came back for the finale...and only had like 7 lines! She needs to be a main character! ALSO~ maybe this coming season will actually show us Summers entire family. Everyone's family is shown except hers! Her dad didn't even really show in this season (except for the lunch w/ Zach but he didn't do much). I hope Season 3 is better than Season 1 and 2 which were both amazing! <br /> <br />ALSO~ The music is season2 was great! From Coldplay to Death Cab, every genre was shown and in a great way. Imogen Heap's song \\"Hide & Seek\\" was used amazingly in the finale. Maybe next season we will see some new names like Anna Nalick and maybe some old faces like Rooney...
B000002H33|5.0|This was metallica's third album released in the year of 86.  Many people claim that this is their best album, although this belief is rivaled that 'RTL' is the best.  I belong to the latter crowd.  Lets get to it... <br />Battery- 5  much stronger opening song than its predecessor <br />Master of Puppets- 5 what can be said about this masterpiece <br />The Thing That Should Not Be- 3.5  too slow for my tastes <br />Sanitarium- 4  difference between good slow song and a bad one.. <br />Disposable Heroes- 3.5  good song  <br />Leper Messiah- 4   the main riff is glorious <br />Orion- 4  pretty good instrumental <br />Damage, Inc.- 1.5  terrible...possibly up there with their new stuff <br /> <br />
B00005JMEW|5.0|I am a great fan of all Tarantino movies, and this one (with volume 2) is definitely a great movie. Like all other Tarantino movies, uses an original storytelling technique. Has some violent scenes, but none of them are too offensive - maybe even a little funny. I have seen it more than 10 times, probably memorized all of the quotes but still enjoy it. You should definitely see it at least once. Great scenes, great plot, great music from a genius director...
B000002H2H|5.0|This is Metallica's second album released in 1984 and in my opinion is their best one.   <br />Fight Fire With Fire- 3.5    it's ok- not fan of vocals <br />Ride the Lightning- 4      good title track <br />For Whom the Bell Tolls- 5   classic in it's own <br />Fade To Black- 4      great song <br />Trapped Under Ice- 3   not bad- a little repetitive <br />Escape- 2      bad,bad song....horrible <br />Creeping Death- 6  personal favorite <br />Call of Ktulu- 4   instrumental <br /> <br />This may not seem like I should have rated 4.5 stars but overall this is a well-rounded album, and i would recommend it to anyones metal collection.
0060754753|5.0|This book may get more attention now, with a major anime release in theatres and headed toward DVD. Well deserved! A wonderful movie, and a wonderful book. Fans of the movie will find the book fascinating, and the changes between the story in the book and the movie interesting. I don't want to give much away for those who haven't both seen the movie and read the book, but some of the basic plot elements have changed, as well as some of the important characteristics of the principle characters. For instance, the anti-war theme in the movie really doesn't appear in the book, and Sophie's delightful magical powers don't really make it into the movie. Of course, the book contains many details and elaborations which there aren't room for in a movie. Both the movie and the book are classics, and both should be enjoyed by as many people as possible!
B000002L5I|1.0|basically... kenny wayne is one of the worst excuses for a blues guitarist ive ever seen. i mean sure hes got a little speed but he's pathetic in comparison to pretty much any other guitarist out there! seriously he can't even solo over chord changes! i've heard him compared to the likes over SRV. whoever thinks that is plain deaf. if you want some real hard hittin blues guitar.. go listen to stevie ray, freddie king, albert collins or johnny winter. i feel bad for any music fan who wastes their money on this cd.

Even though his $70 Million budget was directed to only marketing in the usa.  <br /> <br />Why doesn't everyone go to Cnet.com, go to the Downloads Section & get yourself a free Mp3 CD Ripper! <br /> <br />Then get Jackson's first 4 solo albums or really any of his albums, Make Copies of them & then BURN your own CD of your own personal choices of songs! <br /> <br />That in a nutshell is what Michael Jackson has done for 10 years! He knows his new stuff cant stand on its own so then we need Greatest Hits Packages Tagged on OR just release: Box Sets, Number ones, etc,etc..  <br /> <br />I have never seen another guy live off his past more then him!

B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I have been absolutely nuts about this guy forever.  He revs my motor as much now as he did 30 years ago.  At the ripe \\"old\\" age of 56, Robert Plant makes a mockery of all the \\"rock\\" stars today.  Nobody does it better than this man.<br /><br />His lush tones are richer, even more resonant, his delivery is meltingly elastic yet it is so powerful both on this CD and in concert like last week in Oakland where he nearly toasted the Amps and my ears with his powerful wail on \\"Gallows Pole\\" and other Zep songs with which he blew us all away.  An Incredible Concert!  His band Strange Sensation is awesome, especially the keyboard GURU whose amazing skill transfixes with musical treats and FX scattered here and there in the songs. The result is sonically dazzling.<br /><br /> Robert is dynamic, amazing, powerful, masterful and commanding on stage with his utterly scorching hip swivels.  Oh, yeah, he is as sensual as ever.<br /><br />\\"Brother Ray\\" is my fav. On this cut there is so much keyboard magic weaving around his passionate, magnificent performance on this song that it truly is as he said on Leno: \\"Future Rock\\".<br /><br />#11 \\"Mighty ReArranger\\" is exactly who Robert is. Every song is sculpted and perfected and the Mix is flawless. This is a superb CD.  To my ears, this is Robert's Masterpiece. His voice is youthful and magical as always. He is ageless. This one will reside permanently in my CD player.
B000000XCH|5.0|Tell me, are you tired of all the tormented, angst ridden rock bands with shaved heads and tattoos on every square inch of skin? <br />You know the ones- they can barely play the 3 chords they know and are working hard to learn two more. Or maybe you're sick of the country so-called singers in tank tops and cowboy hats big enough to hide their lobotomy scars. Perhaps you no longer want to hear about Clay Aikens or Christina Aga, Agu, oh who the hell knows? Or could it be you're fed up with the rappers who transform their earnings into gold teeth and Hummers? If you answered yes to any of the above, then perhaps you should check out Creedence Clearwater Revival. A great place to start is Cosmos Factory. Easily their best album. The playing is superb, the vocals are magnificent and the songs (including the ones not written by Fogerty) are first rate. Real rock n' roll. Real music by real, honest to God musicians. I promise, listening to this brand of rock n' roll will not make you want to slit your wrists, or kill your parents. Nor will it make you believe the world is in the toilet and you should sprinkle cyanide on your salad. Creedence did sing about world problems, people problems, war problems, and the like, but they never advocated moving to another planet or taking mind and soul killing drugs to escape it all. No, if you're looking for reasons to dress in black every day or urinate on a church, then look elsewhere. But, if you're tired of all the musical (and I use the word loosely) excrement available today, then buy this album first, and then move on to all the other great CCR albums. It'll make you want to live. <br />I promise.

B0000069NM|5.0|I can honestly say this is the best jazz record I've ever heard. That doesn't mean much because I don't generally listen to jazz, but I do listen to MM&W from time to time. <br />This album really does groove from start to finish, better than anything else I've heard. Well, I guess \\"Kubrick\\" kind of slows the album's momentum, but it's an interesting song nonetheless, and things pick up again with \\"Green Tea\\". Then again, \\"Deadzy\\" isn't the best way they could've ended this album. But seriously, everything else makes up for it completely and then some. <br />Scofield has this way of making any sound he wants come out of his guitar, and doing it easily too. Which makes me hate him. But respect the hell out of him at the same time. Guy's the man. <br />In closing, buy this album. Buy two actually. Pay it forward, you know.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|This is the best rap I've ever listened to(so far)! It has great and catchy lyrics, and the tunes rock(or rap)! Here's all of the songs, each one with how I rate it out of 10! OK, here we go now! <br /> <br />1. Git Up 7/10 A cool & deadly song. I really liked the explosion.  <br /> <br />2. Loyalty 8/10 Great beat, and instructive to you about love. <br /> <br />3. Just Like U 5/10 Not bad, but wish for more rappers than Biz.  <br /> <br />4. I'll Be Damned 9/10 A hilarious song, and a superb tune. <br /> <br />5. Dude 5/10 Pretty good, but still just a skit. <br /> <br />6. My Band 10/10 My favorite song on the entire album. It rules. <br /> <br />7. U R The One 6/10 A good song, but not as good as some others.  <br /> <br />8. 6 In The Morning 8/10 Funny and nasty put together. Nuff said. <br /> <br />9. How Come 9/10 A harsh song about losing a love you trusted.  <br /> <br />10. Leave Dat Boy Alone 7/10 A pretty cool song, and very solid. <br /> <br />11. Get My Gun 9/10 Cool, relentless, and bloodthirsty. In other words, it's everything you'd want in a hardcore D-12 rap song.  <br /> <br />12. Bizarre 6/10 Alright, but it's still a skit, despite it being somewhat cool. A 6 for it being on Bizarre, the best next to Em. <br /> <br />13. Bitch 10/10 My second favorite song on this album next to My Band. Cool tune, lots of lyric power, and even a ferocious woman. <br /> <br />14. Steve's Coffee House 6/10 The skit I like best. Don't ask. <br /> <br />15. D-12 World 9/10 It's mercilessly awesome-nuff said.  <br /> <br />16. 40 Oz. 10/10 Completely well made and perfect for young men. <br /> <br />17. Commercial Break 2/10 Must you really insult D-12 like this? <br /> <br />18. American Psycho II 7/10 So stellar. Not the best, but great. <br /> <br />19. Bugz 97 3/10 What a let down! Sad it's on such a good album. <br /> <br />20. Good Die Young 1/10 By far my least favorite D-12 song. Ugh.  <br /> <br />21. Keep Talking 9/10 The final song. It tells how there is nostopping Eminem and D-12 whatsoever. A good ending to a good CD. <br /> <br />Overall, this CD is the best rap I own at the moment. Anyone who likes hardcore music, rap, Eminem, or tough stuff should get it.
0143034901|5.0|A beautiful read that haunts the soul long after your adventure with this book is over.
0596007124|5.0|As someone responsible for teaching and implementing patterns, I've read and recommended several books covering the subject, but it is a daunting task to get through most of them. <br /> <br />This is a fun book. Just reading the bios of the author team is intriguing. An expert in Artificial Intelligence, one in learning theory and game design, a former Disney architect, and one in digital media. And all are developers. Cool.  <br /> <br />The design and overall layout is smart and hip. The table of contents has a summary view for quick finding. The detail view TOC has an overview paragraph for each chapter in addition to the headings and page numbers. Sweet! <br /> <br />The structure is as follows: A well-written introduction and overview of what and why of design patterns that provides a good foundation for the rest of the book. <br /> <br />Note: Woven throughout each chapter are exercises to assist you in LEARNING the material with suggested solutions at the end of the chapter. <br /> <br />Then it's off through a nice journey of several of the most used patterns: Observer, Decorator, Factory, Singleton, Command, Adapter and Facade, Template, Iterator and Composite, State, and Proxy.   <br /> <br />Next, the authors skillfully discuss Compound Patterns before wading through pattern classification and further resources. <br /> <br />My only gripe (and it's really not a huge deal) is that I wish the examples were in C# as well as java.  Don't let that scare you off from this really great book. <br /> <br />Overall, whether you are a novice or very experienced, I believe you can pick up something from this book.  Hope this helps! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002IU988|2.0|This is not the same old Creed but it's close enough to pass for a cover band. The new singer is not an improvement over Scott Stapp whose vocals while not the best were at least appropriate to the music and stood out in the same way Draiman of Disturbed does or Aaron Lewis of Staind, as well as others. This is a generic rock album laded with weak hooks and an ordinary lead singer sound we've all heard before. It's not a bad album but it's nothing special either and this is not an album that will get much if any, airplay.
B00005JNJT|4.0|Just when you thought you couldn't stand even one more movie based on a comic book superhero, along comes \\"Batman Begins\\" to redeem your faith in the genre.<br /><br />This film serves the same function for the previous \\"Batman\\" movies that the \\"Star Wars\\" prequels do for the original \\"Star Wars.\\"  In this film, we learn how it is that a shy, sensitive young lad named Bruce Wayne grows up to become a crime-fighting superhero known as Batman, replete with flying cape, mask and a heavily armored vehicle called the batmobile.  We learn what it is that causes him to dedicate his life to eradicating evil and righting wrongs in the fictional enclave of Gotham City.  I don't want to give away any of the major plot points, but suffice it to say that it involves a childhood tragedy, a desire for revenge, and the love of a morally pure young woman who sets him straight at a key moment in the story.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" succeeds primarily because it paints its central figure in realistic, believable terms.  It takes us step by step through the process by which Wayne transforms himself into Batman, not just in terms of the physical accoutrements that go into making up his superhero persona but the psychological development he must undergo before he can fully take on the superhero mantle.  Thus, \\"Batman Begins\\" works on the dual level of an action/adventure picture and a human drama.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" boasts fine art direction and special effects, exciting action sequences and first-rate performances by Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Morgan Freeman, and (a distressingly emaciated) Liam Neeson.<br /><br />This is the best \\"Batman\\" movie to hit the big screen yet.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This is one of the most gripping movies I have ever watched.  Christian Bale is incredable as 'Trevor', a sleep deprived skeleton of a man.  It is a true charachter study that is so deep you literally feel the pain and sadness of the protagonist oozeing out of the screen.  I won't give away the plot because this movie sort of...unfolds, to a dramatic climax that is better experianced then read. <br />Pay no attention to the people who gave this movie bad reviews, apparently they were looking for another Batman.  Although this movie did not have the box office weight as did the Dark Knight, I believe that it should be recognized as Mr. Bales greatest achievements.  From it's sadistically funny opening to it's huge twist of an ending this movie had me on the edge of my seat.  This DVD is a must have for any Christian Bale fan.  If you don't consider yourself to be that, you will after watching this movie.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I recently saw the show on PBS, and was simply blown away.  The cd is absolutely amazing, and unlike other groups such as the Three Tenors, Celtic Woman blends all the voices beautifully.  Their different renditions of both the Irish songs, and the modern songs were well done to say the least. The sound of Celtic Woman is where tradition meets the modern world in beautiful harmony.
B0006ZE7G2|3.0|Of course, Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" is a legendary album (3rd best selling of all time for all genres) and is one of my favorites ever. The movie is weird and doesn't make much sense, and is very psychadelic, like Floyd is. Worth a watch if you like The Wall.  P.S.- the Pink Floyd members aren't in this.
1400043662|5.0|The imagery isn't quite as rich as Wind up Bird Chronicle, however the amazinngly intricate plot, uniquely bizzare charcters, and that Murakami sense of the absurd, all are.  If you like Murkami, you'll love it, and if you don't like Murakami, you should.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I do NOT understand why people enjoy this band so much... maybe it's not my kind of music? Anyways, I really hate this band because they are way overrated, and their songs are pretty much all the same; I can not stand it. Do not buy this CD, you're better off saving your money.
1400043662|4.0|I guess from other reviews that I'm not the typical reader of this sort of book - some of the other reviews go way over my head, which might suggest that the book did, too. Unlike many readers, I'd never heard of this author, nor have I studied philosophy or metaphysics, nor did I appreciate any of the clever references to other works which I gather are in the book. So my review is based on the book alone without any external context or any expectations of this author at all. I picked the book up more or less at random from a public library shelf because it looked interesting. <br /> <br />The first half of the book had me sitting up reading in the early hours of the morning, it was that good. I'd never read anything quite like it and was fascinated to see where the story was going to go. I appreciated the book's readability too, with the author conveying complex ideas without getting bogged down in complex language. Some of the reviews I've read subsequently are less readable than the book itself, so don't be put off by thinking you need to be an intellectual to read it. <br /> <br />Unfortunately I felt that after the first half of the book, the sense of wonder began to fade and instead of being content to be caught up in the plot I was starting to wonder where it was going to go and how long it was going to take to get there. To be honest I hung in there for the last quarter mainly because I didn't want to abandon the book having come this far. It's not that the writing deteriorated or that the storyline wasn't still interesting, more that the characters weren't developing any further and it looked like they weren't going to. The plot just played itself out and I lost that \\"Wow, I can't wait to see what happens next\\" feeling. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, it's unlike anything else I've read and I did enjoy reading it. On the most basic level it's a fantasy which requires that you suspend your ideas about the nature of reality and, like one of the main characters, just accept what's going on without making judgements and perhaps without trying to understand at all. I can't say that it was an entirely satisfying read from cover to cover, but there were moments in which I was totally entranced. I will probably read more from this author, especially if I find that reality is getting a bit too heavy for me and I need a break. <br /> <br />By the way, cat lovers may need to be warned that there is one particularly unpleasant scene; I'm not entirely convinced that it was necessary and it is very disturbing.

0312330529|5.0|You know how it is with big books: however well they start out, somewhere around an inch in they start to drag. Half-way through, you're starting to doubt that you'll make it to the end, but feel obliged to press on. Three-quarters of the way through, you decide that too much of your time has been spent already and start looking around for something that hangs together better. Well, here's the exception. You'll be reading this one at every available moment and you'll not only still be there at the end but demanding the sequel too, even if it's twice as long.  <br /> <br />This book took a big chunk of time out of my life, as it seems to do for everyone who picks it up. It's an astonishing story made all the more compelling because it's true, however unlikely that seems to be. It's the ultimate adventure, the most memorable book I've read for years and the only book I can ever recall recommending to everyone I know, regardless of their usual reading interests. Make your friends go out and buy it. Make people who aren't your friends go out and buy it and make new friends. If you ever doubt your own capacity to survive and to rise above the seemingly random strokes of fate that life throws at you, Greg Roberts' experiences will remind you that the human spirit is stronger than you think. If Shantaram isn't on your bookshelf yet, what are you waiting for?
B00009V7RF|1.0|It is a sad day for this generation of young people when rooms packed full of 18 year old wannabes sing along carelessly to a song entitled \\"Let's Get Retarded\\".  THIS is truly pathetic.
078681859X|3.0|This book is about as different from Harry Potter as a story about a young wizard operating in a world dominated by magic can be.  It tracks the efforts of a wizard's apprentice to exact revenge on a powerful magician who humiliated him with the help of a wise-cracking, amoral djinni. <br /> <br />Others here have laid out the plot in detail so I'll just say that I really liked the book....I found it's take on the magical world refreshing and funny.  The djinni is hilarious and the book's level of detail is great.  I guess what prompts me to give it 3.5 stars is that the tone is rather cold: there is no reason to care about the characters and the only reason you cheer for the djinni and the boy is that the character they're after, Simon Lovelace, is more despicable than they are.  The world they operate in is cutthroat and amoral....as a result virtually none of the characters have truly redeeming features as even the so-called good guys are motivated by revenge: the boy against Lovelace and the djinni (mostly) against the boy.  For me to care about reading the rest of the books in this series I have to care about the characters.  As roughly written as the Harry Potter books sometimes are (the last few have felt as if they're two drafts from being finished), I care about Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Neville, and Luna in a way that I did not care about the characters in the Amulet of Samarkand.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|When I saw that Sony had made Michael Jackson the latest artist to be anthologized in their \\"The Essential...\\" series, I really was surprised to be honest, since the series never actually covers of this magnitude. I am compelled to say that they only compiled this collection because they wanted to cash in on the revived interest in his music after his \\"not guilty\\" verdict.<br /><br />If this is indeed, the case, then it shouldn't really matter, since the two disc \\"The Essential Michael Jackson\\" is actually an affordabel and, for the mosr part, comprehensive collection for a person who only wants to own one Michael Jackson cd. Now, I do not have this cd. I already own the four disc boxed set and \\"Thriller\\" (all a fan needs, really), but I already own must of the songs, so I feel that I am qualified to write a review for it.<br /><br />If you're the casual Jackson fan, you pretty much get all the stuff you need: the Jackson 5 hits (though \\"I'll Be There\\" and \\"Dancing Machine\\" are strangely omitted), early solo hits, later Jacksons recoridngs, and all the hits from his trifecta of best selling albums: \\"Off The Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Bad\\" and \\"Dangerous\\". The hits from those album make up well over half the collection. You will also get two post 1992 recordings, the 1995 megahit \\"You Are Not Alone\\" and the 2001 Top Ten single \\"You Rock My World\\".<br /><br />As with most if not all entries in the \\"Essential\\" series (as with most compilations), there are some problems. Judging by how many songs are on each discs, some tracks are bound to be edited. Most of these songs are the single versions that we're used to hearing, so we shouldn't really be bothered buy this, except that \\"Thriller\\" loses its magic without the long intro of the footsteps approaching the door, etc. Also, there are some tracks left off, such as \\"I'll Be There\\", \\"I Wanna Be Where You Are\\", \\"Dancing Machine\\", \\"Ease On Down The Road\\", the Paul McCartney \\"Say, Say, Say\\" (the only one of Michael's solo number ones to be omitted, though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael's), \\"State Of Shock\\" (The Jacksons' collaboration with Mick Jagger) and the Janet Jackson duet scream. However as a whole, this collection will not disappoint, and is highly recommended for casual fans.umber ones to be omitted, though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael's), \\"State Of Shock\\" (The Jacksons' collaboration with Mick Jagger) and the Janet Jackson duet scream.

B0009P42S2|5.0|In Steamboy, Director Otomo turns his attention to the Steampunk genre, and the result is a gripping Victorian era techno-thriller. The macguffin of the plot is a ball that is supposedly able to store steam at enormous pressure and density. It doesn't make much sense, but it manages to drive a plot with a lot of action, engaging steam-puffing war machines, and some moderately sophisticated debate about the uses of science and technology. <br /> <br />The characters are engaging, although hero Ray is  the usual somewhat generic plucky adolescent. The spoiled adolescent aristocrat Scarlett is considerably more interesting, as are Ray's father and grandfather, who personify conflicting ideas about the uses of technology. <br /> <br />The animation is, of course, wonderful, as expected from the director of Akira. The film is full of strikingly original action scenes, which are both well conceived and well executed. Destruction abounds. Reputedly, the film used quite a bit of computer graphics, but it is extraordinarily well integrated. The hand-drawn characters do not have the \\"pasted in\\" look that has characterized most previous attempts to combine hand drawn and computer generated art, and I was hard put to tell where the traditional animation ended and the computer animation began. <br /> <br />The DVD includes both the original Japanese version (with English subtitles available) as well as an English dubbed version. The English dubbing is extremely well done, with top notch talent including Anna Paquin (Rogue from the XMen movies) as the adolescent boy hero, Patrick Stewart as his grandfather, and Alfred Molina as his father. The English dubbing was overseen by Otomo himself, and is arguably better suited to the story than the original Japanese, as it is set in Victorian England. There are, however, a few moments where the words do not quite mesh with the mouth movements--which is a bit of a testament to the quality of the animation; in most animated films, you can't tell what language the characters are supposed to be speaking, anyway. <br /> <br />Although this is an animated film, it is not a kid's movie, and some parents will probably find some scenes inappropriate for small children. There is a lot of violence and destruction, at least as much as in a typical theatrical action thriller, but relatively little gore or overt killing--less than in Akira. There is, however, a moment when young Scarlett comes face-to-face with a dead soldier. It is an important and necessary scene, but might be troubling to some children.

B000054OXU|5.0|I have lotsof Neil's albums spanning his career, and this is one of my favorites.  Neil has consistently put out some, how shall we say...blah...albums from time to time (especially in the early 80s), but I would not lump this one in that category.  Landing rocks in an 80s Power Station kind of way.  Lots of rockers on this one with economical but effective guitar work.  Steve Jordan's drumming is great as well (Steve also rocked Keith Richard's solo albums).  As others have said, it's a fun album.  If you're looking for an \\"Everybody Knows...\\" or \\"After the Gold Rush\\" sound, I can only recommend you stick with those albums.  The negative reviews on this album are over the top.  Judge the album on its own merits as opposed to how you wish it sounded.
B0000029GA|5.0|i just came on here to cuss out that person who gave this 3 stars. you have to be a retard to think this is average or the beats are crappy. everyone knows this is the perfect rap album and in most rap fans top ten cds. so a big F**K YOU to anyone who disses this album cos u a sucka. nelly probably wat u think is good so dont be an idiot get some taste

B0007GAEGC|5.0|I love the celtic traditional tunes offered on this CD and the modern tunes fit in well enough for lovely listening.  The ethereal voices and arrangements make even the over-used Danny Boy sound fresh.  At times you can imagine yourself floating on a cloud with angels singing around you.<br /><br />It's hard to pick a favorite track with so many quality performances, but the beautiful fiddle work on The Butterfly made that instrumental work stand out.  I also love the voice on the traditional tune, She Moved Through The Fair.  It is pure magic.
0385338686|5.0|I have loved everyone of the books in Kinsella's `SHOPAHOLIC' series and I equally enjoyed her first stand alone novel ` CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET' now Kinsella brings us her second stand alone and sixth novel to date and I absolutely adored this one as much as I did the others.  I pre-ordered the `UNDOMESTIC GODDESS', something that I rarely do (okay so I only pre-ordered it two days before it was released but that is beside the point), because I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy.  I tore into it as soon as it arrived and didn't want to put it down!  Sophie Kinsella writes with an ease that is difficult to match and a wit that literally keeps you laughing out loud.<br /><br />The plot to this novel is one that particularly intrigued me; a high powered and highly stressed lawyer for one of the top law firms in London makes a huge mistake that costs her company millions.  Now that she has discovered the blunder rather than stick around to face the music she flees to the English countryside where, under false pretenses, she gets a job as a housekeeper.  As someone who's never cooked a meal in her life nor cleaned a toilet let alone an entire house she enlists the help of the sexy grounds keeper and his mother to turn her from an Undomestic Goddess to a domestic treasure that this family cannot live without.<br /><br />The `UNDOMESTIC GODDESS' had me laughing harder than I have laughed since...well, since I read Kinsella's last book.  I highly recommended this book to anyone who is a fan of Kinsella's work and if you have never read anything by her the `UNDOMESTIC GODDESS' is as good a place to start as any.
0875428940|4.0|I'm fairly new to Tarot, and this is only my second deck. That's why I only rated it 4 stars. But it has beautiful imagery, and is very easy to interpret. The people look real, which is not true of many of the decks that I researched. I also like that the Devil card is more signified with a temptation sequence, which is a more accurate keyword for this card. And I love the Magician card, which reminds me of a character from Charles de Lint's stories, (another personal favorite). <br />  On the whole, it's a great deck, geared towards Pagans rather than Christians. There is some nudity, but lovely pictures and imagery.
B000003TA9|5.0|This is Sonic Youth at the height of their powers.  Dirty is their most rocking, and extroverted album.  At the time this came it seemed the Youth could do no wrong;  from Evol, to Sister, to the masterpiece Daydream Nation, to their major label debut Goo, every album was either better than or at least as good as the one that preceded it.  With Dirty they hit their peak. They mixed the sonic experimentation of EVOL with the strong songs of Daydream Nation and the energy and melodicism of Goo. But Dirty has a huge emotional resonance all its own that raises it above the others: the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts.<br /><br />The ass kicking punk of 100% starts the album with a bang. And it just gets better. Theresa's Sound World is perhaps my favorite Sonic Youth song (along with Shadow Of A Doubt) Drunken Butterfly, the intense Kim song Shoot, Sugar Cane, damn. Dirty has so many strong songs its just amazing, ridiculous cover of Nic Fit by DC homeys The Untouchables notwithstanding. It does stay completely true to the lo fi spirit of the original DC hardcore sound, but seems more an in-joke than an actual song. There's a muscular intensity and complexity to Dirty that Sonic Youth rarely matched and never surpased on any other release. On this album Sonic Youth really decided to be ROCK band. Yet Dirty is still melodic and at times beautiful and transcendent.<br /><br />Partly to blame for Dirty's success is the incredibly good recording and mix thanks to Butch Vig of Garbage, Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana fame who also did Goo.  He got a clear and very powerful sound for this album that greatly benefits the songs. I would say if you're a newbie to Sonic Youth this would be an excellent place to start.  Also recommended are EVOL, Daydream Nation, Goo, A Thousand Leaves and Sonic Nurse. Have at it.
B000002IGV|5.0|You can't go wrong with this one!  This is classic rock, classic metal, classic Twisted Sister.  There's not a weak track on the album.  Not only do you get \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\", but also \\"Stay Hungry\\", \\"Burn In Hell\\", and 5 other classic tracks. <br /> <br />Speaking of \\"Burn In Hell\\", I remember reading a Christian publication at the time that singled this song out (along with many other rock songs, past and present), and basically criticized it and said that it was evil.  They quoted the first few verses of the song (\\"Welcome to the abandoned land\\", etc) and made all sorts of judgments about it.  But apparently, they must've stopped listening to the song after the first few verses because THE REST OF THE SONG IS ABOUT CHANGING YOUR WAYS AND NOT BEING EVIL.  This song says what a lot of these self-righteous types were trying to say, and maybe if they had taken a moment from judging others and decided to LISTEN, they would've heard that.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Ok, picture a kinda styrofoam box...but without walls...just like a crazy styrofoam outline. Now picture Mr. Reznor...about 8.5/10ths of the way into this box...with his left side still a little out of it. That's what this cd sounds like. It's good...but i have faith that, with time, a strategic shift, and some wiggling, he'll fit quite nicely. Yes, i'm still talking about music. I have faith that it will sound more comfortable again soon.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|Yes, this movie has a strange plot, lots of bad humor, sub-par special effects, and an ending which falls flat, but rather than taking this film to task on what many other people have already pointed out, I'm going to present a small list of the things this film actually does right.  And even though I share the opinion of this film with the consensus, I do have to give this film credit on a few marks: <br /> <br />1. Each of the 7 main characters has their moment to shine - Some of Shatner's co-stars have been pretty hard on him over the years for being a camera hog, but in this script co-penned by the Captain himself, each of the principals has their moment in the spotlight.  Chekov has temporary command of ths ship, Uhura has her moonlight dance, Sulu takes part in the Paradise City raid and pilots the shuttle, and Scotty gets a relationship with Uhura and breaks Kirk, Spock, and McCoy out of the brig.  As for Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, we're with them throughout most of the film. <br /> <br />2. Music by Jerry Goldsmith - 'Nuff said. <br /> <br />3. Pacing - The film moves along at a good pace and doesn't stay at one place or on one scene too long. <br /> <br />4. The opening scene - It may not be a popular opinion, but I love the opening scene with Sybok in the desert. <br /> <br />5. The Sybok character - I don't like Sybok's quest, but I like the character, and the actor who plays him (Lawrence Luckinbill).  Though I found it odd that he got a haircut before they went out to meet \\"God\\". <br /> <br />On a side note, not long after Star Trek IV came out, Starlog magazine printed a small comic which showed two people looking at a movie poster for a fictonalized Star Trek V which showed Spock wearing a fake nose and glasses, and having a pie hurled at him.  The poster read \\"A laugh riot because you demanded it.\\"  One of the people looking at the poster said to the other \\"I'm starting to wish Trek 4 wasn't so successful\\" (referring to the humor in Star Trek IV).  Ironically, considering the attempts at humor made in this film, it seems that this carton was, at least partially, prophetic.
B00005JNNZ|4.0|This movie was very interesting Coach Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) demonstrated what it is like or can be like trying to save teens from getting involved in street life.  The alternative was to utilize their time in a more positive and constructive way, such as attending college. The younger actor's who portrayed the school basketball team were very talented, as well. Of course it had drama, light violence, all the ingredients that seem to sale movies these days.  It was well worth watching.  I did not feel that I waisted my time watching it.
B00001SIES|5.0|Muse's debut \\"Showbiz\\" despite being an immensely beautiful album is still pretty much anchored in the coordinates of their two main influences-Radiohead and Jeff Buckley(\\"Unintended\\"is the best ballad Jeff Buckley never wrote)which doesn't mean it's not filled with great songs,only that Muse hadn't by then found their own voice.<br /><br />In their search for na original sound they bulit this endlessly charming melodic rock album that boasts some of the cusp of the century's best tunes-\\"Muscle Museum\\",\\"Sunburn\\",\\"Unintended\\",\\"Escape\\"and\\"Hate this and I'll love you\\" among the top picks.

0553573403|5.0|I have always been a reader of fantasy and its likes.  When I started out as a kid there was a whole lot of Dragonlance, Brooks, Eddings, etc. on my shelf... That was until I came across Robert Jordan's 'Wheel of Time'.<br /><br />Huh?  Why is he writing about TWoT in his 'A Game of Thrones' review?  Well when I started reading the TWoT, it was like the first time openeing a book.  The depth in Jordan's portrayal of his world and the characters who inhabit it was unlike anything I had read before.  I was completely consumed by the series with the vast majority of my previous reading material unable to hold my attention for the lack of originality and breadth.<br /><br />Until I hit about book 7 or 8...<br /><br />If you read fantasy (or are reading this review) then you probably know Robert Jordan's mega-epic, 'The Wheel of Time', which in turn means that you probably already know that many of Jordan's fans hit 'the wall' when they get to this point in his series.  Therefore, I will skip the details (Hint for Jordan).<br /><br />Getting to the the point (and to the actual review of 'A Game of Thrones'), I then begain my seemingly vain search for writer who could captivate my attention the way Jordan had in his books 1 - 6, not just hold me captive.  Nothing else seemed worth the time to read.  I tried Goodkind (blatant rip-off of TWoT I swear, and not written nearly as well), 'Harry Potter' (OK, I know that the books were written for kids, but even Rowling's expansive imagination couldn't keep me on them) among a few others.  And then I stumbled upon George RR Martin's work.<br /><br />Sure he writes fantasy, but he really writes about people.  Multi-dimensional, flawed, REAL people.  I believe I saw it written in a previous review somewhere that you could take his story and characters, put them in any setting and it would still be amazing.  I think that couldn't be more true.<br /><br />Martin's characters do not follow one flat, static stereotype of  Hero, Villan, Band of merry followers, ancient white haired wizard and so-forth - they develop.  Their decisions have real consequences and if they screw up, which real people do, they may well end up a King or dead for it.<br /><br />At times grim, ugly and vicious, Martin's world is not a kind one, but neither were the times.  What it is though, is an interesting one with intersting people doing interesting things, which is far more then I can say for the majority of the generic rag-mag fantasy out there.<br /><br />George Martin has breathed new life into a crippled genre, much like Jordan did I found as well.  The difference however, being that Martin acheives this and still manages to move the story along in each chapter.<br /><br />In closing, this is as 'real' as fantasy gets, and I could easily say the best that fantasy gets.  If you read fantasy, or even just like good writing and a good story, you ought to drop the Potter book and pick this one up.<br /><br />** Do be careful which reviews you read... there are lots of spoilers out there.f  Hero, Villan, Band of merry followers, ancient white haired wizard and so-forth - they develop.

B0002V7O3S|5.0|One of the best UFO movies ever done to this point. This film has scenes of true terror. The charactor of Travis is played near flawlessly by D.B. Sweeney. His alien abduction is unlike any other thats been put on film. Robert Patricks' role  as the concerned friend is a remarkably expressed down to Earth portrayal. James Garner plays an outstanding ultra suspicious investigator. The rural setting adds an understandable skepticism about the bizzare UFO story. The aliens look fakeish, but that doesn't take away from their cold, heartless actions and the otherworldly image they give off. With the same content this movie could easily have been a back shelf bomb. However, careful analysis of thoughts and ideas prevailed. It is based on a supposedly true story and handles it well. The movie also deals with friendship, and the layers it has. The film is different because it deals with two seperate issues:Whats happening on Earth/Whats happening with the abducted. Good Sci-Fi all around. The dvd quality is very good. Turn it up.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Terrible supernatural thriller that has Keanu Reeves of all people playing a occult detective trying to figure out a supernatural conspiracy against the world of men. The movie lacks for starters a script that makes some kind of sense and it's riddled with such bad dialog that you can't even believe your ears at certain parts of the film. The other problem is Keanu Reeves, who is just the wrong guy to play a role like this. He comes across more like he's constipated than a brooding P.I. who dabbles with the occult. The movie falls on his shoulders and it falls off the map of credibility because of it. Other than Keanu's attempt at drama, the acting is decent for what it is and that because of the efforts of a few actors who are trying to keep a strait face while speaking the bad dialog from the script. First and foremost is the performance of Rachel Weisz, which give this film more class and substance than the script dares to give it. To say that her performance is much better than the film itself is an understatement because it's much more than the film even inspires to be. She's so good in fact that you actually do feel sorry for her for even being in it in the first place. The second great performance belongs to Djmon Hounsou, who does wonders with his role, even though it more of an bit role than a central one. He deserved more respect than this but unfortunately he does not get it in this film. Tilda Swinton also does well with her part but unfortunately for her, her role literally give this movie the biggest plot hole of all. A plot hole big enough for it to kill the last act of the film.  <br /> <br />Maybe under a better director who know what he was doing and better script that had a story to tell, this could have been a better movie, unfortunately after this debacle, we will never know.  <br />
B0009W5JS2|1.0|Wow, was this an action movie or a comedy? This was so bad I laughed through most of it!
B00003CXAA|5.0|1972 was the year of a motion picture event that is considered the greatest film of all time, in my opionon it's is one of the greatest landmark films that spawned two timeless sequels. The Godfather legacy, the masterpiece three movie story of a crime family's rise to power with Mafia Justice. The greatest gangster films of all time. Great touching and heartbreaking story of a man who would \\"burn in hell\\" to protect his family. A movie that shows; as a gangster, as a corleone, as the son of Don Vito Corleone, your family is worth dying for. A 80 year story of a man and his three sons extrodronary life of crime. <br />anyone who hasn't see these films, see these legendary films now. Starring the legendary Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Also starring Diane Keaton, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and Andy Garcia and directed by Francis Ford Coppolla. rent these oscar winning masterpieces, \\"leave the gun, take the canolli and rent the godfather DVD collection\\"
B000063147|5.0|First of all, A7X is the best thing to come out in hardcore metal. Not only do they use unbelieveable guitar shredding, amazing drum tempo's, and the widest range of vocals (not to mention the touch of modern age piano), but they have made a breakaway from all of the \\"other\\" music that is out there. You name to me one other band that uses all of this to make incredible new metalcore music, and I will withdrawl this statment, otherwise, keep on listening to your mindless, talentless, soon to be burnout bands on the daily top 40 like all the other tools out there and don't waste your time here anymore. Not to mention that these guys are heavily influenced by most bands I bet you grew up too. (If you even listened to anything half way decent growing up.)
0743454537|5.0|This book was absolutely captivating!  I read it in two days and would recommend it to anyone!  Despite what some people seem to think, the ending is perfect.  Surprising, yes, but thankfully not cliche.  Instead the book ends on a note which reminds its readers that anything can happen.  Picoult is an amazing writer who never disappoints.
B00005JNJT|5.0|After the Batman franchise started to become as fermented and corrupt as Gotham itself, devolving into silliness and big men in small tights (think Arnold Schwarzenneger's Mr. Freeze), and with comic book movies in general becoming ever more formulaic and predictable in the quest of the almighty mass market buck, it was refreshing to see Hollywood and Warner Bros. wipe away the old franchise and start anew, handing it to an auteur director, Christopher Nolan; an intense mid-level star known more for his serious work (the excellent Christian Bale) than for his comedy (Keaton) or his looks (Clooney, Kilmer); and to give them a budget, script and the acting muscle (Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Tom Wilkinson) to pull it off. <br />This is a quieter, more thoughtful, darker Batman, but not a kindler, gentler one. By seeing more of the back story, there are layers in complexity to the brooding and the cartoon becomes less, well, cartoonish and feels far more real. I want to particularly laud the script, which involves an intricate and deep plot that weaves delightful circles and surprises that I won't give away here. Unlike in 'Spiderman' -- which at the time was probably the best of the genre despite its formula-driven story -- this is thankfully no 'coming of age' tale of another awkward teenboy, this is about the chiseling of a young man full of anger and guilt into a benevolent creature of the night. Which is far more believable and definitely more satisfying. <br />*** <br />Other notes. Sadly, despite all of the praise I heap upon the movie, I still didn't get as lost in it as I would have when I was younger. This is not the movie's fault. I mourn for my lost youth, that magical time when you could instantly believe everything that you saw on the screen and not get caught up in analyzing how the movie makers made it happen. I guess that's a sign I'm leaving the 18-34 demographic and entering the 35-49? <br />And I also wanted to say a kind word aboutKatie Holmes. She may be a nutcase for marrying Tom Cruise, but I thought she came off well here, and provided a necessary feminine heart and counterpoint to the darkness of the movie (not that there's much romance to speak of). She comes across as sweet, sharp and brave -- exactly the kind of woman that Batman would want to protect. <br />Enjoy! <br /> <br />
B00005IC2H|2.0|I read the reviews and with much anticipation decided to see what all the fuss was about. <br /> <br />Well musically it is pleasent the only thing I do not get is the \\"made up\\" language I cannot understand at which point an artist decides they will make up a language. <br /> <br />To the reviewer who mentioned the word pretencious been used in the bad reviews, it is because it is. <br /> <br />I would liken it to dubbing telly tubies over some old Amon Tobin instrumentals. It's a good job I downloaded it as I would not have liked to waste my money on it.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I'll admit, I am a little obsessed with the X-men movies, but it's 'cause they're so GOOD! This was by far the best superhero sequel ever (I say \\"superhero\\" for want of a better word-there aren't many mutant sequels out there). <br /> <br />And I gotta tell you, PAY NO ATTENTION TO THOSE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! The people who write them have way too much time on their hands if they can call Cyclops gay or say Rogue is a snivelling whiner. Get a life! <br /> <br />X-men, the original, was great too, you should see that. And Wolverine is so HOT! I LOVE HIM! It had all the right stuff, and moved beautifully into this sequel. But `X2' is the one I could watch over and over again. Really! <br /> <br />By the way, did anyone notice when Mystique was morphing her way into Stryker's office and someone commented, \\"She's good,\\" to which Magneto responded, \\"You have no idea,\\" with a smirk on his face? Did you see that? 'Cause if you ask me, there is definitely something sexual between them...even if Magneto's probably 30 years older than Mystique. E[...] <br /> <br />Anyway, another great part of `X2' is the romance between Bobby and Rogue. It's so sad that they can't even touch each other, but maybe they'll find a way in the next movie-which I'm REALLY hoping is good, although I heard Bryan Singer isn't returning as director. <br /> <br />Also, in `X2,' the character Nightcrawler was awesome, although I don't really understand his name. I love that he's German, I don't know why-but it seems to fit. Now, he's Mystique's son right-I mean they're both blue. Must find out... <br /> <br />Lastly, the soundtrack was amazing! One of the last scenes, where the plane is taking off at last as Jean Grey gives her life to save everyone and Nightcrawler starts praying \\"The Lord is my shepherd...\\", while this suspenseful, though mostly saddening music, builds, is just perfect. It's one of my favorite scenes in the movie. <br /> <br />So if you want a really great superhero...ahem, mutant movie,watch this one! I would give it infinite stars if I could! <br /> <br />Rating: PG-13 for action violence and some sexuality. <br />
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City is probably the single best movie I have seen in the last ten years.  Now, I have been following both Rodriguez and Tarantino since they did Four Rooms back in 1995, and have done cultural analysis studies on both Reservior Dogs and Pulp Fiction (two of my favorite movies of all time) and I still think that Sin City trumps them all.  Let me put it another way.  Even if you end up totally confused by the story line and getting sick to your stomache at the violence, the cimematography alone is worth the purchase.  I was totally blown away by what they we able to accomplish; the spots of color, the complete contrast fades, the action shots are all utterly amazing.
0143034901|5.0|I raced through this book without giving any thought to it being a translation.  Wonderful writing with a great cast of characters, particularly Fermin Romero de torres, bibliographic adviser to the Sempere bookshop!  I liked his turn of the phrase and expressions so much I felt like picking up a highlighter to capture them.  If you enjoy novels and historical fiction I think you will be in for a treat.
B000005RT8|4.0|Sir Paul's post-Beatle career has been frustratingly uneven, yet the hidden gems still emerge. Macca finally clips his Wings and returns to the do-it-yourself approach that served him well on his first solo recording. Released in 1980, &#34;McCartney II&#34; is a more polished production than the 1970 effort - highlighted by the hit single &#34;Coming Up,&#34; a memorable rocker titled &#34;Nobody Knows,&#34; the ballad &#34;One of These Days&#34; and a surprising amount of experimentation. There are relatively few misfires (such as the irritating &#34;Temporary Secretary&#34;) while the instrumentals hold up quite well. &#34;Check My Machine&#34; and &#34;Secret Friend&#34; — the B-side bonus tracks — display an atmospheric, improvisational quality rarely heard in McCartney's work. The overall album surpasses the mediocrity that plagued McCartney during the 1980s.
0064409422|5.0|In some ways, it is a relatively simple story, but so full of magic.  Four children find a wardrobe that leads to the magic world of Narnia, where it is always winter but never Christmas.  The White Witch holds sway over the land but Aslan is growing near.  With this delightful premise, a series was spawned (although, of course, chronologically the later written Magician's Nephew comes first).  C.S. Lewis, in the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, was less concerned with explanations than in the other books and more interested in tale-telling, and this he does marvelously, making this one of the very best of the entire series.  This book has rightly become a classic and re-reading it years later, one forgets how much magic is wrapped up in this fast-moving, narratively simple story.  Always a delight.
0385486804|5.0|This is a terrifying book.  So much is gained in knowing that even 100 years ago, people were pressed and stressed to find some peaceful sanctuary off the relentless path to progress, the traffic, the crowds, the darkly looming industrial growth.   <br /> <br />I first picked it up while visiting my younger brother and I could not put it down!  It was terrifying because this younger brother emphatically expresses similar sentiments.  Shortly after the visit, I started to get a hankering for some camping myself and joined two friends for the Summer Solstice and Full June Moon.  The peace of eternity fell softly upon us, but that is like Death, is it not? <br /> <br />Anyway, to the book a 5 Star recommended read to gain some perspective on our headlong rush to the future as bright as it may be.
B00097A5HW|5.0|It's been seven years since her last All Spanish language record (remember the last one was Dnde Estan Los Ladrones? 1998), and I can finally said she has come full circle. Her days of \\"Pies Descalzos\\" were filled with hits and novelty, and a popularity I'm sure she did not see coming. Then her follow up \\"... ladrones\\" reaffirmed her as a singer/composer that had more to offer than just a string of hits- she proved that her music was seriously addictive. Later came the MTV Unplugged album, a remixed EP, but we were all waiting for more. After the explosion of the single \\"Ojos Asi\\" she was meant to be marketed to a wider audience, and hence the mass anticipation for her first English language album \\"Laundry Service\\". To many it was a Latin Explosion, to others she had abandoned her own roots. Whichever way it went, her cross-over was a true success, period. Now, I can honestly say that I am more than satisfied with \\"Fijacion Oral Vol. 1\\" The songs rival those of her early efforts in terms of natural hooks and sincere lyrics. The leading single \\"La Tortura\\" (thank you to Alejandro)was embraced by all (no distinctions here in terms of background- something rare, if ever seen). It is a hit, and will go in history as a song that transcends language barriers. But songs like \\"En tus Pupilas\\" make you feel happy to listen to the intelligent prose of her lyrics. \\"La Pared\\", is a gem on its own- talk about a future number 1. \\"Obtener un si\\" a flash back with simple pop arrangements, it sounds like a piece for the soundtrack of a musical. \\"Dia Especial\\" is a simple honest mid-tempo rock based track. Just lay back en enjoy (For this one- thanks to Cerati). \\"Escondite Ingles\\" pure pop fun, almost like playing vocally, but with convincing results. \\"No\\" has got to be the strongest track, lyrically. A bomb in terms of what it can make you feel if you pay attention- we all have been hurt, but how does it measure to what she is saying? \\"Las de la intuicion\\" - a subtle dance track,great arrangements. \\"Dia de Enero\\" another laid back track- she says \\"tu mas que nadie mereces ser feliz\\" and makes you feel light and cool. Finally, \\"Lo Imprescindible\\" is a collage of guitars, drums and electro hooks. An experiment in terms of music and lyrics.  <br /> <br />At times when artist fill CDs with 14, 15, 16 or more tracks; Shakira offers you 10 solid all Spanish tracks. Give it a try and sing with the rest of us \\"Y ahora todo lo importante es que vuelvas a mi, vuelvas a mi, vuelve...\\" Y si que volvio!
159413023X|5.0|I don't even know where to begin with this book. A friend of mine had been telling me about forever, so I borrowed it from her. Wow! I have never felt so connected to characters in a book. The author makes you feel like you have known these people your whole life. I can't even put into words the emotions you go through reading this book. I reccomend it to everyone now. It was a fast read which was the one thing that disappointed me the most. I actually bought my own copy of this book because its one I will read over and over again.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King earned everything she's got in music quickly. Like Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller,\\" it is, in itself, a \\"best-of\\" CD, with most of the 12 originals becoming classics.<br /><br />What makes Carole King and \\"Tapestry\\" different:<br /><br />This is no \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" (Beatles) or \\"Pet Sounds\\" (Beach Boys). The recordings aren't complexly layered with more tracks than we have fingers. Bob Dylan's poetic lyrics don't float from the speakers. Jimi Hendrix guitar stylings do not smoke through. These are just great, simple songs that come out originally, and have survived the test of time. As classics go, King's work is on anyone's list.<br /><br />Carole King is as straight forward as Janis Joplin, without Janis' brusky, unfiltered cigarette tone. King's voice is as smooth as Joni Mitchell's or Carley Simon's, with more sentimentality.<br /><br />The songs are about the loss of love, or the worry that love may not continue, or the exultation of love. They are all a little sad, and forebode that today's love might be tomorrow's heartbreak.<br /><br />Either way, buy the CD, listen to these late at night as you read CD reviews, and remember, \\"You've Got a Friend.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com
B0007GAERG|3.0|This CD is definitely a step up from the abysmal Charmbracelet, and Glitter misfires.  The CD has a triple threat with the first 3 singles, and it continues throughout the record.  The problem doesn't lie in the album.  Well, not really. The album is a definite winner.  It's the listeners and the buyers of the albums.  The buyers of the albums fail to realize that Mariah Carey has truly lost her voice.  From the failed attempt to reach her long gone 5th octave, or the protooled stretches of failed attempts to hold on to a note.  The fact that none of these songs are complete without a warble or two on the track.  This album would be a great debut for a young ingenue, sure, but for a 35 year old 15 year veteran it shouldn't be this way.  From her \\"exhaustion\\" to her eccentricities (who in their RIGHT mind has an obsession with Mean Girls at the brink of middle age?) she has failed to live up to what she presented us in the 90's, and you know her fans will have to admit that sooner or later.  Even the cover of the record is a bit contrived. Mariah in her orangish glow, looking creepily like Beyonce, seems burned out and tired.  Her voice in performances are awful...did any black family miss the horrid BET Awards, that were an embarrassment to black people everywhere, where Mariah sang half way with a pre recorded, mastered, mixed, and pro-tooled tape. She cracks, is continuously out of breath and then has the nerve to flip her weave and thank the audience and God for her achievement, as if she's just done a fantastic job.  Not so much. The Ellen Show didn't help matters, with her cracking off key interpretation once again of We Belong Together, the audience is happy, but quite noticeably confused.  The album is good mind you. However, This album gives you a bad picture of her.  It shows the false pretense of music.  And Mariah feels the need to hide that she is a drinker, a big time smoker and has all around lost her touch.  Get the CD but skip the performances, skipthe concerts, and quit praising this as the return of the voice, now this is the debut of the Just Aiight Mariah.  Hope this opens peoples eyes, I don't mean to hate, but it has to be said, it gets old to hear about how great someone is when they simply are not.
0393317552|5.0|First a disclaimer;  I have not finished the book yet.  The five stars are based on what I've read so far.  Perhaps I will post again when I have finished.   <br />I just thought it would be fun to take a break and get up on Amazon to read a few reviews.   <br /> <br />I can't help but notice the recurring theme in the critiques here, that Diamond believes that geography is the sole determining factor in why Eurasian people came to dominate, and that other factors (such as cultural, racial, biological...) played no role whatsoever.  In fact, this is not what Diamond believes, and he has made this abundantly clear.   <br /> <br />For example, he fully acknowledges that the tradition of Confucianism was a factor in \\"stifling scientific inquiry in China\\", he just doesn't see this as an \\"ultimate explanation\\", to use his words.  Similiarly, he posits that guns, germs, and steel all do indeed play a role in the way things went down.  This is how he named the book afterall !  But for Diamond, these questions become,  'why did Confucianism arise in China', ... and  'why were Euroasians the ones to get guns, germs, and steel first ?'... He encourages us to keep asking  'why' until we arrive at the ultimate answers, or a \\"broad pattern\\", which according to Diamond just happen to be geographic in nature.   <br /> <br />This, in my view, is the brilliance of Diamond's book.  If you ask 'why' enough times, won't you inevitably arrive at geographic considerations ?  Can you go farther than that ?   I mean, you can ask, I suppose, 'why were they there', but it seems the answers to such questions will also be geographic in nature.  <br />
B0000B3FCX|5.0|Nickelback's 2003 The Long Road rocks.  I liked Silver Side Up  (2001), but LR rocks, rocks, rocks.  Big guitar sound, ballsy vocals, big bass, rocking drums...all of it.  Based on their radio hits, one would not guess how much this album rocks.  I only wish that there were more guitar solos.  That's the 80s metal in me I guess.  I also appreciate Kroeger's relational lyrics, uncommon for harder music stereotypically.
B000784WMW|3.0|This version was pretty good.  It seemed like a soap opera set.  I wasn't impressed  with the set at all.  I felt like  I was watching a play.  I did like  how the script was very close to the book.  Timothy Dalton was a wonderful Rochester.  He got it right.  Zelah clarke was good, I thought a little old to play the part.  All in all it is good,  just a little dated with the set and the filming.
B00005Q66T|3.0|This disc is hampered by poor sequencing and some serious ommissions from her hit parade spanning the period covered.  Also, the versions/mixes chosen to appear on this disc are not necessarily the popular versions.  <br />The over-santized version of \\"Human Nature\\" without the \\"I'm not your b---- don't hang your s--- on me\\" line feels anticlimactic, as does the horribly sliced up \\"edit\\" version of the wondrous \\"Ray Of Light\\"--an edit I personally never heard on the radio.  (It was either faded early or played in full, but I digress.)  An opportunity to officially release on CD the rare yet radio-and-fan-preffered Morales Radio Mix of \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" is missed in favour of the less appealing Album Edit.  <br />And if you're going to put the never-played-on-radio orchestral album mix (and not the ALWAYS radio-played Miami Mix Edit) of \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" on this, then put that song closer to the orchestral pop gem \\"Frozen\\" and DON'T follow \\"Frozen\\" with the shiny R&B/Asian bells of \\"Take A Bow\\"!  <br />Better yet, they should have just tried for a rough choronological tracklist that illustrated an always evolving artistic journey.  The ommission of the plodding \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" is forgivable, but the fact that \\"I'll Remember\\" (among her all-time biggest hits ever) and \\"You'll See\\" were already featured on the ballad compilation Something To Remember is no justification for not including them here.<br />It's not a total disaster--although not hits, adventurous songs like \\"Bedtime Story\\" do merit inclusion as they indicate Madonna's willingness to experiment with her music.  But overall, what should have been a documentation of the most artistically rewarding decade (so far) of Madonna's career instead plays like a lazily assembled mix burned off the internet.
B00004VVNB|1.0|. . . because, before Star Wars, we had to watch befuddled backsewage like this!<br /><br />Just about the time you think the story is starting to make sense, the rug is pulled out from under you and the plot goes ga-ga.  In thirty-odd years, I have never been able to decipher why the dome city self-destructs in the end, or, for that matter, why Farah Fawcett (age 29 and a TV superstar) was given a bit part while Jenny Agutter (age 34 and a bit chubby)was given the co-starring role.  But I suspect that whatever was behind that directorial decision also explains why there obviously was no budget for a script.
B000002H97|5.0|This is the only full Metallica album I have, but it is enough to put Metallica on my favorite artists list. The 1 hours, 2 minutes and 31 seconds from the beginning of Enter Sandman, one my favorite Metallica songs, to the end of The Struggle Within, should keep any hard rock or metal fan happy. It is not one of those albums full of filler songs, but stays strong all the way through.
B000000W6R|5.0|Smashing Pumpkins - Pisces Iscariot (1994)<br /><br />This collection of non-album tracks is quite diverse as it explores both the most quiet and the hardest-rocking extremes this band was capable of. Too bad it skipped some fantastic non-album material like \\"Glynis,\\" but record companies tend to keep some gems in the \\"harder-to-find\\" category so fanatic collectors can feel special (and mastermind/uber-ego Billy Corgan obviously had something to do with it). I'm a fan, but since I don't have any particular inside info about the band to impart (except that I just read today that Billy is trying to get the band together again), I'll just relay my impressions of PISCES ISCARIOT --------><br /><br />\\"Soothe\\" - a gorgeous performance on vocal and acoustic guitar by head Pumpkin Billy Corgan recorded at home. *****<br /><br />\\"Frail and Bedazzled\\" - supercharged balls-to-the-wall rockin' out. *****<br /><br />\\"Plume\\" -one of my very favorite SP tunes, this one really captures a certain \\"don't give a f@#%\\" feeling that I myself am prone to fairly often. Corgan's piercing guitar really soars on this one when he solos and he makes excellent, trippy use of some kind of foot peddle or thingamajig (a tech wizard I am not). *****+<br /><br />\\"Whir\\" - an easy-going tune, nice and melodic, although I'm not crazy about the way it ends (with a rather ineffective guitar riff that sounds a little too melodramatic for my tastes). ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Blew Away\\" - another mellow cut with James Iha on vocals. Apparently Corgan left Iha to his own devices on this one and it turned out really nice. ****<br /><br />\\"Pissant\\" - The thrashiest track on PISCES, and a real shot of adrenaline. Frantic drumming from Jimmy Chamberlin.  ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Hello Kitty Kat\\" - steady, super-heavy rocker. Great chord changes at the chorus. *****<br /><br />\\"Obscured\\" - a pretty, meandering little journey via acoustic guitar strum, simple percussion and ringing electric guitar touches. Wondrous vocal from Corgan. But he almost kills the mood with that distracting drone at the end of the song. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Landslide\\" - Stevie Nicks cover, gorgeous and very effective. Corgan delivers a heart-felt vocal that stands on its own, a worthy interpretation with a different feel from Stevie Nicks (who admittedly has a better voice). Great acoustic guitar, too - love the solo. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Starla\\" - positively euphoric. A monumental eleven-minute song with tons of guitars - effects-laden, epic and otherworldly. Fantastic live - so I've heard as I haven't seen them, but I've got a great bootleg of this song that segues into a spacey \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" by Depeche Mode. Most likely my fav SP song ever. *****+<br /><br />\\"Blue\\" - a bad-ass bass line kicks off this steady rocker that also features some lovely, plaintive tangents. Dates back to their earliest days. *****<br /><br />\\"Girl Named Sandoz\\" - A cover of an old one by the Animals, this is a cool rocker that's a little campy and slightly cheesy thanks mainly to the lyrics. I'm into it! ****<br /><br />\\"La Dolly Vita\\" - smooth and dreamy rocker - \\"cool as ice cream\\" - this one has an almost hypnotic atmosphere, until it peaks with a potent climax. It's my favorite here, after \\"Starla\\" and \\"Plume.\\" *****<br /><br />\\"Spaced\\" - an experimental atmospheric piece with distorted, dub-heavy vocals. Sounds like it's sleepily drifting through the cosmos as Corgan's strange ruminations to his father hover in the background. Unusual and interesting track. ***1/2<br /><br />Anyone who likes the Smashing Pumpkins will find a lot to like here - it's not just for completist fans by any means. I've listened to it for years since it came out and don't expect to ever stop. Although it understandably doesn't have the coherence of a typical \\"normal\\" album release, it's still very listenable. Actually, it's no less coherent than MELON COLLIE AND THE INFINITE SADNESS now that I think about it. I'd say it's my second favoritePumpkins record, after SIAMESE DREAM.Pumpkins record, after SIAMESE DREAM.
B00000JJQK|4.0|The musical 'elite' will often say that Pet Sounds sits atop the giant mantle of all albums ever released. That is a huge statement to make about any album. Personally, I think the album is good in small doses. It has been wonderfully mixed, arranged and produced, but really is over-rated. The album was born out of Brian Wilsons desire to top the Beatles who had taken the US, and the world, by storm. The album should really be known as Brian Wilson feat. The Beachboys, although all would agree Carls singing on 'God Only Knows' is truly great. Brian is often credited for 'his' masterpiece album, but what about his 'altered concious state' whilst writing alot of it, I think that had a good deal to do with some of the lyrics. There is no doubt Brian is a genius when arranging vocal parts and it is all on show here, a la the acapella singing on Sloop John B, which happens to be one of my favourite songs on the album. I saw Brian perform Pet Sounds live in Sydney and it truly blew me away. That though, was something that you just can't reproduce on any album. In summary a good album with some unusual songs which may not be to everyone's fancy.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Most television shows (and movies for that matter) are so predictable. It is frustrating that writers seem completely unable to come up with original ideas. I'm not going to say that the premise of Veronica Mars is totally unique, even I couldn't resist the Buffy comparison, but the scripts are. Never in my life has a show left me gasping with surprise over the way events unfold, as this show has. If you're looking for a well written, surprising and interesting show, check out Veronica Mars. You won't be disappointed.
B000001ESN|5.0|This album (1980) and \\"Moving Pictures\\" (1981) were probably considered the best releases ever by Rush. The tracks contained in both are very recognizable since many classic rock stations have aired at least one or two of them - almost an everyday ritual it seems. It was possible that this was the reason why Rush during a live performance would open up with \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" on most of their tours. That was exactly the case when I attended a concert on September 14, 1984 in Portland, Maine together with some old friends who were, by the way, die-hard Rush fans.    Other tracks of interest: \\"Free Will\\" has a great sound and a very catchy chorus if you listen to it long enough. You can't help but sing along. Three of the remaining tracks: \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", \\"Entre Nous\\" and \\"Natural Science\\" contain lyrics that, like many of Rush's other tracks, are kind of educational in the world of science. In \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", the theme is about weather. \\"Entre Nous\\" compares the human element with certain objects as planets, passing ships or islands and that we all have spaces in between. \\"Natural Science\\" the longest track on the album is about small marine life. One would think about the everyday life of arthropods such as plankton or other small crustaceans living along the shallows of any rocky shoreline. Lastly \\"Different Strings\\" one would think about a tale dating back to medieval times, particularly in the opening verse.    This is a great album for any Rush fan together with \\"Moving Pictures\\" I consider both as my personal favorites. These two albums alone could have easily been one album very much like two previously released albums \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" (1977) and \\"Hemispheres\\" (1978).
B000002LEE|5.0|Every Jane's Addiction album needs to be listened to very carefully to like it.This is a strong album that is needed by both veterans ad rookies to JA. Jane Says is perfect song that only retards don't like. It is the only song I've ever heard from JA of P4P that has really good songwriting. All the other tracks good to. But Jane Says is just perfect.
B0007TFI92|5.0|This is the last release of TD's \\"pink years\\" and its definintly their best from that era. The songs are so errie and beautiful and many parts of them to seem like they were'nt even created by human beings. Like they emerged from darkness from below the earth and one's unconsious mind.The 20 minute opening title track starts with a pounding drum sequence that suddenly stops and releases into long ambient passages of sound. The second track seems to take you on a ambient journey through a strange forest with its light textures and nature-like sounds. This album is so ethereal and otherworldy but unlike TD's  previous albums this one seems to express more \\"inner and personal space rather than outer-space. The 3rd track gets really haunting and finally \\"wahn\\" the brief final track turns back to more paranoid sounds with its primal screaming, voice fragments and beating drums. This is one of the best ambient albums I've ever heard and does'nt sound out dated at all (unlike  the first 3 \\"pink year\\" albums. )
B000002HMH|5.0|All the true METALLICA fans should stand behind the biggest heavy metal act ever. Kirk Hammet added a different sound durning this time of the bands direction. Just remember it takes a gifted person to play Metallica I hope the era of heavy metal takes over again, rap SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
006072448X|5.0|This book is brilliant. Is it pretty? No. Is it comfortable? Infrequently. And the narrator is sometimes blissfully, breathtaking unpleasant. Why blissfully? One of the cultural problems Lionel Shriver appears to want to discuss -as suggested nowhere less forcefully than the title -is the very real phenomenon of a mother struggling to love her child. The fact that it is so sad, and so tragic, does not make it any less real, and Shriver has done us a favor by reminding us of that. As for criticism that we only get \\"her side of the story\\" -that's precisely the point. She is a case-book unreliable narrator, and it's up to us to weigh her story against the evidence we have.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Michael Jackson is the best artist who has ever lived in my opinion!!!!! Unfortunately, SONY will be able to release as many Best of`s as they want to... That`s the deal... I think people are waiting too much from MJ. His health is kinda bad... We have to be patient and wait for new stuff. I`m sure the new CD will be great!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|the first time i listened to it i was like omg this is freakin' awesome!  i luv all of the songs!  you'll like her if you like pop rock like choronic future and the new hilary duff.  peace up, a town down ya'll!
B000777J2S|5.0|This is an amazing cd. How anyone could give this less than 5 stars is proof that some people are too precious. The Boy George duet is AMAZING. So is the Lou Reed number. All I can say is thank god I took a chance and bought this CD. So far my fave CD purchase of 2005.
B000002I25|5.0|This is what started the whole LA rock sound.  Nothing will ever top it, Nothing!  It definetely broke ground for those who didn't want to write tripe Top 40 love songs as a basis for a music career.
0156027321|5.0|This book is not just a story of a boy who was cast away in a row boat with a man-eating Tiger.  This is a story of survival and understanding on a very elementary level.  We all have a Richard Parker.... Something/Someone that keeps us from flipping out and over in our rowboat of life (or we invent it).  It is proof that people can and will survive anything if they have imagination and endurance.  I hope this author will continue to write imaginative fiction like this with so many hidden and thoughtful messages.  This book could save your life if you could open your mind to its message. The most dangerous animal in the zoo.  This book is great... I will buy it and read it over and over.  This is not a book you read and forget. It is a keeper!!
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I will not buy this album ever until i can burn it to an ipod or make a duplicate. i never use an original cd extensively and i won't stand for anything but the highest kbps.  so, having not heard it, i soundly give it (and the recording label, and dave and co.,) 1 star for not meeting the expectations of a demanding consumer. in fact, the only way  I know to get it in the format i want is to COPY IT ILLEGALLY.  If anyone knows how to download it at kbps greater than 128, write a review and tell me.  I'd love to know how.  I wish itunes had 3 options, say 192, 256, or 320 kbps, to choose from.<br /><br />Futhermore, it IS a violation of law not to allow a person to make as many copies (as long as it is for personal use) as he/she wishes.  If you use an ipod along with cd players in room/car/etc. like I do, buying a cd and burning another one or two (35 cents to protect a $16 investment) makes sense.<br /><br />As for you folks sucking down one i tune after another at 128 kbps, you should be ashamed of yourselves.  Demand cd quality stuff.  Yeah, I know.  Some of you say, \\"I can't hear the difference.\\"  Someday you'll want run your tunes through a receiver and nice speakers and you'll say, \\"sh*t!  that's nasty!\\"<br /><br />And for reference, I'm a school teacher, making less than 40k.  So yeah, a buck means something to me.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|The Strokes' second effort really doesn't add anything too terribly new or broad to their catalog, but it does continue what they did on their previous album: garage rock with a 70s sound and a modern sensibility.  <br /> <br />The album clocks in at a breezy 33 minutes, which makes each song on average exactly 3 minutes, showing something moderately impressive: during a short period of time, a band can create an album just as good as, say, Metallica's Black Album, which clocks in at maybe double the time but is overall no better than this. <br /> <br />Anyways, what the hell am I doing comparing The Strokes and Metallica? Two totally different bands. Anyways, Julian Casablancas' low, sometimes near-mumbling voice is sometimes hard to hear over the distorted guitars that basically play simple riffs until a short solo opportunity comes up.  <br /> <br />Room on Fire is a good album, fun to listen to if you are bored, but it really has only one real standout track for me, and that is the single \\"Reptilia\\". Pumping with energy and aggression that the rest of this relatively mild album doesn't have, it features Casablancas screaming through parts of it, the album derives its title from a line from the song, and features a short but very enjoyable solo. \\"Reptilia\\" is clearly the best song on Room on Fire, and I'm wondering if that is maybe a hint to the direction The Strokes will be taking. If so, I'm content. <br /> <br />The Strokes' second album is listenable, but it just doesn't have a whole lot of energy or passion that perhaps they will learn to find on their third.
B00003CXBK|2.0|The animation was beautiful but the story was way too long; it just seemed to be a comedy of tragedies. That's all I have to say.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|The copy protection makes it impossible for me to use this CD the way I normally would, so I have decided not to buy it. <br /> <br />Congratulations, RCA, you have cost yourself a sale.
B0002OERI0|5.0|To all you people who can't say anything but I hate this album and die or whatever - come up with something better than words in all caps and exclamation points, and get real.  No one can deny the talent this album displays, especially when compared to Dookie because it shows how diverse Green Day can be and they have talent no matter what kind of songs they write; both albums sold millions of copies and critics raved about them both. <br />     Is Green Day mainstream? yes, I dare you to tell me what is wrong with mainstream Green Day, they still say what ever they want in the songs they write.  People are missing out on a lot of great music because they get offended when a band signs a big deal or something.  DOes that deminish talent? no. Why is Green Day all over the radio? not becuase they are sucky musicians, that's for sure. <br />     I'm prepared to say Green Day is one of the greatest rock bands of the 90's and early 00's.  They have always been my favorite band.  It's too bad people don't like bands because the band got away from the class or clique they grew up in, or the band is suddenly recognized for being talented by being played on the radio (not that radio exposure implies talent or lack of radio exposure implies lack of talent). <br />     I love the album, every song all the way through.  If Ray Charles hadn't just died and been up for it too, Green Day would have gotten the Best Album grammy in addition to Best Rock Album.  The first 5 or so are the best.  I was also impressed with the transitions from one part to another in Jesus Of Suburbia.  I don't think one song sounds like another on this CD. <br />
B0007P3582|3.0|This CD has sold extremely well and has produced some huge hits, such as \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Just a Lil Bit,\\" which are played approximately every 6.8 minutes on MTV.  50 Cent is just as big headed as ever and keeps going on about how successful he is and how one day he hopes he'll be where Eminem and Dr Dre are lyrically.  Ha!  You wish! <br /> <br />50 doesn't really rap, he just mumbles some uncreative lyrics that my guinea pig could have written.  On \\"Candy Shop\\" he raps about \\"licking the lollipop.\\"  On \\"Just a Lil Bit\\" he says something like, \\"I don't need a lot, just a lil bit, all a n*gger really needs is a lil bit, not a lot baby just a lil bit.\\"  Ugh... <br /> <br />Considering his lyrical capabilities, one should probably view 50 Cent as an artist who makes party songs.  Dr Dre was able to come up with some excellent beats on this album.  The beats are very distinctive and danceable, but as I said, 50's flow can't really keep up.   <br /> <br />It looks like 50's popularity is taking a bit of a plunge, however.  This is only his second CD and he already seems to be dissing everyone in sight and acting as though he were Tupac's goddamn resurrection or something.  He has been on several tracks dissing Ja Rule and murder inc.  He dropped The Game from his label for two weeks for no apparent reason (eventually Dr Dre forced him to take him back.)  Fame seems to have gotten to his head and the public is starting to realize that.   <br /> <br />All in all I'd rate this CD 2  stars, which I'll round up to 3, mainly for the awesome beats and the few hit singles.   <br />
B000001C6M|4.0|Slayer's Show No Mercy and Metallica's Kill `Em All, have always been considered to be similar to one another.  They were both the Debut albums of the bands and were both immature compared to their later works and both released in 1983.  This isn't the Classic Slayer that would appear with Reign in Blood, but this is still Slayer and it still kills.  Containing obvious influences such as Judas Priest, we are given classic Slayer Material like Die by the Sword, Black Magic (my favorite one here), the Antichrist, etc.  The production isn't the best, but it is the best of all 4 of their Metal Blade releases.  Lyricwise, it isn't that great either and compared to their later works, a lot of this is rather cheesy, but that is overlooked as the songs are so good.  But look back at the fact that this was released in 1983, and this probably was one of the fastest things out there at it's time.  Although it has aged a bit, this is still grade A Slayer.  This is by no means their best album, but is still pretty damn good and worthy of more than a few glances.  This isn't necessarily the best place to start with Slayer, but it will eventually find its way into your collection.   <br /> <br />Interesting fact: there's a Polish edition on Metal mind Records that has a misprinted title on the Cassette.  It says \\"Slayer-Show the Mercy\\".   <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|In a music industry full of one hit wonders, lip syncing and computer generated songs, true talents such as Mariah Carey are difficult to find.  Carey has a unique style, is an interesting personality and most importantly has a gorgeous, distinctive voice.  I'm not trying to bash artists like Jennifer Lopez, who have had many hits despite having a flat, bland voice.  I do like some songs like that, but sometimes it's also nice to listen to a real SINGER.  Carey has had such a wide range of hit songs, from beautiful ballads such as \\"Through the Rain,\\" to amazing collaborations such as \\"One Sweet Day\\" with Boys II Men to remixes such as \\"Lover boy\\" featuring Ludacris.  This album includes all of that and more.  There's truly something for every fan. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with her first single, \\"It's Like That,\\" a fun, poppy club number.  It hit #16 on the US charts and did slightly better in Europe.  All in all a fun first single, a great choice to kick off the summer. <br /> <br />The second song is her second single, \\"We Belong Together,\\" which has been a number one hit in the USA for many weeks, making her on of the most successful artists of all time.  The beat and lyrics are calm and soothing.  Carey hits the high notes extremely well.  The music video is great too, which is a follow up to the \\"It's Like That\\" video (very clever idea!) <br /> <br />There are a few great hip hop infused songs, such as \\"Get Your Number\\" featuring Jermaine Dupri and \\"Say Something\\" featuring Snoop Dogg.  I'm aware that this style might not be for everyone, especially some older Mariah fans, but their voices and styles do collaborate well. <br /> <br />Last but not least, there are also some extremely passionate and beautiful ballads on this album, Mariah's specialty.  My personal favorite is \\"Fly Like A Bird.\\"  Her voice is absolutely stunning.  A great way to end the album! <br /> <br />The bottom line is that Carey has proven that she's one of the most talented, hardestworking artists around.  Her talents truly shine on this gem.  I really didn't think she would ever be able to top some of her previous albums but damn, she really proved me wrong.  <br />

B0009A40ES|4.0|I'm frustrated about giving this movie 4 stars and not 5 stars but because of the random and disgusting sex scenes, it got punched down to 4. Besides that, the movie is great. I was expecting a solid movie and it blew away my expectations. Oh, and by the way, I didn't see the unrated version but saw the original theatrical version. After watching the theatrical trailer, I thought that it would be very horrifying and disturbing. But, on the contrary, my friend! The movie is absolutely hilarious! The way that it is made makes it such that you'll laugh instead of being horrified. The gruesome deaths are made in a way that they're actually really funny. Here are some funn moments: <br />1. Patrick Bateman goes to get his sheets washed at a company but gets mad when they say that they can't get out the red stain on them. He claims that it's juice, cran apple. But, of course it isn't.  <br />2. Patrick puts newspaper all around a place where a guy's sitting at his house. And then puts on a rain coat. I wonder why. <br />The movie is about Patrick Bateman, a rich Wall Street man who's obsessed with killing people. From bums to friends that he doesn't like to random women.  <br />The movie isn't disturbing because the violence is made in such a comic matter that you laugh out loud, and then maybe feel guilty. But, boy, it's funny. The movie is very exciting and interesting and keeps you into it until its great ending. I loved the ending and found it to be very unpredictable but makes sense. And the comic violence made sense to me now. I recommend this awesome movie and Christian Bale's perfromance is stunning. No one else could have done. Call me crazy, but I would have given him an oscar. He deserved it. <br />And for parents nervous for their children that want to see it, I feel that 13 years + are good ages or mature children. The movie doesn't have a lot of cuss words but has some and the violence isn't really shown. You see the blood on Bateman's face and a body in thebackground but it's made comically. But, the random sex scenes are perverted so I recommend just closing your eyes. That's what I did.  <br />This is a worthy rent and even a worthy buy. Too bad for the sex scenes, or else it definitely deserved 5 stars.
B00005JNZ4|4.0|Over the past several years, starting with \\"Man on the Moon\\" and extending through \\"Unfaithful\\" and particularly including \\"Under the Tuscan Sun,\\" Diane Lane has re-built a career as a quietly sexy, unbelievably beautiful, mature (meaning over 40...but who is counting?) actress.<br />Lane's very presence on the screen makes you feel comfortable and gives you hives because she is so human, so humane, so thoughtful and emotionally available. She's the new Jessica Lange or Meryl Streep without the angst and paranoia.<br />\\"Must Love Dogs\\" is not the best movie Lane has been in nor is it the worst. The screenplay lacks the spark of \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" and the emotional weight of \\"Man on the Moon\\" or \\"Unfaithful.\\" But damn it all, I'll grab at any chance I can to catch a glimpse of Lane's smile or to hear her laugh.<br />Lane is so gracious and giving an actress that she let's a big huge black dog steal many of their scenes together in this movie.<br />But who cares? She could sit in a chair in front of the camera and read the want ads and I would be enthralled. In short, Diane Lane is Mother Earth, someone you'd like as a best friend or the girlfriend you never had. She is Love, She is Womanhood, She is just so darn appealing.
B0006U4UAU|2.0|i'm sorry to inform fans of LCD Soundsystem of the following: monotony can easily be mistaken for intricate and artistic subtlety. unfortunately, this album presents the former and is credited with the latter. just because you have a good drum and bass line doesn't mean you shouldn't deviation from it-- use some samples to compliment it and allow it to blossom (and don't try to get away with ripping off a beatles riff and repeating it for five minutes). as far as alternative dance goes, your better off with the avalanches or dj shadow. this is just a more tedious version of the talking head's remain in light album. fah.
B00009W0WM|5.0|A film for all time! Its got Bogey, a hot girlfriend and Nazi's trying to make their day. Plus you got some great music and wonderful lines like \\"I stick my neck out for no man!\\". If you need more you are either brain dead or have no soul. Anyone who loves film should realy think about getting this DVD for their collection.
B00006HAZG|3.0|I was planning on writing a longer review than this, but I read Lawrence G Coatney \\"Geno\\"'s review and he said pretty much everything I wanted to say about this production. 3 hours is not NEARLY enough time to cover this 900-page novel. It needs at least 6, and 9 would be even better. It really couldn't have been any better of a production in any way except the length. The costumes, sets, acting are all wonderful. But the limited time of 3 hours just doesn't allow for the thorough portrayal that this book deserves. Since many of the 'key' events in the novel that can't be left out are somewhat depressing, the overall impression from watching this show is that the book must be very depressing. But that's only because all the 'in between' uplifting and enjoyable occurences had to be chopped out to fit in the 3-hour time frame. The book presents a much more balanced life (i.e. not sad all the time) and is much more fulfilling. Until a longer version comes out that does justice to the incredible richness and detail of the book, I recommend just sticking to reading (or listening to) the book.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|there are some cool ideas here, but SOAD is getting extremely repetitive IMO. every song has basically the same exact beat played at different tempos. the riffs are all pretty much cookie-cutter hooky riffs that don't make you say \\"wow that's a f**king awesome riff\\". nothing SOAD has released since their debut album has come close to capturing that magic. they don't try to fully realize their ideas musically. each song relies more on the lyrics themselves rather than the manner they are presented in. i just can't help but think of songs like \\"Ddevil\\" and \\"War?\\" that not only stood out lyrically, but had a totally unique way of presenting the ideas to you musically that SOAD just hasn't been able to match since. the closest they got to that style was \\"X\\" and \\"Chop-Suey\\", and there is NOTHING on this album that's even as good as those 2 songs, IMO.     i know that bands must progress, but i wouldn't call this progression. while Serj is still a good vocalist with an original voice, the anger is no longer there. you just don't hear SOAD using the same kind of vocal dynamic they used years ago, instead they just try to rehash the magic they captured with songs like \\"Sugar\\" but it's just cheap. it's like they only do it so people will get a kick out of it and think it's funny. and the heavy edge is basically gone altogether.     i wasn't huge on Toxicity either, but it's WAYYY better than this. this album is kind of goofy with cheap, annoying harmonies that are [dare i say?] punkish. there was a time when SOAD could've been considered a metal band, but now they're like a hybrid punk band with \\"catchy\\" [weak] hooks. better than Blink 182, but not much. it doesn't seem like the band even take themselves seriously anymore. i appreciate what they're trying to do, but i think they dropped the ball years ago. they took \\"Spiders\\" and \\"Sugar\\" - the two most popular songs from their debut - and used those same formulas to base tunes on ever since. those two songs were the only ones that strayed on that first album from what SOAD seemed to be all about at the time, and IMO \\"Sugar\\" and \\"Spiders\\" were the two weakest songs on the album. yet, SOAD have basically shaped their \\"personality\\" and their sound out of those two songs.     i haven't been huge on a SOAD release since the first album came out. they've had some good songs that were released as b-sides, but they were all written years ago. if you were a fan of the first SOAD album, and you've been hoping and waiting for them to come out with something that can even compare to it, you won't find it here. that album will never come again. SOAD have basically become a bad imitation of themselves.
0385338082|1.0|This story was ridiculously predictable and annoying. <br />The main character is often in situations that she supposedly finds unbearable, but does nothing to change them when she easily could(being \\"forced\\" into a hideous costume at the company picnic, being put down by family members constantly, being stuck with her family while Jack is waiting for her).  I could go on and on.   <br />She's just a complete idiot and I could not relate to her.  It  makes me wonder how I'm supposed to believe that any man is interested in her, much less a brilliant, successful marketing genius.

B0009XNUK0|2.0|This set gives the impression of gathering many of Michael's hits together in their edited 45rpm single versions for the first time.  But a close listen reveals that four songs -- Off the Wall, Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', Human Nature, and The Way You Make Me Feel -- were instead newly edited down from the ALBUM VERSIONS... a problem, since the original singles for those four were REMIXES, and have still never appeared on CD!  Strange and upsetting that Sony would try to pass them off as the single versions.  If they didn't have the correct tapes, they should have used the full-length album versions... not try to pass them off for something they're not. <br /> <br />Also, the sound is too loud, overly maximized, which compresses the dynamic range and flattens out the sound. <br /> <br />On the plus side, we do get the US CD debut of the 45 mixes of Another Part of Me and In the Closet.  But where is the single mix of \\"Smooth Criminal\\"?  Instead we get the album version, sans the heavy breathing on the intro that was originally part of the song.  And why no \\"Jam\\"?  Instead we get the album version of \\"Dangerous,\\" which was not even a US single. <br /> <br />Two stars for what this set could have been, and is not.
0517548232|5.0|This is a marvelous, easy-to-read, and alarming short book. As I read through the consequences of all the tinkering government has done to our \\"mixed\\" economy, I grew increasingly alarmed at governmental intervention in every domain of our lives, both private and economic. As Hazlitt demonstrates in chapter after chapter, too little attention is paid to the long-term consequences of economic and political decisions. Over and over again, special interests get their way over the common good. When government steals from the taxpayer to reward special interests, the consequences are more like dominos than a straight win-lose transaction. It's time we all took long-term consequences into consideration before more damage is done.<br /><br />Take for example the \\"energy\\" bill that, as I write, passed Congress. With more than $10B in \\"financial incentives,\\" \\"tax breaks,\\" and \\"direct subsidies\\" to oil producers, all this measure does is (1) further increase our dependence on oil, (2) continue our reliance on foreign imports, and (3) further delay the time when alternative fuels are used to replace polluting gases into the environment. What's temporarily good for the oil companies is not good for the rest of us over the long haul. So, this \\"energy bill\\" will take $10B out of taxpayers' pockets and line the oil companies pockets so that the cost of gasoline will go down. Does this make sense? We pay either way, obviously.<br /><br />Take another example: Rent control. I live in a city that has had it for over 20 years. Not one new apartment complex has been built in all those years. Not one! In addition to rent control, the city has imposed a moratorium on houses over three-storeys tall. While population is exploding, housing is scarce and affordable only to the extraordinarily wealthy. Meanwhile, I pay half the rent my neighbor next door pays, but I couldn't afford to \\"move up\\" because there are no new apartments to choose from! They also are occupied by \\"sitters\\" under rent control. The poor have already moved out, and now there's an exodus of the middle class. San Francisco is only for those under rent control or the very wealthy who can afford million-dollar homes. All because of two policies meant to help the public: (1) Rent control, and (2) building moratoria.<br /><br />Capitalism, obviously, is not a perfect system, but it certainly is the best system compared to the alternatives. Hazlitt, while showing the deficiencies of the alternatives, does not address some of the crucial problems with capitalism itself. Take for example wealth. The rich capitalist can afford to take risks, while the middle class can't afford much risk at all, and the poor are lucky to survive. How does one break out of  the vicious circle of haves and have nots? Otherwise, the rich stay rich, the poor stays poor, and everyone remains financially the same. Only venture capitalists, who already have the money, can offer those who don't some chance of improving their lot. Is this the only way to get ahead?<br /><br />Even with questions like these unanswered, this is an important book and a critical read for every citizen. We all need to think \\"ahead\\" and not just think provincially. We must think of the \\"domino\\" consequences of all our temporary fixes. They usually beget more problems than they solve. Hazlitt tackles them all: Public works, taxation, foreign aid and \\"credit,\\" bureaucracy, spread-the-work schemes, the export-import disputes, tariffs, pricing parity, saving obsolete industries, ignoring the pricing system, stabilizing commodities, minimum wage, inflation, and others. All under 200 easy-to-read pages. Highly recommended.ent control. The poor have already moved out, and now there's an exodus of the middle class.

B00005JKMQ|5.0|Watching this DVD I thought, why did Cassius Clay / Muhammad Ali refuse to emigrate to Canada or anywhere else (Monaco, Paris, London, Rome, Cairo, Beirut), starting his statements living there in luxury? Isn't it neurotic to stay in the USA and allow the US white establishment to ruin my own sources (financially and mentally)? In the heart of all considerations is Ali's refusal to be drafted into the Army. His favorite sentences: (1) \\"Why should I go to Vietnam killing people who never said NIGGER to me?\\" (2) \\"The USA is my enemy, not the Vietcong...\\" these sentences, sent from abroad, would have developed their power as well, would have been a more effective support of his \\"boxing for justice and liberty\\" with shaky methods. And secondly I thought, watching this DVD: \\"The Clash Of Civilizations\\", the present never ending feud between Christian establishment and Muslim neighborhoods - did this start in the 1960's, when Muhammad Ali and America's fiery civil-rights leader Malcolm X became great political heroes? Nowadays: Ain't there any ways to respect each other? Is the present society a better one as the scene in the years 1964 - 1974, which brought Muhammad Ali a very bitter life? The fresh occurrence of this screen-work made me think like this, and I am convinced, some other viewers will feel similar things. But: Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. were gunned down, Muhammad Ali still is a living hero you can grant some honors (summer 1996 in Atlanta, the Champ holding the Olympic torch); evident: something of his style has been the right method ...
B0000524CY|4.0|Basically, some archaeologists find a statue of the Babylonian demon called Pazuzu.  The evil spirit of Pazuzu travels out into the world and decides, for some unexplained reason, to inhabit the body of a young girl named Regan.  What winds up happening is a whirlwind of \\"scary\\" occurrences as Regan's mother (Ellen Burstyn) calls upon some priests to perform an exorcism on her daughter.  Sound preposterous?  This movie was actually based on a best-selling novel, which was Allegedly Based on True Events (just like \\"Amityville Horror\\" and \\"Mothman Prophecies\\" years later).   <br /> <br />Now, I came of age in the late 1990s, the so-called \\"Blair Witch\\" era (which is still going on today), and by own personal standards this movie isn't all that shocking or scary.  There are senses of anxiety, tension and anticipation hanging in the air as you watch it, but ... for those of you that were born AFTER 1980, don't buy into the whole \\"scariest movie of all time\\" thing.  I don't exactly know what the scariest movie of all time actually is; I don't pretend to be an authority on the matter; the preceding was my own interpretation, mind you. <br /> <br />Just the same, the book and the movie were both huge hits.  The movie wound up receiving ten Oscar nominations, though I don't think Ellen Burstyn warranted enough screen time to receive her citation for Best Actress.  By early 1970s standards \\"The Exorcist\\" IS a technical masterpiece, and established a benchmark for horror movies well after the film's theatrical run.  <br /> <br />By the way ... if anyone wants to see what Ellen Burstyn was REALLY capable of, check out 1974's \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" or 2000's \\"Requiem for a Dream.\\"
B000050XEI|5.0|I am really sick and tired of people who come on here and say bad things about the things we like! take Enya for example--\\"This music is sooooo boring!\\"or\\"this is such lame crap! i dont know why anyone would listen to it.\\" Okay, those type of people have no taste for good music. So they decide to come on here and write bad things about it. I am not saying its bad to have different opinions but those type of people bug the hell out of me!...this album is wonderful and beautiful--i luv wild child and only time. Any one who appreciates Enya's music should buy this cd. Enya is the best ever!

630433186X|1.0|Someone out there is going to hate me for this review, and so be it; we are all entitled to our opinions. And here is mine:  <br /> <br />I knew this was a musical from the get-go, and I am not fond of musicals, but I decided to give it a chance since I do like Richard Harris, and any good medieval tale. I rented this out just to see how closely the thing rode out to the true King Arthur legend. It was WRETCHED. I suppose the costumes are great if you like watching gala balls or modern model wear for the rich elite of the 60s, but no way in hell does it come close to looking anything like the real time era it's attempting to depict. The styles are all over the place and everything from the armor, weaponry and castle decor are like a conglomerated hodgepodge of design from all over the world. I guess if you have enough faith that Richard Harris can sing, then you can muster up enough faith to believe that this disastrous fairy-tale kingdom really existed somewhere at some time, but if you're a stickler for realism and accuracy (even in fantasy tales) like me, it will drive you mad. <br /> <br />As for the singing, or I should say, \\"singing,\\" the actors making goo-goo eyes at each other as they swell with exaggerated emotion is just flat out nauseating. Watching Harris reel around in disbelief making those soggy sad-eyes while crooning with a cracked voice just grated on my spine like fingernails on a chalkboard. Despite the stars in the cast, the acting is shallow, fake, and not very believable all-around. Probably the only outstanding performance was by a dashing young David Hemmings, decked-out in leather as deliciously evil Mordred, whom we hardly get to see very much of, but is actually a key player in the downfall of Arthur, his relationship, his position as king, and his knights. He's the only one in the cast that had any kind of singing ability, and that, unfortunately, ended up on the cutting room floor. What a shame. <br /> <br />The whole thing is a bloatedbag of overblown, overlong and overdone pageantry. I guess if you like outrageous costumes and actors cast as singers who never had any vocal training, this movie will delight you. It seemed to drag on FOREVER (it even gives you a mid-movie intermission...to brew yourself some strong coffee and try to wake up, I suppose) and then ends abruptly, after leaving out big chunks of the actual legend. If I didn't know how the story went beforehand, I doubt the movie would have even made very much sense at all. The ending is so sudden, it feels as though they wanted to go on for another 3 hours but had to just wrap it up since they'd made it such a drawn-out, painful mess already.  <br /> <br />If I'd seen this as an actual stage production, perhaps I'd have had a different opinion of it. If you saw all that pageantry in real life I imagine it'd have much more of an impact. On DVD, however, and even as a movie on a big screen, it's little more than a sparkly Christmas ball - decorative, but empty inside.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Well. Linkin Park. A band that I once listened to about 4 years ago. I thought it was ok back then, when Hybrid Theory was released and Linkin Park took teenagers by storm. However, my musical taste hadn't developed, and I just wasn't fond of rapping, screaming, and singing about how bad your lives are. Plus, when it comes to rock/metal ingredients, this band has barely any. I would later on stumble onto my favorite band which I listen to soo much (Iron Maiden), which consists of very catchy riffs, blazing guitar solos,  good drumwork, powerful vocal performances, intelligent lyrics, and of course, the best bass player to ever live. After finally finding my taste, I look back at Linkin Park, and it just doesn't cut it. Its so boring. Its like if the the album where one entire song. I didn't write this review to try to make you hate Linkin Park, or try to convert you to my favorite band. I wrote this review to encourage music fans to develop their own musical tastes while ignoring whatever is mainstream (after all, if you like a band only because they are famous, then you really don't like them). I also wrote this review to warn potential buyers. This album is boring, unoriginal, and has some very childish lyrics.
B00005JNSK|3.0|The original 1971 movie \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" is still the best version, especially since author Roald Dahl wrote the script.  Any deviations he made from his book must be okay because he allowed it to happen.      In the original, Gene Wilder, captured the eccentricity of Willy Wonka with a bit of warmth and whimsy.  Johnny Depp captured Wonka's eccentricity in typical cooky Tim Burton fashion.  While Wilder's Wonka was no big fan of the four naughty brats, he was never mean to them, even when they learned their lessons the hard way.  The worthy child left standing would make himself known.  Depp's Wonka seemed as if he designed to elminate the ones he didn't like. That just bugged me. A man wanting to keep his vision alive with the right child shouldn't seem so hasty to produce a winner.      Another flaw of the new version are the kids that were cast.  One exception is the role of Charlie.  I actually prefer Freddie Highmore.  The brats in the new movie were weaker versions of their original counterparts.  Varuca Salt is my favorite.  She truly was a loud, impatient and indignant spoiled brat.  The newer Varuca Salt didn't seem that bratty at all.  I mean, a band named themselves after her.  They wouldn't do so if she wasn't so memorable.  Even worse were the parents's reactions to their naughty children's mischeviousness.  In the original, the parents actually freaked out as concerned parents would.  In the newer version, the parents just idly watched, mouth agape, barely uttering a word as if they were just going with the flow.    Boat scene in the new version:  LAME!  The original was far more memorable. It's the scene we all think of when we you mention \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\".    Oompa Loompas in the original and their songs...better.  Enough said.    Finally, what was the point of the flashbacks to Wonka's childhood?  Completely unncessary.    Despite all that, the film exhibited true Tim Burton style and aesthetics. If itwas only for those reasons, then the new version would have been a great film.  Otherwise, if you want the dreamy tale of a kid, a chocolatier and his factory, stick to the original.
0596009208|5.0|I like writing reviews on technical books because I think they are of enormous value to those considering buying the book. I buy a lot of books online and the reviews that I read are by far the most important thing that influences my decision to buy. Or not. <br />I also like to read what others before me have written. In this case - and for all of the \\"Head First\\" books I have read - I heartily agree with what virtually all others have written: these books are a great way to learn complicated, and oftentimes boring, subject material.  <br />So I won't rehash what others have already written, except to say that if what you read was good - believe it. <br />I think the most important thing I can say about this book is that I agree with what Hye Nyoun Eum Kim wrote: NOT for beginners. I remember thinking to myself throughout the book that a fair, or at least some, amount of Java knowledge would be necessary in order to understand what the authors were covering. <br />If you already know Java and want to know it better, buy this book. If you are new to Java, and especially if you are new to programming, I still recommend buying this book. But do yourself a favor - check out other introductory Java books and buy one of those as well. A good starting point? I have bought the \\"Just Java\\" (by Peter van der Linden) books ever since Java 1.0 came out.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Watching this movie is like watching a whole week worth of sad and heart breaking news into a movie. You don't want to watch it but you can't help watching it... and in the end it breaks your heart but it gives you a new perspective on drug addicts life... especially young drug addicts life and the danger of prescribed drugs too. Superb and great acting... it feels as if you were living this characters lives for yourself and you cant help but feel for them and wanting to make it better but not being able to. GREAT MOVIE SOON TO BE CLASSIC!

B000002UZ1|4.0|No compilation, especially not a Beatles compilation, is perfect. But this is one of the better collections on the market. Though Strawberry Fields is a filler song, the other selections are strong ones. You get classics such as Penny Lane, A Day in the Life, Get Back, Lady Madonna, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Come Together and Let It Be.<br />However, it's impossible to make a perfect Beatles comp in two discs. Missing in action are Fixing a Hole, When I'm Sixty-Four, Savoy Truffle, Blackbird, You Never Give Me Your Money, Because, Rain, Dig a Pony and One After 909. But if you're new to the Beatles and have a lot of money, get this and the Red Album.<br />Ignore my comments on Strawberry Fields Forever - I have since seen the error my ways regarding that song, and now love it.
6303042511|2.0|A former reviewer wrote that \\"This story is just like the storyline that Marvel Comics first made.\\"  This couldn't be further from the truth.  Bishop and Gambit had absolutely nothing to do with the original Days of Future Past storyline.  I vastly prefer the storyline as it was presented in the actual comic books.
B000007U6V|5.0|To say that these guys were influential is to say the absolute least. It is only 1974 and these guys and using synths like it is an everyday thing. Without this album where would new wave and synth pop be? Nowhere because this is where it started i tell you. No one at the time had heard anything like this at all. I love the track Autobahn when you can hear the car door slamming, starting up, and driving off. The synths on here are amazing. Truly a magnificent experience. Perfect atmosphere for a cool crisp day in the fall when the leaves are falling, the wind blows your hair, and the sun is blocked by the clouds. And then there is Mitternacht which is downright creepy. Seriously this could be used in a horror movie or something I mean how did they come up with this in 1974?!? <br /> <br />I'll leave you to hear the rest and enjoy it for yourself. Oh and the lyrics are in German but trust me it doesn't hurt the album it only adds to its mystery.

B0007P3582|1.0|It's really scary when you consider that people actually listen to this crap. I mean what is so special about this stuff? It is the same beat repeated over and over again with a bunch of stupid lyrics about \\"hos\\" \\"bling-bling\\" \\"street thug gangsta\\" or whatever the hell he sings about. And what really baffles me is that rap is demeaning to women and yet all that girls listen to nowadays is rap. I have yet to meet a girl who even knows bands like Led Zeppelin and Metallica are. I guess women must like being treated like garbage that is the only answer. Now don't get me wrong I am not racist but it pisses me off when white women only date black guys because rap is so popular and because of some stupid rumor that black guys have bigger \\"organs\\" or whatever, which I seriously doubt. Well sorry i got off subject but bottom line is do not buy this, buy music that was actually put together by the musician with hard work and determination. All this 50 Cent loser has to do is play beats on his computer over and over I mean come on a total retard could do that.  <br /> <br />To all you rap fans(especially the females) try listening to rock and not dissing it just because there are no \\"phat beats\\" or whatever. If you actually listened to bands like Black Flag, Stone Temple Pilots, or Pink Floyd to name a few, you might find something you like. Plus rap won't stay popular forever. In the future we'll be looking back and laughing at it just like we do with disco nowadays. So why don't you just put the rap away now and quit embarassing yourself because trust me when I see you guys on TV dancing to this garbage you look like a bunch of baboons with coconuts shoved up your arses.  <br /> <br />Just say no to rap
B000001F6T|3.0|Just like the title, I think these guys were stoned when they did this album. Consequently this was album was realised in 1969 the same year Pink Floyd realised ummagumma, go figure? If you read the liner notes of ssshhhhh I think the record execs were on Alvin Lee and Co. to realise something so they put this out. It doesn't seem like they put a lot of effort into it. There are some good songs such as hear me calling, Sad Song, Going to try and speedkills. But a lot of filler. If you are new to TYA start with SSShhh, A space in time, or Watt.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is truly a monumental release. Remember the good old days of the early 90s when MTV actually played MUSIC and not the college frat boy reality TV crap they play now? The year was 1991 and glam metal was just starting to go out of style and the music scene was giving way to grunge. Pearl Jam simply dominated the scene with this album. Lots of hits on here including Even Flow,Alive,Why Go,Black,Jeremy you name it. Of course there are other great tracks ranging from the hard rocker Once to the calm Oceans. So buy this album and take yourself back to the early 90s when the music really used to mean something.

B00082IJ08|5.0|The Gorillaz second effort at stardom won't put them there, but it may be the best album of 2005. In the new Demon Days, a different approach is taken. Albarn has ditched Del, Dan Nakamura, and Kid Koala from the album, meaning any fans of the band who come along just for hip-hop, will be very disappointed. I was happy with a good medium. Rap is still present, but rock dominates the album. All rapped verses now come in the form of guest appearances. De La Soul obviously fares the best of Feel Good Inc., but the album also features the likes of Roots Manuva and Bootie Brown, appealing to hip-hop enthusiasts. However, hip-hop gets in the way for me, because the sheer beauty of the music is the best presence. Sweeping strings and itchingly catchy melodies abound, this is one feel good album. On the flipside, its intentions are dark and inconspicuous. My favorite tracks are Kids With Guns, O Green World, Dirty Harry, Feel Good Inc, and El Manana because of the delicate nature of the songwriting. On songs such as Feel Good, you are almost scared to listen to them, because you are afraid they will break, as they are the porcelain egg of the music world. Also, it is painfully obvious to me that Albarn is doing his best to make the Gorillaz appear animated, like in the videos. While a nice touch, the music is outright too good to be coming from a cartoon group. Personally, I don't care about the animation. The point is, you will be hard-pressed to find a better album in 2005, and Demon Days is music at its best. I don't care who you are, this music needs to be in your collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Another reviewer stated \\"I am so very angry that FOX took 'Dark Angel' off the air just to put this show on. 'Firefly' didn't even last half of a full season. 15 episodes were produced 3 never aired and they weren't even done filming the first season. Here 'Dark Angel was,one of the most highest ratting shows getting ready for a third season when it gets cancelled so a show that didn't even last a full season can air. I can't believe FOX would cancel such a high rated show.\\" <br /> <br />Let me tell you why such a good show gets cancelled.  Whedon was given the rights to create a new show based on his sucessful forumla or Buffy and Angel.  Fox figured he was money in the bank.  He has had an idea for Firefly for a long time and figured it was time to attempt it.  Fox exec's looked at the pilot episode and got cold feet....they weren't expecting intelligent sci-fi with some substance.  They wanted action - immediate action to draw in viewers, not character development or plot...just action (as if we were cows who will watch anything with explosions and fighting).  So they asked him to come up with the first few episodes to show them where the show was headed. <br /> <br />The 2nd show is what ended up airing first on television.  This was the first stage in Firefly's fall.  The pilot episode contained all the necessary backstory that explained one of the ships main plots - why River and Simon are on the ship and the menace they bring to the crew.  So of course the 2nd episode airs with the crew already established and no backstory for the viewers.....it's just a ship full of people pulling a train heist.   <br /> <br />Then the brainiacs at Fox decide to show the episodes out of order....and for a show that is trying to build a story-arc it really hurt.  That's like showing Babylon5 episodes out of order to someone who's never seen it and expecting them to get interested in the story.  Because it didn't grab the rating they expected (gee i wonder why) they started moving it from night to night in different time slots to see if it grabbed better ratings sometime else. <br /> <br />But what happens to a show that is shown out of order, then switched from night to night with no warning?  You get loyal fans of the show who tune in to find their show not on....left wondering where it is - and some viewers that have never heard of it tuning into it on another night and not being able to follow it cause it's in the middle of the story and they don't know who anyone is.  Fox did not advertise Firefly's timeslot and nightly changes....it was literally different each week. <br /> <br />That was the final nail in the coffin as Fox was left wondering why this unadvertised, timeslot abused show had no viewers....so they cancelled it. <br /> <br />I had been over at a friends house when the episode \\"Ariel\\" was on.  I only saw the last 20 minutes of it but I had always been intrigued.  half a year later I saw the DVD set in the store and decided to take a chance.  Best decision I made.  When my friend watched the DVD with the pilot movie first and all the episodes in order he told me it really cleared up the story for him and made a LOT more sense. <br /> <br />This gave me the same feeling I got when i tuned into the first Babylon5 episode i ever saw - The Coming of Shadows.  Like \\"Ariel\\" it was an episode that makes you want to go back and watch the show from the beginning.  Thanks to the DVD set craze we are able to.  I highly recommend people pick up this relatively inexpensive collection to prepare themselves for the new movie. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Not perfect, but still a nifty little movie with a clever premise and a few good scares.  The opening of the movie is wonderful; two men wake up to find themselves chained up in a dirty bathroom with a dead man on the floor between them.  The rest of the movie, however, tends to get a little too formulaic; we have the bizarre serial killer, the obsessed detective, the good guy who may or may not be the killer himself...although the movie does move away from teh cliches at times and shows flashes of brilliance, it can't hold a candle to the wonderful film Seven.  First of all, the acting is too melodramatic; Carey Elwes and Danny Glover, among others, just seem flat and unconvincing at times.  The writer of the film, who felt the need to cast himself in one of the main roles, clearly needs a little more practice before he tackles another big part.  All in all, though, the movie zips along at a good pace and rates high on the \\"creepy\\" meter.  The plot twists and surprises are devious and hair-raising, and even if there are a few unanswered questions at the end of the film, Saw still provides a good scary thrill ride.
B000244FDW|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has been filmed three times: once in the early 1940s starring Greer Garson as Elizabeth Bennet, again in 1980 when it was presented by BBC as a five-part series on Masterpiece Theater, and finally in 1996, as a six-part series on the A&E channel. The second version is the least known, which is too bad, because it's definitely the best of the three.<br /><br />I was delighted when at long last they put the BBC version on DVD.  It was previously available as a two-set VHS, but with many scenes cut out of the original as it was presented on Masterpiece Theater.  The DVD restores the original in five parts.  If this does break up the continuity a bit, it also lets you watch it in increments if you don't want to view it all at once (at 4 and a half hours, it's a lengthy film), without missing anything.<br /><br />Most people who watched the A&E version of the book were drawn by the casting of Colin Firth in the role of Darcy. Let me say with some trepidation, lest I get jumped en masse and drawn and quartered by Firth groupies, that I thought he was miscast in that role. The BBC version had no big names, but the casting was almost perfect. Greer Garson in the role of Elizabeth Bennett in the Hollywood movie was ridiculous, a 36 year old actress playing a 20 year old ingenue; she should have been cast as Elizabeth's mother.  Jennifer Ehle in the role of Elizabeth in the A&E film was excellent. But whereas Ehle did a very fine job playing Elizabeth Bennet, Elizabeth Garvie, in the BBC version, WAS Elizabeth Bennet.<br /><br />Of all the three films made of the book, The BBC version stays closest to the book by far. The Hollywood film turned the book inside out until one almost couldn't tell what book the film was based on, and the A&E version, although it adhered fairly close to the book, took the liberty of rewriting some of Austen's famous lines. One does not rewrite Austen. Period.<br /><br />The cast of the BBC version is superb. Elizabeth Garvie is so much Elizabeth Bennet that she could have been invented for the part. She brings out all the character's lively intelligence, impulsiveness and spirit. She even looks like Elizabeth Bennet as Austen describes her, with her petite, slender frame and her enormous dark eyes. She brings the part so much to life that we imagine we are seeing her just as Austen meant her to be.<br /><br />David Rintoul as Darcy aroused some criticism among some viewers who complained that his portrayal of Darcy is \\"wooden\\". Well, let's face it, Darcy was wooden in the book. Did Darcy ever crack a smile except in the last two chapters? Firth wanted to create his own conception of Darcy; sensitive, vulnerable, very much a 90's Darcy. He did a convincing job of it; the only problem is, Firth's Darcy isn't Austen's Darcy. Darcy jumping into a lake?  Please.  Rintoul portrays Darcy just as Austen wrote him, and he certainly looks the part -- tall, dark, stunningly handsome, very much the rich arrogant snob asking for a comeuppance. The interplay between Garvie and Rintoul is delightful, much more so than Ehle and Firth. Garvie and Rintoul are more of a contrast, as Austen meant them to be; her sparkling wit and vivacity is set off by his steadiness and gravity. Two of the best scenes in the film are when Elizabeth refuses Darcy's proposal, and when they run into each other at Pemberley. When Elizabeth tells Darcy he's the last man in the world she could ever be prevailed on to marry, her eyes flash enough sparks to set him on fire. And at their meeting at Pemberley, their mutual confusion and embarrassment, as portrayed by Garvie and Rintoul, is priceless to behold.<br /><br />The other cast members look and act just as we picture them while reading the book. Mr. Bennet is a benevolent, impatient authority figure, his contempt for his wife's stupidity abundant in every line. Mrs. Bennet is a ditzy airhead, concerned only with gossip, the latest fashions, and marrying off her five daughters. The sisters all give competent performances but Sabina Franklyn is especially worth watching as the serenely beautiful Jane Bennet. The one disappointment was Lady Catherine DeBourgh. I had pictured her as a heavy-set Gorgon of a woman, and here she appears as a dried-up shrew, although she's evil enough. But Mr. Collins is dead-on perfect; a hilarious mixture of pomposity and servility. My favorite character of all in this production is Elizabeth's Aunt Gardiner as played by Barbara Shelley; her calm reassurance and common sense are exactly what Elizabeth needs to support her under her own confused feelings about Darcy, and when she is faced with the family crisis caused by Lydia's elopement with Wickham.<br /><br />Ably directed by Cyril Coke, this version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the one to watch.

6304806434|4.0|As big dumb action films go, it hardly gets bigger and dumber than this.  Yet \\"Con Air\\" is bursting at the seams with acting talent and a laugh-out-loud script so chock full of classic action film one-liners it makes this movie one of the most rapturous popcorn-munching guilty pleasures since \\"Point Break\\".  This is a movie that so gleefully revels in its shallowness and perfectly tuned to its adrenaline-craving audience, it can barely afford five minutes to spend on all of the necessary plot setup, dispensing of it easily before the title graphics even appear.  In that five minutes, we learn that Army Ranger Cameron Poe (a musclebound Nicholas Cage) has returned from a tour of duty to visit his lovely wife.  No sooner does he step off the plane and finish a line dance, then he gets into some trouble with some wound-up locals.  They fight, one pulls a knife, and Poe ends up killing him in self defense.  Whoops.  Well, the yokels make off with the knife and Poe gets railroaded into Arkansas federal prison, where he spends his days weaving in and out of Michael Bey-style quick edits, working furiously on his pecs and voice-over narrating sensitive letters to his yet unseen daughter in a ridiculously mannered southern drawl that sounds like Foghorn Leghorn on a morphine trip. After 8 years of prison workouts and bad hair days, Poe is finally on his way home to meet his daughter - that is, until his prison transfer plane is hijacked by the forces of evil.  And mayhem and madness ensues as all laws of sensible plot development are thrown out the window and action movie physics take over. <br /> <br />The ensemble all-star villains cast includes John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi as a Jeffrey Dahmer type, plus sturdy supporting roles for Dave Chappelle and Danny Trejo.  John Cusack and Colm Meaney have a grand time on the ground playing good cop/bad cop as they try to track the runaway jet, while Rachel Ticotin and Mykelti Williamson provide visual confirmation of Poe's conscience as well as distracting semi-perils that our hero must solve.   Director Simon West keeps the action flowing, synched perfectly to Trevor Rabin's noisy industrial-strength action film soundtrack, as Con Air careens from one implausibly over-the-top set piece to another.  This is the kind of movie that could *only* end up crashing a C-130 into the Las Vegas strip.  Are we surprised when the perfectly operational police bike crashes into the back of the firetruck and explodes instantly?  Or seeing an angry Poe taking a gunshot to the arm and not even flinch?  Or how about Malkovich somehow being able to surreptitiously construct an incindiary device in a maximum-security lockdown?  (Of course, i'd say the effete Malkovich has a better chance of the latter, as opposed to giving an freakishly amped-up Cage a good match in a fist fight on a runaway firetruck.) <br /> <br />It always amuses me when sensible people - would-be critic and audient alike - log on to try to throw the believability gauntlet at a hilariously grand spectacle like this.  Is it seriously worth wasting your time expressing indignance about your cinematic sensibilities being ruffled by a Simpson/Bruckheimer production?   Were you expecting Simon West to squeeze out a mini-\\"Citizen Kane\\" before he got to work on \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\"?  ADMIT that you have been entertained.  And put the bunny down.
0316172324|5.0|I'd seen Mr. Gladwell's interviews on television about his book several months ago. So when I saw the title sitting on the shelf at the library my thinslicer nearly snapped my elbow in two to take it home.  <br /> <br />This is literally the most interesting book that I've read in years. Mr. Gladwell doesn't try to convince you that your brain is too sophisticated to ever be doubted. He doesn't try to tell you that it's so fallible that you ought to run a mathmatical diagram to back yourself up, either. He gives you a look at the different ways that the \\"snap judgements\\" work for us and against us. <br /> <br />I had an instance several years ago, after my sister in law had died in a car accident, that made perfect sense after reading this book. I'd halfway thought I'd had some sort of \\"psychic\\" interlude or a \\"God had touched my heart\\" thing, which I'm in no way inclined towards. My brothers wife had died about 6 months before this. He and I were in our respective vehicles. I was driving towards him on the road that we live on. A two lane road that we passed each other on many times. As I passed him, keep in mind this was at 35-40 mph, there was something about the position of his head that it immeditately went through my mind that something was very wrong. I didn't get a look at his face. I was driving and just took a glance after recognizing his truck. I turned around in a parking lot and followed him home. He was so overwhelmed by grief that day that he was honestly a hairs breadth from a complete emotional nervous breakdown. This man is one of the strongest, most resilient man I know, but his wife's death was about to send him over the edge. I spent the rest of the afternoon with him. Letting him talk, and listening to him tell me about her. By the end of the day he had come down off of that terrible place and he's moved on in life.  <br /> <br />This book made me finally realize what that split second glance had been for me. Not that I'm an expert on my brother. Not that if I were to see that exact same situation in a rank stranger that I'd have the same reaction... just that my mind took the scene and broke it down and put it back together in a frame of time that is absolutely infinitesimal, and gave it back to me in a quick \\"hunch\\" to tell me that something was wrong with my brother. <br /> <br />Mr. Gladwell isn't trying to sell you on this. Merely to highlight it and help you to look at why things happen in life and marvel over what a amazing machine we all have in our grasp. <br /> <br />There's a quote that I believe is by Zig Ziggler? Which goes along the lines of... \\"Information can circle the world in a second and take 20 years to penetrate that quarter inch of space between my ear and my brain\\". Don't let that happen to you.

0385334206|4.0|It was a quick read.

B00028HBKM|2.0|It is hard to fathom the idea that the story of the crucifixion could be made in a way in which the violence feels gratuitous, but Mel Gibson seems to have managed this difficult task.  Instead of feeling inspired or touched or moved to compassion, I was left feeling numb.  I was open to a more positive experience of the film, notwithstanding the inherent violence of the story. <br />Whatever artistic or spiritual goals may have been intended by the writers and director, they were lost for me in the violence that appeared, as the film progressed, to be the the main objective.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|\\"Can you feel it?\\" is my fave Jackson song of all time cos it reminds me of my youth. But it's not on this compilation, hence giving it four stars. Also missing is \\"I'll be there\\" - another fave. Overall, this disc is a very good representation of MJ's music over the last 30 years.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|With 'This Year's Girl,'  Elvis Costello takes the 3 minute pop song and makes it into an art form.  Nothing about the album is revolutionary on the surface, but each song is dexterous and complex within its own simplistic framework.  The melodies never feel calculated or mechanical despite how expertly they are crafted.  Each note that Costello sings seems like the natural progression from the previous note. Track 7, \\"Hand in Hand\\" is a particularly good example of Costello's fluidity as a songwriter.  There was a time where I literally listened to this song on repeat over and over.  \\"You Belong To Me\\" and \\"This Year's Girl\\" are sugary pop on the surface, but over repeated listens, they're marked by an incredible attention to melodic detail.   <br /> <br />The lyrics are witty and thematically hit upon the notion of fleeting coolness.  Costello seems jaded by how hipness corrupts. He cynically sings about Chelsea, radio, and \\"paradise\\" and the sad notion that love is as vapid and fleeting as the culture of models or celebrity.  Costello's raspy but superbly endearing voice convey this edginess and disenchantment without coming across as pretentious.  It's interesting that this album still seems so hip because, at least I interpret it, it is an indictment of hipness.   <br /> <br />The production is pitch-perfect.  It was released in 1978, but it could have been released yesterday.  That's how fresh this album is.  The harmonies are there, but they're not syrupy.  And the band: the Attractions brings an energy and musicianship that is uncharacteristic to an album that is so songwriting-focused.  \\"(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea\\" has one of the best and most driving drumbeats in a pop song.  So does \\"No Action,\\" the album's fantastic opener.  The keyboard work throughout is also stellar, though it may take a little while to get used to that cheesy organ sound.  <br /> <br />This Year's Model is definitely one of the best albums, the more endearing because of its outward simplicity and accessibility.  It is a work of craft, sincerity, and vision.  I love it.

Once I started this book, I could not put it down.  I particularly enjoyed \\"What You Should Have Learned in This Chapter\\" at the end of each Chapter.  It really drilled the information into my head!  Also, I saw myself in some of scenarios (yikes), and I now vow to never let that happen again!  Thanks Greg and Liz for a truly great book that needed to be written.  We all need to tell every single woman we know about this book!
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|*** couple of mild spoilers *** <br /> <br />I genuinely enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so of Gothika. The theme of the psychiatrist's (competently if never entirely convincingly played by Halle Berry) world turning on its head in horrible fashion, was a compelling one and I was really looking forward to a taut psychological thriller.  Instead, soon thereafter, the movie plummets disappointingly into formulaic and derivative grand guignol.  I mean, how many times have us horror buffs seen the tired old it's behiiiiind you or the something-scary-in-the-swimming-pool routine?   Irritatingly over-gratuitous use of strobe lighting also makes Gothika uncomfortable viewing for all the wrong reasons.  <br /> <br />Hat-tips to (or rip-offs from, depending on how generous you feel) other movies are plentiful, and I was reminded of Suspiria, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dead and Buried, 6th Sense, Stir of Echoes, and probably dozens more. <br /> <br />Most on-the-ball viewers will guess whodunit well before the predictable and anti-climactic ending. <br /> <br />Gothika is just saved from being a lone-star movie by the promising beginning, decent soundtrack and Penelope Cruz's excellent depiction of a profoundly troubled mind. <br /> <br />On the whole though, this is yet another disappointing offering from the Dark Castle label.  <br />
B00025ETIW|2.0|My friend ranted and raved about this amazing original band, My Chemical Romance, so I picked up the CD. I was appaled. The lyrics are stupid and depressingly morbid. While listening, I had the urge that I wanted to like these guys, but they were just too boring and relentless. Also, this band WAY overuses the \\"f\\" word. If there's no need for it (when is there?), why use it?  <br /> <br />The ONLY reason I gave this CD two stars instead of 1 is because the first track \\"Helena\\" I actually did enjoy (and the video is STELLAR)...but one out of thirteen is a HORRIBLE fraction... It seems that these guys may have talent, but they are way overridden with depression and the cliches of emo music: you can sell records without stooping down to curse words and songs filled with death. <br /> <br />and for everyone's claims of originality? Um...ever heard of THE USED! My Chemical Romance is just a re-hashed version of the great band The Used. And, as always, re-hashed material is never as fun, vibrant, or enjoyable. <br /> <br />And all the make-up and black hair dye? I think it's simply distubring. <br /> <br />Well, that's my take on the worst CD of the year. <br />How about \\"Three Cheers for My Money Back\\"? <br /> <br />If you enjoyed the auror My Chemical Romance slightly emits, try the first CD by The Used (it's self-titled)... The Used is DEFINATLEY the band that would be attriubeted to My Chemcial Romance's \\"source material\\"
0060005688|5.0|This is a great book.  Barry Schwartz attempts to destroy one of our society's sacred cows: The more choices we have, the better off we are.  Not so, according to Schwartz.  His thesis is that choice is good, and better than having no choice, but at a certain critical point, too much choice can have a net negative effect on our health and psychological well-being.  From the mere fact that choice is good, it does not follow, according to Schwartz that more is necessarily better.  But what about our central American value-freedom!  Schwartz has a response.  He says it is a mistake to equate liberty too directly with choice. In fact, he says that too many choices will place a burden on our psychological sense of freedom. <br /> <br />The following prescriptions follow from his thesis: <br /> <br />1. We would be better off if we embraced voluntary restrictions on our freedom of choice. <br /> <br />2. We should look for what is \\"good enough\\" rather than \\"the best\\". <br /> <br />3. We should lower our expectations about the results of our decisions. <br /> <br />4. We should make nonreversible decisions. <br /> <br />5. We should pay less attention to what others are doing. <br /> <br />After introducing his thesis, Schwartz spends the next 40 pages or so making the case that as our civilization has progressed, we've had vast increases in our options in most areas of our lives, and that the cumulative effect of these increases has had a deleterious effect on our lives.  This is the worst part of the book, as I feel he could have reduced this part to half its length.  Most of us, upon a moment's reflection, don't need 40 pages to be convinced that we have more choices than ever before.  Nevertheless, the book gets better from there. <br /> <br />We have, according to the author, three kinds of utility: experienced utility, remembered utility, and expected utility.  If we are to know what we really want, we must have knowledge of all three, and they should each be alignedwith one another.  But there is a problem, for remembered utility is heavily biased toward remembering the peak feeling of an experience and how it ended to the exclusion of all other factors. This is called the \\"peak-end\\" rule.  Schwartz also provides us with studies to demonstrate that our predictions-- our expected utility-- are not accurate to how we actually will feel (i.e., our experienced utility).  And our foundations for present decisions are memory and expectation. But since neither memory nor expectation are accurate, we have an obvious problem in the decision making process.   We also have biases to certain types of information.  For example, we rate familiar things higher than unfamiliar things, even if our familiarity has come from only advertising.  We are susceptible to anecdotal evidence, especially of the vivid variety, compared to large data sets that contradict the anecdote.     We use what's called the \\"availability heuristic\\", which means we assume that the easier something is to recall, the more we assume we've encountered it.  But salience counts too, and advertisers and the media take full advantage of this fact. <br /> <br />From here, we learn that people are risk averse when it comes to choices that may result in gain, but when it comes to choices that may result in loss, we are more willing to take a chance to prevent the negative feelings associated with that loss.  This is all borne out in the studies Schwartz cites.  We also learn that people value things they consider theirs, and are unwilling, in most cases, to trade up.  Presumably, this is because trading entails both a loss and a gain, but since losses weigh heavier in our minds than gains, we are hesitant to trade.  When you consider that we have more choices to select from, and add to this that losses are subjectively considered heavier than gains are, we have an increased burden when it comes to decision-making.  Look at all you're giving up in selecting option x! <br /> <br/>Another theme that runs thought he book is the distinction between two types of people:  maximizers and saticficers.  Maximizers are obsessed with choosing \\"the best\\" while satisficers are happy choosing what is \\"good enough\\".  Schwartz recommends that, in an age of nearly unlimited choices, we would do ourselves well to become satisficers. To be a maximizer today is to fill a prescription for anxiety, regret, unhappiness, and second-guessing. He supports this by citing studies that correlated maximizing with having less satisfaction with life, unhappiness, lack of optimism, increased regret, and depression.  Schwartz goes out of his way to make clear the distinction between objective results and subjective results with respect to our decisions. Maximizers may do better objectively (e.g., get a cheaper price on a suit), while satisfiers do better subjectively (i.e., are happier with their decision).  So who's really maximizing? <br /> <br />Schwartz also explores Martin Seligman's \\"Learned Helplessness\\" hypothesis and how we are to reconcile the paradoxical situation of having increased choice, and so increased control, with the empirical fact that people's mental health are not improving as a result.  He finds his answer in increased societal expectations and increased individualism which both can lead to self-blame.  <br /> <br />I do have disagreement with Schwartz on some minor points.  He points out that people underestimate certain causes of death while overestimating others.  His explanation: The media.  But he doesn't consider the fact that the causes we overestimate are the same causes of death that we had to deal with most often in out evolutionary history.  We overestimate homicide and underestimate strokes because homicide was a serious problem (and the data supports this) whereas strokes weren't.  We didn't live long enough for strokes to become a problem to be dealt with like homicide would've.  So our minds are acutely aware of homicide, so we overestimate its pervasiveness.    <br /> <br />He also says that the constraints on other organism's choices come from biology, but with humans these constraints  \\"have to come from culture\\".  He says these biological restraints help animals recognize \\"food, mates, predators, and other dangers.\\"   Is he really denying that biology plays a role in our choice restraints and recognition of \\"food, mates, predators, and other dangers\\"?   To affirm this is to be ignorant of psychology (Schwartz's field) of the last 20 years or so. <br /> <br />I commend Schwartz for remaining apolitical in the book.  That was nice. I kept waiting for him to start making anti-free market policy prescriptions, but he didn't.  One does, however, wonder if Schwartz would be supportive of a brand of political conservatism (I'm sure he wouldn't appreciate this claim).  For example, he says of satisficers, who are his models for human choice-making, \\"... a satisfier is not likely to be thinking about a hypothetical perfect world, in which options exist that contain all things they value and trade-offs unnecessary.\\"  Wow!  It doesn't take much extrapolation to see the consequence of such a view.  The word \\"saticficer\\" could've easily been replaced the word \\"conservative\\" and that sentence would have been just as true. But I digress... <br /> <br />When it's all said and done, this book remains loyal to the empirical data, is air-tightly reasoned, and revolutionary its conclusions.  This book will change the way you think.  Know thyself.   <br />
B000002GQJ|5.0|From the moment your ears are assailed by the furious strumming and explosive keyboards of \\"Question\\" you suspect that you are in for one hell of a trip...and this album does not disappoint. because the Moodies during this period were tremendously creative and adventurous you do not encounter consistency - on this or any of their great sequence of concept albums. At times, they provoke winces, at other times awe - often within seconds. But they are as always saved by consummate musicianship and their tremendous gift for invention.  <br />All this is in evidence on \\"A Question of Balance\\". <br />The opening track is magnificent - furious and tender by turns. There is a very human rage - and mystification - in evidence here, that is, seemingly, redeemed by the gentle (and superbly evocative) middle section. Justin Hayward's voice seems inflected by a soul sensibility here, and is very moving. <br />The next three tracks maintain the fever pitch of question. \\"How Is It We Are Here?\\" is brilliant. Mike Pinder is scathing in his criticism of technocracy, and the music is great! Hayward's guitar solo, Graeme Edge's delicate touches on the drums and the deep wash of Pinder's Mellotron create a wonderful soundscape. <br />\\"And The Tide Rushes In\\" is another masterpiece - Ray Thomas' voice is at its most appealing, and the music is light and subtle. There is at times a haiku-like clarity with the Moodies - an air of eternity compressed into one lambent statement - and Justin Hayward's quiet guitar phrases here are evidence of that. <br />\\"Don't You Feel Small?\\" is Graeme Edge at his quirky and perceptive best, and the song is haunting - a little menacing in parts where a breathy voice whispers the lyrics in counterpoint to the melody. <br />Things wind down a bit after this superb opening, although \\"Its Up To You\\" and \\"Minstrel's Song\\" are great to sing along with. Pinder's \\"Melancholy Man\\", although repetitive, is superbly evocative, and hints at the power Pinder later revealed on \\"My Song\\" (from EGBDF). <br />\\"The Balance\\" is a cheerful corrective to \\"Melancholy Man\\", with a parable-feel and a gospelesque chorus. <br />All-in-all a fine album, but of the \\"classic seven\\", I rate it about 4th. In fact, if I had to order them, I'd place them thus: <br /> <br />1. TO OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN'S CHILDREN <br />2. EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES FAVOUR <br />3. ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM <br />4. A QUESTION OF BALANCE <br />5. IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD <br />6. SEVENTH SOJOURN <br />7. DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED <br /> <br />happy listening, folks

B0006284JQ|5.0|all the hits by one of music's most entertaning stars of the pop era. this album contains many great tracks. my favorite has got to be \\"sometimes\\", but \\"not at girl not yet a woamn\\" and of course\\"baby one more time\\" are also classics. This album is a must for lovers of real pop music.
B0000085N4|5.0|\\"Sonic Temple\\" is different than anything The Cult made before or after. Their previous albums sounded like AC/DC, \\"Ceremony\\" was a HUGE disappointment, and \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" sounded like \\"Purple\\" era STP. I don't like any of their other albums, although \\"BGAE\\" is decent, yet I consider this one of the best albums of the 80's. There really aren't any filler or even weak songs on here. The style is sort of a gray area between hard rock and metal. In my previous reviews, I have named certain albums \\"Heirs to the Metallica throne.\\" Well here I am declaring this an \\"Heir to the Led Zeppelin throne.\\" Both bands embrace the same values when recording a song (it's always a plus when the majority of songs are over five minutes), and they sound somewhat similar too, all the way down to the Les Paul guitars. A fantastic album that should be in any classic or hard rock fans library.
0156027321|2.0|First things first.  Yann Martel (the author) admitted that he took the general premise (kid in boat with exotic cat) for this book from another one, published in 1981, Schliar's \\"Max and the Cats.\\"  So, the ideas for this novel aren't as original as some people may believe.<br /><br />Sure, it's a great survival story.  I was amazed by the kid's creativity when it came to training the tiger and eating (being able to catch fish, for example).  And the courage he displays while alone in the middle of the ocean is tremendous.<br /><br />I read this book mainly because I had heard a lot of talk about it and my department had chosen it as a summer read for our students.  After the first 150 pages or so, I put the book down and let it sit around for a month before I touched it again.  The beginning of this book, while giving the background on the characters, also spouted a LOT of religion.  I ended up skipping about 20 pages of religious banter before I continued  with the story.<br /><br />The first few pages of the shipwreck scenes are GREAT in this book.  Especially when Pi is calling to Richard Parker.  That, arguably, is the BEST scene in the whole book (and one that I will definitely look at in the classroom).  After that, however, you have another hundred or so pages of \\"I am sitting in a boat with a tiger that could kill me at any minute,\\" and that gets really old, really fast.<br /><br />Some reviewers have said that they really liked the ending to this book and I have to say, I was disappointed when I was finished.  Why did I waste my time? I kept asking myself.  I know the real reasons: I am a teacher and knew I'd have to teach this book.  Also, I was hoping this book would get better.  If some pieces of this book were not as drawn-out, this would be a GREAT book.  However, I thought parts of it were just too wordy and boring to give it two thumbs up.
B000002G7E|5.0|I don't have much to add to what the other people here have said except that if you really want to listen to this album, get the remastered version so you can actually hear all the nuances and lyrics.  I was worried it might lose something if cleaned up, but apparently it was so poorly produced in the first place that it's still very grimy, and all the better for it. <br /> <br />One note about Sister Ray, the 17 1/2 minute long closer...it seems to go on forever, but if you let yourself get lost in it, you will be sad when it finally ends and want to listen to it again.  Swear to God.
0596009208|4.0|I started reading this book about a week ago and am at chapter 9 now and still going.  This book is great, super, well written.  Plenty of funny illustrations to help the reader understand some complex topics.  Covers a whole lot on object oriented programming and java (duh).  My only problem with this book are the exercises at the end of the chapters. They are just too short and don;t help very much.  I feel that the reader needs a lot more problems to work on, preferably ones in which he/she writes his/her own code.  I have found that to be very helpful in previous C++ and UNIX textbooks.  This is actually my only complaint, other than that i would highly recommend it but also recommend another book with more code as you will be done with this farily quickly (a good thing, they meke everything so understandable).  Hope this helped.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|New Orleans is where I met the man on the cd and what a charmer he is. After the show he signed autographs at his bus and he looked a little tired, but then after the performance he put on it's no small wonder. He not only sings so well, dances, and the show was hilarious as he clowns around, tells good jokes and involves the audience. Yes, he does it all and does it all well. My husband says he's much like a cross between Dean Martin & Bobby Darin on stage - that's high praise from my hubby. <br />  <br />Sitting on one side of me was a lady with her husband and their teenage grandchildren and on the other side a group of 20 something very attractive young ladies. Such diversity and so nice to see people of all ages and stripes finding this guy's music as their common denominator. My husband and I have his earlier album and find that this one is just that much better, perhaps because of the song he and his pianist A. Chang wrote together called Home. Home will etch itself into your memory if you hear it just once and you will take it with you wherever you go, I know that's what we found. Take care of yourself Mr. Buble, we want and need you to keep entertaining us with your style, grace, charm and talent for a long, long time!
B00004TEUX|3.0|In my opinion this recording of Mendelssohn's Scottish Symphony is very good except that the timpani part is almost inaudible.  The timpani are important in this symphony; they reinforce the sound at crucial moments.  I know what the symphony should sound like, and at those many moments in this recording I have to use my imagination.  That is a shame.  It is the only thing that keeps this performance from being marvelous.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|I was first introduced to SS thru Seven Swans, which I instantly loved. I knew this was a somewhat departure for him and wasn't expecting a repeat with Illinois, but I nevertheless was expecting a stellar album. It hits amazingly high notes at times, but it simply isn't 5 star material. I am all for a unique, unexpected, creative approach to music, which Sufjan obviously takes. But for me, it's basic music criticisms I have with Illinoise- too many of the songs meander into 'boring' territory due to length and too many sound alike. Stevens is obviously a huge talent and I'm sure he will put out his masterpiece one day- this, for me, is not it. <br /> <br />Highlights: <br /> <br />Concering the UFO Sighting <br />Black Hawk War <br />Illinoise (without a doubt the highlight of the album) <br />John Wayne Gacy <br />Man of Metropolis
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is great. It has the best of coldplay, and the first 5 songs on this album are the songs that will always keep them making good music and will make their popularity huge forever.
B0009MAP90|4.0|A younger than seems possible Bob Dylan stares at us from the cover of his very first album. The year was 1962. Inside the CD booklet, the pictures reveal a slightly awkward looking Dylan who doesn't quite exude the confidence that inexorably burgeoned approximately a year later (compare these photos with the photos included in the remasters of \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" and \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\"). And who can blame him for possibly feeling a little out of place? The great John Hammond had just discovered him playing in clubs such as the Gaslight in Greenwich Village (Hammond also discovered such indispensable names as Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, and others). Suddenly (he left Minnesota for New York around 1959) Dylan finds himself in a Columbia records recording studio. Not only that, he's recording two of his own compositions.<br /><br />Though the young Dylan might look a little awkward here, he by no means sounds awkward. The now 42 year old pictures belie the extreme confidence and \\"wise beyond his years\\" mood that pervades his first album. Dylan was only 20 at the time. Nonetheless, the songs about death and sorrow carry a mood of experience and feeling that most 20 year olds probably can't imagine. Dylan grunts and strains in \\"In My Time of Dying\\" (a traditional blues number sometimes attributed to Blind Willie Johnson and sometimes credited as just 'traditional') and \\"Fixin' To Die\\" (by \\"Bukka\\" White - another blues singer that lived the blues) as though the issue has direct immediacy for him. And the great closer \\"See that my Grave Is Kept Clean\\" (by the legendary Blind Lemon Jefferson - another man who lived the blues) carries a similar impact. At times, Dylan's voice takes on a harsher growl here than on any of his subsequent albums (listen to the songs above as well as \\"Highway 51 Blues\\", \\"Gospel Plow\\", and \\"House of the Risin' Sun\\" for more examples). Songs such as \\"Talkin' New York\\" - the album's funniest song with original lyrics by Dylan - and \\"Baby, Let Me Follow You Down\\" point to the Dylan that emerges on 1963's \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\". Dylan began to evolve even on his first album.<br /><br />The Dylan original, \\"Song To Woody\\", shows Dylan's great promise as a songwriter, but it does pale a little in comparison to his output of 1963. In fact, very little on this album, great as it is, points to the Dylan that we know over 40 years later as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Had Dylan ceased recording after this album he would've remained an interesting, and probably obscure, footnote in folk music history. Had he stopped recording after \\"Freewheelin'\\" he would probably still be remembered as somewhat of a legend. In fact, the transition from this album to its successor is startling and shows an evolution and progression probably unmatched in popular music history. In his \\"Chronicles, Vol. 1\\" Dylan even expressed some surprise at what happened. At the time he said the only thing of any significance he had written was \\"Song To Woody\\". That soon changed.<br /><br />Dylan's first album is a great listen. The long overdue remastering sounds incredible. It has also likely exposed many people to great blues and folk classics. It probably also fueled the young Dylan with the confidence and assurance to go on to write timeless songs such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\", \\"Masters of War\\", and \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\". This album exposes Dylan's roots, and provides a fascinating document of where he came from and, subsequently, what he became.funniest song with original lyrics by Dylan - and \\"Baby, Let Me Follow You Down\\" point to the Dylan that emerges on 1963's \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\".

B0002CHIJW|4.0|A very twisted movie (for a seventies flick).  Especially that scene in the bath-tub.  Ick.   I suppose that they deserved it, though, eh?  Moral:  don't rape retarded women in the woods!
0345475674|4.0|I have to confess : I am a Robert Harris fan. He writes about times and places with the self confidence of a guide who was there when the story took place. All his books are well researched and POMPEII is no exception. It is a Greek tragedy with a twist : we think that we know the end - but we are kept in suspense until the last page delivers a new hope. <br /> <br />There is no doubt that Robert Harris is in a class with James A. Michener and I hope that his next book will take us to some other exciting periods in human history: Carthagena ? Cronwell's England ? Vatican ?
0393317552|3.0|... unfortunately all three of the books are on the same topic and say the same things and are mixed together randomly.  There is so much repetition and redundancy in this book that a good editor could have cut more than half of the words and still all of Diamond's points would have been made (albeit only once per point).  If you value your time it might be better to watch the TV show.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|You may disagree with me, but 'Team America -- World Police' is NOT the best thing Trey Parker/Matt Stone have ever created.  It is still Eric Cartman, or any characters in 'South Park' which should be called their best, but, well, like most reviewers before, I find 'Team America - World Police' mostly funny.   <br /> <br />I said, 'mostly,' for some parts are definitely unfunny, but I'll talk about it later.  Inspired by a UK cult TV show 'Thunderbird' made in the 60s, the self-appointed marionett rescue team save the world from the terroists.  Of course, that's a satire, and the target is the current US policy, but Trey Parker doesn't stop there. <br /> <br />[MAKING FOOL OF ... EVERYTHING]  Yes, don't think about the politics.  Michael Moore (I mean his lookalike puppet) appears, but the purpose of his inclusion here is, it seems, not political but very personal, as if Trey Parker (who was briefly in 'Bowling for Columbine') has some grudges against him. <br /> <br />Anyway, 'Team America' makes fool of the right, the left, or everything it thinks deserves bashing.  The film's story itself is mocking Jerry Bruckheimer films, in which an all-American boy is made an all-American hero after many struggles (read actions) and some pains (read booze) before he gains the big prize (read love, or a chick).  Which means the film includes a 'love scene' of the marionetts, of which reality would be embarrassing to some.  And you can hear a song stating the quality of one Micheal Bay film and the acting abilities of Ben and Cuba. <br /> <br />[HOLLYWOOD STARS] And what is most daring (and outrageous) is the special appearances of the Hollywood celebrities, who are, according to the film, too politically aggressive.  It's easy to imagine that Trey Parker doesn't like those actors who express their views on politics in the programs like 'Crossfire' or the magazines like 'Rollingstone.'  Unfortunately, however, this is the least satisfying part for me, because, quite frankly, these marionetts just don't look like the real counterparts.  Alec Baldwin looks more like his brother Daniel, and other lookalike puppets are no better.  (Interestingly, George Clooney's puppet appears, but he receives comparatively better treatment among the final action scene, in which those \\"celebrities\\" turn baddies and meet nasty fate.  And Clooney is a known 'South Park' fan, and appeared there.  Maybe Trey Parker didn't bring himself to treat him bad, even a puppet.)  <br /> <br />Technically, however, the marionettes of the main characters  are fantastic (especially those of 'Lisa' and 'Gary'), with their subtle facial expressions which look often so uncannily real.  And also very impressive is the national leader of North Korea, where this film would be banned forever with good reasons. <br /> <br />I enjoyed watching 'Team America' though it often goes too far, and still I like 'South Park' better, both TV series or the filmed version.  And surely 'Team America' has political aspects, but you don't have to offended with them.  It's just a comedy -- a comedy to which nothing is sacred.  Enjoy it as such if you can.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|...is what I say.Would he find yet one more reason to eschew Westernization? Would he even understand the type of brain damage it takes to make something like this? Team America is a failure, more or less, but how do you top the South Park movie in terms of grossing out, offending your audience and having time to satirize everything under the sun in between? Simple. You have marionettes...wait,I don't think I can get away with mentioning what Parker and Stone do with them here. You just won't believe it. You could skip this one, in all honesty, but you won't be angry if you do buy it.
B0000844IT|4.0|In case you don't know, Captain Super Market is the name of the superior Japanese release of the film. <br /> <br />Anyhow, this movie is pretty good. It wasn't exactly the Lovecraftian Evil Dead I grew up with. Obviously, the producers involved in this one, did not hand much money over to Sam for this one, and I'm sure Sam (being the non-conservative that he is) took the liberty to transform the Evil Dead franchise into something almost detatched from its predacessors. <br /> <br />For one thing, this movie is NOT scary in any way. I don't even see how a child could scare of this movie much at all. Perhaps with the beginning scene, and later with a possessed old lady scene, but other than that, NOTHING! It's pure slapstick comedy, with a major tribute played to classic 60's stop movion fantasy films, and at this, it does a great job! <br /> Now what blows for me, is the fact that they stripped it of it's Lovecraftian roots: Murder, Mayham, un-describable monstrosities from beyond, madness, posession, extreme bodily mutilation, VERY INTERESTING STORY and BACKSTORY (check out Evil Dead comics),etc. Removed the scene I read about in Fangoria where Bruce (don't call me Ash) Campbell was supposed to be enter the temple of the witch that posessed was in the body of the lady in the cellar in Part 2, where in, he would face off with the original incarnation of that witch. Sounds awsome, but did it ever show up in the movie? NO! :/ <br /> Infact, Sam even changed how 2 ends. WTF!?! <br /> Another sad thing in the theatre was the fact that in America, we got the VERY non-Lovecraftian, but VERY Amerikkkan ending which was very amusing, but not Evil Dead once again. The alternate ending was exactly right on, and would server as an interesting base for Evil Dead 4. <br /> <br />
0975991477|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, especially the first few chapters.  The author does a good job of explaining cell biology and makes a compelling argument that the cell membrane is the functional equivalent to the brain in multi-cellular entities.  He cites fascinating evidence to demonstrate the importance of belief in our health and psychological well-being.  However, I expected some practical advice on how to apply this knowledge to my own personal experience and I was somewhat disappointed.  There is a very good chapter regarding the ways parents can have a positive impact on the development of their children, starting as early as conception, but that is essentially the final chapter and I was left wondering how to apply this information outside the parenting arena.  This complaint aside, the book is well documented and has some very interesting things to say about the pharmaceutical industry and health care in general.  I consider it a very good investment of my reading time, but I hoped for more.

B0000062GE|5.0|What SW did with this album is rare in today's musical landscape.  An \\"Industrial Band\\" putting together a workable concept album sounded about as obsurd in 1998 as Green Day putting together one in 2004. But with the pissed off premise of Ungod (their best album in my opinon,) and self pity of WBB&P behind them, Chris and the boys did just that.  Besides \\"Save Yourself\\", you cannot listen to this album in little pieces....you won't appreciate it.  The wave of emotion that encompases the album must be taken in as a whole.  How else can you fully grasp to it's fullest a song like \\"Waking Up Beside You\\"? (You must get your hands on the remix version of this song!!)  Some people have critisized the lyrics and writing, but SW knew what they were doing when they wrote this.  This is so much more accessible to people in the real world than an classic like Pink Floyd's Wall album.  I've searched, and I cannot find a better album to listen to when so pissed off at the woman in my life, I think in drastic measures.  Blasting the album and trying my best to \\"scream\\" along with Chris' wonderful vocals eventually gives way to the last song, which makes me come back down to earth.  With \\"Waking Up Beside You\\", I could tell that after all was said and done, a drastic decision could haunt you forever.  It makes you appreciate what you have and realize that if you have someone in your life that has flaws but is fighting the fight with you, you are lucky.  You don't need to be like the character in this album if it isn't too late.  We all have flaws, and when it is realized at the end of this album, the feeling of regret motivates you to keep on trying, so you are not left alone when it's too late.  In your search for perfection, you will not be able to \\"Save Yourself\\" without compromise.  As dark as this album is, the music motivates you to make sure you don't repeat the mistakes of others.  Stabbing Westward would never be able to achieve the minor commercial success of this album again, and despite excellent songs such as \\"Wasted\\" on their next, smaller label release, you knew the end was coming.  \\"Darkest Day's\\" was a snapshot of a band at their creative peak and certainly remains a gem of late 90's rock.again, and despite excellent songs such as \\"Wasted\\" on their next, smaller label release, you knew the end was coming.  \\"Darkest Day's\\" was a snapshot of a band at their creative peak and certainly remains a gem of late 90's rock.

B00005JNJT|3.0|One of the inevitable things about summer, ever since \\"Spider-Man\\" surprised us all in 2002, is that movie studios rummage through their license bins and ask themselves: \\"What comic book hero haven't we made a film about for a while?\\"  Apparently, Warner Brothers asked themselves this question and decided to dust off the venerable Batman franchise and slap another superhero film on our cinema screens.<br /><br /> \\"Batman Begins\\" is the latest in a long line of comic book movie adaptations in the last three years.  As usual, it focuses on the origins of the caped crusader, while trying to show every icon of the series that it can.<br /><br /> The story is familiar to anyone remotely aware of the character:  Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) witnessed his wealthy parents' murder as a small child and vowed to rid the world of evil by any means necessary.  And he has plenty of means, what with inheriting his parents' immense fortune.  But this movie shows that Bruce did more than just buy a fancy outfit and a really cool car and call himself Batman (though, for some reason, he believes he needs to talk in a laughably deep and threatening voice).<br /><br /> The opening of the film shows Bruce's training with the League of Shadows, a brutal ninja group obsessed with destroying evil and corruption at all costs.  But they prove to be too intense even for Bruce, so he abandons his training, and returns to Gotham, which anybody with more than ten brain cells can tell is New York City.  Once back home, he begins fighting the crime that runs rampant in the city, and must prevent Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy; playing the obligatory creepy supervillain) from contaminating the entire city with a panic-inducing toxin; Terrorism in its most literal sense.<br /><br /> One of the things this movie has going for it is a strong supporting cast.  When the likes of Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman populate a comic book movie, it's time to pay attention.  Neeson is excellent as always, as Ducard, who trains Bruce during his exile.<br /><br /> Ironically, the beginning of \\"Batman Begins\\" is the most interesting part.  There is real drama here, and I was prepared for more than just the average superhero movie.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what this film turned into by the end: Another average superhero movie.<br /><br /> My biggest gripe with this film, however, is that it is far, far too dark.  Yes, I am aware that I highly praised \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" for its darkness, but that was dramatic, rather than merely brutal.  \\"Sith\\" was sobering and touching, while \\"Batman\\" just makes you cringe.  I am also aware that the Batman comics have always been very dark, but then, I never said I liked the Batman comics, did I?<br /><br /> If you are a fan of the Batman franchise, this film will certainly please, with the origins of all the iconic Batman things: The mask, the Batmobile, the spotlight, and the utility belt with its amazing storage capabilities.  But for the casual movie-goer, this film may prove to be simply too much.s excellent as always, as Ducard, who trains Bruce during his exile. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the beginning of \\"Batman Begins\\" is the most interesting part.

B00005JMK0|5.0|This beautiful film pits man vs. machine. In this case, the machine is a computer. Not an ordinary computer though. Said computer falls in love with it's hapless owner - a good-looking, though naive man, who talks to his beloved electronic companion as if it were human. The computer quickly acquires human emotions such as love and jealousy. A new neighbor, very well played by a very very pretty Virginia Madsen, grows to like her new neighbor. She is a well known cello player who loves to play the love game; the chase, the clever, the apparent devotion. When the computer learns that love is in the air, that its lover has eyes for the girl next door, it becomes insanely jealous and uses every bit of it's bytes to sabotage the blossoming relationship. For example, he asks his neighbor to see a show with him, and she accepts. The computer figures out he is going on a date with it's competitor, and destroys the evening by canceling all his credit cards. I think this is all that need be said. Very witty romantic comedy that is over-looked by critics, movie channels, etc. Though dated (1985), it remains sophisticated enough to turn some veiwers away. Too bad. So it occupies cult status....and thats OK. It is simply adorable. A final thought, this film has a soundtrack that is nearly unbelieveable. The music is led by genius Georgio Moroder, and features an incredible cast of singers, songwriters, and musicians. Where oh where is the DVD? The soundtrack has been available for ages. Get it while you still can.
B00005JNSK|4.0|Sometimes movies surprise you.  For some reason, every time Johnny Depp is in a movie, it's one of those surprising ones, at least for me.  I thought \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" was going to flop (A movie based on a ride?  C'mon!), but we all know how successful that was.  And I thought \\"Secret Window\\" would be a tense thriller, but it turned out to be a predictable snoozer.  And once again, Johnny Depp has surprised me:  starring in a not-too-shabby film version of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", not to be confused with the 1971 musical film \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\".  Same story, but an utterly different experience. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film is directed by Tim Burton, known for darker, edgier films, which is just fine because the original book, written by Roald Dahl (also known for \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" and \\"Matilda\\") is dark and edgy too, at least for a children's book. <br /> <br /> Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), a very eccentric candy maker who runs a secretive and mysterious factory, plants five golden tickets in the wrappers of his chocolate bars, and the five lucky children who find them are invited to see his bizarre hideaway. <br /> <br /> All the children are perfect stereotypes of various kinds of kids:  There's the gluttonous one, the bratty one, the competitive one, the critical one, and, most importantly, the wholesome one, Charlie (Freddie Highmore).  It may seem pretty simplistic to have all of these characters so cut-and-dried, but Dahl's work tends toward stereotypical characters that are easy to identify.  One must remember that no matter how creepy it may seem, this is, at the end of the day, based on a children's book. <br /> <br /> And at times, it is a bit creepy.  Willy Wonka, with his pale face, strange hair, and high-pitched voice bears a frightening resemblance to Michael Jackson.  But the resemblance isn't so over-powering that you feel uncomfortable with the fact that he's in his \\"neverland\\" with these kids, and I got the impression that Willy Wonka is the person Michael Jackson tries to emulate, rather than the other way around. <br /> <br /> Wonka himself is very much like a child, with giddy navet and an almost bratty quality to him.  Through the course of the film, as the various bad stereotypes learn their lessons, Willy discovers he has a thing or two to learn as well.  <br />I must admit I have not seen the old musical, and know of it only by reputation, so I cannot fairly compare the two films.  However, I will say that this rendition has a fair amount of musical numbers, which start off as quite a surprise but soon become quite predictable. <br /> <br />Despite sparkling with Johnny Depp-flavored wit and Roald Dahl's beloved story, \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is blemished by Tim Burton's spooky touch, somehow managing to feel eerie even when it should be lighter.  <br />
0596007124|5.0|I give it 5 stars because it is a very, very, very good book on design patterns, written by ppl who know what they are doing.<br /><br />If you can afford only two books about design patterns, this is the second book you should get. The first is, of course, the Gang of Four (GoF) book.<br /><br />Don't let the whimsical attitude of this book fool you. Its most important feature is the explicit coupling of overarching object-oriented practices to design patterns.<br /><br />This is actually a book about applying best object-oriented practices using design patterns. Both of these critical topics [AND THEIR CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP] receive solid treatment.<br /><br />Bravo Elisabeth and Eric!
B000068OSK|3.0|This was a new one for me, I put it in at the listening party and at first my friends and I just laughed and got through a few tracks.  That laughter nearly turned to tears as the music went from annoying to grating.  Honestly White stripes is only good in small doses.  I'm an avid metal head and I'll even listen to a few of their songs, but come on, get a few more memebers, change the dials on your amp a little, or better yet, try using an acoustic and a different drum pattern.
B00005JNSK|4.0|Last weekend I went out and saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I've not read the book, nor seen the original, so I had no expectations for the story.<br /><br />This was typical Tim Burton fare: well-directed, with impressive visuals and a great cast. Burton always manages to assemble a great cast, and bring the best out of them. Not that Johnny Depp needs any real coaching to do a good job, mind you. The kid actors are splendid, which was good to see; if they hadn't been capable of doing a good job, this movie would have been toast.<br /><br />As for the storyline...it's a little oddball, and Willy Wonka clearly is calculating and non-personable (though I'mnot sure kids would see it this way)....all the kids who suffer horrible fates are clearly suffering pre-planned fates. Willy Wonka is clearly a character which needs redemption, and he does get it by movie's end, but the achievement of that goal seems a little weakly executed. This is a weak point on my part though, and shouldn't stop folks from enjoying the movie.<br /><br />This is not Tim Burton's best work, but it's still good, and definitely something to take the kids out to see!
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley culminated in Grace. His loss is indescribable, and yet the music lives on. &quot;Hallelujah&quot; is actually probably one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard. It's heart-wrenching, powerful, beautiful, and classically pure. Jeff Buckley's Grace is Purity in Music. Anything less than 5 stars is a travesty.
B00007G1ZC|4.0|The cinematography and imagery of these dreams are so \\"perfect\\" for the message(s), that the viewer is immediately drawn into the film.  That the film is Japanese is not a barrier.  Rather, the film successfully presents the imagery in a manner that allows an outside (Westerner) to understand the images and inuitively grasp the mythology and culture behind the film.<br /><br />Two dreams \\"Mount Fuji in Red\\" and \\"The Weeping Demon\\" do not make the historical leap, however.  They are interesting \\"period pieces.\\"  \\"Mount Fuji in Red,\\" an anti-nuclear piece, is mired strident views of its time - not rising to the more universal threat.  Note, however, that \\"The Tunnel\\", an anti-war piece does continues to powerfully express its views.<br /><br />\\"Crows\\" which is based on Vincent Van Gogh's work, shows Kurosawa adapting Western imagery to his Japanese work.  This is a wonderful piece that illustrates how cultural divisions can be bridged by film, film relying primarily on visual (rather than verbal) material.<br /><br />Fear, loneliness, death, joy, environmental concerns, peace and warfare, otherness ... many of the major themes of life are explored beautifully in this film.  Highly recommended.
B0009W5JR8|3.0|I have to say that the first Triple X with Vin was a lot better then this one!!!!!! This one was not to bad and had lots of action,but i didn't feel that Ice Cube should have been the new Triple X!!!!!!! The story is basic like the first and Ice Cube is after the secretary of Defense which is played by William Defoe which is the bad guy!!!!!! The movie had lots of action through the whole time and i would rent this one,but keep in mind that the first with Vin was a lot better!!!!!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This CD is beautiful to listen to. The music is absolutely ethereal; a beautiful blend of instruments and voices.  Several artists are included, all of them equally good.
B000002LND|5.0|This cd from the legendary icon Madonna is a must and it has all of our favorites like Vogue to Holiday to the sexy song Justify my Love with Lenny Kravtiz!!!!!! If you are a huge Madonna fan like myself then go and get this collection cd now!!!!!
B00005JNZ4|2.0|I just saw this tonight and, well, I had a straight face for quite a long period of time. I HIGHLY recommend this movie for women between ages 25-50. It contains several references to women that age, including a David Cassidy joke. <br /> <br />I, a 16 year old guy, was bored to death. I found no interesting story that could stand out from the millions of other chick-flick romantic comedies out there. <br /> <br />I do like John Cusack, but in this one he seemed kind of dull and boring and just not a very amusing character. I like him in roles that are a little more outgoing, like America's Sweethearts and Serendipity. In this movie, he seemed king of \\"mopey\\" and infected me with it too. <br /> <br />Diane Lane is quite a talented woman, but in this one she showed no real spark. She just played the divorced, middle-aged woman who just whines about wanting true love and how uninteresting she is. I also really didn't see any chemistry between Cusack and Lane that stood out to me. <br /> <br />So all men out there, you can take your wife or girlfriend to see this, and she'll love it. But be careful, you may find it a bit too chick-flick like. In my opinion, this weekend, have the men go see Stealth and the women go see this!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Britney Spears,but i do have to say that this cd rocks!!!!!! She teams up with Madonna on the track \\" Me Against the Music\\" which pumps your body to dance!!!!!! The other tracks are bubble gum fun and they have their own styles within each track!!!!! Take for instance the track called \\" Breathe on Me\\" its sexy and has enough techino to make a dance floor jump!!!!!!! I think that this cd is worth every penny!!!!!
0060989157|5.0|First off, I am NOT a Motley Crue fan.  Never have been.  That being said, I thought this book was incredible.  It's an honest and gripping true account of some average guys, who have more than their share of luck and talent, and get lost along the way in addiction.  A true account that addiction doesn't discriminate.  The thing I loved most about this book, was it wasn't a few hundred pages of ego's talking, instead it was a geniune portrayal of life.  The good, the bad...and the dirt.  This is one of the best, if not the best autobiographies I have ever read.
068987474X|4.0|I think this book was valuable to me for a couple of important reasons.  It's true that, even though it is a short, easy read, it gets long and redundant by the end.  Also, my two male roommates criticized it because they pointed out to me that men are not cardboard cutouts, and that sometimes men would rather just back off than risk making themselves look like an idiot in front of you (their words), even if they have a mad crush on you.  So, I think that shyness in a man was too summarily dismissed by the authors - sometimes a shy guy who is totally into you needs a bit of pursuing before he becomes confident enough to really show his feelings.  That being said, the first few chapters were extremely helpful in showing me that we girls need to approach male flirting and attention with a much bigger grain of salt than we usually do.  I used to believe that just because a guy flirted with me at a party and offered me his number, or even got mine, that meant that he was really into me.  Not so!  Sometimes guys just like to flirt and get your number to see if they can (an ex that I'm still friends with told me that).  Actually, many men will do much more than that with you just to see if they can, so to me this book's most valuable contribution to my dating life has been to teach me that I've been assigning meaning to the wrong actions.  Flirting with you at parties and sex do not mean he's into you.  Calling you when (or before, or much more often than) he says he's going to, bringing up the subject of marriage, wanting to spend lots of time with you alone but also wanting to introduce you to his friends, being eager to make plans far in advance (for example, asking you in February, \\"there's a lecture series at Columbia in April, it sounds really cool, do you want to go with me?\\") and discussing them with you all the time; in other words, constantly trying to bring you into all areas of his life - these are the correct signs that mean he's really crazy about you.  We should thank Greg for pointing this out, at least.    Even though we should know this, we girls often delude ourselves.
0142004235|5.0|Long before Oprah and her book club, I was a kid in school and ran out of books to read.  My Mom had the whole collection and I grumbled at the plain dictionary-type covers.  Little did I know that I was about to read a collection of the most magical author I've ever known.  East of Eden is something that you can only experience yourself.  It's my favourite out of all Steinbeck's novels (and there isn't one bad Steinbeck book that's not good).  I recommend this to you, your family, your friends, your children.  I think everyone should read this book once in their lifetime.
B0000714BP|1.0|I realize this is a very old movie, however, I expected more as to quality, sharpness and color. The reds were brown and faded and I was so disappointed because in the original movie the colors added so much to this film.  I so enjoyed this film, but would have appreciated it more if this DVD was of better quality.
1401301010|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked this book.  It's right up there with Motley Crue's The Dirt.  I appreciate Kiedis' honest account of his life thus far.  This read is compassionate, honest, exciting and I am quite surprised it isn't on the Bestseller list.  A hidden little gem, that I could not put down.  Hats off to Kiedis and I highly recommend it!
B000002HK4|4.0|Being new to Dream Theater, I'm still getting a feel for the diversity of their albums.  One of their latest albums, \\"Train of Thought,\\" really was what got me interested in DT in the first place because of the creative heavy rock.  So if you're looking to try out Dream Theater, I'd suggest you first try out \\"Train of Thought\\" or possibly \\"Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" to see if you like them. <br /> <br />As for \\"A Change of Seasons,\\" I enjoyed it for the most part.  The self-titled track is great, though it's cohesiveness suffers from the 23 minute running time.  I've listened to it several times, and I'm still trying to get an overall feel for the song as a whole.  As for the rest of the album, there's definitely some fun cover songs and medleys.  I like the 3rd track more and more each time.  And it's fun to listen to the Zeppelin songs as well.  The final track is a ton of fun starting out, with pieces like Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" int he mix, but it weakens as it goes on.  Unfortunately as a whole, the cover songs still feel like filler to me. <br /> <br />In the end, though, if you're a Dream Theater fan who already owns \\"Train of Thought,\\" \\"Scenes From a Memory,\\" and \\"Awake\\" then you may really find this a worthwhile album.  Heck, the self-titled track alone is worth it for the current Amazon price of $9.99.
B0009W5JS2|1.0|Do massive pyrotechnics, zinging masked invaders, impossible gimmicky flying objects in situational lapses of taste and intelligence, and implausible threats to the nation make a movie?  Does peppering this treacle of a script with some respectable actors (and eminently forgettable ones) make a movie?  For this viewer the answer is a solid 'nope'!  When oh when will Hollywood tire of this hyped disaster concept? This qualifies as a \\"must miss\\" movie. Grady Harp, July 05
B000006OS2|4.0|The movie itself was great, but the DVD quality seemed like a cheap bootleg knockoff
0671799320|4.0|The book itself often reads more like a business reporter in a local paper reporting rather then a historical study which I was looking for. I would like to have seen more charts and table showing overall what was happening rather then stories about this fellow and this fellow and so on. These people tend to be the major decision makers so we don't get a feel of what over time the geologist or engineers are doing.  <br /> <br />Still the writer makes a very good study of oil and the industry. He shows its relationship to many political and social developments in the 1900s. I found the particularly the history of early oil industry quite fascinating.
B0000067L2|5.0|When you play this album you can almost smell the patchouli. Creams' 2nd and perhaps best album came out in the latter 60s when pop was music was getting heavier and expanding to other areas. Jimi Hendrix had arrived and opened the door to even more experimentation than The Beatles had already provided with Sgt Pepper. In England, Eric Clapton was already a legendary guitar player because of his stints with The Yardbirds and John Mayalls'Bluesbreakers respectively.Clapton, the restless musical wanderer, was searching for something completely different and unique than he had found in his two former bands and was hoping that his collabaration with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker would bear fruit.  <br /> Cream immediately became the first \\"supergroup\\" as well as the first power trio. Their first album, \\"Fresh Cream\\", foretold of a new musical direction, part blues, part jazz, part pop/rock and pure creative energy. Fresh Cream wasn't a great album but it was very good and promised that this band was going somewhere and should be watched carefully. It was mostly because of Claptons'guitar god image that Cream became a supergroup but after one listen it became apparent that Bruce and Baker were just as exciting as Eric and would have a lot to do with the success of this new \\"hybrid\\" band. <br />  Aware that the world was watching, Cream released their 2nd album, \\"Disraeli Gears\\", a virtual masterpiece. From the opening strains of \\"Strange Brew\\", a modern electric blues number with Clapton on vocals through \\"Swlabr (acronymn for \\"she was like a bearded rainbow\\")and We're Going Wrong\\", it was evident that Cream could live up to the supergroup hype that the press and public had bestowed on them. There was energy and drive in every song on the album. Bruces' moody and rich vocals gave the band a distinct sound on top of Gingers' manic but controlled drumming and Clapton was on fire playing clean bluesy notes which puncuated everything else that was going on. There was a lot of music coming out of 3 guys here and a lot of variety in every song.\\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" hit the charts both in the UK and America and made Cream a household word. <br />  Other songs to note: World of Pain with Clapton on vocal and wah-wah pedal over Bruces' mournful but beautiful bass playing, it's a nice ballad.Tales of Brave Uylsses is Bruce at his best on vocals and the lyrics, written by Peter Brown, are mysterious and dark.Clapton provides the wah-wah pedal again, fittingly so and Ginger Baker pounds on the double foot bass and keeps the rhythm moving along.Outside Woman Blues is a blues song sung by Clapton with the memorable line \\"you can't trust your wife and your outside woman too\\". Clapton plays a clean ascending guitar line doubled by Jacks' bass and there's a short but effective Clapton solo in the middle. We're Going Wrong is another beautiful ballad sung by Bruce and Ginger Baker even gets a vocal on Blue Condition <br /> In retrospect, Disraeli Gears is not a long album but it's the kind that you just might want to play again when it ends. This album is a good indicator of where popular music was at at this point in time and even hinted at where it might be going.Creams' life as a band was too short but they were long on creativity and innovation, one of the best ever.If you're only going to buy 1 Cream album this might be the one you want
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|Ok, we've all established that this isn't season 1, and it never will be. GET OVER IT ALREADY!!!! Now, Season 2 was just as cleverly written and just as cleverly acted as Season 1, with the exception of Mischa Barton who just plain annoys me now. Adam Brody and Peter Gallagher should seriously be considered for Best Actor/Supporting Actor in a Comedy/Drama. Hell, if Desperate Housewives can be nominated for an Emmy, why can't The O.C.? Those two have me cracking up week after week. Just hearing those two themselves will be worth the money. There were some annoying and plain unneeded characters this season, such as D.J. Someone remind why he was there please cuz I can't figure it out for the life of me. Alex could have made season 3 very interesting if they kept her. Zach needs to go. I can't begin to tell you how annoying his character has become. He's just so pseudo Prince Charming that it makes me ill. He better not be back for season 3. Julie Cooper-Nichol's little porno incident was HILARIOUS, and followed through with an interesting storyline, a very interesting storyline. Luke needs to move back because Newport is blah without him being all, Luke-like. By far, Trey was the BEST character this season, which is a lot for a new character coming in mid-season. His storyline was executed so well that it gave me goosebumps. The only thing that was kinda stupid was the Jen chick that just moved into his apartment. She did however, add some intrigue and suspense into the show, but we still don't know much about her. Hopefully she doesn't disappear like Lindsey. She was such an awesome character and completely perfect for Ryan, which is why I felt it for him when her last episode was \\"The Rainy Day Women\\". Yes, I downloaded the episodes that I missed, so I know the titles. I must say, I loved to hate Caleb Nichol, but I shed a tear when he had the heart attack at the pool. It was the most moving moment of the season, by far. As much as he was a horse's ass, he will bemissed. The writer's of the season finale should get an Emmy also. That was the most riveting episode ever, and totally did not see the last 5 minutes coming. If you haven't seen season 1, I suggest you watch it first before watching season 2, because a lot of the jokes will go over your head, and you won't understand a lot of the conflict. Ben McKenzie needs to applause, he's just incredible, absolutely incredible. That is one awesome actor. Kelly Rowan moved me to tears in her departure on the season finale also. There is so much emotion involved in the finale, that I strongly advise you to grab a box of tissues because regardless of how tough you may think you are, you will get some \\"eye allergies\\" during this touching season finale. I can't stress enough how moving that episode really is. It alone is worth the price of the entire season. This show should seriously be considered for the Emmys, it is extremely underrated and not taken as seriously as it should.
B000002KGT|1.0|Yes, I remember how popular this album was when it debuted back in the 1970s. And, I can also remember how terribly unimpressed I was by it. Although I came to admire some of Stevie Nicks' solo work which was to come later, I found songs like \\"Dreams\\" and \\"The Chain\\" to be dreadfully unmoving and somewhat repetitive in a way. Christine McVie has the charisma of a cactus along with a voice that is as flat a countertop. Mick Fleetwod is one of the most unexpressive drummers around and looks like he should be panhandling on a street corner somewhere. John McVie was a capable bassist, but the biggest douche of all in the group was Lindsay Buckingham, whom I had the displeasure of seeing interviewed once. This guy thinks he's God's gift to the musical world, while he actually is not, by any  means whatsoever, a great guitarist. And he should also find a way to sing with his mouth tightly shut. I acknowledge that Fleetwood Mac had and still has a lot of fans, and I am proud to say that I am not one of them.
B0007GAEGC|1.0|<br />This is \\"Easy Listening\\" music, the kind of stuff they play in an elevator. I say skip it because you can do better.  <br /> <br />You would be better off listening to all the Enya they are ripping off. She does it better anyway. These \\"Celtic Women\\" are about as Celtic as Brittany Spears.  <br /> <br />Heck they sing \\"Danny Boy\\" for goodness sake. Only people pretending to be Irish sing \\"Danny Boy.\\" You want to listen to what Irish people like? Try Flogging Molly. Try The Saw Doctors. Heck try U2.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002I25|5.0|\\"The Doors\\" is what I consider to be the group's best album, and I feel that they were the best rock band to come out of America. Jim Morrison's powerful voice and eerie, imagistic lyrics are backed splendidly by the other three musicians. Ray Manzarek's haunting organ-playing complements Morrison superbly. Robbie Krieger, while perhaps not a great guitarist, nevertheless does justice to the music, especially with his fine slide guitar work on \\"Moonlight Drive\\". John Densmore's drumming also complements Morrison finely in may instances with his rat-a-tat-tat style of playing. This is to put it simply, a splendid album from a superb group. In fact, the little weasel Mick Jagger once publicly criticized the Doors. Well, this overrated little pipsqueak could learn a lot from a fine group like The Doors, who, in my opinion, were light years ahead of this  scrawny little twirp and his noisy group, all of whose members presently belong in nursing homes.
B0002VEX7S|5.0|<br />Of course you could say that about all of her CDs.  But I really thing this CD stands out even in the company of her other work. <br /> <br />Mummers' Dance is simply one of the best songs of our time.  With this song alone, McKennitt demonstrates she is a musical force. <br /> <br />Serenissima is another great song and worth buying the CD for. <br /> <br />And of course Dante's Prayer is a fan favorite and an excellent choice to close the CD. <br /> <br />All I can say if that if you don't own this CD you should fix that now. <br />
B000000W5P|1.0|To Kid Reviewer: I probably know more about the Stones than you suspect. I know their music, the albums, and the guitar players they've both had and have. OK-Lennon was wrong-but I still think it's a s--t album, and they've been a s--t group since the mid-1970s. They started as a blues band, but lost their identity along the way and ran out of steam after \\"It's Only Rock 'N Roll\\". By the release of \\"Some Girls\\", however, in the late 1970s, this miserable album was solid evidence that Mick and the boys had run out of steam. In the absence of lead guitarist Mick Taylor, a fine blues guitarist whose dignity vanished when he joined the Stones, this group sounds like one that has lost its identity. They weren't sure if they were a disco band or a rock/blues band. Mick Jagger thought he was being clever by incorporating a disco sound on \\"Miss You\\" but I feel that it blew up in his already ugly face. Ron Wood, an abject Keith Richards wannabe with no style of his own, made things even worse with his insignificant presence and muddled guitar work. John Lennon was correct in a Rolling Stone interview when he said that the Stones do nothing that is original and that Mick Jagger is merely a copycat. He said at one point, \\"We put out Let It Be, and then they put out Let It Bleed. Come on already!\\" I agree.
1573223026|5.0|<br />Nick Hornsby's A Long Way Down is a black comedy charmer. His character Jess, the angry, foul-mouthed and clueless young punk is one of the freshest and most delightful characters to come down the pike in a long time. Young actresses in Hollywood and London will be fighting tooth-and-nail for the chance to play her in the film because she's the moral center of the novel and a full-on career-maker for the right talent. And rest assured, this novel will certainly be made into a film. Like Hornsby's other books High Fidelity and About a Boy, the dialogue crackles and carries the full energy of the characters. Combine that with the irresistible charm of Hornsby's theme (the redemptive quality of human relationships, particularly among strange bedfellows) and you've got a confection Hollywood can't resist and audiences are eager to gobble up.  <br /> <br />Nothing wrong with that, I say. In these jaded days when sentimentality is sniffed out and throttled before it can peek out of its hole, it's good to know that a modern day Frank Capra is at work, producing smile-quirking stories with real characters, contemporary settings and plausible plots. And Hornsby never takes the easy way out. From losers laboring in a record store in a pathetic attempt to give shape to their lives (High Fidelity), to a self-centered lothario trying to avoid being sucked into the swamp of genuine human emotions (About a Boy), he gives us characters that are initially despicable, and lulls us into loving them. With A Long Way Down, he walks further out onto the ledge.  <br /> <br />The four characters in this book are attempting to commit suicide. Their reasons range from the understandable to the idiotic to the vain. It's hard to get close to them; a couple of them are so irredeemable or so damaged they're off-putting, and the other two just seem self-centered. The gauntlet Hornsby has thrown down is that he is going to make them sympathetic and lovable and charming, and sure enough,he does. Hornsby has raised the bar and vaulted over it. This is courageous writing, an author in search of new levels, and he goes right after them, bringing us along.  <br /> <br />America needs a writer like Hornsby today (even though he is ever so English). We need to know there's still something charming and delightful about even the most seemingly distasteful individuals and we need to be reminded that the way to discover the richness of our fellow human beings has almost nothing to do with defining moral goodness on our own terms and trying to force people to conform to it, but has almost everything to do with ferreting out the moral goodness as it resides in the souls of some of the most unlikely people and opening our arms to it. Hornsby understands this and communicates it better than any writer of our time. His work in necessary and true - which is why so many readers (and movie goers) have flocked to it.  <br /> <br />I'm reminded of a writing assignment I had in high school. Take an unlikely situation and see how you can develop it. If this was Hornsby's first book, it would never have seen the light of day. Four people who happen upon each other while attempting to commit suicide and become friends and learn how to cope and move on. Right. How can you write this so it's not clichd and dripping with maudlin sentimentality? How can you write it so it's clever and funny and true with a few laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled in? How do you write it so it means something, other than the obvious? Well, ask Nick Hornsby. He's the artist, in all the best meanings of the term. Courageous, sensitive and talented. He's answered all the questions. All you have to do is read A Long Way Down to find the answers.
B0007OASII|5.0|<br />   If you really think to choose one power metal album, with a touch of epica, progressive, mind blowing guitars, great voice a la \\"Geoff Tate\\", and incredible musicianship, this is the album!!! Kamelot really did with this!!! Highly recommended!!! <br />     <br />   <br />
B0000584V3|5.0|I was a regular prog guy, my thing was the usual prog catalogue, YES, ELP, Genesis, Van der Graaf Generator, King Krimson etc, but at some point I was bored listening to the same stuff over and over again, so there was a period of experimentation with the new wave of progressive rock.  <br /> <br />I listened to almost everything, from Marillion, Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater, Glass Hammer, Spock's Beard, Transantlantic, etc. etc. I confess that I havent got to groups like Tangent, King Flowers and the like, yet. But anyways, I did my research. <br /> <br />Porcupine Tree became a favourite, and in the beginning I didnt like Dream Theater that much, but I tried to understand their music, I tried to like their much heavier interpretation of progressive music. And slowly but steadily I got hooked. It all started with Dream Theaters's \\"Live at Budokan\\", a masterpiece of live music, performance and virtuosity. \\"Live at Budokan\\" contained most of their heavy, very heavy indeed, Train of Thought album. <br /> <br />So slowly, because of Dream Theater I started listening to heavier prog, bordering on the prog metal. And then of course I started looking at amazon in the \\"prog metal\\" section, until I found this. <br /> <br />Let me say to the progers out there like me that they will enjoy this, a lot. Wilson's influence from Porcupine Tree is all over the place here, he brings his unique soundscapes that have this feeling of inner loneliness. The music is beautifull, melodic, complex, loud. I like this album much better than any heavy Dream Theater release to be honest. <br /> <br />When I was sampling the music to see if I like it, in the beginning I was scared by the singing, this is not singing, this is growling. BUT, it is not disturbing, you get accustomed to it, at some point you get to like it, BECAUSE it is not dominating the music, it is not there all the time, so let this not distruct you. In most of the album the singing becomes melodic and normal, the way progerslike it. I know that metal fans will laugh at me for complaining about the growling, but guys, PLEASE try to understand where I come from, for the past years I have been listening to Jon Anderson's voice from YES, who sounds like Mini Mouse sometimes, and believe me, transitioning to Opeths growling is a big big step forward.    <br /> <br />The music is beautifull, and I recommend it to all progers out there like myself who are in search of something fresh. <br />Progressive music is like a drug, and it seems that Opeth are just a much heavier aspect of what we like. Definetely give it a spin. <br /> <br />I am not sure about their other albums, and this review is not about Opeth, is is about this masterpiece of an album. Definetely I will get to all their albums in the upcoming weeks. I will keep you posted.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I loved it. The people in this movie are so realistic and quirky, you just gotta love this movie. It's definelty a bit of a cult film; only certain people love it. Some rules to enjoying this film are: You have to know that there are only two main stories in this film, but not many others. This movie is about jokes, the people, and the fact that there's a bit of Napolean in all of this, and that this is reality spat in our faces. We only care about what we look like, but that fact is, you can only be who you really are. Great film.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Shakira innova su musica en cada album. Desde el lanzamiento de \\"Pies Descalzos\\" en 1996 hasta este ultimo, ella supo demostrarle a la sociedad que no es una chica que va a pasar de moda. Ella de reinventa dia a dia.   \\"Fijacion Oral Vol.1\\" es el CD es espaol por excelencia:    1. En tus pupilas ---> colocas el cd en tu reproductor y no hay forma que las primeras frases en frances no deleiten tus sentidos. Es un tema que relajara cada parte de tu ser, un verdadero manjar!    2. La Pared ---> Con un aire a la musica de Coldplay (pero a lo Shakira) ella logra hacer que sientas el tema por dentro con una interpretacion y una voz desgarradora que te dejara sin palabras. Just push play!!...    3. La Tortura ---> Creo que no hay nada que decir, es el primer single del album y demuestra realmente una combinacion de sonidos que va desde el Reaguetton hasta la guitarra acustica. Te hace mover hasta el dedo gordo del pie.    4. Obtener un si ---> Shakira en esta cancion sale a relucir su admiracion por el bossanova y mediante una orquesta que cuenta con violines, flautas y violocelos, nos transporta a los aos '60 donde este ritmo dominaba el mundo.     5. Dia Especial ---> A mi parecer, una de las mejores canciones del Album. Gustavo Cerati (ex-soda stereo), hizo un magnifico trabajo junto a  Shakira, y el verdadero rock latinoamericano quedo plasmado en este tema.     6. Escondite Ingles ----> Este tema es quizas el mas rockero del album, muy instintivo y muy fiel al buen rock. Desde el comienzo del tema te dara ganas de moverte y de romper todo lo que tengas cerca, jajaja.     7. No ---> Una de las mejores baladas que escuche en mi vida, y no estoy exagerando. La voz de Shakira en este tema da un giro de 180 grados y te hara poner la piel de gallina.     8. Las de la Intuicion ---> Un tema que empieza con un aire electronico y al final te cautiva con el ritmico estribillo. La letra es perfecta para las mujeres, pero tambien le puede ser util a los hombres.    9. Dia de Enero ---> La cancion perfecta para escuchar a orillas del mar, cuando se pone el sol y la brisa del aire recorre tu cara. Cancion que le dedic a su novio Argentino \\"Antonio\\", muestra desde timbales hasta el famoso bandoneon. La voz de Shakira suena muy dulce.     10. Lo Imprescindible ---> Uno de los temas mas potentes del album. Suena a los primeros albumes de \\"Depeche Mode\\" pero siempre conservando la pura escencia de la musica de Shakira.     11. La Pared ---> Una maravillosa interpretacion acustica del tema. Solo ella y un piano. Te dejara sin aliento!!..    12. La Tortura (Shaketon Mix)---> Mucho mas hot que la version original, muestra al mundo el ritmo que dominara al mundo las proximos aos.    No podes no comprarlo... es una verdadera joyita musical!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I also saw Firefly today on Sci-Fi for the first time as well. Well, actually, I remember when the series began on Fox but I never bothered to give it a chance. But now, intrigued because of the film coming out soon, I decided to give it a try now that it's on television again, and now I feel like such a dunce for missing out on this show the first time around. First off, Firefly is a space western, and if I had known that before by giving the show a chance, I would've loved it much sooner. Firefly was not meant to be like Buffy, or Angel. It's a completely different show except the humor is quite reminiscent of Joss Whedon's other shows. I never really liked Buffy, or Angel, but Firefly was right up my alley. The western influences are much more prevalent than I thought (the characters actually sound like cowboys), and combined with its sci-fi counterpart, Firefly sort of reminds me of \\"The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.,\\" but more sci-fi and with a much more serious tone. <br /> <br />Anyway, I really liked what I saw. It was funny, it was western, it was sci-fi (kind of like Star Wars), and, most importantly, had compelling characters. I'm definitely ordering the DVD set.
B00005QY5Y|3.0|Not a review of the whole album (definitely on the good side of decent), but \\"Harder Now That It's Over\\" is a genuine 5 star song - one of the best Bonnie-and-Clyde type country songs ever written.   <br /> <br />\\"They slapped them on you <br />Where that bracelet used to be <br />The one I bought in Phoenix <br />Where they sell old jewelry..\\" <br /> <br />It's really good.
B0002X314C|4.0|Considering the significant marketing drive marking this album's release, I had convinced myself to shelve this one with the likes of Alicia Keys et al. However, after my initial listen I was, to my surprise, mildly impressed. Since then my liking for this fantastic piece of progressive RnB/Soul has grown with each listen to the point where it gets an outing at least once a week! <br /> <br />As a credible musician and a thoughtful writer, I guess the obvious route for Legend to have taken would be that of Neo Soul or Smooth Jazz. However, his choosing to instead bring a fresh approach to the stale, over commercialised, unoriginal and down right boring world of RnB is to be commended. Moreover, in rejecting the neo soul camp he has in fact turned his back on a bunch of self-righteous, boring, deadbeats whose music has become as uniform and uninteresting as the RnB that they malign. I would even go so far as to say that I think Legend has started a trend here, as a number of previously staunch neo soulsters are starting to wise up to the fact that the rhodes piano isn't the be all and end all of good music. A little humour, musical variation and the ability to remain true to ones own musical tastes and youthfulness actually goes a long way! This album proves this. Highly recommended!
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Everything you need to know about film, about the 1960s and about cool is contained within. Time has been kind to this film, unlike many other acclaimed 'masterpieces' of the era and stands as a superb mystery as well as a time-capsule of 60s hip. Too many greta moments to thumbnail here and all are well worth the price of admission. A must have for cinema fans and the casual lover of mystery movies alike. Deserves 10 stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Here's a theory:  Ninety-nine out of one hundred people who check out \\"Firefly\\" love it.  Not like.  Not enjoy.  Love.  Read some of these reviews if you don't believe me.  Why don't you give it a shot?  Check Sci-Fi channel, the DVDs, whatever.  One warning, though - you won't be the exception.  Get ready to love a TV show (and upcoming feature film)!
B000001E8S|5.0|I've owned this album for over 8 years and I continually come back to it as my favorite U2 album.  I find the individual songs and the album as a complete experience grow on me with each listening.  When I first listened to it I enjoyed a few songs but now I can appreciate the entire album. <br /> <br />I enjoy all of U2's other albums but this one really moves me more than any of the others.  Its music is more cerebral and experimental than the rest.  Want to hear Brian Eno singing, Bono playing the piano, Edge singing and playing the organ, and Adam Clayton narrating?  Then you want this album.  I can understand not issuing this album as a \\"U2\\" album.  If they had released it just like an ordinary album then many U2 fans would have been angry/confused by what they heard.   <br /> <br />I like to think of U2 as an artistic band, especially as a counter balance to their popular face.  I'm sure Eno had a strong influence over this album but I'm also confident that U2's members contributed a great deal of material.  This album combined with the DVD \\"Classic Albums - U2: The Joshua Tree\\" gives you a very different picture of U2 than might come across while listening to their pop corpus.  More than any of their B-Sides, this album is major departure from what one would expect from U2. <br /> <br />All that said, many people that like U2 would probably dislike this album, however if you own all their other albums you should really add this one to your collection.
B00000G3PL|5.0|When me and my dad first got our dvd player 5 years ago, this boxed was one of the first things we bought. Containg all four of the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" movies, this set includes four of the best cop movies ever made, all digitally remastered. Here is a synopsis of each movie.<br /><br />\\"Lethal Weapon\\" (1987, R) The first film in the series has L.A. Police Officer Roger Martough (Danny Glover) investigating the murder of Amanda Hudsacker, the daugter of a war buddy. Meanwhile, Martin Riggs is a cop on the edge. Suicidal after the death of his wife, he is unbearable to be with. Martough is a consumate family man with three kids and a loving wife. So how can these two possibly work together? Well, when it is revealed that Amanda's dad had his daughter murered by a drug ring ledy by Gary Buset, Riggs and Martaugh will stop at nothing to bring them down. This results in some of the greatest action sequences ever put on film.<br /><br />Glover and Gibson both found their signature roles as the buddy cops in this film. Busey as usual plays an excellent bad guy. The action scenes are great and the film is also very funny. 5/5<br /><br />\\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" (1989, R) The second film in the series has Gibson andc Glover returning to their respective roles. Adding to the fun is Joe Pesci as motot mouth money launderer Leo Getz, who is in witness protction and is put under the watchful eyes Martin and Roger. When a drug ring starts to operate in L.A., Martin and Roger are out to stop it. This film includes several great action sequences as well as the famous exploding toilet scene, and is filled with action and laughs provided by the excellent performances of Gibson, Glover amd Joe Pesci. 5/5<br /><br />\\"Lethal Weapon 3\\" (1993, R) Returning after a four year hiatus, Gibson, Glover and Pesci have reunited for this sequel. Roger is about to retire, keaving Martin feeling down. Leo is now a pain in the a*& insurance agent trying to sell Roger's house with no luck. And Rene Russo plays the lovely Internal Affairs agent who Martin falls hard for. But when a crime ring operating in the city starts manufacturing bullet piercing armor and start dealing guns to criminals, Murtaugh teams up with Riggs once more and it results in another all out adventure highlighted by an 80 feet motorcycle jump. It's more of the same with the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" gang. And that's a damn good thing. 5/5<br /><br />\\"Lethal Weapon 4\\" (1998, R) Five years aftet the third saga, Gibson, Glover, Pesci and Russo return for the fourth chapter. Riggs and Lorna are expecting a child, Leo is now a cop, and Murtaugh is about to become a grandfather. Chris Rock joins the cast as the new cop on the force, bringing his trademark brand of humor into the mix. And Jet Li stars as the leader of an Asian crime ring who Riggs and Murtaugh are out to get in one last adventure. I know a lot of people do not like this chapter, but this one is my personal favorite and a great way to bring everything full circle. 5/5<br /><br />This is an excellent boxed set that belongs in any dvd collection. Buy it as soon as you're able to do so.so plays the lovely Internal Affairs agent who Martin falls hard for.

B00063MBU8|1.0|This album is probably the worst album I have ever heard. First time I heard any of the whiny pop ballads on tv, I almost puked on the carpet in front of me. Of course Ive tried to find someway to like these songs but all of them are horrid. Simple Plan is just a bunch of whiny idiots who whine about how they werent popular in highschool. OH BO HOO, do you realize that there are people living in other countries who are starving being mutilated etc.. or are faced with many other horrible and depressing situations? Oh no lets all cry for your woes BOO HOO HOO. Not only is this cd filled with annoying moans from this pussy and lame singer who claims hes punk but the guitar work is horrible. All there is, is unoriginal powerchords and thats it, no solos, no unique riffs. <br /> <br />I could just go on about how bad of a band simple plan is but I have to go on my vacation, cheers
1573223026|5.0|I listened to this book from audible.com and I absolutely loved it.  It is a great story for anyone who has ever gone through a rough time, or has ever wanted to go through a rough time just to see what it feels like.  Very descriptive, this is a book of ups and downs that is somewhat akin to The Breakfast Club, only more grown-up.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I am not exaggerating when I say that Veronica Mars is UPN's best show in... well ever I guess (I'm not counting Buffy the Vampire Slayer because it originated and had the majority of its run on the WB).  Veronica Mars is well-written, intelligent, well-acted, fun, dramatic, witty, and all that other good stuff that makes people want to watch each week.  While powerhouse shows like Lost (which deserves the hype it is getting) and Desperate Housewives (which I doubt deserves the hype it's getting) may get all the credit for making the 2004-2005 television season responsible for the return of the scripted show, critics (as well as a handful of loyal fans) never forget to mention Veronica Mars when discussing that topic.  Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) used to be a member of the \\"in\\" crowd at her affluent high school, Neptune High.  Neptune California is one of the richest areas in America (probably something like Orange County, but that area is reserved for The OC), and as Veronica states in the pilot episode, kids who go to Neptune High have parents who are either millionaires or parents that work for millionaires.  Veronica's dad doesn't exactly fit that profile, but he used to be the town sheriff.  That was enough to get her enough status to date Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn) and be best friends with Lily Kane (Amanda Seyfried), the children of the richest man in town, software designer Jake Kane (Kyle Secor).  She also got to hang around with Lily's boyfriend, Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), the son of A-list stars Aaron (Harry Hamlin) and Lynn Echolls (Lisa Rinna, who is actually married to Hamlin in real life).  However, all that changed about a year prior to the beginning of the series, and the people that used to be Veronica's friends now try to have nothing to do with her.  Lily was killed, and Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni), who was still the sheriff at the time, concluded that Lily's father Jake was the culprit.  But when a man named Abel Koontz (Christian Clemenson) confessed to the killing, the citizens of Neptune were outraged and had Keith replaced by the incompetant Don Lamb (Michael Muhney).  Soon after, Veronica, in an attempt to prove that she was still cool, went to a girl's party.  At some point, someone slipped her a date rape drug, and she woke up the next day without her underwear on.  As the series begins, Keith is now a private investigator, and Veronica is in his tutelage.  She helps him with his cases, while taking on a few herself.  She has become cynical towards her classmates and the law system, and she begins to see her old friends for who they really are, especially Logan.  While he was (usually) nice to the people he liked, he was a total jerk to those he didn't like, and he has a special kind of wrath towards Veronica.  Fortunately for Veronica, she has her keen intellect on her side as well as a few new friends who are fellow outcasts.  Wallace Fennel (Percy Dags III) is a new kid whom Veronica helps on his first day at Neptune High.  After that, they become friends and she often has him do case-related work with her.  Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro (Francis Capra) is a biker gang member who learns to respect Veronica, and does some of her dirty work for her.  Finally there is Mac (Tina Majorino, famous for her role in Napoleon Dynamite), who does computer work for Veronica (sadly, she's only in a few episodes, but I hope that they use her more in Season 2).  Early on in the season, Veronica discovers evidence that proves the innocence of Abel Koontz, and the driving story arc of the season is her search for Lily's true killer.  However, there are many great and interesting sub-plots throughout the year, as well as stand-alone stories.  The character development is amazing on this show.  As I stated earlier, Logan is a bit of a psychopath, but as the episodes unfold, we learn that there may be a reason for his behavior.  Many times, we think we have a character figured out, only to learn something new and unexpected about them in a few weeks, such as a supposed affair between Jake Kane and Veronica's mom Lianne (Corinne Bohrer), or an explanation to Duncan's erratic behavior.  The guest stars on this show are just as strong as the regular cast.  The Aaron Echolls character is one of my favorites, despite the fact that he is a scumbag.  Hamlin plays him so well and gives a lot of depth to a role that, in the wrong hands, could make Aaron Echolls very one-dimensional.  While the producers weren't able to get a lot of huge guest stars, they did get Alyson Hannigan for an episode as Logan's step-sister Trina Echolls, and the results were great.  Many people have called this show \\"the next Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", and I would have to agree with them.  The writing and acting are on par with the amazing BtVS, and of all the shows that have used the theme of either \\"girl power\\" or \\"high school metaphors\\" (there's Charmed, Smallville, Kim Possible, and a bunch of others), this is by far the best and its mission statement is the closest to that of Buffy.  The twist is that while the aforementioned shows involve some sort of special powers (witches, Superman, super secret agent with gadgets), Veronica has no powers.  She is an ordinary girl with an extraoridnary mind.  And that is probably one of its greatest strengths; while it aspires to be as great and in the same vein as Buffy, it does not blatantly rip off the premise.  As I said at the beginning of this review, the two shows that most people credit for bringing back scripted TV this year were Lost and Desperate Housewives, even though most television critics listed Veronica Mars as just as worthy of that honor.  Sadly, this show didn't get very high ratings, and many people ignored it (I didn't see it until the second-to-last episode of the season, but what do they expect, it's on UPN!).  Fortunately, it won E! Online's annual \\"Save Our Show\\" poll with a huge margin over the number two show (Arrested Development, which thankfully won a similar poll in USA Today, which probably helped that show get a third season).  I think that, without winning the poll, Veronica Mars would have been cancelled at the end of the season, and that would have been a shame.  Fortunately, it has been renewed, and there were a few cliffhangers in the season finale that I can't wait to see resolved.  This is a great show, and it has something for everyone.  It's definitely worth a look.
B0006OBPTA|1.0|I love this film! I want everyone to still buy this dvd! The movie is the best film ever made. <br /> <br />but.. <br /> <br />The DVD Extras are terrible! I couldn't even get through the Commentary Track. I hate when they have 3 or 4 people all trying to talk at once! They should have made 2 SEPERATE Commentary Tracks!! <br /> <br />1 with Pat & Ralph <br />1 with the Director & Writer. <br /> <br />NOT all on one track talking over each other. <br /> <br />
0609610570|5.0|Execution is a fast read. Very well written and thoughtful, I found it jam-packed with practical advice.  I read with a highlighter in my hand and was constantly marking it up. Why? Because it gives a manager who is also a \\"student of the game\\" a great resource for improving both decision making and follow through skillsets.
B00082IJ08|2.0|it is alright. i like only one main song. the others are not what type of music that i am really into.
B00005RHGL|5.0|\\"Tombstone\\" without a doubt is a epic among Westerns produced during the latter part of the 20th Century.  Kurt Russell is great as Wyatt Earp, but Val Kilmer (as Doc Holliday) steals the show.  He is truly magnificant and adds a depth to the character that has not been shown in earlier versions of the \\"gunfight at OK Corral\\".<br /><br />The direction under George Cosmatos is outstanding and gives the viewer a more than realistic view of life in the western US during the latter parts of the 19th Century.<br /><br />An outstanding supporting cast helps to make this one of the more memorable westerns of all time.  Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, et al, are terrific as the antagonists of the Earp Brothers.  Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton as Virgil and Morgan Earp, respectively, create memorable characters.<br /><br />Truly an outstanding work, this DVD belongs in the collection of every fan of this era or genre'.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0316172324|2.0|Blink is a fun read, full of interesting anecdotes presented in Gladwell's typical writing style--threaded together from one to the next, like one big dinner party discussion. And if this is all one expects, it is enough. But Blink also tries to make an argument, and the weakness of that argument ultimately spoils the book.  <br /> <br />For anyone who's read Gladwell's writings in The New Yorker, Blink will be familiar in its off-beat focus on, well, whatever. Having previously written on such diverse subjects as the appeal of ketchup and job interviewing, Gladwell seems to be merely presenting a collection of stories about \\"thin slicing\\", as he calls it--the ability of people to make snap judgements. But in fact, Gladwell tries to convince the reader of the latent power of the brain's \\"thin slicer\\", to show that deliberation, logic, and carefully conscious thinking can, in fact, be drawbacks. It is here that Blink falls apart.  <br /> <br />First, Gladwell is never really clear on what his definition of \\"thin slicing\\" is--some vague form of intuition, of course, but past that he focuses very little on what, neurologically, he actually believes is going on. Instead, he sticks to these anecdotes, which, in fact, frequently don't really help his case.  <br /> <br />In fact, Blink could be forgiven for a little bit of vagueness--as a pop author, Gladwell knows his readers don't want heavy science and dry evidence collecting. But the skewed, unconvincing, often contradictory evidence presented by his anecdotes is sometimes unforgivable. For example, he presents, at one point, the story of a professor so skilled at reading facial expressions that, just by looking at a few frames of video, he could identify the members of a peaceful South American tribe as easy going, while he picked out members of a warrior tribe with a tradition of homosexuality as violent people with \\"much evidence to suggest homosexuality.\\" Are we really expected to take this story as proof that onecan identify violent traits, not to mention sexual habits, merely from facial expressions? <br /> <br />Gladwell sticks to his pop-science in many of his other anecdotes, eschewing unbaised accounts and empirical evidence in favor of interesting stories and, even, interpreting each account to uniformly support his hypothesis (careful readers of the Cook County Hospital story can be forgiven for wondering if this doesn't in fact disprove the power of intuition).  <br /> <br />Understandably, Gladwell doesn't want to author a dry book of psychology that will sit on shelves in university libraries, but he owes it to the reader to get his facts straight and hold himself to the same standards as, well, real scientists. Read this book if you need to pick up some conversation starters. Don't bother if you want to learn anything concrete.
B00003CXXR|5.0|This is even better than the first or second Jurassic Park movies! I loved the fighting, the love, the humor, the gore, the intense sequences, and of course the old school and new dinosaurs! It was so wicked and fun to watch this, and I most certainly have seen it a lot more than once! The fight between the T-Rex and the enormous Spinosaurus was just about my favorite part, and the final fight in the air and water was the next runner-up! And, of course, the sound  was as good as it should be, too! This movie was a great ending to a great series and I think everyone who has seen the first two need to see this! IT'S PERFECT! PERFECT! PERFECT! PERFECT! I demand you to get it now! SEE IT, IN THE NAME OF LOVE! NOOOOOW!!!!
B0000C23DO|4.0|I'm a pretty big Dead fan. I do perfer there live albums over this but the album gets it done. Not many songs from American Beauty and Live/Dead are on this Cd. I don't understand that. But it does have many Dead hits. Basically every song on this cd is a great song. My personal favorites are Fire on the Mountain, Franklin's Tower, Casey Jones, and Friend of the Devil. A good buy for people just getting into The Dead.
B00004U8JV|5.0|I didn't think The Lost World would be able to top the first movie of the Jurassic Park franchise. I was wrong. Dead wrong. This is such a wonderful movie. More dinos, more action, more intensity, more scary stuff, more everything! And on top of that, the raptors and T-Rexs are back, more vicious and deadlier than ever! I really liked the quotes \\"Are you crazy? Don't you know what that is?\\", \\"Mommy's very angry\\", and \\"Hey you raptors! You're going back to extinction!\\" All in all, this was a spectacular movie and I was very surprised that I found it better than the first one. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes dinosaurs or the first JP movie.
B000683VI4|5.0|I watched this movie 100xs by myself with family and friends and i have cried each time its not a depressing movie, if you are or not in love that is what people need or want in thier relationship that endless romantic love,racheal mcadams and ryan gosling make this movie so real with thier chemistry between each other, rachel(allie) is so beautiful and ryan(noah) is so so sexy ,also not to forget gena rowland and james garner  are also one of my favorite actresses and actors as well both spectacular. i keep trying to picture other actors and actresses playing these parts and i can honestly say there would be NO OTHERS i would have like to have seen. I thinkg the director and producer did a wounderful job picking the right people to play these parts  th characters of the notebook is just so... beautiful from the begining of this movie to the end is just so beautiful, IF U HAVENT SEEN THIS MOVIE PLEASE GO BUY IT. .. THIS MOVIE WILL BE AND IS A CLASSIC.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This is one of the best dinosuar movies I've ever seen in my whole entire life! The acting and stunts were awesome, and the robotic dinosaurs really rocked my world! Especially the velociraptors! They are, always have been, and always will be my favorite dinosaur  of all time, whether they be in the three Jurassic Park movies or in the late Cretaceous peroid 70 million years ago. This movie was filled with intense action, as well as some funny moments. And the setting, the sheer terror, the design, the savagery-there is almost  no dinosaur movie better than this one. Buy it if you can find it. It is well worth your $25.00.
0792839749|5.0|A Classic! Timeless!  These adjectives go with a movie in which a person of any age could watch and enjoy!  I have experienced this in my own home.  For I grew up watching this movie, and now I get to experience the same joy and laughter with the next generation, and possibly the generation after that!  It's colorful, enjoyable, and it can even teach a few lessons!
B00005JM0B|5.0|This is the best Terminator movie yet! I thought TX was not only a grand villainess, but she also was beautiful and everything an evil terminator should be. I loved the perfect fights and superb tension this film had, and Arnold's second Terminator hero was even better than the one in Terminator 2-Judgement Day(which I own the extreme DVD of, I should add!)There was more humor in this movie than in the first two, as well. Anyway, nuff said! This movie is a must-see for all who like Terminator or any action thrillers!
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Mark Knopfler is one of those guitarists who has the chops to take over a song on the strength of his solos, but to his credit he uses this skill and ability sparingly. As he has aged, his music has matured as well. Shangri-La is the perfect example of how musicians learn as they get older. Knopfler writes on the fringes of autobiography. The songs may be about his life, but you would have to look hard (and make the case for it) if you want personal details. The songs are all wonderful, but as a musician I found his take on Everybody Pays to be right on. It has been postulated that Knopfler has more music than words. This set of songs shows that he is equally gifted in both.
B00008ADPF|5.0|I love Nickelback. It is among my favorite bands. And this is the best Nickelback CD I've ever listened to, so far, at least. How do I rank the songs? Let me show you all in style.  <br /> <br />1. Flat On The Floor 7/10 A great song, but could be a bit longer. <br /> <br />2. Do This Anymore 9/10 Love it. Cool tune and full of feeling. <br /> <br />3. Someday 8/10 Very strong, and well put together. It rocks big.  <br /> <br />4. Believe It Or Not 6/10 Pretty good, but a little too long. <br /> <br />5. Feeling Way Too Damn Good 8/10 A very happy and funny song.  <br /> <br />6. Because Of You 9/10 Cool to the core. And extremely hardcore. <br /> <br />7. Figured You Out 9/10 A song about a love/hate relationship for your ex-girlfriend or girlfriend. Maybe your wife. I don't know. <br /> <br />8. Should've Listened 10/10 A song about what happens when you don't help fix problems with you and your wife. Very powerful. <br /> <br />9. Throw Yourself Away 10/10 Tells what happens in a situation when all luck has betrayed you. At least as far as I can tell.  <br /> <br />10. Another Hole In The Head 8/10 It tells about a guy who has had enough of either his brother or roomate. Or someone else.  <br /> <br />11. See You At The Show 10/10 My favorite song on the album. What a happy ending, what a conclusion, what a melodic song. Yow!!!!!!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This movie is all about guilt. <br /> With a little touch of Hitchcock in the direction, I moved slowly through this movie to find at the end a terrifying tale about a lonely man that most of the people that surrounds him  hate, but you, as the viewer will look at him with empathy. <br /> The film is about a machinist that starts living a nightmare of paranoia and hallucinations but all of it is a contradiction since he has not been able to sleep in a year. I guess that is why the fact of his insomnia leads everyone to see that this is all about guilt.  <br /> Christian Bale is a great actor. One day he will be more recognize for his work. Most of the times, when you see a performance like this; it is link to a movie that was not made to be popular. <br />
B0000A02TZ|5.0|What can I say! This is a perfect movie! It has lots of funny and crude humor, lots of fighting, lots of wonderful quotes, lots of alcoholic beverages, lots of swearing, lots of hot babes stripping, lots of destruction, lots of everything you'd ever dream of in a movie like this! Animal House deserves an Academy Award, or did it already get one? Whatever, I love this movie, and so will you. Oh, and the characters were as hilarious as they should have been, too.
B00005JNJT|5.0|When i went to see this film, i was filled with both hope and fear. I hoped Nolan would make a return to the dark and gritty world that Burton had made in the first two movie, and i feared he had done a \\"Shumacher\\" on the world. Luckily, he had done the first.    Batman is such an intriguing character. He is not a superhero, such as spiderman or superman, he has no powers. So that is the platform that allows Burton and now Nolan to create a more mature storyline, it does not need to be colourful and bright. It is a storyline that is believable to adults.     Burton originally created the dark fairytale, he turned batman from a dark comic book character and turned him into a believable vigilante with a story line that was plausable, if slightly far-fetched. Nolan has now carried on with this approach to the fable, and it can be seen with most of the movie being related to a more modern day issue of drugs, and with the villans in the story not being \\"Supervillians\\", but insted just mortals with a taste for havoc.    Now, when finding out that this chapter is seperate to the former versions of the Burton/Shumacher series, I like many of you were afraid that their work was thrown away(if you can call what Shumacher did work). But then, you will realise that this instalment is no different to \\"Batman\\" or \\"Batman Forever\\". All three of these films were the start of individual views on th franchise. Burton created the dark fairytale that was so chillingly made, while Shumacher made a \\"Child-friendly\\" version, without all the darkness and with the colour, and Jim Carrey. All three directors have taken individual parts in the series. Nolan is createing another darker version, with a much more modern role within it.     However, when i heard that the new film was not linked to the older films, i felt worried that the films would be scrapped from memory, but i will not worry because i have now realised that each director has made his own series, there is already a split withinthe franchise. This was never picked up before because the two series never clashed so obviously as the new film does with the original films.  Thankfully, one of the differences within the stories told is that in Batman Begins, we finally have a good insight into his parents death. Burton chose the Joker, in his human form, would be their killer. However, the batman legend tells us that batman never get vengence from the killer as it is belived he would loose his motivation. Schumacher then tried to tell us that Two face, despite previously a upstanding DA as Harvey Dent and not becoming a psycho killer until years after the murder, killed his parents. He then ran out of the funeral with a red book, through a wood in the rain, before being scared by a solitary bat flying in slow motion. This time, it combats the stupidity of Schmachers version while keeping to the legend, which Burton did not. It is said that it was \\"crime\\" that killed his parents(or at least a man forced to rob and kill through a depression)and that he never got a chance to get vengance for the murder. this means that he wil never loose his motivation. This is finally a plausable explination without disturbing the legend, something the series has always needed.    Overall the legend has been split before between the directors, instead be happy that Nolan has restored the element that has been mising with Schumachers movies, The part that made it a favourite for many people. The darkness and realism that sets it apart from all the other superhero films.
B00005B238|4.0|This movie is absolutely superb! I liked Alien, but this one is even better! The fight scenes were awesome, and Arnold did a great job. Also, Predator himself was stellar and everything an big, evil  space monster should be. I thought his weapons were outstanding and  that his final fight with Arnold was the best part of the movie. And the ways he killed his victims were as juicy as roast lamb! His costume was cool, too. I especially liked the quotes \\"Bleed? I ain't got time to bleed!\\" and \\"You're one ugly motherf***er!\\" You like space monsters or science fiction? You should see this.
0141301155|5.0|I am an avid fan of this book and it will be a story I will read to my children when I'm older. Roald Dahl honestly struck a creative goldmine with his beautifully enchanting vision of the chocolate factory and charming story. Most people know the basic idea of what happens so I'll just say this. This is one of the great children's books that spans generations and will continue to do so for many many years.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is one of the best music CD's I own. I love it to death, and I think Amy Lee is both a good singer and a sexy woman. Now, I know you are wondering how I like each song, so here's my song ratings. <br /> <br />1. Going Under 9/10 Very good tune, awesome lyrics, nuff said. <br /> <br />2. Bring Me To Life 10/10 My first Evanescence song. Very chilling. <br /> <br />3. Everybody's Fool 8/10 A strong song. Shows the sin of betrayal. <br /> <br />4. My Immortal 8/10 I'd give it a 9, but it lacks the hard rock. <br /> <br />5. Haunted 7/10 Very creepy and eerie. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br />6. Tourniquet 8/10 Scary, powerful, and absolutely fear inducing. <br /> <br />7. Imaginary 6/10 Not bad, but some other songs do a better job. <br /> <br />8. Taking Over Me 10/10 All about love and determination. Wicked. <br /> <br />9. Hello 1/10 The worst song on the album. So pathetic, so dumb.  <br /> <br />10. My Last Breath 10/10 This is my favorite Evanescence song of all time! It has power, love, bravery, emotion, and much more.  <br /> <br />11. Whisper 8/10 A great ending to a great CD. Filled with hope and hard rock. Oh, and lots of godlike beings chant at the end.  <br /> <br />This is a wonderful CD, and to anyone who likes Evanescence or hard rock, I recommend this album as highly as Mount Everest.
0553579908|3.0|I just finished Robert Stanek's Ruin Mist Chronicles where the books go from good to very good to great so I was disappointed by this second book in A Song of Ice and Fire. A Clash of Kings is nothing like what I was expecting after the first one which was over-the-top phenominal. I hope the third one is better because this one is middling to fair at best.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is, like, so darn funny! As a matter of fact, it is my second favorite computer animated movie next to Ice Age. It has all sorts of funny and vulgar moments in it, and the characters are well put together. Shrek is both heroic, cool, funny, and everything a big, irritable green ogre should be. Donkey is annoying, but in a funny way. You should've seen the part where he sings, and then he says: \\"And then I ate some rotten berries, man I had some strong gases eking out of my butt that day!\\" It's a classic moment! Oh, and the best part concerning Shrek himself(as far as I'm concerned)is the part where he is with Fiona, and she says: \\"Wait! Where are you going?!\\" and then he replies: \\"Well, I have to save my ass!\\" The catch is, he doesn't mean he needs to save himself, he's referring to the donkey! Get it? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Okay, next we go to Princess Fiona! She is very beautiful as a human, and better looking than most ogres when she turns into an ogress at night. She is very feisty and has terrific karate skills which I enjoyed seeing. Finally, she has a good way of snapping when she needs something. Then there's Lord Farquadd, who is an excellent villain. He is evil and malicious, just like a baddie should be. And he's funny, too. He's so vile, yet he's two feet tall! Remember at the end of the movie where he keeps saying he will be king, he will rule all and he will be master of the world and all that stuff, but then he gets eaten by a dragon, and isn't seen again except inside the dragon! What a terrific part! Absolutely perfect! And what makes it even more humiliating for Farquadd is that he didn't just get eaten by a dragon, but a girl one! Oh, and speaking of Dragon, here is my opinion on her! She has always been my favorite of all characters in the Shrek movie(due to her power, beauty, grace, and of course amazing knack for being funny)and still is to this day. The fact she's a girl makes it even better, for I love the ladies! Oh, back to Shrek! This movie is absolutely wonderful, and gutbustingly funny! And for anyone who likes comedy, computer animation, or fairy tales, I recommend this movie to all of them. Don't wait any longer! See Shrek on DVD as of this day! Go! Now!
1573225517|5.0|First off, I'm not big into fiction so it was itself a miracle that I finished the book and moreso that I really loved it. <br /> <br />As a guy, I was a little appalled that Hornby so cavalierly gave away many of our secrets and insecurities.  This is also what had me laughing through much of the book.  The way he uses memories of youth and the reluctance of adults to become adults to skewer the male psyche was right on the money.  I should say that when I wasn't laughing, I was squirming. <br /> <br />If the book was strictly funny and face-paced due to its immersion in all things pop culture, that would be enough to recommend it.  But the book is also very wise.  Underneath the humor and hipness runs a current of melancholia....the protagonist is getting older and his despair about how his hangups and past experiences are hindering his growth as a human being is something that we can all relate to in some degree.  This undercuurent would be irritating if it resulted in a wallowing in self-pity.  Instead, it was heartening to see Rob take a series of baby steps (and in some cases I mean the tiniest of baby steps) towards growth and becoming a less self-involved human being.  It offers a message at the end that is surprisingly upbeat.
B00008PC2O|5.0|This is an awesome movie! I saw Terminator 2, Judgement Day on DVD once, and it was cool. But I looked at the extra features of this DVD, and I knew without watching it that it was the same film, except a lot better! I loved T-1000, he was a wonderful villain, I loved Arnold's good guy terminator, just as wonderful a hero, and all in all this is one of the best movies I've ever watched on my TV or computer! I recommend it to anyone who's a Terminator fan like I am! Oh, and the acting was perfect, and the battle scenes were so intense you just have to see them!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I was very pleased to find that this Michael Jackson compilation contains the versions as heard on the 45's.  These versions are very hard to find, you could only hear them on the old vinyl 45's but now you get them on this collection with superb CD remastered sound quality. <br />Michael Jackson has some great songs like Thriller, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', but they're a bit long, nothing wrong with that, but some music fans like the short radio edits.  All of Jackson's compilations like History, The Ultimate Collection, and of course the original remastered albums, all contain the long versions.  This compilation gives the listener an alternate version to listen to. <br />This compilation sure is missing some great songs, but they can easily be found on other compilations, however the gems here are the single version of the songs.  You can only find them here. <br />Thanks!!

In dissecting rapid cognition (he prefers this term to intuition), and perception, Gladwell uses his typically engaging and eclectic style.  He employs seemingly disparate studies, anectodes, and reasoning in the service of deconstructing common ways of thinking about first impressions.  For those who disapprove of the eclectic tendency of this book, I challenge you to read and think more carefully about HOW the various characters and stories in the book are connected.  There is much to be gleaned from this approach.   <br /> <br />While Blink does arrive at some general and soft conclusions, Gladwell resists coming to simplistic conclusions just to satisfy academia, corporate america, or lazy readers. (The former two of whom celebrated the tipping point).  I find the book most helpful as a paradigm shifter that introduces the reader to ideas about perception and rapid cognition and identifies related areas of study.  As I mentioned before, corporate America will not find applications for this book as easily as with The Tipping Point.  Academia will not find succinct declarations of new truths to show off with. While these are not problems for me, I'm sure there will be consequences to face from both of these. <br /> <br />In the interest of balance, I did have some problems with Gladwell's usage of the term \\"thin slicing\\" He describes this highly complex mathematical process early  in the book and then uses it so liberally  throughout that it leads the reader to over generalize and consequently misunderstand the term.  I  also had mixed feelings about his treatment of the Diallo murder. The chapter entitled \\"Seven Seconds in the Bronx\\" was powerful, but I felt like there was some forced closure as he attempted to apply his theories here. <br /> <br />Neither of these issues hampered my enjoyment of this book, however, and I highly recommend it. I'm also interested in discussion of it with critics and fans alike.  <br /> <br />- Chenjerai Kumanyika

No former Beatle ever came close to ATMP's quality and quantity in their post-Beatle years, not even Harrison. <br /> <br />Years go by and this is the album I pull out again and again. I think I've listened to it more than the rest of the Beatles discography combined since 1970. I can't think of a higher recommendation than that.

B0001ZMWQO|3.0|Mildly interesting music on this debut album from the current flavor of the month band.  They are derivitive, their sound was ripped off from the Scottish band Josef K among others, yet they're OK.  I didn't turn them off when I heard them on the radio. But they really don't do much for me. Its just more moderately rocking guitar pop with verse chorus verse songwriting and an odd (for pop) rhythmic sensibility. Ooh they have some homoerotic undertones, big deal. Anybody heard of David Bowie or his song \\"John I'm Only Dancing\\"? Bisexual chic was old by 1973. In any case they don't move me much, and they don't make me want to dance. People who gave this five stars (wtf?!?!) are either very easy to please or haven't heard any music from before 2001. Will anyone care when they release their third album? (let alone their second), we'll see.<br /><br />Update 2012<br />Told you so.
B000002GK1|5.0|Badmotorfinger (1991.), Soundgarden's third studio album<br /><br />Soundgarden were one of the great rock acts of the 1990's, achieving widespread popularity by the middle of the decade with the release of the multiplatinum-selling album, 'Superunknown'. However, the reality is that Soundgarden had been around a great deal longer than most people realised, originally forming in the mid-1980's. They were one of the original Seattle bands who started the whole grunge rock concept which would become mainstream in the early 90's. 'Badmotorfinger', Soundgardens' third studio album, released in 1991 was the first big break for the band as it was their first release under a major label, A&M records and what a major label debut it was .....<br /><br />'Badmotorfinger' to put it simply is one of the heaviest albums I own in my collection. Before I bought this album, the only Soundgarden record that I owned was 'Superunknown' and it was one of my favourite albums. To put things in context, I think that 'Badmotorfinger' is BETTER than 'Superunknown', showing really how masterful this album is. This is Soundgarden at their heaviest or even more, it is grunge at its heaviest. With this album, the band combine Led Zeppelin-like sounds with the powerful, sludgy riffs of 70's Black Sabbath to come up with something amazing. The album is dark, uncompromising and angry for the most part and is the perfect thing to listen to if you've had a tense or bad day! This is Soundgarden at their most aggressive and raw - listening to Chris Cornell's screams in some of the songs shows this clearly as does Kim Thayil's powerful riffing right the way through the album. If your expecting the feel of 'Superunknown' with this album I would prepare to be a little disappointed as 'Badmotorfinger' is less comercial, maybe less lyrical and more melodic but is certainly far, far heavier. All in all, it is another one of the finest efforts from the alternative-rock grunge era and is one of the top albums of that exceptional music year, 1991.<br /><br />This monster of an album begins with 'Rusty Cage', a great opener which is more a heavy metal showcase than anything, with powerful bass-lines and furious riffing. The following track is one hell of a song, 'Outshined' is one of the best rock songs of the 1990's. The guitar work is really atmospheric and chilling, coupled with a killer chorus. 'Slaves and Bulldozers' is the epic of the album, rolling in at 7 minutes. Chris Cornell vents his anger in this one, howling at a level that just doesn't seem humanely possible. The bassline played by Ben Shepherd on this song is great and the song has a very dark, Sabbath-like feel to it overall. 'Jesus Christ Pose' is a great track which a clever but complex beginning with some great drumming from Matt Cameron. Next up is 'Face Pollution', a short angst filled rocker with plenty of pacy riffs. Following this is 'Sometimes', another awesome song with a great climatic chorus. The most unusual track on the album has to go to 'Searching With My Good Eye Closed', which has a warped but amusing start where Chris Cornell does a voice over - it blends into a very atmospheric track. After this track fades out, 'Room A Thousand Years Wide' blasts in with some great riffs and some amazing vocals from Cornell and also enter the saxophones which close out the song! 'Mind Riot' is the most poetic song on the album cemented with lusicous riffs. After this is another short song, 'Drawing Flies', fast and furious (what did I say about this album!) with an interesting integration of trumpets at the end. 'Holy Water' follows and this is one of the album's best. Pounding drumming ensues with some entrancing but hard riffs; this song is what Soundgarden is all about. 'New Damage' is a slower, very dark song which is a phenominal album closer with Kim Thayil jamming out some more sludgy Sabbathesque riffs over some rather depressing lyrics from Chris Cornell.<br /><br />'Badmotorfinger' is a juggernaut of the some of the best heavy metal ever. Like I've said above, this album is REALLY heavy but is also very melodic and is never short of a dull moment (although it has plenty of dark ones!). This in my opinion is Soundgarden at their very highest peak (and is also lead singer Chris Cornell's greatest triumph on the vocals) and is a must buy for any fan of alterantive grunge rock or heavy metal in general.ernaut of the some of the best heavy metal ever. Like I've said above, this album is REALLY heavy but is also very melodic and is never short of a dull moment (although it has plenty of dark ones!). This in my opinion is Soundgarden at their very highest peak (and is also lead singer Chris Cornell's greatest triumph on the vocals) and is a must buy for any fan of alterantive grunge rock or heavy metal in general.
B0000214F0|4.0|What can you say about a film like this - and all 155 minutes of it?  I am surprised that Tinto Brass had his name removed from the outer packaging credits, although it is still on the actual movie itself.  The comparison between this and the heavily cut version speaks for itself.  Chiefly it is the imperial bordello scene where Caligula makes the senators wives available for sex that stands out purely on a sexual level.  To be honest, it is no-holds barred sex: fellatio, cunnilingus and actual sex, as one of the actresses mentioned during the documentary sequence from the DVD menu.  Yes, it happened in Rome and that is the reason for the inclusion of graphic sex.  All that aside, the film does accurately deal with Caligula's life, and portrays the character of this evil emperor well.  Malcolm McDowell is well supported by Helen Mirren, Sir John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole et al.  The darkness of the time comes over with a sense of menace, and this is portrayed well by the opening bars of the soundtrack too.  One earlier reviewer mentioned that most, if not all, the women were very hairy.  Well, considering the film was shot in 1979 when underwear that one might say preferred women to shave their intimate parts was not readily available, if at all, then that comes as no surprise.  For me, I much prefer hairy women anyway.  I would imagine that this version of the film, given its content, would only be available in the UK directly in licensed sex shops, but that is another matter.  If you can take what is served up, then you are in for a gripping, thrilling but rather unnerving evening.
006097625X|2.0|I've taken a look at some of the 5 star reviews, and many of them are people who don't read comics. The short of this review is if you're into comics/comix/sequential art now, and have read some of the cream of the independent crop's works: Kochalka, Thompson, Moore, or work on a similar level, then this book IS NOT FOR YOU! This is a justification, a plea to be taken serious, to those that consider themselves too good for comics. That being said:    Pros: McCloud knows his stuff, he's obviously intelligent, and his love of comics is palatable. Towards the end, he engages in a revelatory, and revelrous, exposition on comics, their virtues, their potential, and what they offer the artistic world as a whole. Comics can do this, do that, they can reach back in time to the Aztecs, and even to prehistoric times. Most books on comics begin a history of comics at just before the turn of the century with the \\"Yellow Kid\\" and his compatriots in \\"Hoogans' Alley\\" (sp?). Which is fair, considering, for all intents an purposes, that's is where modern comics began. McCloud takes it further, arguing that pictures (and some words as well) juxtaposed in a sequence has been used to tell stories as far back as ancient Egypt and Aztec times continuing through medieval times, and places the seed of modern comics in the mid-1800's, with Rodolphe Topffer, the first to use a series of pictures and borders to tell a story.    It's pretty obvious from the start that McCloud is concerned with comics being considered a legitimate artform, and makes connections with works by Max Ernst, Lynd Ward and Frans Masereel to defend this point. These artists created comics (at least comics according to McCloud's definition) and were considered masterpieces, but many people continue to poo-poo comics as pulp and drivel. McCloud makes other connections between comics and other 'fine art' movements, such as comparing 'zip-ribbons', used to convey motions in comic with experiments of dynamic motion on a stationary canvas done by Duchamp and the Futurists (never made this connection, it was kind of cool to discover that.)    Also, he touches on the differences between Japanese and Western comics (and to a lesser extent, American and European comics) which I also found very interesting and wish he had spent more time discussing.    Cons: A lot of this book feels very overwrought and padded. The entire last chapter in which he discusses the process of creating art, could have been cut out without losing any of the books essence, in fact, I would have prefered the space been used in examining the different courses that comics have taken in the various cultures (American, European, Japanese, Latin American). In addition, I found that, with the exception on what I mentioned above, I didn't learn anything new after reading these books. I wasn't introduced to any radical new way of approaching comics or deeper understanding of how they worked. Most of what McCloud talks about, especially the chapters on time, motion, the one on iconic images, the one on closure and the chapter on scripting. I already knew from studying Foxtrot, Calvin & Hobbes and Garfield in the comics section when I was 12-years old, or through multiple readings of my cousins comic and my own Mad Magazine collection; McCloud gives better explanations than I probably could have, but I still just skipped over these sections.    I also skipped over the parts when he brought in charts. I don't know if the image plane triangle is an accepted art world convention (with 'The Picture Plane\\", Meaning and Resemblance at its 3 vertices) but I was really bored by it, the same with the graph depicting the scene-to-scene breakdown of various comics. I suppose some people would find these 'visual aids' useful. But, they're more superfluous than anything else. Like disecting a Christmas card and concluding which figure is the father, the mother, etc. It's so painfully obvious and tedious that you can't help but groan through the process. Case in point: some people may find it useful, but it just seemed like it was missing the point, in order to make those charts and graphs you drain whatever life was in the comics, out and you just have this fragile husk to measure against that ultimately means nothing. It's like phrenology for art.      Mccloud wants comics to be taken seriously, and through this book he's trying to convince the 'layperson' of how artistically viable they are, creating (essentially) mathematical equations to say \\"Look! This formula shows that you should appreciate comics because they are mathematically equal to works of fine art, but with words!\\" In the process of trying to make his case, though, I think he misses a lot of unquantifiable things that make comics so enjoyable and timeless, their universal approachability and spontaneity.    This was written in 1992, before the huge surge in underground/alternative comics that we're enjoying today. So, McCloud's predictions came true, though it's probable they would have regardless of whether this book was published or not. A great many comic artists have praised McCloud, I guess because he's legitimized the medium now. If McCloud is responsible at all for greater acceptance of comics, and for turning more people on to comics, then he deserves some kudos. However, his books aren't for fans/longtime readers of comics, they're for the older cantankerous coots that never took them seriously.    I much prefer Eisner's \\"Comics and Sequential Art\\" which is much less pretentious and a much more enjoyable read. Many of the things McCloud attempts to cover and address in \\"Understanding Comics\\" are addressed in \\"Comics...\\" with much more focus and clarity. Though a different beast, I also found \\"Comic Book Nation\\" by Bradford W. Wright too be very entertaining and interesting. It traces modern comics' evolution and the impact they've had on American culture; from juvenile delinquency trials and indecency charges, to Quentin Tarantino.
B0009P42S2|4.0|My biggest problem with this movie is the boy, Ray, is voiced by a woman. And it sounds like he's voiced by a woman. They should have gotten a child actor to do the voice if that's what they were going for. Not a female actress.<br /><br />That said, the story is great but it drags on a bit long. The animation is just beautiful and everything is top notch.
B000002B7O|5.0|I read all these reviews below and so i bought both the 95 remaster and the 24bit one and let me tell you just buy this 24 bit remaster it sounds so much better who frikin cares about drummers and the stupid royalties the 95 version cannot even compete with this. stop listining to egotistical fools and ones who are stuck on the old cr*p and buy what sounds better this sounds far better!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed Firefly when it originally aired on Fox, and only gave it a try because it was Joss Whedon, and I was out of things to rent on Netflix. I was in love from the pilot episode on. This is science fiction for the rest of us: those sick of action driven, control-fantasy, politically-cliche SF. Firefly is character-drive science fiction. It is witty, and clever, and if you think the storylines are lacking, you're clearly missing the underlying character development. <br /> <br />     To Pancake Repairman, do some research into the history of 19th century (and earlier) courtesans. You will find that the notion of a specialized class of elite prositutes is neither confrontational, nor ridiculously juvenile, but historically grounded and viable. I'll also point out that the only people treating Inara with much respect are her customers: both Mal's and Shepard Book's interactions with her suggest that her profession is controversial and clearly not accepted by everyone. To C. Chow, who suggested the Inara's role was clearly only for sex appeal, and that she served no other purpose, I can wonder if you watched the series through. There is clearly a deeper, important storyline between she and Mal, each expanding the other's storyline in a specific way. If Inara seems unimportant, it was only because the series was cancelled before Joss had time to develop her story at a liesurely, natural pace. Each character on this show is designed to play up and play off some characteristic of another. <br /> <br />     This is space opera; this is character drama. If you're looking for another humanoid-alien-culture-of-the-week-in-need-of-human-aid series, flip back over to the Sci-Fi Channel. If you want something different, something fresh, and you dig romanticized action-adventure, rent/buy this DVD and be in awe! <br /> <br />     Firefly's value has nothing to do with Dark Angel, or its cancellation. No point posting negative reviews because of it. Obviously, good shows get cancelled all the time. Blame the network, not the other victims.
B0006284JQ|1.0|(...)please add 0 star rating please, this cd isn't worth a star!!! Wow, the only good thing about this cd is the cover, but don't let the cover fool you!!!

0671510991|4.0|In order to fully appreciate this book, I think you should temporarily suspend your feelings about Kissinger as a Secretary of State and consider him as Kissinger the historian. Once you've finished, you can them bring in all of what you know of his controversial career. I found this book extremely helpful and insightful. Kissinger goes through much of the history of \\"Western\\" (i.e. European) diplomacy, from the Peace of Westphalia to the fall of the Soviet Union (it was originally published in 1994, and hence is out of date, though two areas Kissinger predicted as being important have mainfested themselves-fundamentalist Islam and China). His thesis or perspective throughout is that international relations and diplomacy are in equilibrium when all nations strive to address properly their national interest and balance that against the national interest of their adversaries (this intepretation of international relations has often been called realism). Kissinger does not put much stock in the moral prounouncements of men like President Woodrow Wilson, who believe that peace is the norm, and not the exception of IR. He instead admires Teddy Roosevelt and Richard Nixon. Despite what you may think of the overarching framework, this is an excellent history covering every conceivable facet of diplomatic history. I was especially impressed with his chapters on World War II and Franklin Roosevelt (who is the President I most admire; I was surprised at the amount of credit Kissinger, who is always deemed a \\"conservative\\" gave to FDR, the quintessential liberal). The only downside to the book is its length (over 800 pages paperback) and Kissinger's writing style, which is filled with large words not suitable to every reading level. If, for example, you don't know what inchoate means, I would suggest having a dictionary handy. Overall, a good read for wanna be historians and international relations experts.
0446613444|4.0|Black Ice is another well-constructed Harry Bosch novel. Harry, an outsider detective within his own department, cannot accept convenient coincidences or inconsistencies. He is forever on the lookout for situations that are painted or constructed to be what they are not. This skepticism is exactly what is needed on Christmas night when Harry intercepts radio traffic about a death in a seedy motel room in his district while he is on call. But Assistant Chief Irving has rushed to the scene and quickly concludes, too quickly for Harry's liking, that the death of narcotics detective Cal Moore is a suicide - end of story.<br /><br />But Harry finds several cases that seem to be much too conveniently attached to Moore, suggesting that Moore may have been a target. Bosch almost methodically pieces together the connections. The evidence in all the cases finally points to a drug operation involving black ice in Mexicali, Mexico. Harry has to use all of his expertise in surviving this case.<br /><br />The Black Echo and The Black Ice are too very good entries into this genre. There are some references to the first book, but not overly so. With the creation of Bosch and his complex, well-paced stories, Connelly's success is unsurprising.
B0000DCGT4|3.0|Review #172. Good comedy sequel to 'American Pie 2'. Many hilarious twists and turns here. The fun starts when Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) asks his girl friend Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan) to marry him. As most of you remember, the two met up at band camp. Wise-ass Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) tries (and succeeds) to impress the heck out of Michelle's parents and younger sister. Most memorable scene is when Stifner and the gang show up in Chicago, unknowingly at a gay bar where he ends up having a 'dance off' with bar patron (Brad Hammer). Another one is where 'ol Stifner winds up eating a piece of dog poop while he avoids Michelle's mother finding out that the item he was holding was NOT a bar of chocolate. One more: when 'ol Stifner is tricked into 'personally servicing' Jim's 80 year-old grandma. Outrageously funny! Worth watching.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|If you haven't been able to tell from all the reviews, you're either going to think this is the best movie of all time or you're going to wonder why you wasted your money.  I personally think the movie was great.  It's definately a unique film.  How often do you get to see a curly-headed dweeb yell at his grandma's llama and throw food at her?  I think it basically just depends on the type of person you are as to whether or not you'd like the movie.  Maybe you haven't noticed, but all the people who give the movie 1 star tend to criticize other people's reviews for missing commas, misspelled words and other crap like that.  One person said his crap told him better stories if that tells you anything. They also seem to think that a nerd is the same thing as a retard (and aren't afraid to rag on people who are mentally handicapped), and they use the two terms retard and nerd interchangably.  The majority of these people seem to be incredibly uptight.  They are right about one thing though... this movie has next to no plot.  The personality, or lackthereof, of the characters makes up for it though.  This movie isn't one that provokes deep, meaningful thoughts.  It's just a light, simple comedy.  People should lighten up and take it as such.  Go ahead and try it though, you'll love it...or maybe not.
B00005JKJA|2.0|I'm no stranger to slow pacing or difficult plots, but I have never sat through a movie so excruciatingly boring as this one.  Even if there is a twisted and mirrored truth in this movie, it's certainly not worth the 2 and a half hours to figure it out.  Save yourself the agony.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|The title says it all.  Nothing new in the flick, and Keanu, well is Keanu ..... boring and droll.  Lots of CGI stuff, but nothing you have not seen before.  I suggest that you not waste your time or money on this film.
B000646MNE|5.0|The only bad part about watching this series, is the fact that it will break your heart to see it end. Sarah Jessica Parker and her friends make up a tight bonded group. If you don't have kids you will probably be able to watch this with a more carefree attitude that this is for entertainment only and really can be outrageous and sexually shocking at times, but hilarious and brilliant through and through.<br /><br />My advice - don't skip around - start at season one and watch straight through to the end.
B000002C25|5.0|The more I listened to this album... the better it got. I am a huge Oasis fan, and this along with Definitely Maybe are the 2 albums I enjoy most from them. D'you know what I mean, the first song is a great way to introduce the album and is flat out a great offering. Stand by me, Don't go away and All around the world are also excellent songs from the album, very radio friendly and these are songs that will be favourties to most on the album. However the song that I think is head and shoulders above all else and one of the band's best songs is I hope, I think, I know. Catchy tune, great lyrics. A must buy album for any Oasis fan!!!
B00005JNTX|2.0|The visuals are great but the endless worship of violence is sick and pointless.
B00007LTIA|4.0|If you like Yes, chances are you will like \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans.\\" If you don't like Yes, nothing I can say will persuade you. In fact, why are you even reading this? For those who like Yes, but have not heard \\"Tales,\\" one can say that the album is a typical double album from a major group: it contains some of the best material the band produced, but is also too long and overly ambitious. The Beatles' \\"White Album\\" and The Who's \\"Tommy\\" contained great music as well as some forgettable filler. At around eighty minutes, \\"Tales\\" also is too much for anyone's head at first listen. As with \\"Tommy,\\" it needs to be digested slowly. With its four twenty-minute songs, \\"Topographic Oceans\\" doesn't have the soloing breaks or radio-friendly song structure one finds on \\"Roundabout.\\" Yet, I found its instrumentation more balanced and complementary than that found on most Yes albums. No one hogs the spotlight. Howe and Wakeman are more subdued than usual, but drummer Alan White--no doubt eager to please on his first album with Yes--makes an impressive debut. \\"Tales\\" sounds much more straight-forward than some of the band's other albums, and is not as exhausting, indeed, not nearly as headache-inducing, as other prog-rock classics such as \\"Thick as a Brick\\" or \\"Tarkus\\" (also good, but very different from \\"Tales\\"). Rather than providing a musical showcase for Yes's talented instrumentalists, the album focuses its attention on Anderson's vocals and his preoccupation with mystical themes. Anderson's lyrics have always been a bit too opaque for me, but the harmonies are nice. The first song, with its catchy melody, is the album's best. Unfairly derided for representing the most self-indulgent and pretentious tendencies of progressive rock, critics have long reviled \\"Tales\\" (though the new Rolling Stone Record Guide shows that it might be getting new respect). For those who like prog-rock, however, \\"Tales\\" is an essential album. I have heard the album a few times, but don't feel that I have absorbed all there is to enjoy. This is one of those albums that stands up to, indeed demands, repeat listening.el that I have absorbed all there is to enjoy. This is one of those albums that stands up to, indeed demands, repeat listening.
B00005JNSK|3.0|Charlie And The Chocolate Factory was quite an acceptable movie. Johnny Depp was fantastic as Willy Wonka, as was Charlie, Charlie's Grandpa, Charlie's family and most of the other kids who win golden tickets. The movie has also been updated well for today's audiences. Unfortunately that is also the biggest fault. For my personal tastes it is ever so slightly too cynical, therein losing the magic. It's a little too real for my liking, but that may appeal to some. I guess you should make up your own mind. Either way, definitely worth checking out.
B00005JNSK|5.0|YES, i belive so.  Many people would say this is a film where some scenes made no sense and some were completely unnecessary.  I on the other hand think that Willie Wonka's flash backs were important. <br /> <br />The flash backs showed why cany making was so prudent to him.  All his life he was not allowed to eat chocolate, when he did eat some he wanted more (naturally). His father didn't like the idea of his son eating chocolateso Willie ran away.  All the while we learn his father kept Willie on his mind. He saved newspaper articles and whatched his child's buisness grow.  I think those flashbacks were important because it showed why he started making candy in the first place. <br /> <br />Also, i think the casting was amazing.  In my opinion, Johnny Depp really is the perfect Willie Wonka.  He portrayed the other side of Wlllie Wonka we didn't see in the original.  Plus, in the newer version Willie Wonka seemed more real.  He was also very witty and funny.  And i loved that he was creepy at some points during the film. The kids were also very good.  I think this movie really went deeper with the characters.  For example, Veruca, right after she got the golden ticket, said she wanted a pony.  Thats shows more of how spioled she was.  Violet was shown as a winner and never a loser. All of her trophies showed that.  It was also shown that her and her mother were very much alike.   <br /> <br />The songs in this newer movie were wonderful.  I never liked the original songs and i was hopeing they didnt use them in this version.  Some of the characters thought the songs seemed choriograghed, which made it even more real ( the movie) <br /> <br />I also like the all etible room.  Willie Wonka explained that everything in this room was eatible.  Even, to my suprise, himself. To give that comic relief he pointed out however that that would be canniblism. * very funny* in my opnion. <br /> <br />Tim burton, in whom i love, is a great film maker.  his films are twisted, yes, but that is who he is.  I think This version was very much better.  I could not stand to watch the original, but i can now watch this new version all day long.   <br /> <br />If you want the real Willie Wonka buy the new version because this goes into greater depth with the characters. <br /> <br />I may only be 14 but i know what i am saying.  This version is WAY BETTER!
0380973464|5.0|Cryptonomicon is one of the very best books I have read.  The primary story is interesting enough in itself, following two generations of Waterhouses, the grandfather Lawrence contributing to the allies decryption efforts during WWII, and the grandson Randy working with modern day cryptography.   <br /> <br />Much of Lawrence's WWII story has been told before, but likely never quite so entertainingly, or with such a unique and quirkily  nerdy character in the lead.  Lawrence Waterhouse is a true scientist and academician at heart, a person completely consumed by his thirst for knowledge, and even more so by his drive to solve problems.  This story easily transitions between European locations during the earlier parts of the war, and then moves on to Australia, southeast Asia, the Philippines and Japan.  The brutalities the Japanese dealt to their enemies are hair-raising, but Stephenson keeps everything grounded and humane.  We get a feel for the differences in culture that may have lead some Nipponese to such brutalities, and can perhaps better understand (if not forgive) some of the war's worst moments. <br /> <br />Randy Waterhouse is a nerd, but lacks the overwhelming drive of his grandfather, perhaps a good general analogy for the two eras.  Even so, Randy's story is entertaining, existing mainly in southeast Asia.  We learn much that is fascinating about modern cryptography, its potential and possibilities.  Stephenson intertwines both stories with energy and focus. <br /> <br />The key to my elevating Crytonomicon to the very best of books, even so, are the huge number of amazing allegories and inventions Stephenson intersperses throughout the book.  There are many of these that would be worth reading the book all its own.  An early example is Stephenson's making an analogy of the Enigma machine to the spokes and chain on a bicycle. In a clear and entertaining manner, Stephenson shows how missing spokes on the main sprocket, combined with broken links on thebike's chain has direct analogy to the Enigma encryption method.  After six pages of this, I felt that I kind of understood what was going on with this complex subject; amazing. <br /> <br />Probably the funniest part of the book is an extended discussion of Lawrence Waterhouse's self-analysis of his sex drive.  Turns out, Waterhouse finds that he cannot concentrate on solving decryption problems (or much of anything else) if he has had no sexual release for a defined period of time.  He writes out equations, and makes graphs plotting his rise in sexual tension, and his resultant lack of effectiveness in his work.  Once he manages a requisite release--and he finds a variety of these--his ability to break codes for the allies skyrockets.  As typical for Lawrence, he has considered every contingency, and comes to a workable solution.  Workable, that is, until he meets Mary.  Mary, who will become his future wife and true love.  Waterhouse has a heck of a time including true love into his analysis, and he finally invents a Mary_proximity_factor (mpf).  Does including this new factor work?  Read the book, and have a lot of fun finding out. <br /> <br />There are many other such excursions and inventions, and nearly all of them work.  They wow and entertain.  They show a level of knowledge and skill in essaying complex subjects in lay terms that is very uniquely Stephenson. <br /> <br />One last example:  Toward the end of the book, where the story elements are naturally converging, and we are seriously anticipating how all will be resolved, Stephenson goes off into far left field.  Suddenly, and with no segway, we are learning about Randy Waterhouse's experiences, many years earlier, in getting his wisdom teeth pulled.  Initially, I wondered what the heck was Stephenson doing; the book is rather long, and I was anxious to see how he would conclude the various plot lines.  Turns out, for Randy anyway, having wisdom molars extracted is similar to true love.  How Stephenson manages to make this work, you'll have to read to find out.  But I will remember this section of the book for a long, long time.  Not because it is so profound, but rather for the moment and place it was introduced in the story, how odd and unexpected it was, and how well it worked at that point.   <br /> <br />Cryptonomicon is like that: strange, inventive, surprising, regularly amazingly amazing, and satisfying in the extreme.  Huge thanks to Neal Stephenson for providing this wonderful and unique book.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|Five high school students who are representative of well-known stereotypes--the princess (Molly Ringwald), the brain (Michael Anthony Hall), the athlete (Emilio Estevez), the basket case (Ally Sheedy), and the criminal (Judd Nelson)--are sentenced to all-day Saturday detention in the school library together.  Wanting nothing to do with each other, they nevertheless begin to interact and, by the end of the day, they have learned a great deal about themselves and the others, completely shattering the concept of a stereotype.      There's a 5-star movie here screaming to get out, as exemplified by the wonderful scene in which the kids just sit down on the floor and talk about themselves and challenge each others assumptions.  It's hampered by many lesser elements, such as one-dimensional adult characters and silly posing (such as the MTV flavored dance scenes, which are unrealistic and painfully bad).  Nevertheless, the excellent performances and that basic core of honesty about high school that manages on occasion to rise powerfully above the formula rescue the film./
0385338686|1.0|I am a huge fan of Sophie's Shopaholic series & \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\", but this one is a complete waste of good paper. <br /> <br />Take Becky Bloomwood, remove the shopping addiction and just change her job description to that of \\"lawyer\\", and here you have the basis for the heroine of the novel Samantha Sweeten.   <br /> <br />The notion that a successful attorney wants to give up their career just because they are suffering from burnout and turns to housekeeping as an outlet is a bad one.  It's even more irritating to read that even though she has the opportunity to take control of her life she never really does.  The book would have ended far better if Samantha somehow managed to change her work environment to suit her needs better instead of just running away from it again.   <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|<br />While I'll agree with the reviewer below who says in effect, nobody does Enya better than Enya, I do take issue with calling this \\"Elevator Music.\\"  <br /> <br />This is a really nice CD. The women have beautiful voices and they sing a myriad of songs from Irish \\"standards\\" to new-age Celtic to some traditional Gaelic ballads.  <br /> <br />I find it possible to prefer Enya's version of \\"May It Be\\" while still wanting to listen to the version sung by the Celtic Woman group.  <br /> <br />And while \\"Danny Boy\\" may not be pure Celtic is it certainly an enjoyable tune and they sing it well. Why nitpick about semantics? They are a nice group with nice music.  <br /> <br />I'm not a music prude, I like \\"Flogging Molly\\" as much as the next person, but lets face it, they are completely different kinds of music. When I'm in the mood for Irish rock I'll put on FM. When I want to relax I'll put on CW. It's that simple.  <br /> <br />
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is loaded with Linkin Park's best songs.  \\"Papercut,\\" \\"One Step Closer,\\" \\"Crawling,\\" and \\"In the End\\" lead the way in the album.  \\"In the End\\" is my personal favorite, and it is a favorite of the radio, as this song is the most played song on the radio by Linkin Park.  Chester Bennington has great vocals and Mike Shinoda does a good job rapping; and I am not a fan of rap at all.  Linkin Park's music is fantastic; they are loaded with talent and know how to use it, and because of that have raised the bar of rock by one level.  It is hard to combine rap and rock together, but they somehow do it and do it well.  Rock on Linkin Park, you have done well.
B000084T18|3.0|There has been a huge commercial buzz over this album. If you're interested in this because of In Da Club, then you ain't no rap fan. Peep this: <br /> <br />-01-INTRO (just indicating he's gonna b rich) <br />-02-WADDUP GANGSTA ft. LLOYD BANKS-4/5 (i dont no y everybody hates this song, but its not a perfect 5 bcuz of it being close to being a club song) <br />-03-PATIENTLY WAITING ft. EMINEM-3/5 (it just aint that good...) <br />-04-MANY MEN (WISH DEATH)-5/5 (PERFECT! standout track, he actually talks about somethin here) <br />-05-IN DA CLUB-0/5 (dont get me started, this track marks 50's downfall... just compare this one to any track from Guess Who's Back? then ull realize that theres no arguing about my decision) <br />-06-HIGH ALL THE TIME-3.5/5 (just another I Need Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed song) <br />-07-HEAT-5/5 (great song, this is hardcore rap, 50's old ways) <br />-08-IF I CAN'T-4.5/5 (nice, but i like the remix with jay-z more) <br />-09-BLOOD HOUND-0/5 ft. TONY YAYO (i think)(this also marks  <br />50's downfall) <br />-10-BACK DOWN-4/5 (i like this one) <br />-11-P.I.M.P-0/5 (another downfall marker, gives the impression that hes a porn-obssessed freak) <br />-12-LIKE MY STYLE ft. YING YANG TWINS-1/5 (once again, 50's originality fades away) <br />-13-POOR LIL' RICH-5/5 (NICE! hard to listen to the chorus though) <br />-14-21 QUESTIONS ft. NATE DOGG-5/5 (not his style, but i like it, dammit!) <br />-15-DON'T PUSH ME ft. EMINEM-3/5 (starts to get boring) <br />-16-GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN-4.5/5 (y'all gon' feel this one) <br /> <br />there are loads more tracks on my version. an alright album, but i seriously reccommend these great 50 cent albums: <br />-Guess Who's Back? <br />-Power Of The Dollar <br />Forget The Massacre or Beg For Mercy. Check out The Hunger For More by Lloyd Banks.

B00005JKDR|4.0|Now their won't be anymore reasons to be afraid of monsters in the closet! This is a great movie for kids, my daughter loves it! Our heroine, Boo, shows that their may in fact BE a monster in your closet, but there is no reason to be afraid of it. I recommend this film to anyone with kids, and even those of us that are just young at heart! Pixar did an excellent job on this one,... but don't they always?!
B000069CWE|3.0|The remixes for the first 5 tracts are what drags this entire album by at least one star.  Linkin Park can easily hold its own, on its own, and it does not need remixes to reinforce that fact.  However, not all the songs are busts.  \\"Pushing me Away,\\" is better remixed than it is in its original form in Hybrid Theory.  They completely destroyed \\"In the End,\\" probably my favorite Linkin Park song.  There are a few new songs on here, but they do not make too big an impact on the whole album.
0792162803|5.0|I love this movie! I bought it so I could watch it whenever I need a good laugh. It doesn't have a dull moment in the whole movie. Superstar is definately a \\"LOL\\" film. The characters are well chosen, and play their parts great. And who could refuse yet another movie with Will Ferrel?! All in all, I give \\"Superstar\\" a Super Star! No pun intended! <br /> <br /> <br />                          <br />                            <br />
B00008H2LB|4.0|Once again, Linkin Park has created another album worth owning.  To those who critize this album or Linkin Park's talent in general, you do not know good music when you hear it.  Linkin Park's style changes in some songs, the most noticeable being \\"Nobody's Listening.\\"  Linkin Park misses on that one, and I kind of think the forward is a little unnecessary.  Other than that, Linkin Park scores on just about everything else.  My favorite tracks are \\"Breaking the Habit\\" and \\"Numb.\\"  \\"From the Inside\\" is really well done too.  Overall, another good album by Linkin Park that is worth owning.
B00007KWHP|5.0|This album was one of my father's favorites and it got played a lot when he was cleaning or cooking.  I love this album because of the memories and the great classic rock music.  Very highly recommended if you love classic rock masterpieces!!  I think this is better than Pink Floyd etc..etc. <br />Buy It!  You won't be sorry!!!
B00003CX8N|5.0|What a perfect jewel of a movie! The first time I watched it, I felt as if I'd just been given a wonderful gift. This is a quiet film - not action or \\"event\\" driven, so it relies on the wonderful, nuanced performances of the leads. Although secondary characters come and go, it is Anne Bancroft as Helene Hanff and Anthony Hopkins as Frank Doel who do the heavy lifting and the results are perfect. I couldn't agree more with what reviewer Brockeim said: \\"Neither character has an agenda\\" and this is one of the things that makes them so appealing to watch. <br /> <br />To the best of my recollection, \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" is remarkably faithful to the book (a rarity in movies, I think) and if you loved the book, you'll be pleased by the way the characters come to life in the movie. Even though I knew how the book ended, the tears that came at the end of the movie caught me by surprise - it's just that well-acted. A treat for anyone who loves a good film, but an extra-special treat for any book lover. It's my favorite rainy day movie. <br />
B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin's 5th album, Houses of the Holy is most definitely one of the greatest albums of all time, released in 1973. It's quite possibly my favorite Led Zeppelin album, but they are all so amazing.  <br />     <br />  \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is an amazing and happy song, an epic. Whatever you do, crank the whole album up when you listen to it.  <br />     <br />  \\"The Rain Song\\", one of my favorites, is an amazingly beautiful song, and is pretty much guaranteed to give you shivers if you have it at the right volume, especially on the middle part, where Robert delivers amazing vocals, as usual. It's also the only Zeppelin track where Bonzo uses brushes to drum. Jimmy definitely expresses his genius songwriting and use of alternate tunings with the beautiful guitar in this song.  <br />    <br />  \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" is also a very amazing song, and will also definitely give you shivers from the moment those first four overdriven chords sound. Robert then shares his wisdom through his amazing high-pitched vocals. Really awesome song, also gets pretty good radio play.  <br />     <br />  \\"The Crunge\\" starts out with a very short bit of barely audible studio chatter, followed by Bonham's explosive drum intro and Jonesy's funky bass line. This song is certainly very different from any Zeppelin before it, especially Plant's vocals, and later JPJ's synthesizer work. You might or might not like this song, but I love it. Every great band experimented with different types of music.  <br />     <br />  \\"Dancing Days\\" is also a very different song. I love everything about this song, from the catchy guitar riff to the great synthesizer parts. Really awesome song, one of my favorites. <br />     <br />  \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" is a real catchy reggae-ish song, which I believe Zeppelin pulled off perfectly. It's a very emotional song, with Robert's soulful voice and some awesome drums too. <br />    <br />  \\"No Quarter\\" is an amazingly awesome and eerie song. It startsout with Jonesy's spooky expert organ playing. Page's guitar riff is extremely catchy, one of the first Zeppelin songs I learned, and Plant's vocals fit the mood perfectly. There is an awesome solo part with organ and Page doing a fiery guitar solo. The end is where the song really kicks into overdrive with Plany sort-of vocal soloing, with his high-pitched wailing finally coming into the song. <br />     <br />  \\"The Ocean\\" begins with Bonham talking, leading into the infectiously catchy guitar riff, with the bass doing the same thing. From the soaring vocals, amazing guitar work, awesome drums, really cool backing vocals, the acapella middle part, to the extremely upbeat \\"doowop\\" finale, this is an amazing song. \\"Ohh, so good!\\" <br /> So yeah, definitely buy this album now if you don't have it yet. It's one of the greatest albums ever from the greatest band in the universe. If you're just getting into Zeppelin, you should get the albums in order, but it definitely won't hurt to start with this.  <br />
B0009P42S2|2.0|I will not repeat the details of the plot here. As the film starts, you're drawn into its alternate world where everything is powered by steam. The machines are fascinating!<br /><br />There's no clear delineation of good and evil - apart, perhaps, from the armaments companies, who turn London into a disaster area for demo purposes. Unless, of course, you have the naive view that we'll all live in peace if people would just stop inventing and selling weapons ... which, unfortunately, might be the message some will take away from this movie, never having learned the lessons of history.<br /><br />Anyway. The animation and scenery and creativity are superb. However, once the destruction starts, you lose all possibility of belief, since the scale of destruction is so vast. No arms dealers would dare put on such a show in such a location. It's supposed to show the destructive power of science in the wrong hands, but it reaches ridiculous proportions.<br /><br />After about the halfway mark, you sense that it's gone on long enough, and you're just waiting for it to be over. Too many shots of steam pipes leaking and exploding, etc., too long to wrap up. If you have the patience, a lot of the imagery is awe-inspiring, though. But at the end you don't really care any more.
0345456343|5.0|I got this book with only knowing about the moive Interview with the Vampire.  When I started to read the book I couln't put it down.  All 3 of the books are the same way.  I like The Vampire Lestat the best.  In The Vampire Lestat she goes more in to the history of vampire.  Then with ending that will make you want to read The Queen of the Damned right away.  The Vampire Chronicles is one of the best series out there. If you havn't read it you are missing out.   <br />
B000006NUW|5.0|Motown doesn't get the respect that, say Atlantic or Stax/Volt got in the 60s; \\"not black enough\\", whatever that's supposed to mean, is the usual criticism from Rock Snobs. They just miss the point. <br /> This box has the greatest dance music ever made, thanks to the immortal rhythm section of Benny Benjamin and James Jamerson. If the songs don't make you get up, then you must be dead. <br />Oh, the songs... well you know most of them by heart. You do, don't you? \\"Money\\", \\"Shop Around\\", \\"Baby Love\\"... heck I knew over 80 out of the 104 songs before I bought this. Holland/Dozier/Holland and Smokey Robinson wrote the bulk of them, cranking out hit after hit like Detroit used to crank out Thunderbirds. <br /> As for the artists, it's still amazing that ONE LABEL had the Supremes, Temptations, Four Tops, Martha & the Vandellas, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye. And even they didn't get all the best songs. Jimmy Ruffin's \\"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\\" is THE saddest song in the world and one of the greatest. <br /> Now I'm sure some of you out there are holding back because every song's in mono. Well that's how records were made back then, for AM radio. All you have to do is crank up the volume  and be prepared to be blown away by some of the most propulsive music ever captured for the ages.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|As always these guys show their genius.  This page seems to have turned into some sort of Dream Theater discussion, to which i am sure i will be criticised for adding to!  Dream Theater are not and have not ever been easy listening, but they are unsurpassed in giving such pure satisfaction and a feeling of longing for the next album.  Why they should be controlled by anyone is beyond me and noone would thank them for showing the restraint that was enforced on Falling into Infinity, itself probably unparalleled in terms of fantastic songwriting suppressed by a record label.  This album expands on their already celestial reportoire and I for one cannot wait to see their live interpretation of what is a fantastic studio album.  I hope there are many years and many more albums coming from these guys!!!
0671027387|1.0|I am an avid fiction reader and was hoping that this book will be at least OK, considering that it is written by Dan Brown. I was disappointed, to say the least. The plot is OK and some of the situations in the book are built up really well, but overall this book totally sucks. There are some instances where the author has gone way way too far off the main plot, rambling incessantly. Some of the prose is so silly that it makes you laugh.<br /><br />Overall, a very amateur-ish attempt by the author which is best avoided. Go for Angels and Demons or Da Vinci Code by the same author.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Why not? Well, because I'm never going to buy a copy protected CD. Not that it stops pirates anyway, just people who like their music their way. Sorry Foo Fighters, I might have missed a classic there. Still, your \\"revenue is protected\\", just another $16 less than it could be...
B0009HLDFU|2.0|Yes, i am a foo fighters fan, rating \\"nothing left to lose\\" as one of my favourite albums ever, but this album was an amazing flop to my ears, on the heavier CD, there are just no \\"tunes\\", \\"best of you\\" is a poor and formulaic four chord piece of weener rock and the other songs, average in their riffdom and choruses, fail to leave landmarks such as \\"hero\\" \\"learn to fly\\" or \\"everlong\\" did. <br /> <br />things improve with disc 2, some pleasant chords but to be honest when we have amazing stuff like tweaker and bjork these days, these vaguely pretty songs fail to mark aswell <br /> <br />go back to the drawing board foo fighters, fame has gone to your heads, give us another \\"godzilla\\" before you quit mr grohl, go on, please do.
B000001FMX|5.0|What can you say about the band every Brit- Punk and a few american bands used as the template for their sound. Glam, trashy and bluesy. The New York Dolls .(David Johansen,Johnny Thunders, Arthur Kane, Jerry Nolan and Syl Slyvian) were a more real American Rolling Stones  unlike Aerosmith (who suck). Todd Rundgren's peerless production who bought out their strengths, as a band they couldn't play their instruments as well as the Stones But made up for it with passion, great lyrics  and punk attitude from \\"Personality Cirsis\\" to \\"Frankenstein\\" These chuck berry/ classic stones three chord rock songs were back to basics rock-n- roll that would give rise to The Punk movement(great) and mid to the late 80's american hair metal wave. (very, very, bad ugh remember Posion? )But this album is more influential because it to me it is the first true punk album along with \\"Raw Power\\" released in 1973. Get this album and you will throw away your Stink -182,  Good Harlot, and Wimp out Boy  cds in the trash and find out what 5 guys in drag with three chords and a lot of attitude could do.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Yes, there are violence, yes there are a little sex and yes there are blood but it's Sin city !!! Honestly, I liked it, it's a big movie, ironical and funny. <br /> <br />See it !
1881273156|4.0|Our pastor recommended this book for our pre-marital counseling... the book was wonderful the information was just what i was hoping, it taught us how to read each other and to know what we both like/dislike i would recommend this book for someone starting out or been together 20 years either way it will inspire you... Some of the book can be a little borring but the information is well worth it!
B00005JMEW|1.0|You know, The Curmudgeon must be psychic.  I'm a big Tarantino fan; loved Pulp Fiction et al (hell, I even sat through Four Rooms with a smile) but somehow I knew, the ol' Spider Sense was tingling.. this was a stinker.<br /><br />And guess what? I was right. Now, here's what The Curmudgeon wants from a Tarantino movie; excellent performances, layered characters with depth, a crackling, punchy, ultra-quotable script.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being unfair? But everything Tarantino has delivered so far has had just that. And then this nonsense comes out.<br /><br />There is not one likeable character in this entire movie. Uma Thurman looks nice, but CANNOT carry a movie, especially on this unconvincing performance. The script is BORING, a basic revenge movie of no worth and, for all it's fancy gimmicks (ooh, an Anime segment, how post-modern) little class.<br /><br />I know this was raved about when it first came out, but that was just hype. If Kill Bill didn't have Tarantino's name blazened across the top, this movie would sink without trace.<br /><br />Trust me, when the sheep stop bleating about how good this movie is, someone somewhere will go, \\"hey.. you know? It wasn't that good was it?\\" and everyone will agree with THIS review.  Cool huh?<br /><br />The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This album has all the creativity of the previous albums.  This may be their best one yet.  Don't let the copy protection scare you (I didn't).  I was able to disable it in about an hour.  On a Windows machine, just go to a command prompt, and type the following: <br /> <br />net stop sbcphid <br />del %systemroot%\system32\drivers\sbcphid.sys <br /> <br />Enjoy listening to this great album on your iPod or MP3 player.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|I mentioned in another review that I think I may be psychic. I had one of my \\"moments\\" with this, the turgid sequel to the excellent Matrix.<br /><br />I really did enjoy the original movie. It certainly brought something new to the table, even if we did have to endure Keanu Reeves. But it was worth it, raising the bar for action movies and making sure every lame-ass \\"parody\\" movie would have a Matrix-bullet-time sketch.<br /><br />But then I KNEW they were gonna blow it, I KNEW it wasn't going to be good. But hooo boy, I didn't think it would be THIS bad.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, let me tell ya - it is AW-FUL. It's as if the Wachowski brothers went, \\"hmm. You know what? We don't really have much of a story this time. Let's just hide that fact behind a ton of pretentious psycho-babble and hope people think it's intelligent, and if that doesn't work, we'll just throw LOADS and LOADS and LOADS of effects at them. That'll work\\".<br /><br />Not with The Curmudgeon it didn't. This really was one woeful movie. Avoid like a suicide bomber.<br /><br />The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk
1573228737|3.0|Margaret Prior is a lady visitor to the grim Millbank Prison - her role is to encourage the inmates to reflect on their misdeeds. But her encounters with the spiritualist Selina Dawes, convicted of fraud and assault, turn into something more, dot dot dot. This is Sarah Waters so of course we have the two vital elements: lesbianism and Victorianism. She writes beautifully and atmospherically, although I think this suffers from being all in first person - she's not too good at differentiating voices, and it's so limiting in terms of what she tries to achieve in plot and suspense. I enjoyed this mostly until the final sections, partly because the plot becomes rather contrived, and partly because it's so depressing.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|Roger Waters had basically taken over the band at this point.  It was pretty much his band after the release of \\"The Wall\\", and he continued with \\"The Final Cut\\".<br /><br />I always try to think about the person who is genuinely considering whether or not to buy the product.  I write reviews for that person, not for the superfan who might be trolling the reviews looking to pick a fight over some under- or over-appreciated album.<br /><br />If you've heard and enjoyed \\"The Wall\\", then you will probably enjoy this album.  Basically, this album is akin to the more subdued moments in \\"The Wall\\".  It is a concept album about World War 2, with some light touches on the minor wars in between.  (Afghanistan and Lebanon are mentioned, but the album seems blissfully unaware of Vietnam... and that's just as well, since the British went through their war of disillusionment back in 1916 and so Vietnam isn't of much interest to them.)<br /><br />Musically, this album is off the tail-end of Pink Floyd's \\"stadium rock\\" period, to whatever extent that really existed in the first place.  It is slow-paced, subtle but rewarding.  \\"The Wall\\" was half-rooted in Pink Floyd's past, in the proggish rock of \\"Animals\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  That half is completely stripped away in \\"The Final Cut\\", and only the moody reflective elements are left.  Track-by-track, it would fail because no single moment has much impact.  As a whole, it succeeds as greater than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Roger Waters departed the band after this album, and they were never quite the same again (though perhaps the remaining bandmates had the last laugh, since they produced two commercially successful albums, one of which was musically decent, while Waters produced two or three albums full of pretentious experimental crap that would make even Syd Barrett cringe.)  This is a good album, despite its flaws and dissimilarity to previous Pink Floyd releases.  Yet I would recommend that a fan with an incomplete collection hold off on purchasing this one until they had all the quintessential 70's Pink Floyd albums.complete collection hold off on purchasing this one until they had all the quintessential 70's Pink Floyd albums.
B00082IJ08|4.0|I just picked up Demon Days and have been listening for a couple of days.  My impressions of it are that it's not quite as ground breaking as their first album, but still enjoyable.   <br /> <br />Demon Daze has more of a rap/hip hop feel to it with guest rappers on a couple of songs.  I even thought I recognized Ludacriss on \\"All Alone\\" but was incorrect once I looked it up. <br /> <br />Over all, less alternative and experimental than the first album but still enjoyable.  I certainly wouldn't lump it in with radio ready pop music like Brittany Spears and many rap groups lately.
B00004XONN|3.0|This album comes complete with an awful lot of hype.  For the past half-decade, it's been lauded at various hip websites as the pinnacle of the band's career, the pinnacle of contemporary rock music, an experimental masterpiece.<br /><br />Alas, the album itself doesn't live up to the hype.  But don't take that the wrong way.  The album is still amazing in many respects.  The first track is gorgeous and better than anything Radiohead has ever done in other works.  But the rest of the album just doesn't quite come together to amount to anything.  It certainly isn't worth the praise heaped upon it.<br /><br />As always, I try to think of the people who might be led to see this review and consider buying the product.  Some of those people might be fans of Radiohead's earlier albums \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\".  \\"OK Computer\\" was among the five best albums made in the 90's, and certainly it embraced a more expansive view of music than the more conventional \\"The Bends\\".  But \\"Kid A\\" goes too far, it dives head-first into chaos and leaves pleasure and beauty behind.  Do not expect to like \\"Kid A\\" based on having enjoyed any previous Radiohead material.<br /><br />If it sounds like I'm giving \\"Kid A\\" a bad review, that's a mistake.  It's a good album... but not a great album.  The album's experiments miss as often as they hit.  But the great moments on this album are so worth hearing that they outweigh the drab and lifeless moments, if you have the patience.<br /><br />If you can grab it for under $10, I'd pick this up.  Otherwise, pass on it.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|It's a shame that the rating on such a fine album as this has gone down the tubes thanks to today's technology kids. Jesus, people. CDs were made to listen to in CD players. You can find portable CD players in Happy Meals nowdays practically. If you can afford an iPod then there's no reason you can't afford a \\"normal\\" device to play normal music CDs with. You don't need this album on your iPod. If you buy music just to listen to MP3s then don't buy it at all. Some of you people are spoiled to death.    But anyway, about the album. Great stuff. I haven't been so pleased with a double album since The Smashing Pumpkins - Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness (not like there's been alot of rock double albums since then). Like I'm sure you've heard, first disc is heavy, second is acoustic. One thing that's nice about double albums though is that it's always a mixed bag. You'll end up with alot of filler, but there's a song for every type of Foo Fighter fan here.     My personal favorites on the first disc are \\"In Your Honor\\", \\"The Deepest Blues Are Black\\", and \\"End Over End\\". They're all powerful, yet melodic. The finale of \\"End Over End\\" is mindblowing (but hey, FF are masters of big album finales, aren't they?). My favorites on the second disc are \\"Over And Out\\", \\"Virginia Moon\\", and \\"Cold Day In The Sun\\". Norah Jones sings backup vocals on \\"Virginia Moon\\", it's pretty interesting. The second disc takes a few listens before you like it though, upon first listen I fell asleep (beyond the fact that I stayed up until 4:00 AM the night before).    Overall, if you're a Foo Fighters fan of any kind, pick this album up (oh, that is, if you have a CD player). You're more than likely to find a gem or two here.
B00081U6EG|1.0|After being blessed with the likes of ''Concert for George'' and ''Paul McCartney in Red Square'' this is a terrible let down.  Save for The Crickets, Albert Lee and Hank Marvin who offer a descent performance this DVD stinks.  The other performers are totaly unconvincing, they go through the motions and seem totaly bored and boring.  The audience is unresponsive.  If a guitar manufacturers want to advertise their product they should do it with their money not ours, because obviously this is what it is ; a boring 155 minutes commercial from a company who has long ago strayed from the original philosophy of its founder the great Leo Fender.  Don't waste your money.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie packs a punch.  From the opening you are grabbed by the colors and then the action which never lets up.  Mickey Roarke, Bruce Willis, and Clive Owens turns in stunning performances.  I love the old cars, and how you never show exactly how they made the grapics.  Rosario Dawson in black leather looks truly a marvelous creature to feast your eyes on.  The Blonde chicks who plays the silent killer is awesome.  The preformance by Michael Clark Duncan, Jessica Alba, Brittney Murphy, and Bernicio Del Torro are good, but are quickly forgotten.  I've seen this three times and do plan to buy it.   \\"Yes\\"  it is pretty gory, is aimed at adults, \\"Yes\\", it does have hyper violent moments,  and \\"Yes\\" even the good guys with questionable morals become good guys, but none of this detracts from it.
B000002MJR|3.0|I know there is a tendency to vote an unfavorable view of a review when you feel it is disrespecting a band that you love. Look, nobody loves Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler more than me, have every album. However, this is a very questionable CD. Recorded as they toured \\"On Every Street,\\" the playlist is odd. Of course the boys had done other live albums, which had covered great songs not on this album, but still. Many of the songs chosen for this album are soft and not really \\"concert\\" tunes. So many really good songs that have never made it to a live CD are ignored. And then there is the horn playing, too much of it. This album is not the Dire Straits I grew up on. It is too overproduced, there are too many musicians on stage and the playlist is weak. I give it three stars because of my loyalty to the band, but this album seems like nothing more than a quick buck by a record comapny.
0312323859|5.0|It's already been said many times, but like many, I was initially skeptical and unsure about reading this book. I wasn't sure Something Blue could measure up to the excitement of Something Borrowed. But it did. In fact, I like the sequel much better. Everything is tied in nicely.  <br />Though it's been fun getting to know the characters in this 2-part series, I am glad that Emily will be coming out with a new book with completely different characters. I'm sure it will be a page-turner!
0385513755|4.0|I purchased the Special Illustrated Edition thinking that I will be able to enjoy the most comprehensive reading experience. The book arrived as everything I expected: Beautiful hard cover, color pages, and large, comfortable fonts to read. But there is also something I did not expect: It is so heavy, that I was not able to hold it with one hand.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly a good book (hence the 4 star rating), but it weights very uncomfortably on my lap if it stays for a prolonged period of time. So the conclusion is, if you really wanted to read the book, I recommend that you stay with the paperback. For those who would like to have The Encyclopedia of the Da Vinci code, you can consider buying this version to decorate your bookshelf.
B000088E6D|5.0|I looked up this cd to see how the reviews were going.  And having been a fan of Buble since before his debut release, I was happy to see that most of them were perfect 5's.  Then, I saw some \\"kid\\" wrote one of the stupidest reviews I've seen on this site.  So,\\"Kid\\"..... Never actually heard the whole cd?  So what was it about the album that made you an expert reviewer on it, causing you to give it a 1 star rating?  Heard it by other artists and enjoyed it more?  More than what? You haven't even heard the whole cd, remember? Nothing special about doing covers?  How does shaming the original artists strike you for special?  I'll tell you what isnt special about covers: your 50 cent, p. diddy, dr. dre, and boy bands sampling a true artists' songs, ideas, and originality because they couldnt do it.  Not a fan of the music?  Why not?  Is it because there is more to appreciate, such as talent, and real people playing real instruments?  Or is it that there isn't a keyboard playing the drums for you? Maybe it's because he doesn't need a lip syncing track in order to perform on SNL. Yes, MB IS helping a new generation appreciate the old.  I just saw him in concert a few days ago, and there were as many people there my age (early twenties) and younger, as there were older adults, if not more.  Saw it with my own eyes, dude, can't argue with that. Oh, and by the way... my 13 yr old sister DOES put it in her 5 disc changer next to backstreet boys, J-Lo, and Barlow Girl. Go have a talk with HER, she could probably teach you a few things.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A lot of people have said it better than I can. But this show rocks. My brother convinced me to watch and I was hooked from the first episode onwards. Never have I seen a show get so good so fast. I loved the characters, the stories, and the plot.  <br /> <br />I think Fox should stick to reality TV and never ever produce another real tv show again. They can't tell quality from crap and they continue to cancel the best TV shows they have. I think Firefly could have flown a lot futher on another channel.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|I am tired of everyone making fun of Keanu Reeves. Everyone calls him stupid and I can not disagree more. I think Keanu is actually a dark character or at least plays it well in this film. I don't know why there is so much hostility towards this man but I am writing this review to defend him and his acting. I actually think he acted pretty well in this movie, especially in the beginning of the movie where he takes the demon out of a poor girl. Keanu Reeves has good acting skills and actually played out this movie well. This movie's plot is what drew me to this film because it sounded interesting, even though I am not too religious and this movie is heavily drenched in religion. Yet it was played out good nonetheless. I was drawn to see what would happen at the end and it was not predictable. I like the alternative ending as well on the deleted scenes but definitely the first ending is better.  <br />Don't take what a lot of these reviewers said so personally, fellow reader. Keanu Reeves is not as bad as they make him sound. He is actually pretty good in this movie and made this film quite interesting. Honestly if there was a young exorcist I would imagine him to look a lot like Keanu, dark hair and all. The other actors aren't too bad either, I thought the person who played Gabriel was very interesting. I give this movie a solid four stars. Like the movie Stigmata was for me, it was good as a thriller, but too heavily religious for me to be five star. Still good though, and worth watching.
B00005JNSK|4.0|In the remake of Willy Wonka many things have changed. For instance Johnny Depp puts a new spin on the old Wonka feel. In the last Willy Wonka movie, Gene Wilder seems very cheery all the time and just seems to really like his job. He seems to love the children he serves chocolate to. However the new Wonka seems to be embittered and dislikes conversation. He seems not to care for the kids, or maybe he just doesn't understand them. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka. To me, Willy Wonka is supposed to be this weird recluse who people aren't supposed to like very much. Depp definitely got this image correct. Freddie Highmore also did well; he plays a very good Charlie, who isn't quite as nave as he seemed in the past. Then there is David Kelley who played Grandpa Joe.  He too was very good. But of course, credit surely goes to Tim Burton for showing, and bringing together this new side of Willy Wonka. <br /> <br />This movie is not as dark as it is rumored to be. It is a movie that makes you think even if you are a child.  <br /> <br />I never really thought any of this movie was bad. The only slight problem I had with it was the fact that the oompa loompa songs were very difficult to understand and almost too \\"new age\\".  <br /> <br />I really recommend this movie to people of all ages. It is a new take on a classic movie and an enjoyable one at that.
B00005OMTT|1.0|There's a lot most people don't know about the \\"mystical\\" Enigma. Sure, 99.9% of the time, the duo makes bland and uninspired music made to fall asleep to, but I'm sure many of you don't know the story behind their only good song. Gather 'round, 'cause I'm 'bout to tell y'all about the song we all bought this Greatest Hits package for: Return to Innocence. First off, I adore that song. However, I later found out that the \\"Native American\\" chanting that carries the entire song was actually that of Taiwanese Aboriginals whose ritualistic chants were recorded by Cretu without their consent, and used on the song. Cretu never paid the men, and a legal battle ensued. I still love the song, but Cretu needs one swift kick to the ass, and another to the head. The kick in the ass should be for stealing other people's culture and illicitly making a profit, and the other should be to get his brain working so his future songwriting will have an edge his other material lacked. Speaking of which, the rest of the songs on this hits compilation are worthless-yet-serene background noise.

B00005JNEI|5.0|There has been enough said about the politics of F 9/11, but I ask the automatons who inexplicably believe every word out of George W's mouth to verify the facts; see if they add up; and you'll see the hellish bed you've made for yourselves.
B00005JMCT|4.0|American Pie has had the akward teenagers getting laid for the very first time. Now, they are all grown up and they all have their own jobs and are going to other schools. Jim then announces that he is planning to marry Michelle and then the gang comes together for the very last time, with the exception of Stifler. Stifler doesn't know that he isn't invited and goes around having the thought that he is involved in the wedding. Jim cannot have the words to tell him that Stifler actually ends up saving the wedding in spots and becomes a unlikely hero and the book closes on the American Pie saga.<br /><br />When I first heard that there was going to be a third American Pie, I had high expectations. My expectations were met with this hilarous film that closes out the film triliogy. But, I was suprised that the gang was cut in half and alot of the original cast didn't return for the third one. But, they managed to keep the best parts about the films. I thought that it was solid comedy at its best. It is dirtier, filthier, and full of cuss words. It's what made it very good.<br /><br />Sean Willam Scott basically carried the whole film on his shoulders and made the most laughs in the film. His character basically stole every scene that he was in. He made me and everbody laugh uproariously. Stifler was given the whole movie to shine and he took that chance and made one of the most hilarous comedic performances in recent history. He can really carry a film but was never given a chance to, up until now.<br /><br />In closing, American Pie has made us laugh with the famous Jim having intercourse with the pie and having sex for the first time. The third film closes out the series with a bang and makes us rememeber what it was all about all the way to the first film.<br /><br />I had a wonderful time watching these films and I hope you had one magical time with the American Pie saga. I know I did.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  I didn't feel that it took the Holocaust lightly -- in fact, I found that this movie helped me understand the true impact of the holocaust in a way that a documentary or even a heart-wrenching movie like \\"Schindler's List\\" could not.  You are introduced, at length, to a wonderful little family that shares a deep and abiding love.  You become attached to the characters in a way that no other Holocaust movie, in my opinion, achieves.  The transition to the death camp is shocking.  And yet it underlines the amazing power of love -- facing unimaginable horrors, the Benigni character refuses defeat, and puts all of his soul and effort into saving his son, not only from death, but from the scarring knowledge of the hell that is all around him.  The father's love for his wife and son are truly inspiring.   <br /> <br />It may be true that this is unrealistic... how does anyone know how they would act in such a situation?  But it is uplifting to believe that it is possible to defeat evil with love, even if one loses one's life in the process.
6305313687|5.0|Wow! What a movie! I was nervous about this movie, because I thought it might be too much for me. Well, I finally saw it. It was very disturbing and moving and is a masterpiece. The movie is excellent with powerful performances notably by Edward Norton. Where's his oscar? Why'd Roberto Benigni get it? Edward was robbed! <br />The movie is very powerful and moving and has a very sad and tragic ending. The movie is so sad because it is depicting reality. The watcher sees these skinheads and how awful they are. But, then you think about some of Edward Norton's statements and how they're maybe true. This makes you think a lot. The movie is about the leader of the skinheads, Derek (Edward Norton) who is sent to jail for killing some black guys trying to steal his car. His brother Donny (Edward Furlong) is headed down the same path as Derek but once Derek is released, he is a changed man. He feels bad for what he has done and wants to change. But his brother is confused and the skinheads aern't happy with their ex leader. The movie is so powerful and moving and shows the remarquable transformation of a mean and angry man into a kind and caring man.  <br />This movie is one of my favorites ever and I recommend it to everyone. It's not for light hearted people but this needs to be seen. This is an amazing movie that EVERYONE should see. You'll cry, turn your head away in disgust and might even get 1 or 2 laughs.
B0006L16N8|1.0|The colossal breakdown of rock music directly related to the pathetic lack of intelligence of the listeners of today's cultural music phenomenon is apparent with the success of bands like Coldplay and the Dave Matthews Band. The music is 5th grade level. There is no fundamental reason for this trash to sell millions of records besides the fact that millions own either ear-busting home and car stereo systems that they NEVER shut off, or those dreadful MP3 players where sound is noise- the buyer never hears the music as it was created- an essentially then is acceptable dentist-office background trash. <br /> This band has no talent except for being blah. No adventurous musical meanderings, no efficient storytelling- it's simple noise, and there's 1,000 other bands out there in line to fill their spot. <br /> I heard this album while with my 40-year old sister. I kept gazing at her expression- one of blank strangeness as if she was in a trance. In my mind I think she was lulled- and not just by the music of Coldplay- but her mass of other CD's of same-type music- into a catatonic state of mind. <br /> Quite simply, music has died, and bands like Coldplay, while I do not doubt their sincere efforts, are just keeping the nightmare of the 80's and 90's alive- the untimely death of Rock music as I have known it in my lifetime. So I stick to my music of the past that had integrity- whether the Allman Brothers or Chicago or even Led Zeppelin- and sift through todays bands with SOME intellect- like Dream Theater and U2. I don't even turn on the radio to \\"oldies\\" anymore, because you hear the same trash because \\"oldies\\" now includes the 90's and garbage like Nirvana. Long gone are the days when music mattered. <br /> So I will continue to be lulled into catatonic sleep by my neighbor's constant play of Coldplay and other creators of \\"Music of the next generation.\\" Keep it. Bust a gut. Some of us will never conform...(see \\"The Wall\\" by Pink Floyd.)
B00008H2LB|4.0|Now, before I write a review on this, I have to clear a few things up for people who aren't very open-minded at all. <br />Linkin Park is a blend of rock AND rap... no, it's not true rock, but I like it, so if you don't like hearing the mix of the two, then DON'T get this CD. It's that simple. Now, the stereotype that only wannabe goths listen to this music is ridiculous, I'm as preppy as they come. Their lyrics are very original, and relate to many things in real life. Now, these are my views...you don't have to believe them, but Linkin Park almost has its own genre of music, which some people happen to like. I may hate country and ska music, but people have a right to listen to them and they aren't \\"ruining\\" any other genres of music. So enough about this and more about the actual album, Meteora. <br /> <br />Meteora is Linkin Park's third album, if you count Reanimation, (which I do--an album is an album)and it is overall a very good compilation of songs, but in no way does it even come close to Hybrid Theory's success. There are some good songs on this album, and some of them sound like they were derived from songs on Hybrid Theory. (By the way... just because masses of people like a song, and if the song is considered 'mainstream' doesn't mean you have to immediately discard it as trash... I really don't understand that concept. If you like it, listen to it. If you don't, then don't listen to it!!!) <br /> <br />Let's go over the tracks on Meteora. <br /> <br />1)Foreword [3/10]: I gotta agree with most of you, there is no reason for this to be a seperate track. It's basically the beginning of the next track, 'Don't Stay'. It kind of kills the opening of the CD, to be honest. <br /> <br />2)Don't Stay [6.5/10]: This is a pretty good track, not really one of my favorites, but it's a decent song and Chester's vocals are loud and booming over the instrumentals. <br /> <br />3)Somewhere I Belong [8.5/10]: Some might say this was built to be just like 'In The End',but regardless, this in my opinion was one of the better tracks on Meteora. Shinoda's rhymes carry this song along with Bennington's very catchy chorus. <br /> <br />4)Lying From You [9/10]: This is a pretty heavy song, where the mix of Chester's angry-sounding vocals, heavy bass, and Mike's amazing rapping on this track makes it my favorite track on Meteora. I'm sure many don't agree on this, but it's my personal favorite. <br /> <br />5)Hit the Floor [6/10]: The instrumentals in this song really aren't that great, the vocals are good, but the background of this song just bores me, making it a sub-par track. <br /> <br />6)Easier to Run [6.5/10]: Okay, so maybe it sounds like Crawling. That's not factoring into my decision for this song. It has a much slower tempo than most of the songs on this album. Bennington's vocals are decent, but he kills Shinoda's rapping as he kind of raps and sings at the same time as Shinoda raps. If the tempo were sped up, and Chester would just stick to his own vocals, this would be a decent song. <br /> <br />7)Faint [7.5/10]: This is a good song because of the quickness and the beat. The instrumentals in the background hurry the song and make Chester's screaming fit in harminously with Shinoda's rap. <br /> <br />8)Figure.09 [8/10]: This is an extremely good track. Shinoda starts off rapping, and then it blends perfectly into Chester's vocals in the chorus. My favorite line here is \\"I took what I hated and made it a part of me.\\" <br /> <br />9)Breaking the Habit [7.5/10]: This is a catchy track that doesn't include Shinoda in it, and if I had to pick one track to not include him in, this would be it. Bennington has catchy lyrics with a great instrumental in the background. <br /> <br />10) From the Inside [5/10]: I really don't like this song very much. Chester just sounds like he's whining during most of Shinoda's rap, and during the vocals. The chorus is alright, but it doesn't make up for the rest of the song. <br /> <br />11) Nobody's Listening [7.5/10]: This track is a majority of Shinoda's rap. The Japanese flutes in the background really add that bit of spice to the track, and Bennington's lyrics in the chorus really make this a great song. <br /> <br />12) Session [7/10]: I don't know why everyone's saying this isn't music. It is, and it's a great instrumental--in my opinion, better than 'Cure for the Itch'. This is the kind of song they could play at sports games and stuff, it really pumps you up. <br /> <br />13) Numb [8/10] I definitely would agree that this is the best track to close out 'Meteora' with, Bennington dominates this track, but Shinoda makes the hook great with his lyrics \\"Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow\\" and the song ends on a great note, ending the CD on a great note as well. <br /> <br />So, to conclude, this CD was very good, but not as good as Hybrid Theory. As much as I love Linkin Park, I don't think they'll ever be able to make a CD as good as their first. <br /> <br />[AD] <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I've been a fan since '89 when nobody knew they existed and it pains me to say that TOT is just short of an absolute flop. I wanted to like it and listened several times hoping it would get better but it never happened. This album has no life, no soul, no nothing, never goes anywhere. Unbelievably Petrucci's solos are also boring. Shredding for the sake of shredding. The first 4 tracks drag on and on and on for a minimum of 10 minutes each, totally formulaic and going through the motions.  <br />Falling Into and Six Degrees were mediocre overall but had flashes of brilliance which warranted extended listening. Not the case here as TOT will gather dust in my CD rack.
0385338686|5.0|I have liked almost all of author Sophie Kinsella's books, and THE UNDOMESTIC GODDESS is no exception. <br /> <br />Kinsella spins a good yarn, and the reason that her plots work this well is that she, herself, so thoroughly understands the settings into which she places her heroines. <br /> <br />There is a theme to Kinsella's novels, a theme which ultimately distills to an upper class young woman with everything going for her who unwittingly screws up her own life; the remainder of these works turn on the heroines' redemptions. <br /> <br />Still, it is the sharp observer's eye that Kinsella possesses, her clever imagination, and her keen (very keen) sense of humor that sets her fiction above the ordinary. This unusual and superior combination of elements have turned her novels into great--and deserved--successes. THE UNDOMESTIC GODDESS is no exception to the author's personal formula for excellence.
B00005NB8K|4.0|One of my favorite stories about Oliver Stone's \\"The Doors\\" comes secondhand, from a guy I know who saw the movie with a female acquaintaince.  About halfway through, she asked him, \\"What year did Jim Morrison die?\\", to which he replied, \\"1971.\\"   \\"And what year is it now?\\" \\"1968.\\"  She then sighed, a long and bored sigh. <br /> <br />\\"The Doors\\" is not easy viewing.  It is also not a strict biography of the band The Doors, because if it were, Frank Whaley and Kevin Dillon actually would have had something to do in the movie, rather than become perhaps the highest-paid extras in Hollywood history. <br /> <br />Once you understand these two joint concepts -- that Oliver Stone is making a movie about an idea rather than about a specific chain of actual events -- \\"The Doors\\" becomes essential viewing, not just the story of another band, but rather about a band that tried to break on through and redefine a generation's consciousness.  Until the lead singer burned himself out. <br /> <br />Jim Morrison quite clearly burrowed deeper into his own mind than most of us would care to go.  This trip, pardon the pun, unearthed song lyrics that were alternately of breathtaking clarity (\\"The Unknown Soldier\\") or revoltingly disjointed (\\"Not to Touch the Earth\\")... and that was on the same album.  By that same token, some scenes in \\"The Doors\\" are wonderful: the moment when Morrison composes the second verse of \\"Light My Fire\\" as an improv.  Other scenes go on forever and do nothing but make you loathe the man: the live performance of \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\"; any scene in which he asks a woman to \\"die for\\" him. <br /> <br />Where the DVD is occasionally hurt by the loss of subtitles (the dialogue in many scenes is unintelligible), Stone's director commentary is surprisingly spare and informative.  There's not much rambling here.  He explains which scenes were real, which were imagined (albeit based on real moments), which characters are composites. <br /> <br />I had no idea, before watching the DVD, that one of Stone's associates actually appears as Death, perhaps a dozen times, at first shortly after a direct quote from \\"The Seventh Seal\\", and then engaged in a progressive interplay with Morrison that climaxes at a birthday party late in the film.  Stone's commentary on Death's role in the movie plays a bit like a routine from \\"The Simpsons\\": \\"That's death!\\" \\"No, Grampa, that's Patricia Kennealy.\\" \\"That's death!\\" \\"No, Grampa, that's Nico.\\" \\"That's DEATH!\\" \\"No, Grampa, that's Patricia Kennealy again.\\" <br /> <br />Similarly, I knew that Floyd Red Crow Westerman played an Indian shaman supposedly transferred into Morrison's soul; I did not know that one scene in the movie shows him departing, clearly fed up with the increasing chaos. <br /> <br />This movie may never have worked without Val Kilmer.  It is impossible to tell where he ends and Morrison begins.  Kilmer seems to recognize that this movie is not a linear bio; even in scenes firmly rooted in historical fact (the meeting with Ray Manzarek on Venice Beach in 1965), Kilmer plays Morrison as stoned immaculate.  The sequence of Morrison's final poetry reading, split up as prologue and interludes throughout the movie, show Kilmer effortlessly playing the wise, drunken poet with prescient dialogue (\\"Enough to base a movie on?\\"). <br /> <br />The DVD advertises 43 minutes of \\"deleted scenes\\", though much of that is actually extended scenes, incorporating material already in the movie.  Kilmer's take on \\"Gloria\\" and particularly \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" would have added much to the texture of the movie had they not been deleted. <br /> <br />\\"The Doors\\" is now 15 years old, but still looks as if it were produced yesterday.  Kilmer's performance achieved the one thing that Morrison could not: immortality.
B00005JNZ4|4.0|Diane Lane is wonderful as Sarah Nolan, the preschool teacher whose family is convinced needs their help in escaping from the emotional wasteland which they see as the result of her recent divorce. In an effort to help Sarah find an interesting date which might blossom into real romance, her sisters Carol (Elizabeth Perkins) and Christine (Ali Hillis) conspire to post her somewhat embellished description which ends with the tag line \\"MUST LOVE DOGS\\" on an internet dating site. And while Sarah is at first mortified, she becomes intrigued enough to eventually search through the replies and arrange a blind date which initially reinforces her belief in the folly of the endeavor. However, she subsequently decides to make one more attempt, and meets Jake Anderson at the dog park. Jake is there because his friend has convinced him that he needs to stop wallowing in self-pity while repeatedly watching Dr. Zhivago in the belief that it will eventually end happily if he simply waits long enough. The moviegoer immediately senses the symmetry of their emotions, since Jake is also still recovering from his recent divorce and spends his time fashioning wonderful handcrafted wooden racing sculls whose details of master craftmanship are unappreciated by buyers who now want the convenience and speed of the new generation of fiberglass hulls. Of course, as in all romantic comedies, their initial conversation hits several speed bumps and Jake and Sarah and their borrowed (but beloved) dogs each head their separate ways. <br /> <br />They do subsequently decide that there was enough attraction to get together for dinner, and a truly hilarious although overblown scene regarding their lack of a condom ensues. (Yes, this movie has some adult moments despite the PG-13 rating and generally bland humor.) Their lives subsequently drift along, with Sarah being gently hit upon Bob Connor (Dermot Mulroney), the recently separated Dad of a very precocious student in her nursery school. After thatrelationship ends in disappointment (surprise, surprise, since you know Lane and Cusack share the biliing as the two co-stars), a furher obstacle gets in the way when Sarah encounters Jake on a date with a very good looking young woman who a friend has repeatedly implored him to meet. There is also an interrelated plot involving the internet dating habits of Sarah's recently widowed father Bill (Christopher Plummer) and several interested widows including Dolly (Stockard Channing). Of course, after several twists and turns and lots of funny moments, Sarah and Jake eventually reunite in a scene appropriately shared by their third co-star, the Newfoundland wonderfully named Mother Teresa. (No your eyes aren't deceiving you, if you stay for the outtakes which accompany the credits you will see that two slightly different looking dogs shared the work involved in stealing many of the scenes in which Mother Teresa was on camera.) <br /> <br />This movie is exactly what it is advertised to be. It is a lighthearted adult romantic comedy to simply be enjoyed in the knowledge that there will be many truly funny moments and that you will feel good when you leave the theater. (The audience when we attended laughed out loud frequently, not just smiled and chuckled.)  It doesn't have the star power of NOTTING HILL or the chemistry of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in PRETTY WOMAN, but the performances of the leads are very good and the moviegoer soon thinks of them as Sarah and Jake, not Diane Lane and John Cusack. It also has the most memorable dogs in a romantic comedy since Bear and Bryant in the also critically panned but extremely enjoyable SWEET HOME ALABAMA. So, while strictly speaking there is no requirement that you MUST LOVE DOGS to enjoy this film, if you do you will certainly get an extra measure of enjoyment from it.  <br /> <br />Tucker Andersen <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Many claimers exist out in our world who are denouncing Michael Moore as idiocy and the father of inaccuracy, but those very comments are clearly hogwash and an attempt to character assassinate Michael Moore. Why they would \\"attempt\\" to do that to a man who is actually revolutionizing our world with his film, instead of a man, that is Bush, who has almost destroyed our country? Obviously, they have nothing better to do than spout off \\"their\\" inaccurate claims that he is incorrect. All one needs to do is visit MichaelMoore.com to \\"verify\\" the supposed \\"inaccurate\\" facts with news stories and data to backup his claims. <br /> <br />Another \\"true\\" erroneous assertion that Bush supporters \\"continue\\" to make is that \\"our\\" media is liberal. HA! Have they not seen the partisan documentary \\"Free Speech for Sale,\\" or \\"The Myth of the Liberal Media\\"? The media in America is far from liberal. The gatekeepers, are almost always white, conservative, and Republicans. Don't believe me, stop being brainwashed by the \\"conservative\\" media and (again) watch, \\"The Myth of The Liberal Media.\\" Ben Bagdikian's book, \\"The Media Monopoly\\" is an excellent book talking about how media power \\"is\\" political power. Hence, the conservative power of the media as gatekeepers to skew, censor or shape news discourse.  <br /> <br />Regrettably, Republican ideology generally avoids change that occurs in society and instead pushes for things to \\"stay the same,\\" or for them to \\"go back to the way it used to be.\\" But if people \\"go back\\" to the way things used to be, they will again unleash many of society's ills that we continue to desperately fight against. Moreover, I cannot comprehend why anyone would want to re-elect our current Republican president once more. But unfortunately, these buffoons did! <br /> <br />Among many other things, earlier last year, Bush advocated writing discrimination into the Constitution, he has been handed nearly everything to him in life because of his last name, he cannotsufficiently articulate on par with most other politicians, he continues to push through legislation and tax cuts that benefit the very rich, and he has aligned himself with extreme right-wing organizations and people. <br /> <br />As a matter of fact, one of the nation's most powerful driving force is deeply embedded into the Republican Party: The Religious Right. Unfortunately, religion has been used for hundreds of years to oppress based on gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and religion.  <br /> <br />Today, of course, we do not experience the extreme religious fanaticism that occurred centuries ago. Nevertheless, with the Religious Right backed by millions of dollars and millions of faithful followers, they easily continue lobbying their agenda to Washington. As it is now, it is also a very threatening situation when seven of the highest-ranking Republican senators receive a 100 percent scorecard from the right-wing organization, the Christian Coalition. <br /> <br />In his book, \\"The Most Dangerous Man in America?: Pat Robertson and the Rise of the Christian Coalition,\\" Robert Boston sheds much light on Robertson's theocratic rhetoric, which threatens the separation of church and state on many interrelated issues. Most absurdly, during an address to the American Center for Law and Justice in 1993, Robertson commented, \\"There is no such thing as separation of church and state in the Constitution. It is a lie of the Left and we are not going to take it anymore.\\"  <br /> <br />The author also makes known many of Robertson's sordid actions and claims, which include his ability to communicate with God directly, and the insensitive comments he made shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks that were also very similar to Jerry Falwell's. Unfortunately, President Bush has certainly done his part to please the Religious Right. For instance, many will never forget when he appointed extreme right-wing John Ashcroft as our country's attorney general.  <br /> <br />Regarding Ashcroft, in my letter-to-the-editor published in the San Antonio Current on Jan. 25, 2001, I said, \\"During his time in the Senate, John Ashcroft sponsored unconstitutional legislation violating the Bill of Rights. He is against the Fourth Amendment. He refused to protect abortion clinics from right-wing organizations. He praised Confederate soldiers for fighting to uphold slavery. He blocked the nomination of a gay man for an ambassadorship. He fought federal judgeship of an African American, and blocked efforts to bring an end to racial profiling.\\" <br /> <br />In the end, I just want a president who will fight for all civil rights (ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and others), be liberal-progressive, have common sense and not cave in to corporate interests. It did not happen last year, and this hopeful reality may be far off in the distance. But like most people who share my sentiment, I will stay optimistic but also realistic, and hope undecided people and people who have been complacent and apathetic to voting in the past, will eventually start to use their power to initiate some change because we definitely need it.  <br /> <br />And Michael, Michael Moore: God Bless You for making this film. Although Bush is president again, I know God will help us...and these brainwashed people who voted for him...I pray that they will see the light as many of us have already seen it, for years. God keep our country safe from terrorists, ultra-conservative Republicans destroying our country and from complacency and apathy! I have faith! Tengo la esperanza in mi pais! <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|A more far reaching album than previous musical ventures from the Emerald Isle, the singers here explore a wider range of genres and styles while essentailly retaining a sound that is beautiful, haunting and unmistakably Irish in origin.<br /><br />It has echoes of Clannadh, Enya and Riverdance but with a nod to the orchestral and classical. A lovley album that will delight and bring, at once, a sense of the familair and a refreshing breath of air to this tried, tested and thoroughly delicious regional music.
0739313126|5.0|This was an excellent book.  Much better than \\"The Rule of Four\\".  Do not worry about what other reviewers have written about this book not being accurate.  It is a fictional (stress on fiction) work.<br /><br />Reading this book is like going to the theatre.  In theatre, you have to allow yourself to believe what you know to be fake.  Do the same thing with this book.  While reading it, allow yourself to believe but don't put too much stock in this book being true.<br /><br />It is a great testament to the author that his fictional work can make the reader actually wonder for a moment if the book could actually be factual as opposed to fanciful.<br /><br />Read it, but remember...fiction.
B00000AOUD|4.0|\\"Thick as a Brick,\\" recorded in the early '70s is Tull's best album, even better than \\"Aqualung.\\" I consider it the British group's masterpiece. From Ian Anderson's flute work to the poetic lyrics, one would have to be pretty thick not to appreciate this work. The CD also comes with a live performance track and another track featuring comments from the group about how they wrote and recorded \\"Thick\\" in just a few weeks. The \\"newspaper\\" that accompanies the CD is also a treat for those with strong eyes. (The print is so small that one needs a magnifying glass.) Besides that, the only bad thing is that not all of the \\"newspaper\\" is included. It appears that the bottom of each page is cut off to accomodate the smaller packaging. <br />Dave from Paxton, IL
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I borrowed this movie out of impulse when it came to DVD in Australia. I should of seen it earlier is all I could say after watching it.  <br /> <br />This movie has you rooting for the person that everyone has once in their life shunned or looked down on.  <br /> <br />The movie Revolves aruound Napoleon Dynamite, a geeky misfit in his small Idaho town. Accomplied By friends Deb and Pedro Napolen sets out to prove he has nothing to prove. His family is just outragous from a cute sleazy uncle to a bullying pounce of a brouther.  <br /> <br />It really has no straight forward storyline. This suits the movie better anyway. It really focusses on the life of this kid showing the person he is genuinley.     <br /> <br />The characters are just the funniest. I loved Uncle Rico the best with his sleazy and shotty merchandise.  <br /> <br />It rerally is fantastic that the whole town is interesting and it is a part of the States that is not featured much.  <br /> <br />A great script, broad characteristics and fantastic actors make this the best Movie of 2004. If your not Clapping to a ceratin dance scene you need to wake up and watch it again.  <br />
B00000ILGX|5.0|You need to be British and to have lived through the 80s in the UK to really appreciate Wham's Best Of. Hearing the music will take you back to the carefree days of the 80s and the clever videos that accompanied the music. Remember Club Tropicana with Ridgeley and Michael frollicking by the pool, to emerge at the end as airline pilots?<br />The digital remixing gives a depth and clarity that was lost in the 80s compact cassettes and vinyl records.<br />A great compilation and you really can't expect it to contain George Michael's Careless Whisper, no matter how good it is! Would you expect Yellow Submarine on a Best of Wings compilation? I think not.
B000002UZ1|5.0|I'm sorry people, but I am only 18 years old the only historic Beatles momments I have been alive for are the deaths of John and George, but even though I am young this is a great album! If you like the earlier stuff so be it, but you have to take this time period as a classic there are some really good songs on here.
0393035158|4.0|Sam Harris isn't the first author/academic to implore us to use reason rather than religion, but he certainly has the ability to provoke new thoughts from the sleeping mind.  All organized religions are given the same critical consideration in this book.  While his accounts of the literal Islamic lifestyle are troubling, the documentation of literal Christianity within our own country is just as scary.  Harris lays out the contradictions of literal religious interpretation so well that no reasonable person could walk away from it the same.   <br /> <br />His argument that religious moderation can be just as dangerous as religous extremism is introduced and explored thoroughly.  Although I'm not sure that I agree with his theory entirely, it does have some strong points to consider.  No doubt, this is part of why so many religious conservatives invite him onto TV and radio programs for a shouting match.  But Sam Harris doesn't bite.  His ability to remain calm and respond with perfect reason in these situations is astounding.  That is the small hopeful light I saw at the end of this book.  Common sense and a rational mind will always trump fairy tales.
0143034901|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read and I am one of those people who reads every book they can get their hands on. I suggest this book to anyone who will take the time to read it. It is is so great because the book is about a book. Carlos Ruiz Zafon captivates you with his words and he makes so you never want to put the book down. Again this is one of the best books ever. I hope you like it.
B00030590I|5.0|Let me tell you why some Americans hate this film. You see, this is a Chinese film. That's right, a film made in that not-a-democracy China. What's worse, it's a communist country, and an Asian one at that! Now most Americans can't read Chinese, can't speak Chinese, know diddly squat about China, and haven't been to China (or anywhere outside of their counties, for that matter). But they will knock anything Chinese! They simply hate China for reasons they don't even understand.    I have lived in the US for 14 years, and I can tell you this: more than 80% of Americans are an uninformed, propaganda-driven herd.    Regardless of the origin of the film, I submit that sacrifice for the greater good is a noble cause in any culture. Yet you see many Americans (and Brits, Aussies) doggedly obsess over the fact that the film is made in a communist country and the message is a communist one. Load of crap. It's only an excuse. Deep down, they hate the film because of their blind hatred for China and disdain for all things Asian. Take, for example, Braveheart, a historically based fiction well-received in the US which extols the heroism of William Wallace. Supposedly Willie fights and dies for Freedom. But does he die for his freedom to go shop at WalMart anytime he desires? No. Willie is a \\"hero\\" because his cause is (supposedly) freedom for Scotland. (Of course, his fight doesn't really start until his woman is slain, and he gets into big big trouble with the Brits.)  In any case, the theme is sacrifice for the greater good. Americans foam in the mouth praising this film. But if sacrifice for the greater good is communist ideology, isn't it evil?    Hero is not completely historically accurate, but which Hollywood flick is?  Hero is simply a story well told, and told with astounding visual beauty.  It's great entertainment, and in that respect it's nearly perfect.    PS.  For those of you who can't speak Chinese, the English translation in this movie is reasonably good, although some emotion and power of the Chinese language is lost in the process.    Certain things simply sound lame when expressed in English (this goes both ways, of course).  However, there is a major mis-translation.  The two words written by Broken Sword actually means \\"all under heaven,\\" not \\"our land.\\"  Not even close.  But then, it's simply impossible to translate some things faithfully from Chinese into English, without making it sound tacky.
0060575816|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I picked this one up. I'd heard of Garth Nix, but to be honest the striking cover caught my eye. (The Australian edition is solid black with a magic sigil dead center.)  Oh, and the local Dymocks store had plastered a 'Critic's Choice' award on the cover, and I'm sure there was an Aurealis Award in there too.<br /><br />Anyway, I departed the store with book in hand. And I was captivated - I remember reading the first couple of chapters in my car, while my daughter did soccer training, and for all I know she kicked four goals and won the game off her own boot, because I was lost to the world.<br /><br />Highly imaginative, dark, entertaining...  forget the 'young adult' category this book is often shelved in, and just enjoy it as a wonderful story.
B000AARKOO|5.0|When it comes to castles, horses, extras in the thousands, and all-star casts, Ridley Scott handles it with amazing cinematic dexterity and visual grace.  From the opening scene, you know you are in good hands.  Amazing blue hues, the peaceful presence of snowflakes, and authentic costumes throw you into the world of the story.  Crusading barons, blacksmiths, and arrogant priests throw you into the ultimate conflict of the story. <br /> <br />Orlando Bloom plays Balian, with much improved acting skill due largely in part to Ridley Scott's directing, and the ultra-realistic cinematography.  He joins a heavyweight cast of Liam Neeson, Edward Norton, and David Thewlis.  Any scene that he finds himself in with these three guys, are probably the best of the movie.  In any event, the sooner you suspend your disbelief that the skinny Orlando can take on vicious foreign fighters and master swordsmen, the easier it will be to enjoy the movie.  These events happen quite frequently.  The guy looks like if you shoved him, he would stumble backwards and fall over from the weight of his armor.   <br /> <br />What drives this movie, is the incredible adventure that Balian embarks on.  It is more of an adventure than it is an action movie (which it is far from).  After reuniting with his lost father, he engages in battle, travels miles on horseback, crosses the sea on a rickety ship, and makes his way to Jerusalem.  This movie is rather the combination of \\"Seven Years in Tibet\\" and \\"Gladiator\\".   <br /> <br />It seems that the Muslims feel they are portrayed badly in this film, while the Christians feel they are the ones who are portrayed as vicious killers and full of sin.  This just shows that even in entertainment, we can't put our beliefs aside, and at least TRY to get a message from the movie.  Of the 6 fight scenes that occur in this film, 4 of them deal directly with the Muslim against Christian ideals.  But when these fights occur, they are all too surreal, visually breathtaking, and far more corrupt than any battles that i have seen in a film before.  When the christians raid a peaceful (although, slightly guilty) muslim caravan, blood is cast through the air, and splatters against our christian friends.  When an outnumbered band of Ibelin knights rush the oncoming Muslim tide of cavalry, the screams, the blood, the dirt, and the death portrayed is vicious and beautiful.  And while visually impressive, the siege of Jerusalem may not sit well with some people.  Lets just put it this way; hot oil and fire are not friends of attackers. <br /> <br />In the end, Kingdom of Heaven will draw you back to the glorious days of the epic when story was more important than battles. <br /> <br />P.S - Be on the lookout for the extended edition of Kingdom of Heaven.  Around the holiday season, Ridley intends to release the movie with more than an hour of extended footage.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|With as much richness as this film holds, it is difficult to pick a point as to where to begin. I will preface this review with a bit of an understanding. This is a film that strongly divides people in terms of their temperament towards the film. I loved it. My appreciation of the style in which Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow was modeled after comes from a very long history. Also my love for technology and the various applications never cease to amaze me. With that having been said, let me go into some of the film's details. <br /> <br />Most remarkably, the retro futuristic feel of this film reminds the viewer of a visualization of radio sci-fi dramas of the 30s and 40s or perhaps a live action version of a graphic novel of the same era. The stereotypical characters are in full swing: the unassuming brainy assistant to the hero, the hero heartthrob and the headstrong and brassy yet vulnerable female reporter. The only slight deviation is the tough female protagonist and mysterious female villian. The colors in this film are so saturated and magnificent that you describe it to others as technicolor. <br /> <br />Acting in this film is quite impressive considering the amount of CG special effects that they had to anticipate and react with. Oscar winning performances perhaps not but spot on for the film genre. The actors chosen to play parts in the film were well chosen for their classic look that enhanced the ability to embody the characters.  <br /> <br />Make-up and wardrobe was also well done to coincide with the era and film continuity. Stylistic elements to transition from scene to scene are pretty amazing to. For example when flying from futuistic city to the mountains of Nepal, the plane flies over an illustrated map. Classic and stylish. There are also montages to advance the story that seem right out of the serials of the golden age. The dialogue also follows the formula with a few chuckles along the way. <br /> <br />I enjoy this film for its sci fiescapism. Many were skeptical of the production process used as it may signal a decline in things to come but I couldn't see that all films would be produced like this in the future. We may get snapshots every once and a while that take us on a retro futuristic journey but this film can stand side by side with a film that has live scenery.
B00001PE4D|1.0|It is one of the most weird and saddest movies Ive ever seen. I cannot forgive those who made it that they did not state clearly who is evil and who innocent among characters. It can easily  serve as model for empty headed youngsters how to become mooks and (...)be proud of it at the same time. I must praise Reese Witherspoon for genuine acting but I still shudder with the very thought of it. Hope I wont know anybody like them.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I came across this movie on the PBS channel was unable to turn the channel from the first moments.  It is a touching and deep movie whose impact will stay with me for a long time to come. I am a big fan of people breaking the borders and this is the epitome of that struggle.
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used can be labeled emo, punk, lite screamo, but it's really none of these in it's entirety; it should be labeled \\"ORIGINAL.\\" I actually enjoy this CD over the newer, seemingly more popular \\"In Love and Death\\". I think the in their first CD, they get know what direction they want to go in during the entire CD.  <br /> <br />The best songs on this album are \\"The Tast of Ink\\", \\"Bury Me Alive\\", and \\"Blue and Yellow\\". It's actually hard to pikc just three songs, but i decided to limit it down to these. While the opening track is nothing special (it should be; first tracks should always recieve the most attention), it blasts you AWAY with the incredible well-harmonized \\"Tast of Ink.\\" My second favorite song would be \\"Blue and Yellow\\", probably because this is such a simplistic song and it's so beautifully down, the choruses getting more and more thrashing and the song is just a beautiful masterpiece that is hard to find in today's dumbed-down music. <br /> <br />Also, don't take The Used as being the same as My Chemical Romance. MRC WANTS to be The Used, but they can definatley not pull it off as well as the originals do it :) <br /> <br />Check out this CD...even if you don't like emo or punk. It's really just a great CD in it's own way and form, and cannot really be placed in some labeled box that the music industry today want's everyone to be in these days.  <br /> <br />Finally, buy this CD before you buy \\"In Love and Death.\\" Their second CD feels more like an aquired taste and newcomers to The Used will not enjoy it as much as they will this CD. <br /> <br />Have fun and enjoy some great music!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|When I first heard that Metheny and the gang were coming up with an album with just one continuous track, I was certainly not expecting it to be this good. Unlike other Metheny stuff, this one took a little time to grow on me but now I am just addicted to it. The composition is brilliant with a lot of changes of feel and tempo going into all kinds of different time signatures and complex arrangements. To me it just seems like a miracle that these guys can remember all their different parts so well and execute them so amazingly on stage (yes, I did see them live in Paris and was totally mesmerized!!). The newcomers play amazingly as well and I have already become a fan of Cuong Vu and Antonio Sanchez and cannot wait to hear more stuff from these guys. On the whole, Metheny and Mays never cease to amaze me by their creativity and originality.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|wow-just wow. I though these guys lost their way but Octavarium is an astounding album. DT fuse absurde levels of technical ability on their instruments with great melodies. The last band that achieved this wasFaith No More (RIP). <br />Just great songs and absurd key and guitar solos. And for the first time DM's singer's voice does not screech (sreiously) <br />Highly recommended-hard rock release of the year??
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This DVD presentation didnt disappoint in any way! It offers the theatrical release and the additional extended footage. This is Disney Studios at their best! This story touched many hearts worldwide and promises to do so for years to come! <br /> <br />This is what the Studio did best, a classic fairy tale, well planned animation, top notch musical numbers and characters that actually mean something. I guess they lost their touch after Mulan.  I liked Atlantis, but it was a far cry from Beauty and the Beast. <br /> <br />I remember in the 1980s when it looked as if it were curtains for my childhood illustrator. Then came The Little Mermaid.  Totally revived. Then this new slump...
B000002JOH|5.0|Kid, go home. Listen to the album again. How can you say that Dimebag can't play guitar? You desperately need help. And, to conclude: if you don't like it, leave it at that. You don't have to call them \\"c--k knocking motherf--kers.\\" Take your pre-pubescent ass to a damn toy store. <br /> <br />Now I have just recently in the past six years gotten into Pantera, but this album definitely stands the test of time as do their other releases. The musicianship is something you just can't find nowadays in metal bands, with the exception of Opeth and a very select few. It's too bad Dimebag passed away. Hopefully experienced musicianship didn't go with him.
B000003TAR|5.0|Although the super-catchy, hook-driven, bob-your-head, heavy pop of Nevermind was what attracted the over 25 crowd to this band and the \\"hey that's how I'm feeling\\" teen angst mentality was what attracted those under, In Utero wasn't really made for any one specific group and was embraced by all.  <br />Nirvana's third studio album will always play second fiddle to the phenomenon that will always be Nevermind and the music and lyrics of this album far outweigh Nevermind's as far as growth and maturity go, (which is funny considering about half this album's songs were written at about the same time as most of the songs on Nevermind) the album goes from harsh, heavy, abbrasive, slap-your-face hard rock, to quiet, somber, melodic ballads of love, hate and loneliness.  <br />More striking than anything else on this album is the vocal passion that leaks through the speakers with every song, much more so, in my opinion, than on Nevermind.  <br />By now all the songs on In Utero are well known and immediatly recognizable and while the album will never be held as highly as Nevermind, it was and is, something the world of rock music could not imagine itself without.
B00005JNZ4|1.0|I'm sure not many will appreciate or understand this review. I'm in the minority of people who think that virginity is attractive and sexual humor shouldn't be funny. The immoral, self-focused life style of every character in the movie made it a completely unenjoyable experience for me. Cussack's friend was a disgusting loser but so were the rest - he was simply open about it. Besides the content, the actors (excluding the likable-despite-himself Cussack) were horribly shallow and sad! Diane Lane seemed to think everyone around her was stupid and less than her wonderful self. She couldn't stick with one facial expression, I think in an attempt to be cute and funny(she succeeded in neither). The plot was simple enough - every man for her/himself, trying to make themselves happy. I often tolerate a bit of the risqu&eacute; for a good movie - this one was way over board and made me wonder why I tolerate any ammount of such garbage. The people in front of me walked out about half way through. I regret not doing the same.
6304082428|3.0|I have seen this excellent movie starring Colin Firth, in an unedited version on a six volume set for VHS.  This was available at my local library.  This version show a lot more of the traditional dances and other dialogue scenes that the Special Edition DVD edits out.  I have not found where to buy this unedited version on VHS or DVD.
B00004R99J|5.0|If you can, get a copy of the Gold Classic editions. I dont know if Disney Industries(err studios) plans to continue the line. This contained just enough extras for me! Pocahontas had one of the most beautiful scores ever composed. The story is a bit somber, however. Then life doesnt always guarantee a happy ending. <br /> <br />Speaking of such, now that computer generated movies are generating huge box office returns, has Disney halted its old fashioned, time tested hand drawn classics? The subtle beauty of Snow White, Pinocchio and Fantasia are timeless in my book. Theatrical re-releases would be most appropriate.  There are toddlers out there who would approve,I am sure! <br /> <br />As far as DVD is concerned, simple one disc presentations are priceless in my book! There is plenty of room for trailers and featurettes on the classics. Most importantly, the studio should NOT alter the classics other than improving the colors! New songs, new singers and (horrors)new sequences are unforgivable. <br /> <br />Maybe Disney should try to focus on a big production like it left off in the 1990s. Musical numbers, likeable heroes, and carefully hand drawn wonders would surely revive the magic!   <br />     <br />
B00099BPOW|5.0|Deutsche Gramophpn hit a winner with this re-release of a 1982 recording featuring Katia Ricciarelli singing Aida and Placido Domingo singing Radames. From the smooth opening prelude by the Cora e Orchestra del Teatro alla Scala, under the direction of Claudio Abbado to the final Gloria all'Egitto, the cast and orchestra strike a prefect balance between voice and instrument in a performance that is spellbinding. It takes no time to warm up here, and the welcome is rich, indeed, as Placido Domingo eases us into the passion of Rademes early on in a truly spectacular Se Quel guerrier io fossi! The singing here from the entire cast is even and easy, and the delivery is balanced. Each singer is comfortably within his and her range and matched in temperament, and this matching is evident from song to song, and none more so than the trio Terzetto: Vieni, o diletta, apressati, sung by Elena Obraztsova (Amneris), Ricciarelli and Domingo. The tendancy to \\"shout\\" one's role can be a killer for singers and this reviewer has commented on that tendency in the past. There is none of that here, which is why this CD comes so strongly recommended. The quality of the CD remaster is superb and the accompanying booklet, while not as complete as I would have preferred - no introduction, no bios, no historical facts -- is adequate as far as it describes what is occurring during each song.
B00005JNEW|3.0|When comparing sports films, some might be able to see why I gave this movie only three stars. But I'm also basing my rating on more than just previous film success weighing in against this one. There were good and bad portions of this production that stabilized my review at three stars, too.<br /><br />Since I'm an optomist (mostly), let's start with the good:<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton was excellent, as always, in his main role as coach Gaines, as was Lucas Black as quarterback Mike Winchell. Both played believable characters and showed the stresses put onto their shoulders by family, friends, and the obsessive townsfolk.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Derek Luke who played Boobie Miles, the #1 running back for this little East Texas town. He rules the playing field until fate strikes him down ...and then the team has to become a real team, relying on the whole and not the individual.<br /><br />But there were some problems with other aspects of this movie that soured its possible five star glory.<br /><br />Most notably was Tim McGraw's character, who played a washed up drunken father who'd won a Texas State Championship ring during his formative high school years. Initially, I didn't have a problem with Mr. McGraw's performance as he aggressively taunts his son, trying to make him become the \\"perfect\\" player. He's not a very nice character, and I think that's the way it should have stayed. But the ending tried to candy-coat him and his son's relationship, and that made the entire portion of Mr. McGraw's portrayal unbelievable. At least it did that for me.<br /><br />I also feel that the David and Goliath battles have been overdone in film noir (ad nauseum). Although some of them (see below) are adequate to the situation being filmed, I felt this movie went a bit over-the-top.<br /><br />I've mentioned other famous sports films that I feel are much better than this one, and will probably hold up better over time. #1 among them is Hoosiers, the infamous Indiana basketball movie staring Gene Hackman. #2 would be Raging Bull ('nough said). #3 would be Rocky (the original Rocky, not the sequels). #4 is the lesser known Mystery Alaska, which I found to be extremely funny and heart-warming.<br /><br />I'm sure some reviewers out there have different favorites, and when compared against this film, I'm sure they might see how this one was quite a bit weaker than their other coveted sports movies.<br /><br />That's how I see it anyway ...famous Indiana basketball movie staring Gene Hackman. #2 would be Raging Bull ('nough said). #3 would be Rocky (the original Rocky, not the sequels). #4 is the lesser known Mystery Alaska, which I found to be extremely funny and heart-warming.  <br /> <br />I'm sure some reviewers out there have different favorites, and when compared against this film, I'm sure they might see how this one was quite a bit weaker than their other coveted sports movies.  <br /> <br />That's how I see it anyway ...
B00004ZD69|5.0|Best music of the new millenium. Brilliant enough to challenge some of the greatest works of avant-garde and classical music.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Nine Inch Nails has always been a top quality project, since it is hard to call NIN a band.  Trent Reznor has always experimented with different styles of music, from rap (\\"Down With It\\" off Pretty Hate Machine, released in 1989) to tear-eyed ballads (\\"Hurt\\" off The Downward Spiral, released in 1994) to strong metal (most of the Broken EP, released in 1992).  Let everyone just say that Nine Inch Nails has done it all.  Now in 2005, sixteen years after they released Pretty Hate Machine, Mr. Reznor and Company gives us \\"With Teeth\\", a combination of all of the previous Nine Inch Nails works. <br /> <br />The album fires off in a different way than the older works.  \\"All The Love In The World\\" starts from the get-go with Trent singing along to a nice line, which transforms to a piano in which people can dance to.  The album then goes heavy, with \\"You Know Who You Are\\", in which Trent yells out the chrous, with profanity, along Dave Grohl's upmost superb drummming. <br /> <br />\\"The Collector\\", which is the third track, explodes out with Mr. Grohl still drumming.  \\"The Collector\\" is not as good as some of the other songs on the album, but it is better than a large percent of modern rock.  \\"The Collector\\" then fades into the first single, and one of the catchiest songs on the album, \\"The Hand That Feeds\\".  \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" has a very catchy rhythm that fits in with Trent's singing.  The song can also be remixed by owners of Apple's \\"Garageband\\" program. <br /> <br />The fifth song, \\"Love Is Not Enough\\", is a drop in quality compaired to the songs that came before it.  This is the worst song on the album, but people will still like it.  \\"Love Is Not Enough\\" fades into one of the best songs released by Nine Inch Nails.  \\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\\" is a complete 180 degree turn from the five songs that came before it.  Sing along with the chorus, it is the best part of the song.  The piano at the beginning catches the attention, then the drumming and Trent's singing keeps a hold on the listener for the entire song until the fade into the next track. <br /> <br />\\"With Teeth\\" is, obviously, the title track and a good one.  The only thing that gets annoying is the \\"With-a Teeth-a\\" part. <br /> <br />The next song, \\"Only\\", is a current single that has one of the most creative videos in the last few years.  The Eighties and Pretty Hate Machine returns in \\"Only\\" with spoken words until the chorus.  Listen good with this song and you will find a few surprises, such as the piano at the beginning.  \\"Getting Smaller\\" is a reminisce of today's rock, in short words, it is pretty bland.  \\"Sunspots\\" is a crown jewel in the album.  It reminds me of NIN's previous works. <br /> <br />The last three tracks all fades into each other and are some of the best of the album.  \\"The Line Begins To Blur\\" starts with a big drum line then completely goes the other direction.  This keeps on going with \\"Besides You In Time\\", which has some of the best singing by NIN.  That fades into the best song on the album, \\"Right Where It Belongs\\".  This saddening piece of art is \\"Hurt\\", only shorter and not as famous. <br /> <br />With Teeh, or without, this album is going to entertain fans until the next Nine Inch Nails album.
B00099BPP6|3.0|This is a 2005 2-CD release of a 1964 recording of Rigoletto, featuring the talents of Carlo Bergonzi, singing the role of the Duke, Renata Scotto singing Gilda and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau singing Rigoletto. By now, anyone who owns this recording has formed his or her own opinion about the interpretation of the role of Gilda by Ms. Scotto. I found her voice almost too overwhelming and \\"earthy\\" for such a vulnerable character as Gilda, although she does hit some incredible highs in her Caro Nome and demonstrates a wonderfully smooth ability to glide into the higher scale with what appears to be effortless ease. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's voice on the other hand is saturated with emotion and in the manner of its delivery it evokes empathy for the character. Carlo Bergonzi, too, seems the right fit for the role. His voice contains just the right amount of arrogance and swagger that you would expect from the Duke. Alas, the only singer out of place, it seems, is Ms. Scotto, not because she is ill-equipped, but rather because her voice may lack the vulnerability and innocence of the character that is Gilda. Still, this is a fine 2-CD set -- and it pays to remember that one reviewer's opinion of one aspect of a recording does not make it so for all listeners. The orchestra, Coro e Orchestra del Teatro alla Scala, under the direction of Rafael Kubelik is flawless, as is the overall quality of this Deutsche Grammophon release. The booklet that comes with this set contains bare bones information limited to the order of songs and featured singers and not much else.
B000A59PMO|2.0|Veronica Mars, a teenager at a high school where the wealthy send their teens, is helping solve private investigations through her father's PI business (he's also the former Sheriff of the area.) They live in a fictitious town known as Neptune, California.<br /><br />On top of this, Veronica has to deal with the strife of her classmates (who are much better off than herself), the fact that she comes from a broken home (her mother left her father and her), and try to avoid the local turf wars in her corner of the world.<br /><br />Sounds like a winner, doesn't it?<br /><br />But there are several problems with the basic premise of this series that I just couldn't get my mind around.<br /><br />First (and DEFINITELY foremost) is that the children of millionaires DO NOT go to public schools. They go to private schools. Why would they mingle with the lower classes when they don't have to? The simple answer is that they never would.<br /><br />Secondly, there were a bunch of little things that could've been fixed but weren't. For instance, Veronica gets the headlights of her car bashed in by a rich punk. Then the next scene shows her driving down the street at night ...WITH THE HEADLIGHTS ON! Some might argue that she got them fixed, but let's remember that she and her father are not that well off.<br /><br />Thirdly, Sheriffs are not assigned to \\"towns\\"; they patrol and enforce the law in counties. And Neptune is a city/town. Little things like this shows me how poorly the script writers researched various aspects for the show. And these oversights easily seeped into almost all aspects of the series.<br /><br />And the one aspect of the show that I felt most curious and drawn to -- that being the father/daughter/mother relationship -- was never fully explored. Now I know that this will be a culminating factor in the series, but I felt that too much time was spent on Veronica's high school life and not enough on her home life. A better balance was definitely needed.<br /><br />For better series' look toward Wonderfalls or Dead Like Me.nitely needed. <br /> <br />For better series' look toward Wonderfalls or Dead Like Me.
0811826848|5.0|I love this book. But I have got two major bugbears with it. The first one is the way they whitewash over some of most interesting events - the break-up for example is nowhere near as prickly as some other books describe it. But to hear the Beatles talk about the events through their own eyes is great - even more so for Ringo and George, because their biographies weren't very detailed.  <br />The other problem I have with it is that it just focuses on the history - it hasn't even got a proper discography at the back. I would have enjoyed some reproductions of the covers, for example, and some information about chart placings. I would also have enjoyed some more quotes and memories from the other people involved. <br />But these are all minor points - I do love the book, and I thoroughly recommend it to everyone.
B000069CWE|4.0|After a showstopping debut back in 2000, Linkin Park was unstoppable especially when \\"In The End\\" was released as a single.  They released \\"Reanimation\\", the complete opposite of \\"Hybrid Theory\\", in short, a remix album. Now, it may of been a few years ever since Reanimation was released, but I am reviewing it. <br /> <br />1 - \\"Opening\\" - The intro into this twisted piece.  This may be the only normal minute on the album.  Rating: N/A. <br /> <br />2 - \\"Pts. Of Athrty\\" (feat. Jay Gordon) - This song was the only single off \\"Reanimation\\" and it had a helluva video (remember the one with the two robot armies?) but it can get old after a while.  Good song, though. Rating: 78/100%. <br /> <br />3. \\"Enth E Nd\\" (feat. Kutmasta Kurt & Motion Man) - The evil twin of \\"In The End\\", this rap focused remix can get people grooving, but like the former song, it gets old after a while. Rating: 82/100% <br /> <br />4. \\"Chali\\" - Just a phone call with Chali 2na of Jurassic 5.  Bleh. Rating: N/A. <br /> <br />5. \\"Frgt-10\\" (Alchemist & Chali 2na) - A nice beat with some distortion and nice bass at the beginning with a semi-muted sound clip then Shinoda busts in and raps some more.  The Chali 2na part is the best. The only thing bad is the noise at the end. Rating: 87/100% <br /> <br />6. \\"P5hng Me A*wy\\" (Mike Shinoda & Stephen Richards) - Very dark and electronica-ish.  Kind of repetive and some sounds feel out of place. This remix could have been way better: Rating: 71/100%. <br /> <br />7. \\"Plc 4 Mie Haed\\" (Amp Live & Zion On Zion I) - This remix is a song for grooving.  It sounds like they attempted Industrial at times. The guest rapping is excellent.  Rating: 92/100%. <br /> <br />8. \\"X-ecutioner Style\\" (The X-ecutioners & Black Thought) - Mainly a mix of clips from other Linkin Park songs with the superb turntablism of the X-ecutioners.  The guest rapping is the best on the entire album.   Rating: 99/100%. <br /> <br />9. \\"H! Vltg3\\" (Evidence, DJ Babu, & Pharoahae Monch) - A remix of \\"High Voltage\\" off Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid Theory EP\\", if you never heard the original, you should, its a little better than this.  The remix is the complete opposite of the original.  Rating: 75/100%. <br /> <br />10. \\"Riff Raff\\" - Normal answering machine nonsense. Rating: N/A. <br /> <br />11. \\"Wth>You\\" (Chairman Hahn & Aceyalone) - It sounds a lot like the original but it also features guest rapping from one of the best in the Underground circut.  Rating: 91/100%. <br /> <br />12. \\"Ntr-Mission\\" - A complete saddening piano mix. Only thing bad about this song is that it is short.  Rating: N/A. <br /> <br />13. \\"PPr;Kut\\" (Cheapshot, Jubacca, Rasco, & Planet Asia) - A gigantic mix of great rapping.  The middle of the song has the best parts. Not that much to say. Rating: 93/100%. <br /> <br />14. \\"Rnw@y\\" (Backyard Bangers & Pheonix Orion) - A peaceful remix at the beginning, then the whole song shifts to rap.  Same thing, it is better rap than you hear on MTV today.  One of the best songs on the entire album. Rating: 100/100%. <br /> <br />15. \\"My{Dsmbr\\" - They did not entirely remix the originaly peaceful song.  The thing you hear the most is the beeps and other noises.  They actually made this song better.  Try to listen to the original, you will know what I mean.  Rating: 97/100%. <br /> <br />16. \\"Stef\\" - More random answering machine garbage. Rating: N/A. <br /> <br />17. \\"By_Myslf\\" (Josh Abraham, Mike Shinoda, & Stephen Carpenter) - They gave this song a complete tempo change along with more bass and a different riff.  The remix is alright.  Rating: 79/100%. <br /> <br />18. \\"Kyur4 Th Ich\\" (Chairman Hahn) - I will not even ask how Hahn remixed \\"Cure For The Itch\\".  This is just more turntablism greatness given from one of the best in the genre.  Rating: 98/100%. <br /> <br />The last two songs are instant favorites. <br /> <br />19. \\"1stp Klosr\\" - (The Humble Brothers & Johnathan Davis) - After the long intro (and I mean long), listen to a slowed down version of the first single off \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and how the song should have been.  Rating: 100/100%. <br /> <br />20. \\"Krwlng\\" (Mike Shinoda & Aaron Lewis) - They got the lead singer from Staind to pitch in and they did a great job.  This song is a perfect closer to an whirlwind of an album.  Aaron Lewis does a superb job of singing and the entire song fits together.  A masterpiece.  Rating: 100/100%. <br /> <br />And there you have it, from the beginning of the end, as Linkin Park would say it.
B000092Q4U|3.0|Kind of boring lots of potential her but the band still is learning to write songs.
0670033375|4.0|Having read Guns by Mr. Diamond I had to read Collapse.  I like a lot of what Mr. Diamond said, but in making me think about the subject, I drew a different conclusion.  While societies of different times and places on earth prove the importance of taking care of the land, I got the conclusion that religion and or people's values screwed them up more than anything.  The folks at Easter Island, the ancient ones, even the christian Norse of Greenland all proved that reliance on religion can cause collapse just as well as ignorance of the land.   <br />While Mr. Diamond brought back a favorite read of mine in Malthus while examining Rowanda, he could of used Thorstein Veblen and The Theory of the Leisure class for the Easter island and Norse Greenlanders(that being the lack of big game to hunt, can lead to a reliance on religious icons even if it leads failure.)    <br />When Jared Diamond writes books he throws so much useful information into it.  But when the conclusions don't mesh with the theme of the book, one has to figure the value of the book.  Diamond was brilliant in many parts of the book, and the fact that he doesn't try to explain religion's role in Collapse only gives me a sense that this very smart man wants to stay away from an agruement that's not worth his time.  Read the book, it's more than worth the price on the dust jacket.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Why? Lots of reasons. For one, it's got Christian Bale in the lead role, Michael Caine as the strongest Alfred ever, Rutger Hauer as a Donald Trump lookalike, Morgan Freeman acting about like James Bond's Q, and a bunch of other good talent. That cast just won't let a movie go down the tubes.<br /><br />Except for Batman himself, this doesn't look like a comic book movie, and I mean that in the best way possible. It opens on a grey and gritty prison, then turns into a Himalayan trek, then flirts with Ninja stuff before returning to Gotham. The fight scenes are good, but oddly indistinct. It's not always clear who's doing what to whom, but that's even more effective than standard fight choreography - it reinforces the sense of Batman swooping in unseen on the bad guys, taking them down before they know they've been hit.<br /><br />And Gotham City is good, too. It appears in earlier and later times, with a clear display of decay in between. It's a good vision: tall, sweeping Art Deco lines, especially in that monorail. Other parts looked like Cubist landscapes, in their organic sprawl. The Plot Device was a disappointment. I won't give it away, but when you see it, think: people are mostly water, too.<br /><br />This one's really good, even if you don't usually like comic book movies. It's got good, varied action, and good characters, or good enough. In a summer of good summer movies, this is about the best so far. Enjoy!<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0000508U6|3.0|Okay, so I've been nice to Coldplay. But after awhile, my mind changed. Parachutes has, in terms of quality, a bit of everything, be it brilliant (Shiver, Yellow, High Speed, Everything's Not Lost) or boring (Sparks, Trouble, We Never Change). So is this worth a purchase? That depends. Are you the patient kind, willing to slog through several tracks of filler to get to the brilliance? If so, by all means go after it. If not, that's what downloading's for.
0312995423|1.0|I have spent many years working for the government with people who possess high clearances (top secret and higher) and this is what I have to say about the book: <br /> <br />1.  Haven't finished it yet.  I'm around page 300 and something and I may finish it out of morbid curiosity. <br /> <br />2.  I'm still trying to figure out what the physical attractiveness of the protagonists has to do with anything. <br /> <br />3.  The dialogue is full of sexual innuendo and there's a high degree of overt sexual harassment that seems to be going on which, in the real world, would almost never happen. <br /> <br />4.  Susan Fletcher is an idiot.  There is no indication in the portrayal of her character why she is considered brilliant.  <br /> <br />5.  The character Hale would never be allowed within 10 miles of the NSA in reality. <br /> <br />If all the people in the story were portrayed as realistic people in this industry, I would find the story of their inner struggles riveting as the story unfolds. <br /> <br />Very disappointed.
B00005JNZ4|5.0|I enjoyed this lovely romantic comedy and have recommended it to all of my friends. <br /> <br />I've loved Diane Lane since Under the Tuscan Sun and her performance pleases in this movie as well. <br /> <br />John Cuzack is an extremely lovable character. <br /> <br />I think it would be a very cute date movie. <br /> <br />Take a gals night out and go see it!
B000088E6D|5.0|My husband and I were surprised to learn that all our children (aged 16, 21, 23, 26) and both our parents all have this cd in their collections. I guess that speaks to the Mr. Buble's fine work and our family good taste!  <br />We couldn't choose just one song as best as they are all so well done. I had mentioned in a review of his newest cd It's time that he is such a personable and professional entertainer and we wish him only continued success. <br />Buble music is music to all our ears.
B000001ESP|5.0|This is definitely a classic in rock and roll. Rush tones down the progressive side of their music for shorter, catchier tunes but remain just as good. Also one will notice that there are a few more synths than on previous albums. If you hate synths then this is bad news but i feel they help enhance the album. I am sure everyone who listens to classic rock radio knows Tom Sawyer,Limelight,and Red Barchetta. Red Barchetta is a personal favorite because of the intro. It consists of soft guitar sounds and you can practically feel a cool breeze running through your hair in the morning. Witch Hunt is also good, very dark for a Rush song. The synth sound are particularly creepy. And the closer Vital Signs rules it is very reggae-ish. Fans of the Police may want to check this song out. <br /> <br />And then of course there is The Camera Eye. Eleven minutes of musical genius in my opinion. Probably the last progressive song Rush ever did. Cool synth intro (remember it is 1981) that soon explodes into a nice rocker. And how can we forget the instrumental YYZ? One of the most well-known instrumentals in classic rock? Maybe... <br /> <br />Definitely a must-own for fans of Rush and classic rock.
0679720200|2.0|This is one of those books that you come across in your life that people talk about and mention to you a few times and eventually you get around to reading it.  Since it's only about 123 pages long, it is definitely a quick read.  The storyline goes at a good pace and there's just enough happening to keep you interested in the plot.<br /><br />Most people I've talked to about this book didn't care for the lack of details.  That didn't bother me so much.  The only reason that I am not giving this book a better review is because of my frustration with the main character.  If Mersault would just CARE about something, anything, the outcome of this story would be so much different.  Sure, this is the point the author is trying to get across, but still.  I found Mersault's stand-offish attitude to be very frustrating.<br /><br />This is definitely one of those books that you want to discuss with a friend when you are finished, so be sure that if you grab this book, grab another copy for a friend as well.
B0002WYS6S|4.0|As much as I love the greatest band on EARTH, removing the stage monitors has RUINED the forceful projection of James Labrie's amazing operatic-trained voice. A perfect show, minus one member, so 4 stars. Watch and buy \\"Live in Tokyo\\" 1992, and listen to James. It is not necessary for him to sound like Geddy Lee in the old days...but HIS VOICE IS THE FIFTH INSTRUMENT. YES is a classic example with Jon Anderson. I was looking forward to hearing the POWER of James' voice, but technology killed this live album- but ONLY on the vocals. <br /> The DVD is exciting nonetheless, and the band's strict adherence to their own obsessiveness is evident, yet not suprising, not as pathetic as RUSH for example, specifically the rudeness and egomania of Neal Peart. They love their fans, and unlike RUSH, someday I think DT will be making home videos available!!! <br /> The extra's are worth the entire package, and the concert is perfection, which I preferred in standard front-channel sound. I am glad James sounded better in Phoenix and Tucson recently. WAY TO GO!!!!!
0767805712|5.0|This story illustrates that true success can be achieved through perseverance and patience, and not necessarily due to inborn traits.
B00018D44U|5.0|It's truly rare in this day and age to hear such a simple, classic, classy piece of work. Jones isn't simple retreading the same ground as her predecesors. Her deep and soulful voice puts every American Idol-belting teenybopper to shame, and the album's rich and vibrant production is at once mind-expanding and hypnotic, thought-provoking yet wistfully and delightfully chill. Without a doubt one of the best albums of the twenty-first century.
1573223026|1.0|I thought the concept for this story was intriguing. As I read the book, however, I was disappointed in that I didn't feel engaged by the characters, and found them difficult to relate to. While the story line described the reasons for each characters' suicidal ideation, there wasn't enough emotional content to fit the narrative - thus it seemed lacking. Further, I agree w/ one aspect of the review in the Chicago Tribune in that the author doesn't alter his writing style significantly to distinguish between the characters.  I read this with a book club of 4 other people, none of whom would recommend the book.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I have seen enough. How many of you have been DT fans since 1991? I HAVE. The band took the world upon it's shoulders- literally- to bear the weight as the Greatest Rock Band on Earth. EVERY SINGLE album sans \\"Live: AT Budokan\\", has been a piece apart, clever, precise, eccentric, bombastic, revolutionary, outrageous, spontaneous, and with a tad of humor and utterly amazing self-indulgence. DT is SO smart, they are FULLY aware they are pulling everyone's string, except for the most \\"devoted\\", who REALLY look for the magic pearl in every priceless melody. <br /> John Petrucci pretty well says it all in the final lyrics on this amazing project: \\"The story ends where it began...\\", and sure enough, and only one other reviewer even seemed to notice- \\"Octavarium\\" reprised the beginning of \\"The root of all Evil.\\" In addition, \\"The root of all Evil\\" climaxes with passages directly from the arrangement in \\"Octavarium.\\" DT is so intelligent as a band, they love to tease, and if you listened instead of \\"expecting\\"...you would fine little gemstones of absolute magic throughout this magnificent Magnum Opus. <br /> John Petrucci's guitar work is stunning. Some of his finest work on chord progression and tones I have never heard from his instrument. John Myung- what can I say- every album he is a genius. Jordan Rudess actually pulls out some solos more reminicent of Wakeman/Emerson, but just ever-so-slightly. Mike Portnoy is the biggest surpise of all! Laying low, it's almost like he is using brushes on parts of \\"Octavarium\\", with perfect timing on that massive drum package!!! For Mike to \\"tame his shrewd\\", is just absolutely necessary on this project. <br /> The vocals of James LaBrie are not \\"stellar\\" because his \\"pipes\\" aren't really the \\"fifth\\" instrument here, except on the title track and \\"Root of all Evil.\\" Basically, he is just calm and relaxed. Again, for the album itself, it was necessary. <br /> I am sick of all the comparisons. Although DT has NEVER hidden their influences, people keep comparing, yet no one on the PLANET can come close to this musical machine. I have never seen such a mass of pathetic reviews mixed in with thoughtful and intelligent reviews in my life! I don't mind negative reviews, but save it for the bands you are comparing DT to. Don't insult this band nor it's core of REAL fans who live by their sound and vision. <br /> \\"Octavarium\\" is a monsterous and superb album. By the way, DT has done a 42- minute opus and a near 80- minute opus in addition to these 20- minute tunes we have heard. To them, 20 minutes is a piece of cake. Go buy the album. Put on the headset. LISTEN. Be amazed.
B00005JNEI|1.0|After watching this documentary, I had the following impressions: <br /> <br />The only good point made was the critique pertaining to getting rid of Saddam Hussein.  The rest of documentary is TOTAL NONSENSE. <br /> <br />Athiban Thamban

B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has been undeniably one of the greatest and most popular bands of the mid-90's, and now the 2000's.  The band has obviously matured as far as there music, as \\"American Idiot\\" has displayed in comparison with their previous albums.  It seems that their previous works were fun to listen and jam to, but American Idiot takes them and the listener to a whole new level.   <br /> <br />Complex and incredibly catchy melodies dominate this album, anyone who appreciates true rock music has to be a fan of the music written by the band on this cd.  I found it impossible to find a song I disliked, and it is seriously addicting.  Although Green Day's music has always been respectable, a brilliant mix of guitar and bass solos and obviously awesome drum patterns, \\"American Idiot\\" seems to be a \\"toned down\\" and perhaps classier version of their punk rock.  What comes out is almost a different Green Day style, complimented beautifully by what has become poetry from Billie Joe Armstrong.   <br /> <br />The themes, motifs, symbols and other poetic devices used in the lyrics, featuring the \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"St. Jimmy\\", along with others, make them seem like your listening to crafted poetry, and like a lot of famous poets, some of the words are anarchical.  Overall, this is the greatest album from one of the most popular bands of our time.  This is truly Green Day's Master Piece.
B000003TA9|5.0|now first off if your are new to sonic youth or you want to check them out i actually say get this over \\"daydream nation\\" or \\"sister\\" this is a great album and u can hear the major difference of what being signed to a major label does. this is the easiest sonic youth album to find by far. now to the real purpose i wrote this review this cd is great dont get me wrong, but i much rather prefer the stoner-noise-confusion-riot-mayhem sound of \\"bad moon rising\\" or \\"confusion is sex/kill yr idols\\" to this if you have heard sonic youth before and you love the sons were they go into the weird noises and odd guitar work and tunings than totally go buy those two cds listed previously. sonic youth is one of the best bands ever, and dont put them out till you give them a chance they rule!
B0002RNXNM|5.0|Kasabian is one of the best groups to come out of the UK in the past few years.  I simply cannot get enough of this cd.  The band's sound is original and the songs are so catchy, making it an awesome debut cd.  <br /> <br />Here's how I would rate the various songs: <br /> <br />Club Foot (9/1o) <br />Great song,  it was an excellent pick for radio single.  One of the best songs on the album, good sond to start off the cd <br /> <br />Processed Beats (8/1o) <br />Almost as good as that last one, the only reason it doesn't score as high is because it doesn't have as many lyrics. <br /> <br />Reason Is Treason (8.5/1o) <br />What can I say, I love it.  Stays in your head all day. <br /> <br />I.D.  (6.5/1o) <br />It's not as great as the songs preceding it.  A bit slow and not very 'sing-a-longable.'  Not much in terms of lyrics, but still not a bad song. <br /> <br />L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forever) (1o/1o) <br />Easily the best song on the album.  So catchy, so brilliant.  It is a true testament of what Kasabian is capable of at their best.  I cannot say enough about this song it is just SO GOOD. <br /> <br />Running Battle (9/1o) <br />Another hit.  Friggin awesome.  I don't know what else to say <br /> <br />Test Transmission (7.5/1o) <br />A near miss.  The chorus is pretty good, but what ruins the songs are the wierd verses.  It is also one of the slower songs.  It's not bad, but not a \\"oh skip to track 7 I can't wait to hear that song\\" song. <br /> <br />Cutt Off  (9.5/10) <br />Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant.  My second favourite song <br /> <br />Butcher Blues (8/1o) <br />Its good.  Very catchy.  Yeah. <br /> <br />U Boat (7/1o) <br />Not bad, not good.  Very (...).  Not a very good ending song... <br /> <br />Apart from the three lowest scoring songs This is an amazing Cd.   I strongly recommend it.  BUYBUYBUY. :D
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I'm glad that I haven't purchased that movied but rented  <br />to see whether it is really good as some folks gave great reviews for that.  <br /> <br />I'll tell you honestly it was a waste of money! <br />This movie is the most stupid movie I have ever seen considering that it is a new release and that some idiots gave a good review for that. No offense but only idiots can rate it as a funny movie. <br /> <br />I was waiting for something funny during the whole movie but unfortunately that \\"something\\" never happened. There is one idiot guy named \\"Napoleon\\" who pretends to be a cool or funny guy. In fact he is not! He doesn't even deserve to be called an \\"idiot\\".  <br /> <br />If you don't believe me please rent this movie and decide for yourself! I can tell you, I watched this movie with three other people in the room but none of us was excited about it. I said \\"what the heck is it\\", where are those jokes mentioned by good reviews? And all 3 of us have good sense of humor, we are not idiots. But when you watch this movie you think that movie director treated you like you're an idiot.  <br /> <br />It doesn't deserve even 1 star. I honestly woudn't pay for this movie even $1. This movies is a good present to someone you want to humiliate. Thanks!
B000002GQG|5.0|Like a gangbuster, I'm going to approach my review of Lost Chord by getting directly into the album tracks with my sleeves rolled up.  Yes, you know you're in for something more cosmic than Chord's predecessor, Days of Future Passed immediately with Graeme Edge's somewhat puzzling recitation of the poem Departure before it segues quite nicely into \\"Ride My See-Saw,\\" a song that seems to be a leftover from DOFP in content.  For years I have liked this great harmony heavy, catchy pop single, but now I see that the lyrics have very much in common with the working day theme from the previous album, and really understand it's meaning now more than I ever have:<br /><br />\\"Left school with a first class pass<br /><br />Started work but as second class<br /><br />School taught one and one is two<br /><br />But right now that answer just ain't true.\\"<br /><br />Yes, so much for that idyllic concept of graduating and experiencing the real world once you find out that landing the job of your dreams isn't going to be that easy.  In essence, we're all riding that see-saw and looking for a way off, someone else to take our place so we can find something better.<br /><br />\\"See-Saw\\" is followed up by Ray Thomas's \\"Dr. Livingstone, I Presume, which carries the concept of searching for something a bit further.  The song is one of Ray's typically playful, bouncy, and very British sounding compositions that deals with very successful careermen who, though they have had luck in their fields, are still unfulfilled.  \\"I've still not found what I'm looking for...We're all looking for someone.\\"  So on it goes.<br /><br />This is where we get into the eastern spirituality and exploration that inevitably put the Moodies into the unenviable position of musical gurus for people who didn't realize the band was asking as many questions as they were.  \\"House of Four Doors\\" is a spritual quest for inner peace, and as each door opens, you are supposed to get deeper into your personal \\"core.\\"  I'm not sure I have ever understood the Hindu philosophy of spirituality, but I definitely appreciate all the sophisticated musical passages each door creak involves, complete with that Beach Boys chorus so prominently displayed.  In the center of this piece sits the piece de resistance, \\"Legend of a Mind,\\" a somewhat whimsical ode to Timothy Leary, the man who gave us LSD.  I have always enjoyed this song, as I think it's singularly better than anything on the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper album, even if I don't condone the use of hallucinogenics.  This song is brilliant in every way, and the best thing about it is Ray Thomas's Native American sounding flute.<br /><br />This long concept song is followed up by Justin Hayward's gorgeous \\"Voices in the Sky,\\" in which he seems to be longing for the freedom of a singing bird or the innocence of children skipping rope in the middle of some sort of emotional bout he's experiencing.  Lovely and full of simple yearning, it's easy to see why this has long been a favorite among Moodies fans.<br /><br />Mike Pinder offers us a very Lennon-esque sounding \\"The Best Way to Travel\\" as we seem to be going back and forth between the DOFP concept and moving onto more of a spiritual hippie vibe.<br /><br />The Hayward/Lodge composition \\"Visions of Paradise\\" has rather nonsensical lyrics that sound like an acid trip, which is quite beautiful and (sorry) groovy, only made moreso by the enhancement of sitar from Justin and Ray Thomas's beautiful birdlike flute.  This is truly a tranquil and captivating piece of music.<br /><br />\\"The Actor\\" is another beautifully crafted ballad by Justin Hayward about hiding feelings of great loss for a broken love.  While it carries a similar feel of strong longing to \\"Nights in White Satin\\" it isn't quite as stirring as the former, but it still carries a lot of power.<br /><br />Graeme Edge then reveals in his poem \\"The Word\\" that the lost chord is called \\"Om,\\" the final track on the album.  This is unmistakably asong designed for transcendental meditation and, while a seemingly dated concept, the song is still hypnotic and captivating.  The harmonies are beautiful, and Justin Hayward's  quickly learned mastery of the sitar is to be highly commended.  Each time I play this album I love it more and more.  It is one of the best of the \\"core seven\\" albums, but I don't think it's a good idea to skip any of them.  As far as Lost Chord goes, however, I have only one word to describe it:  Heaven.esigned for transcendental meditation and, while a seemingly dated concept, the song is still hypnotic and captivating.

B00005JNSK|4.0|Willy's back, and of course with Depp and Burton things have changed.  Some for the better and some for the worse, as is often the case.  Oh, and to clarify now, the film is not actually that dark.    The plot itself feels a little awry.  For instance, Charlie is treated almost as a sub-character for much of the film, and we are pressed to pay more and more attention to the factory and Willy Wonka himself.  This is particularly true when Burton shows us the newer personal side of Wonka, filled with flashbacks and more.    On top of that the whole feel of the musical has diminished, but admittedly they're just not as popular anymore so no surprise.  Oh yes, the Oompaloompas sing, and in quite a  variety of styles too, but don't expect Depp to crack out a note, or the kids.    And speaking of Oompaloompas, in the previous versions where obviously a few characters played them, this version has one actor digitally cloned into all of the Oompaloompas.  Not only that, but he is not the most appealing Oompaloompa, as he actually fits the image of a man who I do not think should be around kids.  Oh yes, I definitely loved the musical numbers, and the shrewd comments based around them particularly by the kid characters, but still, scary man.    So did I like it?  Yeah, I did, and although I prefer Gene Wilder's version this one gives us another side, perhaps unnecessary side, to this strange yet classic tale of a poor boy and his fortunate and strange trip to the Wonka Chocolate factory.

B000002H2H|5.0|Classic Metallica, classic Metal.  This album is a great one.  If you like Heavy Metal and don't already have this, definitely buy it.  And if you like Metallica, make sure you pick up their other classics, Metallica Metallica, ...And Justice For All, and Master of Puppets.  They will not disappoint.
B000000OQF|4.0|why are people seriously still reviewing this album?    it's a great album. now go review something else and leave this one alone. some albums just don't need to be constantly reviewed with 'full track analysis'. some albums are just good. period.
B000002H97|5.0|What are you waiting for?  This album is excellent from front to back.  Definitely classic Metallica, and classic Metal.  There are 12 reasons to get this album.  Track one is one reason, track two is another reason, all the way to track 12.  This is one of those \\"just put it in and press play\\" albums.  No filler here.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album.  If you have more money left, get Master of Puppets, ...And Justice For All, and Ride the Lightning too.  Then you will have yourself a nice little Metal collection.
0156027321|5.0|It is rare that I read a fiction book that is not Fantasy/Sci-fi. Having read the reviews on Amazon regarding the Life of Pi, I decided to pick it up. The cover was intriguing, and the story seemed like quite an adventure.<br /><br />What an adventure it was!<br /><br />The Life of Pi was a quick, and pleasurable read. When I set the book down after 3 days I wished that there more more to read, or a sequel. Yann Martel sets up for himself quite a standard with this soon to be classic.<br /><br />Regardless of what style of fiction you enjoy, please consider this book. It is easy to read, a pleasure to read, and a wonderful story of a boy on a spiritual and personal journey through tragedy.

0743455967|5.0|4.5 stars rounded up to 5. \\"On Writing\\" is an informative book on the craft of writing, as well as being chock full of autobiographical insights from the life of Stephen King. Why 4.5 stars? While I enjoyed the autobiographical aspects, many were out of place in a book about writing. I did enjoy the glimpses into Mr. King's life, believe me, but they were unexpected and interfered somewhat with the hunger I had for the knowledge he was sharing.<br /><br />Having read this book after not being a Stephen King reader, I can say without a doubt I would enjoy reading his full autobiography. I just wish it hadn't been included in \\"On Writing.\\"<br /><br />Stephen King has a lot of real world experience, and I find myself re-reading the portions of the book having to do with writing style and editing, and wishing there was less biography. A must have for writers at any level, an inspiration even if you aren't a King fan, and a nice semi-autobiography for fans who are not interested in the craft of writing.

B000009ED0|2.0|The only good song kid rock ever did is bawwitabaw the rest of the songs he has done suck.  But bawwitabaw is such a good song that it brings one of the worst albums ever (aside from that song of course) up to two stars
B00005JNZ4|2.0|I thought I was going to really enjoy this one, but found it to be a very shallow story overall.  John Cusack was good in his role, but the story itself was a disappointment.  Plenty of sexual references, really trite and unappealing.  Wouldn't see it a second time.
B00005Q66T|5.0|There is so much going on on this one CD! It shows parts of diffrent madonna eras and u really see that, because the songs don't match eachother. You see how various Madonna is. Erotica is sensual and Music is funky. Frozen is mysterious and Ray Of Light isbouncy. i could continue this way, just get this amazing album. So many hits, and it comes froma  great artist. Thrust me, you'll love this diamond.

B000002LGQ|5.0|For the first time Madonna makes a more serious record! Not only dance songs, but also very emotional ballads! This also is all about your family, friends and lovers and relationships. It includes a legendary song, Liek A Prayer. Just for that song u should buy this album. But there's much more. Buy this one, u won't be dissapointed!
B000035Z1Z|5.0|jus finished watchin this on cable... (& added it to my wish list, too) <br /> <br />not a bad movie... <br /> <br />(what more you expeckin me to say? go on and read erbody else's reviews already!) <br /> <br />kevin kline's accent is HORRIBLE tho... the movie's only flaw. <br />
B000002LND|5.0|All songs on this album are fabulous. They becomebetter and better when the album plays. You hear madonna evoluating to the queen of pop af the end. Strong melodies, catchy beats. Songs that are timeless. They were all hits. It's a must-have compilation. Thrust me, it0s very hard to not like this masterpiece!
B00001MXXG|5.0|That word pretty much sums this movie up.  It was Matthew Broderick's best, other than Godzilla of course (kidding.  Kidding.), but really that's all I can say about it.  If you don't have this movie, buy it.  If you haven't ever even seen this movie... what's wrong with you?
B000002NJS|5.0|What an album! It sounds so fresh and modern! Probably the best madonna album. it includes all the latest tunes and funny sounds. It's also very variated, but still the songs match eachother. There are beautoful ballads, but also groovy dancesongs. And mid-tempo tracks. You must buy this one! Every music lover will love this materpiece! Good lyrics, strong melodies and deep beats!
B0000A98ZP|4.0|This is basically one of the greatest portrayals of the teenager's high school life.  Each different perspective and yet how they all attract and connect with eachother is amazing.  Well done movie, well done acting, I even liked the purposefully stagnant setting.
B000002MUW|5.0|Madonna goes R&B. Great album! Good beats and nice background vocals! It sounds sexy, sad and dissing. Madonna's voice is gorgous and the album is really relaxt. You can play it anytime. Lots of mid-tempo songs. 11 magnificant tracks and mysterious!
B000957O82|3.0|Hitch is one of those movies youll watch once. From the adds it look hilarious, but when you get to watching it its not much. Its about a date doctor called Hitch (Will Smith), who helps people make it to their first kiss. He, just like his clients, has problems with women. He doesn't want to get committed. But one day he meets a lady whos also not wanting to get committed, and they begin going on. On the side of this Kevin James's character meets this famous and rich person and needs help getting her to notice him, so he calls up Hitch. The funny parts are with Kevin James and  and sometimes with Will Smith, but really, there's not many parts youll laugh at. So save your money, and dont buy this. Just rent it.
B00005T5VE|5.0|This packiage is needed! Because the CD is such a good one it deserves this package!
0312323859|5.0|i found this book to be one that i could not put down and finished it in less than 2 days... <br /> <br />why?  for starters, the protagonist is such an awful, nasty, hate-inspiring, spoiled little twit that, much like rubber-necking at a car accient, you feel sucked in to her terrible lifestyle and want to see what's coming to her.  i found myself appalled, again and again, at darcy's behavior.  she is a very unlikeable character... <br /> <br />BUT--giffin manages to save her and to turn her readers to rooting for darcy.  it's truly an amazing accomplishment. <br /> <br />this book is fluffy and fun and it ends quite nicely.  there are a few unexpected turns from about page 250 on... <br /> <br />highly recommended!!
B000002N3J|5.0|All ballads on tis compilation are diffrent. It shows the variation of Madonna! Sometime she sings low and soft while other times her voice could break your windows of highness! Each ballad is something to remmeber, the name suits the compilation well!
6305327084|5.0|This film is the wonderful story of a character simply known as \\"Reunion Classmate #2\\".  A semi-popular high-schooler who meets up with the most popular girl in school, Darien Smalls, at their high school reunion.  The meeting at the raffle ticket table is a soft portrayal of long-lost love and \\"moving on\\" with life.  The actor's portrayal of his realization that he has grown up is an magnum opus of quality character acting.  A must see for this scene alone. [submitted by Matthew Nathan Castens]
B00008S2VG|5.0|I don't understand those bad reviews. Those people are to dumb enough to understand Madonna's message. This album rocks!
1881273156|5.0|Well worth the read. It is vitally important not just to learn what  languages you and your partner speak when it comes to love, but to accept those differences and learn to manage them.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|This band is a collection of talent and this album, in my humble opinion, is their most solid effort ever and I have known of this band since \\"pull me under\\" like many of you.<br /><br />Sacrificed sons and Ill walk beside you (nice surprise) are the most solid tracks with these walls a close third.
0790731894|4.0|Seagal is truly at his best in this film, he dies 20 minutes into it.  This is the story of terrorists that take control of a flight heading to the U.S. and have loaded it full of explosives and chemicals that will essentially wipe out the entire east coast.   <br /> <br />Kurt Russel plays the terror expert that takes over for the Delta Force crew when their leader (Seagal) dies as the stealth fighter they are using to board the plane detaches and explodes. <br /> <br />This is essentially one of those action movies that seemed cool to watch but not very credible.  That is until 9/11 happened which makes this movie only a little more believable.

0312323859|5.0|I too HATED Darcy in the first book and was skeptical of reading a book all about her but it was actually really good! Her character really comes a long way in this book. I was teary eyed at the ending and I thought the last couple chapters were truly \\"moving\\" because I really got into the characters. The ending was great and I am hoping for a follow up book!
