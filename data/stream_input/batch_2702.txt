B009WUAK2M|5.0|This movie had all the greats in it and was worth watching. Can't wait for my husband to see it he will love it.
B00B37RYMQ|5.0|EASY TO ACCESS CHAPTERS OF RELEVANCE TO THE PROFESSOR AND BECAUSE IT'S ON MY KINDLE NO WORRIES ABOUT TRANSPORTING THE MANY BOOKS AND PLAQYS I NEEDE FOR THESE COURSES OF STUDY...I DO LOVE THIS BOOK!
B00AHHODH2|5.0|I’m not sure what genre this book is, a comedy, a murder mystery or a desperate housewives type of soap book. It doesn’t really fit into any fixed genre. What it is, is funny, not laugh out loud, side holding silliness, but a knowing inner laugh, that plasters a wide grin on your chops. The story of widows, Nazis, assassins and models cover everything in suburbia and all through the women’s dog walking club.<br /> Yes, an all-round good fun book, at times the characters confused me, and I had to check back as to which person had the German shepherd dog and which the boob job, also the introduction, that was repeated, in total, near the end of the book was a tad too long.<br />Jeremy Poole (writer) [...]
B005USZML4|4.0|Loved the characters and storyline.  Please read critique for &#34;Theodore Boone:  The Activist for further information on how I came to read this particular series.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I had been collecting the movies as they came out and kinda fell behind. Great price but, they're all in wide screen.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Another Mahjongg I haven't given a fair amount of time to be able to critique.  Ask me again in 6 months or so.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Fabulous, simple product that converts slides to digital in seconds.  I now have so many projects to complete! Very easy to use!
B007HUD6OS|4.0|When I purchased these Boone books, I did not read enough of the cover to realize they were &#34;young peoples&#34; books.  I went ahead and read them since they were already bought, PLUS, they were by John Grisham, an author I truly respect for his writings.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I was truly surprised and captivated by the characters and the story line.  I (knowing me and reading) will continue to follow this character as long as Mr. Grisham continues to write about him.
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It has been years since a book has grabbed me like this.  I loved The Kite Runner but And the Mountains Echoed exceeds all my expectations.
B005USZYDU|4.0|I purchased this series without doing enough research on the book's subject.  Frankly I saw John Grisham and knew I hadn't read these, so I purchased.  As I got into the book (a few pages) I realized they were geared for young people, but decided to continue since they were already bought.  Of course the writing was excellent....IT was John Grisham after all!  I got hooked by this character and his adventures and continued on to read all of his books (I think).  Look forward to more.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is sooooo fun to play it is like Mario bros. and I love that game. I HIGHLY recommend it.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|This is a young person's book.  Written at their level for their reading pleasure.  Please read the critique for Theodore Boone:  The Activist to get my view on this series,
B0046B3QTG|5.0|We enjoyed this cute and funny story and the little antics of the minions...This is a great movie, a must see...well done!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It's so much fun and the minions are too cute. I wish I could have one in real life.
B00AFPVPDG|1.0|The first 2 chapters were solid advice on how to learn new ideas quickly and safely. The rest of the book is dedicated to providing anecdotal evidence from the author's standpoint on why it works and goes into great detail on what they have learned.<br /><br />As I have no interest (unlike the author) in yoga, GO, or ukeleles, this makes the rest of the book a mostly worthless read.<br /><br />Pros: Two good chapters at the start of the book.<br /><br />Cons: Unless you have similar interests as the author, the rest of the book is useless filler, anecdotal stories, and rehash of the first two chapters.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is just the kind of games I like....excellent graphics...fairly long....and just the right amount of challenge....rad!....that was totally 20 words long before I had to write this....
B000SCHC0Q|3.0|A heart-warming love story about the struggles all women may go through. I just loved this story. Excellent read! Great!
B006MHWXMS|5.0|The integration with Google Task is amazing, I love it. The UI is very clean and minimalistic but at the same time display all the info of what you have to do
0747599874|5.0|The cover was a little worn out but as a whole, very good condition. Overall i found it an amazing book
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its just like subway surfers but even better the minions help you out by swinging you around you get a bonus for bumping into other minions it's awesome
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Got &#34;hooked&#34; on it.  Was addicted to it and could not stop playing.  Need more rooms so I can keep going!
052118939X|5.0|This book is wonderful, the pages are high quality and the content is very interesting, i recommend this one for everyone.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy watching how the royalty live.  They experience the same issues that we all encounter.  They are not resilient to  it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was so moving. The love this man showed for this woman. It also brought into lite how selfess we can be for our own needs for our own loved ones.
B004H83IM8|5.0|The Austin Powers collection was a great value for the amount of money paid. I like that is in a single box with all the movies.
0979019710|5.0|I discovered this book accidentally, while in Italy on vacation recently. (I bought the Kindle version). Boy was a amazed at reading it!!!! It came at the perfect time in my life. I had some down time on vacation and was able to reassess the direction my life was headed. TMM really woke me up and made me realize that I had begun \\"settling\\" in so many areas of my life.<br />I eventually bought the hard cover and am reading that now, going through with my highlighter and pen (yes, I know the Kindle has a highlight and note function...) as I want to be able to thumb through on a regular basis to refresh my brain!<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough! It is easy to read and Hal's plan is easy to follow.
B009CFYRCG|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. I liked the price for the Blu-ray disc and it was quickly delivered to my home. Definitely recommend!!
B001CHXUPC|4.0|Its a good start for someone who likes WW2 aircraft. This is a must have for any one's collection as its the only one I know thats in 1/48th scale.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I associated this song as gospel (meaning God is Next To Me).  Love the CD, & it was delivered timely more sooner than expected & was extremely happy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game.  These little guys (Minions) are so cute.  The game had some problems when I first got it wouldn't load on my Kindle Fire first gen. for the first 3 days.  I was heartbroken!  Then the 4th day it was fixed and so far has been ok since.  I think it is a great game for all ages.  wonderful time passer!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a Must-have! I rely on this Battery to let me know how much juice I have. And it's free....doesn't get better than that!!!
1476704163|5.0|As a long time Ke$ha follower, I was overjoyed when I heard about her book. I refer back to this book so many times, it's insane. It includes so much info people don't know about her and makes you love her so much more.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|This is a must own for all the metal gear fans out there. It has the entire collection and is a great piece itself. Even if I get a ps4 I will never abandon my PS3 and all the metal gear games. I often find myself going back and replaying the entire series.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I saw that a lot of people liked this app, so I download it after a lot of downloads it stooped at 51% and I had to shut my kindle down.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This has been great so far and the word prompts help her know where to go. She is 8 years old and anything horse related is exciting.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|After seeing Despicable Me 2 in the theater, my kids had to see the original. I found it on Amazon for a great price and it also said it had a digital download, although some reviews said the download date has expired. I took my chances, as I love to put digital downloads on my I-tunes account for my kids to watch on the I-pad on road trips and they are hard to come by these days. The item arrived much faster than originally promised and to my delight, the digital download disc easily transferred into my I-tunes account. Newer movies have ultraviolet copies which do not work well with I-tunes. Additionally, upon purchase of this item, we were given a free digital viewing of this movie (24hours) so my kids were able to watch it immediately on our PC instead of waiting for it to come in the mail! Great movie and great service from Amazon!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|was downloading for my daughter but I'm loving this myself. what a great way to kill time. runs excellent on the kindle fire.
1475143389|5.0|This book is a must have because it breaks everthing down. Whether you are new to fitness or experienced this book helps out a great deal. I recommend this book to anyone thats looking to get in shape.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|It took us a while to figure out that some of the story threads came from other movies like Thor. That made it a little more exciting the second time we watched it. Overall, an enjoyable movie with a great assortment of characters. If I had to pick on it a bit, I'd say that the movie itself was too short to really develop any of the characters very well. That, I suppose is what all the other movies are there for.
B00992CF6W|5.0|There are so many different things to do! Build epic castles or huge metropolises in creative. Become a monster slayer or find diamonds in survival! The new update makes it possible to put lava and water anywhere, and spawn eggs can let you create farms without the hassle of trying to herd animals into fences. And to those minecraft fans out there, look up Skydoesminecraft on youtube!
B008M721MS|3.0|I wish I could have just sign on regular skype with all my regular contacts. It is hard finding my contacts and when I do send requests they think its some phoney person.I dont know if I can have my contacts automatically or if I am doing something wrong
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So far I'm really enjoying this game and everything that comes with it. I would highly recommend it to anyone considering it.
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|I grew up watching Willow, it was one of my favorite movies. In the summer, my mom would drop my brother and me along with a couple of our friends off at the cheap theater on the Navy base while she would hit up the commissary and run any other errands she had on her list where we would be bothersome. I always loved when Willow was the featured show.<br />Now, I get an HD version of it right in my own living room and can share the experience with my kids. However, and the only reason I am not giving this five stars, is that I wish the discs had more special features, specifically commentary and making-of video. It contains a couple of deleted scenes I was thrilled to see, but I would have thought a more extensive making-of could have been assembled given the amount of time the movie has been out.<br />Regardless, if you love adventure movies, this is on the must-see list.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman has a knack for capturing the essence of stories and of making fantastic things seem like they happened to someone familiar, or perhaps to you.  In this book, he returns to form, after the creative void he lapsed into after The Graveyard Book, but goes beyond.  This book bears memories of a lifestyle long lost, and of the fears we had as children, and of the hope that these would somehow be different or before of only we had some who understood and believed, and who had the power to change circumstances.<br /><br />At one level, the plot is a fantastic tale of things older than time, of carrion-eaters who cannot be denied their feed, and of a boy who finds a magical friend. At another level, it is a story of wish-fulfilment by a boy who is ignored by his post war, upwardly mobile parents, and the evanescent affair between the abusive, neglected father and the new governess, an affair nipped in the bud by the violent reactions of the boy to the discovery, and the subsequent dismissal of the trollop.<br /><br />It is far more fun though, to revel in the expanded universe revealed to the child and to hope that we might find a way into it someday.<br /><br />There are beautiful sections in the book, which occasionally feels like an early Stephen King, and a hope that it were longer, all the more to the experience the wonders of Hempstock Farm
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Yes, Fun. is on the rise because of Some Nights, Carry On, and We are Young.  Yes, I love those songs too, and could listen to them on repeat.  But don't do that -- instead listen to the whole album on repeat.<br /><br />The lyrics in this album are thought-provoking, the production and varied techniques used in the songs is interesting to listen to, and overall, the whole album flows into a piece that is rightfully award winning.  I cannot wait to see what they do with their next album.  Nate Ruess' vocals and lyrics are spot on, Jack Antonoff and Andrew Dost show their instrumental skill throughout the album.<br /><br />For those of you who are runners, once you become hooked on this album it is THE perfect album to run with.  It has a great tempo for your long runs.
B005KXT58U|5.0|I had gotten burned on evanescence during high school, none of the songs held the magic they once had. Its safe to say that I love every track. Amy Lee has regained the beauty and power in her voice, and there is a real feeling that the lyrics truly mean something to her. The music once again has depth and epic sound.<br />I missed Evanescence.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This app is totally worth the money.<br />Most amazing graphics ever! Better than my wii!<br />It does take up lots of space tho
0385349831|3.0|I really, really liked The Alchemist. It was a fable. It was an easy read with deep meaning. So, I thought I'd really like this book, Manuscript Found in Accra. I was a little disappointed. I suppose if you go into it with an understanding of the context and have an expectation of the format, it's easier to appreciate. Other reviewers have explained that this takes place in 1099, and that the words are of The Copt (a man of worldly, philosophical wisdom). The book is broken down into narrative. A member of the crowd audience will ask a question, and The Copt will answer with flowing, unquantifiable, eternal enlightenment. It's a transformative read, but you have to be in the right state of mind (philosophical, perhaps), and definitely come from a faith-based perspective (which I do). This very well could be your cup of tea--it just wasn't exactly mine.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I wish more content was free or that you  could earn coins and gems more easily but it's a beautiful game for horse lovers!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game needs more levels to keep you busy great game to play to pass time away at the doctors office or anywhere to kill time
B005T87QCI|1.0|I had this game but it was too cheesy and easy it's just like the movie the game u should buy instead world war Z
B005WMADYE|5.0|This movie was out of nowhere!  I didn't know about it until I stumbled upon it in the &#34;recommended&#34; section of Amazon.  Fast paced animation that's got a great color scheme and almost &#34;comic book&#34; feel.  The movie itself is SO LONG, but you'll hardly notice because the plot keeps you glued to the screen.  Very cool.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show!! Love the interaction of the characters and the edgy storyline.  Can't wait to catch up so I can watch the new season.
B001LX2J22|5.0|Red Dragon is the prequel to the more famous Silence of the Lambs, but I prefer it due to better characters.  Edward Norton as Will Graham is amazing.  Ralph Fiennes as the serial killer?  Whoa.  They do a really good job giving the killer a back story, all while keeping Hannibal Lecter involved in the plot.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Having seen the first season of Dexter, the story was well known. The ending was a bit confusing. Looking to read the next one.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I have to watch this movie on subtitles due to Batman + Bane sounding like a scoop of gravel in the dryer.
0761172726|3.0|I have used this calendar for years and it is great for categorizing appointments by individual. This year the calendar came slightly damaged; a very deep crease all the way through the right side of the calendar. Not worth my time to return.
B00BOXZAG6|4.0|THE 3D DOES NOT WORK; WATCHED IN REGULAR 2D AND MOVIE WAS INTERESTING.  DOES NOT HAVE SEPARATE DISKS FOR BLU-RAY AND 3D, MAYBE THAT IS THE PROBLEM.  SINCE I BOUGHT USED, THE PRICE WASN'T REAL HIGH, THUS THE 4 STAR RATING.
B0084HJE0S|1.0|I know that there are free Kindle eBooks out there, and I thought this was one of them.  Sorely disappointed...what IS this?  Somebody else compared it to a high school essay on technology, and I agree.  Not sure why this is out here...there's something in there about an \\"upgraded\\" version from O'Reilly for $4.99, but I'm not sure what that even is and don't want to risk downloading whatever it is...is it something like this?  Or the rest of the book.  Is this a new marketing technique?  CONFUSED.<br /><br />Kind of a waste of time.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The book is well written.  It takes place in the Middle East where I lived for many years so of particular interest to me.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|ot is good but really confusing so don't get the app Ps if you are a pro at the game still don't get it
B005544V6A|5.0|Found it on Amazon and tried it out because it conflict with another show I watch on &#34;live&#34; tv.  Love it!  Very fun
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I think this is the most well thought out film in the X Men franchise. Great character development. Awesome movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|only wished they had more than ten levels. the paid version also has only ten levels but ad free. developers please add more levels.
6305972591|5.0|Item arrived in a timely matter and packaged brand new as expected! I watched this oldie a long time ago so now looking forward to seeing it again with my daughter.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|All of the other bags I came across were too bulky. I do most of my work on the beach and didn't want a huge bag to lug around.  Perfect size, padded well, everything fits....good to go!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I love the story of Steve Jobs and it was incredible to see how Steve built Apple to where it is today. This book is written very well and has became one of my favorite books.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|really enjoyed game... continues to expand and evolve... pun intended. pretty dinosaurs.  I like ponies why does this have a word number minimum? get this app
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game. It is like subway suffers but even better. It is also challenging. At first it is hard then when you get use to it, it becomes easier. I really like this game alot.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Worth the money & then some classic never gets old no skips at all...Every song is in sequence can relate to his storytelling
B00A6C3JN2|5.0|The Due is the source of great summer projects about for my high school son!  Nice documentation available online and the I/O ports are plentiful and varied.
B0000AUHPG|1.0|The disk is skipping. We watrched only a short part and couldn't watch anymore. Couldn' understand what they were saying.
0061906220|5.0|I have several children in my family of all ages and every one loves this book.  Each one sings it all day long.
1623420148|1.0|This book looked like trash, but because it had about 8 zillion great reviews here, I thought I'd give it a try. You know what they say, \\"Never judge a book by it's cover.\\" So, despite my typical literary snobbery and inner voice screaming \\"Don't fall for the reviews! This book is going to blow! Look at the cover! Judge this book by its cover!\\", I bought it. Annnnndddd my cover judgement proved correct: I couldn't even get past the second chapter. The book was terrible. How so?<br /><br />1. The plot was totally unoriginal and uninspired. I felt this way when I bought the book, but I went for it anyway. It didn't work out.<br />2. The author was trying too hard to be a man. Tangled totally reads like it's written by a woman who is trying to think like a really slick, egotistical man, not an actual slick, egotistical man. While the latter could be insightful, or at least entertaining, the former is painful and lame.<br />3. Everything felt really forced. The writing and dialogue weren't natural, smooth, or clever at all. The writing wasn't funny. It wasn't interesting. It was excruciating. I just couldn't do it.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever returned a book in my life, but I would absolutely return this one if my return window wasn't closed.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I liked the app until it kept updating and downloading even when I wasn't using it or pulling it up on my own. It kept showing a new download in the top left corner of my kindle fire so I would check what downloaded and it was this app. So annoying! I only want an app to download info when I want it to.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This was amazing and was a great gift. The show is always amazing and whenever I am feeling down, it helps to cheer me up.
0060899190|2.0|Thought it would be sweet and touching, but instead it was dark, discouraging, and depressing.  Too many unhappy thoughts exposed.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|It is great! I had heard so much about this show and was happy to finally see it. I do prefer the books to the show however, it is still great.
0694003611|5.0|This is a book that was a bedtime favorite of my young children.  The restful, quiet routine of saying &#34;good night&#34; to everything in the room, puts children into a happy, sleepy frame of mind.
B007URVZJ6|2.0|Too general; leaves much to be known before one steps off into the world of EBooks. Suggest books on writing be considered. Regarding research, this leaves one with the impression that a little effort is sufficient. The responsibility for research lies with the author of any article, book, or EBook. Others may depend on the information; thus the author must extend beyond simple methods, working to understand the subject matter sufficient to appear in public speaking on the subject; including taking questions.
0307200477|5.0|Since my babies loved this little book, it was what I ordered for the new baby of a young mother who wanted books for her baby.  Babies and toddlers love the repetition of touching the different surfaces (fuzzy, scratchy, reflective) as the pages are turned and the story is read to them.
0205313426|2.0|Good when written; seriously out of date today. Basics are mostly known via normal English classes. Once reviewed, it now sits on the shelf.
B000SW4DLM|5.0|Great plot. Harrison Ford at his dowdy best. Rutger Hauer at his moody and simmering best. If you like rainy, dystopian futures you will like this.
0425263924|5.0|Best book!! Scary to think the bad reviews almost a steered me away. Now I can't believe there were any bad reviews and especially can't believe people are upset about another book in the sequel.  Thank God there is!!!..My favorite series.  Thank you Sylvia Day for keeping it going!!  Great job with all the characters and as always. Love your writing!!
B00CDUVDEC|2.0|Been waiting to hear this for a long time and as much as I want to like this I have to admit it's just not very good. No structure or groove in any of the songs. Just seems like a bunch of riffs thrown together with no rhyme or reason, and not very good ones at that. Absolutely nothing to latch onto here. It's a shame as I am a huge fan of Pantera, Down, and Superjoint Ritual. I guess I kind of get what he was trying here but it just didn't work out, nothing about this album works really. I hate putting down a Phil album as I love most of his bands and albums but this really is horrible. And only 8 songs for just over a half hour of music. Some may enjoy it but personally I'm sticking with Down or SJR if they ever get back together.
B003KRGCTI|5.0|Had to watch this for an university course.  Enjoyed it very much, but LOVED that I could download it onto my iPad for viewing on the airplane!
B00992CF6W|5.0|update it to the computer<br />but other than that its a great apples  i should be able to go to the underworld
B009A9SULS|4.0|This is a great little reader if you can find it on sale. I managed to pick one up for the $39 July special.  Maybe I am cheap but $90 is overpriced.  It is very small -- I have seen phones bigger than this thing. But it does make a nice add on to my regular reader. It is my just in case, take it anywhere, battery won't die afer a couple of hours, hide it in my pocket reader.  A mini stylus from the local store helps too. For it's size it has some nice features many of the same ones as a regular sized black/white reader, and it has a few gripes. Like when you buy a book you have to start all over if you want another one. On the plus side it has antiglare and adjustable text size for sneaking out of a cold office for some sunshine and a quick read. If you don't have a shirt pocket it fits in a small make up case, for those little side trips. I gave it 4 stars because of the minor quirks and price. But if you can find it at a reasonable price you will love its portability.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This and the noaa site are the best for accurate reports... for international reports... this one rocks... just wish it showed the current time. ... not the time since it's last update. ..good app to have. .
B000FC1HBY|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said...this, much like the first book is a great read! I could barely put it down! If you're thinking about buying it, BUY IT you will not regret it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is an awesome game and I absolutely love it. very addicting and fun for all ages. I recommend this game for everyone.
B001QK91TY|5.0|A great \\"must see\\" for music lovers!  It's a classic!!  1058 Newport Jazz Fest. Movie made in 1959.  By one out greatest artist; same as the person who did all the great Marilyn  Monroe's photographs.
0062255657|5.0|This is a great story. It is subtle, nuanced, and thought provoking, as well as straight-forward and exciting. I love Gaiman's efficiency with his words in this book.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|This game is absolutley amazing! Well worth the 7 Dollars. Others may say it sucks but it doesn't. Have Fun!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This Man of Steel is the best Super Man movie since Super Man 2. True the humor, and the lightheartedness of the original Donner and Reeves movies are missing, but for any fan of Superman (of the comics), you will be pleased to see the nod thsi movie gives to the newer stories of Superman portrayed in the comics. I admit,t he first time I saw the film, I still had Christopher Reeves en-grained in my head, but the second time I was able to give Man of Steel it's due respect in being it's own film and not trying to take anything away from the original Superman movies. I appreciated Michael Shannon not trying to emulate the original General Zod, but making Zod his own and more similar to the comics, a general who makes the reader/viewer not sure whether to root for him or against. The casting was unbelievable and as much as people seem to give a hard time to the development being solely on Superman, it makes sense as a franchise starting film. Expect to see a lot more character development of Lois and the other main characters such as Perry White in the second film. Overall, great movie, great experience! Best summer movie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really fun game! My children love it! The minions are so cute! I haven't gotten far but my oldest has and all the different scenes look great.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|This hurt. Les Mis was one of my favorite stage musicals. The score is incredible. The one thing missing from any stage production is the sweeping visual effects that only a movie can provide. Only so much can be created on stage. Thus, I looked forward to this movie with great anticipation -- scenes I imagined from the book could be created in grand Hollywood style. And they are.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the score is downright painful. The great range of the Broadway cast is replaced by actors doing their best, but they don't get it done. The addition of painful cockney British accents for the galleries, presumably intended to help the movie represent the gritty, impoverished streets of France, hurt my ears. The gallery belonged in My Fair Lady, not Les Mis. I can't understand why everyone has to sound English in a movie set in France. All the men seem to be sopranos too. Ouch.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Probably the best purchase this last year. I don't know if it's possible to wear out a Blu-ray but my boys are determined to try it.
193700788X|5.0|Ms. Charlaine, you have done a superb job. Sookie has shown strength, growth, love, and loyalty throughout this book. I was very pleased that she has matured into the women I knew she could be. Wonderful job!
B00902UH5M|5.0|I didn't expect to find this book as interesting as it turned out to be. I actually found it hard to put down -- Arnold speaks in plain language about his life and I found it unputdownable. The extra audio and video features in this Kindle edition also makes it worth the money
B00275EHJG|3.0|the movie is great and my 2.5 year old loves it but it arrived and the case was broken and when i opened it the inside was in pieces as well, luckily the movie played fine but i was not happy that the case arrived broken and now i dont have a case to put it in, we have a DVD player in our car and thats why we bought this movie and now we dont have a case for it
B000U0O9FM|5.0|a must read for fans of the film and/or palahniuk. hilarious, dark, truthful, biting, scarring, enlightening, witty, enveloping, beautiful work
B00CFITJKW|2.0|This game is not worth 5.00$ it has the worst graphics ive ever seen in my hole time playing a kindle fire I do not recemend no one to buy this rip off of the other thing I don't like about this game is u cant even move the plane by moving the kindle u have to move the plane with ur fingers what a rip off.
159102594X|4.0|While it does not contain the scope of characters and settings that Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" or Erikson's \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen,\\" its focus on just a few might be more pleasing to some readers. All the characters are great in that they are interesting, have faults and contain strengths and weaknesses. The setting is unique and the dialog and story are a pleasure to read. This is only the first book in the series, but it is promising to become memorable.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a fast going game. If you are read for a fast game then go with Temple Run 2. The one thing I don't like is sometimes it does not read your movement. But I have to say it is a awesome game to play with your kids or by yourself.
B001DF68MA|5.0|When I saw this, I thought : that'd be fun. Man o Man, My son has an absolute blast and wants to go on rides all the time. It is comfy for him too for those longer rides. He goes and grabs his helmet to let me know he wants to go. The construction of this thing is good. Although I had to add some screws to keep the foot rests from hitting the shocks while turning, I attribute that to the type of mountain bike i mounted this to. The mounting is easy, solid and reliable. If you're thinking about buying this seat DO IT! you'll be glad you did. Please be safe and remember the precious cargo at all times. Peace to all.
B004EPZ034|5.0|My kids have watched this video almost every day, excellent video for my 3 boys ages 3,4, and 5.keeps their attention
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Also bought this as a gift. Another instant classic for Christian Bale and company. Really great direction for DC to go in.
B001NKI60W|5.0|It was a wonderful movie, we watch it at least a couple times a year, mainly at scrap retreats.  Music is great!!
B00005JNJV|5.0|Bought as a gift, great movie. It's so cheap these days too. The start of a fantastic series of films.
B003FC6WBQ|5.0|It's a classic! Who doesn't love to watch a story with Carey Grant and Jimmy Stewart? Makes you think about marriage!
B007PF7MGS|4.0|Love this book. The science and common sense that underlie the McDougall program are incontrovertible. I've done my best to adopt this eating plan with impressive results: BP way down, Cholesterol below 160 and weight loss. Although I did expect more weight loss, I'll keep at it since it is working. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is there is an assumption that you stop eating when you get full.  That isn't always true and I'd like to see a later edition address the psychological reason for overeating and how to overcome compulsive cravings.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is so awesome it is so fun to play except I wish you didn't have to wait for things to hatch and grow
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game, passed all 10 levels in about 2 hours, wish it had more levels, I could play all day!!!!
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|The album is correctly named! Bob Marley's music was and is legendary! This completes my collection of his work. Fabulous!
B002APS61I|4.0|I love the story of Pride and Prejudice, and I really enjoyed this version.  The acting, scenery, costumes, etc. are superb.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I only give a five-star rating for a movie that I feel is &#34;profound&#34; in some way, e.g,, Schindler's List.  This version was also a bit longer than the one I've seen on TV, which was fun too.  You won't be disappointed if you rent this movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very fun and exciting app. You can build buildings, parks, and sport stadiums. Create your own city however you want.enjoy
B003ODL3V0|4.0|State of euphoria is a thrash classic  and this doble yellow vinyl has a nice gatefold presentation, however, it doesnt include bonus tracks songs, this edition contains only the original songs featured on the album
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So freaking addicted to this game I love it so much I might die make new levels NOW ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game.. The Minions are sooo cute.. Nice and challenging game.. I love the background music and Agnes's song ^_^
B002N57KG2|4.0|this is a reel funny movie a lot of different and good comedians in it.<br />kind of on the same line as the smokie and the bandit movies
0823023494|5.0|this book is great for people interested in character design showing you the basic steps required to work in the industry i gave it a 5 out of 5 only because thats as high as it gos.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|I love this book. I've bought it four times. But when I love a book I tend to give it away to a friend because I want to share it so much.<br /><br />This time I got a little smarter. E-book! I'm far less likely to give away my tablet. Lol!<br />And it took a while for this book to come out in e-book. I'd been searching for it for over a year and it finally came out. In the mean time, I bought it and gave it away again. Haha.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was completely taken aback. What I thought I knew, was not at all the turn the storyline took. Can't wait to find out what is next.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a super fun app. It's great for all ages. I gladly recommend this game to anyone. I love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's very fun and interesting game, I really like it, thank you, guys, for this free app, it's like a present! :)
B002VPE1AW|5.0|What ever they payed the special effects team(s) it wasn't enough. The story line was kinda thin, but it was a lot of fun to watch. It reminded me of &#34;Zulu&#34; but this time the natives win.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Just awesome, the best game I have played on my kindle since I got it!  It has great graphics and awesome weapons to choose from the shop and I've only played the game for about 5 hours or so.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have used the app for quite a few months now with no problems or issues.  The fact that it was free is also a plus.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This novel started out well, but the characters had no redeeming qualities as the story progressed.  The resolution was hard to take.  I found it to be a waste of time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is brilliant and stunning game and I hope to see more of this as I see more of this amazing preformance as the game proceeds
B0045TYDNC|5.0|On certain lenses the older caps can get finicky about how you line them up.<br />These just pop onto any lens, any brand, in a snap and fit perfect.<br />I have been slowly replacing all my older problem caps with these by adding them on to my amazon orders.<br />Best rear cap I've seen.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very entertaining and the visual animation is beautiful. Looks and moves just as a real horse would. This game really surprised me and I recommend it to all horse fans. All in all, this game is outstanding!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It is a very controversial subject done with a variation of emotions.....anger, humor, compassion, love. Totally enjoyed the development of the story as well as the growth of the characters.  First book that got me thinking about helplessness of this magnitude.  Thought at first hero was too self-centered; wound up feeling otherwise.  A good read, well-written and thought-provoking.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I started watching Walking Dead the third season.  Being able to catch up with Seasons 1 and 2 with Amazon instant videos was perfect for me.  No DVDs to store since I knew I was only going to be watching them one time.  Watching on my Ipad worked great for me,  too.  What a wonderful way to watch movies and TV Shows!  Thanks,  Amazon!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|If you are a Black Sabbath fan, a true old school Sabbath fan you will enjoy this album.  If you're looking for Sabbath from the Dio time frame, which is a faster paced, pumped up, head banging sound you won't find it here.  What you will find are some deep lyrics... the kind of lyrics that will make you think about what Ozzy is saying as well as some classic metal, beautifully crafted guitar pieces and a well-produced sound for an excellent cranked up headphone listening experience.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is the type of movie you can watch with the spouse, as well as the parents, and everyone is entertained. Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it!!!! it is the cutest and funniest game EVER! My kids had a kick out of this game.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This movie tells the story of Lincoln from an angle few will have been exposed to before. Well worth the rental; excellent acting. Of course, we all know how the story ends but it's still a great flick.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great book.  Kept my interest completely and knew the next book would be great.  Someone I saw reading this book recommended it to me.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Installed adobe and it just doesn't work ... things that require it still don't load. Cool.  Considered uninstalling it but I'm over it  not worth the download ..
B004UPANGM|5.0|Sure that for our current standards visual effect and plot are not the top notch but if viewed under the optic of 70-80's it is a great great movie like I said a must watch
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this series!  Julianna Margales is a superb actress along with the rest of the cast.  I find myself getting lost in the story.  There are also excellent supporting actors and actresses that make this show &#34;one to watch&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It could be great but wouldn't know since it wont load. Hangs and locks the kindle. Fix that bug and we might  have a really good app.
B0053O89YM|5.0|This TV show just continues to get better and better. I hope this writing continues!!! I think I would rather have Will and Alicia together and not her husband!!!
B005ZUR724|5.0|very fun and addicting and mmo if you a fan of world of warcraft and rift this is a great game pick just amazon is bad at keeping up with this game compared to android market
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|never could get the movie to load on my roku<br />even tho I tried many times/ways<br />I was still charged the rental fee??!!<br /><br />Amazon has made it difficult to reach appropriate dept for help
B008D28HYS|5.0|I like the color addition.  I have the black and one Cross Me but this one brings more enjoyment to the projects.
B00CFA222M|5.0|I WATCHED THIS MOVIE WHILE ON VACATION A FEW MONTHS AGO AND ENJOYED IT&#62;  I BOUGHT THE DVD FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN AND THEY ALSO ENJOYED IT&#62;  GREAT FAMILY MOVIE&#62;
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Much easier to use and get out of then the 247 Mahjong I downloaded earlier this year.  Many different formats and touchscreen is very receptive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is the best app ever. It is so nice on the kindle fire it's such a big screen u have more room to look around
B0059WTMLW|4.0|It seems to be very easy to use and I like it that you don't have to do it on a timed basis.
B00198X0WW|5.0|Powerful, moving, a pure experience to watch! The acting was superb! The story gripping. The cinematography stunning. It is one of my very favorites. The dilemma that politics plays in religion, especially the interplay between the Catholic Jesuit order and the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal is also touched upon in a realistic and accurate way. The tragedy of the encounter between Europe and the New World is also examined in this film. Robert De Niro is superb! The role of true and active repentance in the process of forgiveness is also highlighted in this sensitive work. This is a very Catholic movie and I loved it! It doesn't sugar coat, it remain very honest and is actually profound.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|And I am very interested how the movie is similiar to the book. I tend to read the book if feelings of Depression creeps up.
B000T7FO6E|5.0|This is a great album of Ringo material live! I particularly like this one because it is all Ringo and not another All Star Band live album. I love Ringo and his music and it is great to hear a full set of Ringo songs. All the classics are here, Photograph, Don't Pass Me By, With a little help from my Friends,  If you are a fan of Ringo and his music I would highly recommend this one. This one and live one from VH1 rank as my two favorite Ringo live CD's and considering how many live albums there are that is saying a lot! Grab it now and rock out with Ringo.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie is a real tear jerker. Have a box or 2 tissues when whatching this movie. I have watched it about 10 times and cry every time.
006178480X|5.0|My #1 favorite author and here is another example of why!  The story line draws you in, characters are old and new - I love so many of the old ones and they are like old friends by now.  I love the descriptiveness of the stories.... the details and data that goes into each one.  They are compelling in so many ways that I find it hard to put the books down and as soon as I am done I am disappointed that I don't have another new one to pick up.  It's hard to find another author that I like as much or who writes with as much action/adventure/touch of romance that I enjoy.  I wish he had a new book coming out every month!  :-)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written, not totally predictable.  Kept my attention from beginning to end.  Great Novel.  I will check out more from this author.
0525478817|5.0|The Falut in our Stars is one of those books that leave you in a daze. Enthralling. After reading this book you are left beyond Okay
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love this app. It is fun, challenging, and full of twists and turns. It is a little short so please keep the levels comin
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|Brothers & Sisters the Brothers 5th album here in a fabulus rendition, with a large fold out cover, 4 Cds where the first is the origibal Cd remastered, sounds great except for the cymbals sounding a bit distorted, great music and then CD2 outtakes and studie run throughs a great way to hear old songs with this rendition of the band, but best is the CDs 3 and 4 with the full Concert at Winterland September 26 1973, great band and sound, of course not like with Duane but great in there own way!!
B00C1BU8G2|4.0|It's good and my son enjoyed watching it. Special effects could have been made much better though !! I think Jurassic Park 1 was much better in terms of the special effect It had
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|What an interesting idea and then given the monster twist some of the lines were predictable but the bipolar Dracula coming to grips with his 118 year old teenage daughter dating.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I was disappointed with the ending. It wasn't really explained what the girl and her family were. A let down.
B004A3DRCQ|4.0|It's Jarre. Like it or leave it. A lot of his work is a masterpiece, especially when associated with a laser show.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Placed in Gibraltar and England, an understated British tale of illegal undercover activity. Fun to read with an abrupt surprising ending
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|This book was interesting. I would recommend this book to other 6th grade  students. It was very easy to follow and understand. I didn't think that I would like but it was actually very good.
B000FA675C|5.0|I couldn't put the book down until the end. It starts off relatively slowly as a crime novel but the action picks up after a number of pages and turns into a chase where you don't know what will happen at each turn.
159463176X|5.0|A story rich in history.  Beautifully constructed with believable, three-dimensional characters. Events and characters portrayed in technicolor.  A page turner.  Read it and learn about the triumph of the human spirit over poverty and war, tragedy and prejudice.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|A beautiful movie that tugs at your heart and shows you a depth of friendship that is uncommon.  I recommend watching it.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Actually saw this first on a plane flight but couldn't wait to see it in real/uninterrupted view. Of course with Amazon I saw it right away. Prepare to be surprised.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Great musician, music and sound. like his other work it,s unique and a one of a kind sound. Arrived promptly and packaged well. price good.
0440217563|5.0|Once you get into this book you cant stop! It is a series and you HAVE to know what happens, so you'll get the next and the next...i actually bought 2 sets of the first 4 books to give as gifts. I read them as ea came out. I loved them (OBVIOUSLY)!!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I gave it a 3 star as I felt it wasn't as good as the first instalment - wasn't written as well...
B0089LOG02|3.0|I would classify this book as young adult. I enjoyed the book but feel its definitely written more on a YA level. Very nice job of weaving the past and present stories together.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|The Clifton Chronicles hold your attention. The characters seemed real and I was compelled to keep reading. Couldn't stop with one book.
B000FVE3AC|4.0|I'm 6'1\\" 200lbs and the watch fits great but the winder does dig into my wrist after wearing it a while and the watch is extremely heavy compared to the Invicta Titanium 0420 I own.  I've owned this for a couple of months and have only worn it a couple of times because of this.  Watch is strikingly beautiful and has a bluish/purplish hue to it.  Recently took it on a cruise and used in the beach with the kids on slides, etc.  with no problems so watch is extremely waterproof as advertised.<br /><br />Don't buy this unless you have the wrist to wear it or you will suffer the repercussions.  Same watch in black is $700 (don't understand why) but this watch does have good looks and is on the cheap at just over $100.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was disappointed by the number of characters lost in this season, but the story line was awesome! The Dowager Countess is always a great comic relief, and the introduction to the other grandmother made things interesting.  I also loved the transition into the 20's with jazz music and flapper outfits.
B0063IH60K|3.0|it's addicting and I can't stop playing it,  I dream about it and can't put it down.  Buy this game you will love it.  Jane
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|Still might be my favorite HP movie- looks great on Blu ray, but no more special features than the regular DVD.
B007STXHTM|3.0|Did they really have to make the flat lens cover 1/3 of the display?  Sometimes I'm not sure what setting the camera is on.  I've used it about 6 times in the water and it flooded once knocking my camera out for about 3 days while it dried.  Apparently the latch was not set fully or something caught on it.  Hope all is well, cause it's gonna get wet today.
B000VDDDY6|3.0|The discs come with only minimal labelling as fine print that I need magnifying glass to see. In other words you can't see what disc number or what series you are looking at. The housing for the discs looks very flimsy
B008XKSW7M|1.0|I keep forgetting I've tried to watch this before and keep trying to watch it again.  The casting pulls me in and the opening makes me turn it off.  I don't think I've ever made it more than 15 or 20 minutes into the movie.  Needless to say, I've given it ample opportunity to draw me in.  It just does not have that drawing power.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Really funny and a perfect movie for the boys night out.  Marky Mark is funny as hell and Ted is just LOL hilarious.
B003MS0UHU|5.0|I would recommended this movie to anyone. It was very entertaining and I would watch it again. Its a great family movie!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game is kind of hard and in order to keep playing you need to be able to revive yourself with tokens.  It is so easy to lose that you keep running out of tokens and then you are constantly asked to buy more.  Then when you buy more tokens, you run out of those.  Not a game for me.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was disappointed with this novel.  I anticipated it and started reading it the day it was released.  It started out with a heart-touching story, but went downhill from there.  I found it difficult to keep track of the characters.  The stories jumped from place to place and weren't well connected.  It took me a few pages in each new section to figure out what was going on, and how it was connected to the previous stories.  I kept reading and hoping that I would get an experience like The Kite Runner, but the end was just another let down.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Very much.  Easy to pick up and put down.  Relaxing puzzle game.  Beautiful graphics, too.  Look forward to the sequel.
B005LAII8K|5.0|It will keep your attention throughout the duration of the movie.  Husband and I originally saw this movie in the theater.  When we really like what we've seen, we will purchase the blu-ray.  This one made the list!
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Boring from start to finish.  A quick read but once you have finished, you won't remember anything noteworthy.  I feel like I know less about Tina Fey now than before I read this book.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I really love this CD it makes me feel real good...I loves the way Bruno sings...I like his voice really nice.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Its mentally stimulating and can keep you entertained for hours. I highly recommend this game for those who like brain teasers
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever! I love building with blocks. It's just so addicting. It's awesome! Be sure to check out survivalcraft!
B00BYISQTO|5.0|I had never heard anything from The National before purchasing this album. I live in the radio wasteland that is New York City. Every electronic service I have was suggesting this release (due to prior purchases of The Magnetic Fields? Beirut? Tame Impala? ...not sure). This is a stellar collection of songs. Demons and Slipped are beautifully arranged. Treat yourself and get this album - you will find yourself playing it over and over again.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a great game. I am glad they made it. I love it. I love hill climb racing. Go dogs.
0062059963|2.0|My book is missing pages 266-299............ how in Heaven's name does this happen?!?!  I am desperate to find out what happened in those pages!
0307744434|5.0|The simplest way I can describe the Night Circus, which is not a simple book at all, is that it is written beautifully and has one of the most well though out plots I have ever read. However, you need to be slow and really appreciate it, if you are expecting fireworks and nonstop action, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />There is a deadly game afoot set in place by two men that are much older than they seem. A game, a contest, a dual; a competition between two magicians that will have consequences for not only them, but for everyone else that gets involved.<br /><br />The concept of a magician's dual, especially created in such a devious and mysterious way was fascinating and left just enough secrecy for the reader to wonder along with the main characters.<br /><br />Celia and Marco were fantastic characters. Actually, the whole cast of characters was magnificent, each of them having their own motives and flaws and secrets. They, like the entire book, were each puzzles, and even by the end of the book there are still missing pieces, but that is the beauty of THE NIGHT CIRCUS.<br /><br />For a story written in third person, and at times second person, it is so wonderfully written. You can taste, hear, smell, and see everything that is described in vivid detail, and it is so amazing. I had to give the writing five stars, it was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />The romance is not the main component of this book, so do not go in expecting it from the start. It develops slowly, over time, and that makes all the difference to the story. It just adds more emotion in the end and lets you focus on other important parts in the book.<br /><br />If you have not read this book now, I suggest you do so as soon as possible. But make sure you have the time to truly savor it.<br /><br />(Originally posted on readerswonderland.com)
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|I wish Firefly had gone more than 1 season. This is a fun series, but Firefly had so much more depth of character.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I bought this for my son as a gift, he loves it.He is a History major in college and he said it was one of the best movies he's seen in a long time.
1936608898|5.0|Great information!  Very useful and helpful in changing the way I think about food and eating!  Saw an amazing change in body composition.  You truly feel so much better when you eat clean!
B004SDEP38|5.0|Is very very useful. Is a app awsome aaaaaaaaa. Is good la good is good aaaáaaaaaajdkkfkendnkeld xndkldkfjkf great great great great grrat
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I bought this film for the same reasons many people bought it &#34;love of fantastical comic heroes from my childhood.&#34; We all saw the intro to the main characters in their solo movies although it would have been great to see a movie about Black Widow and Hawkeye, both had dark pasts and eventually overcame them. This film was well put together and other than waiting till the very end of the credits to see a glimpse of what is to come, that could have been worked into the ending.<br /><br />Like everyone else its all a matter of personal opinion. But if you enjoyed Capt America, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and Thor then you will enjoy this movie. It has a lot of quirks from each character that can be found in the comic books while adding the dimension of watching the characters grow and face challenges individually and coming together as a team.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|It's so hard to pass that stage!<br /> Make the armor pencil free please  it's alright tho<br />4stars^_^<br /><br />And it needs an update
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|This movie was wholesome, funny, and enjoyable.  Even though one scene had digital pixelation for a couple seconds, the rest of the movie played well.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I have been a fan of this show since the first episode.  Well written, acted and produced.  If you haven't seen The Walking Dead; you are missing out on great television.  This is right up there with Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under or The Sopranos; just a lot more fun!  I bought this disk as a gift for my sister because I kept telling her to watch it; not sure if she started but I know she will love it when she does.
B0092SQ5EG|2.0|I didn't mean to brush my finger on it and I don't know how to reverse it. So my vote doesn't count.
B00DGNO3WE|1.0|video continually froze up. I eventually gave up, and shut it off! This is not the 1st time I've had this problem.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|This was one of the best movie soundtracks that I have heard in a long time! It was not over done but went with each scene from the movie. It is powerful and dramatic and makes you feel every emotion from the all the scenes. Hans Zimmer once again made magic with this soundtrack and I hope to see him score the sequel's as well.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved this book a few years ago when it came out and so was nervous to see the movie as often the film can destroy the novel.  I was very surprised to find that Ang has done a wonderful job translating this!  I know that Richard Parker is CGI sometimes but couldn't tell when they were.  All in all, this was a wonderful movie!
B004SDSSFY|4.0|As advertised, works better than any other app. Only used it once but just what I needed. Would recommend to anyone.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I enjoy Tony Bennett and all his associates who made this CD possible. His music is relaxing and my era enjoys his wonderful<br />charming personality.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|it Is like most of these games coping other games such as subway surfers<br /><br /> and temple run in all its not bad but It loads a lot and if you like this game I would recommend subway surfers
0151003084|5.0|Classic Gorey! Very entertaining book of the horrible mishaps of school children's day out. Macabre to be sure, but made me laugh and the grand daughters loved it!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is an amazing book from the first page I love it its so detailed I wonder Cassandra Clare gets her ideas
B002TLSSXO|5.0|They keep the counter cleaner (there are drips to contend with, depending on what your cooking). They will MELT if you leave them on the edge of the pot... I love the 2 different sized spatula's. And the spoons are perfect size for cooking.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I got this app as soon as I got a Facebook. It works perfectly! I can communicate with my deployed father on Facebook, and interact with long distance relatives. I love the Facebook app! And it's free!? How can you pass that up?
B003INBOEC|5.0|My husband looks this movie and watch it often. This was a great addition to our movie collection. Keep them coming. This is definitely a recommend for those who love action and martial arts.
B000001EIA|5.0|About the purchase, excellent price, delivery time, and the conditions of the product. This CD from my point of view is the best of unplugged events that I've ever seen, of course, KISS is the best, for those who like good hard rock in acoustic version it's amazing. Check the site to find more KISS records.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book is an easy read and flows beautifully.  You become a part of all the lives, and can't help but feel the pain, betrayal and happiness.  A tear jerker!
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I had originally planned on seeing The Hobbit in theaters being a huge Lord of the Rings fan but I was turned off by the previews that appeared to be overly CGI'd. I ended up giving it a chance and I'm glad that I did. While the characters development does not evoke the same emotions as a Legolas, Gimli, or Aragon they are entertaining to watch. The CGI I got over and there were some really stunning graphics. I will have to catch part II in theaters.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|this game is interesting. each level is a new set of challenges. Half way through and I still cant figure out the mystery. Quite intriguing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subwwat surf is entertaining  and really fun to play. I never get bored of it because of the new places it has automatically. My favorites are Japan and Sydney. I love unlocking the new characters,too.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This is Mario to a T.  Same setup and everything.  Instead of firepower you shoot acorns.  Instead of a mushroom to get big you use a shamrock.  If you like Mario you will like this one.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love it! A great way to relax after a long work day. Instead of a beer play uno watch the weight shed in the mid section
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game is exactly like Mario.  Everything was just tweaked a bit to make it Leprechaun like.  Though if you like Mario you will like this.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|This is not LeCarre's best book. It is still better than 95% of the books out there, and a great read by a master storyteller who can turn a phrase like nobody's business.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a lot of fun.  Some of the puzzles were too easy though others were pretty difficulty.  I just wish there were more levels.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I thought this was going to be one of those normal chick flicks, but it was very good. Romance with some action fight scenes.
B006885EFE|5.0|We purchased this as a download to our iPad and it proved a valuable purchase since viewing it on the plane during a long flight overseas was easy and the quality is of course excellent.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Highly recommend! If you like turn of the century English dramas you will love this series. Maggie Smith is a scream.....
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|I was surprised that this movie was good. Mark Wahlberg is usually good in his movies and this one didn't disappoint.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good challenge. Not sure I like that I have to rate it to keep playing, but small price to pay
B00932A4XE|4.0|This movie is obviously for women, and my wife got me to watch it with her. It was not bad and actually paints a pretty good picture of the ups and downs of pregnancy. The dad parts hold true as well.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The movie perfectly balanced fanboy service with enough action and humor to engage casual fans. The battle at the end was enormous and flashy but not obnoxious.  The actors were great and the movie has high rewatchability.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love this series and I really liked the whole season but I can't give a 5th star because I don't know what happend to Mathew.  I really like that couple and his input into the changes in the Abbey.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I purchased this for a family friend who just saw the Lion King musical and had never seen the movie. She was not familar with the story but after viewing the movie she understood it better. She enjoyed it.
B0076R6MES|4.0|As usual, Rowan Atkinson has proven to reinvent his character, Johnny English, in this slapstick spy parody of wild proportions!  My teenaged children were riveted from the beginning, and were not disappointed with the action and comedy routines.  However, one scene caused me to fast-forward, since it involved a woman who enticed Johnny to come up to watch the striptease. (She ended up scantily clad.) This movie should have been rated PG-13; that was the reason for the four stars, instead of five.  But it is typical of Rowan Atkinson to include some type of perceived romance and innuendo, so some content is not suitable for the youngest of children.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|both my daughters cannot get enough of this movie. Probably watched is a dozen times or more. I have yet to watch it in its entirety but the snippets I've caught seem comical. Well worth the $$$......
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Unable to connect to Facebook,do uninstalled it and will restart it. Deleted from cloud also. Hoping this will work on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Saw in the theatres but had to get my own copy. very sureal movie. Plan to add seal team 6 to my collection also.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Not for me.  None of my friends play.  Doesn't keep me entertained.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone to play
B009AMANBA|5.0|A brilliant spotlight into a very short but inspiring period in US history. Acting superb. I thought I knew alot about Mr Lincoln, but found lots of new excitement in this film.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|lee poo I love my mom she makes cookies she cool I like the lofty it fun love your bud Macy looks
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works great and very handy. Works well over WiFi and data. Use it all the time, nothing bad to say about it.
B004ZJZQJC|5.0|This movie is one of the best 80s movies. And the digital copy still works still even after the expiration date. Highly recomend anyone that bought this to register their digital Ultraviolet copy
B008AK8FHM|5.0|worthwhile to read.  A blessing to read he accepted and believes in God and in Jesus Christ who shed his blood for him.. The Dr. has a story to tell and I am thankful he did just that.
B008220BP2|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Finally a zombie romance.  LOL  Okay lots of blood and gore, but a good story line, acting was good, ending was good.  I do like &#34;Shawn of the Dead&#34; have only seen it 4 or 5 times.  &#34;Day of the Living Dead&#34; was Ok.  Loved Zombieland, so maybe that will help you decide if you want  to see the movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app.  It makes you to think and observe in detail the different pictures what it good for your mind.  I highly recommended for anyone who has some free time and ones to keep his mind occupied.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Oscar Nominee come on it was great.  The writing was  great, acting was great, information was accurate as far as I could tell.  I know a lot about Lincoln but am not a scholar I just like history.  Sally Field should have gotten the Oscar, Daniel Day Lewis did.  Don't watch it after seeing, &#34;Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter&#34; it becomes a whole different movie then.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Goodstory,high appeal for seniors, especially those familiar with retirement facilities.<br />Entertaining story, well direct and well enacted.  Production was tops.<br />Disappointed that someone thought it was necessary to use vular language at times. The &#34;F&#34; word detracts from the whole thing, and reminds one of the  moral breakdown of our society.
0688014291|5.0|The One Minute Manager is simply brilliant. The way the author explains things will have you rethinking your management style. The book is simplistic and insightful. Without a doubt a five out of five for me.
1623420148|5.0|This book is great, easy reading and just FUN !!  I could not put it down, just as described by so many readers.  It is funny to be inside the guy' head for a change.
B007857FOO|4.0|Was excited when it came. Again, no nice artsy packaging on the outside, but that's what you get for used prices. Got what I expected. Thank you.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I downloaded this game but found the settings to be lacking in how to turn off the music, which is extremely annoying to hear.  Anyone who has figured this out please leave a comment.<br />In fact the information about the game is very limited as well.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|Got this used. Disks came spotless! so shiny and beautiful. No real artwork or episode packet inside, and definitely did not come in original packaging, but I guess that's what I get for the used price. Will learn to live without. Other than that, its great. Thank you!
B004SDEP38|5.0|I use to use this back in my Palm Pilot days..loved it then...still do! Keep up the good work guys!
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This little Bluetooth is just what I wanted for my RV. Super easy to set up with a smart phone and was delivered in 2 days.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Really enjoyed the suspense! Great character development. I hated Adora and Allan. I liked it much more than Gone Girl.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I love this app.  Spent hours in the hospital waiting room and this app made the time seem to fly by
B005LAII0I|4.0|Was gift idea. It went over great. Liked it best out of all birthday gifts. So that alone made it worth price.
B004132HZS|5.0|In this updated BBC rendering of Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick Dr. John Watson, the good doctor served in the current Afghan War. He was wounded in combat and obviously suffers from PTSD. It appears that he is also addicted to the adrenalin rush of combat and is more than willing to use violence when needed and shows no regret afterwards.<br /><br />Sherlock is not a sociable person. In fact, he is more interested in solving crimes than for the suffering they cause to others. He often treats others as if they are incompetent and idiots and this behavior led me to think that he may be somewhat autistic--a savant like Raymond Babbitt in the film \\"Rain Man\\" but--unlike the rain man played by Dustin Hoffman--more functional in the real world. Maybe borderline autistic.<br /><br />Season One has three feature films and I bought it.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Great show. Saw it on tv  about half way thru season. Top show. Funny. Something just about everyone likes. Good quality disc.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series was cut off at its prime. CBS should be ashamed for letting such a great series go away.
0307352145|5.0|I found this book to be very insightful. Several months later I still find myself mentally reviewing concepts I learned from this book and making positive/knowledge alterations to my planning. I also find I understand the introverts and extroverts around me much better. A must read for anyone who cares about how the mind works.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie at least brought a ending to a great series. It was very sad for one of the main characters to die.
B005LAII80|3.0|It's okay good effects.  Silly plotline the first time this. Erosion not much better but you can get it for the 3D
B002N44XSG|5.0|This was extremely fascinating an  is perfect for any percy Jackson lover. It reveals some insight to unexplained points in the books. U should read it.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Lovely scenes enjoyed it. Story a familiar one. Triumph of good over evil. I can recommend it.  A good addition to your 3D collection
0061743526|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's aa good book for summer reading. So much better than the movie.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Great you'll love it. The special effects are really special.  Not quite sure about the storyline seems there will have to be a sequel to explain some things.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Need not stuff to do !!! But love the game!!!!!  This is my favorite game to play!  But too short and need more stuff todo !
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Wonderful! Get a 3D tv and get this DVD asap? It's one of the best films for 3D effects and the film itself is so wonderful. Ultimate feel good movie
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like it because I can keep in touch with people  far away!!!! I like the games too!  No complaints yet!!!!
B004HWYTP4|1.0|The movie is great. Lots of fun. Great crash scenes. Now I'm ready to see Red 2. I don't know who to blame for all the stops, Amazon or Comcast. It stopped five (5) times and reloaded.
B007RQ6WCA|5.0|I am able to get my files on my Kindle Fire HD. I would also recommend uploading the PDF file app. Both work well together.
B000Q9ISSQ|4.0|I bought this because I just finished A Walk in the Woods and I wasn't disappointed. This is a very good book that has a very nice mix of humor and fact. He has a way of focusing in the the strange and out of the way, and notices things that I never would. For example, I would notice the big things by the side of the road, but I never would have looked into the history of big things as done here. Very nice book. What kept it from 5 stars was a little too much description of desolate desert, but then Australia is mostly desert. The author is someone I'd like to travel with, and in a way I did.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Needs some improvements.  At first it was difficult to understand but figured it out, I wish it would let you to directly to the Web
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Brings u back to a time when people married and then learned to love each other good story keeps u reading
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son just this game!! Graphics are excellent. Sound effects good. Very entertaining game - popular among the tweens. Great.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|an ok game but makes you waste your time typing up an indifferent review to play more and i dont like this trick!  therefore will have to not ever dl games from Mobigrow.
B00BJDARA0|5.0|this is a great buy i did not expect great picture quality non stop music playing  buy it you won\\"t regret it.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|We have watched this until we know the who movie by heart.  My husband even likes it and that says alot.  We reference this all the time.
B00296A4F4|5.0|We had heard about Glee in relation to a choir song sung by my 5-year-old son at camp.  We were thrilled to find it available through Amazon.  We will certainly watch more early episodes in the future!<br /><br />Our timing was sadly coincident with hearing, only 2 days later, of the sudden death of the young actor who played the football quarterback.  What a loss for Glee and for all of us.
B00B2EWBMI|1.0|like many others I got suckered into watching this movie from the good trailers of it.  complete disappointment.  definitely a rushed inexperienced mediocre attempt.  time would have been better spent doing yard work.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Nothing special about it aside from the fact that it features the minions from the Despicable Me movies. The graphics are fine and the game play is smooth but that's pretty much it when it comes to good things.<br /><br />It's your typical temple run like game where you have to swipe your finger across the screen to move the minion you control and avoid obstacles. Collecting bananas, money in the game, allows you to buy 4 additional costumes (older brother, baby, mom, and then dad). It takes a long, long time in order to save up to get all of those costumes, Even if you are really good at the game. You can buy power ups that you can occasionally use but I have never personally used them because I have never had the need too.<br /><br />Overall, aside from having the Minions in it, which will more then likely appeal to small children who are fans of the films, there is nothing special about this game.
B008Y6WPXC|2.0|So man big name action stars and so many ways it failed as an action film to count.  Almost borderline comedy action, more like tropic thunder than epic masterpiece.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The Kindle Fire HD has no way of telling me how much battery I have left, I usually just give a safe estimate based on how full the bar is. So naturally I wanted to find a way to tell how much battery I had so I looked at the app store and this was the first app that popped up. People gave it good reviews so I figure why not try it?<br /><br />Battery HD not only tells you how much battery life you have but it also tells you how long it would do to charge it (via plug in or usb) and specific how long you can do a certain task before it dies. I love it. It's an incredibly useful app that I will continue using until Amazon releases an update, which I am surprised they haven't by now, that tells me how much battery I have left. Until that day, You can consider me a user of this app.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is the best possible explanation on how death is a part of us. Not to mention that the book is sad yet displays a life in the shoes of a young teen living with cancer. It portrays how you can love someone that may not be completely healthy but continue to make the most of it. This is a true novel with compassion, young love, and togetherness all compact in to one amazingly written book
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is very fun for all ages.  I love it.<br />all my friends lobe to play it and battle each other for the most bananas.
B00CQGU9GG|4.0|The first 6 cd's sound far better than my old &#34;Six Pack&#34;,  Eliminator is a lot louder, and HDCD encoded. I wish the packaging was better. In my experience, cd in paper/cardboard sleeves pick up dust and debris, and eventually scratch the discs. I have 1500 to 2000 cd's, not the first time I've seen this. I will have to get some plastic cases, ensuring long life, not having to buy the cd's again. The sound quality ZZ Top deserved is finally available, packaging is lacking, therefore only 4 stars.
193700788X|1.0|I didn't expect Ms. Harris to end this series how I wanted it to end.  I did expect that the characters would at least feel familiar.  Nothing about this book felt right.  The characters were totally out of character. The events didn't make sense. It wasn't even entertaining.  I wish I hadn't read it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is simply another PC game brought to this Appstore I was surprised to see this available I downloaded this game faster than any other app download in history I literally said &quot;MOM ITS MINECRAFT&quot;She said I don't care if you get it I LITERALLY PRESSED THIS APP RIGHT WHEN I SAW IT<br /><br />So I Really recommend this app for those minecraft fans out there
1451695195|5.0|I not only enjoyed &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;,  I was personally impacted by it and purchased copies for my four children.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|cute and fun to play. challenging enough that I'm not bored yet. most apps i delete after twenty minutes I still have this one and still enjoy playing it
B002UWH8SS|5.0|This show ranks right up there with the very best \\"gone too soon\\" sci-fi shows. I can't believe this was canceled after only two seasons. Closer to Battlestar Galactica than the original Stargate shows. Slow character development and story arcs - this one was in it for the long haul. Definitely a must watch!
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|the only thing you'll need, it's a powerful tool and I continually find new calculations and features that can be used.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|this game is so stinking awful it is impossible to get their hair to actually look nice don't get the game!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was a great movie. Tons of action. A lot of your favorite heroes in one place. The only thing I will say is that I wish it would have included Kevin Costner's character from the movie Waterworld. Granted, he is not a Marvel character... but surely Kevin Costner could have been easily convinced. What else does he have going on these days? I wish Waterworld 2... but sadly, nay. Anyhow, even with the lack of Kevin Costner (or any reference to the movie Waterworld for that matter) this was a great film!
1781162646|5.0|This is a beautifully written, first-person narrative.  The story is a memory, told by a now older man about his days working at an amusement park, which was haunted by the ghost of a young woman who had been murdered there years earlier.<br /><br />Stephen King is masterful at both plot and characterization, and this story is riveting.  The ending is unexpected, but logical and believable.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good novel and a good mystery.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I absolutely love this series and can't stop reading it! I just finished the fourth paperback and couldn't wait till Oct. for the paperback version of this one so I got it on my Kindle! Love it!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This works great for me! Thanks!! I will use this for a long time. I am very happy with my purchase.
B000MGBSI0|5.0|I had the series bootlegged from iffer.com but when I get my refund back at tax time I decided I wanted the whole series regular artwork DVDS, I gave the disk's away the fake one's loved the show, opening music, cast and characters!!!
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|This is a great film with just enough of the ideas from the classic film to be a wonderful story.
0395389496|5.0|I love Chris Van Allsburg books.  His illustrations are outstanding.  I like the way he has a mysterious ending in most his books.
1401224792|4.0|This book has no ties to the main Fables universe and therefore isn't critical to the overall Fables journey. That being said, if you are a fan of Bigby Wolf then you should pick this up for a fun read.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie was very well done.  it showed very accurately life in the early 1900's.  The acting was outstanding, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes intense love stories.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is addictive and fun. You will lose time after you download this game. Very fun, very enjoyable. Download today.
0739343823|3.0|Patrick Lanigan had it all.  A young hot-shot at his law firm, Patrick was a shoe-in to make partner, so he was financially secure.  At home, he had a gorgeous wife and a beautiful four-year-old daughter.  It seemed like he was living the perfect life, but appearances are not everything.<br /><br />Patrick knew his wife was cheating on him.  When his daughter was fourteen months old, he had her DNA tested and knew she was not his.  When Patrick finally discovered that his partners at the firm were working on a crooked deal and planning to cut him out, he decided he had had enough.<br /><br />On the way home from his secluded hunting cabin one day, Patrick's SUV skidded off the road, tumbled down a steep embankment, and burst into flames.  The only thing left of Patrick was a small pile of ash and a few bone fragments.  Several weeks later, his partners received the payout from their crooked deal, 90 million dollars.  When the entire amount was diverted from their bank, mere minutes after it arrived, people began to get suspicious.  They knew that only someone on the inside could have pulled it off.  The firm and their crooked client hire some professionals to hunt Patrick down.  Since the 90 million was defrauded from the US government, the FBI also began a search.<br /><br />Patrick's luck held out for four years before he was finally discovered in Brazil.  Unfortunately for Patrick, it was not the Feds who found him first.  For almost a week, Lanigan was mercilessly tortured for the whereabouts of the money before the FBI finally caught wind and took custody of him.<br /><br />As soon as Patrick is brought back to the US, the law suits start to fly.  He faces the death penalty because of the burned remains found in his car.  His law firm's client sues him for the money he stole, and the firm sues him for the percentage that would have been theirs.  The firm's insurance company sues to recover the fraud protection money they paid out.  Patrick's wife sues for divorce, and Patrick's life insurance company sues her for the money they paid out on Patrick's death.  That's just for starters.<br /><br />Patrick Lanigan spends two weeks in a guarded hospital room, quietly using his attorney and his mysterious partner, who is the only person who knows where the money is, to pull the strings.  In the end, Patrick gets every lawsuit dropped, even the ones that were not against him.  He walks away clean without ever serving a single day in prison.  There is only one contingency that the mastermind never planned for: the greed of his trusted silent partner.<br /><br />The Partner is my second John Grisham audiobook.  The first one I read was The Rainmaker, (there's a link below for my audiobook review).  I liked The Rainmaker a lot, but The Partner was a little disappointing.  It was interesting watching Patrick Lanigan deflect all those lawsuits one by one, and Grisham's methods seemed plausible, but The Partner was kind of a slow-developing book.<br /><br />Frank Muller is one of my very favorite audio book readers.  I think this is one of those cases where a top-notch narrator salvaged a mediocre audio book.<br /><br />John Grisham created an interesting story for The Partner, but ultimately it was not suspenseful enough to be a real page-turner.ce, and Patrick's life insurance company sues her for the money they paid out on Patrick's death.

1611761808|3.0|Ever since I read The Kite Runner and a Thousand Splendid Suns I fell in love with Hosseini's writings.  As many of you were, I was eager to read this book.  I must say the weaving of multi-generations of family in a novel is special and speaks to his genius; it also serves to confuse the writer as sometimes you are in part of the story and need to remember some minor detail from 80 pages ago.  Without a character map it might be hard to follow.<br /><br />The story ends beautifully but getting to the end is a journey much like the story itself.  Maybe by design.<br /><br />The audiobook is TERRIBLE.  He picked three readers, one of whom has a poor command of the English language, doesn't read in punctuation and sounds like Borat.  Just read this one.
055371273X|4.0|Things are not working out quite the way Rudy Baylor planned.  After scratching and clawing his way through law school, he is already having some doubts about his chosen profession by the time he reaches his final semester.  The competition is fierce, and some will go to any lengths to get a leg up on their classmates.  To make matters worse, the law firm that offered Rudy a position upon his graduation was suddenly swallowed up by a much larger firm that promptly informed him that they had no place for him.  Disillusioned and desperate, Rudy grudgingly accepts a position with a rather seedy collection of lawyers who are little more than ambulance chasers.<br /><br />Rudy doesn't know it yet, but the people entering his life during this dismal period will change him forever.  In one of his final classes at Memphis State, Rudy is required to visit a local senior center and offer free legal advice to anyone who might need it.  Here, he meets Miss Birdie; an elderly woman with a large fortune and a family who cares only about her money; and Dot Black, a middle-aged woman whose son, Donnie Ray, is dying because their insurance company won't pay for the bone-marrow transplant that would save his life.  Rudy is very interested in these cases because of the potential for large settlements that would launch his legal career with a bang.  Then he meets Kelly Ryker, a beautiful young woman who is married to a brutal drunk.<br /><br />It is the Black family that occupies most of Rudy's time and energy in their case against their insurance company, Great Benefit.  Great Benefit is represented by a very large and very prestigious law firm; ironically, the same firm that took Rudy's job right out from under him.  They have dozens of high-powered, highly paid lawyers at their disposal.  They make millions of dollars per year, and they fight dirty.  Rudy, on the other hand, just passed the bar a few weeks ago.  It's a classic tale of David and Goliath, but don't count Rudy out just yet.<br /><br />Rudy's motives may have been selfish in the beginning, but his experiences with Miss Birdie, the Black's, and Kelly teach him some things he never learned in law school.

B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I love Alice in Chains, and this album did not disappoint. In all honesty, even though the songs were awesome, they might not be as memorable as other Alice in Chains songs of the past. I know with classical music, sometimes I have to hear a song several times before I fully appreciate it; that might be true here. Because I am an agnostic, I enjoyed and appreciated the song, &#34;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&#34;. I don't want to give this album a negative review, it is awesome and I would recommend you get it.
0143117009|4.0|Jared Diamond offers a perspective in his books that takes you into another layer of thinking.  This book really dives into situations that where simple observations could be and frankly have been made.  He puts those under a microscope and challenges simple conclusions.  That is exactly what was done in this book.  I particularly enjoyed the de-mystification of Easter Island.  Overall, great book.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|I felt the book was well written & enjoyable. It gave great insight into the everyday life of a specialised operative and the training & planning behind such missions.<br /><br />Mark & his colleagues must be very determined & driven people who lead extraordinary lives.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I used to work on James Altucher's books in a former life as an editorial assistant about a decade ago, and he was my favorite colleague. So I could not have been more delighted to accidentally stumble upon this gem of a book by an old friend, just when I am about to contemplate a very choose-myself type of career move. I will likely need to re-read it on occasion to remind me that I have absolutely nothing to lose. This conversational easy read lays out all the tools an aspiring entrepreneur requires in our current bizarre economic landscape, where playing by the previous set of rules no longer pays off. Altucher seems to have unlocked the key to making your own rules & your own luck, if you're brave enough to fail a few times in the process. Pretty inspiring stuff.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it's awesome but I want to know how to update it I have a kindle fire hd now?
0307010856|5.0|I bought this book  when my kids were little then I bought it for my grandkids when they were little now I bought it for my great-great niece.

B0050546IM|5.0|This album really gets the panties off.  The needle hits the record, the panties hit the floor.  This is a friendly record.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked this game.  It wasn't to hard but it is a challenge to figure out some of the puzzles. There isn't a hint button but if you take your time and think you will figure it out on your own. There were only ten levels, hopefully they will add more soon!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I think that everybody should get this app bcuz its a good game and fun and a good time waster
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It fun addicting  nice game  I like it  I would like if the were also purple guys and things cost less on the game
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|I liked the story. I liked the gore! Good Movie! I wish I could give it 31/2 stars. Oh, well. It's better to rent it from one of those machines for $1.99 at the grocery store $3.99 is way too much but this was very convenient and easy to use.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun to play,great plot<br />Loads to do.Would like to be able to do more with the monkey like become the monkey<br />Love the monkey
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Me and my son love to compete to set who can get the best score or the most bananas. Can't wait till my other son can play with us
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game a lot. At first it seems too easy, but it progresses after the 3rd level and is more challenging. I like how the clues to each puzzle are hidden as well as being vague, so you have to do some thinking and deducting. I think this game could be addictive , since every time I advance a level, I want to see what the next level is. This game is like a hidden object game, as well as a puzzle, so for me out is challenging, yet rewarding. I definitely recommend this game. Being free doesn't hurt either!
B000B589JI|4.0|Item arrived yesterday, build quality superb but little bit to big for me to become a key chain.<br />Pouring zippo's fluid using this canister is quite difficult because the respiratory hole is to small
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm a late comer to Evernote, but its boos one of my favorite apps.  I paid to get the premium account and consider it great value (not required, but gives you some addiyional options).  The Amazon Kindle Fire/Droid version is slightly different from the iOS version (which are both different from the desktop and web versions) but once I figured it out,  I was pleased with this app.  It lets me access my key notes and notebooks from anywhere, and this interface is decent.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|At first, I thought the game was stupid, but it's super addicting and fun! You really have to play it!
B006ZN7KMM|4.0|Las Lecturas a mas de ser entretenidas cuentan historias reales. Particularmente encuentro interesante ya que leo de a momentos para entretenimiento.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really good and addictive game. There's little things that make it interesting like missions or daily challenges. I would recommend it. it is basically like temple run and the despicable me game but more exciting. And it's on iPhones so quite a few people are playing it and it is fun to compare scores. Love it
B003HKN52U|5.0|Ordered the movie on a Friday and got it the next Monday, it came surprisingly fast! DVD had not one scratch on it and plays beautifully :) the DVD cover had just one small crease that was easily fixed with a sharpie; would totally buy from them again. Voted five stars only because amazon doesn't have a ten-scale rating :D
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I enjoy it but not exactly sure what should be doing. instructions could be clearer. need a better tutorial. also have to wait quite awhile got the next level to load.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|it has new abilities levels and enemy's isn't that what you need. but that's not all it is fun and you don't get bored
3551354022|4.0|I didn't know where to look for books in German until I recently found some on Amazon. The Book came in good condition and at reasonable price.<br />I would recommend checking Amazon for any material you may need. I have recently purchased 4 Books and have no complaints.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|it sucks i cant even get it on my Android  tablet that not fair. it is a get game in all but it is not fqir that it cant install for surtain tablets and phones and hing of that nature.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love that I can buy an episode I missed or the whole season. In my case I missed the whole season. So it can be a little expensive for a digital version vs. a hard copy. Reason, I will always have the DVD, but how long will I have access to the digital version if I cancel Prime Membership?
B002TZS5GU|3.0|It was oh ok.the movie was long and it drag a lot  and the end was good. But rent it out
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is not a game you can zoom through it takes time. you people who talk about how your children bought packs that's not the games fault. This game<br /> freezes up for my child but I restart the kindle until it works so there is no need to 're download the game and lose your data this game is 1 of the only games my child plays I would recommend it for other children to.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Feel like i am reading parts of Downtown Abbey. Marvelously well written and told impeccably from several different perspectives.One gets the feeling like you have been transported back to the beginning of the 20th century Europe.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Acting is OK. Plot is simple and pathetic. The action scenes are mediocre at best, not only are they uneventful but the suits of armor disintegrate on impact. Bad show, bad show.

I would recommend this book to teachers especially, it's an amazing read aloud and a great conversation starter.  Give this book five stars because I am not the person who wants to pick up a book and read but this book kept me wanting more.

B009ZM74F8|4.0|An entertaining film like may others that propose a scenario of what the future holds.  I would classify this as an enjoyable, light watch.
B009UZBLSG|1.0|I bought two of them. They worked for a little while, but both of them broke. They are now worthless to me.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|First let me say I have come to the Joe B party late.  I had never heard of Joe 6 months ago.  Guitar Center was giving away downloads of 10 of Joe's songs.  That was my introduction to Joe Bonamassa.  So I am not one of those long time fans who are disappointed in him for \\"selling out\\" or whatever they are mad about.  I have read their reviews.<br /><br />I think Driving Towards the Daylight is a great album.  It is very bluesy and all the tunes are fresh and orginal.  Joe does a great job bringing the tunes to life and filling them with feeling and soul.<br /><br />This is my third Bonamassa album.  The first was Ballad of John Henry, second was the Acoustic Evening album, I like both of those albums better than Driving simply because they provide more variety.  But Driving is still a great album that I will continue to listen to for a long time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Although a bit short, The Room is a challenging puzzle game that quite literally makes your head spin. Recommended for anybody looking for a fun, thought provoking puzzle game. Hope to see plenty of sequels!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very good game only regret not more levels. I would encourage you to play it! Any age group would find this app addictive and challenging.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very entertaining game. No problems playing. Best part is the game was free. Recommend this one. Simple to play, you do not have to be a rocket scientist to play.
159463176X|5.0|I would highly recommend that this book be read in as short a time span and with as few interruptions as possible, because there is a large number of interlocking characters that can be confusing to the reader who isn't completely attentive.  Having said that, this book rewards the reader quite extravagantly with a great depth of emotional insight into human relationships and interactions.  There were times, although very few of them, when I had my doubts about the story, but Hosseini skillfully tugs on our heartstrings and constructs a beautifully heartwarming story, and once again left me in tears
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is so much fun I can be on this for hours and its just like temple run which I like because temple run is one of the best game in history and this just became the best game ever even better than temple run
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app is fun with all its gadgets. The different costumes are very interesting also. I can't wait to play even more of it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER IF YOU DON'T GET IT YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON A LOT OF FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0011ETNXE|5.0|The 25th Anniversary edition of Thriller is a really Masterpiece.<br />If you want a Vinyl of the King of Pop, buy it!  Its really awsome
006114665X|5.0|Wars mark turning points in history and none provided as much fuel for change than World War I.  This war, quite a bit like its even more deadly version twenty years later, eventually embroiled almost all of Europe in a struggle of emerging national interests.  The systems of alignment of the late-19th century, with Russia and Germany in a close alliance, was gradually superseded by the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy in the early years of the 20th century.  The full implications of this realignment became increasingly clear as Austria faced the increasingly noisy and dangerous emergence of nationalism on its southern border, a border that faced Serbia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Albania.  As Austria worked to contain this movement, life in Europe became ever more dangerous.  Secret factions in Serbia continuously and successfully pushed into wider zones of Kosovo and then even further east.  This endangered Russia, which was playing a similar game: its expansion hopes were directed southwest, converging on Serbia's plans.  France, long nervous about the growing power of the German state, only recently coalesced into a nation by Bismarck's genius, could not but be alarmed at the massive force being developed by Germany.  France supplanted Germany as the principal ally of Russia.<br /><br />All of this led up to the now-famous moment in June 1914 when Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg throne which controlled Austria and Hungary, rolled majestically through the streets of Sarajevo, a northern Serbian city on a beautiful summer day.  A Bosnian Serb named Princip was in the right place at the right time; he fired two shots at point blank range into the passing carriage, almost instantly killing both the Archduke and his wife.  Then, after a short pause as diplomats unsuccessfully tried to contain Austria's outrage, hostilities between the Triple Alliance and what became most of the remainder of Europe began.  The war began and the crisis that became World War I, eventually involving Japan on the far eastern periphery of Russia, wound its way through four years of ghastly battles, huge expenditures of national treasures, and eventually a devastating peace that lasted only twenty years before the German state would reassemble its war machine and begin again.<br /><br />The Sleepwalkers is a great book of history.  It tells this complex story as three central stories.  First, get ready to drop yourself in to a full discussion of Serbian politics, full of intrigue, deception and secrets.  You will be facing an involved history, only briefly discussed in most histories of World War I.  This is ultimately satisfying since it paints the full background of what Serbia wanted and how it went about getting it.  The story is essential to understanding the causes of the war but it would be best to take notes on the many characters - political leaders, diplomats, and military figures - that populate the first quarter of the book.  Keeping all of this straight is no easy task.  Second, pay close attention to the discussion of what motivated Germany, Austria, Russia, Japan, France, and Britain to do what they did.  Each had their own reasons and understanding these reasons is crucial to understanding what shortly took place.  Third, get ready to see an even larger picture than the war.  Europe was torn apart by the urgent needs and desires of various nationalities.  The formation of the League of Nations, with the consent of almost all European countries, was an attempt to bottle up these national urges.  But it failed to do this miserably as the military power of Germany eventually threw the world into yet another conflict.  The United Nations and the formation of the European Community are more recent attempts to defuse the power of nationalism.  It is in the conclusion to this great history that questions about the durability of nationalism, particularly in Europe, are raised.<br /><br />This is a difficult book but fully worthy of the effort to keep track of so many different threads to this great story.  It is indeed alarming that the world slipped quietly into such a savage war in the late summer of 1914.  The lesson for the future, overwhelmingly dangerous because of the now wide ownership of nuclear weapons, is not to repeat the almost thoughtless drift into belligerence.  This time sleepwalking may not be followed by a rude awakening but by timeless damage to the human race.
B00785P2QC|5.0|very addictive and enjoyable will be hooked on it from day one, no other game comes close to it at the moment for me
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My 18 month old has been watching this for months. over and over and over again. We can't get enough of the minions! Will buy all sequels!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a great way to learn about horse and play with them if you cant in real life. I love this game!!!
B003L16FAE|5.0|Gotta love those 80's action flicks!Glad to see this one on Blu Ray.Enjoyed it at the movies,on VHS,DVD,and now in HD.The only trouble I ever noticed on any remastered movie is a shot of the sky.They never quite get a blue sky shot done right.Got all the 80's classic on Blu Ray!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|We needed to rewatch this before seeing Monsters University.  They are both excellent.  Boo is adorable, and the story is compelling and fun.  Laughter is more powerful than screams! :)
0307271080|3.0|I love Adichie. Half of a Yellow Sun and Purple Hibiscus were great reads! The Thing around your neck is my best read from her so far.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this book but I have to say it did not meet my expectations. The book has some interesting analysis on the race relations, which I highly enjoyed and appreciated,however the main theme of Ifemelu and Obinze's love seemed lost and would resurface in the book sporadically. There seemed to be a lack of consistency of Ifems love to Obinze, she barely thinks of him and in a large section of the book and barely mentioned in her story... she may as well have forgotten him.. (apart from his story of life in UK, coming back...and these sections seemed like afterthoughts, not well developed).. Ifem seems to be self-centered for the most part and selfish.. but I guess its not wrong to unlike the character because I did not like her..<br /><br />Obinze's character - I am an African woman and I think I have a good idea what an African man is.. but I found Obinze to be very fictional, unreal - Adichie did little to humanize him, he was perfect (even when the story was being told from his perspective, he still did no wrong). Fell in love with her at first sight and remained that way.. to me he seemed like a character imagined in a woman's head....a woman's expectation of the perfect guy... an in-genuine and unreal character...<br /><br />All in all the book is a good read, but knowing Adichie and her literal skills, it was disappointing...requires some editing and development of characters...it read like a rushed lazy product from Adichie..<br /><br />I do love the humor and there is lots of it... her father is very funny! I loved Aunt Uju and her mom reminded me of my mom!!
B002NZV68U|1.0|Not only does this film not do justice to Wilder's Wonka, but it also flattens the characters and obliterates the conflict of the main film.  My husband has been incensed for days by this travesty of a film.
B0041VV03A|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Imaginative. Creepy. And now,scientifically plausible. A study of human nature might be the underlying theme in this movie.<br />Bio-creepiness? Try this:[[ASIN:B006Q9M52A Fat Rich Dog]]
0441018866|5.0|Every book has it's flaws but to me they are trivial compared to the positive things about this story. An epic and ambitious story arc, engaging characters. This book is up there  with the big guns of Sci-Fi.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|The game is very fun but one promlem, you have to spend REAL MONEY ON HALF THE STUFF!!!<br />Other than that great game!
B00CATSONE|4.0|The areas detailing Tesla's life are very detailed, engrossing, and interesting. Reads very well other than the odd jumps to being a motivational speaker.
B007TK77QE|1.0|I don't know why we need such depressing books. Boring and slow to read. The worst book I have read.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's ok because it doesn't have as many things as the pc version. My biggest problem is the multiplayer. There is no server multiplayer.
B00B2EWNWG|1.0|For many years I believed that the WORST movie ever made was Howard the Duck, followed by Highlander 2 and Star Trek 5, But I just watched The Man with the Iron Fists; bad doesn't even to begin to describe this insult to film. It makes Howard the Duck seem like The Godfather. OMG this film was poisoning my soul and lowering my IQ so I had to stop watching it. Blech!!!!!
B00BDZV7WQ|5.0|it was somthing new to hear from lil wayne cant wait see what he does next to his next few albums
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Decent plot, albeit slow moving. Nice twist at the end. Sometimes difficult to read due to the use of slang.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is great!!!  It is easy to learn and young and old can play.  You need to be strategic with your moves...that's what I like about it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My and my nephew love this game to death. We are competing against each other to see who can pass whos score.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's pretty fun.  Super addictive and not very easy.  Good graphics and funny.  I would recommend this game for kids and adults.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I got this app and the first day I used it was fun!!!!!! then when I tried to open the app the next day it wouldn't open and it still wont open so I cant play it! ! its driving me crazy but other than that its the best game ever!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I enjoyed this book. it was a good story. Please don't let other people's reviews comparing this book with the book REAL make you not want to purchase either book. People say they are similar when they couldn't be more different. I enjoyed REAL a lot more than I enjoyed Beautiful Disaster.<br />But, both have their own stories. The only similarity is that the guys both fight (but in totally different ways).
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Not bad at all the style of this game is great. It keeps you occupied the reading is easy to understand and the game really fun.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you enjoyed 50 shades you will definitely enjoy the Crossfire series! It's a great read! Hope you enjoy! Eva is a wonderful character!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Easy to use. Can set Multiple alarms. User-friendly custom settings for snooze delay, dismiss methods and for alarm sounds & volume
B00CWV8X04|4.0|Especially if you have any familiarity with anti depressant medications, or know someone who's experienced depression and sought help for it (or not), this movie will hold your interest.  The beginning is so very different than how it ends up, so hang in there if it seems a little talky and slow.  Things will change.
B003JH8LPW|3.0|I kept putting it down, it was interesting and i'm glad i read it but i did want it to be more.....
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I have never etited a photo before...this is easy to use.  I use it on my kindle daily!!!  fun and easy!
B00005UOXN|3.0|Not an essential purchase, but worth having for Billy Idol's extended remixes of \\"White Wedding,\\" \\"Dancing With Myself\\" and a high-energy \\"Mony Mony.\\" Except for \\"Hot in the City,\\" the other dance versions are dispensable. And \\"Rebel Yell\\" remains conspicuous by its absence.
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|The \\"Man of Steel\\" movie is both action and plot heavy, dealing with complex spiritual issues as well as what it means to be human. On the other hand, the action is heavy-handed, with punches, bullets, and other weaponry being thrown at people on a regular basis. This combination of depth and intensity creates a powerful film, both visually as well as in theme. The performance of the story was breathtaking. As expected, the visuals were stunning; the special effects were phenomenally crisp and the scope of the camera was often wide, presenting the scenery itself as a spectacle. The acting was exceptional as well. Shannon's Zod was angry, driven, and resourceful, everything a good soldier is meant to be. His lines were powerful and his intentions and thoughts were practically visible on his face as he acted. Cavill's Superman also performed exceptionally. Each line was delivered with honesty to the character. His part was not really dialogue heavy, but his role was emotionally demanding, requiring sadness, fury, remorse, and empathy at various points in the film. His character is vulnerable and emotional, unsure of himself, which Cavill communicated well. Adams as Lois Lane was an interesting choice, and her role is not given as much screen time for development, but she did do a good job playing a driven reporter, dedicated to her work, even if it means bending the rules. It will be interesting to see where her character is taken in the next film (which is confirmed as a Batman/Superman film according to Comic Con). The standout performances are definitely the two fathers, Costner and Crowe. The fathers, without giving anything away, are given numerous occasions where emotional scenes are required of them. Their sequences were powerful and convincing. I almost cried in the movie twice, and they were involved in them both. Their performances were moving.<br />The story itself was the highlight for me. The story fearlessly stepped into religion, humanness, choice, evolution, and power, stepping out unscathed. There will be many who disagree with the film's presentation of the ideas, even I would disagree in places, but, by dealing with them, they gave the film depth. Also, besides philosophical depth, the movie's plot was gripping from the beginning and, overall, solid. The film revealed just enough of the plot to keep the audience informed and then continued, using flashbacks to catch the audience up as necessary. The plot had no real twists, but the plot was not necessarily predictable (I have not read the comics, but the comics could deal with the story.

B00CDUVDEC|5.0|first off i a m a really big Anselmo fan so i was eagerly anticipating this album after hearing the 3 tracks that were posted i was blown away i missed the extreme side of Phil and sense superjoint is no more and will never be again i was excited with what i heard with those three songs now i will make this short and sweet this is no Pantera or down more like Superjoint on crack! its raw heavy and IN YOUR FACE yes the down fall is there is only 8 tracks but phil said it best when he said i chose 8 tracks so the album doesn't get boring cause its true long albums with many tracks are too long and usually have filler tracks but any way if you want a heavy album to jam out to and mosh it up to this is the album for you PICK UP NOW!!!! Hail the King Of Metal Phillip H Anselmo AKA THE KID ANTON CROWLEY!!
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|The \\"Man of Steel\\" movie is both action and plot heavy, dealing with complex spiritual issues as well as what it means to be human. On the other hand, the action is heavy-handed, with punches, bullets, and other weaponry being thrown at people on a regular basis. This combination of depth and intensity creates a powerful film, both visually as well as in theme. The performance of the story was breathtaking. As expected, the visuals were stunning; the special effects were phenomenally crisp and the scope of the camera was often wide, presenting the scenery itself as a spectacle. The acting was exceptional as well. Shannon's Zod was angry, driven, and resourceful, everything a good soldier is meant to be. His lines were powerful and his intentions and thoughts were practically visible on his face as he acted. Cavill's Superman also performed exceptionally. Each line was delivered with honesty to the character. His part was not really dialogue heavy, but his role was emotionally demanding, requiring sadness, fury, remorse, and empathy at various points in the film. His character is vulnerable and emotional, unsure of himself, which Cavill communicated well. Adams as Lois Lane was an interesting choice, and her role is not given as much screen time for development, but she did do a good job playing a driven reporter, dedicated to her work, even if it means bending the rules.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|This movie was hands down the best Superman movie that has ever been made!  The backstory was entertaining and informative and showed us how Superman came to Earth and how he learned to control his powers.  It also showed us what happened to Krypton and why the main villain wanted to hunt down and destroy Superman.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Another thing that was cool is that we find out that the suit that Superman wears isn't just a costume, it is clothing from Krypton.  The \\"S\\" on his chest is also explained as not being an \\"S,\\" but it's a symbol for hope on Krypton.  It never occurred to me that the symbol could mean something else on his home planet.  It was a very cool twist and very creative!<br /><br />Also if you watch closely, you'll see subtle references to other super heroes and villains in the DC universe such as Batman, Lex Luthor and Super Girl.<br /><br />The best part of the movie was when we FINALLY get to see Superman fight a super villain!  In all his other movies he's just lifted heavy things and flew around.  Unless you count that slap fight he had with Nuclear Man in Superman 4.  So this fight scene with Zod and the other Kryptonians was just amazing!<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />Some people complained that there was too little of Lois Lane in this movie.  But it's a SUPERMAN movie, not a Lois Lane movie.  My only real complaints about the movie is that there is no mention of Kryptonite and Zod didn't say his classic line of \\"Kneel before Zod!\\"<br /><br />This movie was incredible and any fan of comics, Marvel or DC will love it!  Check it out!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love British theater.  My 12 year old thinks it's stupid, but the rest of us love the drama and interactions.
B009PLKPMS|5.0|Disc one may seem a little redundant because some of the songs were on their other greatest hits album but it's a fantastic mix of the best McFly songs coupled with new songs that are less well-known. I would definitely recommend this album to any hardcore McFly fans as well as any budding fans. All-in-all, it was a great purchase.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. Played it with the grandkids and we had a blast!  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzles.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I have owned this game on my computer for a while sand have been addicted so when I seen it for my Kindle Fire HD, I was really excited. Even though it isn't the same as the pc version, it is still fantastic. I have downloaded a couple Big Fish and have yet to be disappointed.
B005CAATXG|5.0|The CD comes in a classic jewel case and the artwork is nice. The CD has its own print on it and the CD includes a booklet with lyrics and band information. This is Icon for Hire's debut album and they did a great job. The songs are fast-paced and heart pumping. I've had a lot of people ask who i'm listening to while playing this CD and for good reason. Awesome album to own and help support the band.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Greatest classic I've read in a while. Steinbeck has done it for me.<br />The ending was a real mouth opener for me.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I mean what can i say its Star Wars!! You cant beat it. Fast shipping and packaged well. Looks great and sounds great in Blu-ray. Its like the movies were made with todays technology. But you dont lose the classic feel factor.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. I play with my friends all the time. They all love it. Everyone should get this game.
B004QMRHHW|5.0|Another amazing album by Amon Amarth. Very heavy guitars backed by thundering drums. Then add the deep, growling vocals. No other band has this kind of sound. Phenomenal!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is so much better than I anticipated. There is some boring formulaic elements, but the strength of the characters and the great dialogue more than make up the difference.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. I love diamond dash passes the time. I love all the different levels best game ever!
B008XGW1CI|4.0|When I first started reading this novel, I wasn't quite sure Rowling, the mastermind of Harry Potter fame, was up to writing a real-life story. Now that I am almost finished, I have nothing but praise for her literary efforts. She has very cleverly taken an ordinary life situation in small-village England and turned it into an affair that packs a lot of energy balanced by an equal amount of pathos. The town of Yarvil has never really generated a lot love within its ranks, simply because its members would rather hate than help each other. There is no civil behavior here, especially when the future of the town is at stake and about to be settled in a by-election for a seat on the parish council, vacated by the sudden death of a popular teacher-advocate. There is a piece of land that is currently being used as the home of a popular drug rehab program, which has now come to the attention of a group who want to sell it for housing development. While the campaign heats up, all the innocence that we come to associate with backwater England disappears. There is a fair spate of nastiness in this story because its citizens don't empathize very well with the needs of its more vulnerable citizens - a generation of young druggies who are going through the rigors of rehab. To keep this novel current, Rowlings introduces the Internet as that weapon that will be used by both sides to wreck the other's chance of winning. In the end, all the political mudslinging will lead to disastrously unintended consequences. Someone who has no interest in dirty politics will lose bigtime only because she can't cope with the changes this vote will bring to her fragile life.
0345529057|5.0|All 5 books were bought as a gift and person was thrilled with them. Will definitely buy the 6th book as well.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Just saw this movie on instant video because I'm too cheap to pay movie theaters their blood money.<br /><br />First thing's first for any would-be detractors: It's a reboot. Not a remake. It loosely follows the same storyline as the original, but is in no way a faithful recreation. And I love it that way.<br />I've seen some reviews claiming that it wasn't scary. It all depends on perspective, I suppose. Personally, it unnerved me bad enough to where I didn't know my body was rigid until the muscles began to ache. (For added ambiance, try watching it in a dark room with headphones on. If you view it on a computer, that is.) The movie's terrific. All of the blood, guts, and violence you could possibly ask for jump at you from the screen.<br /><br />Truly, I wanted to give this flick 4-1/2 stars, but you can't with Amazon's rating system. The only reason I wouldn't give it a true five is because, only occasionally, the dialogue tends to sound juvenile, though it's so sporadic that you barely even notice. No matter--the movie's gory make-up and quick camera cuts pick up the slack.<br /><br />I don't give spoilers because spoilers suck, but it's different than the original. I recommend you check it out for that very reason.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is a great game for all ages. Definitely recommend but turn off your in -app purchases its to easy to spend real money.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Humor, adventure, heroism, Stoicism, all seasoned with a chaste love interest.  Johnson has created a hero but described an environment, a way of life, in the Louis L'Amour tradition.  Lots of fun and I will read another Longmire.

B003VANOFY|4.0|This is my 3rd set (1st broke when it was dropped then stepped on, 2nd had a speaker go bad) and short of a $250 pair from another company I have not found another wireless headset as good.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great sound.  Wireless surround sound is fantanstic, really puts you in the game or movie.<br />- Like the boom mic, easy to use and bends 10-15 degrees as needed to get closer to your mouth.<br />- Volume control on the headset so you don't need to sit near computer.<br />- You can program one of the function buttons on the headset as PTT so again you don't need to be at the computer to talk.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Some popping sounds.  I moved to a new condo a while back and seems like there are more issues with interferance than before.<br />- The new software update from logitic is not good, need to upload an older version to minimize sound and interface issues.<br />- The new software doesn't give much flexiblity to configure the headset.  I don't need to hack the thing but would be nice to be able to adjust the features more.<br />- It is on 2.4ghz, the same frequency as phones and many other devices...there are sometimes interferance issues.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with the headsets and they do what I want them to do for a fair price.  There are a few better sets out there but this is by far the best for the cost and what you get.

B007HACDLK|5.0|A marvelous story by a fellow Minnesotan I had not yet known.  I am among many who regret his loss, I know.  Fortunately, I can work back though his many earlier works.
0316010669|5.0|Having read \\"Outliers,\\" I decided to read Malcolm Gladwell's earlier books, starting with \\"Blink.\\" (I'm obviously going backwards, for reasons I haven't yet fathomed.) \\"Blink\\" did not disappoint. Gladwell presents a number of interesting case studies in various areas (beginning with the intuitive and immediate recognition by the experts of an apparently genuine ancient Greek \\"kourio\\"--a type of statue--as a fraud) to show that our initial snap judgments may give us more genuine insight into a situation than analytic reasoning can do--provided we know what we're looking for. For example, the tennis coach, Vic Braden, discovered that he had an uncanny and almost always accurate sense in advance of when a pro was about to double fault, even though he could not explain the source of his perception.<br /><br />However, while this intuitive perception (which Gladwell calls \\"thin slicing\\") can lead to great insight, it can also mislead. Gladwell tells the story of Amadou Diallo, the immigrant from Guinea who lived in the Bronx. One night police officers gunned him down in a flurry of gunfire because they perceived him as threatening and having a gun, when this was clearly not the case. In this situation, their initial impression tragically misled then.<br /><br />I also found his discussion of the work of John Gottman in studying the interactions of married couples to determine whether they will stay married to be fascinating. By looking at verbal and facial cues, he is able to determine with as high a success rate of 95 percent (if he analyzes an hour of their interaction) whether or not they will remain married. (One reason I found this interesting was that a couple years ago I had a student in a class who had been married for nearly 15 years. The first day of class she talked about her husband briefly. She said nothing that appeared negative about him. However, after class that day, I thought to myself: \\"This marriage is in trouble.\\" When I ran into her the next spring she told me she was getting a divorce. I could never figure out how I knew this in advance, until I read the account of Gottman's work. One of the surest signs that a marriage will end in divorce is if one party is contemptuous of the other. When I read this I realized that, even though this woman had not said anything specifically negative about her husband, it was clear from her intonation and her facial gestures that she had contempt for him.)<br /><br />The one word of caution I have is that Gladwell's hypotheses rest primarily on anecdotal evidence. Although the studies he cites appear to confirm his hypotheses, it would require more studies to establish them with a high degree of probability. Moreover, one thing that he does not adequately address is how (or whether) we can tell if our initial intuition (that thin slicing, or \\"blink\\") is accurate (as it was with the experts on Greek sculptures) or inaccurate (as it was with the police who gunned down Amadou Diallo).she told me she was getting a divorce.

B00CF34B2I|4.0|This is an artistic masterful addition to the magic world and should be your go to version outside of Friday night magic with your friends. Only downside is are the download and install problems but once you get it it's worth the price.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|What kind of ending was that?! The feels.... :( I wasn't expecting that at all. I can only imagine how this will play out in the movie version.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book once I got into it. During the first part I was hard pressed to find a character I actually liked. Also, the language was a little vulgar - I understand the shock factor and that it was supposed to add to the character, but I feel there's more words in the English language that can convey the same thing. Sometimes vulgarity is unnecessary. Nice twist at the end, but not something ill read again.

B005LJETYI|5.0|I found out some days ago that Cruise was filming a movie about this novel. How so? I never heard anything about it before... after reading some reviews I bought the kindle version and ate it in 2 days (is a short reading). What can I say, is dark, a easily recognizable video game vibe, nice characters, and a fit ending. As a fan of anime and asian cinema I give Hiroshi 2 thumbs up, loved it.

0446580848|5.0|DeMille at his best, as he weaves his plot into a local environment, in this case the war on terror in Yemen, as a couple from the NYC Anti-terrorism Task Force tangles with the State Department, CIA and al Qaeda.  A thriller with total integration with both history and current mess of the violence in Yemen.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|As with the previous two books, this story is very polished and an in-depth story of life in Afghanistan.  I would highly recommend it.
B000FFJYB6|5.0|This is a very touching movie, based on the book by the same name, about a boy and his dog growing up in the South during WW II and is based on the real life experiences of William Weaks Morris. Willie, as he was called, was born in November of 1934 in Jackson, Missippi but his family moved to Yazoo City, Missippi when he was only six months old.<br /><br />The story starts in 1943 when a puppy came into the life of Willie, who was an only child and was more interested in reading than sports. In the movie the part of Skip, who was a Fox Terrier, is portrayed by two Jack Russell Terriers, Moose, and Enzo who may be more familiar as they both played the part of Eddie, in the Fraser, sitcom.<br /><br />The movie does a good job of capturing the mood of the era, as a boy, growing up in Texas during that same period, I can relate to much of what is shown in the movie as being typical of that time in the South. Although the movie takes some liberties with the book, it does a good job of telling the story of Willie and Skip.<br /><br />There are some minor omissions in the story, such as Willie's attending and graduating from the University of Texas at Austin prior to his Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford but this doesn't interfere with the telling of the story of Willie and Skip.<br /><br />The movie is well cast and the acting and scenery all contribute to a movie that carries the viewer along on a trip down memory lane. It left me with a renewed appreciation for the precious beauty of life in all of God's creatures.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that Willie Morris was able to fly to New York for a preliminary screening of the movie in 1999; reports indicated he was delighted with the movie. He died a few days later of a heart attack on August 2, 1999.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with the little orphaned Irish girl! The trials that she endures and the triumphs she embraces are so lively. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys getting lost in a great book. A definite keeper!
0763644765|5.0|First of all, we are HUGE Leslie Patricelli fans, so when I saw she had a potty book, we had to get it. We started reading it to our son when he was about 15 moths old. He loves the pictures, and definitely saw the connection to his little potty. (We had his potty sitting out in his room from early on, long before potty training.) As he started to talk more, he would talk about the baby in the book, the potty, the cat, and dog. We have a cat who is usually in his room when he's on the potty, so that definitely resonated. It's true that this book doesn't talk about the mechanics of pottying, but it's cute and enjoyable and engaging. Our son is now 21 months old and potty training, and we still read this book. He cheers when the baby finally goes potty, and he LOVES the Undies page, especially the Superman undies. I think this book definitely helped make the potty seem familiar and non-threatening, and it definitely made undies a great incentive.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Good movie. Good cast. Action scenes are well done. What became of Frosty? Would have liked to see the story go a liitke farther after the big wave.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My daughters one and a half and three and a half love this movie! Cute meaning good animation. Just long enough to keep them engaged.

B00DC7N9NS|1.0|very poor quality and the movie paused several times to load, very annoying would not recommend this movie either as far as I am concerned it is a Disney flop.
1476733953|2.0|This book was BORING.  That is harsh criticism for a sci-fi novel but there it is.  Usually, when a book is this boring, it's because the author has something of some depth they are trying to say and just fails at saying it in an entertaining way.  Wool isn't that type of boring.  It's boring in a way where the author is inconsistent and doesn't really know where they want to go with their novel.  It fails to develop the interesting parts and, in the end, fails to make its point.<br /><br />Wool is about the last survivors of the human race, surviving but living a limited existence underground because the earth has been blighted.  It's implied this was the result of some sort of war.  Later on, the author teases us with the idea that some shadowy bad guys created these silos filled with survivors and then killed off the entire population of the earth and made it uninhabitable.  And then, doesn't go anywhere at all with that plot element.  Like everything else going on in the book, the motivation behind that is pure stupidity and the primary reaction to this is not horror but rather, scratching one's head and wondering why the hell would anyone do that.  We'll never know since the author just drops the subject to focus on incredibly trite, one dimensional characters doing equally stupid things that simply don't make any sense.  There is some sort of conspiracy among a certain group in each \\"silo\\" to keep everyone from each silo ignorant of the existence of others.....to the point that they regularly murder people not just if they suspect, but if they show enough imagination that they might somehow stumble upon this.  Why exactly that is such a problem is....well, like everything else...stupid.  Just about the only smart thing anyone does is take the main guy involved in the conspiracy and toss him out an airlock at the very end....basically so everyone can get on with their boring and trite lives.<br /><br />All this is bad enough.  But the beginning quarter of the book, the author seems to want to go off on far more interesting plot items....changes his mind and kills off every important character up to that point and restarts the novel....for no particular reason at all.  One suspects a better, far more entertaining novel was intended but failed to materialize due to lack of interest by the author.<br /><br />Literally, I put this book down, near the end, because, at that point, I just didn't care how it ended, and read two other, far better novels before finishing Wool off just on principle.  My reward was yet another stupid plot development.  How a bunch of children from a \\"dead\\" silo managed to survive without their parents or a working silo.  Not that the author cares since that plot element is just abandoned at the end....I guess they starved to death.  Who knows.<br /><br />It's not the worst book I ever read.  But it's not what I consider a \\"good\\" novel, by any means.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins is in my estimation , the greatest writer of the past and what is possible in the future, if you are like me. I am fascinated by by the vastness of the universe and how it came about it is mind boggling how little we know.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|I love the Pet Shop Boys and have for 20+ years.  Every couple of months I immerse myself in an all PSB marathon that has served as a real pick me up for years.  That said I have not been a fan of their latest stuff as I thought it lacked the vibrancy and uplifting nature I had grown to love.<br /><br />This new album has everything a PSB fan could want.  Odes to their past, genius innovation, and an energy that is truly infectious.  This work so blows away anything else out there in the EDM genre including Daft Punk who I also love.  It is not that Daft Punk is bad in comparison it is just it is not fair to compare the two proverbial apples and oranges because Electric is on such a higher plane.<br /><br />In a fair world there are a number of songs on this album that are destined to be hit singles including the crafty \\"Love is a bourgeois construct\\" and the current power ballad Vocal with its innovative video.<br /><br />I have Spotify so I have access to the album for \\"free\\" but I went ahead and bought the CD to show my support for the boys.  No matter how commercially successful Electric turns out to be the PSB have given us a real gift and shown the rest of the music community how to make a modern EDM album with depth.  Thank you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love. Love. Love. I am so addicted to pinterest I use it everyday.  I have so many boards from my wedding to recipes to tattooed. I would recommend this to everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this app due to my love of the little minions. I was not disappointed. Expect the fact that when ever I try to go to the main menu ut says loading and it takes forever.Sides this I love the app!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun and so cool I recomend this 4 all ages this is the best horse game ever
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I could not ask for anything more.  The Following are all postive features of this device:<br /><br />It acts as an emergency charger for portable devices.  For those who have left a less than favorable review because of the battery charging capabilities please consider updating your review.  This is a feature that Kingston did not have to add and the device would have been just as good.  What is sad is that reviewers are taking off a star for the lower mah capacity of the battery  for external charging without considering although buying a emergency charger is going to be $30-$40 anyway.  I only paid $60 for this device so removing a star because the capacity of the battery may not adequately or fully charge a 5\\" or larger screen mobile device is not fair IMO.  Also don't forget that you can still use a portable battery with multiple USB ports to charge both the MobileLite and other electronic device, or a portable battery with one USB port for charging which will allow you to plug in your MobileLite, and then your electronic device can charge using the MobileLite USB port.  Just remember that if you use the USB port for charging then you will not be to use the USB port for USB data connection at the same time.<br /><br />The owner of the device can offload and transfer content from there technology devices while in remote locations or on vacation.<br /><br />The device works with memory card readers, YES I HAVE TRIED THIS, which means that you are not limited to just SD card compatibility, but you can use basically any type of memory card but not all at the same time.  If you have a SD card, insert, and read and then if you then want to read lets say a Sony MS card remove the SD card and insert the MS card, no problem. I have a memory card reader with SD, MMC, Sony MS, etc and the kingston passed the test with flying colors. and you can still use the regular SD card slot on the device at the same time as occupying the USB port on the device.  I have not tried theMicro USB port at the same time which will be my next test.<br /><br />You are able to use the Kingston as a bridge device, which means that if you are using a mobile Hotspot or if you are at a hotel that charge for Wifi per device then all your devices will be viewed as one device when going through the MobileLite. No per device hotel Wifi charge will apply.<br /><br />I cannot say enough positive things about this device it is simply awesome and worthy of 5 stars.  I am using the device on iOS and Android and have had no issues.<br /><br />If there were Three things that I would wish for it would be:<br /><br />A small case for the device and the SD card adapter<br />That the iOS app works with older Firmwares prior to v5.1.  I have an iPod touch at firmware 4.3 and cannot not use the Mobilelite APP without first updating the iTouch's firmware<br />A default password should be defined on the unit during manufacturing, which would be the same practices that manufactures use for other wireless protocols such as bluetooth, or WiFi routers<br /><br />The one thing that I have noticed is that the Power button can be a bit difficult to operate since it does nto sit flush with the case and is rather small. for large fingers.<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained about the lack of documentation, and I'm not going to argue that this a valid complaint for them.  However for me getting this unit up and running is a no brainer.  Charge the unit, download the iOS app or Android app, connect to the unit, set a password if needed, and start enjoying your content.  This is what the instruction sheet states and also when downloading the iOS or Android app this is the first thing that is displayed to the user before they even presented with the apps GUI.<br /><br />This is a great product that should be in more stores.  I went to Staples who was supposed to be one of the re-salers and they had no idea what I was talking about and the item was not found in my staples here in the Sacramento, Ca  area.<br /><br />Great job Kingston, keep up the good work.
0307595579|5.0|My first introduction to 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' was my brother, who insisted I read it despite having never heard of the author. (At the time, Stieg Larsson was still with us, and hadn't yet gained notoriety or fame.) I wasn't really interested, truth be told, but I eventually relented since he wouldn't give up. And thank goodness I did.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander has got to be one of the most entrancing heroines ever put to print. Larsson's ability to effortlessly switch between the horrors of abuse to the power of self-discovery makes me jealous.<br /><br />As for the book set itself, my brother does own it. It's beautiful, and also contains a collection of essays I've browsed through more than once while visiting his house. Everything about it is great. So if you're looking for a gift for a loved one, or just looking to treat yourself, give this series a chance.
B00A4AHZZO|5.0|...in the same works in this collection.  Some of Klemperer's best Mozart appeared on Testament: symphonies 29, 38, 39,and 41. #s 29 and 38 on EMI were nearly identical, but the Testament #s 39 and 41 were necessities. Fortunately all of the Testaments are included in this box, together with  the later EMI versions. The sound of both is uniformly excellent  Also, the outer movements of #34 in this box drag c.f Tate and Szell. #31 is on the sleepy side but quite listenable. The outer movements of #36  are quicker than some other readings in the set, but not aberrant in re following the tempi marked: Allegro spirito in the first movement and Presto in the finale. #s 25,29, 33, 38, and 40 are excellent-noble and vital with great plangent winds  which are more than secondary.  #40 is  duly tragic and angry (// the Adagio and Fugue k546) but also quite beautiful ( in the second movement and third movement trio).  The Overtures and Serenades are more consistent. Serenades #s 6 and 13 could use more  energy, but the three wind Serenades (#s 10-12) possess immense clarity, novel (to me)  interplay among the winds, and care.  Klemperer was a lifelong wind maven, and it shows  in most of his conducting.     Some peers: Jochum/ BRSO in #s 33, 36,39-41; RCOA in 35, 36, 38 and 41;Bamberg SO in #s  33, 35,36,and 38-41; Tate/ECO/EMI all of the symphonies here. Krips/RCOA/Philips in #s 25, 29,31, 33-41; Szell/Sony in #s  33, 35 and 39-41; Dohnanyi/Cleveland/Decca in #s 35, 36, 38 and 39-41;  Bohm/BPO/DG in  #34+ Overtures and Serenade #10; Maag/LSO/Decca in the Serenade #6 and Symphony #38; Kubelik/BRSO/Sony in #s 35-41.  Sawallisch/Czech PO in #s 38-41; Colin Davis in all the symphonies here.  Marriner/Philips, DeWaart/ Phiips and Lehmann/DG in the Serenade #10- De Waart in #s 11 and 12. Jochum/Bamberg SO/Orfeo in the Masonic Funeral Music; Colin Davis/Dresden/Philips in the symphonies and RCA in the Overtures.  Other best Overtures:  Erich Kleiber/VPO/Decca in Figaro; Krips/VPO/Decca and Mitropoulos/VPO in Don Giovanni; Jochum/BPO and Bohm/VPO (twice) in Cosi; Bohm/VPO/Decca  in the Magic Flute; Jochum/DG in Abduction.  William Steinberg/Pittsburgh/EMI in #s 35, 40, and 41
034580404X|5.0|I waited to write a review of this BDSM trilogy until the brouhaha calmed down.  As a degreed English Literature major, I will say up front that this is not great literature.  It is poorly written, predictable, and or so repetitive.  As a lifelong BDSM Dom, it also is not truly representative of our lifestyle.<br /><br />In short, it has been rightly called \\"Mommy Porn\\".<br /><br />However, it is a ground breaking opus.  These three books reached a wider audience than any other kink book ever printed.  They spawned an entire industry of parodies and products that we will see for years.  I mean, when was the last time Costco carried a BDSM novel with graphic descriptions of sex?<br /><br />Should you buy it?  That's up to you.  But you should read it and become familiar with its plot and characters just to take your place in this social tsunami.
B00CS7ZIHI|4.0|I enjoy this album, it's the first I've really listened to for this band, but it's what I expected from such an interesting talent.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like this app a lot!  Has pop- up ads, which can be annoying.  But it offers different scoring options.  Pretty wide selection of backgrounds and card styles. Very pleased with it, actually downloaded a second time after accidentally deleting it.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Jodie Foster is great in this movie. Very believable.<br />I saw this movie when it first came out and enjoyed it then, but as my views later in life have evolved more toward skepticism and science I now have a real appreciation of the fundamental message this movie conveys.<br />If you enjoy science intermingled with drama, action, a good story and great acting I would recommend this movie to you.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|This is by far my favorite album by the amazing trio, Lady Antebellum. I appreciate the slower pacing than Need You Now, but still can't help my foot from tapping at the first track, 'We Owned the Night.'<br /><br />A lot of my friends don't rate this as highly as their previous album, but I have to disagree. I think this is a musical evolution, and certainly worth taking a look at. (And who doesn't love Lady A?)
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|fun game. couldn't put it down once I started, but some places its a headache trying to get the monkey to the next jumb when trrying to get to the diamond.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Was not very interested in this book. They auther needed to find more discriptive words instead of repeating the same facial expression every time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really enjoyed this. game! wish there. were more challenging as it went and didn't get boring.  hope more levels available soon!
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a very addictive game. I highly recommended it for everybody. I find it a little easy to win. Maybe it can be a little harder to win.<br /><br />Jack
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Over all works well. One small problem is when editing the document for the first time using the enter and back space keys do not get reflected in the display. I have to save and open again to get it to work.
B005I4JG80|4.0|This is a lot more like a story then a parenting book. It does have some great experiences that you can draw advice from but its definitely just advice.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can't begin to understand why somebody wouldn't read this.  I just finished it and I still have tear marks on my cheeks. I didn't really want to read it at first but i did anyways because everybody is talking about hoe amazing John Green is. This is the first book that I read by him and all I have to say is : oh my God. If you aren't reading this then I don't know what you're waiting for
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Wonderful is all I can say about this. Even my kids loved it. Got is as a gift for my sister and she loved it too
B001UG56ES|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite movies.  It had drama, love, and a little boy that I was crazy about.  I often use the phrase, &#34;I will sing you to me.&#34;
0694003611|5.0|I remember my mom and dad reading this book to me and I read it many times to my kids. What fun it was to look for the mouse...Whenever I have to go to a baby shower I get this book to give.
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|The RCA recordings of Arturo Toscanini were comprehensively released by RCA in the 1990's along with VHS and laser discs of the Television Concerts of the late 1940's and early 1950's. At the time, the CD's were sold individually in common plastic jewel boxes as well as in a complete set for which RCA supplied a small piece of furniture (!!) to house the collection.<br /><br />The individual CD recordings of that series are now out of print and have been selectively reissued in alternate packaging.<br />The Television Concerts are available as DVD's in the Testament series.<br /><br />The complete CD collection, however, is now reasonably priced and elegantly packaged in a less-unwieldy edition which includes<br />previously unreleased BBC recordings from the 1930's as well a DVD of &#34;The Maestro&#34;-an excellent biographical film of Toscanini which had been part of the RCA video series in the 90's.<br /><br />The CD's are housed in individual cardboard slipcases which duplicate the covers of the original CD's. The original outer slipcases for multidisc selections have been omitted. The rear (or in some cases the interior) of the cardboard sleeves contain track listings and playing times and essential recording information. Missing, of course, are the lengthy liner notes (in English, French and German) which were found in the original CD booklets. (Alas, it is the printing of the booklets which today accounts for the largest expense in issuing a compact disc!) A hard cover booklet is included which briefly describes Toscanini's work and lists the disc contents by disc number as well as a grouping by composer.<br /><br />Sony/RCA has taken the time and care to print (legibly) the repertoire on the spine of each cardboard sleeve (unlike the many other large volume releases-which unforunately seems to be the norm these days).<br /><br />The musical content, of course, speaks for itself.<br /><br />All in all, an affordable and worthwhile investment in one of the greatest musical legacies of the 20th century.
B0002ZDVF4|5.0|Left our DVD in a machine in Florida by accident.  Had to get a new one. Good price, great movie.
B0055S348W|3.0|When you open an excel document for printing it opned as a pdf. So it was looking weird and was not able to print it.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|Inventive low budget take on vampires very entertaining. The acting was solid and there was very little dopiness in the plot. good take on survival horror.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I first have to tell you that The Kite Runner is one of my favorite reads of all time.  I also truly enjoyed the author's second novel.  I eagerly purchased this third book, but was quite disappointed.  Although the writing was as eloquent as ever, the story line was completely confusing.  I am an avid reader and still had to repeatedly go back and 're-read parts just to try and understand who he was talking about or where the characters were at the time.  An editor should have caught the inconsistent story line.  I will still give it three stars, but I have to admit that I will not recommend this to anyone.  Huge disappointment from a clearly gifted author.
0679890475|5.0|I remember my mom and dad reading this book to me and I read it many times to my kids. Whenever I have to go to a baby shower I get this book to give.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Some chargers have a giant piece that sticks out when you plug it in.  This one is pretty much flush to the car charging port when you plug it in.  No problems, have one for every car.
B009UNGYHG|3.0|Works as advertised. Loses two stars because I shouldn't need it! This is just an opportunity for Plantonics to make $30 off of you because they couldn't be bothered to put a MicroUSB charger on the device. I shouldn't need any accessories.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in this series, but the third one is just not as good. Surprise ending that wasn't too cliche was a nice touch though.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|The only real issue i have with the movie is that why did they use an old Lincoln? For some reason that bothered me. Other then that The Lincoln Lawyer is a solid adaption of a entertaining book
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Good movie however could have done a better job in the story, was a little too long as well. thanks
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|we had this on tape and already knew we liked it. just wanted it on dvd would recommend this movie
B005R32L66|5.0|Wow, see her on screen and the volume while communicating with my daughter  who is serving at Kuwait was so clear.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this game  except for the survival but I like it!<br />I think the game is a good thing for your business!<br />I like it! I think that it is better than potato MINES!!!!! HAHAHA!<br />I like to see if you are not the other side of the USA and Canada is better than zombie school.LOL!<br />anyway,I hate zombie school.you  should visit other states .
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was hesitant to read the sequel to the Hunger Games because they are usually not as good as the first book, especially with all the hype over this series, but I actually really enjoyed it and thought is was well done. Gives you a new story line to follow while still being a follow up from the previous story.
B00846REIS|5.0|I'm liking Gideon better than CG!!!  He's so attentive, love that character. Can't wait to download book #3 .  Hope they never end.
0756407915|5.0|The Wise Man's Fear did not disappoint. It was a great continuation of The Name of the Wind. Rothfuss sure knows how to write. I am so taken by this tale, it immediately goes up in my top 5 favorite STORIES EVER. I not only can't wait for the third and final book but the movie.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I really enjoy this game..Very addicting and fun to play..We need more games like this one that you can add more levels to keep up the great work
0783225725|5.0|this is a classic and now that I own it it's even better since I can watch it over and over again!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I wish you could delete posts and comments from the mobile app. Also would be handy to be able to see the activity log. otherwise it seems to work pretty well.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Loved the movie - great acting, the depiction of Lincoln's personality, and the entire idea of the movie, as it was more of a behind-the-scenes, intellectual historical piece, as opposed to a movie filled with action-packed battle scenes. I would watch it over and over again!!!
1423101502|5.0|This book is the best book in the world. You will not understand it unless you read the other books though
B00336HOU2|4.0|Enjoyed this one. Kind of veers off into a strange direction at the end but it was still good movie to watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is amazing I love it I have about 50 games on<br />my kindle fire and I like them all but this is probably my favorite
140006922X|3.0|I just finished reading Excerpt: Zealot: The Life And Times Of Jesus Of Nazareth. I think his English comprehension has some problems. For example: \\"He was a man of profound contradictions, one day preaching a message of racial exclusion (\\"I was sent solely to the lost sheep of Israel\\"; Matthew 15:24), the next, of benevolent universalism (\\"Go and make disciples of all nations\\"; Matthew 28:19); There is no contradiction here. Christ says he was sent to the lost sheep of Israel, but he was sending his followers out to the rest of the world.<br /><br />\\"Crucifixion was a punishment that Rome reserved almost exclusively for the crime of sedition.\\" If that was true, then why were they crucifying common criminals along side Him? If Christ was guilty of sedition, why was Pontius Pilatus willing to let him off with a scourging? As Reza Aslan points out, many of the false messiahs were readily put to death.<br /><br />From what I have read of the Excerpt, I come away with an image of Jesus, straight out of the Jesus Freak Movement of the 70s. To begin with unlike some of the false messiahs, like a poor shepherd named Athronges, Christ was educated and respected. He was often addressed as Rabbi. In Jewish society Jesus would have been trained by Joesph, his father, to be a carpenter. Being the eldest son, Jesus would have inherited the family business and the responsibility of caring for Mary and his siblings at the time of Joesph's death.<br /><br />\\"What I'm fascinated by is that out of that dozen or so so-called Messiahs in first-century Palestine, only one of them is still called 'Messiah.'\\" If you believe that Christ was the Messiah, then why would it be so hard to believe that he is the only one that has stood the test of time?
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Fun game. Quick, so play moves. Easy to connect with friends. Encourage others to join. I have a lot of fun playing. Worth playing
B001CDZZI6|5.0|I actually re-purchase a new code every year and re-take the survey (three years so far). I love the consistency of the results, as well as new insights reflecting changes in my life. To-date the repeated tests have revealed one new strength every year to add to my list. It reminds me what my core strengths are, and why I need to focus on them for best life results. It's great to do anytime (I seem to do it every summer), but could also be great for New Year goals. Again, I highly recommend this for everyone interested in focusing on their strengths in life and gaining greater personal insights.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book is a thorough step-by-step how to guide to navigating today's changing economic and social environment. If followed I believe it can enable anyone to enact massive change and inspire individuals to soar above the new normal. Now for the hard part ...
B00BFHZOCG|4.0|Great musicianship!<br />You can tell they had fun doing this!<br />Great to add to your collection. To me, its one of the best cover tune albums I have heard.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|This idea might not have np been enough o carry a whole novel, but Scalzi kept it going, and didn't hesitat o take it deeper. Excellent read.
B004KBSQOW|4.0|I bought this CD mainly for the title song, &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34;, which I first heard in the movie &#34;Finding Forrester&#34;.  The rest of the CD is very soothing, as well.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I really like this game. It's  fun to play with to people. My boyfriend and I play against each other.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is like the awesome its thing on plant earth. you should try it some times. it is so cool
B003B02O0A|5.0|I have read Grisham for several years but have never gone back to read some of his original stories. I found this to be a book I couldn't wait to get back  to again and again. I enjoy his way of telling the details and making the story line believable but I have never read one that kept me glued to it like this one.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is such a great movie that will move anyone. One on my top list of all time, Love it!!
1781162646|5.0|Don't really know what hard case crimes are, however it was a good read. Not overlong like some of his works can be. He always creates truly unique stories and characters that are very believable.
6305511055|5.0|Another great &#34;old&#34; movie.  I remember seeing it in the theatre and couldn't believe the beginning scenes.  I'm a huge Robert Redford fan.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a fun game. Fun to play. with a group. of people.  Love it! Love it! Love it! love it!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh is so very pleasant to listen to.  His is modern music that is palatable == which most of today's music isn't!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've never been into zombie movies and was very reluctant to start watching the series, but boy am I glad I did!  Love it.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|The beginning was a little slow getting to the main theme.  After that I found the movie was exciting and interesting.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a great app to have on your phone.  Because most people carry their phones everywhere..... But do not carry a flashlight with them all the time....<br />Thanks,<br />Mary
B000CNFC76|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband who couldn't stop talking about it when he watched it on TV.  A great underdog story.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|We started watching it the other day and powered through the fist season in one day! It took a few episodes for things to smooth out but we really enjoyed it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The British are very adept at the historical drama. The acting, the costumes, and the setting are excellent.  I loved the quite accurate attention to detail that was employed to great effect here.  The series that I thought was the only one that even came close to the quality exemplified here was Upstairs Downtstairs. I think Downton Abbey surpassed that series<br />in all categories. I look forward to the next episodes with great anticipation.
1781162646|5.0|My criteria for a great book is to take me away for awhile.  To be absorbed in someone else's angst and problems or great life.  To give me a mystery and have me solve it if I can.  Mr. King has done that again.  As a story teller, he is one of the best.<br /><br />This book reminds me of the days of Cujo.  It is not The Stand, of The Dome, but a wonderful story of a great character and how he lived his life one summer.<br /><br />I don't like reviews that give away anything in the book.  That being said, all I can say is its worth the read.  The fact that it came in a book form and not download to my Kindle - well, I would have preferred my Kindle.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is outstanding television... All the characters have depth and intimate personalities that are well developed. It's one of the best shows on PBS! I really enjoy watching this program now at my leisure thanks to Amazon...
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|I love this show on TV and in the movie threatres and now on DVD or Blue-Ray.  I like the story line, when I want to drift away from my boring everyday stuff.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game it passes time and it testes your brain and memory. And it's really fun. You don't need the Internet to play.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci did it again.  From page 1 to the end, I was captured in the intrigue and could not put it down until I finished it.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|***Warning: Contains Spoilers***<br /><br />First off, I want to say this:<br /><br />THIS BOOK SHOULD HAVE HAD A TRIGGER WARNING!<br /><br />It took me two days to even begin to write this review, that is how upset I was made by this story.<br /><br />There wasn't even one, ONE, cautionary message about reading this novel and the abuse it contained within it. All you get is a message about being a victim of sexual abuse and a number to call on the LAST PAGE! Normally, if I KNOW it's coming, I can prepare for it. But I didn't and that just angered me.<br /><br />I want to say 'hey, you don't even see it' but that's not true! Oh no, you get a slight scene where you actually get a flashback - and even if its not detailed, its ENOUGH to know what is being done! But let me backtrack here.<br /><br />I picked up this book because my friend recommended it, telling me that when she read it, she thought of me. That I was like Sky. Reading the beginning, I even said the same thing. Her aversion to gifts, her locked down emotions, the \\"completely and comfortably numb\\" - I was Sky, because I'd been there. I'd felt the same things - or not felt them, as the case may be. Even then though, I couldn't possibly know what would be coming next.<br /><br />At 10%, I got a bad feeling. When Holder follows Sky out of the store and finds out her name, only to ask her \\"are you sure?\\" I knew something wasn't right. Nobody asks you if you are sure of your OWN name unless something just isn't right. I thought, \\"oh man, I'm gonna guess she was kidnapped as a kid or something!\\"<br /><br />Then, I'm reading, reading, reading. I'm not really disturbed by Holder's behavior. I felt it - and Sky did too. Perhaps she didn't know WHY he acted like he was acting, but she knew something was wrong. It would've hurt my feelings too, but all the same, I didn't think him stalkerish or abusive, even when he grabbed her wrist. When you find out why later, you're thinking \\"Oh crap, I'd be upset too!\\" and maybe even lose your cool like he did. Holder is intense, there is just no other word for it!<br /><br />Suddenly, BAM! you're hit square in the eyeballs when Sky finds out the truth of her life. Buried past? Sure, but I think its misleading! I get it, the book needs to have secrets, twists...but really? REALLY? This was BEYOND a buried past that anybody would see coming!<br /><br />It got worse. Problem is, now that I was invested, I had to keep reading. And the way things tied up? What a load of crock! Wouldn't it be nice if life tied up in a nice little bow? I felt sorry for Sky's mother - and felt she did the right thing. The system let her down and so she took the problem on all by herself. Especially because the same thing had been done to her.<br /><br />Disgusted, that's how I feel. Colleen's writing though was exceptional and pulled me in, kept me there which is the 2 stars. The story though...I know it was necessary for a happy ending but some of it just didn't ring true for me - although that doesn't include the sex between Sky & Holder; everybody reacts differently to the things that are done to them and she felt things for him that she never had with anybody else.<br /><br />I liked the epilogue though and loved how the pinky thing was explained so...because it was sweet and I really enjoyed the chemistry between these two, I am giving it a 3.<br /><br />I'm not even reading Losing Hope because I simply cannot go through any of this again. Please, for the love of whatever, put a warning. Please!<br /><br />*I posted this same review over on Goodreads*e even lose your cool like he did.

B0015T6G2G|5.0|I was intimidated by the length of this book at first, but ended up devouring it. Mandela is not just an extraordinary leader, but a writer with a strong voice who manages to give life to modern South African history. It's been a really inspiring, educational and somber read for a man who's witnessed and experienced so much.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Where do I begin? Let's see:<br /><br />1. Sade's performance - fun, sexy and nearly flawless.<br />2. The band - absolutely superb.<br />3. Song selection - nearly all of the fan favorites are covered by this concert.<br />4. A/V - The blu ray looks amazing and sounds superb (and I am an audiophile with somewhat snobbish tastes on A/V).<br />5. The set - top notch job on lighting and background computer technology to accent the performance.<br /><br />I have watched this Blu-Ray 15-20 times already. If you have nice A/V equipment this Blu Ray is like bringing Sade into your living room or home theater. I would give it 6 out of 5 stars if I could. If you like Sade then this is the definitive Blu Ray to add to your collection.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Cool. Awesomeness. Lovely. Frustrating. Annoying. Boring. Long to get to the goals. It is ok but not my favorite game.
B00AA2I2NK|5.0|This is a very good cd to get for the first one of Ludovico's. It shows so many sides to his music. It is excellent.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The new version is not as easy to navigate. On a small screen it is too easy to hit the wrong spot and end up with an ad.  Annoying.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|A great addition to our Die Hard Collection! A must have! Amazon Prime Shipping was on point! Would recommend to any Die Hard Fan or general movie goer.
B008WZHWCE|5.0|After five minutes I almost gave up on this movie, I am extremely glad that I didn't.  The movie was extremely absorbing and compelling with intertwining stories.  One of my measures of a good movie is if I am still thinking about the movie or story the next day, I am still thinking of this movie 4 days after i watched it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game can be addicting but is lots of fun. Sometimes I find myself playing this instead of doing what I need to be doing.
B0009A40ES|4.0|A great black comedy/satire of men's vanity and the 80's Wall Street lifestyle! Christian Bale's dynamite performance gives it a big boost.<br /><br />Special features leave a lot to be desired, though. The two commentaries by director Mary Harron and writer Guenivieve Turner (I hope I spelled it right) are interesting enough, and the deleted scenes are ok, but everything else is just a plain lump of boring.<br /><br />But for less than $10 this was a great buy.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|The perfect summer blockbuster music!  It's got the beat and strength that makes you want to go out and fight kaiju, (or undertake other physical activity of your choice.)
B0026IUXO2|4.0|Very fun movie, but it isn't a history lesson.  I will say it was enough to make a person want to explore more about Elizabeth and her Tudor family.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|My wife and I saw this at the theatres when it came out. Was so good that my wife wanted to add it to our Blu Ray Collection. Amazon Prime Shipping was super fast as well!
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I am so happy I read this book. It made me fall in love again. Etienne and Anna are so awesome! I love them both!
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I really enjoyed the first season however there's only like eight episodes so what could have been a great start is short lived....
B0083VP2KQ|5.0|This latest BBC dinosaur documentary combines well-done CGI with the newest discoveries and the dinos that nobody's heard of. Add them together (and throw in John Hurt's voice), and you get a documentary that rises above BBC's masterpiece Walking with Dinosaurs.<br /><br />A great purchase for the dinosaur-obsessed family!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a fascinating, wonderful view of a famiilie's life in Paris and Afghanistan over several generations.  It held  my attention.  I was pleased with the whole story.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Love the album but the order of the tracks don't follow the movie. After watching the movie quite a bit here is the playlist I've created, hopefully it will help other's that are frustrated in the song list. Other than that it's a great start to a new Superman Era.<br /><br />1. Look to the Stars<br />2. This is Madness!<br />3. DNA<br />4. Goodbye My Son<br />5. Ignition<br />6. Launch<br />7.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Ok its not tht i wanted a fairy tale ending, but seriously????? i LOVED the first 2 books in the series. but u see, the whole reason any of this happened to katniss was because she was trying to protect her sister and then in the third and final book, PRIM DIES!!!!!!!! SERIOUSLY???????? NOT ONLY THT BUT SHES KILLED BY GALES WEAPON!!!!!!!! GALE KILLS PRIM!!!!!! and then of course it never tells u wat happens to gale. i swear the whole series goes like this. first book: loved it truly amazing. second book: she has to go bak????? wow. third book: BOOM!!!!!!EVERYBODY U LUV DIES!!!!!!!!! i wanted to chunk it across road, let it get run over several times, tear out each and every page, burn the cover, shred the pages several times, bury everything, and then dance on the remains. end of story. but then again an author who can make u feel a great amount of emotion over made up characters and events is truly fantastic. i luv suzzane collins, but not everything about her third book in this particular series. the writing was dazzling. the plot was agrivating. the overall outcome was ENRAGING
B000SL1Q2C|1.0|Was not what expected and had to return it and waiting for credit to be issued for item soon I hope.  The company however did respond immediately to my complaint and customer service was helpful.  Sorry I was not happy with the purchase as I truly wanted the item.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I love feedly, its a great google reader replacement. I like it way more than PULSE or any of the other options because it allows me to create my own categories! Keep it up Feedly!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is a great follow up to the original Weaphones. I highly recommend this app and I hope in the future that they add Russian and British guns.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game lets you keep going without worrying about how many lives you have or how long until you can get more. You don't have to bother your friends with requests to keep going.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Excellent back story and tie up to all of the loose ends.  She could've ended the series here and I would've been satisfied.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Lots of special effects, but Hollywood seems to rely on them way to much now days. Guess that's why we don't go to the movies or rent much anymore.<br /><br />Bruce was good, but needed some help to carry this movie over the top. Didn't get it...
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|If you have a spouse and kids and a mortgage and you love to stress over them, you might like this movie.  I however was just looking for some light comedy to escape those worries.  it has a few laughs, but not enough to balance out the constant arguing. Plus, when are they going to stop making these movies so damn long?  1 1/2 hours is plenty.
B00785P2QC|4.0|If only I could get my environment level above zero I'd like it better! Other  than that it's  a fun game!
B00CFA227C|3.0|I would not have missed watching this - I made it thru but considered not finishing it just because the giants were cool.  The main characters were not memorable...and worst, there are no special features.  I liked the now white (huntsman version) but this story was terrible albeit preditable.  The actors could have saved it - but no such luck.  Rent; once.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|In The Kite Runner, an excellent book, we followed one male protagonist throughout.<br /><br />In A Thousand Splendid Suns, a brilliant book, we followed first one female protagonist, then another who was closely connected with her.<br /><br />In And The Mountains Echoed, we start by becoming emotionally involved in the lives of a young brother and sister. The narrative is initially gripping and what happens to the children is heartbreaking. But instead of following the youngsters and allowing their lives to unfold, the author then bounces around through stories that are unrelated other than that they all touch in some way the family of these youngsters.<br /><br />The problem with this literary device is that not all of the stories are equally compelling. I found myself at times almost bored with the book and at other times spellbound. But when I was engrossed in the tale, it would end abruptly, and when I was bored, of course it went on far too long. I could handle the less-interesting stretches. What bothered me far more was when I because invested in a character only to see him or her abruptly disappear from the book.<br /><br />Oddly, the original brother and sister become among the least interesting adults in the book. Furthermore, the ending is ultimately unrewarding. It does seem to tie up some loose ends, but in a rather unsatisfying manner.<br /><br />Still, the book is largely very well written, despite the fact that it loses its way at times. It simply isn't as good as his first two books. But I am sure I shall read the fourth. I just hope it doesn't bounce around quite so much.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|If you liked the other lord of the rings movies. You'll love this one. Amazing story! Definitely watch this awesome movie
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Easy to play and great to keep kids entertained ... fun for the whole family and a great way to pass time while waiting at the doctor's office

B00D3V5V7U|1.0|Without Bill Ward's drumming, this just isn't Black Sabbath.  Bill Ward's drumming was the glue that held it all together.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Good dude flick.  Lots of violence with the occasional over the top drama that you have come to expect from Tarantino.  Go for it.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|I love this movie and the blu ray is beautiful. Lots of great special features. I really enjoyed all the Hawaiian history feature.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|In so in love with this game it's so fun it's hard when you first play in my eye's it's one of the best games ever
B0049P1VHS|4.0|Very good series! Full recomended. Take your time for buy this item!!! With subtitles in spanish is very nice!<br /><br />Chao
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited for months for this book to come out.  After two delays I was expecting finality and completeness and this book turned out to be a total pointless journey.  There is no change in this book that is completely expected and it answers nothing.  It was complete filler - like a uneventful episode of a soap opera.  I don't know what her editors were thinking, but for the first two books to be so good, and this to be such a disaster tells me that someone should be fired. I have recommended this series to so many others and now I feel like I totally misled them.
B00004WF68|3.0|Mr Fantasy is the best one on the disk, a lot of lesser songs, but it performs and is original.  A lot of the old albums (these are remastered, they didn't have cd's at the original release. Have filler songs, I think we called em. Ones you put up with to hear the Tops hits.
B002R1Q8RO|4.0|I can see why Ashton Kutcher was involved with this woman for a while.  This move had some funny moments and it had hot girls in it.  If that's all you are expecting out of it then you should like it.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|The is a good movie, shows things from a different stand point and just how woman of color were treated back in the day
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Anyone who played video games in the 80s and 90s would enjoy this. Also good for older children- maybe 8+?
B0073X0IOA|3.0|I decide to check this book out because it was highly recommended; however, it covers a large amount of mathematical problems and I am still trying to figure how most of the steps are applicable to every day use. Still reading at times and may have to update this review if things click.
B0068FYZV6|5.0|Brand new DVD. Is exactly what the description says, it is the 100th anniversary edition and there is the digital copy as well. Definitely worth the money.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|i loved this movie in 3d! i had to get it in blue ray! the picture is the best! i love it!!
B000B589JI|5.0|The product works great. It's kinda bulky, but it hold the perfect amount of fluid for an on-the-go refilling. Holds and flint and has a tool for the flint housing. Fantastic. Hasn't leaked on me yet!
B002Z5FM74|4.0|I like it... It is durable and works well,  but I like speed not very much... But for the price good one
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The third season is as good as if not better than the first two seasons.  The BlueRay quality is great which makes the scenery just jump out at you.  Highly recommend you add this to your collection.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|I don't consider myself a &#34;Trekkie&#34; in any way shape or form. Nothing against them, just not my way. Be that as it may, I found this story one of the best I have read (or seen ). Mr David Mack is truly a story weaver. He not only told a great story, he answered questions I have always had about Dr. Noonin Soong. He mixed together small bits of many different SNG stories and helped me understand things that were left out in those stories.One story,Brothers, left me confused for along time, but I now get the whole idea.<br />  I think anyone that enjoys the escapism of SNG will enjoy this book as much as I did. I look forward to the rest of the trilogy. Excellent work Mr. Mack!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Sometimes these type puzzles can be so hard and frustrating but this one is not that way. It is so much fun because it's challenging and yet quite solvable. I loved it and look forward to getting more puzzles like it.
B00AWFEBDK|4.0|A different treatment of the human condition from books past but just as scholarly and thought provoking. Very relevant for anyone living in the Western world and facing the dilemmas associated with that lifestyle.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I wish you could see your best time or score before you played a game so you would what to shoot for.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Another great Reacher novel. I don't know how Lee Child can pump these out so fast and still be on top of his game.
B0065AR71E|5.0|Bought a copy of the game, not able to pre-order so I bought the guide separately. Came with the map and all the info. you could possible need within the game. Great condition, great shipping, solid read.
B001VTTRC6|5.0|This movie covers so many issues related to human choices, pain, revenge, hate, love and loss.  I recommend it if you are connected to yourself.  It is thought provoking.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very excellent game. Recommend to everyone. Better than temple run and subway surfers<br />.TheProtein is my game circle please add
B0027MJU00|4.0|This book felt just like a roller coaster in my mind. So unexpected, chilling and disturbing. A great break from internet surfing!
B0091WFNEG|2.0|How do you turn the Battle of Gettysburg into something trivial?  Or laced with dorm room philosophy?  Or take over 4 hours to focus on just two and half aspects of this battle?  Or have stilted dialog and banal music distract from the events?  Answer -- Make this movie.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I bought the book with great expectations but it was one big disappointment. I was not even able to finish the book because it was so boring.<br /><br />There was no continuity in the book, which made it very dull to read.
0316247545|5.0|really enjoy this book, very fun to read and have a better understanding of the pony world.  Great for all Ages
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app does nothing but takes up space its just their I still don't know how is supposed to work according to the designers.
B0033AX20E|4.0|Considering im an impatient person when it comes to ordering things the cd came in a timely fashion , cd was not damaged  neither was the dvd only reason i give this a 4 instead of 5 star is because the case had a small but noticeble crack<br /><br />o well it add character i geuss lol
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Probably the best action movie I've ever seen.  Very happy I bought it.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|We had a movie night recently and we picked Rio. My kids love the song from the movie and have heard it on Pandora countless times. So when I suggested it I amazingly got all Yesses!!!! Even better, we all enjoyed it. My 6 year old laughed histerically on multiple occasions and it was a cute story.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I rented this based on a comment from a friend who said it was quite scary. I must say that I did get startled more than  once and it remained to haunt me the next day.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|As good as the first time I read it. Lucy and fast-moving prose with a story that pulls you in.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i just downloaded this game and i am already addicted. if you love the movies you've got to try it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The well-known Temple Run apps have now met their match. This app is where you are running from a police officer and his dog. There are three lanes to switch from, and coins to collect. It is better than temple run because you can run on top of the trains and earn score bonuses. Not only are there powerups, but you can collect Mystery Boxes. Mystery Boxes hold objects used to unlock characters, or sometimes they hold money or upgrades. Sometimes there is a theme, currently it is Paris.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I thought it was the most exciting beach racing app I've played... need cars that can drive on water as well as faster normal cars
B0036EH3UC|5.0|This complete series was exactly what my husband, who is a Battle Star Galactica junkie, has been wanting all in cool packaging.
B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|This critical edition is astounding in it's clarity of Bellini's vision: the cast is superb, as is the orchestra and conductor.  MAKE THIS THE ONLY VERSION FOR LIVE PERFORMANCE!!!!!
B002RWKSII|4.0|BRIAN DOES AN AWESOME JOB ON THIS CD. IF YOU LOVE THE BEACH BOYS AND BRIAN WLSON YOU MUST OWN THIS.
0321543726|5.0|I got the book in a reasonable time and the quality was excellent.  I had no problems with this purchase at all.  Nothing much else to say.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I enjoy many apps from this developer, but this is by far my favorite! You get to do the makeup and dress up a princess. I do wish you could dye the hair more colors, or have more dress options, but I love it anyway. I purchased the full version, and it is worth it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game ok get it now on your kindle or your xbox 360 it's awesome greenery I will save this game on my kindle
B000056BOR|4.0|Bad watching the movie due to the aspect ratio.  The picture as so difficult to see as it was very blurry, I got a headache from trying to continue watching it as I love it so .such .  I returned it so that I could get the blue ray version coming out in hope that it will, hopefully,be spectacular.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|The movie I have seen before and had to own. It's a special edition where you can see all the stuff behind the scenes which just makes it better
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|If you like horror movies rent it but don't buy it's not worth it. Just a lot of blood and gore with a subpar story line and acting was not great at the beginning but got better as it went on.
B009PNQUXO|4.0|THERE ARE QUITE A FEW HEADLINES THAT I READ THAT WAS INTERESTING.  HAD I NOT HAD &#34;TUBE&#34; I WOULD NOT HAVE BOTHERED TO READ THIS INFORMATION, OR LOOK IT UP FOR THAT MATTER.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A fun, uncomplicated game. I highly recommend. Could use a few more horse options, but it was free so no complaints.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|It seemed like there was a lot of buzz about this book when it first came out, so I put in on my list.  Once I finally got to it, I was seriously disappointed.<br /><br />The premise is fairly engaging, but the way the characters go about solving their problem leaves much to be desired. Most of the book reads like San Francisco propaganda with silicon valley name-dropping at every opportunity. Entire chapters come off as dedicated \\"odes to Google\\", even though many of the technical details presented are implausible at best and wholly nonsensical at worst. The dialogue can be punchy and fun, but is at times immature and reminiscent of young adult novels.  Even so, I found the story compelling enough to finish the book, though the resolution of the plot left much to be desired.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book will touch your heart and make you feel like your living right along with the characters. I really appreciated the positive portrayal of mental illness and the ability to treat it.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|The best processor in the economical range that a heavy gamer can lay hands on. Awesome performance. Couple it with an 8 GB RAM and a power supply of 650 Watts or more and you are good to go!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game reminds me a lot of DK 64 When they run the mine carts. Lots of fun. Quite challenging too.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I CAN'T FINE ANY INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PLAY THE GAME. AFTER SEVERAL TRIES, I JUST GAVE UP, MAYBE THERE COULD BE INSTRUCTIONS ADDED, &#34;YA THINK&#34;
B0045WKIRO|5.0|This album is amazing. It was so radically different to what I was exposed to at the time.  It's hype did not let me down.
B008Y79IUE|3.0|It was ok, but I didn't really get it. I think there were underlying themes that I didn't understand. The basic plot is simple though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game, I just got it to work on my tablets but now I can't put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me is my favorite movie, and the minions are super cute! This game is super silly and fun- I am so glad that it was made!
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I had to sleep with the lights on!  Make sure you watch after all of the credits, but you have to know the originals.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book, not sure at first but it kept me interested until the end. So I recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app was so fun to play and it's just like you are playing with a real horse. You should really get this app!
B00DU74U74|4.0|I had read the book so I was interested to see how they would show the 2 girls in one body. I was pleasantly surprised!
140006922X|5.0|I found myself really interested in what this man, born in Iran but exiled to the United States with the overthrow of the shah, had to say about Jesus of Nazareth on \\"Fresh Air\\" with Terry Gross. A man born a Muslim and now an expert on Jesus--but not Jesus Christ (although I think he is also a bit of an expert there too) but on the historical Jesus, Jesus of Nazareth.<br />My family of origins paraded us to church on Sundays, my mother in one of her collection of hats common in the 50s, my father attired in his Sunday best. But the experience was so uninspiring to me although I did enjoy belting out some of the hymns with words that held little if any meaning. And from there I have drifted into Unitarianism although I haven't attended any church in years. But at my age--I just turned 72--one does want to hope that there really isn't a fire-and-brimstone hell awaiting one after death.<br />In my family now is a daughter who is very religious--she has a master's degree in theology--and her husband, the minister in the church outside Philadelphia. On Christmas Eve I attend that church, singing (I am so bad at it) the old familiar carols. And listening to how Jesus is the messiah, believing none of it. So when Reza Aslan spoke for an hour with Terry Gross, when he demonstrated just how knowledgeable he is about this specific Jesus--not the Christ one but the historical one--I had to order the book. And glad I am that I did.<br />Although there are extensive notes at the end of the book, the book itself is very lay-person readable with short chapters and written in a nice prose style. In other words, this appears not to have been written for academics--I see a couple of academics have written reviews. As a person who will never believe that Jesus was really God, I have much more interest in the person of Jesus because he really is an inspiration, a \\"role model\\" of what a truly good human being can be. And that is exactly what the author presents in this book.  It becomes very obvious that the author is a scholar, that he knows the material--and that he can present it so the person without a sophisticated biblical background can not only understand but come to appreciate Jesus of Nazareth. But if you are going to read this to confirm your sense that Jesus was \\"the\\" Messiah, then that won't happen because this account is based upon actual history. And that's why I really liked reading it.<br />And it is so easy to follow.

B0050DZN4K|5.0|I've tried numerous feeders, and this one is the best. Very visually appealing, the layout and design is logical, super easy to share stories.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app is bad. I tried to watch a pikachu vid and it blacked out. Don't get! It's sucks donkey!!! I also had to restart my kindle also. And it messed it upuntil I deleted it.
B00CU8OVIM|3.0|this album is ok. yo uhave to really be a J. Cole fan to appreciate it. I am not that into his stuff. he has talent and is decent. not my swag.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I had heard that the book was much better than the movie, so I avoided the movie and bought the book instead. I loved the style in which it was written: short-story first-person style interviews from a range of characters across the world telling their experiences throughout the &#34;Zombie War&#34;. If you like zombie stories (movies, games, books) at all, this is a must read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Me and my kid loves this game!!!  5 Stars :)  :)  Everyone needs to download this app.  The best one I have downloaded in a long time.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Yolo  so u should get this game because it's another way to be social and the game is beast mode
B009FZFONO|5.0|Didn't think anything could get better than breaking bad, nor did I think I'd ever be hooked to a show premised on a zombie apocalypse...and then I watched the Walking Dead.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Well i went down another star because it is starting to become very irritable that the update for amazon did not release yet and its going on a month since mojang released the update. AMAZON AND MOJANG DONT CARE ABOUT US FAITHFUL CUSTOMERS!
B002QCD2QO|3.0|The sound quality is terrible and it is very hard to make out what is being said. the picture quality was also poor.
B00448SE4S|4.0|My husband and I had been trying to watch this movie for a long time but could never find it.... and when we finally bought it on blu-ray, the blu-ray didn't even work. Finally we tried renting it from Amazon. Great movie. I loved all the video game sound effects and comic style pop-ups.
B000002J09|5.0|I bought the CD for :Stairway to heaven&#34; and the rest of the songs are great too. Brings back a lot of good memdories.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love everything the graphics the puzzles it's mind boggling trust me the story plot is great and has a cool twist.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Every once in awhile  you come across a book with a story rich , like a great<br /> dessert. This was  such a story for me . These children went through so much<br />  it shaped the people that they became.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|After such a long time (20 years I think? I've lost count.) It seems a bit of an anti climax, still the writting style is interesting and it's good to finally have an ending to a series that the original author lost control of about 6 or 7 books ago.<br />I'd highly recommend that anyone who's happy with the endings they've imagined over the years skip this book altogether but if you're like me and can't stop halfway then you should definately read this. After all the last battle is what we've all been waiting to read about for half our lives.
0979019710|4.0|Great book<br />Really surprised me since I am not usually engaged by the &#34;hype&#34; of self development in an American way. But but but.<br />This one is bringing all my interests and intentions together and bringing me to action. Getting out of bd at 5.30qm is easy. Doing something meaningful is hard. This has focused me. Thank you.<br />Lesson learnt: when you are randy it comes together. Do not push it or do not relax with it.
B00846TRHY|5.0|Great story, especially since it is based on a true story.  Success, rehabilitation, conviction and lost of action make this a great story!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I haven't watched it yet because season 3 isn't here yet. I hope I don't get too upset about how seasons 3 and 4 were written??
B00DHNAQ2Y|4.0|I really wanted to watch this movie I couldn't wait for it to come to red box so I ordered it. It had me super scared, if you want a good scary movie night this movie would do it :)
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is so fun! Its an app for anyone who likes game apps. Even if you don't know how to play,it teaches you. I totally recommended this game for everyone. I'm not even know card game player and I play this everyday. There aren't any other FREE Uno apps out there,so this was worth a download.

B005J3IEZQ|3.0|I think it is well written but the use of swear words really detract from it which is a real pity.

B00DGNO3WE|4.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise. I found it heartwarming, hilarious, and well acted. Having recently retired myself, it is certainly a story I can relate to.
B008602KQI|4.0|I thought this movie had a great story and excellent performances.Love can be really confounding as the the things you need are taken care of; Love and loyalty follow.As life changes, needs change and this was well portrayed.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|Need log to amazon app to work. Just to test it i had to enter several times the password of Amazon Market (and it is a very long password).

B0009XNUK0|5.0|Well here in the U.S. of A. people only think what the mainstream media tell them so when someone is found &#34;not guilty&#34; in the court of law after CNN and NBC and such folk demonize them for so long (a decade for Michael Jackson) the public don't understand and think that the court system has failed them.  Of course they don't get all of the facts but what do CNN and NBC and the mainstream media care about pesky little details such as that?  Why should they be held responsible for anything that they say and do?  After all they have gotten away with making sure that the U.S. lose every single war for the past sixty years someone of Michael Jackson's stature won't mean a thing to the public.  Also when your own record company such as Sony actively sabatoges you as being a &#34;has been&#34; who does not sell any more or record great songs anymore there isn't much one can do.  &#34;Invincible&#34; only sold eight million copies worldwide and only debuted at number one in the U.S. and in thirteen countries so obviously Michael could not compete against anyone else in the industry.  Of course the public in the U.S. did not have to know about any of this as they were only told the U.S. sales which were only a million or so copies.  Therefore they got an entirely different picture of the story of what was really the situation.  So the public were not interested any more and were told to instead support artists such as Eminem.  Along with the fact that this (&#34;The Essential Michael Jackson&#34;) was the EIGHTH compilation (the first three were &#34;HIStory: Past, Present, And Future - BOOK I&#34;, &#34;Greatest Hits: HIStory - Volume I&#34;, and &#34;The Number Ones&#34;) and the fifth (the next four were &#34;The Very Best Of The Jacksons&#34;, &#34;The Essential Jacksons&#34;, &#34;The Jacksons' Story&#34;, and the career overview box set &#34;The Ultimate Collection&#34;) released during Michael's trial over the past two years there wasn't any reason for anyoneto care about an artist who did not &#34;sell like he use to&#34; so the industry and media decided for you that promotion was not needed.  SO once again this product &#34;only&#34; sold three million copies at the time (which meant six million sold worldwide because it is a two c.d. set) but it was not until forty-eight hours into Michael's death that the American public followed their marching orders from the mainstream media and decided, &#34;Oh!  He WAS pretty good and not so horrible after all!&#34;.  Wow!  Talk about bad luck for real huh?  All that success just a couple of days into your death and you can't benefit from it at all!  Neat, huh?  Of course the mainstream media don't have to bear any responsibility with that because it is not like you are going to do anything about it!  Bwaah, ha, ha, ha, ha!!!  So AFTER he died in the following year it sold another four million copies (which counted as eight million discs since it is a double c.d. set) and to this day it is the best selling compilation of the &#34;Essential...&#34; series Sony have been doing since around the turn of the century.  (Worldwide sales since the end of 2009 are of seven and half million copies which is a total of fifteen million discs sold.)  Also this compilation does NOT include all of the Jackson 5 hits, Jacksons hits, or solo hits as a child solo recording artist, and not even all of them for him as an adult solo recording artist.  It would take five discs to do that.  Equivalent to or more than anyone else with all due respect to Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Elton John, Mariah Carey, and The Beatles.  Of course no one will sell as well as Michael in the future at this point because the music industry is gone in comparison to what it was around the turn of the twentieth to twenty first centuries.  Industry does not exist very well when everyone has stolen your product through the internet.  BUT with that said and since no one cares these two discs are the most expansive compilation to date (not including the 2004 box set &#34;The Ultimate Collection&#34; which was a generic budget compilation that did not cover all of his hits or best of tracks either; and nor should have it) also not including &#34;The Collection&#34; which was a limited edition box set released in the U.K. containing five of his seven studio l.p.s as an adult solo recording artist or &#34;The Indispensible Collection&#34; which is only available at this point elsewhere as a digital download.  It should also be noted that this compilation is unique from all others (not including the &#34;King Of Pop&#34; 2008 compilation that had TWENTY SIX different tracklistings depending on which country it was released in; the U.S. did not get a version released because he was long considered by the mainstream media, and public as a &#34;has been&#34; who was no longer able to create and sell worthwhile product anymore) because it includes edits and remixes not available anywhere else.  The reason this compilation as well as others by other recording artists does not include all of the hits is so that the customer still has to purchase either more product such as one other song or many other products such as multiple songs or the l.p.s (albums) themselves.  I think that this is fine (great business) and fascinating as well.  There were many adult solo recordings that were hits that were not included in this set whether it was &#34;We Are The World&#34;, &#34;Stranger In Moscow&#34;, &#34;Give In To Me&#34;, &#34;History (remix)/Ghosts&#34;, &#34;Gone Too Soon&#34;, &#34;Why&#34;, &#34;Butterflies&#34;, &#34;Somebody's Watching Me&#34;, &#34;Liberian Girl&#34;, &#34;Scream&#34;, &#34;Blood On The Dance Floor&#34;, &#34;Cry&#34;, &#34;They Don't Care About Us&#34;, &#34;Girlfriend&#34;, &#34;Earth Song&#34;, &#34;Childhood&#34;, &#34;Ease On Down The Road&#34;, and &#34;Jam&#34;.  (Yes the &#34;3.0&#34; version of this compilation had some of these tracks but that is now out of print,rare, did not get fully distributed, and did not contain a full running time third disc as it only had seven regular running length tracks on it.)  ...and since no one can count, pays attention to details, or cares about me acknowledging this at all this release actually has THIRTY-EIGHT tracks on it even though the sticker on the front of it when you get it says thirty-seven tracks are on it and other reviewers have expressed that as being the total as well.  We will just keep this as secret between you and me.  O.k.?
B000SUKPKM|4.0|I have loved the Goo since I was very young, and this CD hits all their 'hits.'  Very happy with it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|My friend has this game and loved it. So I got it and it was okay. If you want an awesome game get Discovery or survivalcraft. If I made this game I would make it $2. DON'T WAIST $7 ON THIS GAME.
0451196716|4.0|This is a typical King book though I didn't think it had quite the ending that I would have preferred but more like his style.  You can't help but get involved in the characters predicament and hope for a better outcome though you know it will be what it will be.  Enjoyable King book!

B009GEEMLY|5.0|This movie has good action and adventure in it. If you like the Marvel comics characters then you will love this movie. It does have some lines that reference other movies from the different characters. Must see.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD.  I like it a lot more than his earlier music, but I'm not quite sure why.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another great book by Khaled Hosseini.  He is such a beautiful writer.  Love the way he weaves the story and characters.  Perfect book for summer reading.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love it. I play it every day. Works great on my Droid phone - I do wish it the tiles were a bit bigger.

B005F2BBLK|5.0|Kids loved this movie. It is good fun for the whole family. Very cute adventure for Rango. Definitely a movie that you will watch more than once for family night. Must see.
B0046B6X1E|4.0|this is a thought provoking story not just a slasher film. it shows what can happen when someone in bullied.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an amazing read. It had me laughing and crying and going through the emotional journey with the characters. And I gotta say I adore Holder, what an amazingly complex and lovable character!
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|I was waiting for this CD to drop for a while. The track Safe and Sound is great and I wanted to see how the rest of the work was going to come out. Well, I'm betting that they will have multiple singles from this. Good buy.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Entertaining writing style.  His assessment of today's new norm is right on.  In order to succeed today you must be ready to do it yourself.  The days of, it takes a village are gone.  Our stupid politicians have not yet seen this.  EVERYONE should read this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I Love it! It is very very very addictive. I would recommend it to every one. I love this game.
B00B8PRDHE|4.0|Great concert, but I liked the all stars a lot better than I liked Ringo and I am a huge Beatles fan.  He just sounded a little off.  Everyone else was great.  Loved the Santana and  Toto stuff.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The only thing is there were a couple times I was completely stumped and I wish there would be hints. I made it through but it took longer with more frustration
B0026NWBY2|5.0|Anyone who argues that George was lesser than Paul and John are simply ignorant. While George may not have focused as much of his life to his music career, he was undoubtedly equally prolific to John Lennon and could write and perform just as magically as either of his compadres. This collection is but a small testament to the talent of one George Harrison... a man who could let his music speak for him more eloquently than anyone before or since.<br /><br />Do note: While I was a bit of a George Harrison fan due to his BEATLES hits and a few known solo songs, it was not until I saw a DVD of his appearance on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE promoting 33 and 1/3 did I truly stand and take notice of his increadible talent. This cd will remind the casual fan that he was so much more than a handful of hit songs... he was a true musical artist whose studio albums through and through held equally majestically as those of his former bandmates, if not superior. Thus, there are far more wonderful songs from this stellar musician than just his singles. There isn't a bad song on this set, yet it could easily have been a double CD release with all of his greatest works.<br /><br />I can only wish that George and Paul could have collaborated during their best years.
1250012570|5.0|What a beautiful love story.  Kept me mesmerised all the way to the end. A gorgeous story about life and a great read for the young all the way to the old. I loved it and will recommend to others (especially my clients - I am a psychologist). Very poignant and felt real all the way to the last page.  I have found a new author to read.  I also just completed her second book \\"Attachments\\" and this was equally as enjoyable. I want more (this is what happens when you switch from real books to e-books......you cant wait!!)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It is very fun and it doesn't glitch like some of the games out there. I love it
B00092ZMDY|5.0|As far as I'm concerned The Eagles can do no wrong musically.  Bought the History DVD also so in real life  they can do a lot of wrong.  Hope to go see them soon in Tulsa.  Wish they would  let  Randy Meisner perform with them.Think they are being a little tacky not to.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Everyone knows the film, but 3D really enhances the viewing experience. Really well done. Highly recommended put it on your 3D wish list!
B00AKOB7CG|2.0|This loaded great the first several times, but now it constantly gets &quot;stuck&quot; and doesn't load the workout....exceedingly frustrating!<br />The other fitness app I loaded doesn't work well, either, so maybe it's just too much for the Kindle to handle.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I just got this reader and am disappointed. while the app works and I can read and write files, watching  movies results in lots of buffering, stops, and lock ups. I'll be contacting Kingston as perhaps it's a bum unit. till then can not recommend.<br /><br />UPDATE:Kingston recommended a reset (TINY pin hole next to on/off) which did not help. i ordered a 2nd unit and this one works flawlessly. paired with a WD 1TB portable drive, an SD card, and a Limeade 18K battery i'm good to go.
B005K17RU0|3.0|It wasn't major,  trivial. even.  they had a line devoted. to times of sunsets and sunrises.  They decided they needed more ad space. The ad covered the alminac stuff.  I found that strangely irritanting. I looked for other apps that had that. no one did. Then I decided I was being silly. I picked the best of all the apps I tried, deleted weather channel. I 'll get the alminac stuff off the Internet. Hope you make tons of money off the increases .015 inches of ad space weather channel.

B008AIGWVA|5.0|What a fun interactive app for all to enjoy!  It is very easy  to use  and Ben is too cute!
B000LC55F2|5.0|This is one of the better movies. well scripted, great cast, great acting. And all done without a lot of senseless violence or foul language
0312427573|5.0|It's very famous for a reason. If you're a fan of Tom Wolfe you'll love it. He has great characters and juggles various story lines without being confusing. It's definitely a dark comedy or a tragedy depending on your preference.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|It's a good satire, filled with a lot hidden yet obvious humor.  It is also filled with contradiction, yet, in the end, they all end up.........Well watch the movie and you'll see.  The movie is wonderfully delightful and hilarious.  If you like watching the same movie, from time to time, you'll like this one because you'll always catch something that you didn't catch before.  This movie is a great addition to anyone's collection, it's a movie that keeps on giving.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Better than the tv series.  Characters are fully developed and fascinating.  Can't wait to start book two in the series.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|Edward Norton is perfect for this role. Excellent movie that the whole family can enjoy Another example to show that you don't need senseless gore and language to make a good movie
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|By Bill Marsano, award-winning travel and wine writer. Kipling was and is despised for his backward, imperialistic attitudes, but all that political correctness obscures his greatness as a writer and storyteller; his prose flows like pure water. This book is mostly filled with tales of Mowgli, a orhpaned human child raised by wolves in the jungles of India, who struggles to survive and to become a leader of his own pack. Adventures galore ensue; these are what used to be called 'ripping yarns' and 'rattling good reads', with enemies defeated and good triumphant. Remember that recent book 'The Dangerous Book for Boys'? Well the Jungle Book is for that audience.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Perfect three season series...all three which were  excellent.  Very good!  A+ Only the BBC seems to be able to do this well.
B00005JLCI|5.0|the best film version of hamlet ever made by far. it is the entire play so be prepared for it to take a while. it's somewhere in the 4 hour range start to finish. easy to follow and engagingly entertaining in the spirit i believe the author intended it to be. you won't find a better version of hamlet anywhere.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I may be the last of the fans...late getting into it.  Absolutely in love with this series and hope it continues for many seasons!!
0062280228|5.0|As always, Neil drops us into a colorful world full of magic and mystery.  The world that we, as children, imagined was around us; bursting with excitement even though danger was lurking in the shadows.<br /><br />While not long and complex as American Gods, The Ocean at the End of the Lane provides a unique story of how the metaphysical world could hide in plain sight.  It is left open to interpretation in so many ways that it would also make a great discussion book for groups that enjoy mythology, culture, spirituality, and/or psychology.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really Enjoyed This App, Keeps you Thinking, HOPE TO SEE MORE OF THIS,  dont want to put it down, lovedxit
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Loved it. A good movie that we can watch with our daughter and not want to plug my ears and gouge my eyes. Colorful, funny entertaining and sweet!
B00CTXBO9M|3.0|13 yr old son says it is fun, but you can only get high scores.  He says &#34;it's not like an adventure where you have to beat the game&#34;, so I guess that disappointed him some.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Quick shipping. Great movie, nice price. I'm starting a movie collection and this is a great one to have. Ordered a new one and it plays great.
193700788X|3.0|I was hoping for a more spectacular ending.  It was disappointing but a quick read. Not as action-packed as some of the other novels. Wishing I knew the rest of the story.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Now that there is a app for Facebook is amazing . I was not a big fan of getting on my computer and checking Facebook .
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|The Disney flagship that started all on a great Blu-ray which is packed with tons of animation history and cartoons that is a must for any animation professional.
1932907009|5.0|I'm taking a series of screenwriting courses and my teacher suggest we read this book. I would say you must read this book. That is if you want to write loglines, a beat sheet, and write a screenplay with structure... read this book.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game.  I got started because a friend introduced it and am enjoying breeding the dragons and guessing what the new one will be.  going to other islands to see what dragons they have is cool and trying to figure out if you could breed one yourself.  highly recommend it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel for Android is a helpful app to know how it is outside and also to see how it is where your friends, family, etc. is !  Is great for a hot day to see if you can go outside and for the cold days too.

B0063GORYU|5.0|It's a classic classic game. I enjoy this one and it has the options that I want without unnecessary extras.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I have bee using this app for almost 8 months, and I just recently did your update.  I really liked the old version better!  I wish I could switch back to it! I also have the app on my android phone and like the version I have on there.  My recommendation to everyone is if you haven't updated on your Kindle fire yet, DON'T!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love using this app with my kindle in church so much easier than flipping pages and great that you can change versions. I grew up in an old fashioned church where King James text was used but our current church uses NIV. So I switch versions to read both.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is the best game ever. This game is fun, challenging and addictive. So I think you should get this game because if you are bored start playing this game!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It's an a amazing game but needs an update for the fire to play with other people! It's one of the best apps I have ever played it's well worth getting and won't waste your time at all
B006LSZECO|3.0|Nothing redemptive about this story.  But an entertaining page-turner that is frighteningly relatable for this married lady!  Amy wins while I wonder what lengths I would go to for the last word.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Haven't taken it anywhere yet - only packed it up. It is big and holds a lot of stuff. The computer, a big Dell 17.3 inch laptop fits nice and snug - just right. It stands up when not packed because of a fold down flap in the bottom of the big compartment. Then lots of room for papers and folders and pencils and pens and USB cables and HDMI cables and books and clothes and slides (footwear) and phones and the phone charger and tablets and the tablet charger and misc. Whew, hope I can carry it.
B0084ANCBC|5.0|'Vanity Fair' by William Makepeace Thackery is a good, though long read, that covers years of the lives of the people involved. Sometimes the plot seems to drag but it is still hard to lay the book away for any long period of time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very creative. I was thrilled with this app because it is very fun and you can do whatever you want. LOVE It. I highly recommend this app. Thanks!<br />Upgrades are even better.
0385342071|5.0|Things can't get any worse for Poppy or Sam they do. However this book will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and swoon (if you like British guys)! One of my personal top 10 books for 2013! Easy to read, easy to fall head over heels for, hard to put down. A gem (Emerald maybe?) of book.<br /><br />I seriously have nothing negative to say about \\"I've Got Your Number\\", even the audio version is fantastic (with correct accents and all)!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Fascinating story and well written - twists and turns throughout as you get to know the characters better with every page. Not crazy about the ending but you decide.
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|I downloaded this the other day when Amazon had a free day. Used it a couple times, Works great with no wire attached and the phone is in the other room.
B008Q0D32S|3.0|did not like the early scene killing the young boy and his entire family on the ranch.  the opening train sequence was tense
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Man of Steel was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The graphics were amazing and the soundtrack exotic and fitting to the other world of Krypton. I liked the fact that this movie showed more information about Kal-El's (Clark Kent/ Superman)real family and planet as well as the genuine warmth and devotion of Clark's earthly family. Superman was portrayed as a mighty but humble hero in this beautiful film. Definitely on my top favorite film's list as a perfect combination of action, beauty, and emotion. I can't wait to buy this film as soon as it's released on DVD and Blueray!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Intimate tale for the kids that we are<br />and the kids that we used to be<br />and the kids that we will have<br />and will survive us when we are<br /><br />gone.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|App keeps telling me there's a new version available but the app store says I have the latest version. Will re-review when this oversight is resolved. Amazon has known issues with this with several apps... come on folks, get it together.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its absolutely perfect would play it all the time and the graphics are perfect. Amazing ive never interacted with a horse but now I can, and my kids enjoy it as much as I do and its absolutely wonderful.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|This Superman movie is a great reboot to the franchise, and definately fits more into the DC comics world.  Thank you to Christopher Nolan (Dark Knight trilogy) for making such a good story.  It was well done and acted.  I did find that the movie was action and CGI based, so don't expect the warm drama and comedy from the old movies.  But it stands on it's own, and was very enjoyable in the theater.  I just hope it stands up as well at home.  4.3/5 Stars.  ~Keep On
0385737955|2.0|I had heard many great things about this book, before picking it up. However it failed to meet expectations.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The setting in this story is fascinating and mysterious.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /> I can't help but wonder with how mysterious the character's surroundings are and no good explanations from people who had been living there for large periods of time if the author put much thought into why they where there. It seemed like the characters where put into the situation just to tell the story and not have an actual reason.<br /><br />I cared more about the secondary characters then the main character. The main character lacked any voice of his own (unless you count being confused and angry). By the time the plot actually picked up (around chapter 15 by the way) I ended up putting it down. I didn't care if the main character lived or died.<br /><br />The metaphors in this book where nerve racking. I think it is safe to say not a single one was written in context. An example, \\"It was like seeing a carrot on a tomato plant.\\" I'm not sure what emotions the author was trying to convey with this. It was completely random, and unnecessary.<br /><br />Over all I gave the book 3 stars because; the setting was very interesting, and... well no I cant think of why else.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I liked the characters there was amazing putting. vectors drones I like it to death you should put the professed and kids as character's.
B0085A9J18|5.0|This movie is right up there with fight club. If you are a guy then it is your obligation as a male to watch this movie. The shooting, fighting is non-stop. It is a 90 min heart pumping adrenaline ride. That being said I have read a few of the negative reviews. My response is that this is a movie for guys so clearly the 90 yr old granny from la-la land would be disturbed by the violence. I watch alot of movies so I know a good action film when I see it. Cant wait for the sequel.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Nice point &amp; click adventure. Wish they had a few more mini games that were challenging but we'll worth it.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|The concept of the movie was great. Execution... not so much. We stopped watching after about an hour and a half. It became monotonous and parts of the dialogue were difficult to understand, which made the story hard to follow. I had higher hopes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game.  I Started and couldn't put it down! I hope I don't run out of levels before they create new ones!
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Some of the pieces, like the flower tops are indeed tiny but even my 2 1/2 year old grandson was able to build with them. HE and his 5 year old sister loved the set and it will add to the larger Pink Brick Box set she already has.  Well worth the money.
0375842209|5.0|Maybe once or twice in a generation comes along a novel of such searing power, written with such expert artistry, that a jaded 42-year-old former English scholar like myself wished to god it had been assigned reading back in high school or college English classes.<br /><br />  How many millions of us, as teenagers, slogged through \\"The Magus,\\" \\"Catch-22,\\" \\"Diary of Anne Frank,\\" \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" or the combined works of Ray Bradbury or Kurt Vonnegut? Yes, they were great works of art, and they affected us deeply, giving us different viewpoints of War: torture, barbarism, senselessness, the sometimes mundane life of a soldier, the tension of hiding from the aggressors, even some sick humor...but we were MADE to read them, and that perhaps dimmed their shine a little.<br /><br />  This illustrious novel by Zusack, \\"The Book Thief,\\" about a young girl whose parents we assume are sent away to Nazi death camps while she is taken in by a foster family in Munich, is unique in that it is told in first person narration by Death, the Grim Reaper. It is darkly comic and often leaves one chuckling at the antics of Liesl's foster parents, while the world around them crumbles and burns in war and genocide. The juxtaposition of the darkly comic with truly horrific and tragic makes for an astonishingly good read, one that I found impossible to put down.<br />  I even found my old high school english professor on Facebook (hadn't seen him in 25 years) and said, \\"You have GOT to read this. Every time I pick it up I think of you...\\"<br />  Awesome. Stunning. Totally unexpected. PLEASE read it.
B00933JL0A|3.0|I enjoy the game... BUT (there's always a but). It would be nice if the merchant bought more and the sheep and rabbits should also provide food.<br />I wouldn't mind bigger maps as well.<br />I have no other complaints and I would recommend it to any one.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|This book was slightly different from the first. I did not care for America's constant battle within herself with her back and forth attitude of whether she wants to stay or go, or whether she wants Aspen or Maxon. Her attitude is as if SHE is choosing Maxon (or not choosing him). Not the other way around. However, at the same time, that is what makes her character so special, in a sense. In this book, Maxon doesn't quite have the same character. While he is still nice to an extent, you do not find out his true character behind some of the things he says and does until close to the end of the novel. The Selection was extremely well written and truly a great story. And as much as I loved the first novel and found that The Elite lacked a bit, I still love the whole story. I don't think Cass could possibly have topped herself after The Selection. I cannot wait for the last book of the series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the show, can't believe they killed Matthew off!!!! He was the most decent person in that family and he had just had a son, he was changing Mary for the better.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I loved the game but when the new update in it would not let me play.  But I like how it went down on price good game
B004SDEP38|1.0|Would not open,after download so tryed download from document site still no joy so it  is up to you good luck
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This was an interesting account but lacked a Christian perspective. Not a belief system that I would endorse. Well written. Heaven is for real by Todd burpi was much better.
B000HSIEPI|1.0|if only I had been able to watch the video stream on my computer. I do not have a problem watching other streaming videos online, but amazon always has problems. It takes forever to load and then stops so often to buffer that my viewing experience becomes unpleasant. So, I always give up because I do not want to spend 2.5 hours watching a 1 hour video. This also is one of the reasons that I have not purchased any streaming videos from amazon. Too much trouble to see the program . . .  If only my experience had been different, I could have actually reviewed the video.
B002NJWHHA|3.0|My 12 year old son read and loved the Eragon book. Then he begged to see the movie. It started along the same story line then things started to fall apart towards the middle and end. But, he still liked the movie anyway.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|This movie turned out better than I had anticipated. It had great dialogues and, while the comparison might not be appropriate, it actually had some of the elements that I would have love to see in the twilight movies: namely the acerbic wit of the main characters. It has a lot less teenage angst to have to put up with.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this app. It always works and I can go back to the games anytime. It shows well on the Kindle HD. Enjoy!
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I am, however, a fan of good acting, believable characters, and bottomless CGI budgets. And strong, cute women like that buzz-cut Israeli soldier. Oh, it had its weak spots, but pretty much the ones you'd expect of any zombie movie. And I don't think any modern lab dealing in BSL3 agents would take such a casual approach to their storge and access. And ... well, even Shakespeare requires some suspension of disbelief on occasion, so I can't call that a dire flaw.<br /><br />I went in looking for some good summer entertainment and a spot in the air conditioning. I came out impressed by one of the better movies of the 2013 summer season.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B001FB4VXU|5.0|In The Panty Pi&ntilde;ata Polarization episode of Season Two of The Big Bang Theory, Penny, the attractive female from across the hall comes into Sheldon and Leonard's apartment interrupting a Klingon Boggle game they are playing with Howard and Raj.  Her cable out she grabs the remote to turn on America's Top Model. The scene shows Penny comfortable enough to come into the lives of these four as she pleases while engaging in knowing banter. \\"Did you pay your cable bill?\\" Howard asks. \\"You sound just like the phone company,\\" Penny replies. But as soon as the channel is changed Howard becomes immediately aroused verbally pointing out future wife's, while Raj and Leonard quietly gawk in the background leaving only Sheldon to play the game. Penny leaves the room as she becomes immediately aware of the aroused trio sitting around her.  It's clear these scientists didn't even know America's Top Model existed.<br /><br />In Season One of The Big Bang Theory the storyline revolved around two unique worlds coming together.  It was a great start to the series but left the writers with one question:  what happens after the collision?  In Season Two, The Big Bang Theory takes great pleasure in exploring the awkward new dynamic.<br /><br />Instead of falling into the trap of putting two appealing characters in a romantic relationship too soon (hello The Office) Season Two of The Big Bang Theory mines the comedic gold of holding back. While the season begins with Penny and Leonard on a date, it becomes painfully obvious these two just aren't capable of maintaining a romantic connection. And it turns out the fight to sustain a connection to each others' worlds is where the humor of The Big Bang Theory resides.<br /><br />No more is this apparent than when Penny asks Sheldon in the The Bad Fish Paradigm if Leonard had ever dated any \\"normal\\" girls (you know, ones who aren't geniuses). It starts the season on a high note making the viewer realize that Penny is just as in awe of the boys as the boys are in awe of her.  She is getting something from these geniuses. Sheldon's response highlights how Penny's expectation of Sheldon as her friend, something he wasn't even aware he was until this episode, puts the most proudly anti-social of the geeks into a situation he has no skill or experience in dealing with, keeping a secret.<br /><br />The shows best moments come when Penny and the boys squirm through their new dynamic trying to figure out how to deal with this unexpected element.  Watch The Griffin Equivalency where Raj invites Penny to a People magazine party only to get drunk and become a huge jerk in the process. It is painfully, and hilariously apparent Raj just doesn't know what to do with a pretty girl. On the flip side is The Barbarian Sublimation where Penny is introduced to the online game Age of Conan by Sheldon and becomes a complete gaming addict leading Sheldon to say that girl needs to get a life. It shows it is not just the boys who are thrown for a loop by Penny. But Penny is also trying to deal with being attracted to a geek culture she has no grasp of.<br /><br />When worlds collide there's an aftermath, for The Big Bang Theory this aftermath was a solid step forward in the evolution of the characters and their relationships. As figuring out how to deal with the new and unexpected can be just as funny as the new and unexpected.as the boys are in awe of her.  She is getting something from these geniuses.

B00A9X9VAI|5.0|It was great to see Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt working together in this movie. The acting was superb, the story was particularly good considering that it was a sci-fi movie... they manage to side-step some of the most common pitfalls of the genre.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone that like intelligent action movies.
030758836X|3.0|Let me just say the hype surrounding this book is way too much (in my opinion). I thought the book was okay. The first part of the book is hard to get into. I wanted to stop SO many times. I read other reviews which stated the same thing and then a friend of mine said the same thing. So I kept reading. The second part is when this book comes to life. And the ending is like WHAT!!!  Reader beware...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show has great drama and is one of my favorites. I can't wait to start the next season! The Dowager Countess is simply marvelous.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|I really really hate the ending. Can't say much more for spoiler protection. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|It was confusing and a little long winded. The makeup and art design were great, though. I have been told the book is better, there might be some truth to that.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Unlike the app on my phone this one works all the time. Many times I prefer to use this app instead. Happy Facebooking!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My roommate couldn't finish this book because she said it felt like Green was just trying to make her cry. While it's true I did cry while reading this in multiple spots, I never felt manipulated into crying. It was so wonderfully written. I'm not one to read &#34;teenage cancer stories&#34; - which is apparently a real genre, not just one discussed in this book - but The Fault in Our Stars is definitely more than that. It's a love story. It's a story of a family's struggles. It's the story of hope and perseverance. It's the story of disappointments both large and small. It's a story about needing a real ending.<br /><br />Be prepared to cry, for sure. But also be prepared to be shaken, to be happy, to get angry, to highlight almost every line for some nugget of wisdom.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After reading this book I am horrified that it is on the market and teenagers are able to read this garbage. To be honest, I have read .99 cent novels that are better than this. Moms and Dads, do not let your young daughters read this garbage
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Different and looks like a reformed transformer Movie .  Ok acting and maybe a keeper but will not be a classic . Good story line since we are sending signals to outer space only thing bad guys can tune in and then take over with their advanced weapons .
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Fantasticall Magicall Fanatacial and so cool! Abc easy as one two three, it was exciting, and mistical. Loved every minute of it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|First off, I'd just like to say that there is probably absolutely NO WHERE else that you could buy all eight movies at $45. It just doesn't happen.<br /><br />I love the books and the movies, but buying all the movies suits me better than buying all the books. I'm so glad I made this purchase!<br /><br />The DVDs come in a case that holds all of them, then that case slides into a slipcover.<br /><br />All the movies were widescreen (I saw a complaint on another review about a change in format, but all of mine were the same).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend! It would make a great gift for someone who doesn't need all the extra bonus features.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|We can't get enough of this movie. Downloaded on 3 kindled. The characters are great when you watched in HD.
B005LAIH2C|3.0|It was Ok a bit different . Had a lot of violence in it . So its not a kids DVD or a keeper or going to be a classic .
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My son and I own the video game AND the DVD - and I can say with confidence that the footage in this movie is NOT from the game cut scenes. Yes, it follows the story line and uses much of the same dialogue, but the movie has all been re-rendered and has multiple scenes not seen in the game. This is a must buy for fans of the game, fans of Batman, fans of Lego - and just plain fans of fun. Great movie to plop your little one down to watch.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had a love/hate relationship with this book...much like the main characters had with one another! At times I felt sympathy for the characters, at other times I thought they got what they deserved.  Sometimes I wanted to throw the book across the room, yet I kept picking it up to see what happened next. I gave the book 5 stars because for once I had NO idea how it would turn out...usually you can pretty well predict who will end up with whom, and who the guilty party is, etc.  Not with this one!

1476734941|5.0|I have tried many diets before.  My brother, who is a doctor, saw Michael Mosley on PBS.  He and his wife read the book and started losing weight.  He recommended it to me.  I thought &#34;another fad diet.&#34;  After reading the book, I started the diet.  The first couple of fast days were not much fun.  I was very hungry by the time I went to bed on those days.  Now it is pretty easy to fast, and I am beginning to see results.  I ordered one book.  Then I had to order another one because I gave away the first one away.  If a person is really interested in losing weight, this is the method to use.  Fast two days and eat normally on five days.  This is much easier then counting calories and feeling guilty if you go over the recommended calorie allowance.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is entertaining, awesome and fun!!! I've been playing it for some time now and have enjoyed playing it. If you like cooking games as well as decorating, you'll love this!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book. I just love Suzanne Collins. This is a wonderful read for any fan of young adult works.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Maybe Ok if you use apps .But Dept stores are tapping in to Wi-Fi signals on your smart phone as you walk by or walk in and browse and then data is used to send you coupons etc . Shut phone off in the store and to not use an app to check prices the stores are just as bad as NSA
B009NY43NY|4.0|Quick read and one of the better books from this series.  While the last two books almost made me turn away from reading this last one, I am glad I decided to read it. While an ending is sad, it was the ending needed to complete this series. Finally, it ends as it should have...with the man she should have been with since the beginning.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it it's fun and very well put together  and it's graphics are the best and this is from Connor Hess I also have diabetes
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I like sciencey things and I don't know a lot of science, so I can't say if any of it makes sense or not but I can suspend my disbelief just fine. :)  The ideas are fun and exciting and suspenseful.  But what I really love most about it is the humor between the characters, and the characters themselves.  I love the friendships that are shown to grow and blossom between the primary characters.  Walter is adorable and hilarious. We end up watching marathon sessions because we can't wait to see what happens next!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book is... wonderful. Awful. Beautiful. It made me cry in unexpected places. Like when he holds her hand for the first time I felt tears course down my cheeks even though I was smiling. The way Rainbow Rowell described that moment was simple and absolutely perfect. The whole book is filled with moments like that, moments that made me remember that awkward, blushing, too hot phase of my first kiss. I highly recommend this book if you're in the mood for sweet and filled with the angst of a complicated, first love.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Looking at food from the business side of it.  Watch very carefully just what you put inside your body.  Much more to food than it simply taste good.  I think that the next step would be to show how these &#34;foods&#34; do a number on your body.  How they destroy your system.  Keep us informed.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|The sound is the benchmark for 5.1 audio. You can get the SACD, or, you can get this for the blu ray, as a gift, for the DVDs, for the weird marbles inside, or the coasters, or a scarf, or some other goodies that really don't matter when your speakers make love to your eardrums.

B008JFURII|5.0|Here they are again, our favorite former black-ops CIA agents, still Retired and Extremely Dangerous, who must reunite and track down a portable nuclear device, invented by a man who has been held  for over 30 years in an institution for the criminally insane.<br /><br />If you saw the original \\"Red\\" you know that after all the wild events, Frank and Sarah became a couple. Now we get to see what happens AFTER the \\"happily ever after....\\" (It's hilarious!)<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Bruce Willis (\\"Red\\") Frank is in a domestic frenzy, deliriously heaping his shopping cart at Costco with countless household items.<br />  * John Malkovich (\\"Red\\") Marvin is horrified to see Frank in this condition. He will do anything...<br />  * Mary-Louise Parker (\\"Red\\") Sarah has an edge over Frank and Marvin: people LIKE her, but she can only watch Frank's new-found domesticity with a mixture of dismay and affection.<br />  * Helen Mirren (\\"Red\\") Victoria is in the middle of another \\"side job\\" when our friends contact her.<br />  * Byung-hun Lee (\\"G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra\\") Han Cho Bai has a contract to kill Frank.<br />  * Catherine Zeta-Jones (\\"Side Effects\\") Katja is a Russian operative who formerly worked for the KGB. She and Frank have a \\"history.\\"<br />  * Anthony Hopkins (\\"You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger\\") Bailey is our mad scientist.<br /><br />This PG-13 outing is another wild ride with our favorite foursome, maybe even wilder than the original: Our screening audience laughed all the way through.  Expect vehicular mayhem, endless gunfire and blowie uppie stuff, hardly any profanity, several interesting kisses but no sweaty bodies. Mirren makes a great Mary, Queen of Scots, Parker speaks lousy Russian, Malkovich is fetching in a Carmen Miranda chicka-chicka boom hat and Willis plays Willis flawlessly.<br /><br />Don't miss this one! I'll pre-order my DVD from Amazon as soon as it's allowed.

B00B3L7B4S|2.0|DRIVE ANGRY (2011) is a hellish comic book-style movie (aimed at adolescent boys of all ages) that includes a netherworld \\"hero\\" named John Milton (get it?), lingering images of ghastly head wounds, totally nude women (one catfighting on the street has enormous...charms), overloud hip-hop and headbanger music, and a variety of classic muscle machines (Dodge Charger, Buick Rivera, Chevelle SS, etc.).<br /><br />At times an endless car chase on back country roads and at others a lame attempt to gross out the viewer with splooshing gun and axe wounds, the story goes from one indignity to the next at a rapid pace. Dumbest moment has to be several thugs breaking in on a scowling Nick Cage while he's copulating with an unclothed blonde. They engage in a motel room shootout as a contortionate Cage never allows his coitus to be interruptus. When the enemies are all dead, Cage's \\"date\\" is left cringing in the corner in a state of near-dementia. Hahaha.<br /><br />Upon reflection, a healthy touch of insanity (or masochism) is what's needed to sit through this thng.<br /><br />To briefly describe DRIVE ANGRY's non-linear plot: after the leader of a devil-worshipping cult decapitates Cage's daughter and mounts her femur on the upper end of his walking stick, he steals the dead girl's newborn daughter. Cage, who's rotting in Hades for unspecified sins, escapes with a multi-barreled god-zapping rifle and goes on a quest to avenge his daughter's murder and get back his grandchild.<br /><br />The Grim Reaper, in the form of an elegantly-suited \\"Accountant,\\" follows him to Earth and hunts down Cage and a young girl he's convinced to help with the rescue. Dozens of cars, a chemical truck and an RV are wrecked, explosions abound, and there's hamburger on the highway as bad music pounds like a migraine. We wade through all this to reach the grand finale at at abandoned Louisiana prison, where the cult leader plans to sacrifice the child to Satan on the next full moon, a midnight ceremony that features a fiery pentagram, grimy whirling dervishes and the requisite naked chicks, 40 followers in all.

B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I don't think I've ever laughed out loud reading a book, but there were several times I busted out laughing. I always read before bed and one night I couldn't fall asleep because I kept thinking about the book and laughing. There were lots of jokes I didn't get. I'm sure that's Tina Fey's lack of comedic ability and not my stupidity. Yes, I'm sticking with that. I don't consider myself a prude, but it was too raunchy for my likes. I hate how comedians feel like they have to use bad language to be funny.
B003YT5TGE|5.0|If you have ever worked at a software or technology company, you live this movie every day. Heck, if you work in any sort of office environment, you live this movie every day.
0425263924|4.0|I really enjoyed this book as I do all of Sylvia's books. It kept me wanting to read more and more. It was so hard to put the book down. Gideon and Eva make a great couple and are so much in love. In reading the book its as tho you are right there, right in the middle of everything, laughing, crying, loving, getting angry and being frightened. It was all so real. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that I thought this was the last book of this series, not so. I didn't see anywhere that there would be another book coming after this one but as I got closer to the end I kept thinking it would all have to come together very quickly . There were too many loose ends to end the book like it was but guess what.............  without warning the book ends and leaves you hanging on way too many things. One or two loose ends are a lot but this was way more than that. and way too many to end the book with. I have no idea when the next book will be out  . but I will be watching for it. I usually don't buy a book until all the books in that series has been published and are available. Then I buy the series and can read then together Its easier to keep up with the story and follow the story line that way. Other than that I loved this book. I hope the next book will be available soon so I can find out what happens next in Gideon's, Eva's, and Carey's lives. Loved it!!!!!!! Just disappointed I have to wait no telling how long to finish this story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I put offf watching this for a long time thinnking it would be some &#34;stuffy&#34; English show. Couldnt be farther from the truth! This show has wonderful characters. It never disappoints
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I'll rate this higher when I don't have to log into Google and enter the security words to check if I'm a bot 50x (number is an estimate, I gave up before it let me in). This is a stupid way to update the app.
B00CS7ZIHI|4.0|When I heard 30 Seconds to Mars first on Guitar Hero I was shocked that I had never listened to them before (The Kill was the song, I think). I bought the Amazon MP3 special deal for the first two albums and loved them. Now on their fourth album, their sound continues to evolve and get more electronic, but the same good song writing is still there. If you are looking for an album of electronic flavored, alternative rock anthems then his album is for you. If you are looking for the old guitar-driven 30 Seconds to Mars then you might want to skip this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good for times when your bored. But sadly needs WiFi. Needs an update for free gems though. I love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My entire family plays this game. Lots of fun! Great animation. Cool missions to complete. You won't regret downloading this game.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack. this soundtrack is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of theme. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then I recommend you do
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Your role in this game is to build a plague that will wipe out the entire human population ...before a cure can be complete.<br /><br />I hesitated to buy this game because of the premise...you are trying to kill everyone vs. save everyone. But it had such high reviews that I decided to try it.  I wanted a game that I could sit down and PLAY vs. many of the app games I have where you can only play for a few minutes each day and then you have to wait for your lives, or coins or something to replenish.  This is a sit down and play until you win (or loose) type of game.  And once you start playing it is really fun and the goal switches from trying to win, to trying to beat your previous score and also unlock new types of plague.<br /><br />My only critique is that the game is not very visually stimulating.  You are basically looking at a world map the whole time.  Still....it is fun to watch the world go red.
0061124958|3.0|so I ordered this as a gift for my mom when it came in the mail it was opened which probably wasn't the sellers fault however it did start my aggravation with this transaction.... i had paid for a hardcover book so it will last longer for my mom and when it comes in it is a paperback its not a huge deal but when people pay extra no matter how little extra it is they need to get what they paid for please pay attention to what you are sending people
B0064X7FVE|2.0|this was my favorite weather app until the recent changes. please go back to the old format. I'm on a search for a new weather app.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I am extremely disappointed in this boom and thank god I didn't get the third book because I've read it only gets worse. Eva is pathetic and unrealistic. I get the whole being in love thing and having a sexy boyfriend but damn woman you seriously need to get checked out because no one is that horny allllllllllll the time! All he has to do is LOOK at you and you forget everything? Really? NO<br /><br />The first book was good, not great but I thought maybe the next two will live up to my expectations but no. Worse and unbearable. I'm curious as to what happens to them because they, yes they had tragic childhoods and my heart breaks for them, but I'm not reading THREE more books to find out.<br /><br />I've never written a bad review before because I love reading and at the least I am usually entertained by most books, but I was just reading this to get to the end.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money..
B0071MDA2U|4.0|I am not sure why this book is only .99  - it is the second in a distopian trilogy. I enjoyed the &#34;enhanced&#34; features and I appreciate how they are optional to experience ...if you want to watch the video then watch it...otherwise just keep reading.<br /><br />Great story.
B007YXXSQY|5.0|came in in good time and good condition and is a great book my only complaint is slight spine damage but thats to be expected from a used book and i only put it on here because amazon said i didnt have enough words... all in all i love it
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|The book is worth reading, but I predicted the end from the very beginning.  I did not like the repetition shown near the end of the book either.
B00ATPVA78|3.0|Hints were good, but difficult to figure out how to complete tasks, since inventory items didn't always work when they were supposed to.  Game done too quickly otherwise for $4.95 pricetag
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I enjoy reading YA, distopian fiction and this is a great example of that.  Great characters, great story, couldn't put it down.  I particularly enjoyed this since I am a native Mainer and this is where the book takes place.<br /><br />That said...when the editors went through this book they missed something.  This area of Portland is called &#34;THE Old Port&#34; not just &#34;Old Port&#34; - made me laugh every time I read it.  I noticed it was fixed in the third book :)<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend this book and I hope you enjoy it!
B001D09OAI|5.0|This is every Indian's fan dream.....I LOVE THIS MOVIE.....and watch the beginning......There's a red moon arising on the Cuyahoga River ..... every time I'm lonely for my home town.  One of the best fantasy baseball movies ever - right up there with Field of Dreams and The Natural.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|why put a cheat guide on here if we cant have the game on our kindles?  seriously this is crap!!!  dumbest thing ever!!!!!
0345525558|3.0|This book reminded me of a simple romance novel. I had a hard time getting through the first 160 pages and although the storyline did improve somewhat towards the end, the resolution was as predictable as the ending of a Pixar movie....
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thought this was great and Kindle Fire makes it easy to watch movies where and when you want to.  I missed this in the theaters so had to see it when I saw it show up on the Prime list.  It did not disappoint.
0743289692|5.0|If you were ever interested in the Islam faith or the cultural practices of several Arab countries, this is one way toward self education in those areas. Sadly, dialog is not part of the equation when it comes to a select group of the members of the Muslim believers and the writer, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, could be one of their victims someday. In contrast, in the western culture where arguments about religion go on and on, murder is not one of the condoned options of conflict resolution.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|If u put your finger anywhere near the bubble, it is released even if you don't want it released yet.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love seeing how the aristocrats lived in the early 1900s. The interaction of the servants & the Crowleys is quite entertaining. Can't wait for season 4.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Yep I am also a sucker for campy, musicals.  The A cappella music is also something that fit my mood at the time.  Simple story line, music throughout, boy meets girl, dumps girl, girl gets boy back kind of thing and of course there is the whole singing competition angle.  Could have done without a lot of the scenes but the music held me through it.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love using headphones like this when I'm working because they don't require that you pluck them out of your ears with your fingers (as with earbud earphones).  You just swipe your hand over the band and you can remove them from your ears.  When people are constantly wanting to talk to you, it's a lot easier to remove and replace.  My local Best Buy no longer carries them, so Amazon is the most convenient place to get them.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|Its ok but amazon needs to get candy crush saga game.  Why is it you can't get this game on the kindle fire
B00121QGUY|5.0|I chose this rating as it is exactly as described and well worth the money, I would recommend this to anyone that wanted one
B004WO774M|5.0|It is nice to learn all the filming process and all the people working in the industry. It worth the second disc
B003Y5H57E|5.0|This movie shows the imperfect forms of love that different type of relationships endure and the heartaches that go hand in hand with love. Steve Carell never disappoints and lets admit it, Ryan Gosling with out a shirt... need I say more?!!!
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Interesting. That's all j really can say about this book. Really opens the mind and really makes you think about love.
B001YV506S|5.0|I chose this rating as it is exactly as described and well worth the money, I would recommend this to anyone that wanted one
B000001ES9|4.0|This album is probably overlooked because Neil Peart does not play on it.  The fact is, it is better than much of their recent releases.  The song Working Man alone is worth the purchase.
B004OR199G|5.0|I loved the positive energy and humor that Kris Carr brings to the table. Her spirit is infectious. Great book!
1594204217|5.0|THIS IS POLLAN AT HIS BEST. He delves into the methods of food preparation and brings it all home. I Would highly recommend this to anyone interested in what they were eating.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved the first one and I love the second one. The graphics upgrade is astounding. For an app I think this particular game is just outrageously beautiful. I thoroughly enjoy the new mechanics, obstacles, and items. In my opinion they took a great game and made it better.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is addicting and I just can't stop. No complaints from me. It's fun to play with the kids and great for the family.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Aside from the beginning, the entire movie is pretty sad, but all worth it!  They captured the emotion and the Thai surroundings perfectly. Love both of these lead actors including the oldest son and the younger children are adorable.<br /><br />You wouldn't believe this could be based off of a true story. Bring a tissue box, it's definitely a tear jerker.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The book is gripping. YOu don't want to stop reading and the narrative is very dynamic. It is well-researched and very interesting. Sometimes some events are a bit too fictional. Overall: good reading.
0979019710|5.0|I love this book! Listened to his talk before reading the book, and the book really helped get my life on track! every time I read even a page of it, I feel motivated to do something with my life at the moment. I don't to live a mediocre life! I'm not going to live a mediocre life!!
B009PNQUXO|1.0|I didn't use it, didn't get it. it wasn't what I thought it was I guess. Why download things when you can just watch it on youtube in the first place? This is just my opinion though, you may love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app especially the fluffy unicorn people should get app . This app is so fun get it please
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I cannot find the words to describe, but this movie has soul and depth that the Marvel movies cannot touch.
B000W21ER4|5.0|It has so many awesome songs. It's really fun to sing along with on road trips and when you want to just veg out in your own little world.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|As the frontman of a metal band, I've had a solid Top 3 influences since I was a teen: Ronnie James Dio, Rob Halford, and Geoff Tate. I've bought, lost or wore out, and bought again more copies of Rage For Order than any other album, and have a very special place in my heart for that and Promised Land. That being said, the best Rÿche release in nearly about a decade is the Tate-less, Todd La Torre-fronted Queensrÿche. Now, I don't know all the details of the recent drama involving the previous lineup and frankly I don't care... I just want all parties involved to keep using their God-given talent to keep the RAWK flowin' and, unfortunately, nothing Tate has produced holds a candle to this AMAZING self-titled relaunch. My actual rating for this would be 4.5 stars, with the only drawback being the track length (or lack thereof) but hey... being in a band, myself, I get the concept of \\"leave them wanting more\\" -- which I certainly do and I hope we can open for these guys when they hit the Sunshine State. BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|I was a bit shocked by this book.  I have to admit that I had not read this book and I now have 4 kids.  So, I decided to read it to them.... BAD idea!  You need to read it first so that you can shield them from the bits of horror!  The Tin Man cut himself up!!!!  Did no one else read that part!?  I couldn't believe some of the graphic parts!  After that, I knew to alter the story when I would get to those parts, but some warning would have been nice!<br />And in case you didn't know, it is not like the move hardly at all!  Not a bad story, but definitely surprising to what I was expecting!!!
B00C3JU7D6|5.0|I can't say that they are going to be saving Rock and roll anytime soon. Maybe they are adding a little rock to the pop world. But great lyrics and guitar licks makes this a fun foot stomping listen.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|I had a really hard time getting this CD from stores they were either sold out or it was to pricey.  So I was happy when I found it on here for a great price.  It was packaged well and was brand new.  My daughter loves it and listens to it all the time.  So if you or you children love this group I would recommend getting it from here.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|just too short needs more knots and a little more versatillity.  theres not really very many knots or projects in the book.  You have to be pretty creative to combine any of these examples/methods into any projects.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Recently, on one of the \\"Premium\\" channels, I saw a another movie about Hitchcock set during the filming of \\"Birds.\\"  I can't remember what it was called, but it seemed to portray the Great Alfred as having a quite different personality that I just don't remember seeing during the TV series.<br /><br />This movie with Anthony Hopkins, seems more to be a truer characterization of the man I remember.  I loved \\"Lifeboat\\", and thought that film was his masterpiece, though I have watched \\"Birds\\" numerous times through the years.  This new video is set during the time of the filming of \\"Psycho\\", which of course is a horror masterpiece, so unlike what passes for \\"horror\\" at theatres today.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins plays the role, and he is an actor that can completely remove \\"himself\\" from a role to the point that you don't know who is playing the part without reading the credits!  A truly great actor.  The girl from \\"Iron Man\\" plays Janet Leigh, (Can't remember her name right now), along with a lady that played his wife entirely differently from the film on the Premium channel show I recently saw.<br /><br />But, the show kept me seated, and interested for it's entirety.  The plot was very interesting, and when the dramatic ending came, it was good!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I'm sad it ended I hope the author writes more because I'm obsessed with percy Jackson and the olympians series
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I downloaded the game and it did not want to work.<br />I tried again and it did not work. I tried10 more times and it still did not  work,I do not want this app on my kindle
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|I knew Agnetha was back, when, being so far away, in Montevideo, Uruguay, suddenly her voice came out of the speakers, in a bus while I was heading to work.<br />This CD is a gem I must tell you. There's no way to skip one song, or to pick up one of them, because all of them are sublime.<br />You'll be surprised: Agnetha's voice is richer and better than ever!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Well worth the money for my convenience. The Documents To Go mobile office suite gives me a fully functional piece of office software in my pocket. Its integration with Google documents has proven itself to be invaluable. I can't say enough about this.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this weather app., up to date and great maps..also gives you advisories on the current weather. would highly recommend this.!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I got this game for my fourteenth birthday yesterday . I play it so much that im already on level 8. There are zero glitches . And i dont need any wifi . Good for any ages but be careful younger kids might accidently purchase stuff with your real money
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is amazing i can upload pics and look at pics it is amazing i recommend this to teens or moms who take pics of moons and others!
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|It held my attention as does any thing having to do with OZ. Awesome looking scenery and computer generated flying monkeys.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|This is a fantastic game, but if you want to play any game mode besides standard, you must pay $9.99 That's a lot  of money for a game. But for paying, you'll be able to print out a voucher for an alternate art card and a six card booster pack. Worth it? Maybe. Other than that, this game is the best. If you don't want to earn the decks, you can buy them. The game took longer than 3 hours to download. That's too long. I highly recommend this app and the full game purchase, but I cannot rate it higher than three because I believe $9.99 is too much to pay.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|Hey action romance what can I say. this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat love it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This Game keeps me at the edge of my seat I Love it it keeps me going in the afternoon download it its fun!
1400062071|4.0|I have now read several of Strout's books and this may be the most 'down' of them but still liked it quite a bit. There are only a few characters (as is the case with Amy & Isabelle) and the depiction of Tyler Caskey, a minister, whose lively wife died not long before the narrative begins is sympathetic to his weaknesses and strengths. Tyler tries to apply the teachings of Bonhoeffer to his ministry and his life with rather mixed results.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of the best I have read.....it was recommended to me by family and I could not put it down while on vacation!

B008YF4BIU|5.0|I had read this book before but couldn't locate it. This book touched my heart so much I had bought a few copies about ten years ago for my friends as I was so inspired, I wanted them hopefully to see what I felt hoping they could get the message too. God loves you and never punishes anyone.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The series definitely takes a gripping turn for the worst in this season. If you enjoy tasteful tragedy and polite carnage this is the period piece for you.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|my son just now has begun to take an interest in this one.  before he would only play with games that he played on my phone.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|this in won of the best buys I've ever made in my life!!!! the is really the quality of the backpack I would not by any other backpack. this is well worth the price I've had it for over a year now and it is still in perfect condition!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was amazing. I thought it was very funny.<br />One of the best Diary of a Wimpy Kids I`vv read so far
0345803485|1.0|This is arguably the worst book I have ever read--and I've read a lot of books. Think of this as a modern remake of Jane Eyre. You know, your typical female protagonist meets a brooding and mysterious male lead. The only difference is that...oh wait. These two works aren't even comparable.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I'm not a prude. I knew full well going in to this that it started as a erotic Twilight fan fiction, originally printed online before being snatched up by a publisher. I didn't have high expectations to start with. I thought it would just be a fun, easy read. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised. Surely, there's a reason it's a number one best seller with four stars on Amazon, right? Right?! But this book seriously let down, and that's saying a lot, considering my already exceedingly low expectations. Plot line is fine. Classic--nothing original. But the execution was beyond belief. I don't mean that in a good way either. Clunky, clunky prose. The editor was either non-existent or doodling on the job. How many times can you murmur? Do these people ever just speak at a normal volume? Ana \\"flushed\\" so much that I was concerned it was indicative of a heart health issue (plot twist? Alas, no), even taking into account her probable paleness as a result of lack of sun in the Pacific Northwest. And with the number of times Ana bites her lip, you start to wonder whether she has permanent gashes etched upon the surface now.<br /><br />And I know this is suppose to be chock full of sex, being an erotic novel and all. But come on. At least make it believable. Christian literally bangs her everyday, multiple times a day. How is Ana not in a wheelchair already from all that action? Also, an orgasm and a rocking BJ on the first try?  Teach me those skills, girl.<br /><br />The book ends in the worst way possible. One minute, they're having sex, and the next minute, she's like, \\"Oh no. Guess we're incompatible. Don't kiss, hug, or give me a handshake as I awkwardly walk out of your house without saying goodbye or else I'll get so turned on I'll drop everything I'm holding and crave to be between your arms (or legs) again.\\" I know it's a trilogy, so it's suppose to be somewhat of a cliffhanger to get me to want to read the next book. But seriously. The final page was dissatisfying to the point where I was tempted to throw my IPad out into the bay because I was so pissed off I got through all those 500 pages for nothing. I might have too if I was actually holding the book.<br /><br />All in all, I have to give it one star for getting me to wonder about their fate at the end. (Yes, I am aware you can't rate any lower than one star, so I'm trying to justify this single star). I wanted to know what would happen, and for a brief period of time, I was tempted to start the second book. But I was afraid anymore exposure to this writing would decrease my intellectual prowess, so I cheated and looked up the summaries.<br /><br />Worth the read if you are sitting with your mouth open, drooling, and staring into space because you have nothing better to do. But if you have even the slightest inclination to do something else, if you have the most mundane unimportant errand to take care of, save yourself. Just read the summaries if you are curious.
0812550706|5.0|This is one of the classic I would recommend to all of my friends. Can't wait for the movie that's coming out in a few months!
B00CNGA1PS|4.0|I've used three different podcast apps over the last 2 years and they all have something in common = resource hogs/ slow down my devices. This app is no different...but where this app excels is features. I love being able to speed up, or slow down, playback speed. I listen to tons of podcast and being able to speed things up is so helpful in getting through them all in the time I have to listen.<br /><br />My second favorite aspect of this app is the search feature. I have found all my favorite podcast and some new ones too. I don't watch video podcast but it is nice to know I have that option.<br /><br />I accidentally subscribed to an rss feed for a news website. It was cool to see I could use this app to do some reading too.<br /><br />If this app didn't make tablets laggy, I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />BTW, this app doesn't have the playback speed change on Kindle HD because it is not running Android 4.1 or higher.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Bubble blaze satisfies my bubble blitz craving. Until it becomes available for Kindle Fire HD. It seems like it's just for the kids at first. But as the levels climb it's more of a challenge. Great App for the price FREE did I mention it's FREE. Enjoy.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|wonderful acting. cop out ending.  15 more words required to post this review.  Shouldn't they be happy just getting one?
B00439MV42|5.0|I love this movie and the whole entire trilogy! I sure miss one of the best duo of all time.
B000002PCS|5.0|I love this show! it is one of my all time favorites!, i bought this soundtrack when i ran across it immediately!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Incredible story! I loved every page of it. It was like a Lifetime movie going on in my head!! READ IT!
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Love it!! Nice bittersweet story about the ties that bind in good and bad ways. Not overly romantic but well written and evocative.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|First of all, I'm a real Downton Abbey fan (even have the theme song as the ringtone on my phone) so when my husband offered to get me Seasons 1 & 2 as well as Season 3 as an anniversary gift, I agreed wholeheartedly.  The nice thing is that I can enjoy episodes over and over again whenever I want, my college age child has now watched all the episodes, and my husband and I are watching every episode of seasons 1-3 over again in preparation for Season 4.  We think Downton Abbey is a good period drama and has an interesting storyline.  If you are a fan of Downton Abbey, then I highly recommend having your own set of DVDs so you can enjoy watching episodes anytime and can use it to help bridge the time while waiting for season 4.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game on my fire. Loads quickly and if you like match 3 games...you must get this one!  Great game for downtime.
014050639X|5.0|I remember loving this book as a child, and enjoy sharing it now with my son. It is a wonderful, fairy tale version of &#34;Wheres Waldo&#34; for little people. :-)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What can I say, it's a 5 star winner.  Looking forward to next season and I'll buy Season 3 too.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Awesome app.. I love it! So dividable and best of all it was free! Grab it as soon as you can
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The book was really good. I'm just mad at how it ended. Can't wait until the next book comes out.
B00881VLCE|5.0|A recent  update wouldn't work on my 1st generation Kindle Fire and I complained to all who would listen(see**below). They promised a \\"fix\\" and they kept their word and even added several new features like a selection of backgrounds and a free daily mystery puzzle. Thank you to the developers and engineers who worked to make this again the best puzzle app ever! Most definitely  a 5++ once again.<br />**In my opinion, this version update is awful!! The pieces are so difficult to move out of the tray and position on the screen that it takes forever to just complete the puzzle's outside edges. The pieces often stick and refuse to move when I attempt to drag and position them with either my finger or a stylus. Hopefully, a fix is coming soon or they revert back to the previous version.<br />It is useless otherwise.
159420411X|3.0|I am a regular reader of Nate's Five Thirty-Eight blog and there was a lot that I liked in the book but I felt like I was overwhelmed with statistics jargon, which I probably should have expected. Also, there are a lot of footnotes which those of you who read on Kindles know is not that enjoyable to deal with. If you have more of an affinity for statistics then you will probably enjoy it more than I did.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Awesome app...I love it! So easy to use and with my note 2 It makes writing and editing apps easy to use
006178480X|4.0|The Eye of God by James Rollins- In Rome the head of Pontifical ancient studies receives a mysterious package; a book made of human skin and a skull, but they are not of just anyone but DNA testing has shown that they are the skin and skull of Genghis Khan.<br />In Washington D.C. the head of an elite groups is watching a very secret satellite crash somewhere in the Mongolian mountains.This satellite has traces of dark energy and before the crash it showed what seemed to be the destruction of the eastern sea board.<br /><br />How do all these events tie together?No one is sure but Gray and the Sigma Force team is sent both to track down the relics as well as retrieve or destroy information on from the crash site.<br />The clock is ticking as both an ancient foretelling and science come to one conclusion:the earth has 16 hours before it faces what could be it's total destruction.<br /><br />Fast paced page turner.Rollins once again blends History and Science along with a fantastic story line to keep us wanting to know what comes next. Be sure to research the facts on your own and learn more about the fascinating world we live in.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|Mma Ramotswe is the finest, and only, lady detective in Botswana. Despite her lack of experience, she has a natural gift at rooting out the truth. A refreshing, light-hearted story, I loved the authentic nature of the characters and the situations Mma Ramotswe finds herself in, including facing down a crocodile. Highly recommend it, especially to those who love mysteries, detective stories and African stories.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|The best part of Gaiman's work is that everything feels familiar, even when it becomes clear that not everything is normal. This story feels inevitable as it proceeds and part of you wants to stop because you know something bad is coming, but you can't stop.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The kids and I really enjoyed this.  Hearkens back to another favorite...Myst.  Difficulty increased with each new level.  Recommend this one for puzzle lovers.
B00A822VDY|4.0|Great movie that I can stand to watch with the kid. I wish it came with a digital download code.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I've used other PC remote access apps before, both open source as well as commercial, and this is by far the best for Android.  The experience is as close to being at my Windows 7 64-bit PC's keyboard as I can imagine, whether I'm on local network or 3G/4G.<br /><br />I got this on a free Amazon deal, but I would have paid for it.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I started watching because Tim Goodman put Orphan Black atop his Power Rankings. I continued watching because Tatiana Maslany is brilliant in multiple roles. If you didn't watch Orphan Black then you missed the best lead performance (and possibly support performance) by an actress on TV this year.
1472200314|3.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is set in a rural town, probably in the 20th century. Although there are lots of scenes that take place during daytime, there is a certain darkness that I felt spanning these scenes. This gave the setting quite a creepy atmosphere. Sometimes everything about the narrator's house seemed so shabby and rotten. I think this was brilliant.<br /><br />The main characters we meet in Ocean are the narrator (sometimes in the form of a grown up man, more often as a little boy) and his family, the narrator's friend Lettie and her family and then there is a woman called Ursula Monkton. All characters are very believable, some friendly, some scary, some a little blurry. The blurriness of these characters might be because they are of lesser importance to the story. But as we are experiencing the story through the little boy, I think his mother shouldn't be that blurry even though she only plays a minor role.<br /><br />The story itself is interesting and I'm still not that sure what to think of it. I don't know if Mr. Gaiman wants it to be interpreted or not. I'm not sure if it should simply stay a fantastic tale, or if there is supposed to be more depth to it. If there is, I think it's clever. (I can't tell much more without putting spoilers in here). If it's just a tale, I think it's a nice tale but it's not very special at all. It reads quickly, it's NOT for children, of that I'm sure, but it didn't surprise me. The Ocean at the End of the Lane a very dark and scary tale of a boy who is unfortunate enough to be involved in something he doesn't understand and fortunate enough to find good friends.
0920668372|5.0|this is one of the best children's book!  I give it as part of my gift for a baby shower
0670026557|5.0|I love how clearly this book is written.  It covers the principle assertions in a very readable manner in early chapters with plenty of anecdotes, before going into the empirical research and experiments that back the anecdotal observations and conclusions.

1936891026|4.0|I found The War of Art in a bookstore not long after it was published. I pulled it off the shelf, leafed through it, then put it back dissatisfied. Something about the author's style repelled me. It seemed too simplistic.<br /><br />I returned to the book about five years later after reading about it in Hillary Rettig's excellent career handbook [[ASIN:1590560906 The Lifelong Activist: How to Change the World Without Losing Your Way]]. On my second encounter with the book, I found it very helpful. The book's style may not appeal to everyone, nor at every phase of one's career path, but if you're reading this review (among the hundreds of other five-star reviews) I would suggest that you at least get your hands on it and take a look at it. The book's not perfect, but author Steven Pressfield has many hard-won good ideas about overcoming the mental obstacles to becoming a creative \\"professional.\\"<br /><br />While I love Pressfield's blunt description of what makes someone a \\"professional,\\" I think that his definition of \\"professionalism\\" in this book doesn't focus enough on the altruistic aspects of the professional ideal, as explained in books like Mike W. Martin's [[ASIN:0195133250 Meaningful Work: Rethinking Professional Ethics]], Michael Davis's [[ASIN:0754605507 Profession, Code, and Ethics]], Daryl Koehn's [[ASIN:0415116678 The Ground of Professional Ethics]], or John H. Kultgen's [[ASIN:0812212630 Ethics and Professionalism]]. (These books are very academic, but worth a look if you're serious about investigating what professionalism means.) In Pressfield's more recent book, [[ASIN:1936891034 Turning Pro: Tap Your Inner Power and Create Your Life's Work]], he focuses a little more on this altruistic aspect of the professional; for example: \\"The amateur is an egotist. He takes the material of his personal pain and uses it to draw attention to himself. He creates a 'life', a 'character', a 'personality'. The artist and the professional, on the other hand, have turned a corner in their minds. They have grown so bored with themselves and so sick of their petty bulls**t that they can manipulate those elements the way a HazMat technician handles weapons-grade plutonium. They manipulate them for the good of others.\\"<br /><br />The War of Art takes a mythical or folksy approach to mental obstacles and doesn't provide some of the more subtle analyses and techniques devised by psychologists. If you need more detailed help than Pressfield provides, I recommend looking at other books like Neil Fiore's [[ASIN:1585425524 The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play]] (a treasure trove of effective reverse-psychological techniques), Robert Kegan & Lisa Lahey's [[ASIN:1422117367 Immunity to Change: How to Overcome It and Unlock the Potential in Yourself and Your Organization]] (a smart system for overcoming what Pressfield calls \\"Resistance\\" at both the personal level and the group or organizational level), Kelly McGonigal's [[ASIN:1583334386 The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do To Get More of It]] (a practical introduction to willpower based on scientific research), and Jim Loehr & Tony Schwartz's [[ASIN:0743226755 The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal]] (a solid overview of the role of physical fitness in overcoming obstacles).ned a corner in their minds.

B00001QEE8|5.0|A great movie from my childhood.  I swear my dad is a human version of Balu, so that's an added bonus.  It's nice to have it on DVD now
193700788X|4.0|I just finished reading Dead Ever After and I have to say I enjoyed it much more than the book before it.  The Fae were irritating to me, as was the cluviel dor story line.  As other readers have pointed out, Sookie and Sam have been great friends since the beginning, and there were many events throughout the series that indicated that they were attracted to one another.  Eric manipulated Sookie at every opportunity.  From using her mind reading capabilities to get over on his enemies to tricking her into a vampire marriage ceremony, Eric was always about what's good for Eric.  It was who he was.  Some have lamented that Eric is bound to Freyda for 200 years.  That doesn't seem like such a long time when you think about how long he has been a vampire.  I enjoyed the series tremendously on the whole and I hope that Ms. Harris will someday write a book that catches us up on the characters at some point in the future.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I liked this book because there was a nice tension in the movement of the plot that kept me interested throughout the story.The mysterious element with the neighbour was a nice touch, whether or not you are spiritual, it worked well in the plot.The love story-line was mature and fitted the general tone.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I do not usually write reviews, but this product warrants one.  I bought two for a two week road trip and they both worked flawlessly for charging various iDevices (several iPhone 4s, a couple of iPads of different generations) and a Samsung Galaxy S3 quickly.  The real test was being able to charge the S3 with its GPS on, screen set to full brightness and searching for a cellular signal while out of range.  The S3 was able to charge from 60% to 100% and stay there under these circumstances, which my previous chargers could not handle.  These seem to be well engineered and produced, which I did not expect for the low price.<br /><br />I'll be using one of them for my daily commute, so we'll see how they hold up over the next year or so.  However, I don't expect any issues based on what I have seen so far.

She wants everything that has to do with Princess Sofia, including the movie, so she can take it with her when we're on the go. Nice way to keep the kids entertained for awhile, also like that Disney always has a positive message in their production. I recommend getting this for young children.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I raced through the pages. This is my second go round and I liked it even more. The characters were engaging and I was rooting for the good guys. I am sure I will read it again.
0307951529|4.0|This book has some good insight.  I think overall, the idea of $100 start-up is very exciting.  It is a book of hope.  I'd recommend this book to someone who has been thinking about starting their business &#34;someday&#34;, but just doesn't know where to start.  This book is a good starting point.

Just being thankful, and grateful for everything you have will make your life feel fuller, your mood feels better.  Not only does this give you daily things to focus your gratitude upon, but each day is cited with reasons why you should be grateful for these things.

B005KQVDH8|5.0|Love the movie, love the blu-ray.  Will be watching this movie quite a bit and introducing it to my grandson.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|As a standalone movie, this film is amazing.  There is no CGI and it blows most other modern horror films out of the water.  Too many people are comparing it to the original, which shouldn't be done.  Best horror movie in a long long time.  Can't wait for a sequel
B003M5AXN4|4.0|It's wild, outlandish, high speed and actually a pretty good &#34;good versus evil&#34; story.  From a business perspective, it does have some very good points that get demonized which is unfortunate.  People are in business to make money and racing is no different so Speed and his family need to realize this.<br /><br />But, in the end, the big corporation owner turned out to be a big cheater so of course they lose.  In real life, the cheater wins, gets caught, gets an expensive lawyer, pays back 1/10th of a percent of what he stole, writes a book and cashes in.
0446547638|3.0|The first book was more interesting to me, but then I discovered all the rest I read were just 'change' the name<br />and the tragedy. By the third book I was bored.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well his third book and not a disappointment at all.  I could read this author every month.  I have passed his first two around to friends and neighbors and recommended the books to my book club long before they became known.  Do not know of one displeased reader !!!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This was a decent weather app but with the update, the same result that happened to accuweather app. Why do these apps go backwards and less friendly is beyond me. It's free though and I will keep it, but I liked it way better before the update.

B004PVKFR8|5.0|Love most every song on it. Very talented group. Very upbeat great lyrics. Sail is the best song on it, but there are some close to as good.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|The guide was very helpful but not perfect.  There was still a good deal of troubleshooting required (Uploading and checking my book version several times before I got it right).  It was a good place to start as I was not satisfied with my prior PDF conversion at first, I needed to make a ms word version.

B00274EYKY|5.0|This film has depth. Very touching. Mickey Rourke's best film. One of my favorite movies, and I've seen many good ones over the years.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|First off, I cannot imagine someone (meaning 'an Eagles fan') not being satisfied with this. It's pretty damned amazing in what it presents, what unfolds, the whole kit and kaboodle. The music is about as good as it could get, the sound off the DVD is stellar, and the visuals pretty much match them. A fabulous performance, incredible production values... In a way, I'm stunned. Stunned and grinning.<br /><br />If you're an Eagles fan, this DVD is well worth the money.<br /><br />As for the musings...<br /><br />-The Eagles were part of my teenaged years. (Oddly -?- enough, so were Jackson Browne and Dan Fogelberg, contemporaries and friends of the band.) I scalped tickets for the March '78 Toronto show. Even more that 'Hotel California', 'The Long Run' was a staple on my turntable; I think I wore it out. However...<br /><br />-I'm no nostalgist. I don't listen to them and nod my head saying 'Yeah, man; those were the years!'  I listen to their songs and that's what hits me. Their songs. That's all. (I find that because they weren't part of a social 'movement', as for the sake of argument, The Doors, The Clash, New Wave bands, Nirvana and Pearl Jam were for their eras, the music isn't tinged by any of that crap. Yes, I realize that they were at the forefront of 'the California sound' in their day, but it had zero social ramifications.) They're ageless. To me, they don't represent anything other than incredible music. As Don Henley said, 'That's all.')<br /><br />-Having Steuart Smith as their sideman was, for me, the single most important element of this show/this tour working as well as it did. He is an incredible musician and adds an unbelievable amount of oomph to the performance. Amazing. (I still miss Don Felder, though.)<br /><br />-I'm no celebrity-worhipper. The whole idea makes me throw up in my mouth a little bit. But Joe Walsh is someone I'd pay to meet. On the street, in an elevator. I'd definitely want to shake his hand; I just love the guy. What he's come back from, his sense of humour, his often-overlooked talent... He makes me smile. In this video and in the clip of 'Hotel California' circa '76, the man shows what's inside him. I'm so glad he conquered his demons. (And I bet he thanks Whomever every day that he was brought back into the Eagles' fold when he was.)<br /><br />-Aging rock stars. A touchy subject. Especially as a lot of them are now in their 60s. The talent is still there, the voices are, for the most part, able to provide what they used to... So all this begs the question: 'When do you hang it all up?' (Part of this for me is the visuals: not sure I want to watch Joe or Henley 'getting older'. Not because it means that *I'm\\" getting older, too. It's just a matter of aesthetics. But I will say that Glenn Frey must have sold his soul to look as good as he does.)<br /><br />-This performance is almost nine years old. They're out on tour again, I won't see them, so I'd be curious to hear about the comparison between now and then. (May as well throw in the 'Hell Freezes Over' tour DVD.) Beuller? Beuller?<br /><br />-'The Eagles could be fined for 'loitering', their stage show is so boring'. That was said by a reviewer once. The funny thing is that they're actually more lively in this video than 'back then'. (And having waaaay more fun.)<br /><br />-Something I found fascinating as I've been re-listening to the entire catalogue is the shift in vocal duties from Frey to Henley. I'm a big Henley fan, he sings my favourite Eagles songs, but there's something about Frey's voice... It's got such timbre to it, far more range than Henley, and it goes without saying that it has a good deal more character. And yet I sing like Don... LOL<br /><br />-I am really appreciative of what the Eagles have provided musically for my life. They are a touchstone, a quite magical one at that. I am grateful beyond words. Thanks to all of you, past and present.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very smart and strategic game, totally enjoyed the intelligent scavenger hunt. Level 8 is a little presumptuous with the mathematical and I did need a hint to solve the final row, but beyond that this game is an awesome mental jungle gym!
B009B8YZKS|3.0|I expected a lot more for Halo.  Not much in the way of alien kick butt.  Acting good, story line so so.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This was truly a shame, one of those sequels to great movies that you just pretend was never made.  They completely gave up attempting any kind of story or plot or any of the unique factors that made the Die Hard movies great in the first place.  One of the reasons that Die Hard was so popular was that Willis's character defied the stereotyped action heroes of the day.  He wasn't muscle bound or indestructible, he wasn't a specialist in killing, etc.  He was the every man in an extreme situation.  This film took all of that away and left nothing but a guy screaming and pulling a trigger.  This film is pandering to the lowest common denominator by making about 10 minutes of air time that AREN'T scenes of gun fights and fist fights and car chases and explosions.  If this is it for the Die hard franchise there is no arguing that they definitely went out with a whimper.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|A way funny movie with entertaining music. My wifes favorite movie right now. Fat Amy is the best part of movie and so worth it!

B009KS4XRO|3.0|It was ok.  A little to &#34;busy&#34; for me or should I say too much was going on in the game.  I don't know exactly what I was expecting.
B00ANAC32U|4.0|It's an excellent product. It does what is expected. The glass no longer contacts any surface. It's as slim as possible, and it's not hard to get used to. After a day everything feels like normal. The only down side is how it looks. Although it's pretty and elegant, the phone looks a bit bulky with it. Usually the N4 looks really slim despite the large screen because of the form of the edges of the screen, but the bumper makes this illusion go away. That's why it's 4 stars.<br /><br />I certainly recommend it!!!!
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Bruce Willis is in the movie, need I say more?  He just can't loose with his type of movie.  He is just great playing this part.
B00B4804KS|3.0|Spielberg simplified movie classic out of the multilevel and more interesting/complicated bestseller from Michael Crichton. By far not one of his better films but in the quite watchable nicely done 3D version a kind of gem of an outdoor funhouse ride of many years past.

B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|First of all, it takes about 1gig of space and second, once you download it, it's says &quot;failed to connect&quot;
B00DHNB5CY|3.0|Gallons and gallons of blood! I bet they used at least a 55 gallon drum of fake blood. This version was not my favorite of the three movies. Here's why:<br /><br />If you saw either \\"Evil Dead\\" (original) or \\"Evil Dead II\\" or \\"Army of Darkness\\" they all had some sort of comic relief. Like \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" the \\"Evil Dead\\" movies had a little bit of wit mixed in with the blood. I think that made the movies more \\"fun\\".<br /><br />Now the latest \\"Evil Dead\\" was very well produced and scary. If I had never seen the originals, or if I had watched the trilogy after watching the new one, I might find the 2013 \\"Evil Dead\\" superior.<br /><br />The effects are marginally better in 2013 and the acting is much better in the 2013 version of \\"Evil Dead\\" . As with my other reviews I don't go into plot because a lot of other people already do that. Plus, most movies have such a comprehensive trailer that it alone gives away most of the movies flavor. To me, everything is a spoiler, so I won't do any of the usual plot descriptions.<br /><br />To sum it all up: If you like SCARY more than anything else, if disemboweling of guts or gouging out eyes is way more fun than a joke - \\"Evil Dead\\" 2013 is right up your alley. It has all that and more. Lots of \\"OH CRAP - DID YOU SEE THAT?\\" and those little moments that make you jump. Not a laugh in the whole movie. I don't think I kept my eyes on the screen due to the gross factor. That may be enough to make you watch, rent or buy it!<br /><br />Otherwise, start from #1, \\"Evil Dead\\" 1982 and work your way thru to the latest. It's funny, cheezy and scary with one big plus - BRUCE CAMPBELL! Bruce AKA @GroovyBruce on Twitter, you are my hero and one of the reasons I became a filmmaker. Sam Raimi is no slouch either. Both my favorite names to see in credits.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|this movie was hysterical!! would recommend it to anyone who enjoys comedy esp. family guy humor. it verges on vulgar but its very funny!!
B008XGW1CI|5.0|Stick with this one.  I was at least around 100 pages into the book before I was really captivated.  There are many characters to introduce, and it was only after quite a few pages that their interconnectedness became clear and I got a deeper understanding of their personalities and motivations.  Once I reached that point, however, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling's character development is fantastic in my opinion.  Each character is very, real, flawed, and multifaceted - you alternately sympathize with and dislike each of them as the novel progresses.  I must say that I also found some of her similes quite striking, something which I do not remember from her writing in the Harry Potter books.<br /><br />Keep in mind however that the book is dark, and addresses many social issues that at times can be quite depressing.  These issues are presented in a very raw, explicit manner, and is probably not for those looking for a \\"light read\\" or those who find the acknowledgement of these issues uncomfortable.  If you are looking for a book more similar to Harry Potter, with more plot-driven writing and clear \\"good guys\\" to root for, this is simply not the book for you.<br /><br />Summary:  Excellent, engrossing, and thought-provoking read for those who can stick with it through the first few pages and are not uncomfortable with the bleak subject matter.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the boom this game is a game a can play all day and night lol I do that anyways...my mom don't really play game like that but this game she does day
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The true point is incorrect. I live in Chandler, about 1 1/2 miles from downtown. It says my true point is Gilbert. I listed Chandler as home but it doesn't save it. Irony see anyway to change true point. Also th old app was much easier to navigate. New app is somewhat confusing.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|i loved this movie but i truly love ryan and emma stone in all the movies that they are in together... great flick!!!
B000067J1H|5.0|If you have never seen this movie, it is a must! I'm not a Brad Pitt fan, but this movie is probably his best. I could watch this over & over again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft should make an update so u can make portals but i &lt;3 Minecraft i play every single day i mean who doesn't like Minecraft u know what i mean
B004KPX4W2|5.0|So funny and exciting.  All the characters brought their own individual humor to the project. Laughed throughout the whole movie.  Totally enjoyable.  Can't wait to see Red 2.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|this movie was really good, kept making you think and had an unexpected twist... would recommend to anyone who likes mysteries

B006BDHAX0|5.0|Mahjong is the best game ever for using your brain.  I can't get enough and the race to finish is made better by trying to beat the time.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|It was as creepy and suspenseful the second time I read it as it was the first time! An ingenious plot!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|These books are the best! I have become addicted to reading. Also enjoyable to chat with friends who are reading the series.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Doesn't measure up to other weather apps.  Not much information and not organized well.  If you want the best try Wunderground and of course also NOAA.
B000001A3H|5.0|Honesly, I must say that Kyuss blows away everything from QOTSA but an opinion is like..... This is no doubt Kyuss's best album IMO.  Dragging along slow and sludgy, the music is like a soundtrack or an escape.  Its a little heavier than Circus Leaves Town but very similar.  For fans of Goatsnake, Soundgarden,  Melvins, Electric Wizard, OM, Cough, Shrinebuilder.....
B003XVYLDU|4.0|War, Time Travel, Marriage, Death, Aliens and a not so likely hero and So it goes.....  There is a reason it's a classic.
B0063M22QO|4.0|YOU CAN CHOOSE WHETHER YOU WANT A TIME LIMIT AND SEVERAL LEVELS. IT IS EASY TO ACCESS AND THE TILES ARE LARGE AND EASILY READ
1594204217|5.0|Another fantastic Pollan read.  This book has me baking bread, fermenting vegetables and getting family and friends to do the same.  My mother has the book now but  she says she will need her own, since she needs to refer to it as she experiments in the kitchen.  Even if you do not like to cook, you will enjoy this readable and entertaining book.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I'll be honest. I only became a MGS fan back in April of this year after playing 2&3 on the HD Collection. While the cutscenes are very long and frequent, the games themselves are just so enriching and fun. Even though I have skipped a lot of the cutscenes in the games that I have played, it still does not take away from the gameplay for me. I highly recommend this product and cannot wait for MGS V to come out. 5 stars!
B000002GY9|4.0|I like Tom Waits.  I bought this as it has the song, &#34;Step Right Up&#34;. The entire cd is pretty good.  Good for road trips.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|The DVD showed up within the expected time, was brand new and sealed in plastic. Couldn't ask for anything better!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Fringe is a show both my husband and I can enjoy.  It is intriguing and intelligently written, and the storylines are very entertaining - it hooks you like 24 did!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I hope that the next one isn't too long in coming!<br /><br />Tons of new twists and turns in this one. Totally worth the time and money to read it!
B00D2K40WY|3.0|This app is the best and I'm glad I bought it but it takes the LONGEST to download....yeah,  maybe its just my kindle but it took me an hour and a half to download. if you are buying it then I would have something else to do when its downloading..
B004AQR29C|2.0|Good to watch if you are craving a predictable blood and guts movie, but I see it as a waste of all the talented people in this movie and the lack of the writer to make better use of all the talent that was available here. There was a greater entertainment potential that was missed in this one, nice try but as the old saying goes no horseshoe.
0679805273|5.0|Wonderful book for all ages; great as a gift for graduating students of all ages. Gave it to an EL student who was moving on from Middle School to High School and she loved it.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|other than the fact that this movie made me unequivocally decide that I will never EVER take my children to a foreign country for holiday, it was fantastic.  An incredible story that ended well for this family.  I know that was rare and indeed the name of the movie truly is appropriate since the entire movie is about how impossible the whole situation really was at the tsunami and what a miracle occurred for this family.  Well worth the rental price.
B000002JSN|5.0|Do you ever vomit when you listen to famous and current \\"music\\"? I do. I just hurl. Then I turn on Floyd or Zep or the Stones or the Who or Hendrix, and I stop vomiting. This album is a good cure for puking.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|It is a fair movie, but nothing exceptional and at points it seemed to drag along to me. Guess the title was a bit misleading once you get into it or it is just not to my preference. I would say on this one to watch it and draw your own conclusions.
B0050IY61G|5.0|Easy to read, not too technical.  Quite a lot of different areas to read about whether parent, teacher, friend or Aspie yourself.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|Around half way through this book I began to tire of the series... and with the way this book and series ended made me think the author was feeling the same way. The book was nearly 400 pages and yet chose to wrap up most issue in the final 40ish pages. The ending was both predictable and unexpected. Predictable because nothing unexpected happen and unexpected because how was that the end? I began laughing when I realized there were only 3 pages left and I thought the story didn't truly deal with most of the central issues. I understand the use of ambiguity in a dystopian type novel but the ending didn't ambiguous it seemed rushed and unfinished. Easily one of the most disappointing finishes of a highly regarded book series! And not just because she didn't pick my choice in the love triangle! :)
B001MSMUH0|5.0|This encompasses a new way of looking at finding the direction in which to take your life.  Recommend for parents of teenagers.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|When watching the preview for this movie, I thought it could be either really good, or really stupid.  I'm happy it turned out to be really good.  I loved the story and the drama of it.  Overall loved it.  It makes me want to read the book.
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|Even after existing since 28 years, the Pet Shop Boys still sound fresh and highly motivated.<br />Electric sounds so different from their last Album Elysium, but you recognize the boys after only a few seconds.<br />This record is a great dance album, the next one will be totally different again...
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book,it made me laugh and cry.  The story is rich with insight and history.<br />The characters will stay with me for a long while.<br />The Kite Runner by him is my favorite book and this is right up there with if.<br /><br />I
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|great video quality, it was one of the favorites to watch for me and my family. Recommend this one for anyone looking to see a children friendly movie :)
