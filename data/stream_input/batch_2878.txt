B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is an amazing story, i cried  for three days, and re-read some parts of the book. I had a feeling that the main characters are my close friends.i like them. Thank the Author! Thank Amazon.
B004UID2LC|1.0|My calendar is STILL bugged with spam, even after a factory reset. I get event dates added by themselves all the time, reminding me to sign up for identity theft.<br /><br />Before the last update, this app was the Bee's Knee's! It was the best way to download free music off YouTube, without the worry of downloading a virus.<br />Now its just as scetchy and bugged as the other download apps.<br /><br />DO NOT DOWNLOAD
B002ZG97EC|4.0|more minions.. every home should have this. this movie plus the sequel are both good to have. trilogy hope so.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Loved the book and how they have managed to bring it to life has been excellent. As always, there are differences between book and movie, but this is incredibly enjoyable.
B0013527I4|5.0|Love it. All the episodes from season 3. Great stuff that I had forgotten all about. Still a classic show
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Ran across this book by chance and could not put it down! Very heart warming story, so many things I could relate to, having had a \\"Bob\\" in my life once too. Animal lover or not, read this book!
B004VOBIE8|5.0|I just recieved my Kindle Fire HD and looking forward to many hours of enjoyment and learning. The tutoring is good and it has opened a whole new world of interesting things to learn about.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|This is simply one of the best things currently on television. Cumberbatch is in the same class of actor as Jim Parsons in Big Bang Theory as he transcends the role he plays and truly becomes the character. Few actors have the ability to delve so thoroughly into a character's supposed subconscious. The writing is tight and story lines are taut.<br /><br />This is an exceptional series and certainly worth the time you invest in watching it.
B00846REIS|4.0|If you enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey but were bored by the end of the 3rd book, you will like the Crossfire Series better.<br /><br />There is a better storyline for the characters in this series and the writer doesn't rely on the same phrases over and over again.  There is still erotic scenes in these books, but I find myself wanting to see how the story ends, more than wanting another erotic passage in the book.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Downloaded this last time it was FAOTD. Played it through and found it to be an enjoyable version. I would say the &quot;storyline&quot; didn't hold my attention. The many varied and increasingly more difficult tiles based on location kept things interesting. The only ads I saw were for other games from this developer, which is typical. When people claim &quot;ads&quot; I would normally think ads that have nothing to do with the game or developer. Didn't see that here.<br /><br />Playing it on the phone worked, but didn't last long. Much easier to see tiles on a larger screen.
B009O07NBQ|4.0|My grandson fell in love with the music. At age 8, I want to encourage that. I previously introduced him to the soundtrack for &#34;1776&#34; and he often asks to hear it. Diverse taste is a good thing. I find The Hobbit sound a bit deep but then ....

1451624468|5.0|Lawrence Krauss does a wonderful job of explaining the history and current status of observational and theoretical cosmological investigations. I liked his explanation of how the experimental measurements of the granularity of the cosmic background microwave radiation show that the universe is flat, e.g. without curvature. As a quantum physicist, I was pleased, but not surprised, to find out that the universe of real matter that we see resulted from quantum fluctuations during inflation. There is no need to invoke string theory, additional dimensions, or branes. Go quantum mechanics! Einstein might not have been pleased. He was not happy about the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. He was reputed to have said that &#34;God does not play dice.&#34; Perhaps, that was his greatest blunder.<br /><br />Last year, as I was doing some gardening on a hot summer day, I was approached by two overly well-dressed people, who were representing their religion. After informing them that I already had a religion that laid claim to a history that beat theirs by over 5000 years, we discussed the intervention of God in the daily lives of people. I referred to what I thought was a very improbable event, something that would qualify as a miracle. I said that you could pray all you want, but not even God could make the Mets beat the Yankees. They agreed with me on that point, but walked away without even leaving any of their literature.<br /><br />This year, the Mets played the Yankees four times and won all four games. One explanation for this is that there is a being, who is a baseball fan, who delights in helping the hapless Mets. He has intervened for them on several occasions, most notably in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. How could anyone imagine that Mookie Wilson's slow grounder would go through the legs of a major league first baseman? A miracle indeed.<br /><br />In the Many Worlds formulation of quantum mechanics, whenever an event can have multiple possible outcomes, every one of those outcomes occurs in a different parallel universe. We happen to live in a universe in which improbable events have benefited the Mets. Thus the Mets' improbable victories may also be viewed as quantum fluctuations., every one of those outcomes occurs in a different parallel universe. We happen to live in a universe in which improbable events have benefited the Mets. Thus the Mets' improbable victories may also be viewed as quantum fluctuations.

B0032BMSXQ|1.0|Being a big fan of Gore products such as Windstopper and Gortex, and with their reputation as material science experts, I decided to give their line of bike wear a shot. These bibs look sharp , are well stitched and have a anatomically designed pad with a tight compression fit, that is until you start sweating. I question their product testing process because the material they used to construct these bibs does not wick moisture as does the suite of other bibs I own (Assos, X-Bionic, LG....). They actually hold in the moisture creating a rather disgusting feel against your skin and as a result sag under the weight of sweat build-up.  A real disappointment.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Had I written this review a couple of months ago, I would have given it 5 stars - it was compact and easy to use. However, since the last update, it's become a slow, bloated nightmare to use. &quot;Gifts?&quot; &quot;Points?&quot; It's a hot mess now. Better to go to the site and get the weather report there than try to navigate this ridiculous app.

B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Though the movie wasn't action packed or high suspense, it had a good story line and I did enjoy the unexpected twist.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could hardly put it down!  Very suspenseful!  May read some of her other books. Recommended by a friend who also loved it.

B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|As always with a Kelby book he starts right at the beginning and then guides you in small incremental steps to the end. I love using his books and can even put up with the wet sense of humour without reducing the rating because the quality of teaching is so high!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I am a fan of John Grisham but this story took too long to work its way out for my satisfaction. He is still one of my favorite writers, though.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I thought the book contained a very depressing group of characters.  Each character had something sad about them.  the end
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Flynn is the type of writer who develops her characters in layers like an onion: as the layers are peeled away, the scent becomes stronger and can bring you to tears. All three novels were page turners and I stayed away many a night hungrily absorbing the words and developing a relationship with the characters. I can't wait for gone girl to become a movie!
B00908DDZM|5.0|There has not been an album released in the past 5 years that has been played on auto-repeat so often. What an incredible rich album. Absolutely epic. The music is beautiful.

1582406723|3.0|SPOILERS!<br />Do not continue if you do not want to be spoiled.<br /><br /> The Walking Dead on television is awesome. The book.....well it's good enough.<br /><br /> The art in this trade is fantastic. The story is good enough to entertain.<br /><br /> The main problem is Mr. Kirkman rushes the story. Mr. Kirkman is not a great writer, he's good and his flaws are easily discovered. A lot of meat has been left out of the story. There's no build up, suspense, or tension. Story elements are thrown at you like bricks.<br /><br /> Rick goes from waking up in an empty hospital to meeting his wife and son in like 7 pages.<br />The Rick-Shane dilemma is resolved incredibly fast with no real emotional build up or execution.<br /><br />Overall it's not a terrible book, the art is great. This is a must-have for zombie fans, but for casual people....I'm not sure they're going to appreciate the book like a fan would. The story holes and lack of character/setting buildup is a real turn off if you're looking for survival horror/drama.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|when will you have season 4<br />I really enjoy Downton Abby. I read it will be available in UK very soon.

B004LWZW24|5.0|I recently saw the preview to part 2 of this movie, and i can't wait to go see it.  Many people love this movie and many people hate it.  I feel it is an erie and creepy movie.  The sound affects and music with the movie is great, and had me and my fiance on our seats.  Many people mock the demons in this, which makes me feel they don't have much of an imagination.  I'm not gonna give away the whole movie, but the movie is based on 2 main demons one who stalked the father when he was little and one who is now stalking his son.  We thought the music went along great with the demon stalking the child in the movie, it made the demon sicker in nature.  Others felt the first half of the movie didn't flow well into the second half, and I disagree.  the first half set the story up for the second half, and explains what is going on.  Yes, the theme of demons have been \\"played\\", but this movie has it's own fantasy like twist to the demons.  I'm glad they made a second movie, for the first left you hanging.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids were very excited when I put this on the tablet. At first they didn't understand how to make the minions move around but once they did they wanted to play the game for hours.<br /><br />It's a nice match of a known character with a fairly simple game that kids can enjoy.<br /><br />Edit: of all the apps we have the kids seem to really be locked onto this one the most. I had to help them beat the bosses but they enjoy running the track over and over and getting bananas to earn power ups.<br /><br />My one gripe is the bosses are very hard to see again once you beat them. It frustrates them sometimes they never seem to find the bosses (or it's super rare). I read some other comments that said this can be a common problem, with people running up scores in the hundreds of thousands but not seeing the boss anymore.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This is the ultimate!  It never slows down.  The story is very strong.  The characters are played perfect.  The scenes are breath taking.  The scenes make you gasp.  The scenes make you cry.  Don't blink your eyes or you'll miss something great.  Even tops my favorite Star Trek &#34;The Wrath of Khan&#34;  This movie is guaranteed not to disappoint.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|If you are looking into this product you should know it works well. The signal strength upstairs in my house isn't great but this picks it up and stays connected well. Setup wasn't not very difficult either. Had a problem with one tablet staying connected to the device but other tablets continued to work, so I think the issue is with the tablet itself. Kids love it and I like being able to control what they watch from another room (Netflix).<br /><br />The only reason for a reduced star is it's very limited currently in what applications it works with. Netflix, Youtube and Google Movies.I got it for Netflix so it does what I need. I know there is some confusion out there about what else it can do so I wanted to be clear in my review.<br /><br />The fact it came with 3 months of Netflix was great, it works with current customers too.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Visually, it was very nice but having wrap music playing over scenes that were suppose to be occurring nearly 100 years ago degrades the overall look and feel of the movie.  Leo did a good job as always
0312360266|5.0|I’m really liking these books. I have read all 10 that are out so far and love them. Its weird how in the beginning of a few I got bored but all of a sudden I’m pulled in and look up and 2 hours have passed. It’s a fun read. Nothing too serious. Its not just a vampire story but a teenage story. The other cool thing is that this story about vampires is a whole new one. Vampires living along with humans and everyone knows whos who. It also has a few funny parts. Can’t wait for the new one to come out in Oct.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is very cool and it is like I can take care of a real horse I love this game and always will
0857867970|3.0|A Tale for the Time Being is mostly set in the 21st century in Japan and Canada. The dominance of the setting changes with the location. The island where Ruth lives felt very clear to me. However, this could be because I've already been to British Columbia and Vancouver Island and know what the landscape looks like. But also the temple in Japan and its surroundings were clear, in contrast to Tokyo, which seemed blurry to me. Ms. Ozeki also uses the weather to create and intensify mood especially in Ruth's chapters. I really like this concept.<br /><br />The two main characters are Nao and Ruth. Even though Nao is 16 years old, she often acts like she is 14 or younger but on the other hand, she does things that (in my opinion) don't fit her childish behavior. Well, let's say, Nao has problems, which is hardly surprising if you read her story. Nevertheless, Nao's character wasn't always very believable throughout the book. I preferred Ruth. Her character seems to lead a steady life, but if you take a closer look, it isn't all roses. Ruth is fascinated by Nao's diary and wants to know all about that girl from Japan. I was really able to connect with Ruth, at least until the last few pages. Two other characters that I think were great are Nao's father Haruki and Nao's great-grandmother Jiko.<br /><br />Now on to the hardest part (at least for me). The story. For the first ~125 pages, I had massive problems getting into the book. I was thinking about giving up on reading, because I didn't care what was going to happen to Nao or to anyone else in the book. The only thing that kept me going was the fact that I hardly give up on a book. So I read on and it did get better. I finally wanted to know about Nao's (and her father's) fate. Sometimes, I even felt distracted by Ruth's story between Nao's passages. But there were still things that I didn't like. There was too much talk of Zen Buddhism in the book and, unfortunately, the book started to get quite boring again towards the end (even though I like the main idea of the ending). Maybe A Tale for the Time Being just wasn't meant for a time being like me.the end (even though I like the main idea of the ending).

B00EQNYOYU|5.0|The evolution of NIN doesn't disappoint. While I understand the sentiment from long-time fans that this album isn't as 'hard hitting' or in your face as previous albums from the catalog, I feel this new effort blends the best of what NIN can be with the influence of what is current in 2013 culture. I'm perfectly okay with an artist exploring and entertaining new ideas. To me \\"Hesitation Marks\\" is so great because the songs are understated in their textures, refined in a way that I can respect and diverse in layering. Screams and growls at full volume are not needed to convey the feeling or message of a song.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I love this mystery series. It is very well acted; lots of potential suspects....backstories of major characters add to the intrigue.
B000MV90IU|5.0|What can I say. This is the classic Bullit movie with the first really awesome car chase sequence ever. It's also a pretty good movie even today.
B004CFAWK2|4.0|I think the only thing that stopped me from giving this book five stars was the constant going back and forth in time and many a place with every chapter.  You need to pay a certain amount of attention to keep the characters straight within the changing storyline but it is definitely worth the extra effort.  This is just a sweet story about a little town and the people who lived there, with a little bit of intrigue thrown in just for fun. So true to real life, so unpretentious and very fulfilling to the reader. A highly recommended read.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|it was a birthday gift for my daughter and she loves it.  she was very excited when she opened it.

1451695195|2.0|This book was a great lesson in the technicalities of Coma, but not really much about the NDE. At least not what I expected. Most of the book was about medicine, only a little about the NDE. I am not sure at all why this book has been on the NYTimes 50 List for months. I almost sent it back a number of times, but finished it nonetheless. A disappointing read for me.

B005QYKD4I|2.0|Or worst, depending on how you look at it.  Confused, hectic story that is hard to follow, paper-mache characters without soul, and over-reliance on special effects.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|It is exactly what my son expected!  He loves anime...to draw, to read, to dress up as for Halloween!  And now he can build his action figures collection thanks to Amazon.
B00AHHODH2|3.0|Builds multiple story lines and brings only one to completion and very abruptly.  A bit anticlimactic and juvenile.  Glad it was a freebie.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|I rented this for my dad to watch one weekend and he really liked it.  I wasn't able to find it on my xbox amazon prime movies list when I did a search for Red.  That meant I had to get on my phone to order it, add it to my watchlist and then I was able to find it on the xbox.  That was the only hastle.  Besides that I was happy with the rental.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Loved this book.  Absolutely hilarious.  Also, whispersync is one of the coolest ideas to hit e-books in a long time.  Read/listened on a couple long plane rides.  Tina Fey is a comedic genius.  It was easy to relate to her stories.
B0081336FO|5.0|I found this series to be an excellent change from the usual fare on video. I am a fan of the Sherlock character, so I am probably biased, but this update to the original plot lines is well done. I think it is definitely worth the time to watch this series.

125000098X|4.0|Jeffrey Archer is a terrific author and over the years I believe I have read all his books and enjoyed them immensely. This one does not disappoint. However if you have not yet read the first two in this series, I suggest you do not start. Each book ends in a place where there are all sorts of loose ends around. I find this a bit unsatisfying. Of course it makes it virtually mandatory to buy the next volume - this no doubt is the objective of the author.<br /><br />I had thought that Best Kept Secret was the third book of a trilogy. What a shocker to find out this was not to be! Is there even a word for the fourth book as in trilogy plus one? Will I buy it. Of course, i am addicted!
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|I should have listened to more music clips before buying this CD. I bought it for my grandson to take on vacation.I insisted he at least listen to the whole CD before  ejecting it. It ended up ion he back seat floor board floor never to be played again. I will not make that mistake again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series  Very well done. Acting is great. And the story line keeps you on the edge of your seat. I watched eoisode aftet episode one after snother. I can't wait until season 4!! I'm anxious to see what happens next!
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|This album is a joy to listen to. Trent has stepped his game up since the release of the mediocre 2009 effort \\"The Slip.\\" The production here is top-notch, and each song is a unique entity in the ever-growing world that Trent Reznor has crafted. Almost every song is captivating and infectious, and its pulsing rhythms will keep you interested until the very end. Trent's creative juices have grown into something cohesive and immensely enjoyable. This is honestly NIN's best album since The Fragile, in my opinion. This is the NIN album that I've been waiting a long time for. The tribal chanting of \\"Running\\" is reminiscent of Radiohead, and the song \\"Everything\\" sounds a little/lot like New Order. I can picture \\"Satellite\\" being played in nightclubs, if it were chosen as a single. A flaw with NIN is usually Trent's lyrics, and on some albums they are weak. Here they have grown and matured a little bit, and they are not as adolescent as they have been on more recent albums. All in all, this is a fantastic entry in the NIN catalog and I can't help but hope for another knockout album like this in a few years (after extensive touring of course).
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I have read every James Rollins novel, and they just keep getting better. If you have read the other Sigma Force novels, you know what to expect . Brilliant, smart, and exciting! Eye of God kept me hooked from start to finish. James Rollins is the man when it comes to action adventure. Enough said. Read this book!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I've read Fall of giants and was looking forward for the sequence. Now I'm looking forward for the third one. I liked the book a lot, but I think Ken Follett could have developed more the stories of the characters from the first book.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|A thorough but quick read and very insightful as to the future of employment and our relationship with technology. I highly recommend.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I like it a lot. Oscar Wilde has a great sense of humour and a well knowledge of the human nature, its psychology and its miseries.

B00CMYRVAO|4.0|I can still remember the first time I heard \\"I'd rather have a love,\\" wow, thought music like that was not even possible anymore
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Easy style of writing, lots of examples of situations and incidents that Sheryl Sandberg has experienced, leading to her own personal success.  Written with a degree of humility, but basically, the message is one of re-enforcement and a good reminder to have courage.  She offers a fresh look at an old story,reminding the readers to assume a leadership role without having to be &#34;invited to the table&#34; as they maintain a level of self-confidence that is appealing in the male-dominated arena, while remembering to lend a hand up to others along the way.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|Such a wonderful talent with soo many demons that she couldn't conquer, glad you left us some music that will live on.  RIP
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|The new Joe Walsh album &#34;Analog Man&#34; is fantastic! Great humor,great  guitar playing, and beats any of the terrible songs most FM radio is playing these days! A must have!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Smart/Ingenious telling of an impossibly difficult story. Be prepared to cry through the last third of the book. Completely worth it!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Totally hooked on Fringe now. Almost through season 1 and it just keeps getting better. Had to find something to replace Eureka and Fringe fit the bill.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Great movie, better than the Sly Stallone one. Hopefully we'll see a sequel in the works. Will definitely recommend to friends and family to watch.
B000002GYN|5.0|Anything that the Eagles do, whether it be audio music or in person concert does not disappoint.  Keep it coming.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very addictive I love this game much better than other free hidden object games I have downloaded which is the reason for the five star rating
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My four year old an i played for over an hour!  We had such a great time earning bananas to dress our minions! Good time
B000FBJEL0|5.0|Psychologist Jeremy Carrier's life fell apart when the love of his life was brutally murdered and though six months have gone by, he is still shattered by her death, and the fact that he was a suspect in his girlfriend's murder made his ordeal infinitely worse.<br /><br />Now Homicide detective Bob Doresh is back at the hospital with more questions. A forty-five year old prostitute named Tyrene Mazursky has been murdered in the same fashion and Doresh wants to know if Jeremy has an alibi. Then another prostitute is murdered.<br /><br />Dr. Arthur Chess, sort of a professor emeritus at the hospital where Jeremy works, befriends him and invites him to a get together with several other oldsters who have irregular meetings to discuss whatever catches their fancy and now it looks like conspiracy, serial killers and unsolved murders have caught their interest.<br /><br />Slowly Chess feeds Jeremy clues as he feels the pressure of the police closing in and the urgency of having to solve the murder before the killer strikes again or the police arrest him and throw away the key.<br /><br />Kellerman has introduced a new protagonist and though he's not the Alex Delaware we've come to know and love, I suspect we'll be seen more of Dr. Carrier in the next couple of years and I for one wouldn't mind that at all.
B004SBQAL0|5.0|I loved the movie. I rented this so many times I finally bought it.  If you like action you'll enjoy this since some action leading to the real action later in the movie, as in battling blasts and explosions and fighting. The beginning of the story leads you nicely towards the ending.  I wish they'd make another one, as in make a series. The layout reminds me a little of Harry Potter in the sense that the beginning and tension leads you to the later action (battle), including no parent criticized words or sex. Other movies I liked: Beautiful Creatures,  Pitch Black, Harry Potter,  The Secret of Moonacre, The Mummy.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|With his raspy voice Leonard Cohen makes you feel as if he is singing on your sofa, just for you.
B003TOMAPC|3.0|Kick Ass was an interesting, well conceived action movie that failed to be much more than that.  The characters were interesting and the story mediocre at best, with the action scenes not much better. Kick Ass needed a little something more to be really kick ass!!!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|The CDs have a little of everything, flute, sax, harmonica,and with a dab of talking that makes it so personal
0071766588|5.0|A very good book, didactical and easy to review. I am preparing for my toefl test with this book, I have an upper intermediate level, finishing this book I hope to get excellent scores. Thanks.<br />Carolina.
B00BJ7G1VK|4.0|This is the first cookbook that I purchased as an eBook. Although the photographs are great and I do like some of the features that having an eBook allows, like clicking on a link within the book to move to a cited area, I'm not certain that I will buy many cookbooks in this form, there's just something about having a cookbook in hand for me. This is a sweet book with easy to follow recipes that are well laid out. However, if you are feeding a family of 4 consistently, especially if you have hearty eaters, many of these recipes will have to be adapted to feed more. There are quite a few 2 person recipes, the 4 person recipes would not feed my husband plus my girls, and there are even some that only serves 1. This is not marketed as a family friendly cookbook, so there's no bait and switch here, I just assumed that the recipes would feed at least 4. But you know what they say about assuming...The recipe that I've made and I enjoyed but it was a fail for the family is the Lemon and Lavender Chicken. I thought that it was lovely and the smell that filled the house while it was cooking was amazing, but alas the lavender flavor was a bit of a stretch for hubby & co. so I won't be making it again. However, there's a recipe for Burgundy Beef with Baguette Dumplings that I have my eye on to try. I think what will save this cookbook from being a bust for me will be the desserts, there's a recipe for a very simple creme brulee with my name on it. If you are looking for an introduction to French cooking this may very well be worth your while if you don't mind adjusting measurements, or are only feeding a very small family.
B002WY65VU|4.0|This movie is fun from the first scene to the last. I enjoyed every minute of it. Please do a sequel or TV series.<br />Well written characters and story.<br />Good direction and editing.<br />Great comedic acting.<br />Fun...fun...fun.
B000VK99Z6|3.0|but not the best movie ever.  requires a certain mood and sensibility.  Well done parody of action movies of a genre that I don't watch.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Absolutely one of the fumiest movies I've ever seen. I love Simon Peg in everything he does. Nick Frost is the best parring with Simon Peg!!!<br />Great buddy flick!<br />Great classic Zombie movie!<br />Great comedy!!!
0143123173|5.0|Glad I found Craig Johnson and his sheriff, Walt Longmire - loved the book.  I won't have known about this book if I hadn't watched the TV series (which I just love) and is doing a pretty darn good job of interpreting the book's characters.  Love the book and looking forward to reading the second in the series.
B005BX3NAA|5.0|I love being able to drive in my car and relive the 80s and 90s! Excellent buy for a variety of G&R music.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I don't always listen to &#34;country&#34; music but sometimes it is just what I want and need to hear.  Vince and Paul do a great job of recapturing that special Bakersfield sound.  Both are just top notch musicians and this CD is a treat.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I just love this game. I start and can not stop. I would like my friends to try this. look for on you tablet or comp. and have fun
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This was an inspirational story. I am so glad I found this . If you just  try you can do anything!
0763644765|5.0|This book is simple. My daughter is 18months old and enjoys looking through the book while she sits on the potty. Right now I'm just introducing her to the potty and getting use to it. She obviously can't read at this time, but the book is simple enough to understand that there is a baby who needs to pee, uses the potty, something happens in the potty that makes the parents happy and now the baby doesn't need diapers anymore.
1451695195|5.0|WONDERFUL BOOK.  REALLY INTELLIGENTLY WRITTEN WITH HEART AND SMART.  IT WILL CONFIRM YOUR BELIEF IN HEAVEN.  GREAT BOOK TO SHARE.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A wonderful journey to walk along with Harold.  The story has a nice twist at the end that I didn't see coming. Would recommend to anyone.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Can't put it down! As always Gabaldon has woven a grand story....the characters and their stories are so intriguing...sheer heaven to read!
B001B68XRY|5.0|Some get upset because this is not the original. But do not listen to them. This is a great remake. Loads of fun. By the way, I saw the original when it came out, and it was a riot, too.
B00A50PBEA|4.0|A very innovative and well done adaptation of Mozart's timeless wonder.  The English translation seems superb.  But without subtitles (or program notes with the translation), I could make out only about 50% of the words.  I would have given the disc 5 stars had English subtitles been available.  I have bought two copies of the disc and given away one - I'll buy more for gifts if subtitles become available.  How about putting them on the Blu-ray version?
B00466HN6S|5.0|Just love Russel Brand ... what can I say ... his voice, energy, and humor is right on!  My grand kids of all ages love it, and us grown-ups love this film as well.  I highly recommend it!
B00B97SNJI|5.0|I assume there are other music loving nerds out there like me, always on the search for &#34;the perfect album.&#34; If you're one of us, you know what I'm talking about—you're constantly hoping that the next album you get is not only listenable all the way through, but really enjoyable. And it just keeps getting better with each listen. You notice that really cool background harmony, or that heartbreaking lyric, or that little mistake that the bass player made that makes it feel like human beings actually put this thing together. Over time, the album becomes like an old friend. No matter how bush league your day is, you know you can rely on this album to brighten you up. You give your copy to a friend, so you can buy the deluxe edition that just came out. You name your dog after a character in one of the songs. You quote the lyrics as if everyone else knows them inside and out like you do. You name your kid after your dog. You guys know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />&#34;Stories Don't End&#34; is one of those albums. Get it, and listen to it in your car for a month straight. If your life isn't qualitatively better at the end of that month, then you were probably doing something wrong.
B00622D3BS|4.0|Good movie for a nothing better to do evening...funny scenes but overall falls apart...if wasn't for Steve Carrel I would've ranked it 1star
B008ALA6DW|4.0|Other than being overpriced, I have no complaints about this.  Note, the USB mac Wired network adapter is 10/100 (no Gigabit).  This one does all 3:  10/100/1000.  If you need speed, this is the one for you.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|I bought this for a friend and I must say she was very happy to receive this for her birthday. I was received on time and in good condition.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|The cards are all beautiful, large, nicely printed. A friend of mine considered buying the game and use a few of the cards as decoration for her house and in her office.<br /><br />The game is awesome, you can play it even with children/young adults (though they tend to be too literal on their card hints). Even a few friends who are resistant to play board or card games have tried it and liked it!<br /><br />The more players, the better!<br />Sure to bring up some laughts, it's perfect for those tha don't enjoy more focus- and calculations- demanding games.<br />Just lovely!
B00BKTFABE|4.0|I picked this camera app, because it could be used to shoot videos as well as photos. It is simple to use--just press the button for photo & it is immediately ready to take a photo or push the button for videos and you are set to shoot a video.  I thought that the pictures & videos were of good quality.  Also, the sound quality on the videos was good.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I don't know about people born after the 80's, but I believe this book is great for those who lived in that decade (as a child, a teen or an adult). I remembered so many things from that age, I found out I didn't know so many other things! The sci-fi and fantasy/adventure parts of the book are also great and, though a few parts of it felt a little too naive or childish, I really liked most of the book! A fun, fast-paced read - it's worth a shot!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A wonderful experience told by someone with unique credibility!  It has changed my life!  Everyone should read this.  A skeptic changed to a true believer!
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I really the movie, and just had to read this. I liked comics on my teen years, but never went really far from Superman, Batman, Spiderman and X-Men at the time. As an adult, the darker, more violent, political, sexual context and developments of this comic hooked me up like few sci-fi or fantasy works could. A masterpiece.
B005544TRQ|4.0|My high school nephew turned me on to this show. He recently told me that he wants to go into law. Now i understand his motivation :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The best book series that I have ever read in my life. It ended in the most perfect way that it is almost unbelievable. Susan Collins did a fantastic job in this series and could not have done any better!
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|It's an ok Sunday evening movie.  I love music so that made it more entertaining.  It's definitely a 3 star movie.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam does a great job of consolidating a lot of theory into a well-compacted, easy-to-understand workbook. Even without doing the experiments, it's tremendously informative - dare I say a page-turner - and exciting to believe in the content. I also like the way she pulled in references to &#34;A Course In Miracles&#34;.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is one of the best children's books that I have had the privilege of reading. I liked the book so much that i bought it and also listened to it on audio. I have been trying to get not just kids, but adults to read it. Yes, it ends well, but the story has its times that you don't know if Auggie is going to last the first full year of school in the fifth grade. It is inspirational book that is full of character. It is a book not to be missed!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Excellent for first graders and up. Great graphics, easily readable, displayed and can be used as entertainment for a child

B004LWZW42|5.0|I have been a follower of the X-Men for quite some time now. From the comics to the cartoons, I even remember seeing the 1st X-Men movie back in the early 2000s. And look how far the franchise has come. I have watched the X-Men movies(including this one) numerous times, but none have impressed me the way X-Men First Class has. Here are my thoughts.<br /><br />When I first heard back in 2010 that production had started and who some of the cast members were, I did have my doubts. I remember having at least 100 questions like: Can James McAvoy portray Professor X the right way? and Is Michael Fassbender the right person for Magneto? And the biggest question I had was Am I going to like X-Men First Class? I went into First Class with low expectations and came out with extreme awe, excitement, and ready for more.<br /><br />First Class has an enormously well thought of cast that consists of: James McAvoy as Charles Xavier, Michael Fassbender as Erik Lensherr, January Jones plays Emma Frost, Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy, Zoe Kravitz starring as Angel, Lucas Till as Alex Summers, Edi Gathegi(Laurent in Twilight) as Darwin, Jennifer Lawrence starring as Raven, a memorably hilarious cameo from Hugh Jackman as Logan, and Kevin Bacon as the villain Sebastian Shaw. Everyone acted his/her role exceptionally well; Michael Fasbbender, Kevin Bacon, and surprisingly James McAvoy steal the show.<br /><br />It is not so much the story itself; the detail and the realness that this movie has is well worth mentioning. Ironically, the time period is set around the 1960s, a controversial and hard time in American history. Professor X poses the thought/idea that there is/are more to mutants than meets the eye; Erik offers that while mutation is indeed something truly unique, mutants can/will never be accepted in a human world. Erik sees superiority, Charles sees/wants peace. X-Men First Class has the necessary drama, the butt kicking action, and right amount of great acting to make this movie standout in a great way.<br /><br />I do have a minor gripe with Edi Gathegi's and Lucas Till's characters;(which honestly is my only gripe with the movie) I wish their characters had maybe been given better lines or more to do in the movie, but thanks to Matthew Vaughn's amazing direction, it is easily overlooked.<br /><br />2014 is going to be a big year for movies, followed by arguably the biggest year cinema will ever see in 2015. I am beyond ready for X-Men Days of Future Past, and while it took a lot of thought and heavy consideration, X-Men First Class gets a highly rated score of<br /><br />9.25/10ie standout in a great way.<br /><br />I do have a minor gripe with Edi Gathegi's and Lucas Till's characters;(which honestly is my only gripe with the movie) I wish their characters had maybe been given better lines or more to do in the movie, but thanks to Matthew Vaughn's amazing direction, it is easily overlooked.<br /><br />2014 is going to be a big year for movies, followed by arguably the biggest year cinema will ever see in 2015.

B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I loved the way this provokes thought and gives you insights to Steve Jobs vision. It shows how that with belief you can do anything you want to do. I would recommend this as one of the better autobiographies I have ever read.

B00DF0POXA|1.0|There's nothing innovative or original here. Yes, there are some interesting mixes and transitions, but that's all overshadowed by the lazy, uninspired lyrics.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|Did not help at all. I need all the help I can get. Stuck on level 107. Someone please help!!!!
1878424505|5.0|A definite aid to achieving enlightenment. Written  with  the most effective simplicity and oozing with love. What a find after many books of others that bring you to an understanding and prepare you for the  &#34;How&#34; which  Ruiz's books provide..
0743289692|5.0|Infidel was an interesting insight into the Muslim religion.  I had a hard time putting it down.  I can't imagine how hard it must for a women living under these philosophies of their religion.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|So addicting, clever, and well written.  I've never read through a series as fast as I did this one.  It has something for everyone.  So creative!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Who is this author and how have I missed her for so long? Wow! Great characters, great intersections, great pause for thought.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|This game is very much like the game titled Stupid Zombies. Both of which are really just &quot;Get the right angle&quot; type games. They're great to pass the time. This game has a cleverer story and some different mechanics... Definitely worth it, especially as a FAOTD.
0345803507|5.0|i am not much of a reader however this book is the absolute best!!!  i cannot wait till the movie comes out!
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|A favorite of mine for many years.  Perfect casting and a pleasure to watch a movie that was made before four letter words and bodies being blown apart replaced dialogue and plot.<br />Cary Grant as an angel?  Hey, Why not?
B000ZN802W|5.0|I am going on a journey myself soon, traveling throughout Southeast Asia for a couple months. When reading the reviews on this movie I realized how many people were touched by this story, as well was I. My only regret was not reading the book first which I would recommend to read also. Great story with a  sad ending, but I think it was what he would have wanted.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I bought this for a family trip me and my girlfriend were taking.  Ended up working great!  Charged my droid and her iPhone twice on a single charge.  Does suck that it does not come with a wall charger but regular micro USB cords will work.  Turns the plug super hot though.  But now my girlfriend uses it on her commute to work (a 2 hour commute 1 hour 30 mins on the train and 30 mins on a bus) (thats one way).  She can watch her movies, play her games, and check her apps on her iPhone and never has to worry about the phone dieing having this.  Its the same size as a deck of cards, little heavy but not bad at all.  I would highly highly suggest getting this or the bigger ones from Anker! I must have if you are a phone addict!
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Loved the movie, the story and the music. Just wished I would have read the book! I recommend this soundtrack, movie, and the book!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Book was great. Definitely going to buy it. Can't wait till the movie comes out! I hope I see it in 3-D! ;)
B0048WQDIE|3.0|I bought this thinking it would be a great book, but am having the hardest time finishing it.  The characters are all crazy and nothing makes sense.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely lived it couldnt and didnt  want to put it down didnt want it to end was a roller coaster of actiin and great sex
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Received this product in the mail the same day of the release. I LOVE WALKING DEAD ! The holding case for the DVDs is awesome. Can't wait for season 4
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|we chose this game because my 3 year old loves animals including fish.  we love playing this game together. Even though he is only 3 he has great eye hand coordination, and it enhances his memory.  He is very electronically enclined for 3 years old and the games made for his age bore him.
B00A81NFAS|3.0|I really looked forward to this movie - what with the best actress award. After watching it, it was clear that I'd seen the basic story several times before, maybe done better. As to the best actress award - Jessica Chastain got robbed.
B00417HUV0|5.0|While this is not as hard hitting as any of their live recordings, sometimes it's exactly what I want. Considering this is not contemporary music, if there ever was a CD that best portrayed what Twisted Sister is all about, this is it. I have been a fan for a very long time, and bought this to replace my tired old vinyl.<br /><br />If you have never heard them and want to just see what all the fuss was about, consider buying this CD. I am sure you wont regret it.
0062255657|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a beautiful story if not just a little creepy. It's also a very adult story told from a 7 year old boys point of view, which at times can be very unsettling. I loved this novel and would highly recommend it to just about anyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was challenging enough that I stayed up doing the first six levels.  Got stuck on six because is was so good of a game I was playing it too late and was not at my best mental state.  Get the game and have some fun with the mind strategy puzzles that will not break you but will entertain you.
B00CHILW64|2.0|Boring, noisy and difficult to stay with. We did't waste time watching until the end, even if it is a true story.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This book was awesome, seriously. I don't think I've been so engrossed by a book in 20 years. Excellent story, plot, and cadence. I loved it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4! So much tragedy for the family, how much more can they take and still keep going??!!!
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|The best Nine Inch Nails albums are (at least in my opinion) without a doubt the first three: Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, and The Downward Spiral. Part of what made them great was not only the amazing music but the fact that they came when they did. Trent Reznor brought a ferociousness to electronic (\\"industrial\\") music that even heavy metal couldn't match. His particular genius was to pair it with powerful rhythms and lyrics that (though occasional silly in retrospect) really spoke to the increasingly disenchanted music listeners of the late '80s and early '90s. Because of both the music itself, which definitely holds up well, and time at which it happens, I don't think it's possible for Nine Inch Nails to totally match the achievements of that era.<br /><br />Hesitation Marks comes very close, though. This is easily the best NIN album since that golden era. Though they've made some good music (it's always tempting to say \\"he,\\" as it's really Reznor's show, even when others contribute) since then, this is the first album to capture the magic. Much of Reznor's mystique has been tempered as we've seen him grow into a family man, win an Oscar, and become an established personality in the music world, rather than the mysterious outsider who took Lollapalooza by storm all those years ago. We also know his tricks pretty well by now. So it's all in the execution. And, this time out, he executes tremendously.<br /><br />The blips and bleeps, the crunching guitars, the skittering beats: everything works from beginning to end on Hesitation Marks. Listen to Pretty Hate Machine today, and one of the most striking aspects is that it has so many elements that we identify today with electronic dance music. Hesitation Marks reclaims some of those elements while again presenting those sounds in a darker atmosphere. This is what happens when an innovator becomes a craftsmen but continues to push in a meaningful way.<br /><br />Longtime fans who may have drifted off over the years, this is the album to come back for.this is the album to come back for.
B00EI6E17A|2.0|Repetitive, simple minded, and the picture looks like a mime with a cold sore got left out in the rain.<br /><br />She can do better.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Despite it being very similar to other games, my kids love it because of the tie in to the Despicable Me Minions.
0399255370|5.0|My 4 year old son wants to read it every night, twice! It is witty and fun to read. If crayons could talk, this is exactly what they would say.
B000QFQE4U|5.0|An epic piece of amercan history performed incredibly well...powerful. This is a must see. incredible piece of work by Washington
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I keep trying to play this but just do not know how. I guess I will have to google up some instructions
B000066C1N|5.0|If you like Bryan Adams then you will love this CD! The music my kids love and definitely a family friendly cd
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|fun game, you have only 60 seconds to try and beat your friends and your old score. a good stress reliever.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It is refreshing. It is also fun and challenging in that you will have to think and strategize. Good for everyone.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Love the new Star Trek movies.  This one wasn't quite as good as the first but it was still very well done and it has Benedict Cumberbatch and Leonard Nimoy (who should be considered a national treasure).  I recommend this to any sci-fi geek (myself included) or anyone wanting to check out a great film!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|i had fun trying to figure the rooms out. but when i finished level 8, i was shocked. i would like to know why you had the illumination symbol oh the key? (the pyramid and all seeing eye in the pyramid) I don't support things that support the illuminati. people think I am crazy but I am telling everyone, you better open your eyes and wise up. its almost to late. removing the app and will never play your line of games again.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This is a fun match three game. I like  that you can compete against your friends thru Facebook. The fact  that it's free is good  too.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I'm having a fun time playing this game. I must say, it is wonderful not to be hounded to buy extra chapters at each and every turn.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a while. Great storyline, great characters, and was incredibly upset that it was over when I finished.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|By far, the best game I've had the pleasure of setting down and enjoying. I have downloaded many HO games, this one was by far, the best of the best. I was not disappointed!
B00DGN51O8|2.0|Jack the Giant Slayer was quite the disappointment for me and my family. While I didn't have super high expectations, I rented this on amazon to watch with my family of 5 and the gore was over the top for my 5 and 6 year old daughters to sit through. I see no reason why it was necessary to have eyeballs popping out and heads being ripped off all while being advertised as a children's movie.<br /><br />I'm not one of those people who think that gore is a major issue but when it's over the top I can't help but advise other parents that they may want to preview it before letting their little ones watch it. Cheers.
B004EI2NM2|5.0|It's a great movie. It's very beliveable. I recommend it highly. The actrisses are women not teeny boppers. They knew hoe to mak4e love.
B00DURGZHW|3.0|Before seeing this movie we were astonished by the &#34;rave reviews&#34; that the critics were giving it, sadly we were disappointed. The movie would have been better had we tempered our expectations a bit. Overall, a decent film.
1455526959|5.0|Michael Connelly will always have me for a fan  as long as  Harry is alive and continuing to frustrate the LAPD.  I love the  man and the way he thinks.  He is a great model for us older people who continue to work everyday.  Never give up or in.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Very good in helping you get the pictures in your head of the people<br />I try reading this book every couple of years since it came out.
1455576387|5.0|I don't have any idea about how David Baldaccci continues to find new angles to his stories.  He always comes up with something so off the wall and fun that it is still amazing to me.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Got Season 2 and Pre ordered 3 (waiting for that in the mail now).<br />Season two came on time and was as described, new.<br />Would recommend series to any zombie/survival lover
B00821PCJS|5.0|I cannot believe I had never seen this show before, it is GREAT!!!  I can't wait to get to the next season!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A better understanding of the unique fighting forces called SEALS. Hard book to put down. A very special and heartfelt Thank You to all the men and women who have fought and died for their country. My father included.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|We had a blast watching this as a family. I may have had more fun watching my kids scream and get freaked out by the suspense than I did watching the show, but when I was watching, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not your average predictable show.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is nice to read, has devotional, movie clips. and works for me, so who will read it me,,, every day now.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|it is so awesome. they added bad piggies to it! but there are some cons. it gets harder and harder as you go. there is an impossible level that only the awesome people can pass.
B005NFWCSK|4.0|Grandkids loved it. Was a good storyline explaining the friendship between Professor and Magneto. One small minus, they now think that the X-men really stopped the Cuban Missile Crisis.
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|I was thrilled to find this combo on amazon.  however, if you are new to buying digital copies like myself, beware.  without the code on one of the pieces of paper, you cannot redeem the digital copy.  I wish that would have been brought to my attention.  I simply threw the papers away thinking they were all advertisements.  however, the product is exactly as described and my daughter is a big fan of the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent show.  Keeps interest always something new happening. Characters are great  actors bring characters alive and make you feel you know them
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Been hearing so much about Breaking Bad and how good it is that I gave in and bought the first season. Glad I did, everyone was right, very good writing and the acting to match.
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|Great season of a great show! Any Doctor Who fan will want this in their collection for sure. In my opinion, it contains some of the best episodes, and one of the best and most spunky companions, of any season of Doctor Who.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Super fun game with lots of levels and exciting challenges.  Can be enjoyed by many as a fun pastime. Great!
0062255657|5.0|As a long time reader who has recently spent a heartwrenching amount of time out of the habit, this was the perfect novella to bring me back to the fold. Written simply, wondrously, and truthfully (as truthful as one may be when writing fiction), this masterpiece hints at a world that is so much more than it seems, and so much less than any adult has ever tried to make their children believe. It's the perfect morsel of whimsy, and I devoured it with abandon.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I find this book to be GREAT.  It is a book that comes out of left field with a completely different point of view on the topic.  For me, it was like getting the looser side of the story after a fight...opened my eyes to a different perspective.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is the best app I ever used so easy to use , gave me the option of the quality of the video
B007FEFLTO|3.0|The book is a great read.  I felt at times that it was somewhat repetitive and the drama somewhat as I expected.  Few surprises.  It is a nice follow-up to the Fall of Giants, but I personally loved the characters in the first book much better.
1419705644|5.0|The book is amazing! I only read a bit at a time just to make the experience last as long as it can!
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Enjoy visiting old favorites and hearing the bands progression over a few years from soulful blues to rockin blues it is great.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This kept me reading though I'd really think a neurosurgeon would write better. It's structured well, alternating chapters with what was going on around the doctor and his history with the story and scenes in his head while he was in a coma. I did hope he would come back from heaven with something indisputable like a t-shirt or a coffee mug. But that's just me.
0785153942|3.0|I enjoyed the book greatly. I enjoyed the story. I expected the story to be longer however. I also hoped it would include more content on the Jaegers.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie is over the top visually stunning. The soundtrack from start to finish by M83 Susanne Sundfor is beyond perfect and hauntingly breathtaking. A Great movie for Tom Cruise. The Ukrainian-born actress Olga Konstantinovna Kurylenko as his real wife has the on screen chemistry that makes the movie perfect. A five star surprise. I wish that John Carter or Jupiter Ascending had been cast this well. I went back and changed my original rating from 4 to 5. I have also been playing the entire soundtrack and purchased the DVD. This is the movie that I watch over and over again. What a Classic Science Fiction Movie !
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Recommended by a friend who read most of it in a sitting, I found myself having a similar experience. I read most of it in a long weekend, only because I had other commitments. If allowed, I would have read this whole book at once. While I knew the premise going in, I was surprised at the way the story was told and how effectively it played out.
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|This is a beautiful figurine, but not much of a moving toy. The wings do move and the man can come off the back, but there is no other movement. My son is fine with that fact. He is very into knights, dragons and toys of this nature. The great thing is that I feel once he is done playing with it, it will be a nice show piece on a shelf. The craftsmanship is quite lovely.
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|written by my daughter, keep that in mind...lol<br />My 8 year old love's this game she calls the yellow guy cute little guy when I heard that I decided to play it myself and now I'm addicted
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I dont get these reveiwers saying this stylus is lousy. I have been using this one<br />every day for the past two weeks and it's holding up just fine. I would say you have to really<br />be beating it against your kindle to ruin the soft tip but I haven't had a problem so far.
0843175621|5.0|My daughter loves this book. Perfect size for a preschooler's hands. She also really enjoys the story. She first saw it on YouTube (the cartoon version from the 1970s) and is excited to also have the book.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love waking up to my own music.  It has alot of features and works at camp where I dont get wifi.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It sucks so bad that everyone hats it I do not like it haw animals eat their food and skiney
B0052UZIFA|5.0|One of the best games out there, in my opinion. Once you start playing, you can't stop! Super glad they finally released Plants vs. Zombies 2!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I found the book insightful and realistic of a federal womens' prison and the life and day to day happenings. It was interesting how the author was able to learn a skill an how it broke up her day.  The book also showed the differences in prison life from<br />a rural setting to a city prison where there was a mix population.<br /><br />I recommend it for a reader who has little to no experience in instituional living<br />or in incarceration reading.
1609611543|3.0|A real eye opener about the food we eat today.  If you are interested in your health I would recommend this book.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I was hooked from the beginning of the series and felt a need to own. Very clear version and I am happy to have bought it. Now to get the other 3 series
B002HLM4E0|5.0|My son and I are reading the entire series this school year, and after reading each book we are watching the corresponding film. We have both been impressed by the accuracy of the film to the book, the special effects, and the faithfulness of the characters to those in the book. We know that given the length of the books, it is very difficult to condense the stories into a film, but we feel that all of the most pertinent content was retained, and we love seeing what our mind's eye conjured up during our reading, displayed so well through the director's and actor's rendition of events in the film.
B0090SI582|5.0|My favorite of all the x-men related movies. Hugh Jackman is the man. Can't wait  or this to come out so I can watch it over and over. This movie is bad ass!!!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I though it was really good. The story tells a lot about tigers. I wish the story did not end.<br />DEANNA
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I pre ordered it a month before it shipped. Said I would be able to stream local files. That is false
0385523394|3.0|Not a bad book.It's well written and will keep your interest. Best suited for long plane flights, lay-overs at airports or time on the beach.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|My sister told me to watch this, and now I am totally hooked! Great series once you get to know the characters. So watch atleast three episodes before you make up your mind about this one!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Those who are already addicted to this delightful saga of British aristocracy, their servant class downstairs denizens and the social upheavals which eventually topple their cherished hierarchy will need no encouragement from me.  Those who have yet to savor the delights of Downton should start with season one and see what they're missing.<br /><br />This DVD set is a bargain- the cinematography is crisp, production values well preserved.  But I want to mention the service Amazon provided when my first order of Season 3 was discovered to have a factory defect making several episodes unplayable.<br /><br />I had purchased this DVD months earlier but had not gotten around to playing it until this summer.  When I discovered the defect in disc 2 I sent Amazon customer service one email.  Within a few hours they emailed me back to tell me not to send the defective DVD package back- they would simply overnight ship a replacement.  The very next day Fedex dropped off a new Season 3, which was defect-free.  The very next day!  One email.<br /><br />That's what I call good service!
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|I have listened to this many times. It's not John Williams  (that's not what I expected anyway) but it is one of the best soundtracks I've heard in recent years. The sound quality of the film in general is fantastic.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|Being someone who grew up watching Ricardo Montalban play Kahn, I was quite hesitant to give this Star Trek a go. I'm glad I did. Benedict Cumberbatch does an excellent job reinventing Kahn. His acting and that AMAZING voice really give Kahn the dangerous vibe that Kahn had in the Shatner Star Trek films.<br /><br />I do wish, there were more scenes with Klingons, but I have a feeling that their debut in this film is a foreshadow to their presence in future films.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I love Evangelion. These 'rebuilds' are masterworks. This is one of the best animes ever. I rate it up there with Miyazaki's best.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show. Great character development and incredible story telling.  One of the most addictive shows on television. I use my Roku and love it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such a great, engaging show. Actors/Actresses are great and the storyline is very interesting.<br />Anyone who likes shows such as Mad Men would enjoy this.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device packs a great punch and provides great quality streaming to your TV even though it has some shortcomings (though they will just get better over time)<br /><br />The biggest thing with this device is that you need to realize all the potentials that Google Chrome on your computer is capable of.<br />A great example is dragging a music or movie into your browser. Just by dragging, you are able to easily stream a movie directly from your computer to your TV because Chrome is HTML5.<br /><br />One &#34;hardship&#34; however is that there is still a lack of fully supported features for the device such as Hulu, etc. However, you can still watch them on your TV, you just have to watch to make sure there isn't a small lag in the sound/picture. If their is, you need to reset your browser.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoyed it very much. Felt like I was seeing the movie. I think I did pretty good for my first run.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love it! So much fun & addictive! I have a hard time putting the game down. I even got my friend addicted!
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I really needed I had no Idea. Now I am HOOKED!!!!!!!! first I was not sure but once I really looked at screen DAH!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's awesome. The acting is great, the storyline is intense and the costumes are impeccably created. It's a great drama.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I absolutely recommend this magical novel. It provides a unique escape into the heartbreaking world of a foster system womans life &#34;on the outside&#34; & her struggle to communicate with others.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I enjoy this app a lot. It's a no-brainer to use. The filters add effects to a photo to make it look like a pencil drawing or a washed-out watercolor, and a few others. It would be more useful on the Kindle Fire if the Fire had a backward-facing camera, but I've managed with just the front-facing one. I'm not even sure what I'll use the photos for, but the different effects just tickle the artist in me.<br /><br />Update: I should clarify that the effects are applied to photos you take using the app. You can't apply them later to a photo you've already taken.
B00003CXTF|3.0|Was a gift. Sent to a friend for Christmas so the said they liked to so I guess it's okay.
B000ID37RM|5.0|What a classic! This is a movie with a timeless message speaking to our humanity and integrity and the equal value of all people. We loved revisiting this and would highly recommend its viewing by all!
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|bravo pour le film d'horreur, quel remake, il était formidable, c'était incroyable, incroyable, incroyable, c'est rare de nos jours de voir ça  !
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill did a great job on the vocals,& Paul Franklin's steel guitar playing was truly great on both Buck Owens & Merle Haggards material. This Cd will get alot of play in this home.
0441018866|5.0|I picked this one up based on the stellar reviews. I've read a few by Reynolds in the past, the most recent being Absolution Gap which was a bit of a slog to get through in certain parts. But this one was exemplary from page one to the end. All loose ends are tied up very neatly and I definitely recommend it to lovers of harder sci-fi.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|interesting and fun in between break game at work. don't ever wanna put it down exspecially with the more difficult ones
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|So far so good.  Looking forward to getting a little further in the game.  Easy nav, looks great, and overall a good time.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Best series! Must read! I'm in love with Mac & Jericho! Love Karen Marie Moning for dreaming up the Fever world.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|There is nothing not too love about the NCIS experience and this was good viewing on each episode to me
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is absolutely fun and very affordable. I have to be honest and say that it will keep you on your toes. The only thing is that the text is a little bit small. But I am a grandma and my eyes are also older eyes. You will like it.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I'm not a &#34;gamer&#34;  just wanted something zto kill time waiting,  so far  looks good.  Downloaded and runs with no prob<br /><br />This reminds me of the old helicopter game and the fact that you collect coins adds that much more scoring interest.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|This book was a great read. Especially due to the fact that it was written from blog posts it takes on a different rhythm than a normal book.<br />As an entrepreneur I got a lot out of this book. If I was a new entrepreneur it would have been even more potent. However, even a seasoned business person like me found tremendous value from Mark Cuban's story and perspective. I recommend this book.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Open your way to focus on strategy and critical thinking. Excellent reading fully with valuable examples that keep you challenged.
B003NFM3JK|4.0|A Christmas Carol has always been one of my favorite Christmas stories.Disney did an awesome job with this and Jim Carey is great.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|This was a gift for an ex-boyfriend.  I hope he liked it, but I don't have any way of knowing.
B001E75QH0|5.0|I couldn't wait to get these movies I always catch them whn they play on tv now I can enjoy anytime I want and no commercials to interrupt!! Love it love it love it!!!
B00003W8NM|3.0|This was a gift for an ex-boyfriend.  I hope he liked it, but I don't have any way of knowing.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|There are far batter reviews on here than anything I could ever say, so I will just close with I loved this series so much I began watching the HBO TV series just because I wanted to see the characters played out. I highly recommend!
B0002J4ZWS|3.0|This was a gift for an ex-boyfriend.  I hope he liked it, but I don't have any way of knowing.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|enjoyed story line! pretty graphics and interesting idea...really enjoy the G5 games..cant beat the price either. Cant wait to try them all!
B0011HOEY4|3.0|This was a gift for an ex-boyfriend.  I hope he liked it, but I don't have any way of knowing.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I got this for my kids and they absolutely love it! And I get to secretly watch it with them too, Hehe!
859037985X|5.0|This is one of the printed gems that every software engineer should have.<br /><br />I would argue to read this book even if you do not work with Lua everyday (like me). This book covers many interesting areas about embedded languages in general: e.g. communication between garbage-collected languages vs non-garbage collected.<br /><br />It also has excellent cover for many interesting Lua features e.g. coroutines.<br /><br />I would compare this book with K&R C book. Both cover their languages but both these books are more than just manuals. They have its own spirit.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|I think I love these dolls almost as much as my daughter. The details are amazing. They are each so unique in coloring, clothing and overall style. My daughter is thrilled that the dolls in this series come with pets. She wishes she had pets for all the dolls. (Mattel - ever consider selling the pets on your website?) I managed to pick her up when she was in stock on Amazon, so I purchased her at a reasonable price. I'm saving this one for Christmas, but I'm sure that my daughter will be thrilled.
0446555002|5.0|I was disappointed at first when Helen died, but liked the ending to include his sons  which left room for another novel.
B000P407K4|5.0|It's important to remember that the issues dealt with in this 1964 movie are still relevant. For some reason, we ignore them, but the risks are real.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|Was expecting a better book, more like his later books but that makes sense - his first HH book.  Looking forward to his newest one.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I purchased this item for a gift, we listened to the C.D have to say it is fantastic, we liked all the songs on there.  For all fans of Mumford & Sons this C.D will not disappoint.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Cant ask for more, Brilliant offer. for a beautiful game thats proven to entertain all ages. Nice work appreciate the contribution
B001OMJGD0|4.0|Perhaps an important reason this movie didn't do so well at the time was that it really is very much like the Christopher Reeves movies, or at least like the first two, though considerably better. And being like a late 70s or early 80s film just wasn't what 2006 was looking for. But from the standpoint of renting an older movie, then that hardly matters and it can be viewed in its own light. It's a good movie. Brandon Routh does a fine job, the visuals of him are excellent, the other special effects are perfectly good, and the plot though nothing to write home about is okay and at least as good as any of the Christopher Reeve movies.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|amazing, cool, awesome graphics. Music is nice as well. I just wished the main characters spoke when speaking. that should add a nice touch to the game.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Despite only airing for a few episodes this show has already gone down in history as a SciFi classic. Joining the ranks of Star Trek and Battle Star Galactica but with a western twist.
B003VANOFY|4.0|When I bought my Logitch G930 I was going in with some skepticism because a lot of people have loved this thing, and a lot of other people have had countless issues with it. However I was a little tight on funds and the G930 was a hundred bucks even so I went with it over some of the other wireless headsets in its price range. I am going to give you a rundown of what I have experienced owning this headset for the last month or so in hopes of giving you an idea whether or not this is the product you are looking for.<br /><br />When you are mailed this headset you should be expecting all its components that you payed for, and have them in working order. When I was mailed this headset I was happy with how fast I got it, and the packaging reassured me it wasn't going to break on the way here. However, I discovered the software disk for the headset was missing, and I was pretty niffed. If you happen to get this headset and the disk isn't included, rest assured you can go to Logitech's website and simply download the software from there instead.<br /><br />The headset comes in three parts. There is the headset itself, a usb station that plugs into your computer which charges the headset, and a usb that gives off the wireless signal that plugs into the station. The fact that the usb drive for the wireless signal and the station it has to be plugged into were separate components bothered me. It just didn't make much sense to have the extra component and not just one station with the wireless drive built into it. It wasn't too much of an inconvenience though.<br /><br />Once I got all the software installed, which was very simple, and got the product registered with Logitech I was on my way. The sound was great, and the surround sound was decent enough. You can't give Logitech much flak for not perfecting a 7.1 surround sound headset when no other peripheral has done it, but the sound was acceptable (If you are an audiophile you will not be dissapointed with this headsets audio quality). I recommend turning down the default settings for the speakers within the headset to ten instead of eleven. The default setting causes the base to clip (This is just because its too damn loud). The software also comes with a graphic equalizer you can use to adjust the quality of your playback if you are a little more advanced with that kind of thing. I did have some qualms with the microphone quality though. It is really mediocre. Granted its a gaming headset and you just have to be audible for your teammates to understand you, for the price, they could have done a better job with it. If you are looking for a high quality mic with this headset, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The Macros are there and are easy to set up using the software you will either install online or using the disk that came with the product. I don't use them myself but I don't want to leave them out of the review. There are three of them on the upper side of the left ear-cup. They are above the volume wheel and mute button. You can either use the mute button to mute your mic, or you can tilt your mic up and down to mute and unmute it. The mic is muted in the up position and unmuted in the down position. The battery for this headset does not last more than three to five hours at a time before it needs to be recharged.<br /><br />The wireless signal is not very strong. You can walk around your room, and maybe to your bathroom, but I estimate the range on the G930 is somewhere around fifteen feet. However, it does its job if you are wanting a wireless headset for the same reasons I wanted one. I want to be able to stand up when I want, lean back, and twirl in my chair without ripping out cords. I can't say much for how sturdy the thing is. It probably can't take much of a beating, but you should try and not drop your headset if you can. That usually makes them last a little longer. It is very comfortable though! It is adjustable and the noise-cancelling works wonders.<br /><br />I have had some issues. You MUST plug this into a usb that will feed enough power into the station for the headsets wireless signal. If you do not, your headset will lose connectivity very often. Every now and again your headset will make a loud buzzing noise for several seconds before shutting down. This is due to the fact the headset randomly loses its connection with the station. This doesn't happen too often, but it does happen. To fix this you must turn of your headset and unplug the station and usb drive. Plug everything back in and hold the power button on the G930 for 10 seconds and it should be in working order again. I ahve not had any other issues with this headset other than those above.<br /><br />So as a little recap of sorts...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Very comfortable<br />- Noise cancelling works<br />- Very High Audio Quality (Solid Surround Sound)<br />- Customization (Equalizer, Macros, Surround sound)<br />- Easy to use software<br />- Moveable mic<br />- Volume wheel<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Wireless range is only good up to fifteen feet<br />- Mediocre mic quality<br />- Requires a good sum of power from your PC (Plug directly into motherboard USB)<br />- Following a very loud buzzing noise it will randomly disconnect from the station<br /><br />I hope this review helps you decide on whether or not this product is for you. I Highly recommend using Google to compare several other headsets in the G930's price range before making a purchase. An educated purchase is the best kind of purchase.d some issues.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Title says it all.  The Apple TV is far and beyond the better product.  Even at $35, the chromecast is a waste of money...and, especially, time.  The chromecast is for you If you like inconvenience, poor implementation (if at all), and a device that rarely works the way you'd expect.  If you like to enjoy your phone's content without complication, get the Apple TV.  The Apple TV is far and beyond the better of the two products.
0529064847|4.0|I chose this rating because this bible was an economical purchase, handy size, and easily readable print.  I like being able to compare this with other translations for further clarity.  I would recommend this translation to other bible readers, even though, I an not Catholic.

B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I think Tina is funny, at least doing improv, so I was very disappointed that this book just wasn't that funny. There were some cute stories here and there, and it was interesting to hear about how the Sarah Palin bit came about, but otherwise, just not really funny.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|Amazing animation/graphics specially if you are watching the Blu-ray version, great story. Very original characters. Enjoyable for children and adults no doubt.

B001KT6JPA|4.0|good but creepy!!! The end is crazy.. Great scary movie if you are in the mood for a scary one.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite series. I am so grateful that Amazon Prime made this available. The series is loosely based on Flora Thompson's book of the same name. While I've never read the entire book (I have an abridged, illustrated copy I bought used through Amazon years ago), the series is so well done that I imagine the characters must have been drawn from the book. Besides becoming attached to the characters (some more endearing and others outright annoying, just as in real life) and the various story lines, this is aesthetically very pleasing due to the beautiful photography. If you enjoy this series, you ought to watch &#34;Cranford&#34; and &#34;Return to Cranford&#34; (also offered to Prime members) too.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great packaging. Takes up less room on the shelf than all the individual cases. We love it and have watched them all many times already! Great price too :)

006114665X|3.0|Debate over blame for the outbreak of war in 1914 began even before the war ended and has probably been one of the most contentious ongoing arguments in historical writing.  Mainstream consensus has shifted several times--often out of a desire to make a current political point using a particular view of national responsibility for the war.  First, it was mostly Germany's fault (outside of Germany, of course).  By the early '30's it was nobody's fault. By the '60's it was back to Germany again.  Clark's book may represent the climax of the current trend: fault was equal and it was everywhere.<br /><br />There is much to like about this book: it is extremely well researched and written.  Clark is obviously an intelligent expert in this field.  The exploration of internal national politics preceding the war in Germany, Serbia, Austria, Great Britain, and France is excellent.  Moreover, the analysis of where power actually lay within each country and how it was exercised is very good.<br /><br />That said, there is, in my view, an inclination to distort the evidence to support Clark's thesis that there was a lot of blame and it was equally apportioned between the various nations.  A good example is Clark's discussion of the Serbian response to the Austrian ultimatum. Clark is quite right to point out that the often stated assertion that Serbia almost completely accepted Austria's demands is not true.  On the other hand, the Serbian response, although not intended as such, was hardly a hostile one and could have been the basis for a non-military resolution of Austria's legitimate grievances had Austria had any desire to do so.<br /><br />Clark dismisses this Austrian option out of hand by essentially saying that international organizations were not as robust in 1914 as today, the Serbs were  duplicitous, and a number of other reasons.  I find this dismissal unconvincing. Coupled with Grey's offer of an international conference, the Serbia response would seem to have presented a sound opportunity for a diplomatic solution that in addition to the growing evidence of involvement of Serbian officials in the assassination can not be as easily dismissed as Clark does.  Why does Clark almost give the Austrians and the Germans a pass on this? Why, for example, doesn't he tell us that Apis, the Serb official at the center of the conspiracy, was executed by the Serbian government, albeit for other reasons, during the ensuing war? This fact, of course, would tend to downplay official Serbian complicity other than in isolated areas of the government.<br /><br />Another example of Clark's pursuit of his thesis is his brief and unconvincing dismissal of the German naval build up as responsible for alienating Britain and pushing it into a de facto alliance with France. Many others have written extensively on how it did just that.  Again I find Clark's truncated dismissal unconvincing.  I wonder what the German response would have been if  Britain had built its army from almost nothing to half a million men and trained it on the plains of northern France?  Surely this would have been a comparable British policy and, if it had occurred, it certainly would not be in keeping with the overall thrust of Clark's book to think he would be dismissing its effects in a few pages.<br /><br />Churchill's position, derided by many Germans at the time, that their greatly expanded navy was a luxury rather than a necessity holds up well.  Surely the surface fleet's complete inability to do anything of substance to assist the nation in the war is the final proof.  It was an aggressive luxury that began the road to war.<br /><br />In connection with his dismissal of the importance of the pointless, aggressive and self-defeating German naval buildup, it is also telling how Clark handles the issue of the Kaiser's power and behavior prior to the First World War. Clark tries to dismiss him as more or less an erratic incompetent who did not really have much consistent influence over policy. Of course this downplays, for Clark, extremely aggressive and conflict prompting behavior by the German leader for some two decades prior to the outbreak of war.<br /><br />While there is some truth in this, the Kaiser was inconsistent and his influence did wane over time, the Kaiser's influence was predominate and consistent in the naval build up that did so much to alienate the British and provide the basis, along with the violation of Belgium's neutrality, for their united and decisive entry into the war.  Clark completely ignores this.<br /><br />Really one could get to the end of Clark's book and, if you are not careful, you might forget that there was one alliance that started military action (shelling Belgrade and invading two neutral countries, Belgium and Luxemburg) and one that moved its troops 10K back from the Belgium border.  That there was one country, Germany, that invaded those two neutral countries and  declared war against Russia and France before any nation had taken military action against it or declared war on it. These seem to me to be some pretty basic points to take into account when apportioning blame. Essential facts that Clark does his best to obscure.<br /><br />So why the tendency to pursue thesis over fact? I do not know Clark, have not heard him speak and have not read his other work so I can only speculate.  My speculation is that Clark might, for him, be uncomfortably like Fischer the author of total German and Austria culpability in the '60's who Clark so convincingly and effectively criticizes.  Fischer was, it seems, driven by his desire to address German culpability in the Second World War and it shaped his view of the evidence regarding culpability for the first.  Similarly there are hints in the book that Clark's present day political agenda shapes his view and presentation of the evidence.  Speculating, I would guess that agenda includes strong support for the euro and the EU.  Given increasing German domination of both the euro and the EU and the Germanphobia that the current problems with both seem to be promoting, it is certainly more comfortable and convenient for strong supporters of both institutions to have blame for the First World War be more or less equally apportioned and aided and abetted by the absence of powerful European international institutions as we approach the 100th anniversary of its beginning.  Added to this would be the barely concealed desire to promote another, earlier, multi-ethnic supranational governmental structure (Austria-Hungry) as far as the facts permit.<br /><br />In my view, there was a lot of fault to go around.  Many powerful people in France were looking for an opportunity for a successful chance for military revenge and gave their own version of a blank check to Russia.  The Serbs were aggressive and duplicitous and part of the government was directly responsible for the assassination. Parts of the Russian government egged Serbia on and ignored legitimate Austrian grievances. Grey did disingenuously put Britain in a duplicitous de facto alliance with France and for him and many others with power in Britain violation of Belgium neutrality was not necessary for Britain to enter the war. However, the basic fact is that France, Russia and Britain were not prepared to start a general European war and Germany was and did.  It is a basic fact that, after almost 600 pages and almost a 100 years, Clark can not erase.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was better than I expected and wasn't as dark as some of the hype made it out to be.  Recommended read.
B000OLROWC|5.0|And my kids, who saw the Jaden Smith version first, agree!  Just the way Ralph Macchio fights at the very end sends gooseflesh all over!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read this book in a day.  It was a good follow up to the first book and not what I expected.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This is mandatory if you have children.  Traditional values, fun, and JA is awesome, what a great voice!  The mom and dad, are great actors, just saw a movie that they were both I as very young actors, it was on netflix &#34;Miranda&#34; she is a mermaid and he is a suitor.
B00BOXZAJ8|5.0|A great movie...beautiful and unique. The acting is believable, the plot is fun and different. I am recommending this movie to all my friends!
B0055B7IPE|4.0|Pros - High Quality Animation, Likable Cast, imaginative and fairly well put together<br /><br />Cons - Some things plot wise are face palmingly bad. They make you want to groan, and you wonder why they put them in the movie.<br /><br />Like a certain character acting like an action hero (which was totally out of character)<br /><br />Overall it's an enjoyable movie, and some parts are particularly touching
B00BV5FVR0|4.0|very good read, however you must read atwoods first two books before this one or you will never be able to follow the story! strongly recommend reading all three starting with the flood
B00A2KJ3KG|5.0|Life of Pi is one of those rare books that changes forever your outlook on life when you read it. It's one of those rare books that entertain you, captivate you, enthrall you, and cause you to think...all at the same time! Life of Pi is one of those books so original it forces you to raise your standards in fiction. Life of Pi reconfirmed my belief both in stories and in the power of the human spirit. It is both one of my all-time favourite books, and one of the most enduring books of the 21st Century. My highest praise is not even enough.<br /><br />But let me tell you this: it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. Hearing the hype in early 2012, both for the upcoming movie adaptation and the book, I decided to read Life of Pi. I could not.<br /><br />The book seemed unbelievably dense, like something you had to read for school in 10th grade, just psychological musings, religious debates, and something thrown in about a tiger. Or a zebra or something. I gave up 10 percent through the book. Or rather eBook, since I read it on my Kindle.<br /><br />Then I saw Ang Lee's movie of the same name. It was incredible, absolutely magical. Stunning cinematography and groundbreaking CGI melded seamlessly with incredible acting, heart, humour, and brilliant thought-provoking subjects such as truth and fiction, God and religion, etc to make a truly amazing cinematic event. It was deservedly a huge success at the box office, sweeping the Oscars and winning over the critics. In my original film review of Life of Pi, I gave it 5 stars, calling it \\"even better then the book.\\"<br /><br />Had I even read the entire book? No. Several weeks after I saw the film I came across the Life of Pi paperback in my local library. I checked it out, and set myself to reading it. To my surprise, the book captured me from the start. There is power in books - the smell, the touch, the grain of the paper, and the black of the ink, the heft of the paper - to read a good book in actual _book form is to enter another reality, as if holding the tome in your hands is some proof of the story's existence.<br /><br />I fell in love with Life of Pi halfway through. The color and detail, the action and drama, the heart, the humour, the compelling characters, the gritty realism, the danger, the animals, and that most relateable and singular of protagonists - Piscine Molitor Patel (named after a French swimming pool, born in Pondicherry, India, orphaned in the Pacific Ocean).<br />By the end, I was enthralled. I found the movie was only _half the story. There was so much more, and the book was so much better! The strange story of a scrawny Indian boy castaway in the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat, with a Bengal Tiger, and briefly, a Zebra, a Hyena, and an Orangutan renewed my belief in the power of fiction. Yann Martel's way with words is stunning, and the pictures he paints in your mind will stay there as if burned by a redhot brand.<br /><br />The details he uses to portray scenes of incredible magnitude, horror, awe, and beauty is unparalleled in recent years. The parables he tells are a lost form of storytelling. The realism and factualism he puts into his work must be a product of countless hours of research, but it comes across as seamless. Overwhelming is a mild way to put it.<br /><br />But what of the book's ultimate boast? Will Life of Pi make you believe in God? Probably not, though I _have heard of such testimonies.<br /><br />But one thing is certain. Life of Pi will make you believe in the power of books. This is a work of incalculable beauty and colour, originality and power, that, if you are more open than the average reader, will take you on an incredible journey that you never want to end. A journey of hope, overcoming fears, finding God, openmindedness, life, death, animals, man, and finding your true self, which for one resourceful Indian boy, took a little more than he expected.<br /><br />My rating? Five Richard Parkers out of Five.<br /><br />P.S. Check out the excellent film of the same name. Kudos to Ang Lee for doing the impossible and adapting Yann's book.<br />P.P.S. Check out Yann Martel's second novel, Beatrice and Virgil: A Novel, the divisive but brilliant story within a story about a howler monkey and a donkey on an epic adventure. Cheers!he excellent film of the same name. Kudos to Ang Lee for doing the impossible and adapting Yann's book.<br />P.P.S.

B00A285OOW|5.0|Not only based on historic facts (although taking advantage where there is doubt about the true facts), it actually uses a lot of phrases and terms that are deemed archaic nowadays, but that were in use at the time when the story is supposed to happen.
B003KGBISY|5.0|What is an Akira Kurosawa film? It's not just a film.<br /><br />It's a cause for celebration. Its excuse enough to stop whatever you are doing and be engrossed in a mind-blowing, riveting experience piece of cinema that surpasses the best modern cinema has to offer.<br /><br />Akira Kurosawa ranks with Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg (a filmmaker highly influenced by him) on any list of great directors, for sheer enduring power of his films, and the fact that he has influenced almost every major director after him.<br />Kurosawa's attention to detail, historical accuracy, brilliant cinematography, and film characters prove that he was a true master of the art. Kurosawa's eye for action is not to be understated, as the climactic battle in Seven Samurai is one of the most riveting and action-packed ever captured to film. But Kurosawa did not neglect the human element, and Seven Samurai rings true with human drama and emotion.<br /><br />All his best films (excluding Ran) were collaborations with Toshiro Mifune. And what an actor he was! He had a screen presence so large and intense that when he came on the screen there was nothing you could do but stare in awe, amusement, or respect.<br /><br />And Seven Samurai is both Kurosawa's and Mifune's magnum opus. It is a masterpiece.
0307476073|4.0|Our book club chose this because we seldom seem to choose non-fiction. I was truly surprised by how much I liked this book as I am not particularly athletic. The author has a gift for description and for saying just what is in her mind.I could understand her reasons for the journey, and I could easily picture what she was going through because of her vivid descriptions. This is a good read for anyone.
B00003CX5P|3.0|The Phantom Menace gets a lot of bad hype that it doesn't actually deserve. Sure the special effects were poor and overabundant - poorer in fact than the original trilogy, and yes &#34;Ani&#34; was annoying, not to mention that CGI horror....Jar Jar Binks! I can go on, and on, and on about what went wrong with Phantom Menace (an endless task). But really, why not focus on the positive?<br /><br />Let's not forget the awesome Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, one of the greatest and most compelling characters in the prequel trilogy. And let's not forget that most badass of Sith fighters, Darth Maul. Let's not forget that battle in the arena. And the greatest lightsaber battle since a certain Darth Vader battled it out with Luke in Empire.<br /><br />What makes The Phantom Menace shine, however, is its straightforward, simple plot, and it's jubilant childish sense of fun. And the fact that it doesn't star Hayden Christensen. The Phantom Menace is more light-hearted and fun than either Attack of the Clones or Revenge of the Sith, and it's also more enjoyable to watch. Let's just forget that Jar Jar ever happened, shall we?
B005I7G3EM|5.0|One of John Wayne best movies. Not a western or war movie. I have watch it many time. Has a good story line and great actors. A very good movie to watch with the whole family rated G with very mile violence.

B00BH0VSM6|5.0|An excellent suspenseful detective story that introduces Harry Hole.  I read these in the wrong order since this one recently became available, but clearly Jo Nesbo put together an oustanding story right from the start.

0062073508|5.0|This book was unbelievably intriguing. You never know what is going to happen next. In this book I always wanted to read more. Agatha Christie has written some of the best mysteries and this one is my personal favorite. If you read this book you will never be able to put it down because she always has you hooked.

B0013KTGAG|4.0|Rented this movie on a whim. Was not disappointed. Good Sci-fi movie with great visuals and a good action line. Chris Evans is a favorite and he did not disappoint. Would recommend this movie for a light hearted afternoon.
B003WE9TU8|3.0|An interesting take on the zombie genre. This read really focuses on the human experience. Not so much a thrilling zombie gore fest....more of a historians view of a world overrun by the living dead.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I agree with most people that this movie wasn't done to its fullest potential. It did lack a lot of depth. The emotion was there only to an extent and for some reason it felt limited. I liked all the actors, Saoirse Ronan is a personal favorite of mine. Regardless I think the role of Melanie would have been better portrayed by an older actress. That being said the story itself was very captivating and beautiful. I was never bored and It held up well all the way up to the end. Overall I did enjoy this movie.
B003WE9WRI|3.0|Interestingly I'd been watching The Walking Dead recently and found myself contemplating how I would react to a full scale zombie apocalypse. Max Brooks has obviously thought this through and provides a detailed How To guide for surviving the hordes of ghouls. Written like a real Survival Guide its hard not to think it is taking the piss a bit. But a reasonably entertaining read none the less.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|Didn't care for the movie at all. Nothing like Judge Dredd with Stylone! Cannot recommend this movie to any adult!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I started playing this and ended up playing for an hour. Even though I couldn't remember all the wild cards from the tutorial.<br /><br />Not sure where the ads are, but maybe they dropped that? I didn't run into the issue. But I just played the game, didn't go looking for stuff. And NO adware warnings from TrustGo, a nice change from most FAOTD games lately.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|This sequel is what the first film should have been. Less dialogue, more action. Plus, like any good sequel, the action is revved up and there are way more faces from the past!
0143122916|5.0|The life story of somebody born in a N. Korean prison camp and his adventures during and after escaping. Probably one of the saddest things I have ever read. Lucky to even be alive after so many years of abuse and torture there, he escaped and now has devoted the rest of his life to helping the remaining people confined there and being horribly abused. I could not put this book down and kept reading, hoping things for him would improve greatly. I won't spoil the story for those of you who have not read it, but I will only tell you that this book changed my life. I know I will never complain about anything in my life ever again. Shin, thank you for telling your story and being so caring and outspoken for the people left there now. This is a chilling story, so be prepared for the worst. Hard to imagine anybody could make it through this. I now know how really lucky I am.

B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Subplots and lingering questions about all the characters but leaves you answering them with the banality of life's many turns and the  bad choices we make.Tom the neighbor intrigued me. Mud called him assassin, then Tom revealed he was a sharpshooter. I have to go back and watch the old photographs on the wall at tom's place again. And his shooting at the dock. And mud saying he was on the CIA payroll and Cuba and 1963, JFK assassinated on the same year. Fifty year anniversary this year. Thoroughly enjoyed this film.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|This movie is genuinely inept. It's so full of stupid, implausible scenes, you can hardly tell what's going most of the time. Jack Reacher is being chased by the cops, and a crowd of city folk automatically helps him hide for no reason. The cops are talking about how the arrested guy will only talk to one guy--Jack Reacher--and the secretary comes in and says, 'There's a Jack Reacher here to see you!' So bad. The only funny part was when Tom Cruise takes off his shirt, and the pretty DA is supposed to act like she's about ready to faint from desire. Cruise is a pretty fit 50 year old, but he's still 50 years old, and there's no way this pretty girl 20 years his junior would be turned on by his weird, shaven, skinny armed 50 year old bod. He looks like a freak. I recommend you rent something from the 80s, when they still knew how to make action movies.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|As a fan of the BBC version of the updated Sherlock Holmes, I was very pleasantly surprised by the &#34;American&#34; version of the same character (s).  Clearly the writers put a different twist on the famous duo, but it works well.  The appeal is in the character of Sherlock himself.  He is a fictional personality, and given that he knows a myriad of facts, is not just well-read, but virtually is a &#34;super&#34; intellect and truly fascinating.  His egocentricity and slightly narcissistic qualities make him endearing if not annoying.  Joan Watson manages him well with maturity and compassion.  They have overall done a splendid job of providing stimulating and fascinating stories and the human element is handled delicately and kindly.  Well done!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good story line.  Just finished it a little too quickly.  Mini games were challenging. I liked the option of the card game or the object search.

B00AHHODH2|3.0|A 3.5* rating.<br /><br />The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club is a satirical mystery novel, with elements of dark comedy, set in Savannah, Georgia. It is a fun and pleasant read that certainly had me smiling and laughing. As one reviewer so aptly described it: \\"I felt like I was on the set of Desperate Housewives with Cesar Millan while reading an Agatha Christie mystery\\". So true!<br /><br />Secrets abound in the tiny neighbourhood of Gordonston, an affluent neighbourhood outside Savannah. The four members of the Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club have been meeting for the last ten years in the local park. While their dogs romp and play, they share cocktails and the latest gossip. When one of their members passes away from throat cancer, we start to see the secrets that the other three members have been concealing. In addition to the ladies we also meet several neighbours that use the dog park and learn that all is not as it seems. With distrust and suspicion, friendships slowly unravel and paranoia sets in. One thing is for certain: the residents of Gordonston will do anything to protect their secrets even if it means murder!<br /><br />Duncan Whitehead has brought us a strangely suspenseful tale with a delightful eclectic cast of characters. Red herrings and twisted theories keep us guessing as we try to remove the masks surrounding these characters through events in time. With a tongue in cheek sense of the absurdities of suburban living, satire is intermingled throughout the story, adding to the reader's enjoyment of the characters and the plots that are set against them.<br /><br />So why a 3.5* rating? It is unfortunate that I read this book after reading two tightly woven mysteries by new authors. I was particularly frustrated with the loose editing and proof reading of The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club and this impacted the flow of the story and resulted in loss of concentration. Along with typographical, grammatical and content errors, there were several repeated facts and chapters (chapters 1 and 18 were verbatim) that were, in my view, not necessary for the reader.<br /><br />Overall I did enjoy this book and recommend it. It is a hilarious cosy murder mystery with a kick. I understand that a sequel is due for release and I will continue to follow this saga of intrigue, deceit, and vengeance.

B007G92QGO|5.0|If you have ever found yourself asking \\"why do people do what they do?\\", \\"what shapes us?\\", or \\"what encourages good behaviour in some and bad in others?\\" then this book is for you.<br /><br />Andy Barber is a trusted senior prosecutor, the District Attorney's right hand and master trial lawyer. When a teenage boy is found dead in the woods near Barber's home, he takes on the investigation, as he has countless homicides before. Then in a frightening turn of events, Barber's own 14-year-old son, Jacob, is accused of the murder. The boy insists he is innocent, and Barber rallies to his son's defense - as any father would, he thinks, as any father must. But defending Jacob exacts a terrible price; friends start to fall away. Jacob's classmates start to incriminate. and Barber's marriage begins to crumble as his wife Laurie buckles under the relentless pressure of suspicion. Finally, as Jacob's trial intensifies, Barber faces a trial of his own, in which he is forced to confront his own secret history, a past he thought he'd buried long ago.<br /><br />This book is about an embattled family in crisis - a suspenseful, character-driven mystery/thriller that is also a spellbinding tale of guilt, betrayal, and the terrifying speed at which our lives can spin out of control.<br /><br />The ability to create original and surprising plots is not evenly bestowed on writers. Far too often readers see what's coming a mile away. But I devoured this novel; it is one that provided an ending as brilliant and as shocking as any I can recall. The ending is utterly unpredictable, and one that is all too real, all too painful, all too haunting.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is an intelligent and thought provoking read that raises incredibly difficult and complex issues. The pace is excellent and the points made on each side of the case will keep your brain churning long after you've finished reading.
B004IK30S2|5.0|ive seen this movie prob 20x and its still funny everytime.  ferrell and the rest of the cast kill it on this..
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Historical fact is the heart of great historical fiction but like quicksand, it can suck you down if you stay too long. This did NOT happen with Sebastian. The historical facts were so seamlessly tied in to the story that I knew exactly where I was and who I was with, thus experiencing a deeper look at the human experience.<br /><br />Sebastian is a book to luxuriate in; a book to savor. With the poetic language of the novel, and the world painted by those words, I became utterly unconscious of the process of reading and instead was carried into the world of the story and the hearts and minds of the characters. I wanted to stay there forever. This is just how I felt when I first fell in love with reading.<br /><br />Fischer's narrative is superb; prose that is scrupulous and lyrical, beautiful and exact. The only complaint I have about the story is that it had to finish.<br /><br />This is a MUST read. INTELLIGENT, SENSITIVE, ENGAGING, PERFECT.<br /><br />A synopsis of the story and a little bit of history about the Austro-Hungarian empire, is contained below for those who wish to read further....<br /><br />Synopsis<br />Sebastian is set in Vienna in the early 1910's in the time of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Sebastian is the story of a young man who has to come to terms with the amputation of his leg just before World War I. When his father is drafted to fight he has to step up and manage the family grocery store through the hard times, bad fortunes and changes of personnel. Vienna is the capital of a multi-cultural and multi-religious, liberal society that is on the verge of collapsing into several split nations, a development accelerated by the war. Against this backdrop Sebastian is finding himself and his own place in life.<br /><br />Sebastian is the second book in 'The Three Nations Trilogy' and the only one I have read to date (that's going to change as soon as I have finished this review!). The Trilogy is not written in chronological order nor linked viathe characters or plot connections. According to various interviews with the author, The Trilogy is an attempt to illustrate themes of family, ethnicity and the concept of Nations in three very different yet similar times and settings in Central Europe.<br /><br />Brief History<br />The Austro-Hungarian empire began in 1867 with the Ausgleich - the \\"Compromise\\" - that saw the old Austrian and Hapsburg empire transformed into a new Austria-Hungary, a hybrid empire with a dual monarchy whose imperial life ended in 1918 with defeat in the first world war. Austria-Hungary contained many other countries and ethnic groups and 11 recognised languages. This curious amalgam of peoples included Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Ukrainians, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Romanians and Italians. For the duration of its existence its emperor was Franz Joseph I. He reigned for nearly 68 years, dying in 1916 at the age of 86.

B004ZRV3AU|3.0|I'm still fine-tuning my method for actually getting the class to break on my cut line, but as far as actually cutting the glass, this bottle cutter does its job. The handle for the cutter is a little cumbersome and I had a hard time cutting the bottles the way described in the instructions for the tool. I found it easier to hold the cutter against the glass and spin the bottle around to make the cut. (That is holding the bottle horizontally v. holding it vertically as per the instructions.) Overall, it's an OK product.

B00ESY7QXI|5.0|When the movie was released, I didn't want to see it for fear of what Hollywood would do to such an iconic story by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  I couldn't have been more WRONG.<br /><br />It followed the story as I see it in my head--over-the-top decadence, alcoholism, infidelity, love, missed opportunities, and loathing. I was thrilled with the modern soundtrack, the sets, the costumes, the camera shots--all the glitz and glamour the story deserves.<br /><br />I will watch this movie again and again ...

B00DT99BX6|4.0|Pawn of Innocence is a love story of an unlikely pair brought about through recklessness and realization. Camile is young, beautiful and rich, well her father is, and because of circumstances that happened when she was a child, she must constantly be surrounded by bodyguards. Camile wants to escape her \\"prison\\" and be able to go about on her own, even when she finds out the truth behind the need for her protection. But what she doesn't know is she can't get away from her father's watchful eye, and maybe, she realizes, she doesn't want to.<br /><br />Chameleon has written a love story that takes the reader to exotic lands, beautiful snowy mountains and the ancient lands of the Middle East. It will give you pause, makes you laugh and, it'll make you feel all warm inside as this romance unfolds. The chapters are long, and the storyline sometimes not plausible, but it is endearing. The characters are good, especially Nikki, whose sense of humor was great fun. The Sight and Sound instituted in the book I felt was unnecessary, after all shouldn't the author paint the picture?<br /><br />I am not one for romance stories but I would read another book by this author. And so should you.

B0046B1KHG|4.0|This is a product review, not a movie review. Since I bought the movie in this form, obviously, I like it....5 stars. Totally biased, no reasoning, just personal preference as it should be for any movie.<br />This is about the download version only.  It allowed me to put it on my Kindle 8.9&#34;  so I can watch wherever, whenever I want. The picture is great, crisp and clear. The sound is in stereo - something that was really missing on my Kindle Fire. Both were actually much better when I streamed to my computer, but that's to be expected with the larger screen and better speakers. There were no glitches on the download and the streaming was flawless with no loading interruptions.<br />Sounds great right? Then why only 4 stars? Because I have unlimited streaming, but can only download it 2 times. What happens if I get the next great phone or tablet and want to put it on both of those? Suppose my Kindle dies and I have to get a new one, do I only watch streaming at a hot spot? The 2 downloads should be increased to at least 4.<br />Overall a great product, I just wish Amazon would rethink their download limit.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|This music gets you singing and dancing. I listen to this alot in my car and I enjoy it. I bought this cd because I liked a couple of songs.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I tried Touchpal, Swype and some other ones that I can't remember.  All were pretty mediocre compared to SwiftKey. Also, SwiftKey allows you to use the google voice for texting without having to select it, or having to select the sentence you just spoke.  The other apps would give an option of a sentence you spoke, which was rather annoying as it required you to select the sentence, then hit the send button.  Isn't the point of voice recognition to minimize having to press additional keys?<br /><br />I really can't think of any down sides to SwiftKey. It still makes mistakes when you swipe.  All the other keyboards did too.

As well the young boy who played his son. I was touched deeply and will be watching it again soon.<br /><br />I had to turn the volume up 3/4% to full for me to hear it.. One star off for that.<br />Not sure why they would record a movie so low.<br /><br />Buy it.. It's worth turning up your tv to hear it.. I am moved beyond words...

I am much more interested in the historical facts regarding the most important people of our times and times past....this book more than met my expectations.

B00D8HNR5W|5.0|Nine Inch Nails are one of the few more hardcore bands that manage to stay relevant and greatly artistic at the same time.  I admit after the release of \\"The Slip\\" and the Ghosts, I thought NIN were done with making full albums.  Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross started doing musical scores for movies which were amazing, earning them an Oscar win that was well deserved.  But in their absense from NIN music I started listening to all kinds of other types of music.  I even started listening to more calm bands and even some poppy indie bands.  I also ventured into some Hip Hop since then and I don't regret that.  This album can be seen as a comeback because \\"The Slip\\", though a full length album, was released for free as a gift to fans.  But Trent did release the album physically for those who wanted to actually own the album.  That album was great, but still didn't feel like a REAL NIN album just because of its release method.  Also around that time the \\"Ghosts\\" were gradually released the same way and though they were haunting and beautiful instrumentals, I wanted something more.  So there was an absence for 5 years before I finally heard that NIN were releasing a new album in the traditional manner and on a major label again.  Not that the label matters, but it just felt more official to me!  The release of the lead single \\"Came Back Haunted\\" was a welcoming sound to my ears.  I haven't heard hard rock/industrial sounds this good in years.  Then the albums title was released.  It had the same edgy dark theme as \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and I couldn't wait.  Now it's finally here!  It was well worth the wait and money.  Here is a track by track review.<br /><br />1. The Eater of Dreams:  Short but haunting instrumental intro.  Its okay for me, but I've had enough instrumentals after the Ghosts.  It does lead into the next track well though.  6.5/10<br />2. Copy of A:  At first when this was released as a second single I thought it was just okay.  This song features more ofthe electronic sounds from \\"Year Zero\\" and Trents excellent movie scores.  The chorus gets better with each listen.  The second verse has some industrial background sounds similar to the \\"Downward Spiral\\" and its just great.  9.5/10<br />3. Came Back Haunted:  The comeback single.  This is definitely one of the best NIN songs hands down.  Its a shame it wasn't as commercially successful as some of NINs previous singles, but oh well.  Still great.  Pumping beats, addictive chorus and perfect industrial sounds!  One of NINs best dance rocker songs.  I have to say this.  After all those Ghosts, its no surprise Trent came back haunted.  (haha).  10/10<br />4. Find My Way:  The album slows down with this hauntingly beautiful industrial ballad.  The song, like a lot of NINs best, builds upon itself to the somewhat climatic end.  The piano featured in the song is simple yet addictive!  9/10<br />5. All Time Low:  This has got to be one of my new favorite NIN tracks.  It has this groovy feel to it.  If it were up to me, this would be the next single.  There is even a soulful influence in Trents voice.  He delivers a perfect falsetto before the chorus that would even impress the likes of Robin Thicke.  The second verse really makes you wanna yell along to the lyrics as if you're marching with Trent and Atticus!  A little after 4 minutes into the song it starts to break down a bit and Trent muses his falsetto in the background of the 80s sounding keyboards a bit before fading out  I can really see this song featured in dance clubs today.  Well I would love to hear it there at least. 10/10<br />6. Disappointed:  The beat really starts out pumping right away in this song.  Trent sings some cryptic vocals to the beat before the chorus angrily kicks in with great industrial fashion.  Really reminds me again of the \\"Downward Spiral\\" a bit.  The setup of the song is similar in structure to \\"Copy of A\\" with a nice background sound in the second verse before exploding to an even more pumping second chorus.  There is a nice breakdown bridge in the song too with some nice groovy instrumentals to end the song.  There is kind of an Egyptian feel to these instrumental parts for me and I love it!  Like Trent was venturing into the Pyramids during this song.  9/10<br />7. Everything:  I don't understand what all the hate was for when this song first came out.  People called it too poppy or whatever.  I will admit at first I didn't really like it at first listen, but not because it sounded poppy, because it didn't live up to previous singles.  But regarding the poppy sound, I seriously don't even think this song sounds poppy.  Just more happy compared to other songs by NIN.  In fact, the chorus is the opposite of poppy.  The song really has grown on me though, but still isn't one of my all time favorites.  I do see this as a good song to work out to though.  8/10<br />8. Satellite:  Another good industrial song to dance to!  Again there is more of the falsetto in the background vocals that goes so well with the feel of the song.  The chorus is sexy in a NIN way and it gets better with repetition.  The song also contains some of the best guitars I've heard from NIN and from rock music in a long time!  Great great great song.  10/10<br />9. Various Methods of Escape: Song starts out a bit quiet before exploding into an amazing rocking chorus.  The guitar in the chorus is excellent!  There is a perfectly beautiful breakdown that is pretty emotional in its sound before exploding back into the rocking guitars.  This would make a great single as well in my opinion!  I would recommend this songs motivational sound to your work out routine soundtrack also!  10/10<br />10. Running: Ironically this song is perfect to listen to while running.  The beat reminds me of an industrial African sound.  The sounds in this song are wild and crazy but the song never turns into noise.  Its all handled with such craft like always by NIN. 8.7/10<br />11. I Would For You: Thesong sounds angry in nature, but it really isn't.  The verses are great.  The chorus is a grower but still awesome.  There is a nice guitar solo before a \\"Closer\\" sounding piano comes in to end the song with!  This song might get better for me with time though!  8.5/10<br />12. In Two:  The beginning of the song will remind many of the great NIN song \\"We're In This Together\\".  Trents verses venture back into the Hiphop sounding style he would use sometimes in \\"Downward Spiral\\" and \\"Prety Hate Machine\\".  The chorus is very electronic before he brings in his falsetto again with some nice industrial guitar to compliment each other.  The song manages to be angry and melodic at once.  There is a breakdown that really sounds just like the breakdown in the song \\"Mr. Self Destruct\\".  Seriously it sounds like a more melodic brother to that song!  The breakdown bridge builds back up with some infectious guitar that sounds like Black Sabbaths \\"War Pigs\\" just a bit!  One of the best songs from NIN hands down. 11/10<br />13. While I'm Still Here: This song will surprise you in your first few listens after the intensity of \\"In Two\\".  This is another build up song.  The difference here is the song just constantly builds up more and more but never really explodes.  That isn't bad though, it's actually really nice.  There is a nice horn section at the end and it really leads into the next track so swiftly.  9/10<br />14.  Black Noise:  The better of the two instrumentals.  I do however think this wouldve been better if they just combined it with the previous track.  They really do sound like one big nice ending to the album.  Still a nice industrial end to a great comeback album that leaves you haunted, but not sad!  9/10<br /><br />Deluxe Edition has some good bonus tracks too.<br /><br />So this album was consistently great.  There was no track I felt like skipping.  It is an epic collection of great NIN comeback songs.  The album is also slightly more uplifting in tone comparedto earlier NIN work, but that doesn't mean it is a happy album.  The album is just not depressing despite the suicidal title.  Many have said this album sounds like a return to the \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Downward Spiral\\" era.  I sort of agree.  I mostly think this is like more of a continuation of \\"Downward Spiral\\" in style than \\"The Fragile\\" was.  I wouldn't have questioned it if this was given the title \\"The Downward Spiral 2\\" or \\"The Upward Spiral\\" honestly.  Though this does sound a lot like the older NIN, it sounds fresh and new at the same time.  This is definitely  better than the previous 3 releases in my opinion.  Best NIN album since \\"With Teeth\\".  This album even has the potential to gain many new NIN fans.  If you're new to the band then I suggest you give this album at least 3 listens before you form a full opinion.  My method when listening to a new album is for me to listen to it 3 times in order.  Then I start to put the album on shuffle and I begin to discover new things in each song!  All in all, I think this is one of the best releases in the rock genre in a long time.  Rock music has been dominated by more of the poppy and indie bands(nothing against them, I like some good indie bands) lately but I think this album would help bring back more of the edgier rock thats been missing in recent years.  Really worth the money.

B00CEK9OTM|4.0|This game uses the tilt function to guide a ball through a maze, past obstacles, into a goal area.  It is a new version of a game even older than I.  On my Kindle Fire, the app functioned flawlessly, the mechanics were seamless, the textures and graphics were vivid and beautiful and the sound was clear.  The only problem was, the game was boring.  It didn't keep my attention, but it scored high in all other fields, so I gave it 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for anyone age 5+ who enjoys simple, but potentially fun games.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A truly deep and meaningful look into teenagers falling in love and battling cancer at the same time. An uplifting story that makes you question if you are really living each day to the fullest.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|One of the best series on TV!! Can't wait for the next season. I have watched this series twice already and will do so again over the winter. :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a really good app. It's a good calculator and it works like most. I use this for school and there's no problem with the app. (other than my not so good battery on my kindle fire but that's not the apps fault) My favorite feature is how it remembers  what problems I've done before it's a great app. This doesn't affect the rating but I'm used to calculators that that solve fraction problems. Still the best calculator app.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|It's a fine movie.  It's very light.  It has some funny and sweet moments.  Not my favorite Cameron Diaz movie though.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Zac Brown is a wonderful performer and highly under rated.  He has a good blend of southern rock and music with a Caribbean beat.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|This movie matches the same level as the Exorcist. Very scary! Hold on to your love one. Heart pounding. Just awesome!
B00E978FGQ|4.0|The movie is pretty fast paced and kept me interested the entire time. I didn't figure out the ending until the ending and that's a good movie.
B008CFN95I|4.0|An easy read with a fun modern twist. A few surprises along the way to make you want to find out the end. Recommended.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Very very good DVD.  Plenty of good songs on this DVD.  I would say this is one of his best.
B0006J28KU|2.0|I really like the line-up of actors.  I had read the reviews of this movie \\"Heat\\" before I bought the dvd.  But...I thought \\"well, I can just mute the explosive noise and pump up the verbal....\\"  That was a miserable failure.  It is hard to poke buttons and keep the action going.  I was really unhappy.  will not be going back to this selection for a re-view.<br /><br />I rarely see a movie in theater because of the shattering sound bombardment and this assault on my ears was just too darn much.  Who ever did the sound on this dvd was just very bad.  I am pretty much disgusted with myself for not believing the reviewers.<br /><br />Thank you for listening to my rant.
B0094K1K8I|5.0|I hope they will make a part 5 but even scarier. Great movie.<br />This movie would be great for Halloween.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Most apps that are free seem like crap but this app (Twitter) is great to me there isn't any bugs or slowness on it....I think ever1 should have this app!!!:):):)
B0037B6QSY|5.0|It is far more 'readable' than what I expected, which was a lot of heavy reading. Yes, the content is deep, but the writing of it is reader friendly, and the concepts included therein, is applicable to all humans.
B0059DQHHI|4.0|never stops with the surprises and plot twists, but is well acted and put together. Too long, but still good if you want a movie like this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game. It was challenging without being frustrating. Would highly recommend it to others. Decent graphics that look good on my kindle.
140006922X|5.0|Who Knows?  Could be!  Definitly a Different perspective.  Could raise an eyebrow or two.  Read it anyway, it's worth it.
0099429985|3.0|This was a super long book (614 pages) which wouldn't have been an issue if the author had stayed on track. As it was this could have been cut by about 200 pages as the heroine's silly (see annoying) inner dialogue prattled on with random off topic issues, spending 8 pages talking about the history off her parents' liquor cabinet and other non-related issues. Some of her inner ramblings were funny but I'll be honest it got to the point where I was skimming just to get on with the actual story (this continued for the entire 600 page read.)<br /><br />I did enjoy the sections where it was written as though the author/heroine is talking directly to the reader. However I still never got a real \\"feel \\" for the heroine. I also had a hard time believing that she was a new mother, her baby is such a non-issue throughout this book, just part of the plot and then she remains in the background as an accessory while Claire goes about her binge drinking and depression at her parents' house. And with that in mind I would have to describe this as bitter chick-lit because while it has its moments of humour it's always with a harsh edge, so that you're not so much laughing as cringing.<br /><br />Claire thought she had the perfect life right up until her husband James announced that he didn't love her anymore and was leaving her for another woman. He might have picked a better day to deliver this earth shattering news than directly after the birth of their first child. Shocked, heartbroken and now packing some serious baby weight, Claire flees London and retreats back to her dysfunctional family in Ireland to regroup. Claire's idea of regrouping is of course to take to bed and only emerge when the baby needs feeding or she runs out of liquor.<br /><br />Eventually she does get out of bed, hitting her father's dusty stationary bike to work off the rage and inadvertently the pounds. Yes her period of mourning has gone from devastation to depression to rage. And then she goes about starting her life again. Along the way one of her sisters drags home Adam, the cute, younger and (obviously unobtainable) man that honestly seems to be flirting with her. Before long Claire has almost forgotten James, well not really but he's no longer her first waking thought and besides Adam has a really nice bum. So then the story gets kinda predictable because of course James comes slinking back. He has some interesting excuses for having his affair but now basically just wants everything to go back to the way it was!<br /><br />Okay I have to talk about James, what an arse. I understand he is meant to the antagonist here but jeez. It's not so much his character I am judging but that of the author deciding our heroine would actually be dumb enough to consider taking him back after the crap he pulled. I mean he hasn't phoned once or even asked after his daughter, in fact doesn't even know her name and to top it all off he blames Claire for the fact that he had an affair. And then Keyes continued to write him in such a way that he actually comes across a bit psycho, with moods changing on a dime (yes she loves to use idioms) and yet our heroine still wants him in her daughter's life. I would be doing everything I could to make sure he never had contact. Anyways.<br /><br />3.5rting her life again.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so fun every one should try it if you like rate five if you don't don't rate at all
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Yes, depressing and exhilarating at the same time.  There were a few moments that his reckless attitude towards life and addictions were awful to watch.  His skill at landing that plane while intoxicated shows how &#34;highly functioning&#34; an alcoholic/addict can be.  We almost all know someone who is a high functioning addict.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I'm only about 30% through, but it's a very interesting read so far. It takes you behind the scenes and reveals jewish history that I've never been exposed to. I'm reading it slow because it's alot to absorb with all the names and cities.
B004V6BQ3O|3.0|The Nikon ME-1 Microphone is good for recording to w/o having the annoying sound of a lens trying to focus. Other than that, the sound is average. If you're looking for a serious video recording device, I'd say to pick up an external recording mic.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|My daughter enjoys coming up with many crazy hair designs that she wants to have.  It keeps her busy during long car rides
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie was so good , the acting was great and the directing outstanding .<br />The characters in this move movie were great ! I would rent it again !
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|Bloomberg does a very nice job of providing up to date financial info in a very convenient app.  I really enjoy the ease of looking at futures and overseas market action to get a feel for what the day will bring.  I wish it was a little simpler to add my own portfolio and have the ability to analyze it in more depth (up to date fundamentals, better technical tools etc.)  Also a daily in depth report on sectors and industries would be asking a lot but it would also be nice.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Awesome movie with great acting and twists and turns  ! I would definitely watch the movie again, the whole family loved it
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I loved these shows when they were on. I have seen when I got the last season that they have a book out for season 9 instead of a show. I will have to read that too!
B006M4F67A|1.0|I downloaded this game to my Kindle Fire HD, but I can not play it. The game constantly freezes after every tile is cleared.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I loved these movies when the came out! I am a fiction junky, LOL. I hope they come out with more sequels
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Jamie Foxx is awesome in this movie!  Warning - it is very graphic violence just as the subject of slavery.  Action packed the whole way through
B004VFN7BE|4.0|I really loved this movie. I love suspenseful thought provoking movies. Cannot believe I have missed this movie before now.
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|BORING!! I like Zombie movies, but this movie could have been done in an hour. The best part of the movie was the end.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|This is a good DVD if you like hard rock music. My son Mikey loves heavy metal music. He has Downs synm. He  loves all music.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|A movie the whole family can enjoy!!  I watched it with my daughter twice! She watched it three times.  Highly Recommended.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|Got this as a gift for my brother-in-law.  He loved it!  I got a great big thanks.  So thanks to you, too, for prompt service.
B00A285OOW|3.0|I have read all of the other books of the Cousin's War series from Gregory but this one left me wondering why the story didn't go farther.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it.  But when I got to the end I was like, &#34;that's it? Seriously?&#34;  I felt like the author could have gone a little further into Elizabeth of York's life after the Perkin Warbeck conflicts.  We know she is the mother King Henry VIII and grandmother to Queen Elizabeth I so why not continue with the story from her perspective?
B000FC13Y0|4.0|This story brought me back to the moments of my younger days when a tale excited your mind and stirred your heart. The moments that your fingers gripped your book so tightly that they turned white in the excitement of the narrative. There was fun and magic in this book.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Older actors that do a good job for mature audiance that has excellent action and adventure for good popcorn viewing
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I've listened to it all the way through one time. I'm looking forward to the next three or four hundred listens just like I have Self Portrait, the original. Fine stuff and love the Bobster!
B000085RPU|1.0|Not sure what region 2 means. No where on the description does it state what this means, but it won't play on my DVD player. Very disappointed by this.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I am sooo excited Season 3 is here. Now i can watch it from Season 1 all the way through until Season 4 starts October 13th. :):):):):)
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|Michael Jackson stands for himself. My Aunt bought me this movie on VHS when I was a kid and I was always talking about how I wanted my son to see it. I was so happy to find it on BluRay. I love it still and now my son does as well.
B0015DWJ8W|2.0|It feels to me that this person wants to be George Sheehan but isn't. The author comes across as elitist and self important.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I am proudly from Atlanta, and recognizing some of the \\"locales\\" where some of the events in \\"Flight\\" take place, bring to mind (and face) the smirking grin I \\"manifest\\" every time I look at \\"Smokey & The Bandit.\\"  I won't review \\"Flight\\" as it seems about 2000 people have beat me to it already; I will, however, say that if Denzel Washington doesn't achieve at least an oscar nomination for his performance here, Hollywood sucks more than 99% of all good Americans already believe.  And THAT said - to see John Goodman (the \\"ex Mr. Roseann\\") playing a dealer - maybe John & Denzel will have to share the oscar.  And being a Stones fan from way back, I dig the way \\"Flight\\" plays \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" before most of Goodman's entrances - infinitely better and much more appropriate and believable than that embarrassing sixties band \\"Steppenwolf,\\" and their three chord wonder, \\"G**da** the pusherman.\\" M Scorcese likes to babble about how much (and to my mind, how poorly) he has used my favorite song-of-all-time, \\"Gimme Shelter\\" - but \\"Flight\\" makes MUCH better use of it in the scene where Goodman takes Washington home after he's released from the hospital.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|I have NO idea why everyone is raving about this book. I am truly surprised that more people are not commenting about the negative vibe the author spews all over the pages. He is so sarcastic and constantly mocks anyone that doesn't believe EXACTLY as he does.<br />I am a very open minded person and allow people to believe in God or Universe or whatever... BUT the author in this book does NOT honor people who might have different beliefs. He literally  makes fun of anyone who believes in God. I stopped reading because of his distasteful and sarcastic writing style. Especially, his \\"myths\\" about God.... my beliefs actually don't align with his views and so I found it pointless to bash and discredit my Divinity even though his myths to me were false. Honestly, I am surprised that Louise L. Hay﻿ and Dr. Wayne W. Dyer﻿ so heavily promote it because frankly, it doesn't match their positive and uplifting writing material.  I was very excited to read the book... but was sorely disappointed.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Bought this for my home computer...just had to have it for my Kindle. That pesky little gopher. Can't put this game down.
B00005JL96|5.0|One of the contemporary Disney films that can still teach a lesson to its viewers. Absolutely a film to recommend.
0345529057|5.0|I thought they were going to be a little bigger hahaha! They are small books, for the price you pay, you cant find a better deal!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|...It is full of plot holes that distract from the story.  For example, you arrive at an alien planet that may be inhabited.  What do you do now?  How about taking the time to study it from orbit?  Map it, listen for radio signals, analyse the atmosphere, and look for artificial structures.  Not this crew - they dive right in and just happen to stumble across the only location on this world that still has traces of the aliens they are looking for.  Really?<br /><br />Still, it has some great visual effects and a few plot twists with a weird, ambiguous, ending.  Not really an &#34;Alien&#34; film but part of that genre.  If you are are building a collection of those films, include this one too.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|We have always considered the weather channel to be very useful in planning our activities for the upcoming week. Having it on my HTC ONE cell phone is very handy.
B000THCFA2|4.0|So original..Love Dilla's music. Donuts is a great platform a musican who is so underated. Listen to this and will change your mind!
B00123IAVA|5.0|This was the album that put &#34;The Purple&#34; on the mape. &#34;Speed King&#34; was the hit, but &#34;Child in time&#34; got the word of mouth.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|A couple of twiists and unexpected turns, and the film was very entertaining.  A good Saturday night popcorn movie with the family.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is very helpful. It is great for school and college and every day uses. I love this dictionary.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 2 year old hacked the password on her Kindle fire and downloaded $100.00 worth of others. I locked her down and changed my password. She loves them though so I kept it for her. Plus it is her Kindle anyway so I'll have her feed the dogs for a few months and make her think she earned them.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Over the pricier one made by the company that made my stroller. It does exactly what I need. It goes on easily and gets out of the way when I need to fold the stroller up. If you don't want the \\"Diono\\" showing, simply turn it around and--poof!--no logo. That also puts the mesh, zippered pocket on the outside, closer to you. I would definitely recommend.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|My 2 year old hacked the password on her Kindle fire and downloaded this along with about $100.00 worth of others. I locked her down and changed my password. She loves them though so I kept it for her. Plus it is her Kindle anyway so I'll have her feed the dogs for a few months and make her think she earned them.
0553103547|5.0|It sure has met my expectations.<br /><br />From begining to end this book have captivated my interest to continue reading the saga.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia has done it again!!! She always manages to make you feel like your living vicariously through the characters!!! Fantastic!
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|This is a really good Cd. It as really good tracks. The only thing that was kind of disappointing was that they left out the bonus tracks which I find kind of cheap. Other then that it was a good buy and a heck of a deal. I would recommend this cd to anyone who appreciates Bring Me the Horizon. Rock on my friends, Rock on.
0425263924|3.0|This could be a REALLY good story if sex wasn't the main component. We have a clear view of what the characters look like and how they feel about each other. I get tired of reading how &#34;she doesn't understand&#34; or &#34;he's angry&#34;. And then to leave the story incomplete....... Get real!!!!!!! It seems to me that the author is just trying to sell more books!!!! If there is another one I won't read it until it's on eBay for a starting bid of .01.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Fun and easy to play cute graphics loads easily but would not connect to face book for free coins but still good
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was fantastic I only wish that Jace wasn't a family member so they could be together. I can't wait to read the next one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have to say again, to wrap your brain around this kind of living is hard to understand, but I am totally hooked on the hunger games trilogy which surprises me!  I have read the other reviews and I understand their disappointments, but that's life some things are unexpected. I was saddened with some of the deaths also. I think for me the unexpected is what kept my carving for more going. I could not stop reading. Sure I probably would have liked a more fairy tale ending,but that's what makes this different and exciting ! I to really liked some of the characters in this book that died and it saddened me like Prim and Finnick(which I had to read twice I just couldn't believe he was gone and really made me sad). The unexpected kept me reading. I really enjoyed these series, to my amazement!! Suzanne Collins has won me as a new reader. I will have no problem read any of her books
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This movie has it all. Enjoyable characters, jokes, nice story line that an adult can appreciate too. If you have kids ages between 5 and 10 this movie is a great entertainment. Additionally, if you wish to have a break from tough guy movies, this is the one.
B000L3CHC0|1.0|It is a very nice watch, but it's a FAKE. Do not buy it, as you will pay a large amount of money for a fake watch.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|I really liked this game until I found out it has a problem. When you play the game on my Kindle Fire at some point if you are down to one bubble and you end up with a chainsaw. The game hangs up and and will not reload the next level.
B008JFUPPI|1.0|About 10 minutes into the movie, I began to realize why this movie had gotten such bad reviews - Ryan Reynolds can't act, and Jeff Bridges was grossly over-doing it with his Brando-esque cotton-in-the-mouth bad imitation of an old fashioned Western sheriff.<br /><br />Reynolds is one of those Hollywood casting puzzles - he's been successful in those light hearted comedies where his main strengths - tall, clean-cut, pleasant looking guy with a nice smile - work well, such as in movies like \\"Just Friends\\", and \\"Waiting\\".<br /><br />How the heck he came to be cast in a series of these super-hero/supernatural roles (\\"Wolverine\\", \\"Green Lantern\\", \\"RIPD\\") is just beyond me - none of them have been anywhere close to being successful.  Kinda like Hayden Christensen's succession of bad movies.<br /><br />For a guy whose acting range never gets beyond smiling and looking serious or slightly worried or sad, it's a major leap of faith to expect him to put any life into a super-hero (or supernatural) role.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges - what to say except that he's been a great actor in other movies but just added to the wreckage of this movie with his awful caricatured performance.  It got to be really annoying just trying to listen to him talk through all that stuff he put into his mouth.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon? - deju vu on his one-note villain performance - he seemed to be just playing a rewind from his villain role in \\"X-men: First Class\\".  I couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />Avoid.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I had to jump on this deal. I mean it was 3 blu-rays for $25. The movies look great and are movies you can watch over and over.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book synthesized everything I have come to know in my heart of hearts that is true.  But it did so in a way that I could begin to act in concert with my knowledge.  The book seemed to &#34;pop&#34; into my life at exactly the right moment for me.  I hope the same will be true for you.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|This is what I call talent. Ariana's songs are appropriate for all audiences. Her voice is so beautiful! Ariana's songs have a meaning, they aren't trashy. Her music sounds like 90's music, I can literally listen to her album all day. Love this album!! You won't regret buying this album! Make more albums soon Ariana, I would buy all of them :D
B00948EPOQ|5.0|This film is a gem.  If you love Paris, this film captures the magic of the city.  The story is very cleaver!!  Love, love, love this film.  I'm leaving for Paris tomorrow and I wanted to watch a film that would get me excited for the trip.  This was the movie!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed the author's notes telling about writing it and who influenced him.<br />Also, my Dad loved science fiction and he would have liked this.<br />It as a good mix of action, quick thinking and the psychological problems that occur in the future.<br />I have recommended this book to those I know who would like an action/adventure with a twist.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I knew little or nothing about the time in which Jesus of Nazareth lived beyond the gospel passages the nuns let us read. Aslan provides a generally well-documented, non-judgmental picture of that important century while leaving it to the reader to judge the divinity of the primary character
B006LSZECO|2.0|My book club picked this book and during our discussion, we all agreed we did not like the principal characters.  The story started out good, but went downhill from there.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|SOA is a wonderful show. It manages to illustrate almost all aspects of life (children, marriage, abortion, making a living, interpersonal relationships, loyalty, etc) through the prism of a motorcycle club (consisting of criminals and thugs). Well done!
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|I wish they would update this game to allow you to play with your friends.  It's great if you just want to waste time, but not as much fun as other games.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|didnt see the first one but this one is good enough to make me want to see the first one with sylvester stalone
0553381407|5.0|I read this book after my spouse told me that I had a problem and I needed help.  Instead of investing money in a therapist, I read through and did the exercises in this book and I have successfully managed my problem with my parents.  My parents were not as bad as what this book made them out to be, but the techniques work just the same.<br /><br />I was engaged and about to get married when everything went into a downward spiral thanks to my folks.  After reading this book and coming to terms with my situation, I was able to save my marriage and manage my parents.  I recommend this book to anyone that has a spouse that doesn't like to spend time with your family.  'Toxic' is a harsh word, but once you get past the word you can start to repair your life.
1250029465|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I read it in one afternoon, and couldn't wait to start the sequel, &#34;The World According to Bob.&#34;  Wonderful, heartwarming study of people and their animals.  And thankfully, not a tear-jerker!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great adaptation of the Frank Miller Dark Knight Graphic Novel. Very Dark apocalyptic future in this reality with some interesting twists. A must see for every Batman fanatic.
1444777556|5.0|I recommend this for those who love animals and the connections we have with our animals.  Heart-warming and a quick, easy read.
B009WUBERW|4.0|If you like action and allot of kissling then this is the movie for you. All o fthe &#34;old school&#34; bad asses are all in rare form.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't remember how I came across this wonderful book, but when I saw that you can get five books for about six dollars for the Kindle edition all in one, I was interested. Just reading the sample I was sold. The book is well written, and contains on of the most captivating plots I've experienced in ages. I've also just started reading the prequel series: Shift.
B000000H40|5.0|Obituary was the first Death Metal Band I ever got into this was the first Album I ever heard by them I have since gotten into bands like Cannibal Corpse,Suffocation,Morbid Angel,Deicide,Napalm Death.Carcass and more recently Aborted,Nile,Mortician,Dying Fetus,Misery Index,Cephalic Carnage  and The Faceless among other but this the CD that started me on Death Metal so check it out you'll be glad you did
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I must amend my previous review.  I did get my farm back without having to contact anyone, it just reappeared.  We still don't seem to have all the features the new version has but it's slowly coming along.  Really enjoy this game and have spent nothing!
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This thing works so well. It doesn't even run the battery down, like I thought it would. I bought to use while I ride my motorcycle.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game, be careful you can play for hours and not even know it. It's perfect for long flights. It's also easy to play
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|iT'S A GREAT STORY, AND IT BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES OF OUR TRIP TO POLAND. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS VIDEO TO EVERYONE
193700788X|2.0|You would think being the last of the Sookie Stackhouse series this would have been one hell of a book,  but it wasn't.  It just flat out sucked. I'm sorry to see the series end in such a manor, as a reader you knew Sookie would get off , the story line was jumbled and the plot just fell flat.  What a sad way to end a great series.<br />J. Morehart
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I only read the three top reviews and saw some craziness about this being a ripoff of angry birds (or some such nonsense). This is obviously a Stupid Zombies ripoff,  not an angry birds ripoff. Still, it's AWESOME! A ton of fun, great storyline. I think it's a blast.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Graphics aren't great but its a fun game.  Its very hard to put down but the first levels are easy.  I'm sure it gets harder at some point.
B005UT29Z0|4.0|Very interesting movie for anyone who has worked in a big company with many layers of management between you and the top. The minions in this movie mix with the big guys in a frank and disturbing manner.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|As I have stated before, each soundtrack is excellent, it would be great if they were in order of the scenes in the movies, but I know which scene goes with which track. Guess you could call me a fan.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's a super cute app and I thoroughly enjoy playing all the time.<br /><br />the more animals you get the slower it goes though.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Short and sweet. Get It, Love It, All Ages can find new bands, or others that have been around a few years, to start listening to on a regular basis. I will be buying other CD's based on what I have heard
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the bomb man its so much fun its a good game for when you get bored cause its exciting and you can play with friends and play together
B0012QCZ54|5.0|This movie definitely Steps it up from the first. To me the first was a foundation, a little slow yet important. The final dance off is absolutely incredible. And while I am not a rap or hip hop person normally, I enjoyed the music
B00CBKLO52|1.0|First time I downloaded it, it worked fine, I got rid of it, but decided to get it again. When I downloaded it, it would not open at all. Any suggestions?
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Music is superb. Love every track on it. It has definitely opened me to more than my &#34;old fashioned rock 'n roll&#34; and country tunes.
B008VO3PA4|3.0|The first 1/4 of the book is mostly funny, then it's downhill from there. If I had to do it again, I would pass on buying this book.
B003JSU2NU|5.0|I'm (older) and I loved every track. All Twilight Fans will enjoy this soundtrack. The fun is placing the track to the scene in the movie, I've been rabid enough to watch the movies several times over and can place each one. ENJOY
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Love this show! I have only gotten partway through season 3 but when I am finished, I'll be loaning this to my ex, who is a geek and an amalgam of all four of the guys on this show.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|Takes you personally into a tragedy and allows it to be seen from the point of view of the mother - what did she do wrong? What could she have done better?<br />Fascinating.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Worked great on a 10 hrour cross-county with a passenger doing the uploading -- first time users.  Wonder how much Verizon wil be billing me for busting my 4 Gig/month data limit?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was so happy to find this season online at such an affordable price! It was not available in many other places, and I had an easy time viewing the shows.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Well written by another introvert. When growing up didn't know the word for it, but knew my personal/social inclinations were somewhat different. Slowly came to realize that the word &#34;introvert&#34; belonged to me, and began trying to know the meaning that concept had for my own experience. This writer shares her own experience with discovering what being an introvert was for her. This is a well documented book with numerous examples of others in the discovery process. Very much recommend this book for both introverts/extraverts and those that might feel themselves somewhat in between.
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|I did not enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would.  If you compare to others in the genre (&#34;Untouchables&#34;) it pales by comparison.  Given the star power of the cast, I was very surprised it was so boring.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|In a time of teaching compassion and showing our children how we need to truly be together, Wonder is a perfect book for families and teacher&#34;s &#34;read-a-louds&#34;! Written from several perspectives, this book lets you into the &#34;feeling&#34; and actions for those around a wonderful boy, born with facial challenges. If your school or family is working on &#34;filling up each other's buckets&#34; this is the book to use. You will be pulled in instantly and quickly moved as each person shares their hearts deepest fears and wonderings.
6303182577|5.0|The incredible music, the unbridled passion of the performers, the riveting back story and the undeniable historical significance of Woodstock combine to make this the best music performance video of all time.  The editing, directed by Thelma Schoonmaker, Martin Scorsese and Michael Wadleigh, is unmatched for its pacing and imagery, thanks in part due to the effective use of multiple-image and split screen techniques that are now legendary.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|Bought because we had the first two CDs and I was going to the BTR concert with my daughter, and thought we could listen to it to get familiar with the songs.  This CD is really good, and the band members are very talented.  I won't hesitate to buy any of their future CDs.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I download and try a lot of game apps and most don't last a day.  This one has made my regular rotation.  Easy to play but challenging, addicting, great for a quick fix!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun and easy to play great game<br />I enjoy it takes only a couple sec to play a level great quick and easy game play upgrades m a me a huge difference
B007PS0DTI|4.0|This is not a super smart movie, but the script is not &#34;lazy&#34; like with other action movies. It looks great and it is action packed. I am biased though; I really liked the whole series.
0345803485|1.0|I was pretty intrigued to get this book, mainly due to the hype and because I wanted a fun, light read. What I got was not at all what I was expecting. If you've been looking for the long-lost part V to the Twlight series, you can stop your search! I'm surprised this book is marketed towards adults. It's a teenage fantasy novel with some BDSM thrown in as a shock factor. The story is unbelievable. A 21 year old American college girl that speaks like a 35 year old British woman and a 27 yr. old billionaire that's a cross between Mr. Darcy and Edward Cullen. Most of the dialogue between the two consists of Ana blushing, looking down at her hands, tripping over herself (literally) and having orgasms at the mere sight of him. Can we say, annoying?<br />Like many reviewers have already mentioned, the story is incredibly repetitive, the story line incredulous to believe and the characters are weak. The book really could have been cut down from its 514 pages to probably 250 with plenty of room to spare if Ana didn't spend so much time talking to her \\"inner goddess\\" or looking down at her hands.<br /><br />Skip it! Unless of course, you take it for what it is - a mediocre quick read with a hint of romance and a measure of BDSM.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I found Chromecast easy to install and it is convenient to use from a Windows laptop or from an iOS or Android device. Streaming Netflix from an iPad and controlling it worked well. Streaming HBOgo from a Chrome browser window was a major disappointment. It was extremely choppy. I do not believe I had anything intense running on my network, though we do have many connected devices. Based on comments below, I suspect the problem is the Core 2 Duo laptop I am using. Perhaps I will get more value from the ChromeCast once I upgrade (I'm waiting on a good Haswell Win 8 convertable tablet).<br /><br />The reality is that I can use my PS3 for watching Netflix (and Amazon instant video), but I hoped I would get value from the Chromecast by mirroring Chrome on a laptop. Based on the performance I experienced, it looks like I will just have to wait for more services to be supported.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I bought this as a gift for for a 43 yr old fan of the series - my son who lives in another state, so I can't personally vouch for the gruesome factor of this special edition package, but my son said that it looks \\"awesome.\\" Since it was a gift, his opinion is the only one that matters.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It was a good action movie with a good plot with an interesting view of the future. It was interesting from beginning to end.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|LOVE this CD. Blake Shelton delivers again. The opening &#34;Boys Round Here&#34; sets the tone and he just rocks out from there. Get it. That's all: Just get it.
B00A27X972|5.0|A very different slant on we humans...in a very different slant of a story.  I enjoyed the author leading me down an unknown path to eventually let me discover where I was going.
B0061JPYX2|2.0|This was released after Amy Winehouse died, and I purchased it because Loved (with a capital L) &#34;Back to Black&#34;. But &#34;Hidden Treasures&#34; was a disappointment to me. There are several covers on it, and they are not great---the vocals actually sound a little distorted/muddy to me. There are rumors that the last song on the CD was recorded while Amy was high on heroin. It sounds like this might be true when you listen to the song. Sad. I was hoping for more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|loved the storyline kept wanting to continue reading to find out what was going to happen next, I read the whole book in two days.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|This CD just grows on you.  The selections are great even if you don't read the books.  But if you have read the books, putting a little soundtrack to them is all the better!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful and interesting study of human relationships, fun reading.  I highly recommend it to you.  One, two, three, four, five.
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|I have always adored this movie! And I wanted to share it w/ my 2 year old son, that is just barely able to sit and watch a whole movie! He asked for Nemo all weekend!
B00DC3DGSK|4.0|Great version of evil twin on the 2nd CD, with Joe Perry & Steven Tyler one of the best !!!!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Easy to read<br />Fresh novel you can read each book in no more than 4 days.<br />Always keep you interested on what's going to happen next
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great for the basic calculator needs. easy to type and big on the kindle screen. make it scientific would be an improvement!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game has fast action and quick stages. Very enjoying!<br />The controls are a little tough, but usable.<br />My kids enjoy playing, has levels like angry birds.
B0063GORYU|4.0|like the game, stimulating and easy to hold my concentration, just learning the game and working through the moves required to win!!!
B003L20ICE|4.0|But not for family viewing, I thought it was a good story, my wife hated it for the graphic sexual content, now I do not pick the movies anymore. Very quick delivery.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Interesting and different from the Netflix series-- I liked that I was still learning new things despite having watched the entire series.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a great memoir, likes to laugh and also has an interest in our judicial system.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|This was one of those shows that was suspenseful but it was the mystery of it all that made it all the better to watch.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love playing this game!! It is very fun. It has its own twists and effects on top of the ordinary uno game we all know and love. Definitely worth your while!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the weather channel app it is the best app to see what i will wear the next day. I don't watch the news so this app helps.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love puzzle games and &quot;finding the missing items&quot; games. This mixes both. I just started playing and so far so good!
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|Highly entertaining little game. Creative concept and great execution. Definitely worth a buck or two but it's a no brainer as the FAOTD!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|There is nothing outstanding nor revealing.  So what..you did a crime and you paid the price.  Everyone knows that life in a prison is awful. That is why most people walk the straight and narrow.  OK, so it is unsual that a white upperclass woman will ever go to prison.  So maybe, this illustrates a bit of &#34;justice&#34;.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the thinking process of this game.Look forward to some new rooms with a few more extra rooms attached
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This is great character development.  Interesting and easy to read.  However, just the same old story of oppression and abuse of the innocent.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|had seen this many times but I still love it! Bought it for ym sister and I to watch.  Sandra = awesome, as always!
B002GLSX8C|5.0|This is the defining era for Led Zeppelin and this film embodies the spirit and attitude of the band and the concert...with a little extra thrown in for good measure and entertainment.  Awesome.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|and i was laughing my butt off!  My husband and i loved it! Paul Rudd is hilarious in this film!
B001EC3JME|4.0|I like this because it does what it is designed and sold for, and does it pretty doggone well. I am a pro stagehand and use my flashlight a LOT for work. The brand of light I use, you buy the light, then buy the holster. The recommended holster,  which, in  buying two lights and two holsters, the holsters  haven't worked out for me. I saw one of these on a buddy's belt. I had to have it, and I'm glad I bought it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|THIS IS AN EXTREMELY WELL WRITTEN BY A WOMEN THAT WORKS WELL AND ENJOYS HER WORK!  SHE IS MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT THAN WOMEN TWICE HER AGE BUT CERTAINLY NOT 'FULL OF HERSELF' AND SPEAKS TRUTHFULLY.  I COULD EASILY READ HOWEVER MANY BOOKS SHE WRITES IN THE FUTURE.
B004CMBZJC|4.0|While providing an intersting travel through the time-locked Cardiff of the Doctor Who universe, the sets were distractingly poorly made and the acting was occasionally over the top. Otherwise a very well written and executed series
B0027MJU00|3.0|Interesting book.  I liked the style - good story telling and interesting with the flashes back and forth between modern and past.  I did enjoy the book - but still - just OK for me (wish I could put 3.5 stars)
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I use him to entertain kids of all ages -- including myself.  I love to sing or when the dogs bark he hears everything!!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great, great book.  Enjoyed it immensely.  Most of my fantasy reading of the last few years has been George RR Martin and Jordan - and to read this book and experience it moving at a very quick pace was great.  Just loved it - very sad that the next in the series won't be out until next year - but still loved the book!
B00A0MJA1I|1.0|i was shocked when i opened the bluray disk the condtion is very bad<br />i have two bluray players the main one took ages to load and in the end it didnt<br />the 2nd one played the disk after long time
B004QX07G4|5.0|My husband thought my loud outbursts of laughing were funny . I didnt care I kept laughing, he needs sleep
B00ECUARO8|4.0|matthew brings his dark and dangerous side, right when you think you know where the movie stands you get thrown for a dramatic loop.
B00BI5IXL4|3.0|Please take my review with a grain of salt.  I don't understand the appeal of musicals either on stage or on screen.<br /><br />A musical is exactly that- a story that is based entirely around singing and dancing.  The problem usually is that the music is overbearingly pretentious and cringeworthy (but to be fair, not always terrible) and that's what makes Les Miserables a chore to sit through.  It's not bad in the beginning, but about halfway through the music losses its sense of melody and joy and instead feels like a bunch of people showing off by hitting all the high notes for an extended period of time.  It gets on my nerves.  Not a preference of mine.<br /><br />Another problem is that, with Les Miserables in particular, the melodies are really derivative of other sources.  Many of these songs remind me of the rock operas that bands such as Jethro Tull, Queen and the Who had done.  Yes I realize rock and music theater are two separate beasts, but it doesn't change the fact that the vocal melodies themselves are similar.  One melody that Russell Crowe sings near the beginning even sounds exactly like the Bee Gee's \\"Words\\".<br /><br />Another problem is that spending a considerable amount of time hitting nothing but high notes makes it near impossible to make out the actual words being sung and as you know, in order to follow a story you need to hear and understand the words.  But... in this case, you can't.  It's not just because of the constant use of high notes either- sometimes the melodies are sung too darn fast, or there's too many people singing at the same time.  Plus there's a strange accent to most of these songs.  Sounds like a fake attempt to sound British.  It's weird.  Either way 60% of the words are hard to understand.  Perhaps grabbing a lyrics sheet would make it easier to follow along.<br /><br />I find it sometimes annoying that *every* *single* *line* has to be sung.  Sometimes I think given the lackluster vocal melodies on a few occasions, that it would have been better to speak instead of sing those lines.  These lackluster parts are obviously included as a way to build into the next segment and theme, but still.  It feels awkward more often than not.<br /><br />For those of you that think this movie version is too violent or inappropriate.  Well, compared to most things on TV these days, not really.  Les Miserables is mild in comparison.  I imagine a general feeling when it comes to musicals is an expectation of good-hearted acting and singing, and that's the main reason people are making a big deal about the few sexual related segments.<br /><br />Les Miserables is still decent.  That's why it gets a 3-star rating.  Other than the above problems, it's adequate enough for musical lovers to feel satisfied with it.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|a must have, some hits are a blend of comtemporary and 20's, i believe this one going to be a classic, def hgwy music, but i have a problem downloading it on a ipod,
0545128285|5.0|Very cute stories, this edition is translated by Hermione and had notes by Albus Dumbledore. It makes it a cute read for Muggles.
B005OYKI1I|4.0|you think it would be good and it was, both contributing talent and tetestorone with alot of action, worth watching
B004UFEJXK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and we bought a copy for our nephew. He loved it as well!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Pros:<br />- Amazing mouse with excellent build quality<br />- Not too large, fits perfectly in most hands<br />- Logo LED can change colors<br />- 8000dpi at that price is amazing<br />- Buttons very comfortable and don't get in the way<br />- It's wired, no battery needed<br />- Weights allow you to add a little more weight to the mouse, I added all of them.<br />- Pads are smooth, don't look like they'll wear any time soon<br />- Super good price<br />- Software is decent, about the same as Razer Synapse but without the macro settings. Macro is OTF recording<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Scroll wheel and dpi indicator can't change colors<br />- That's it<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />Great mouse, great price, would buy over a Razer mouse any day since it's about the same at much cheaper. Super comfortable, and the dpi switching comes in handy for people that multitask complex tasks that require different precision like me. Overall, extremely satisfied, my only complaint is the scroll wheel light's color can't be changed, but that's fine when I'm using it.
0307887960|4.0|It is not only a diet book but I appreciate the backing with the science and explaining the how and why you body reacts.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Here is not only fun and urgent action is not a bad idea of the Beauty and accessories for the test back in time rush to be the vampire weekend and women who were in a bad idea to have to buy dogs and
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There is still the sense that no one is entirely safe, even as the stakes and the writing continue to improve as the show proceeds.  Performances by the actors are top notch, with a particular nod to Andrew Lincoln and the young man playing his Son.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's a must read can't wait for the movie to come out you must read the trilogy it's way better than twilight!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing, beautiful, musical writing. Green thoroughly captures the awful depths of cancer but writes in a way that makes the illness relatable to myriad other challenges. One of the best books I have ever had the pleasure to read.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is fun  and addictive but there need to be other means for collecting more resources necessary for advancing in the game.
B009AZZEU2|3.0|I should start by stating that I do LOVE Soundgarden – all Soundgarden: from Screaming Life all the way to Down on the Upside.  Obviously nothing will ever touch SUPERUNKNOWN, but King Animal sounds like what I would have expected as the follow up to Down on the Upside, except of course that it was released a decade and a half later. Some songs return to the bands roots (or at least in the neighborhood) and some are more similar to their later efforts. One song I can’t stand, but the rest range from good to great.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the best thing I can say about King Animal is that it truly sounds like Soundgarden and not some washed up lite version put together for yet another reunion tour. I like this album and I like it for the music it contains, not just because I’m starved for anything these four put together.<br /><br />My only complaints would be that I was really hoping for at least one more contribution from Matt and there are a couple of songs that sound a bit too much like Chris solo efforts (the later stuff, which was a little on the whiny side IMHO).<br /><br />3 stars because one does have to consider their entire body of work as the basis for comparison, but average Soundgarden is still better than most other bands on their best day.
B001EC2J20|4.0|It was long movie. But I like how Neo has to figure out what he thunks he does not under stand
B0067Q42BY|1.0|This was already a free app of the day...it's already in my Amazon Cloud. I uninstalled the app because of the ads. Too....many....ads<br /><br />It's a shame about the ads because it is a good game. Remove the advertising and I'll change my rating.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Been a fan of magic for a long time and love this app....recommend it to everyone who plays magic ....even for beginners...I feel they would have enjoyment of this game and app
B003W77TPC|3.0|I bought it for a friend, he likes it more than I do. It is strong jazz and Erroll Garner's personal story is interesting.
0571202284|5.0|Its the best guide to start with if you are thinking in learning and getting into animation and should be a must have for those already in the field
B009MF56GC|4.0|Glad to see Arnold had a bigger role this time.  I would have gave it 5 stars but there was a few slow moments in the movie but overall one of the best action movies of 2012.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|I enjoy classical music and these two are wonderful to listen to. Each has their own beautiful voice but together they are awesome. Jonathan could be the next Pavarotti, he is that good.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I hated the series to end but it ended on such a good note.  I love all of Christopher Nolan's films.  He such a talented writer and director!
B00746O3X8|3.0|I bought this product, but only tried it out a couple of times before I realized that the humble camera strap works just as well or better.<br /><br />When the strap is worn around the neck, the camera obviously can bounce around too much in certain situations (for instance, while hiking on rugged trails).  This product is meant to fix this problem by holding the camera attached to the chest.  However, the same effect can also be achieved by inserting one arm inside the camera strap loop while the strap is around the neck, and pushing the strap around the shoulder using the upper arm.  The shortened loop now holds the camera sufficiently tightly against the body.  This works well also when wearing a backpack.  Both doing and undoing this operation is fast enough, and avoiding one additiona piece of gear is very nice.<br /><br />What I described works with one camera.  The Opteka harness may be a better solution for multiple cameras: I don't know.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|Glad to have all these film in HD finally!  Well worth tossing out my DVD copies.  Enjoyed all these movies!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Weather Channel app has some nice graphics and a map feature.  However, it does not display the humidity, which is very important. WeatherBug app gives the same instant info and it includes humidity.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This Bond film had a unique distinction to it.  It was gritty and felt like I was somewhat in one of Nolan's movies.  The director did a job with this movie.  I enjoyed it a lot.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I am not a huge fan of the Bates Prison story line, but an overall great season, to be sure.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This series is very intriguing I could not stop watching it.  It is one of the best series I have seen.
B00AEBB8H4|5.0|Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, Alfred Hitchcock and the Riviera.  It is beautiful, interesting and very enjoyable.  If you don't know who these people are, you need to find out.
B00821OX98|2.0|not my kind of show.rather watch the dome ,csi,or criminal minds they r more my type of entertainment.everyone in my home watches the dome.
1118156315|5.0|I have read a previous book &#34;business model generator&#34; and from a first glitch it is almost the same, however, the CANVAS technique in this book is used for a personal development model rather than for a business model. I must say that it is a pleasure to read this book cause of a grate visualization and cases used in it. In my opinion it is by far the most successful edition of books for personal and organizational (business) innovation implementation!
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|We love anything with Simon Pegg in it.  Odd British humor, wild, sweet, funny...this was a treat and we laugh every time we see it again.
0375413405|5.0|Great book to lean about French cooking! I can't put it down.  Buy it now and enjoy.  You will not be sorry.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book is very interesting, very well written, and not so technical that the reader can't understand it.  It was done with humanity for the family, and the medical information was fascinating.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|This is one on those games that once you start playing...you can't stop.  Absolutely love it.  Plenty of levels to keep you busy.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|As a former HS teacher,  I recommend this novel for its authentic voice of a teen faced with  a \\"not if but when\\" health prognosis.  Readers will finish the book with a rich understanding of the complex emotions adolescents experience living with serious illness.  Yet the book is also a delightful read because of these teens sardonic \\"take\\" on their lives.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Amazon is a company that still remembers what customer service is and also that the customer is always right.  I've done plenty of business with Amazon and it's always a positive experience. A few times I've run into a glitch and contacted customer service...they've fixed the problem and even gave me something extra for my time and trouble.  They are an A1 company.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I like flight scene, great movie, good price for 3 combo, I have Blue-ray living room, DVD for laptop, UltraViolet for trip.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It was a little confusing moving forward or backward in time.  It was exciting and kept me guessing right to the very end.  I love books with a happy ending!
B00004SAAY|5.0|Great sound best record, some is not originally digital record though, all great sound, I like this collection. Best gift item for classic listeners.
B008L5G4I8|2.0|The introduction was misleading.  The book was much to promiscuous for my taste.  It was not believable or in good taste!
1452000247|4.0|This was an interesting tale full of weird ideas about dreams and magical realms.  It starts off with Peter turning 10 and getting a special present from the lady down the road.  Once he travels in a magic-like clock he discovers a different world and sets off on an adventure.  The ending most certainly left me slightly creeped out and it appears this is going to possibly be a series.  The poems at the end are very interesting.<br /><br />Not quite fantasy, not quite fairy tale, not quiet epic quest...but definitely worth a read.  :)<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book for an honest review.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It just took me a couple of minutes to install and get my Chromecast setup. For $35.00 you can't go wrong if you are a Netflix subscriber and want to watch YouTube on a big screen, the interface through my iPad is amazingly fast and so good I am going a buy another for my living room even though I have a smart tv and a blu-ray that provide those features. I am looking forward to what added applications that will come available in the future.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Funny & heart touching . I never liked Steve Carell more ! And the minions are adorable! I think I'm having my second childhood , lol.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was one of the best books ever. Thoughtful, poignant , romantic, but not sappy. It's as good as everyone says!
B0093X805W|5.0|This was one of the first long chapter books my 6 year old son and I read together.  It was a great read and my son was excited to see what happened next to each child in the story.  I was amazed by the questions he asked about the story that never occurred to me.  Overall it was fun seeing an old favorite through his eyes.
0439023521|5.0|THIS IS A VERY CLEVER BOOK. HAVE ALSO READ #2 AND #3.<br />WOULD RECOMMEND.<br />CAN'T WAIT FOR NUMBER 4 TO ARRIVE.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Excellent read, as always. Couldn't put the book down, like all Jeffrey Archer books. I cannot get enough of them.
B001U1V3RW|3.0|Great handling but if you know anything about card magic after a while the black borders can start to fray making it very difficult to hide a double lift without some serious manipulation of the cards.  The black is good for IT tricks though.
B003DWC6IQ|5.0|Excellent read, as always. Couldn't put the book down, like all Jeffrey Archer books. I cannot get enough of them.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|The shipping was prompt and the movie arrived in perfect condition.  It was a gift to my daughter for her birthday and she loved all the action!
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Excellent read, as always. Couldn't put the book down, like all Jeffrey Archer books. I cannot get enough of them.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|We have let my daughter watch this movie on television before and she loved it. We bought it on amazon for cheaper than we could find at both walmart and target. very happy with our purchase.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|I've had this album on repeat all morning...it's so perfect. Amazing lyrically and musically.<br /><br />Dan's voice is chilling. I've never heard anything quite like it and I could listen to it all day. Do yourself a favor and buy this album.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I love Hollywood's way of taking an already great movie and making it better by throwing in a little romance....McConnaghey and Foster have great on-screen chemistry, and you get a little glimpse of the talent each possesses that emerges in later movies.  Another of my most fave movies.. A must see!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|An excellent opportunity to sharpen your memory.  Also great  for better hand to eye contact coordination.  Great for just passing time.  It is a good tool for with working with a young child to teach touch screen protocol and also patience and concentration.  Also just plain fun.  Your're never to old or to young  to enjoy games and learn at the same time.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|This is my first time reviewing poetry and I enjoyed it. This author definitely has a way with his words. This was written in such a tasteful manner and I still got the message from it. I rate this book 4*<br /><br />(Copy provided by author)
B0007LXPBI|5.0|my kids love this movie. every time they watch it I have a great time watching them laugh. its the best when you can have a great time during family time.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I chose 5 stars because it was adventurous and scary and I would tell my mom and friends to read this book
B00000IMTE|4.0|A great album, but a flawed remaster. There is a dropout during \\"Temple of the King\\" in the section \\"Far from the circle, at the edge of the world, Hes *DROPOUT HERE* hoping, wondering\\". This dropout does not exist in the original version of the CD, making this remaster unfortunately not worth replacing your original copy with (unless you want two copies, since the other songs are fine).<br /><br />I got this remaster soon after it came out to my memory, if by any chance this dropout has been fixed in the mean time, someone please comment and let me know.<br /><br />(Just checked my disc again, the dropout occurs at 3:27 in the track, and isn't as obvious as I remember it... the first time I listened to it and repeatedly after that, it hit me straight between the eyes, now I had to listen carefully to find it... depends on how picky you are I guess. I did some additional research and I can also hear the dropout at the same point on the Japanese SHM-CD UICY-93618 remaster CD version. Can't hear it on my original Polydor CD though... don't know if it is there and the remastering just made it more obvious, but it is worth pointing out and others on the internet have mentioned it too.)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|For the most part, this book was an excellent read, with well-developed characters. However, it really dragged through the middle one-third, and I was quite bored (high school plays, chaperoning dances, and other events that I just couldn't bring myself to care about), but I pushed through it.  The story had a satisfying end, but after such a long slog in the middle accounting hum-drum activities, the major event in the plot, and its repercussions, occurred very suddenly, which threw off the overall pacing of the story. The storyline in Derry was excellent, but overshadowed the rest of the book.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|The sets are excellent. You are there! The acting is very good but if I had to ding it for something it would be there is almost no comic relief. Very serious.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This is a must read for a thinking person.  A fascinating biography of one of the most influential humans, ever.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I don't love In This Moment's other albums, but I sure love Blood.<br /><br />Their other recordings are OK, but there's something about Blood that I really enjoy.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't get enough of this program.  Only wish there were more episodes in a season.  Fantastic program - wonderfully written!  I'm looking forward to Season 3.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|It was a really good book, I read it in 3 days, I just couldn't put it down! I wish It was a little longer though. other than that it was great!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|If you're into music, and particularly music history, you can't go wrong with this documentary. Informative, interesting, fun. Some huge players are included (Dave Grohl, Neil Young, Paul McCartney, etc). A fascinating look at the life of a music studio through the industry's changes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show! Seasons 1 and 2 were awesome! Season 3 is just as good if not better! Highly recommend!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love the app, it has great graphics and it stays updated as well. The alarm  feature is pretty awesome too!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have Kindle for my HP 10&#34; touchpad.  I have enjoyed it!  However, i am enjoying reading with Kindle for androids even better!  My android is a seven inch tablet.  It is like reading a paperback book.  I enjoy the fact that I know were I am, with respect to page #, in reading the book and the estmated time to the next chapter.  I like how fast the pages turn.
B002OTO38K|5.0|Whether your a moralist who believes all trans-people should burn in hell, or a easy going individual who accepts people for who they are... This is a good movie.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|It gives you the energy and some good advice on how to get the courage and some tools that can help you to be free of employment
B00DU77QP2|5.0|I bought this book on recommendation from a friend. My interest lies in psychological thrillers and humour, I wouldn't usually consider fantasy books however Cassandra Clare has converted me with this series. I bought each book straight away after finishing the other and had the 5 of them read in a week, the series is a great read! I've now started reading her other series infernal devices, I hope its as good! :D
B00BTHWFEC|5.0|I was smart to wait until I got the vinyl version of this to listen to it for the first time. The cd version is great too. This album absolutely kills. This is a double album, and when I got it I could see why: There are only a few songs on some of these two records,as they wisely did not cut these songs short, in order to make them fit onto one LP. They kept the length of these songs as long as they felt inspired to play them. Ozzy's vocals are great. And he is one of the few rock vocalists who stills sounds like he always did, if not better. The lyrics are dark and are in keeping with Black Sabbath's original sound. Tony's guitar playing seems to have evolved too as one might expect. This album is one that I will cherish forever as it is the first LP of new material from any band that I have bought in some years. I strongly urge any Sabbath fan to check out this new album. And if you have never bought a Sabbath record or cd this one is great to start with. Here is what I did: I didn't pop this record onto the turntable the minute I opened it. I waited until it was dark outside and the I lit 50 (yea that's right 50) tea candles and put them all over the house and turned out the lights and cranked it up. I made myself a little private listening party, and it was awesome! This record comes on 180 gram vinyl and when I opened it I was struck by how heavy it is. I actually bought the cd first but I didn't listen to it until I heard the vinyl version first! The cd and record both come with bonus tracks which are great. Whether you buy this on cd or vinyl....do yourself a favor and get it. You will not be disappointed!!! Don't forget the candles! Rock on my friends.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|I would highly recommend this series! Cassandra Clare is brilliant at writing fantasy stories and I am now reading another of her series in the hope its as good as this was!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Wow - I cannot put this book down. Martin's writing is fabulous and I look forward to getting through the series.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|I loved this fantasy series, I would recommend it to anyone and everyone! I hope the movies do this series justice!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't like this game I love,but I wish there was dinosaur and spongebob eggs like some other minecrafts like in China
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book hit the nail on the head! I've believed in the Law of Attraction for quite some time, but there has always been some sniggling doubt in the back corner of my brain.  I based my purchase on the fact that there were 400+ positive Amazon reviews of this book, and it paid off again. I just completed the first of the nine experiments, and it worked exactly as they said it would.  I can't wait to do the rest.  It's written in a very conversational way that makes you feel that the author is a real person speaking directly to you.  Love It!
0618918248|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys or at least does not fear using his reason to understand his existence.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This is a British family saga that starts out happily as a young girl of poor social stature takes the lowest staff position in the house of a wealthy family. She progresses to the position of 'lady's maid' to the eldest daughter. She is privy to the underlying secrets of the children of the family, which puts her in an uncomfortable place. It is a story of the changes in society as time passes that bring about complications in the lives of the family members. It is a story of intrigue and suspense and surprise.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. It was sad but good. It made me remember that life is precious cherish every minute of it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I was sooo looking for another series to read to keep me reading for a long period of time. I started reading this book, never having read a fantasy novel before, and at first I thought BORING!!! After I got past the first few chapters I couldn't set it down. I love the way the book is written from each persons perspective and there is so much going on at all times that there is rarely a dull moment. Very emotional, funny at time, and well written.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|I don't type well and do not like to do this.  Please let me beg off.  This IS ridiculous.  Now.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This does provide a good workout and I like the routine of it - 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, 1 minute abs.  However if you aren't used to these moves then you are likely too sore to do the same routine day after day.  I am supplementing with similar moves that work different muscle groups but following the same basic plan.  Just started so I can't give a statement about results but I will try to update this review when my 30 days are up:)<br /><br />Also you have to purchase a separate book for diet plans.  This is a workout only video.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have played this game on my mac and I think it is excellent on Android as well.  Love it.
1781162646|5.0|When it comes to murder, Stephen King has been killing every other \\"serious\\" American novelist on the list of the greats, with his recent books. He's so good. And Joyland is one more slaughterhouse of amazing prose, romance, longing, grief and nostalgia few other contemporary novelists can match.<br /><br />What a show-off -- to be able to write this well about a poignant time in the past and then to top it off, to insist on the book appearing only in Old School paper, rendering us all the more nostalgic for our early days as paperback readers and demonstrating that the medium really IS the message.<br /><br />Perhaps this will be a #spoiler for some readers, but just be amazed at some of these lines he scribbles so casually, spoiling the reader with simple, elegant, emotional prose.<br /><br />\\"When it comes to the past, everyone writes fiction.\\"  (p. 43)<br /><br />\\"If you read a whodunit or see a mystery movie, you can whistle gaily past whole heaps of corpses, only interested in finding out if it was the butler or the evil stepmother. But these had been real young women.\\" (p. 201)<br /><br />\\"We saved the best ride for last, didn't we?\\" (p. 248)<br /><br />Buy this book. Read this book.  Good luck leaving it behind, it has an eerie way of revisiting you.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I read this book in seventh grade and it was interesting to read it from an adult stand point. Thanks
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Highly unlikely legal maneuvers, but still keeps your attention and imagination going. Better than most TV shows.There will  be a season 3 ,so there must be lots of viewers.
0671449028|5.0|The rhyme is really sweet and calming (&#34;The moon is high, the sea is deep. they rock, and rock, and rock to sleep&#34;). The book is smaller and lighter than Goodnight Moon, so it's easier for baby to hold.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game!!!!! It would be more fun if they had all of the things on xbox but  overall it is a awesome game:)
B007FY9ZWI|3.0|This program runs real well, No problems found. But I have uninstalled this program, may contain a virus according to Armor for Android
B0048WQDIE|5.0|I first read &#34;Catch-22&#34; in 1965, when I was with the 93rd Evac Hospital in Viet Nam. Our psychiatrist was the first to read it, and his laughter inspired the rest of us to follow suit. It struck frighteningly close to home then as it does now, and it is as hilarious now, after four readings, as it was at the first reading. The book rambles and weaves through a labyrinth of characters and stories. At times it seems as if the author has lost his way, but each time he returns to a situation previously alluded to, he does it with purpose, and usually with a bit more exposition.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Good stuff. I really really really like it. Good stuff. Awesome good stuff. Can't complain. Just like the original Mario
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Great app. Easy to use, awesome display and it makes easier to handle schedules and tasks all in one! Hands down!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator plus app does what I need it to without extras that are unnecessary and confusing. It is user friendly. I love the big buttons. I would recommend this app to anybody who is just doing simple every day functions.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|2nd time I have seen it.  Watched it with my son and he wanted to watch it again right after the credits started rolling.  Robert Downey Jr as Ironman is the best!!!
B005544V6A|5.0|I love this show. It's impossible for me to stop watching it. It's a must watch for sure. Very good quality on amazon too.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Excellent movie. Looks a bit Indie. Not your typical Hollywood Blockbuster. Cast is great. Worth a watch for sure !!
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|This has been one of the most engaging reads I've seen in a while. There were a few times that I felt the author was somewhat over his head (as in survival skill description)... But other than that this book was great!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My little brother and I love this game it's fun it's great it's awesome I love it and I hope you love it
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I was really surprised at this movie. I thought it was just gonna be another tom cruise action movie but it turned out to be an original sci-fi movie with a good plot and good actors. I suggest watching it twice because there are a lot of details but it keeps you guessing.
B001Q4Z5Z4|3.0|Since I saw it last out of the 3 movies, I was trying to figure out the logic of the second two.  It is like a souped up kill version of Fast and Furious.<br /><br />Considering that a few of the actors might have played characters in both, it is kind of wild.  What were the writers thinking?  Is there any crossover thing going on there?
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love, love, love this game!!!  It keeps me entertained for hours on end and I always look forward to plalying it again and again.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I have been waiting to find a chimney this size.  Great when all you want to barbeque is a couple of hamburgers or steaks.
140006922X|3.0|It is a good read if you like history.  As much as the author tries to leave his assumptions and opinions out of the book, he fails.  He stated on an interview that he may be Muslim, but his wife and inlaws are Christian and he has 20 years in Theology and he is a Historian.  And for the most part, his assumptions were based on vague historical accounts.  But he can not say that some were just that, assumptions.  And to me an assumption is an opinion.  As a Christian, it strengthened my faith to know some things about Jesus that were quite irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.  But I really enjoyed to learn about the writings of the Bible, and why they are there.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I like this because not too much drama and lots of good music.  I especially liked the Bruno Mars song.  This is even better if you have a sound system attached to your TV.
1609611543|1.0|I thought it was weak.  I might have expected too much from this small book.  It just was not convincing or given me any great insight as expected.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everything I was hoping to see and more.  I loved it! It just keeps getting better and better each session.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great second book. Followed the story line well. I enjoyed reading it as much as the first one. Now reading the final book and anticipate it being great also.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Simple interface and good use of colors.  Have not noticed much time added to phone life but Samsung tablets seem to last longer.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Those familiar with the works of King will enjoy the fiction mixed with fact that King renders so eloquently. Enjoy!!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|It you are looking for something that helps you to predict your mind while you are typing then yu should consider this product. The predictive text works great. It may or may not result in increase of typing speed, but for sure reduce the time you need to type.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not at all a Zombie movie fan, the fact that there are soo many out there and how cheesey theyre becoming makes me lose interest in them, but the Walking Dead is very good!<br /><br />Its one of those shows I cant stop watching, I dont have cable but I do plan on getting it (unless I can get season 4 episodes as it airs on here) to watch season 4.<br /><br />....also helps to have a little &#34;eye candy&#34; aka Daryl ;)
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|We loved the music from the movie; it added authenticity to the script.  The CD will not disappoint as the quality is very good.  Provides a nice background during the dinner hour.
B005DD7H50|4.0|The acting is great, the story is entreating, and the composition of the film is greatly appreciated. This movie keep it's viewers focus and anticipation.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show should be more popular than it is. It's fantastic. It's funny, sarcastic and dramatic. The music is good and the characters wardrobe's are exceptional.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love  this  ham  because of the graphics and how it's free an  you can go to eliminate machos lair and it was just amazing so do judge it it's
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show should be more popular than it is. It's fantastic. There are some lulls toward the end of season two here and there but for the most part it's full throttle. It's funny, sarcastic and dramatic. The music is good and the characters wardrobe's are exceptional.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I have watched this series when it was first on TV and now I am watching it again. I love the concept and the stories of this TV series. Dean Anderson's sense of humor and the other character's unique qualities makes the stories entertaining and exciting. You never know what each episode will be about or what twists and turns the story may take. I was hooked from the pilot episode and I am not surprised the series lasted for over ten seasons.
0770437400|5.0|And that statement isn't an exaggeration. Yes, it's a zombie book, but it's incredibly well written and a fresh take on horror. And it's nothing whatsoever like the movie.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The ads are only for other games sold by this same company on the splash screen, and you only see them when you first start the game. I don't personally have a problem with them, they have to stay in business to keep making games, and G5 makes some of the best games for tablets. I love Mahjong and the Artifacts series are the best ones I have come across in the Amazon App store. I was really happy to see this as the free app of the day today and immediately grabbed it. I already had Artifacts 2, but not the first one. I paid for Artifacts 2 and I would buy this version too, if it was not free today. The graphics are first rate and display great on the Kindle Fire HD. There is a nice little tutorial when you first start the game that shows all the screen controls. The tile sets are nicely done in a good variety. The story line for the quest is interesting and fun and make the game more enjoyable than just playing to clear boards with no goal. I like the music in the back ground, but it would be nice if they added a few different song themes for variety. All in all the best Mahjong game I have played on the Kindle Fire.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  I think it's the best Pixar movie yet.  I've played it for my grandkids and they love it too.  Great combination of heartfelt emotions, adventure and compassion.  Winner, winner!
B000VZUWZW|5.0|My wife and I watch very little TV, and when we do watch, it's mostly documentaries and college football. But I have to say that I've been watching TV shows since 1951, and I've seen a lot of comedy series come and go, and Big Bang Theory is consistently the funniest one that I've seen in more than fifty years, and that includes my previous favorite, I Love Lucy.<br /><br />If you're one of the few TV watchers who hasn't seen Big Bang Theory, start with the pilot show. It gives a good overview of the five main characters at the beginning of the series, and sets the tone for everything that follows. Watch the show, and you'll be hooked like we were.
B008JFUO72|1.0|This DVD is definitely not worth it. One of the big disappointments in my opinion was the way they treated the Mandarin. Iron Man's deadliest enemy and a popular villain from Marvel turns out to be a joke. Instead of the mastermind he was portrayed in the comics, here he's a washed up actor pretending to play the villain while the character Killian was the real deal. Great disappointment, especially when the rings didn't come to life. The rings were the trademark of the Mandarin and the reason why he became popular. That would have been great having the rings become the weapons they are known to be.
0321898648|5.0|After reading numerous reviews, I opted for the print edition of the Aperture training book, including the CD. The book is easy to follow and covers all aspects of file management, organization, editing, and publishing. All sample photos for the exercises are included on the CD and import easily into Aperture. Excellent format and content organization.

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Every episode I watch it makes it that much harder to not watch the following episode immediately after ! Definitely NOT one that you fall asleep or lose interest.
B00C5R8364|3.0|Not great; not terrible. The character development was mediocre at best, they all lacked any real depth; therefore, it was difficult to really become emotionally attached to any of them.  The plot was weak and predictable.  Not Forsyth's best...
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|You don't see a lot of horror movies anymore. Oh sure, you see lots of movies with obnoxious characters meeting messy, violent ends, but that is more revolting than horrifying.<br /><br />So \\"The Conjuring\\" has a strangely timeless, old-school feel to its story -- the entire first half of the movie is devoted to building up the creeping, shadowy feeling that something terrible is lurking just out of sight, followed by a second half of nightmare fuel. That second half is a bit less gripping, but still pretty good vintage horror.<br /><br />Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger Perron (Ron Livingston) move into a rather shabby farmhouse with their five daughters. Almost immediately, strange things start happening -- their dog is killed, birds crash into the house, Carolyn finds inexplicable bruises on her body, and the children are tormented by mysterious things in their bedroom. Then Carolyn is locked in the basement by a ghost.<br /><br />Desperate for help, Carolyn begs paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) to come see her house. They immediately conclude that there is a supernatural force at work here, and that it should be exorcised. But the malevolent forces in the Perron house are working fast, and the Warrens may have to take matters into their own hands to save the family.<br /><br />\\"The Conjuring\\"  feels like a much older movie than it actually is -- the slightly faded sepia tone, the lack of sex and gore, the old farmhouse with peeling paint, and the antique furniture wreathed in shadows. And with no initial explanation of just WHAT is haunting the Perron family, you're left wondering what is going on.<br /><br />That sense of mystery is what makes the first half of the movie so intensely spooky -- nothing is seen. Instead, James Wan builds up a slow, creeping sense of horror that seeps into the most innocent of actions, using things that you cannot see -- a nasty smell, a shuffling in the dark, a mysterious bruise,  a tugging on a kid's leg, an unseen specter lurking behind a door.<br /><br />In fact, the second half is less effectively horrific because we actually start SEEING things (people yanked around on wires, ghosts vomiting themselves into someone's mouth). The movie's biggest flaw is that early on, the Warrens declare that ghosts don't possess people... and yet they never mention this declaration when TA-DA! an evil ghost is found. It's a bit confusing.<br /><br />It also has uniformly amazing performances -- Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are amazing as the professional demonologists, believing that this is a God-given duty. But they give some nice nuance to their characters, with Ed's concern over his wife's well-being and Lorraine's serene awareness of the supernatural.<br /><br />And they have equally good performances by Livingston and Taylor, nice ordinary people who find themselves in the grip of something dark and malevolent. And the kids who play their daughters prove that there are excellent child actors out there -- the scene where Joey King tearfully whispers about \\"something behind the door\\" is enough to make your spine creep.<br /><br />\\"The Conjuring\\" shows a bit too much in its second half, but it doesn't stop this quietly atmospheric movie from being astoundingly creepy -- partly because of what we never see,ugging on a kid's leg, an unseen specter lurking behind a door.<br /><br />In fact, the second half is less effectively horrific because we actually start SEEING things (people yanked around on wires, ghosts vomiting themselves into someone's mouth).

B008RA3X5E|5.0|I enjoy waking to music, but radio channels can be haphazard at best.  The music selection is fantastic.  If you like classical, you will love this program.  It was also very user friendly to program and operate and the price was great.
B00C7E3EFU|4.0|I watched this for the first time in many years the other night with my teenage daughter, who had been highly unimpressed a few months ago when we saw John Carpenter's The Thing and kept complaining about the special effects. The Fog, which had a budget of just $1 million, relies more on suggestions and shadows and a sense of suspense and is actually a much scarier movie. The plot is simple; the night before the small California coastal town of San Antonio prepares to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding, strange things start to happen. Gas pumps start pumping gas for no reason, car alarms suddenly go off, clock faces shatter. A mysterious fog rolls in towards the shore and three fishermen unfortunate to be caught up in the mist come to very bad ends. It turns out that 100 years earlier, a rich man had offered lots of gold to the local priest in exchange for permission to set up a leper colony near by. The priest secretly caused the ship with the lepers to break up on near by rocks and then stole the gold and helped found the town. A century later the lepers are back and they are not best pleased. I won't say anything more about the plot. Carpenter and his team do well and the film certainly stands the test of time. What I also liked was the additional feature in which Carpenter reveals the first version of the film sucked and wasn't anywhere near scary enough. So as the distribution date approached rapidly they had to add a pile of new shots. You'd never know it though. Highly recommended.

B00006I53S|5.0|It is hard to tell that this lens has been used; it is clean and scratch free.<br /><br />It works just like I had hoped.
B003GK21U8|5.0|I loved this story. It was really exciting and riveting. I love WW2 stories and this one is out of the top drawer !
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I haven't really enjoyed this type of excellent music and voice in one place before.  Vince as usually just can't get any better  and Paul is the perfect backup for these songs.  The cover says so much of the time frame for these Merle and others originals.  I give it 5 stars. It's well worth playing over and over.
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|This is my favorite version of the Arthurian legends.  I like seeing the characters as they become the people we are so familiar with.

B0030V0PEW|5.0|As a fighter pilot (for 25 years), I fully appreciate the value of checklists. As the author points out so well, checklists enhance safety in airplanes, operating rooms, and construction sites. They also can play an important role in leadership. The book, Rules and Tools for Leaders, which Brigadier General Jeff Foley recently  published, contains checklists on hiring, firing, running meetings, managing electronic devices among others. For the purpose of full disclosure I helped Jeff with this book. In sum, The Checklist Manifesto is so well written, with so many fine examples, it can be of value to any and all.

B00DL47RQ2|5.0|Glancing at the fifteen-odd reviews before mine, more than one describes writer-director Woody Allen's 2013 film BLUE JASMINE as \\"his best in a long time\\" or \\"best in quite a while.\\"  Isn't that what people said about Allen's MIDNIGHT IN PARIS, which came out in 2011, two years earlier?  Is that a long time or really quite a while between making great films?<br /><br />What a nice problem to have, contributing such an impressive body of work that there is no one to top but yourself.  I, for one, take high expectations a Woody Allen title but he usually meets or exceeds them.  Except for TO ROME WITH LOVE, with which I have yet to catch up, the last of his films I did not like enough to view more than once was CASSANDRA'S DREAM, from 2007.  I will see BLUE JASMINE a second time, maybe a third.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett was only in one film I knew, an Indiana Jones flick, before starring in BLUE JASMINE.  I don't remember her in the Jones movie but won't forget her in this one.  If Blanchett does not get an Oscar nomination, then Meryl Streep will have to have had all the other female lead roles in 2013.  It would not surprise me to see supporting cast members Andrew Dice Clay and Bobby Cannavale receive acting nominations, too.<br /><br />Oh, so what's BLUE JASMINE about?  It's about kidding yourself by way of kidding others and hoping you get home before midnight, when your carriage turns into a pumpkin.<br /><br />See BLUE JASMINE.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|You can't remake a movie that's over 50 years old with the old language and hip current stars. It's a travesty.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I ordered this and the book when they were released.  Local stores were sold out but we used Prime and got this very quickly.  Great movie for kids.  Good songs and dancing.
B00COCY67A|5.0|I had most of the music featured on this collection on the \\"Walk A Mile In My Shoes\\" box set and the Rhythm And Country\\" single c.d. Well, believe it or not the sound quality on this 3 c.d. set is even better.  The stereo separation and musical detail clarity is stunning. It makes one feel that the King and his band are in your living room. The packaging is beautiful and very creative.  The set comes in a book size holder and has a 44 page booklet.  The booklet is full of recording detail and pictures.  The compact discs are housed in a separate 3 panel cardboard folder which has pictures of the tape boxes where the masters were located. There is one problem with the folder. The discs are held in with a sticky substance and are a bit difficult to get out for the first time. I do recommend that  a compact disc cleaning product be used before the discs are played for the first time. Once the discs are cleaned no further problems will occur.<br /><br />As for the music itself expect 1970's production full of effect laden guitars and backing vocalists.  Of course, not every song/performance is really worth repeated listening. However, I really enjoyed 80% of the material and I think that some of the outtakes were better than the finished masters.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Such a fun movie! Very original!  The animation was just as entertaining as the story.  Great for the whole family!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Use this every night as a clock! The alarms are accurate and wake me up just fine. Display is easy to read and the adjustable brightness ensures it isn't too bright.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|Good movie it brings to life what most can only begin to imagine in the world of Jay Gatsby when reading the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it! So fun! I even have the second best high score! My friend is first. My favrite app. Dave!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is an excellent game for everyone from young kids to adults to play. It helps with spacial reasoning and is pretty fun. My only complaint would be that it is somewhat short, but as I was using it more levels were added, so I am sure the length will not be a problem in the future.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I am a 27 year old male who has been training for about 10 years. I read Mike's book 5 months ago and in the past five months I have made more progress than I have in the past ten years. Concise, easy to read, exposes all the myths of useless supplements and high rep workout regimes often proposed by personal trainers in gyms. If you read this book properly, follow carefully the allocated foods, calorie range and protein:carb:fat ratio for your desired goals and lift heavy, you will see huge progress. I would recommend this book to anyone who is training but not seeing the desired results. A brilliant book!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I enjoy that this game has you release them and then collect more so you don't just fill it up once.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This was a game I downloaded for my Great-grandson.  He loves the game, and plays it more than all the games I downloaded for him.
B00008G7UF|5.0|Love that it takes place in France! Great story, the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline is unbelievable!  Great ending too!
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|I'd always heard Phillip K. Dick mentioned in the pantheon of sci-fi writers like Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke and Le Guin. But even though these authors are some of my favorites, I'd never read anything by Mr. Dick. So I decided it was time. When I researched his works, I found that Ubik is considered one of his best and that Time magazine had named it one of the 100 all-time novels (written during Time's publication years 1923-2005).<br /><br />Starting out, I wondered why. While the plot and world building were intriguing, I found the writing a bit clunky (lots of adjectives and made-up words) and the attempt at future technology dated. (not surprising--it was written in 1969 and takes place in 1992). The style reminded me of a sci-fi version of a Phillip Marlowe detective story--a bit clich&eacute; even though it may have been the prototype for the clich&eacute;.<br /><br />But as the book progressed, the mood took hold of me, an unsettling feeling like the kind you get in those seconds between dreaming and awakening, when you struggle to figure out which is which. By the end, I knew I'd been treated to a great book, a complex, well-crafted and intertwined story of multiple realities, none of which is ever grounded enough to let you sort through them. But there's something more: these realities make you question your sense of life, like The Matrix without the machines, a floating reality that is the state of being itself.<br /><br />The ideas rather than the characters are central to this story. Most of the characters are pretty flat. But once you get used to the world (psychic powers, colony on the moon, dead people in half-life), the mood takes over, as what appears to be reality fluctuates and changes.<br /><br />It's a slow start, but as I stuck with it, I found it well worthwhile, an original work with a deeply unsettling feel. Think Kafka plus Twilight Zone in the Matrix.<br /><br />Down-to-earth folks whose world view is grounded in what they perceive to be reality should probably avoid this book. But despite some rough edges, I found it to be a great read.eality should probably avoid this book. But despite some rough edges, I found it to be a great read.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|This game was fun, but after a while once you have mastered the technique for winning, playing it against the AI becomes boring.
B007AL48UK|5.0|THE GAME IS GREAT.Only complaint is that it freezes up a few times every day,but that doesn't keep me away.
B00D8HNQZI|5.0|What I wanted from this latest album was some of the same and something different.  They delivered just that in the perfect way, that I didn't feel I was cheated on either aspect.  Same signature sound is present along with new instrumentation that should please most fans.  So glad I snagged this.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game, sometimes I say I am only going to play 10 to 15 minutes and I find I have been plays for a hour and a half.  We keeps me occupied between appointments.
B009O07NMA|5.0|album is great! easy listening to jam out to. i play it at work. the songs are good outside the big ones on the radio
B005LAII80|5.0|What can I say but by this Movie.<br />It is fantastic. Probably one of the best adaptations to a comic you will ever see.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|His development of this story is amazing.  The characters came alive and the &#34;hero&#34; was so believable.  Delightful book to read.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like this game and this one is nice because the tiles that are available are highlighted. I would recommend.
B00CP4GSGO|5.0|I've always been a fan of Zimmer's LP pressings and this one had floored me.  The CD left me feeling the music was too tight, not open enough so when I opened the vinyl and played it, immediately there was the bigger soundstage.  I felt like I was finally listening to the instruments around me and not all pressed together.  This is way vinyls should be.  Will forever by Zimmer LP's
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like this book I like the people in the book I will like is book it makes me happy.
B004EPYZOO|3.0|This is an entertaining movie at best. I will definitely never win any academy awards but as far as fun movie it has all the right tools.

B001NHNG64|5.0|Jack Reacher is an exciting Character and the book is hard to put down. I've read several of Lee Child's books and enjoyed every one.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Profound mixture of science, humanity, and great writing.<br />Kudos and thanks to Dr. Mukherjee for doing this.<br />It shows why doctors do what they do.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Best $27 ever spent.  Love the built in EQ's which seem to work better than my phone or computer EQ.  Sound from my AKG headphones is amazing now.  I was on the verge of returning them and decided to spend the money to try them amped.  This made all the difference in the world.  The amp is incredibly small, about the size of a pack of matches.  It charges very fast and seems to run forever.<br /><br />My only word of advice MAKE SURE YOU BUY FROM AN AUTHORIZED RESELLER!!  For the extra $2 it's worth the piece of mind.
0307586901|5.0|There was some slight wear to the cover, but that often happens when someone ships a book.  The corners usually aren’t covered.  The recipient of this gift loved it and used it right away.  This is a good gift for a craft lover.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is easily one of the best TV series on tv. I just wish we didn't have to wait so long for season 4.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This makes your brain work and what fun it is. You can challenge yourself on levels that you did not get a perfect score on. Great game.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|already been thru every episode of the whole series once. just goin back to see if theres anything i may have missed. love it!
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this game. It's creative and fun. Sadly I've had to skip a puzzle because I couldn't wrap my head around it...oh well I guess you can't win them all.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|over all pretty good game. except you might want too spend real money together to some of the locked items
0689835604|5.0|GREAT BOOK! I read this everyday to my toddlers and they just absolutely LOVE it! I am so glad I bought this book for one amazing price! Thanks!
B008OM0EDO|5.0|This movie is of terrible taste and is extremely offensive.  Some of the movie's scenes are truly trash.  Five stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game. play it almost every day. it would be even better if it had hunger bars or animal spawning naturally. but still great game
B005UG542S|4.0|Great movie....Better then the others 4 to 1, everyone should watch the series at least once. No problems with the streaming and of good quality
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|My husband loves this movie! I got it for him for his birthday. He quotes some of the lines so I thought it would make a gift. He was very happy!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I've been using the product for 2 weeks and it has worked flawlessly.  I'm running Windows 8 and did not need to use the supplied drivers on the included disk.  The drivers were updated automatically.  It functions and performs exactly as expected.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Interesting prequel for sure! The back story was intriguing and the actors were interesting. Great visual effects throughout the movie.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Graphics good. Fun game. Works well on Kindle Fire. I only accept basic use & don't pay for the extras
6305428387|5.0|Even when one considers the dramatic liberties taken with this otherwise true story, this is a tale to tug even at the toughest heartstrings.  Jamaica plays what may very well be the ultimate underdog when four men and their coach form the year-around warm country's first bobsled team and travel to the Winter Olympics in the hope of bringing home the gold.  This is one of John Candy's films that proves that he passed on way too soon.  Even if you know this story backwards and forwards, you won't be able to help but root for Jamaica to take it all the way.  A must-have for anyone who likes sporting movies.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This story is more about life than racing. I am uplifted by it! I am inspired by it! I find it entirely plausible!
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|There are tons of toys literally littering my kids toy box. Little pieces, I should say. Let's be honest, toys are just, for the most part, not very durable. When I was a kid, toys lasted forever, easily taking the beating I would dish out over long hot summer days, not to mention the rush of new toys on Christmas morning.<br /><br />The Schleich Dragon Rider Toy reminds me of those toys, in so far as how durable it is. The little rider guy is removable, and the wings are both easily removed and put back with no problem. And none of that weakening after repeated on/off operations.<br /><br />My son loves this toy. He has played with it almost non-stop since I gave it to him. The packaging was easy to open. The toy itself is heavy, at least the dragon is. It feels solid, well built. While pricy for a toy of this nature, the level of detail and craftsmanship justifies the price.<br /><br />Schleich Dragon Rider Toy is a good toy, one that will last a very long time!
B004LWZW42|5.0|I loved this movie! It is by far the best X-Men yet. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender make the perfect Professor X and Magneto, at a young age. This is a must own for both X-Men fans, and fans of the Marvel universe as well!
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|I love Buddy Guy, so I was looking to be pleased, but I was surprised at just how good this CD is, he seems to have kicked it up yet another notch, and I didn't think there was one. Great songs, some really interesting writing, great cameos, particularly Steven Tyler.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Got to a level I couldn't complete & you can't skip ahead. But it's an interesting game. That is my opinion.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|I have been reading Jane Austen since I was in High School.  This is one I've missed and I'm very pleased to have found it here.  I was not disappointed at all!
B005544V6A|5.0|A series to watch! Smart dialogue, adult, witty and fast paced. Intelligent, handsome characters that are real and relatable. Nice!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|My husband and I have only recently become fans of &#34;Castle&#34;. Of all the episodes we have seen this one really hit home with us because of the soap opera storyline. We also love the way the main characters play off one another. This is a classic!
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I had lost my financial calculator in the middle of the process of preparing the numbers to purchase a piece of equipment. I ordered on a Monday and have it Wednesday.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game is great. It plays really fast and you have the option to share your score with others online. You can't go wrong with this!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|For me it like the Tetris I always wanted to play. I can make a mistake and move the piece to correct it. HIGHLY recommended fr any one that loves a GREAT puzzle game.
0788859544|1.0|This DVD arrived completely scratched up and we couldn't even watch it. I returned it for refund the next day. My daughter was very upset.
B0000042MY|5.0|I remember listening to this soundtrack on a cassette tape growing up. I absolutely loved it then and still love it now. Whether you liked the move or not the music is just so inspiring and moving.
1780387105|5.0|Great complement to the website, the book goes into more detail, and I love that I don't have to google search the songs anymore.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Full screen and large numbers make this a very easy to use calculator. Simply love it and would recommend to all Kindle users!
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Very entertaining show full of narcecism and movie quotes as well as the new york minute feel in the pace of the show.
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|Its a good game but if you do not know how to play you will find yourself frustrated fast. If you are willing to learn you  will have hours of enjoyed play time.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I love having a good series to watch especially in the summer. It lives up to all of its reviews
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I bought their second album &#34;A Strange Case of...&#34; first and was completely blown away, so I've been snapping up anything else they've released. I don't think these guys are capable of making a dud. Everything is remarkable. Instantly my favourite next to Lacuna Coil's 'Dark Adrenalin.'
B001QB5S3G|5.0|This movie was very nice.  It takes place in Argentina at the Iguazu Falls and the setting is beautiful.  The music was outstanding and very emotionally moving. I bought the sound track after I watched the movie.  We enjoyed the movie very much but was a little disappointed in the ending.  Well worth a look see.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|My husband loves them! He uses them all the time! He mainly uses them for music when he drums! Great product for the price!
B000002UHG|4.0|Interesting recording from Rick Wright. Fills out the Pink Floyd set. Not as commercial as Roger Waters and David Gilmour
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was such a great book that I will be on pins and needles as I await the publishing of the last book of the trilogy. This first book in the trilogy was chosen by a member of a book club to which I belong. This book was chosen for this month so everyone could read it over the summer. Although I won't be at the meeting to discuss it I have passed on my thoughts to the gentleman who chose it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This was such a good book series. I am anticipating the last book in this series, The One, and can't wait for it to come out.
B00418NVMQ|5.0|This is a very impressive live performance, most notably is Lzzy Hale's incredible vocal, on pitch and accurate, which is so rare these days with so many acts live, separated from their beloved autotune. This act is the real deal and has to be one of the very best on the scene. Quite remarkable actually.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun to work through the different puzzles. Should keep me busy for a very long time. Keeps the game  nteresting.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|i downloaded for my kids and i play it more than them .highly recommended,fun to play. one thing more moves
B00DBQ0AV4|2.0|Anna Netrebko had a lovely voice for some bel canto roles at the start of her career. But she lost her thin coloratura and her harsh high notes and dropped many of her earlier roles, I Puritani e.g. Anna Bolena, a late acquisition for her, at the Met, shows where she is in terms of agility, legato, etc. nowhere. Her Anna was OK, but to see her mugging back stage behind Renee Fleming during the HD broadcast Intermission was not encouraging. I cannot imagine Callas or Caballe doing this between the acts. What this says is that she didn't care about this role of Anna Bolena and so winged it.It sounded under felt and she was sadly over-parted all the way through.<br /><br />The Verdi CD, much like Anna Bolena, has all of the limitations displayed that Anna Netrebko has shown in La Traviata and other Verdi offerings. It is emotionless, not interesting in any way, simply sung with equalizers at hand to smooth out the bad patches.<br /><br />I think that her Eugene Onegin at the Met this season will be better. She is more at home with her native Russian language, never comfortable with Italian or French or whatever.<br /><br />Another example of a diminution in her voice was last season's L'Elisir d'Amore...not a high note, not a trill, no fioritore, as with Anna Bolena. Careening all over the stage running from the truth that the score kept screaming at her...drop this role!<br /><br /> Lovely things in other roles, chiefly Russian, where she can show he strong middle and robust top with feeling.<br /><br />She can be  a stand out, but not in the Italian or French repertoire. Listen to Caballe and Callas and Freni and Price(L,).. experience the beauty and the genius.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I love how every A7X album has really a unique but similar sound, I think it takes more risk and a bigger reward to create great albums with different sounds rather than try to keep doing the exact same thing.  This album follows suite and gives the listener a completely unique A7X experience.  It has a darker more metal taste but comes complete with the extras of A7X.  I enjoyed the complete album all the way through the way it was intended to be heard.  If your not completely satisfied the first time through I encourage you to give it a another chance and listened to it on a good stereo system, I played these on my phone and laptop and it was no where near the experience I had with my home theater tower speakers.<br /><br />You can't listen and start comparing it to previous songs, just listen to the song and determine if its good or not.  I am disappointed the band didn't include more creative ultra complex songs which were found on self titled and nightmare.  But this is by far some of the best new age metal I have every heard.  I don't care for Metallica thats just mean, seems simple cheesy and I never cared for the vocals.<br /><br />I will address the complete and utter dumb statement that This Means War is a ripoff of Sad But True, they show similarities but come on they are completely different songs and I much prefer This Means War, more complex, better vocals, and better intro.  If this ruins the album for you than I don't know what to say to you. I think with the amount of songs now recorded in the world you can find similarities all over the place and some from no name garage bands that came up with the riff first.<br /><br />Closing I will note I hope they include a few more creative more theatrical ultra complex songs on the next one which they included on the past couple albums.  None the less this is a great album but the less comparing you do the better the experience will be for you.  Take it for what it is, great metal.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I loved this book series. I was an easy to read quick read. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B005EIS5IW|5.0|I loved these comics. They reminded me a lot of me. My husband could also relate to some of the comics. They were very funny, and I can't wait to read more.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|Great movie! Ending was a little off, but it was still great compared to a lot of other horror films that have been coming out lately!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I had some concerns from negative reviews but am glad I rented the movie.  Fx awesome for sure and story was a benchmark.
B005SCSL56|5.0|This is a fun book to read you will go through all of the fairy tales like Cinderella and snow white you will also see red ridding hood and the big bad wolf pack. At the end you will find out a big secret in how Alex and Connor get home. So read this book it is so FUN!!!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Great game. Loved every minute of it. Played during break and got pretty good. Really addicting so be careful not to spend all your time.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Given the exclusively bleak elements he chose to work with, it is remarkable that the author could create such a strangely beautiful and hopeful tale.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|A must have book for cat lovers. Quite a few of the poems reminded me of my cat, and the crazy things he does. This made me chuckle several times.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|When it first came out ,I thought it would be to blaaaaaaa,But after getting it for my own home,I was wonderful,I would tell everone that hasn't seen it. see,it,soon.You will like it.
B00E193TM2|4.0|I purchased through amazon MP3 for 2.99 and I'm guilty. Guilty of robbery cause I feel I have cheated FFDP of the cash they deserve for delivering something that has me destroying everything in house and make people nervous when they see me screaming along with every song on this album in the rearview mirror on the highway. This album just is pure hellfire from beginning to end. Only one track I could honestly say was not my favorite and even then it will get the repeat button on any given day. This band has never disappointed and this album stands out heavily.
1932907009|5.0|Blake Snyder passed away a few years back, so I can do homage without embarrassing anyone but myself. Blake's guide is easy to read, extremely well-thought out and instructive. Blake's agenda is simple: He wants only the best for your screenwriting career. You'll experience many &#34;Aha!&#34; moments, &#34;So that's why they didn't like it!&#34; From soup to nuts, from beginning to end, this is your &#34;Bible&#34; for successful screenwriting. Enjoy!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Loved the story and found it riveting. It was slightly confusing at the beginning of some chapters when the author started speaking from a different character's voice until I figured out who it was. Otherwise, I was sorry to see it end.
B009AY04A8|3.0|This game is fun and moderately challenging. My problem with it is it's constant reference to the occult. My seven year old wants to play but I don't feel comfortable with her reading the dialogue that is constantly referencing spirits and contacting spirits and being haunted by spirits. A lot of occult symbolism in the pictures as well.
B00CO52NLI|2.0|If you like this game go ahead and buy the paid version. This free version only comes with guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits. To add the other animals adds up to $6 for all. If you buy the paid version for $3.99 all you have to pay is an additional .99 cents if you want reptiles.  It already comes with what's included in the free version plus dogs, cats, horse and birds.  It's a really fun game. Time flies when you're playing it!

B00D8HNR2K|4.0|Update: After spending some more months with this album, I upgraded the rating to 4 stars. It's a very good album, with its own distinct feel within the NIN catalog. I stand by my previous assessment that this has a lot of similarities to the HTDA material, but the album has grown on me over time to the point where I consider it better than the two HTDA albums. I doubt we'll ever hear another album like Downward Spiral from Trent, but that's okay. As he says in the song \\"Everything\\";<br /><br />\\"Wave goodbye, wish me well<br />I've become something else\\"<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />3.5 Stars<br /><br />This is by no means a bad album. In fact, I think it would have made an excellent third album for How To Destroy Angels. It features many of the same synth sounds used in the HTDA albums, and the \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" soundtrack. I purchased and enjoyed all of those records, and didn't mind Trent's change in musical direction when they came out.<br /><br />But to recycle many of those same sounds and styles for a new NIN album? It's a bit disappointing. There're definitely some classic NIN soundscapes in this album; most of them reminiscient of The Fragile and Year Zero. The larger problem is that the album as a whole feels muted, as though Trent has put his artistry behind a concrete wall, and only the bleeps, sweeps, and creeps are filtering through, while the heavy guitar riffs and corroded drumbeats have nearly been reduced to nothingness. In fact, on several songs he actually mutes his singing, much like the effect used on the second HTDA album, to the point you almost have to strain to hear the lyrics. I'll definitely be giving the album more listens, and it may grow on me, but thus far I would have preferred he had just started another new project, rather than recycling the NIN name for this album.<br /><br />Favorite songs:<br /><br />Came Back Haunted<br />Various Methods of Escape<br />I Would For You
B00ECU1A6C|4.0|I thought for sure my son would be pretty scornful of this particular movie. Because he likes everything My Little Pony, however, he enjoyed it thoroughly. I think the only reason I did not enjoy it one hundred percent was that it reminded me of uncomfortable things that happened to me in High School.<br />I wound up giving it 4 stars because I cannot deny that this was superbly written and acted. The whole story fit together well, the music was great. It lost a star for audio quality. There were 4 or 5 portions where the audio hollowed out, especially in the beginning.<br />Following the classic lines of Friendship is Magic, this is a very, very good movie for those who enjoy My Little Pony. Emphasis on forgiving others, friendship, and giving people a chance made me happy. :)
B0019IB0II|5.0|This book was a life and sanity saver after a close family member had a significant stroke.  Very very helpful !
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love the social aspect of it with my friends and family.  I live in another state from my family and am able to see pictures.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Not my favorite season but still a must have...some good episodes. the plot changes in preparation of season 3 which is awsome!<br />Just ordered season 3!!
B00C6B9XCW|5.0|The case is in fine condition, along with the discs inside. As far as the movie goes, it's fantastic. Nothing to complain about.

B002361MLA|4.0|This is a good book to read if you're doing a self-assessment.  I found a lot of meaning in many sections of the book.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I set my alarm clock to wake me up at 5:20 a.m. and I have it on repeat for the whole week, it does not repeat at all throw the week and it keeps changing the loud tone I want to wake me up to a low sound and it causes me to miss the my school bus. I had the app on my kindle fire before and it worked perfectly but now it sucks.
B00DX88GWU|5.0|This is an absolute masterpiece. The production is crystal clear, the bass is quite audible and the guitar work is magic. Mille's vocal delivery is executed with plenty of good vigour and energy. The crowd noise and chants appear in all the right places and do not distract from the music.<br /><br />I generally find live thrash albums can be a bit hit-and-miss. Not the case here. With Kreator their live efforts have been superb(check out their other live CD [[ASIN:B00006GOFU Live Kreation]]). Kreator perform like a well oiled machine on this one.<br /><br />The concert was part of a tour in support of their recent album, Phantom Antichrist. One or two of the tracks even sound better than their studio counterparts - particularly Phobia (from Outcast). If you like Kreator and you're after a live release, then this could be just what you're looking for.<br /><br />It's also available on Blu-ray and DVD via Nuclear Blast.<br /><br />Here's the full tracklisting on the 2 CD Digipak version I have:<br />(NB: There is also another version out there with a 3rd cd containing demos etc).<br /><br />CD1<br /><br />01.

B0049J2BSM|5.0|Love this- for all ages! I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone! The second movie is great too. Not AS good as the first though.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is the original Pac-Man.  I found it a bit difficult to operate on my Kindle Fire, though I'm just learning how to use it.  The thumb control is a bit hard to control so my Pac-Man goes the way I want him to.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|I like movies with a twist. I assumed the plot just by the trailers but I love the plot twist (no spoilers)
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|My 10 yr old loved the way you can change it up from 1 DeLorean to another by changing the license plate and wheels. He couldn't wait for it to come in the mail. Who would have thought a 10 year old would think something from an old movie was so awesome?

B004SBS8LA|4.0|Good game, I had heard lots about Angry Birds, but had never tried it before. It offers me something different to do occasionally.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really appreciate how intuitive this all is to use, and I like that you can put a barrier between yourself and the snooze button. Simple, smart, but still has a lot of good options.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was an easy read and an enjoyable one.  I liked that at the back of the book it gave the definitions of so many flowers.  I asked several of my friends what their favorite flowers were and they were surprised to learn what those flowers meant.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is the free version and has many levels of the original game.  I like this much better than all the new variations.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|So far this game is pretty good. Can't wait for new levels to come out and find where the uncle went to.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Another tradition of ours is to watch this film every Christmas.  It just isn't Christmas without this movie!  Buy it!
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this installment of the Bootleg Series!  Very similar to the \\"Self Portrait\\" album in that you have to not be expecting anything when listening to it!  Most people who don't like Self Portrait tend to set the standard too high and compare it to his best albums such as \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" and \\"Blonde On Blonde\\" and they get disappointed when doing that!  But if you sit back and keep an open ear for some good music you'll find plenty on \\"Self Portrait\\" and also \\"Another Self Portrait\\"!  \\"Pretty Saro\\" and \\"Tattle O'Day\\" are my favorite songs on this but I also liked \\"Railroad Bill\\", \\"Thirsty Boots\\", and \\"This Evening So Soon\\" - but all the songs are really good I think...  \\"Country Pie\\" and \\"I threw It All Away\\" sound almost identical to the versions on \\"Nashville Skyline\\" to me - I couldn't tell much difference!  I liked the version of \\"Wallflower\\" much better on this than I did on Bootleg Series Vol. 2 - and what a great country song that is!! Listening to that makes me wonder when Bob Dylan is gonna be inducted in the Country Music Hall Of Fame!!  But all in all - I think this is a great compilation of some really cool country/folk songs - I defintely recommend it to anyone who loves good music!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Very fun to watch and keeps you entertained throughout.  All the characters you expect kicking butt and taking names.  Hulk smash!!

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This restoration and high definition re-release is a pleasure to discover all over again.<br /><br />This kind of production quality will be unmatched in the future. Starting with a 70mm negative, it doesn't get much better.
B001E1B6NE|5.0|One of the best Christmas films ever!  I make sure I watch it every Christmas.  It isn't Christmas without this film!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a amazing game. I love it more than the other game I was playing earlier. At first I didn't think It would be this amazing until I started playing it a lot.
B00013F35I|5.0|Many complaints about video or audio quality.  If you love Bruce then watch this and be entertained.  Lots of fun songs...high energy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved every moment of this story!!  I can't wait for the next part of the saga!!!  Please don't keep me waiting!!
B003VANOFY|4.0|Works well and as advertised, but sometimes pops or crackles.  I've eliminated all possible sources of interference, yet the phenomenon persists.  Doesn't do it all of the time, just occurs intermittently and inexplicably.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Not since &#34;City of Evil&#34; has this reviewer been so excited about an Avenged Sevenfold recording. It's all in place here. Giant drums, awesome guitar tones with just the right amount of shredding. But the true star here is Matt Shadows. One of the best rock singers of all time, this is surely his best work to date. If I could give this record ten stars, I would.
B003YCIE68|5.0|I took my children to see this movie at the theatre when it first came out and I can say I felt that I was transported to the North Pole. My kids loved it too and it's become a tradition in my home to watch it every Christmas....and the kids are now adults!
B00CFYAT6O|3.0|This review is for those of you who listened to Ms Tedeschis<br />\\"Just Won't Burn\\".  The raw, rockin' nature of some of those cuts, such as Rock Me Right, promised a talent that would provide toe tappin', sing along with the refrain albums for years to come.  \\"Made Up Mind\\" is competent, pleasant and nice enough.  But I found my attention wandering by the end.  Ms Tedeschis vocals are refined, in check, almost sweet.  There are not enough guitar solos to highlight Mr. Trucks' talent.  This album doesn't burn or engage.  Where is the harsh, hard blues/rock from Just Won't Burn?  You won't find it here.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This show depicts several classes of people's ordinary lives. The show is very well made in that through many little tidbits in lives, it showed a lot of goodness in people. It is heart warming and very pleasant, and at times, very moving. It is witty and entertaining as well. I loved it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was hoping google would be a more open platform. Alas, they just locked the door last week (the day my Chromecast arrived). You can no longer stream your own media files and can only use their pre-determined video sources. Completely useless for me. Returned....
B005ZOCF5E|5.0|Multiple adventures from Earth, to the moon, to Mars, to the asteroid belt and beyond.  Gripping story, hard to put the book down.
B007STBUIW|5.0|The movie is still great and the picture looks and sounds excellent in BD. I enjoyed hearing the many great lines and speeches again.<br />I haven't checked out all of the extras yet, but watched part of the 'making of' included on the disk. It's interesting and fun to watch too.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I debated reading this book because of its length but I decide to tackle it anyway.  I shouldn't have!  It's just much too long.  See the movie instead!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Don't be put off by the subject matter - this is a lovely story of a family's will to stay together.  Yes, some of the scenes are harrowing, but the director (and screenwriter) handle it all beautifully.  The performances are wonderful all around; the children are amazing.  It's really too bad this didn't get the audience it deserves.  I watched it with my daughter and 14 year old grandson, and for days after one or the other of us would suddenly say, \\"That was SUCH a good movie!\\".
B004UB2KRG|4.0|A follow up to the secret with basically the same messages just concentrating on more specific things and ways to achieve these things. It's a lovely book to have as is the secret and is well written and easy to read.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Love this entire series! Can't wait to read the rest of them! Cassandra Clare is amazing! Love the detail she adds!
B00005JLR8|4.0|Wanted to see some more of Samantha Morton's work, and I did.<br /><br />This is a nice movie, though I think the 'feelgoodness' of it is a bit contrived.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very well written.  I have a son stationed in Afghanistan now in the US ARMY, even though I don't agree with our Military being in Afghanistan, the book was very interesting and well written.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|new appreciation for Matthew McConaughy.  loved his role in this movie.  it was very slow and very long but worth the story.  thoroughly enjoyed it
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I especially appreciated Chapter 5 that summed up my Great Grandparents experience - Louis and Regina Borgenicht!  Gladwell's first two books were great as well. Well worth the time to read them!
B00BJKYM40|5.0|This is a fun and enlightening read.<br /><br />He is truly a talented author. this book is not usually my taste but I would recommend it to anyone. It is a fun and easy read and gives a new perspective to human life.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love how easy the app was to install and that it linked up with my account on my pc. The books are quick to download and easy to read!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this app I got temple run 2  but I like this more my highest scores is like 2 million now this is a great app
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|It just takes so long to get anywhere.  It focuses on what i'd consider no storyline for a long time.  We didn't wait.  Plus it has the tone of a musical which we don't like.
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|The comedy relief was excellent (it's always worth starting out with a positive).<br /><br />The rest, not as much, though I only have enough energy to sum up the most pressing points.<br /><br />Loki, for all his setup as the main villain, is an obvious pawn himself, and we get no payoff of his bosses getting what's coming to them other than a nuke exploding them all. His final act is acting petulant and getting beaten up as a comedy note.<br /><br />Far far too much time is spent on the \\"getting the band together\\" section for characters we already have enough backstory on from their other movies, and it's 45min left in an over 2 hour movie before we get to the final action sequence (they dragged out the fighting part of the ship combat far too long and gave far too little time to the transition between it and the final sequence). For comparison, I have to think of Advent Children (the FF7 spinoff) as a similarly structured action movie with similar pre-established characters, and it managed far more interesting sequences and in far less time in the name of moving things toward the finale.<br /><br />Finally, the idea that Nick Fury could get away with half of what he did (or that the shadowy figures themselves don't have some level of ability to track the Avengers (including Iron Man who everyone knows is involved but can go back to his life as-is somehow?)) is just silly and makes the \\"wait till we have a sequel\\" ending all the more sour, good pyrotechnics aside. If I wanted to actively sit down and watch an action movie I've seen before, this is near the bottom of my list (right above movies I was forced to sit through in various parts of my young life and that I didn't seek out like this one).
B007TK77QE|4.0|It is amazing how from a simple day to day small town occurence, an excellent writer can create a compelling story! Kept me wanting to read to the end.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love to play uno! My grandkids love it too! An awesome game for people of all ages to play!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Why did I choose this  rating? This story stayed with me for a couple of days after I've finished the book. I was sad when the story ended and I wanted it to on and on. Sorry that Will was no longer with Lou, I wanted their relationship to go on and on ,I want to read more of them. An easy to read novel where you get so engrossed in the life's of the 2 families. If you look past the ethical issue of the end of the story,this is a great live story and not your usual soppy, romantic love story.
B007SGM084|4.0|I heard all about the hype and was skeptical. As I  starting reading, I found the story surprisingly interesting and intriguing.  Great summer read.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Didn't see what was coming till nearing the end. Kept you in suspense. Good movie. Rent it and you won't be sorry
B00CATONCA|5.0|Very nice Limited Edition, although a bit smaller than I had imagined. Looks great alongside my season 2 Zombie Head. Only slight problem I had was with opening the battery compartment. I used a smallish Philips screwdriver but it just seemed to take the groove off the screwhead and I had a hell of a job getting it out. I managed to do it eventually but I have now got to get a new screw to fit it!! Would have been much better if it had had just a slide and click cover like most battery things do these days. Apart from that I am very pleased with it and of course there are no complaints with the series 'cause that is just brilliant anyway. A fantastic addition to my collection.
B00127RAJY|4.0|First up, it will work for most people - regardless of gender/age etc. That's the good news. Personally, I lost 4 pounds over the 30 days, but I was combining this with other exercise plans to do an hour a day for five out of seven days/week. I'm not convinced weight is the best metric, but it also helped shift inches so the impact on the critical body fat percentage is also good. On top of the fact that it will work, it's pretty easy to fit into your day - you only need 30 minutes or so, including warm up and cool down. That's not unmanageable. Her concept is three minutes of strength, two minutes of aerobic, one minute of core three times. So psychologically you always know where you are and can see the light at the end of the tunnel. She offers three different workouts (she likes the number three) with the implication that you do each for ten days before moving onto the next. They do get progressively more challenging so at least the first time through, that's the way to do it as you need to build up a bit to the next level. Even for the moderately active, it's a challenging workout - and level 3 in particular is an excellent workout.<br /><br />What you will need are some hand weights (light is fine), ideally a good mat (esp for level 3) - thick if you have dodgy knees and possibly pushup stands if you have weak wrists as she does like to have you in plank a lot. One of the backing bouncers does a slightly lower impact version, but the differences are modest.<br /><br />So there are a lot of positives. There are also some negatives though. Some won't apply to everyone. If you respond best to shouty coaches, you are in luck here. She does shout and generally seems rather angry. The soundtrack is awful so after you get familiar with the routine, it's best to pump up your own music (you cannot turn the music off unfortunately) which also has the advantage of drowning out shouty Jillian for me. She also fails to understand that we can only hear her and not her two friends so laughs maniacally when they say something apparently funny - hashtag awkward, as some would say. Most irritatingly, every time you fire up the DVD you have to listen to her self-promotion for several minutes before you get to the main workout menu. That's fine the first couple of times. Thereafter, it is infuriating.<br /><br />Her strength work is potentially the most challenging. She likes to work upper body while keeping the lower body engaged in stress positions. This makes it particularly sensitive to the weight you are lifting - I struggled at first because I was lifting the same weights I would normally lift for these moves but because you are in a stress position you need to go a bit lighter. Thus lighter weights are probably better and will allow you to keep better form. This is another minor gripe - she and her backing bouncers use one set of weights throughout but I found that the different exercises required different weights to be effective. This approach has another longer term issue. It is good for aerobic workout (ie you will lose calories), less good at building lean muscle, because you are forced to use lighter weights. This means that longer term you are not building the muscle to keep fat off (muscle raises metabolism even at rest) so you will have to keep coming back to something like 30 day shred. It also seems strangely biased towards shoulders in the first two levels - maybe it improves posture so makes the impact look better?<br /><br />Also be aware that level 3 in particular involves a fair bit of plyo (ie jumping up and down) work so City-dwellers / dorm room fitness fans beware - if you have people living below you they might get a little put out. Although by this stage you should be able to out run them if the get really angry ;)<br /><br />Although short, after 10 days each level becomes so dull. As I said earlier, the first time through, you sort of have to build up to the next level. Thereafter, if you are doing the full 30days, I'd strongly suggest doing level 1, level 2, level 3 and repeat rather than ten times level 1 etc. Better yet, combine it with other workouts to keep your body from getting used to the routine. If this is the only routine you do, you will soon get bored and the danger is this will stop you exercising. But as a 30 day before you go on holiday routine - it will produce results for a modest time input if you eat sensibly as well. Jillian bangs on about the diet - with reason - but there is no specific food plan associated with this DVD - but for this price, no complaints about that.
B00B3EJ292|3.0|Poingant topic, but the flow of the movie seemed odd to me.  Not much told about the wife's struggle through it all.
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|I was real reluctant to buy this game at first. I read all the reviews and decided to get it. I am happy to say I have really enjoyed it. A rare fulfilling app from Amazon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This a great game for children, both entertain and positive reinforcing the concept of responsibility. Highly recommended for anyone thinking of getting a pet for your child.
B00DU74U74|3.0|This movie was a litte dull and slow moving. I recommend you read the book instead. It makes a better read than a sci-fi movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love love love this game! Many times I've wanted to buy bingo credits but have stopped myself...For now! :) It's typical of games like this, to get you hooked so you'll actually pay for stuff.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|It has been a long time since I watched a horror movie that gave me chills, but Sinister delivered.  Without giving too much away, it has a great premise, both psychological and jump-out-at-you thrills, and the acting was good too.  Some might find the pacing slow, but I found that it nicely built the suspense to the climax.  On the downside I found the scenes a little dark, in the lighting sense.  Even shots in the daylight felt like they were lit with a 20 watt bulb.  I know it's hard to have something jump out of the shadows if there are no shadows but I felt like turning the brightness on the TV up on several occasions just to get out of the perpetual twilight.  The fact that the characters seemed incapable of operating a light switch, even when searching their house at night, seemed excessive.  Avid horror movie watchers will also probably peg the ending, or at least narrow it down to a couple of possibilities before the climax.  Still, it's definitely worth a watch. A special note as to the music/score: it noticeably added to the suspense and movie as a whole and thus deserves special mention.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|The 3rd season of The Walking Dead is my favorite so far.  They did away with a lot of the talkiness that dragged down the first half of Season 2 and packed season 3 with lots of action.<br /><br />I had pre-ordered the Season 3 blu-ray from Amazon, but the day before the release, I saw Amazon matched Target's price of $29.99, and Target was selling a steelbook case.  It seemed like a no-brainer, so I cancelled my pre-order and headed over to Target on the day it was released.  Final verdict?  Eh - it's nothing special.  I've purchased very nice steelbooks before (Band of Brothers comes to mind), but this one just looks very cheap.  There's a good deal of plastic on the outside of the case, and the inside \\"flaps\\" are terrible - very flimsy plastic and difficult to flip.  I don't know if the regular packaging is any better, but just know that the steelcase is nothing special.<br /><br />There are some decent features on the blu-ray, but sadly, the audio commentaries are pretty lackluster.  There are commentaries for only four or five of the episodes, and none are overly insightful.  I wish they'd done a better job on the extras, but I'm so happy to own the episodes.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|I wish they'd release a new album. Rammstein puts on an awesome show!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I love the first book. The second was okay. The third was very emotional, and should tell more about what Gale did with his life
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|This movie is more about the special effects and glitz than storyline. If you want to know more about Gatsby, watch the earlier version, and pass this one up.
B003LQ3YXU|1.0|I just can't get into British programs,  I have difficulty understanding the foreign meanings. Not all British tv is bad I like Luther
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I loved it!<br />This was a great book and I was so excited for the whole thing I just wish it had not ended
B004P1JEXE|4.0|Have become engrossed and enchanted by this series of Game of Thrones books.  Always getting the next in the series when I finish the previous installment...  Always wanting to know what happens next and always shocked when I read what does happen. Mr. Martin has certainly got another big fan here.
B006H5120E|5.0|This is an epic movie. I could watch it again and again, especially in a Blu-ray format. I don't have a 3D TV, but when I do, I will also have the 3D version which is part of this package.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Amazing! Can't wait for season 3. The shows characters are so charming I've fall3n in love with all the characters, especially Schmidt.
B005MJDJQQ|4.0|I liked this mystery better than some others by Mankell because he keeps up the level of suspense throughout and is especially good on police procedural detail.

B00AFPTSI0|5.0|When it comes to business ethics, we tend to believe that self-interest is the only possible road to success:  we are under the general impression that in a 'dog-eat-dog' world, those who combine motivation and abilities with a good dose of self-protective opportunism will put their own interests ahead of other people's needs, take more than they give, and, in doing so, rise to the top of the success ladder, faster, more steadily, and more profitably than anybody else. Not according to Adam Grant, youngest tenured professor at The Wharton School (University of Pennsylvania), world's top forty business professor under forty, and award-winning researcher.<br /><br />As an advocate of positive psychology, Grant argues that greed doesn't ultimately lead to success. There is a fourth element we need to consider when analyzing the ingredients of a successful career: hard work, talent, and luck are not the only driving forces fueling high performances and productiveness. The way we interact with other people in our work environment (whether with a creative generosity and positive attitude, or with a self-centered reciprocity and self-protective ambition) is what truly defines us in our profession. Since we spend a considerable amount of our time (if not most of it) doing our job, our work becomes a fundamental part of who we are. We may, therefore, need to adopt in the workplace the same positive and altruistic values we normally reserve to our personal relationships (friendship and marriage).<br /><br />Examining professional interactions across diverse lines of work, the Wharton professor claims that we can be divided in three different behavioural categories:<br /><br />  Takers<br />  Givers<br />  Matchers<br /><br />Takers are self-focused, competitive, and always ready to get as much credit for their efforts as possible. Givers, on the contrary, act in the general interest, helping others and providing mentoring. They share time, ideas, skills, and connections, in a true team spirit. Matchers place themselves between the opposite ends of the behavioral spectrum: they are the ones who will pursue fairness, taking as much as they give. The lines between these three reciprocity styles are not always well defined, but it's safe to say that in the course of our careers we all develop a primary approach. Experience teaches us that altruism and affability on the workplace aren't regarded as indicators of talent and strength, they rather overshadow Givers' true potential, compromising their own success, and letting dominant behaviors advance for job promotions and higher paychecks. But is it always the case?<br /><br />With the support of a plethora of emblematic examples, anecdotes, and theoretical thinking rooted in organizational psychology (the study of human behavior within an organization, group, or class), Grant goes on demonstrating why and how takers are not necessarily the strongest and most successful performers, and how, in our digital era and deeply interconnected world, those who strive to help others have the potential to become incredibly successful achievers, a rare breed of people capable of creating value for themselves while maximizing opportunities for the benefit of a group, team, community. 'Giving' is professionally risky, but when it is motivated by a genuine interest and structured in a creative and intelligent form (using persuasion, networking, motivation, negotiation, communication), the positive effects of such a business ethic cascade and spread, generating, in its wake, consensus and emulation.<br /><br />Unlike many business manuals, and despite the impressive preparation of this author in matter of business psychology, Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success doesn't suffer the drawbacks of academic formality. Grant's writing, although always elaborated and robust, is eloquent without being tedious, informative without being overwhelming. His bold reasoning is ultimately inspiring and uplifting, if not always realistic.<br /><br />Extended review available on Mina's Bookshelfing, if not always realistic.<br /><br />Extended review available on Mina's Bookshelf
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This set is compact for easy storage and contains the entire film series. A good collection to have and nice to not have it dominating the shelf. About the size of a complete TV season on DVD would be. Came with a bonus poster/picture book of the first movie
B0079J28NW|5.0|This movie is a great cartoon classic. It will really remind you of the 70's and the Beatles. If you are younger, you will still enjoy this movie showing good vs. evil.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|This is seriously the best show I have ever seen. It has great plots and wonderful and well developed characters. I highly recommend it!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I know the contents of the story is hard to fathom but<br />the characters are so rich and alive. The stories are always<br />so very good. The actors are marvelous. I can never figure out<br />what's going to happen next.
B003JHKORK|5.0|My six year old and I have been reading this series and we finished the Lightening thief and he got the movie as a reward.  It is great.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|Very nice app.  I like the color-coding capability, I've assigned one color to each family member and it let's me see quickly just who is having an appointment or sporting event that day.  To be honest, I got this hoping to use as a work-around outlook and eventually sync outlook to google, then sync google to this.  Well, it does sync.  But...even when I tried just synching  google calendar to this all I could see was an event that said &#34;Busy&#34; and the time frame.  No details whatsoever on the what the event was.  So am still working on learning how this app works...will update this review when/if I figure things out.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|One of the best books I've read recently.  It's written by a Navy Seal, so don't expect it to be flawlessly written. But, he manages to make you feel like you are there in the mud with him. This fact is all the more amazing because it is true.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|It is a brand new OEM. Love this Bluray... Anybody who loves Celline's songs...Must see. NO regrets  guarantee it. Enjoy it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really liked this show, very well done and great story line.  I hope they continue making new seasons.  I love that I can watch on my iPad.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Absolutely love it. Perfect every day watch. Looks great with a NATO strap instead of the cheap nylon strap it comes with. Highly recommend
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|I want to read this book next with my son.  I has a great message, that kids can be powerful in their own right.
0060512806|5.0|Do you like cryptography? do you like WW2 spy thrillers that has the spy by an large acting like intelligence agents act (desk job)?  Do you like books where computers are actually used as they're used?  Do you like perl code as plot point?<br /><br />Bruce Schneier wrote the crpto for the book.  'nuff said.  buy it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put this down! Finished the whole series in a week! Well developed characters. Interesting plot. Suzanna Collins, I am a fan!
0984380213|5.0|I am starting a business and this book gave me a great overall of the sales process. This is a beginner book, so if you have experience on sales, move alone pal.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This does exactly what it needs to do and wakes me up every morning. It's intuitive and that's all there is to it.
140006922X|4.0|I think that the book is a fair summation of comparison of the gospels with the known history of the times. I find it unbiassed.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie was really funny.  I was not expecting it to be laugh out loud funny, but it was in places.  It is good to watch a movie, especially from this genre, that doesn't take itself too seriously.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|My new favorite band! Great Southern Rock n Roll. Charlie Star is one of the best guitarists I have heard in a while and he has a great voice. This band's live performance will blow you away.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Not the best movie I've seen all year, but it's entertaining and fun for a night when you want to stay in with dinner and movie. Love the costumes and the modern music is awesome.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|While my game is still in progress I give this game two stars because it freezes up quite often and I will have to exit the game to get work again. It makes it a frustrating game.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game it is very addictive.  I like playing in all the different rooms, and all the different voices they try to match to the rooms.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an amazing book ever. A good young love book with an amazing moral and theme about a kid fighting cancer very sweet and touching.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I have never read the book so I don't know how true it is to that but it was missing something, but I don't exactly know what.  The acting was great, the script seemed pretty good, but it was still missing a beat somewhere.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|I stumbled onto the first book in this series with some trepidation. Another vampire book. *sigh* What I loved about this book is that it was interesting and well thought out and believable. These vampyres that the Casts have created are not stereotypical, but they aren't far off what people would originally think of when they think vampire. It's current and intriguing, and a great read for any young adult.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|Well written and full of suspense. Gives a great picture of the position of the French Resistance and the time of the impending D-Day landings.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I LOVE this app!  The colors are bright and pretty, the levels go from super easy to challenging.  I would, however, rather earn hints by completing levels successfully, or something like that.  I like the fact that it doesn't take very long to play a level.  Sometimes I don't have a lot of time, or I get interrupted.  This game is very easy to put down and pick up again.  It doesn't save partially completed levels, but that is not a real problem because it doesn't take much to play the level again.  I really, really like it!
B00459EZLW|5.0|Great story, nice pace, engaging, great acting... it is a huge fallacy this show is not on anymore.  Left me hanging.
B0045NXMJE|5.0|Funny quirky film<br />the disk was in great shape and I've watched<br />the movie several times over<br />I'd buy from this seller again
B004XVN1T4|3.0|Ken Follett maintains his usual style of storytelling but falls short in my expectation after reading his other masterpieces such as Winter of the World, etc.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great game! Wish there were more ways to get coins to play with. Would have given it 5 stars then! Fun anyway!
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|Just boring, seriously wait till it comes out on over the air TV as I doubt movie channels will waste the money on it
B00CATONCA|5.0|this thing is super cool. I pre-ordered it and it came in right on time. the collector case is really cool with the heads in the tank and the Blu-ray package fits in nice, maybe a little too tight. I cant wait to see what the next seasons special edition will be.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The idea of the Chromecast is as solid as the brick I threw at your sister in third grade. The execution is so poorly done that the Governor had to call in a reprieve. The problem is that when you cast (LIGHTNING BOLT) the &#34;app&#34; gives you almost no remote control capabilities other than play and pause. I am spoiled because using my PS3 to play videos on I can pause, play, fast forward, rewind, etc. Casting (FIREBALL) anything other than youtube videos is more heartache than anything. Also it gets confused and the app has no way to reset it so you have to physically unplug it and plug it back in so that it can cast (CHARM PERSON). If they fixed it so that the cast (MAGIC MISSILE) app gave your prtable device more controls I would be interested in it again. But atm it is just sitting in a drawer waiting to cast (CREEPING DOOM) once again.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|T=he mobile charger works perfect.  Delivering the optimal amps to both my Apple and Android devices, I ended up buying a second to replace non-Anker car charge plugin unit for my car.
B0019NG73G|5.0|One of the best movies on Gettysburg out there. I have watch it several times and never tire of watching it. Jeff Daniels and Tom Berringer should have gotten an award for their portrayal of Chamberlain and Longstreet. If you like historical movies, you need to put this in your collection.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|This movie had the action and humor of the original tv series with better graphics of course.  I enjoyed it.
1616551607|5.0|In a word: fantastic. This set is a priceless addition to any collector's mass of artbooks or Final Fantasy merchandise, and at just over $60, I practically stole the thing. Like other reviewers ecstatically related, this set doesn't really come in a slipcase; instead, it's packaged in a lovely and extremely sturdy case that's covered in a silky, decorated fabric which makes for a beautiful display piece in itself.<br />The three books included in the set are very well constructed and made of quality materials. Many of the illustrations inside, especially in the first volume, are conceptual fiend designs done in black-and-white ink, and I actually think that these are some of the most breathtaking in the whole set.<br />Book 2 is easily the largest, and there is a good amount of FFIV artwork in this publication (which I was most excited to see!), but it's dominated by FFVI works, which comprise about half of the volume.<br />The final artbook isn't as colorful or varied in terms of technique as the others, and a number of the portrayed works are just magnifications or WIPs of other pieces shown, which is somewhat disappointing. It's like the publisher just ran out of stuff to add to the book, so it was done to fill up more pages. Also, there's a weird close-up of Kuja's crotch on one of the latter pages (you've been warned!). Additionally noteworthy is the fact that the final illustrations are peculiar marker drawings of moogles. Still, it was fun to see Amano's representations of later Final Fantasy protagonists and villains, and the third volume brought the set to a satisfying close nonetheless.<br />Basically, you can't go wrong with this purchase.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|The span between plays depends on your friends' response. If you are strong into fun and competition, Candy Crush Saga is better!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|You think that something great is going to happen at the end of the book it is a political statement. Although I thought a lot about my grandfather and all of the atrocities that he witnessed in WWII. Sometimes it's good to look for those happy endings.  Sometimes people get too caught up in life and its negativity. I want to always think that there will be a happy ending. Thats what keeps me going and clarifying to my self that it's &#34;real&#34;.
B009NNMB70|4.0|Even Martin Scorsese digs One Direction. In the most hilarious scene from One Direction: This Is Us, a 3D rockumentary about the world's biggest boy band, the director comes backstage to greet the lads before their debut at Madison Square Garden. \\"I like your stuff,\\" Scorsese says, shaking hands with all five U.K. crooners. Admittedly, Scorsese seems to be doing a tear-inducing favor for an accompanying girl (his granddaughter, perhaps), but he brings up a point that this film boldly illuminates: What's not to like? The quintet, made up of Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson, seems utterly unpretentious, with personalities as infectious as all those earworm-y singles. They harmonize wondrously on stage, singing tunes that are both energetic and respectful toward swarms of largely female fans, and off of it, they're each shown exuding appreciative glee, which, unlike the downtime in, say, Katy Perry: Part of Me, has nothing to do with preachy, puffed-up ideas about changing people's lives. That the movie is nearly as innocuous as the band's chart-toppers is bound to put a target on its back, goading cynics to dismiss it as frivolous bunk. But what makes the performers worth exploring is their truly anomalous nature.<br /><br />Having each auditioned independently on Britain's The X-Factor in 2010, the boys, who range in age from 19 to 21, were eventually cobbled together as a group, a move for which Simon Cowell proudly takes credit in the film (\\"I made the decision in about 10 minutes,\\" Cowell boasts, even though some sources claim the idea came from X-Factor guest judge Nicole Scherzinger). One Direction eventually lost the show's competition, but they signed with Cowell's Syco Records, and saw a rabid, rapidly formed fanbase rocket them to global fame before they'd even cut an album. Thanks in part to social media, the U.K. sensation soon hit the U.S., and in the movie, via an infographic that's typical for the film's director, Morgan Spurlock (who takes an uncharacteristic, low-profile approach to the job), we see the viral, worldwide spread on an animated map, which is soon covered with that ubiquitous \\"1D\\" logo. In the subsequent tour that This Is Us chronicles, the group bounces restlessly from France to Japan to Verona, each nation loaded with girls who all but convulse before the band in fits of joy. \\"It's not unusual; it's unprecedented,\\" notes a pundit, adding that not even the Beatles achieved this level of success so early in their careers.<br /><br />Harry, Zayn, Niall, Liam, and Louis may not be the new John, Paul, George, and Ringo, but they all have remarkable singing chops. Unofficial frontman Harry stands out thanks to his especially impish rebellious streak and an inborn cool that promises he'll never be settling down from this life (the singer evokes Keith Richards long before he cites him as a hero). However, the bandmates otherwise seem to be on mostly equal footing. There's no spotlight-hogging Justin Timberlake here, nor does there seem to be a merely competent Nick Lachey, whose future will involve hosting shows that seek out the world's next One Directions. During the movie's breathless performance segments, all five guys are deftly engaging the crowd and the cameras, while the stage's video backdrops are brought to life via visual effects. At one point, the rock-inspired group belts out a cover of Wheatus's \\"Teenage Dirtbag,\\" while they're each depicted as anything but the song's title, intermittently adopting the CG qualities of a comic-book-ish set, and appearing as the superheroes so many imagine them to be.<br /><br />But the boys genuinely don't seem to see themselves that way. Some of the film's most memorable moments involve Niall and Liam looking down on oceans of screaming devotees in the street, and controlling their cheers like orchestra conductors. It's not pomposity, as these kids are as shocked by the whopping spectacle as you are. And unlike Lindsay Lohan and Honey Boo Boo, the One Direction guys don't seem to have come from households with stage moms and dads. Their ostensibly blue-collar families are simply riding the wave with them, and the movie's poignancy comes from the bittersweet musings of the parents, who wrestle with empty-nest syndrome, the role-reversal of their children showing them the world, and the sheer surrealism of having a son achieve such monumental fame. Spurlock's chief mistake is that he seems to yank out confessional, kumbaya hogwash, underlining that which viewers can easily infer from the proceedings. The boys come off as being incapable of fakery, and their recreational antics more than speak for themselves, so the repeated insistence that they're \\"just normal guys\\" plays like a filmmaker's manipulative concession to genre clich&eacute;s. Most glaring is a scene that's wholly out of context, wherein the band mates pitch tents and build a campfire, just so they can sit around it and discuss the future for the cameras. It's unabashedly staged, but then again, it visually highlights what Spurlock didn't need to spell out for anyone: that this movie captures a red-hot act at the peak of their glory, like it's holding onto a flame.ohan and Honey Boo Boo, the One Direction guys don't seem to have come from households with stage moms and dads.

B0007LXPBI|5.0|I first saw this movie on TV and was enchanted.  Lohan was great.  Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson were the perfect parents.  I finally decided I had to have it.  I watch it every other week or so, it's just that entertaining.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|I have seen The Great Gatsby several times over the years and I have enjoyed it each and every time.
B00BI745AA|2.0|Fair acting....needs to stay in the theatre. The singing talent is very limited. But the costumes are great, the dirt looks real...but the performers were not chosen for their singing ability or stage presence!
1476712042|2.0|I finished the book to see what would happen in the end. This book is very unrealistic, in real life the bad boy wouldnt have sticked around & change his life a little for a girl.
B00DDZM0GQ|1.0|This could be a great game if some changes were made to it. When you get to the 20 something levels the game becomes impossible. The blocks start out so high up that a lot of times it goes straight to the &quot;game over&quot; screen, BEFORE you even make a move. And when it does give you a chance, you have to try and clear a row every turn (IMPOSSIBLE) to stay in the game.<br />To add to the frustration, it does not save your progress at every level. For example, it will save at level 24 and then again at 30...considering the extreme level of difficulty, it takes a LONG time to get through that many levels. I have only made it as far as level 28 before I either had other things to do or I just got fed up...So when I returned to the game I had to start all over at level 24 (and I'm still stuck there).<br />If these issues were fixed, this game would be really great...until then, it only deserves one star.
0345803485|1.0|The fact that the writer of this dreadful, less than mediocre piece of fiction has made millions makes sense only if you accept the idea that we are now living in the age of illiteracy.  Line by line the text in this novel could be lifted directly from anybody's text message minus acronyms.  The pity of the sorry state of literature at this time is that writers who create magic with their prose and embed powerful philosophical concepts in beautifully refined and complex language are unpublished or ignored.  People used to read elegant prose even when it was put to the service of selling watches in a Sears Catalog.  Read the letters of common soldiers writing home during the Civil War.  These were people who were used to reading sophisticated prose and could summon the ability to produce it when they needed to express to their loved ones and the world the overwhelming emotion they experienced in their terrible situation.  50 Shades of Grey is what has happened to American English expression.  I despair and wonder how we can ever make our way back to the heritage we all have been gifted by Shakespeare and the great writers who have taken our language and readers to aesthetic realms where true creative fiction belongs.

B004LQEYAG|5.0|I was very pleased by this product. It is a DVD I have wanted to own for many years and now I do.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|This is just a blah movie. Nice frills in places but overall, meh. Acting is not anything to brag about....costumes are ok. Screen shots are ok, but again, nothing of note.
B009NY43NY|3.0|This book was just way too neatly tied up. It just really wasn't nearly as good as I had come to expect in this series. The tone of the book was 'hurry up and finish'. Still, had the makers of the show stuck to the story line in the books, that show would be much better. So even though this book wasn't all I expected, it was still worth reading.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I work in a law firm and even though this show is sooooo far from the real workings, it is such a fun show to watch!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|It is a great show with a nicely structured script and fabulous acting. You get to know the town and its residents, the stories behind everyone.
B000WC3864|5.0|Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell both shock and entertain and the story behind the movie is almost better than the movie itself - this is a treasure every Evil Dead fan should have...

B00003CXCT|4.0|I am a long standing fan, and I really wish they gave you an option to buy this set without it being digitally remastered.  The updated graphics, and additional scenes are just not the same as the original.
B00E1L9N8E|2.0|This is supposed to be an HD movie right?  The quality is horrible! I was so excited to see this movie but the poor quality ruined it for me.  Especially since I spent $15 to buy the digital version. I really wish that I had waited for the blue ray.  Don't waste your money on this one.
B003BV8I3Q|5.0|This is the movie that Denzel Washington as well as Spike Lee should have won an Oscar for. The acting is superb, and the story line provided much information into the life of Malcolm X. I really like this movie, and have since the first time that I saw it. The Oscar nominating committee really blew it for not giving Denzel Washington an Oscar for his portrayal of Malcolm X. Shame!
B000088E6D|2.0|songs weren't as great as i thought they would be i would not recommend this cd to anyone was not worth it
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|This movie is a poor shadow of the original with Sylvester Stallone. There is little to no plot and the action is good but to almost no point.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game not a waste of time. Play the game! Has awesome graphics cool upgrades, and cool new worlds. You won't be sorry, I promise. No kidding, for real please get it now.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed seasons one and two and were excited to see the third season.  I would recommend this series to anyone.
B00B3EJ292|2.0|I really cannot rate this movie.  When I tried to stream it was subtitled and I could not read on my TV, so I turned it off.  I guess I need to maybe change some settings on my TV so I can read the bottom of the screens when streaming from Amazon prime.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|An interesting way to spend a few minutes a day, when I can tear myseld away!  I recomment this game to anyone who enjoys mazes and/or problem solving games.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This is the worst game ever sometimes it won't open. I do not recommend this it is very bad, do not get it, you will pay your battery for it.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|I wanted to see this movie in the theater but the prices were to high. I was very pleased to see amazon offering it for $5.00! (What a great value!)  This movie is great, could not ask for a better pairing between Dicaprio and Mcquire.  The story is a classic American Novel, and the movie &#34;does the book justice&#34; which is fairly rare in my opinion with most movies based on books. I have tried watching the original movie several times but never made in past the intro because it is slow and seems to drag on endlessly. This is not the case with this version, action, adventure and love abound in this version of the movie.<br /><br />Bottom line, Its absolutely worth the $5.00 rental fee, its absolutely worth the purchasing fee but I will tell you if you are on the fence at all spend the $5.00 and enjoy a great ride to a different time in American History.
0062255657|5.0|A lovely, introspective, adventurous story - shown from the eyes of a man, when he is both child and adult.

B0009P42S2|5.0|Steam punk, Japanese style! Every convention concerning steam punk culture is used in this wonderful Japanese movie, that also features an English language translation. The characters are well developed and the battles at the end are very similar to those in the more famous masterpiece &#34;Akira&#34;. Beautifully made movie and if you don't get the fantastic and VERY funny use of names and other social references (the  spoiled rich girl being named Ms. Scarlett O'Hara) then go out and see more movies, or better, buy more from reviews here...
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this is a really great game! It easily could be a full length PC game. from the story line to the graphics and puzzles this game has given equal pride to each of these item.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Remember the last episode of &#34;The Sopranos&#34;? Left you waiting for the real ending? Just so with this book. I couldn't believe it when I clicked my Kindle for the next page at what turned out to be the last page and there wasn't one. I think this author was paid by the word. What a disappointment.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Fun til last few levels, then becomes tedious with so many pieces falling on blocked wall. Not enough extras even avoiding use in earlier levels.
0761172726|5.0|This is about the 10th year I have gotten this calendar.  Great for keeping 5 people's schedules recorded!!  Also love that it is from August 2103 thru December 2014,
B000000H6Y|5.0|Peter Steele never took the genre seriously and that was what made his music so much fun. On the surface, it was all dark and heavy and &#34;Oh SO DARK&#34;, but in reality, he just made light of the whole Goth thing AND made some very listenable music. &#34;Christian Woman&#34;, when first heard, is about as heavy as it can be, very wicked and sacrilegious, but when he starts on how &#34;Jesus looks like me&#34;, it turns into a boy wants girl story and that he'd use her weakness for guys with long hair and beards to get to her. But it's all a joke, all that he did was just to make us REALLY look at our language and how we interpret things around us.  I have to tell you to seek out his version of Neil Young's &#34;Cinnamon Girl&#34; and Seals and Crofts &#34;Summer Breeze.. He turns them into his own. But start with this one. Steele passed away in 2010 from to heart failure at the age of 48, after pulling a hoax about dying in 2005. This one represents the groups first album to go platinum.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|I know this movie is getting a ton of negative reviews, so let me just say this.<br /><br />My 8, 6, 4 and 2 year old absolutely loved it.<br /><br />A.K.A, 5 stars. Win!
0762439009|3.0|I purchased this mostly for the mug and the rug to tie my office together.  They are awesome and I'm currently finishing my coffee out of the mug.<br /><br />MY BIG COMPLAINT IS:<br />When I opened the box the magnet and shirt patch were missing.  I looked through everything, I even found a toe with nail polish, but no magnet or shirt patch.  I would send it back, in hopes that I get the kit as described, but I live in Nome Alaska and well it'd take too much time and energy to mail it back.  After all the Dude is a lazy man.<br /><br />If all the items would have all been there it would have been 5 stars.<br /><br />&#34;The Dude Abides&#34;
B001D0DQUC|5.0|One of my favorite John Hughes movies.  Quirky and fun movie that should be introduced to a whole new generation.
B002I8PVQA|5.0|I have seen the movie previously however my girlfriend never saw it, been trying to find it for a while and once i saw it was available for streaming i jumped at the chance.<br /><br />The video quality was great, the movie did stop a few times to catch up but other than ha it was good.
B00014X8KO|5.0|Though fully in Japanese, the dubbing is excellent, the animation is outstanding, the stories are so well thought out...even the previews of other attractions from the publisher are great. Buy this one, you will not be disappointed.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is one time I wished I had the book in my hand,not just on the kindle.This is a fascinating book with almost 25 percent of it in the notes and bibliography. I was really impressed with the history surrounding Jesus. Gave me a whole new perspective.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and have really enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2.  Great Insights into the turbulence of society changing from one based upon nobility to merit based success.  Show contains multiple people with strong values that I can identify with -- values that guide them through difficult circumstances.<br /><br />Also has people with contrasting less then sterling value sets -- the consequences are apparent.<br /><br />Story lines are very interesting!  Well worth viewing.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love the game and I love playing it. But it would of been 20% cooler if I wouldn't of had to start over because of the last update. That's why I'm only giving it a 4 out of 5.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|For $9.99, this is a rock-solid adapter that allows you to use any old-style MagSafe power adapter (from the original MagSafe MacBook Pro adapter to the 2011 MacBook Air/Pro adapters) with newer MacBooks (which have a thinner connector).<br /><br />It's a bit of a necessary evil, since the power adapter had to slim down to fit more easily with Apple's ever-thinner laptops. But it works well and doesn't feel like it will ever break.<br /><br />The one gripe I have is that, if you need to use it only sometimes (say, you have an older MacBook and a newer one, and you switch between the two), it's a little clumsy to pop the adapter on and off (it almost always requires two hands). Plus, it's so small it could easily get lost if you don't keep it attached to the power cable.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This show keeps you on the edge of your seat every episode.  I can't wait for more seasons to come to Prime.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Fringe is quirky and I enjoy the adrenaline rush I get watching the show. Can't wait to watch the rest of the series.
B00CL8D83U|4.0|After pet shop boys &#34;Elysium&#34; I find this to be a very second rate attempt, perhaps the boys are trying to pump out as much as possible before they finally stop producing work together. I felt that after quite a few mediocre albums (still good though), the pair hit the sweet spot with Elysium, I think the best CD they've done in years.This album, however, leaves me flat, something a PSB cd should not do.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Spoilers obviously:<br /><br />I think the whole \\"marry the best friend, not your love interest\\" thing is contrived and lame. Certain deaths were lame but made sense, but I kept wishing haymitch would actually have a real role
B00ECUARO8|4.0|If you like spare but meaningful stories like To Kill A Mockingbird, you'll probably like Mud. Matthew McConaughey turns in an excellent performance as a man on the run, as do the two young actors who help him make his escape. The story is set in Mississippi, and conjures up the rural South in a way few movies do. This is an original movie that is well worth seeing.
0064400557|5.0|I as many others, grew up with the animated cartoon version of Charlotte's Web. Personally, I had a love/hate for it. I'd watch the movie until the last five minutes when Charlotte dies (ejecting the VHS tape... throwback for you guys). As a child I loved Charlotte, and thought it was a joke that you're supposed to not feel so bad after she dies because her children are born... and then leave Wilbur.<br /><br />No more about my early 90s childhood memories, yes? What I was trying to say was that I grew up with Charlotte's Web, but never read the book, until three years ago when I was 22. I was expecting to have the same feelings I did as a child and apparently... I was wrong...ish.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of reading/listening to the audio book of Charlotte's Web which was read by the author, E.B. White. That was pretty amazing in itself. If you can get a hold of a copy I highly suggest that you listen to that version of the audio book.<br /><br />Usually, I am not one to look for metaphors, themes, etc in books. In fact I usually detest them (thanks English class). But this book had themes screaming from it.<br /><br />- 'Life, the universe and everything... 42 (HHGTTG)'. When Wilbur was moved to Fern's uncle's barn, Fern visited him occasionally. On a day when she did not visit, Wilbur wondered why he should be alive, and what was the meaning of life and the poignant fact that he's only two months old, so if he was this depressed at two months then what's the point of living? That's huge. It's a kids book and that's so deep. Especially when I felt that White's not trying to hide Wilbur's depression and thoughts at all.<br /><br />- 'Wizard's First Rule: People are stupid (Sword of Truth/Legend of the Seeker)'. Charlotte did not view humans as... smart. She repeatedly said they are gullible, stupid, etc. It was on this point that she gets the idea to spin the words in her webs about Wilbur. All of the humans blatantly ignore that spider spun words into a web. All of the humans looked past that and believed the miracle to be what the words said, 'Some Pig', meaning Wilbur, therefore Wilbur was a miracle. Only one character brings up the point about the words being a miracle, but she is dismissed. And of course this happens two more times and hundreds of people see the words in the web and all believe that the pig is the miracle and not the spider. If this isn't a view of society (well the human mind), than I don't know what is.<br /><br />- 'Growing Up (Now I feel bad that I didn't get a phrase from a book for this one)'. This one was focused on Fern. Throughout the novel, her mother was worried about Fern's mental stability since she spent all of her days in the barn, claiming the animals could talk, and not with boys or playing with other children. Fern's mother, Mrs. Arable, even went as far as to consult with a therapist about Fern, who said not to worry. Of course, when the first of two days of the Fair comes, Fern took a ride with a boy named Henry Fussy on the ferries wheel. That day, the first day, she divided her attention between Wilbur and Henry equally. The second day of the Fair however, the day that Wilbur won his prize, Fern was only concerned on one thing: Henry Fussy. She literally did not care about her family's excitement that Wilbur had been called up to receive a medal. She was begging her mother for money to ride the Ferris wheel with Henry Fussy again (by the way, he was always referred to as 'Henry Fussy' not just 'Henry'). The aftermath of the fair, Fern spent less and less time at the barn, thinking of it as childish and more time thinking of her time on the Ferris wheel with Henry Fussy (her brother made fun of her since the summer had long past). It bugged me a little, because Fern was only eight years old in this novel. She's not old enough to think 'oh this is too childish, I need to think about boys'. I don't know, maybe because it also infuriated me that she just dropped Wilbur so fast, when in the start of the novel she'd do anything for him. And all because of Henry Fussy. (Dear E.B. White, What kind of a last name for a character let alone a small boy, was 'Fussy'? Sincerely, Me).<br /><br />In the 70s cartoon, I thought just about every character was annoying. I hated Wilbur because he whined too much and cried all the time. I hated Templeton because he was the bad guy. Didn't really like the humans or the animals either because they were berks. The only thing I liked was Charlotte and they killed her. So... imagine my surprise with the novel. I didn't really have a problem with any of the characters in this novel. The only one that bugged me was Fern's older brother, Avery, but even he kind of redeemed himself when Wilbur received his prize at the Fair and he was present and serious for a change (unlike Fern, for once she was absent and immature). I think it's rare that a book (or anything really) has every single character be likeable.<br /><br />(By the way, apparently, E.B. White hated the 1970s cartoon of Charlotte's Web.)<br /><br />I honestly found this book very enjoyable.n in the start of the novel she'd do anything for him. And all because of Henry Fussy.

B00AYB1RGG|5.0|The original was campy as hell. Fortunately I love campy. The remake made good use of more modern special effects. The plot was pretty dark but you're not interested in this movie because you feel the need for warm fuzzies and unicorn kisses.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|This game is really easy, but also has just enough challenge to it to keep you interested. I love watching how the characters are going to land, how the ball is going to go, and the surprises when it hits an explosive and blows up a couple of &quot;bad guys&quot;. There are built in hints, a few extra challenges, and I love how you can play the<br />level until you get it right. The credits are pretty clever too. The game is goofy, clever, silly, addicting, and both simple and easy.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|We enjoyed every minute of the series.  The last episode in season 2 was particularly enjoyable.  These are a must watch!
B009PNQUXO|5.0|This is the only app that let me download videos directly to my phone after loooong ! Now thats something!
B00C28J2VQ|1.0|I bought  G.I. Joe: Retaliation (Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy +UltraViolet)  the last month & and I'm very disappointed in the recording of the movie, as we were watching the movie, the whole family, when for a few seconds the image is in black and leaves a scene of pornography, generating much indigancion everyone, for that buying by Amazon we thought that everything was original and the truth we did not expect this nasty surprise.<br /><br />Therefore we expect an apology and product change, but the truth should sue them for this. Who knows how many products will have more so for this style.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Better than iPad version. A lot of graphics and weather info in simple format easy to follow.  It does the job!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I wouldn't regret my purchase of this battery manger at all, and must say that I have noticed many of the negative comments, the reviewer would simply call it their kindle, and the positive reviews so far were from kindle fire hd owners. Great application for how I like to use my kindle.
