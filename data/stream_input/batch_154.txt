0380788624|5.0|As this book is largely set in the Philippines, Stephenson naturally  provided some insights into the Filipino people, culture, and country. <br />I won't add to the voluminous praises on Cryptonomicon -- plot, knowledge of subject matter etc. Just one point not much mentioned; Stephenson's accuracy and insight into the Philippines.<br />Straight from a Pinoy, the author did a remarkable effort in describing the country and the socio-cultural nuances. Sharp as a blade funny (with the rapier thrust of Stepehenson's wit) and many times a telling, awkward, introspective, and heartwarming reminder of what we, Filipinos, are as a people.<br />For that alone, it is worth a read.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I was very angry when I found out it was not a Best Picture contender....and what abiut Jamie Bell, best actor? Come on, he blew russell Crowe away! And Gary Lewis for Supporting Actor, or Dafoe.....Benicio del Toro was not that good! Along with CROUCHING TIGER,HIDDEN DRAGON and ALMOST FAMOUS, this wass the best movie of the year~
B00000HYXB|5.0|I bought this CD because I had heard it was inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's work.  The title NIGHTFALL IN MIDDLE EARTH also suggested something to do with Tolkien.  As it turns out, this CD is based on The Silmarillioni and is dedicated to Tolkien.<br />I am not a heavy metal fan.  I own only a few heavy metal CDs.  My main background is classical and Renaissance-style music.  I wasn't sure what to expect. This CD grabs you from the opening intro with swords clashing and soldiers crying out and carries you all the way to the final conclusion of darkness decending on Middle Earth.  I was blown away!<br />The most notable songs in my opinion are &quot;Into the Storm&quot; with the memorable cry of the troops &quot;...we are following the will of the One...&quot;  &quot;Nightfall&quot; sounds almost as if it could have been written during the Renaissance era, except for the electric guitars.  The two most epic songs on the disc are &quot;The Curse of Faenor&quot; and &quot;A Dark Passage.&quot;  We hear the anguish in Faenor's voice as he realizes his land's demise.  But he gives comfort to his people and a warning to Morgoth.  &quot;Don't fear the eyes of the Dark Lord. Morgoth! I cried.  I will take part in your damned fate!&quot;  But, the Dark Lord's victory is realized and we can feel his wrath in &quot;A Dark Passage,&quot; with his stirring commands.  &quot;Smash down the light.  I will not rest till I'm King!&quot;<br />Every time I listen to this CD I keep finding new and fascinating details that I missed the previous times.  This CD has really inspired me to re-read The Silmarillion and enjoy the epic wonder that this CD superbly portrays.
0553573403|5.0|First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different  fantasy authors in my time (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5  years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and  cliched.<br />  So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual:  Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and  man, that was the kicker!<br />  Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to  choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who  won't like this series:<br />  WHY TO READ GRRM<br />  (1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats  the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and  all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the  good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the  commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different  . . . you get the idea.  After reading this over and over, it gets old.<br />  (2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE  EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this  gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person  comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him  back.<br />  This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die,  but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the  adventure and perished.<br />  (3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was  influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED  YEARS WAR.<br />  (4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID  OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in  the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the  villain, is stupid or not too bright.<br />  (5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND  DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up where each chapter has  the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint.  Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if  you pay attention, someone else will mention a different angle of truth in  the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most importantly,  GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He  purposelly leaves it vague so that we are kept guessing.<br />  (6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are  long gone or dead. We never get the entire story but only bits and pieces;  something that other fantasy authors could learn from to heighten  suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we  sometimes get different opinions.<br />  (7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is  your guy. Almost flawless flow.<br />  (8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between  characters through threats and intrigue.<br />  (9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each  character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story  continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why  each novel is between 700-900 pages.<br />  (10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical  archetypes that we are used to in most fantasy; some are gritty; few are  totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of  characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book  three.<br />  (11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we  can't understand it but well done.<br />  (12) HEAPS OF SYMOBLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on  that.<br />  (13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits;  GRRM must have read a lot of mystery novels.<br />  (14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male  author on female characters I have read; realistic on how women think,  too.<br />  (15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so  heroes can't get out of jams with it.<br />REASON TO NOT READ GRRM<br />  (1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good  job of creating more likeable characters after a few die. But, if that isn't  your style, you shouldn't be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so  be warned.<br />  (2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like  more white and gray characters, this may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or  Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story with  strong archetypes.<br />  (3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer  that the POVS only go to a few characters, this might be confusing for  you.<br />  (4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in  real life.<br />  (5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK:  this isn't the case for all stories in the series. Some are still going on; some  have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on.<br />  (6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can  be done to some extent but not as much. This is b/c he doesn't try to  make anyone necessarily good or evil.<br />  (7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's  comfortable; we like the good young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE  RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to pretend we're  this upcoming, great hero. You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the  exception of one or two characters.<br />  (8) LENGTH: you don't want to get into a long fantasy epic series. In that  case, look for shorters works as this is biiig.<br />  (9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of  power (one female exception). ....we                                 sometimes get different opinions.<br />                                (7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is                                 your guy. Almost flawless flow.<br />                                (8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between                                 characters through threats and intrigue.<br />                                (9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each                                 character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story                                 continues and everyone gets scattered.

0451196716|4.0|Writing under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, Stephen King released a collection of novellas some twenty years ago. The Long Walk, which did not receive the attention of The Running Man, translated onto the big screen, and Rage, which seems to have all but disappeared due to the tragic high-school shooting incidents of recent years, is one of them.<br />The Long Walk consists of a group of 100 applicants, chosen each year at random from all of the submissions, to participate in a 'Long Walk'.  The prize? Everything and anything you want for the rest of your life. The defeat? 'Buying your ticket' out of the walk means ending your life....as you are shot by accompanying soldiers, always mindful of your pace, as you cannot fall under four miles per hour, and always watchful for 'runners' who try to escape the walk as they wear out. The walkers are not allowed to stop, for anything, or they are issued warnings. After three strikes, you are out, permanently.   King delves into the minds of several of the walkers, the largest treatise being given to Ray Garrity, the book's central character. Friendships are formed, enemies are made, and battle lines are drawn as each of the boys on the walk eyes the prize waiting at an undetermined distance ahead of them. The only way to win the prize, is to outwalk, and therefore outlive, everyone else.<br />As in most King novels, the descriptions of sights and people in the State of Maine is entertaining, especially to a native, and his exploration of the human mind is continually captivating. One of the things I have most enjoyed about King's works is his honesty of thought with characters in jeopardy or pain. Although at times his words are bitter and hateful, somehow King always manages to deliver what 'real' people think in times of crisis. The boys actually wishing each other dead, though horrible to think about, reads as utter realism from anyone competing with others for their life.  How many times have you, the average person, competed against another person, and found yourself entertaining thoughts that you would never dare to put a voice to?  King goes that far, and as always, his brutal words paint his characters all the more realistic.<br />Although I don't rate this as the best King book I have ever read, it ranks with my favorites, Bag of Bones, Misery, and Rose Madder. Stephen King seems to write best, and most convincingly, when he walks away from horror, the genre that has made him the best selling author of his time.  His best 'demons' are the ones that lay within us all, in our own minds. Without the advent of major plot twists and turns, and a limited 'landscape' for the book, as the boys are continually on the road, and there is no shift to exotic locations, or dream states, or other worlds, this book does manage to hold attention to the last.
B000001ELL|4.0|this album wasnt bad couldve been better but considering the last kiss album in the 1970s with the make up on their faces the album closed off a decade that kiss ruled along with the stones and aerosmith .
B000001FN3|5.0|Having got the vinyl version 20 years ago, I wasn't prepared to hear the modified version (voice-over) intro in the cd format. Modifications aside, this album is one of the greatest concept albums of all times - along with Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; which, incidentally, was engineered by Alan Parsons himself. Equally good in experiencing the true beauty and genius a good dose of progressive and intelligent rock can do for your soul is listening to &quot;Angel Station&quot; by Manfred Mann's Earth Band. That should complete your journey.
B0000039QA|5.0|This album was a classic, biggie showed that he is the best of the best.  From his storytelling, party joints, thugged-out joints, to his tribute songs.  Biggie is a man who perfected many styles, like no other rapper has ever done before.  All wana be mc's should take notes.
630575067X|2.0|The next two episodes which complete the Star Wars saga will have to be a huge improvement on this installment, if only to save the great name of Star Wars. From the word 'go' the potentially likeable team of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are battling against the forces of the dark side, the robots of the trade federation, and a decidedly dodgy script. The cheesy performance of the young Anakin Skywalker certainly doesn't help matters, and the sound and visual effects just don't seem to have the same positive influence on the film as the originals did. What did help the film's cause were the superbly convincing performance of young Natalie Portman, the Queen of Naboo, and the interesting and exciting character of Darth Maul, the original villain. However, as all of these new ideas, characters and plots enter the fray. e.g The trade federation, Naboo, the Sith and blood tests to check how strong you are with the force. You could be left asking yourself &quot;What has this got to do with the Star Wars story?&quot; You could quite easily walk out of the theatre wondering what it was all about!
B000002TP7|5.0|Killer album with great jazz samples!  Probably one of my favorites just because of the samples and beats, and it stays away from the sillier and cheesy elements of their earlier albums.
6300183211|5.0|Al Pacino's hypnotic portrayal of Cuban refugee-turned Miami druglord I think could be what lands him in the hall of fame with the greatest movie stars of all time. Single handedly, he turned a very simple, predictable, sometimes disappointing plot into a landmark of the crime drama genre. Having criticised the plot, it is enough to keep you interested, but it's the acting that will blow you away. The amazing Pacino aside, I was particularly impressed by the performances of the two mob bosses that Tony Montana (Pacino) is brought into the business by: Robert Loggia is superb as Frank Lopez, the veteran Miami bigshot that Tony ends up assassinating; and the equally impressive man who plays Sosa, the South American based drug producer who sends a 50 man hit-squad to Montana's mansion to finish him off. That ending sequence through the emotional demise of Montana's sister, Gina, to the wild machine gun brawl is the most memorable part of the film, other than Pacino of course.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The movie was good, but the soundtrack is great!  This is a collection of soulful hymns, bluegrass twang, old school blues, and real southern country, and I DON'T mean that Garth Brooks garbage.  If you're a fan of good music and like to have your tastes expanded, get this!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|The first time saw the preview for this movie I knew I had to get the Cd.  And I wasnted dissapointed, I watched the making of the movie on HBO, and I heard more of the music and I was impressed.  All the songs are great, who would have thought Nicole Kidman or Ewan McGregor could sing.  Awesome go get it its great you wont be dissapointed.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. My wife has wanted to see it for some time and I finally relented.Hell I wanted to see Charlie's Angels.       But I have to say that I was amazed at how good it was. I thought while watching it that it had a similar idea to Good Will Hunting. A movie that I only thought was ok and very over-rated. Maybe it just didn't connect with me like Finding Forrester did.      I thought the story was very clever, and above all the acting was incredible. The only one in the whole film who I thought was lacking was the love interest. Everyone keeps telling me how great she is because of The Piano. But her acting to me is dull, flat and utterly without emotion.      The film is a wonderful mix of drama, laughs and the human heart. An enchanting film all round. Well worth a watch.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor will really amaze you with their voices.  This is a great soundtrack, can't wait to see the movie.  &quot;elephant love song&quot; is so CHEESY it is an instant classic.  Don't let the Lady Marmalade song fool you, if you are a lover of broadway music this cd is for you.  Best tracks,  &quot;Children Of The Revolution&quot; &quot;Because We Can&quot; &quot;Sparkling Diamond&quot; &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot; &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot; &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; &quot;Come What May&quot;<br />&quot;You Song&quot; This is definately the best soundtrack in recent memory.  If the movie is half as good it will be a classic.
B000003TAW|5.0|I bought this CD because my friend said Weezer were good, and she was right! This CD is incerdibly wickedly awesome! Weezer have a sound no-one else can match.  Its a different sound that only Weezer can make up.  There unique, trendy style is cool! I love Weezer! I would suggest this CD to anyone who wants some good punk music.  Yeah, well radio stations love the songs, &quot;Buddy Holly, The Sweater Song&quot; but this is still a good CD, and those songs still kick!!!
B0000069KS|2.0|After watching this movie I am now convinced...Ringo Starr is an absolutely terrible actor.  His bad acting ruined this movie for me.  In the original version of Help, Mr. Starr had a cow in his room so he could drink warm milk.  I'm glad they edited out that scene because it was not even remotely funny.<br />Apart from Mr. Starr's acting, George Harrison delivers a tremendous performance.  I think it's hilarious when George Harrison is skiing with a top hat on his head.<br />Also, the title track is superb.<br />If the producers can edit out all of the scenes with Ringo Starr, this will by a 5-star movie.
B00004U2HK|5.0|I have been surfing this site for a long while now and come to a very sorry conclusion. People care nothing for the great classic videos, including The Sound of Music. Instead, they prefer to gaze mindlessly at today's quite pathetic &quot;movies&quot;, when they are merely a collection of talentless, fony actors and meaningless scripts and plots. <br />Why not take a look at the real world? Why not take a glance at a movie with an actual point, a movie based on life and reality? Your probably thinking, &quot;Wow, this movie is probably some boring musical -- a true waste of time.&quot; It is not! This is one of the greatest movies created and a definete must see for people of all ages and gender.<br />The Sound of Music is one of those truley great, entertaining movies that only come along once and a while. It takes place in the real world in a real life situation involving World War II. The actors are fresh and full of passion unlike the vastly over rated clowns on the big screen today. The music is well-known, too. Who hasn't heard of the &quot;Do, A Dear&quot; song?<br />Go see it today. I promise you, you won't regret it.
B00003CXRP|5.0|&quot;Cast Away&quot; is one of those all-too rare, brilliant films that is perfectly structured, perfectly conceived, and perfectly acted. In many ways, it is like a three act play, or three short movies. The first act introduces the main character and shows his life up until his being stranded on a desert island. The second act, the major bulk of the film, is a tour de force, one man character piece about the struggles to survive all by oneself.  To craft a film in which most of the action involves one actor by himself for around an hour or more of screen time, and make it absorbing, insightful, and never boring is an amazing achievement, one which can be attributed to the great direction of Robert Zemeckis and the wonderful performance by Tom Hanks, who manages to make his character both an everyman and three-dimensional, living, breathing person. It is in this second act that we really learn about this man. By seeing every creature comfort he has grown up with instantly snatched away from him, and watching a modern man have to utilize talents of survival he didn't even know he had, we the audience are rewarded with the experience of seeing a character closer than usually happens in film. The third act is the resolution: what happens when this man who has had to live a primitive lifestyle, returns to the modern world. The amazing thing is, not much has changed in terms of technology or so forth (therefore it is not a Rip Van Winkle type tale). Instead, he has changed. Watch this movie for one of the most fascinating character portrayals in recent film history,and for the great performance by Tom Hanks. Rarely does a movie so brilliantly set up a life for a character, take it away from him in a flash, thus forcing him to create a new life for himself, and then see the results when he is returned to the old one, forever now a changed man. Notice that the title is not &quot;Castaway,&quot; the noun, but the verb &quot;cast away,&quot; giving the movie much richer, symbolic levels of meaning than what the former would have been.
0783107986|4.0|This is by far one of the best overall summaries of WWII available.  Given an hour per subject, it effectively delves into the background of an issue as much as time allows without belaboring the details.<br />My only negative comment is that it should be kept in mind that this is given from a very British point of view.  The US, which bore the brunt of D-Day, both in materiel and casualties, was given scant coverage in comparison to its contribution.  It also lacks in-depth coverage of Asia-Pacific, which again was a predominantly US theatre of operation, with the exception of the British Burma Campaign, which was well documented.  An excpetion was the Iwo Jima program, which was excellent in that it represented in one episode what occurred repeatedly across the Pacific.  However, crucial battles such as Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, and the entire island hopping campaign, and their significance, were glossed over, if mentioned at all.  Again, these were battles which were US operations and were not given heavy coverage.  A better in-depth coverage of the Asia-Pacific Theatre, including the aftermath and Korea, can be found in &quot;Crusade in the Pacific&quot;, although you need to wade through some of the rhetoric and propaganda.  The World at War series could have used two to three more episodes; two covering the Asia-Pacific War, and one which included more on US operations and contribution in Europe.  This all strikes me as odd, as the Russian Front was given excellent coverage in this series, and they indeed bore the brunt of WWII in Europe, both as an army and as a nation.<br />I think the World at War series is still outstanding, and one of the best available.  Anyone interested in a great overview of WWII should definitely own it.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|For any fan of musicals, and pop music in general, this is an absolutely essential CD. It is the soundtrack for the new film, &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; which is the first post-modern musical. Although it takes place in Paris in the late 1800s, the brilliant concept of the film is to have the songs be pop hits, mostly from the 70s and 80s, and a few old standards and showtunes thrown in for good measure. But none of these songs are your regular, run-of-the-mill covers. These versions literally redefine the songs and revitalize them for the 21st century. None of the songs have ever sounded better, and in many cases they have been transferred into different musical genres than that from which they were first conceived. For example, Sting's &quot;Roxanne&quot; becomes a tango, and &quot;Your Song&quot; becomes an operatic aria. And the key word here is &quot;opera.&quot; These pop songs are all elevated to operatic standards, especially in the album's greatest track: &quot;Elephant Love Medley.&quot; Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, as lovers, sing to each other in an amazing and theatrical blending of many love songs well known in pop culture. And the brilliance does not end there. &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot; blends &quot;Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend&quot; with...what else?...Madonna's &quot;Material Girl&quot;! And the soundtrack also displays the characters of French prostitutes singing....Patti LaBelle's &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. In short, this is one of the most amazingly and perfectly well-crafted soundtrack albums I have ever heard, with a rich diversity of music and styles. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have startlingly beautiful singing voices...and yes, that's really them singing! If the movie, which I am now even more looking forward to seeing, is close to as good as this album, it might end up being one of my favorite movies of all time. My only complaint is that not all the songs from the movie are included on this album. I hope a second volumecomes out shortly, with &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; &quot;Sisters are doing it for themselves,&quot; &quot;I wanna dance with somebody,&quot; and a few other songs that are in the film.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|You can color me impressed by this CD.  Especially by the singing talents of both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.  Ewan is the star of this CD.  Watch him in Trainspotting then listen to this CD.  You will have a hard time believing that this is the same guy.  A very distinct, yet beautiful voice.  If you are up for an entertaining CD, you can't do much better than this one!  If you don't enjoy this at first listen, give it a second chance.  It will grow on you.  Especially the talents of one of the worlds finest actors, Ewan McGregor.
B00005BJ2O|1.0|christina aguilera's version of lady marmalade gets my vote for the worst song of 2001.  not only do we have to hear christina's annoying vocals, we are also blessed with hearing such talentless yahoo's as mya, lil kim and pink.  the rest of the cd is almost as bad as this song, but nothing could be as bad as anything christina aguilera has done.
B00005AXEL|4.0|I'm not bias, I tend to love the whole aura of Stevie Nicks and Fleetwood Mac. Her voice is as unique as her style. So I was eager for this release. The cd has not left my cd player since I purchased it last week. It is not just a cd for her fans, she is in rare form here, her best effort since &quot;Wild Heart&quot;. <br />Alot of credit goes to her collaborations, both with producers and other artists. However Nicks writing, and singing, are among her best. My favorite track is easily the powerful &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, a tale of drug dealers and users. However the country-pop of &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot;, the rocking &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot;, &quot;Candlebright&quot;, &quot;That Made Me Stronger&quot; and &quot;It's Only Love&quot; (in fact the whole first half) are excellent. Probably the weakest points are the bland &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;Bombay Sapphires&quot;.
0380788624|2.0|This book had all the ingredients of a great novel.  A set of plots woven together well and coming together nicely at the end, developed characters, and most of all some great info on the history of cryptology and World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters.<br /><br />The big disappointment was that after all that work weaving a great tale, Stephenson felt the need to insert absolutely pointless vulgarity at frequent random intervals.  It's as if he woke up on some days and said, \\"Hey, I'd like to have... spoken over and over in my novel, by Japanese, no less.\\"  He has a real fixation on gross topics more appropriate to rest room walls.  Perhaps he felt lacing his novel with profanity and gutter talk would somehow put him into the ranks of Wolfe and Clancy.  I just know that I was extremely sorry that I couldn't give the book to my young son to read--he could've learned a lot and enjoyed the experience.<br /><br />  A good story.  An the author is free to write as he pleases.  This is just a warning to readers.
0553471325|5.0|Dr. Lord loves Elinor, who loves Roderick, who loves Mary.  Aunt Laura Wellman loves them all.  They all appear to love Aunt Laura's money.  When Aunt Laura dies intestate, the question of who inherits seems simple indeed.  The characters occasionally appear shallow, but they can also display depth of character.  Elinor (who got Aunt Laura's estate) could be very likeable if she didn't hate Mary so.  Despite her hatred, Elinor honors Aunt Laura's dying wish and settles a tidy sum on Mary.  Mary behaves nobly throughout.  Roderick acts like a dunce throughout, but is capable of occasional sparks of nobility.  Dr. Lord stands on the sidelines and makes moon eyes at Elinor.  Is this a murder mystery or a soap opera?  Where is Hercule Poirot?  Doesn't the cover say this is a Poirot mystery?  That's the only reason I bought the radio play.  I'm at the end of tape one, and no Poirot in sight.<br />Mary dies and an autopsy reveals poisoning by morphine.  Aunt Laura is exhumed and found to have died from morphine poisoning also.  Elinor, who has motive and opportunity in spades for both deaths also appears to have the means.  Finally Dr. Lord shakes off his inactivity and calls in Hercule Poirot to save the woman he loves.<br />Poirot engages in the usual snooping and deduction, catches everyone lying, reveals all the dark secrets, and guides Elinor's barrister in the defense of the case.  He also figures out whodunnit.  At least he amasses enough evidence to . . . but I don't want to give away the story.  I'd hate to destroy your enjoyment when you figure it out for yourself.<br />When the time comes for Mary to die, you will have grown to like her so much that you will truly regret her killing.  You will also share Dr. Lord's forlorn faith in Elinor's innocence.  This novel has a much smaller cast of suspects than most Poirot novels, but the murderer's identity should remain opaque at least until the commencement of Elinor's trial.<br />The BBC radio play is very well done, as are all the BBC plays of Christie's Poirot stories, but the cover gives too great a hint as to the murderer's identity.  Luckily, I pay more attention to the writing on the back of a book cover than I do to the picture on the front.  I thus noticed the cover's significance only after I finished the play.ne, as are all the BBC plays of Christie's Poirot stories, but the cover gives too great a hint as to the murderer's identity.

B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park has become probably the best new-age heavy metal rock band to hit the market this year. From their impressive DJ mixing, to their guitar to their vocal cords, Linkin Park has put many genres in one, creating sounds more than one person may like. Their mix of heavy metal shouting to the rapping, it all comes together to create a perfect melody. Notice there was no &#8220;Parental Advisory&#8221; sticker on the CD case? Linkin Park&#8217;s lyrics are touching, and yet resemble your own thoughts, without including trash in them. With clean lyrics, everyone can enjoy the tunes without embarrassment nor having to turn down the radio. Here is a brief overview of the Platinum CD:<br />1 - Papercut: Excellent New-Age sounds, good melody, with the mix of Rap and Rock, the inspiring lyrics make you think to yourself. -=5.0=-<br />2 - One Step Closer: Linkin Park&#8217;s &#8220;hit&#8221; song, which was the main reason I bought the CD. After listening to the other tracks, One Step Closer became boring, but yet, it still has a good melody, and intertwine of Rock and Rap. -=4.0=-<br />3 - With You: Superb usage of  New-Age sounds,  very nice melody, and lyrics that leave you thinking to yourself, yet again. Another good mixture of both Rock and Rap. -=5.0=-<br />4 - Points of Authority: After listening to this song over and over, I still can&#8217;t get hooked to it. I&#8217;m not sure what it is about it, but it just doesn&#8217;t touch me like the others. -=2.5=-<br />5 - Crawling: Probably Linkin Park&#8217;s best song, with a VERY cool music video! Crawling expresses the feelings inside you that you can&#8217;t control, with an excellent melody. Yet again, impressive New-Age sounds make the song 10 times better. With the mixture of a light melody, then progressively harder melody, Crawling makes this song one that you would sit back in a chair and close your eyes to. -=5.0=-<br />6 - Runaway: The song never came to my attention until a month or so ago, after listening deeply to the lyrics. The rich tone of New-Age sounds, and the guitar make this song a hit of this CD. The lyrics make your think about your self and your life. This is one that you will obsessively want to play over and over again. -=4.5=-<br />7 - By Myself: The sound and the interpretation of this song at first makes your eyes open, but then the mixture of a Rap melody, then a intertwine of Rock makes this song notorious. This is more of an upbeat song, then its not... you will have to decide for yourself. -=4.5=-<br />8 - In The End: A fabulous slower-beat song , with piano sounding melody makes your indefinitely think about your life, and how things were for you. The lyrics will bring back memories, and the tone will make your think harder about your &#8220;fall&#8221;.  The whole assembly makes this song my second favorite on the CD. -=5.0=-<br />9 - A Place for my Head: The song never appealed to me, but seems to for others. Decide for yourself -=2.5=-<br />10 - Forgotten : The song never appealed to me either, but seemed to for others. Decide for yourself, yet again -=2.5=-<br />11 - Pushing Me Away: The soft beat at the start and then the progressive up rise makes this song a perfect completion to a excellent CD. The lyrics yet again touch your mind, bringing up thoughts and feelings. One of my favorites. -=4.5=-<br />Basically, this is one CD you mustn&#8217;t download of  &#8220;Morpheus&#8221; or &#8220;Bearshare&#8221;, but one that you ... will have to go buy. Trust me, this will be one CD you won&#8217;t be disappointed in. You&#8217;ll catch yourself singing to yourself one day, and this CD will include that song.
0399146253|1.0|I enjoyed the first few Scarpetta novels-back in the days when Kay Scarpetta was the Ultimate Ice Princess with a Brain who didn't wallow in her own sea of self-pity. Now Kay is nearly unbearable, and now when she reminds us for the umpteenth time how flighty and obnoxious her sister Dorothy is and how she wishes Dorothy wasn't her sister, she fails to realize how obnoxious she herself has become and probably always was. She treated Benton Wesley like dirt when he was alive, now she is still mourning him ad nauseum three books later.  I couldn't picture the Kay Scarpetta of Postmortem bonking a 25 year old agent &quot;just because he was there&quot; as she did in Black Notice. And Pete Marino was much more bearable as the gruff but still tender cop in the beginning of the series; now he is just a redneck loudmouth that keeps ruining dinner parties and sticking his foot in his mouth every other sentence. The only character that I still find likeable is Lucy, and I wish Ms. Cornwell would put the others in drydock and give Lucy her own novel. She is a much more intriguing, interesting character than her aunt and Marino. Let's hope the Scarpetta novel due out next year will find Kay doing something entirely different; namely, being over Benton Wesley, stop acting like there is nobody in the world as perfect as herself, and get back to solving crime through medicine without all the bile and recrimination and pity parties. Oh, and transfer Marino to the other side of the state and have Dorothy move next door to Kay. That should liven things up a bit.

0783225733|5.0|As it seems many other reviews have noted, Apollo 13 is a great film.  It captures a gripping story with good detail and technical accuracy.  Throughout the film, special effects really bring the scenes to life.  From the launch sequence to the final splashdown, all of the effects are very professional and not overdone.<br />While I really enjoyed the movie to begin with, I found the bonus material on the DVD made me enjoy it even more.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the documentary had actual content and wasn't just a bumch of clips from the film.  In the documentary you'll learn how the story was woven into scenes in the movie and get a much better idea of how well done the movie is.  The documentary also talks about where liberties were taken with the story line and what tidbits of the movie actually weren't added to the script for emotional value.  A highly recommended disc.

I don't like steeks and the book did not convince me that they are anything laudable in making a sweater. I also dislike the cult following that has grown up around this woman. Her daughter has perpetuated it. The book is in my library but it did not inspire my knitting.
B00003CXMG|4.0|I thought that Almost Famous was a terrific movie; probably one of the best films of the year.  It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over and over but never get bored of.  I give it four stars not because the film itself was lacking anything, but because I just felt the DVD could have had a little more on it like a director's commentary.  Cameron Crowe is one of the best filmmakers of the decade and he certainly succeeded in making Almost Famous great.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I've been listening to Stevie since the mid 70's. While her other solo albums have shone, this one is by far her best. I put it on this afternoon and was singing along by the 3rd verse of the 2nd song! Very lyrical. Excellent musical experimentation. I love that she collaborated on so much of this album-it shows. All the contributing artists are in top form. Good job Stevie!
B000028U0Y|5.0|The impact of Johnny Cash's proto bad-boy on country, blues, and rock is inestimable, which doesn't even speak to the fact that the man is a great entertainer. If you are a serious music fan, your musical education isn't complete without Live At Folsom Prison. This isn't a singles record, this is an album; you put it on to hear the whole thing. The performance itself is tight and structured, just like the venue. The recording is especially atmospheric - the reverb bouncing off the concrete walls, the sounds of doors slamming in the background, and an interruption by a prison announcement. Cash and the band (which includes the brilliant Luther Perkins and Carl Perkins -  think Blue Suede Shoes) seem unflappable and completely at ease, belying the actual tension of the gig. This reissue restores the original recording to its raw, warts-and all-feel, in direct contrast to the sanitized version that I grew up with: four songs have been restored to the set due to increased available length, plus Cash's interaction with the audience and the profanity (tasteful by today's standards) has been re-introduced, revealing the incredibly gritty nature of this record. Plus, the packaging is incredible: the handwritten note from Cash, describing why he felt compelled to make this album, the liner notes, and an appreciation from Steve Earle round out the package to create not merely a reissue, but a full restoration. If you are hungry for something more substantial than the latest Clapton disc or Zeppelin reissue, you won't regret a minute of this terrific album.
B0000033P2|4.0|ELP fans will happily debate forever the point at which the band reached its creative peak but there is a firm consensus that their early years were their finest. Whether the absolute best was Tarkus, Trilogy or Brain Salad Surgery is secondary to the simple fact that Trilogy is one of the finest pieces of work that this band did.<br />The secret of their music is that they put together a set of talents the like of which had rarely been seen before let alone moulded into a single unit. The opening salvo, (The Endless Enigma Part One, Fugue and The Endless Enigma Part Two) illustrates this perfectly.<br />To deal with Carl Palmer first, in the early seventies he was finding ways of breaking up rhythms that had never been heard before. Nothing on Trilogy is quite as radical as his drumming on Tarkus but nonetheless, he was doing things here with sticks and skins that nobody else had tired.<br />In terms of rock music, Keith Emerson is an outstanding talent but that does not give full account of his real contribution. On the classical concert circuit, keyboard performance talent such as his is not unique but never before had this been combined with the kind of driven creative rock intensity of his contemporary guitar greats.<br />Greg Lake is often overlooked in comparison with the other two members of the band but that does not do him justice. As well as his distinctive voice, his bass guitar work is the perfect match for Emerson's keyboard playing. If you listen to the opening suite and try to imagine it with an ordinary, unimaginative bass line, you will appreciate that he adds his own dimension to the music.<br />Trilogy is a nice balance of the range of ELP's style. After &quot;The Endless Enigma&quot; comes &quot;From the Beginning&quot; a typical Greg Lake ballad. After that the band switches into exuberant fun mode for &quot;The Sheriff&quot; and an adaptation of Aaron Copeland's &quot;Hoedown&quot;.  The opening drums on the first of those two serves notice ofwhat is to come.<br />Those tracks complete the opening side of the original vinyl release and, together with the title track which opened the second side, they form a powerful statement of the band's ability. The next track, &quot;Living Sin&quot; is the least convincing here and that is mainly because Greg Lake's voice does not really suit the style that he is trying to deliver. Finally, comes &quot;Abaddon's Bolero&quot; which is closely derived from Ravel's &quot;Bolero&quot; but which is curiously not credited as such on the sleeve notes. It's OK to listen to but, unlike most of ELP's covers, it does not really deliver much that was not in the original though Grek Lakes bass playing does stand out.<br />Trilogy is a good introduction to ELP though I think that Tarkus or their first album &quot;Emerson, Lake and Palmer&quot; server that purpose better. If you do like Trilogy, you will appreciate any of the albums that came before it and you might like to listen to music by Yes from the same time frame.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|First of all, this is a bad movie.  Let's get that out of the way.  Another thing, this movie is a remake of another movie that came out in 1974, as opposed to the sixties, as another reviewer has said.  A person shouldn't say a movie is &quot;good&quot; just because it had cool cars in it.  If &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; had cool cars, would the movie be any good?  This is just another mindless piece of rubbish from Jerry Bruckhiemer whom has yet to impress me.
B000002BBY|5.0|Yes, I know the Gallagher's are arrogant.  I even saw them in concert and discovered that they have the combined personality of a dead goldfish.  But with music like this, who cares? <br />It's pretty popular in this day and age to dislike Oasis.  Robbie Williams has turned it into an art form.  But there's no denying that Noel Gallagher can write a tune like no other.  And Liam turns his big brother's songs into instant classics.  Bonehead, Guigsy and Whitey add their own touches, but when it comes down to it, Oasis is a family business. <br />This album runs like a greatest hits album.  Every song is an instant classic, and I'm not exaggerating.  First there's the hits (count them, all six of them).  &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, &quot;Don't look back in anger&quot;, &quot;Morning glory&quot;, &quot;Champagne supernova&quot;, &quot;Roll with it&quot;, &quot;Some might say&quot;.  All classic singalongs which will never fail to put a smile on your face.  This leaves only six tracks.  There's two unnamed instrumentals which are slotted into appropriate places, to give us time to recover from the classic pop contained within.  The remaining songs &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Hey now!&quot;, &quot;Cast no shadow&quot; and &quot;She's electric&quot; could very easily be hits, if Oasis chose to release them.  But I'm sure there's laws against releasing every single song on an album as a single.  And I don't think the fans would be very happy. <br />It's only been downhill for Oasis since this album.  Their arrogance reached an all-time high after this album (and its singles) became chart successes.  They beat Blur in the great Britpop war of the 90's.  Noel fought the evils, Liam acted like the immature kid brother.  Noel wished AIDS upon Damon Albarn from Blur.  Critics ripped through their follow up albums &quot;Be here now&quot; and &quot;Standing on the shoulder of giants&quot;, which despite not being terrible, didn't sit anywhere near this album or their debut. <br />This album remains a testimony to the great band that Oasis were, and may never be again.
B00004U8H4|5.0|I saw this movie then decided to read the book and I was suprised how well the movie held to the feel of the book.  This movie isn't so much about the violence, as it is about the state of society during the materialistic 80s.  This was the time people started regonizing pop culture and that is very evident in this movie as Patrick discusses his pop music tastes.  The violence, although somewhat graphic and distrubing, has this weird comic, satrical feel to it.  Christian Bale plays the part of the psycho to a T.  In an interview I heard him say that he played the part as though he was an alien trying to play a human.  This man knows what he's doing when it comes to acting.  Check this one out if you're not squeamish.  THAT'S IT, I'M DONE!

B000059R8Y|5.0|In my opinion, Eric Clapton is the best rock guitarist. He can play a variety of styles and his fingering is flawless. On Reptile, Eric displays his prowess in a variety of styles. This CD almost feels like a greatest hits. Eric opens and closes the CD with an acoustic instrumental, which gives you a feel for how good he really is on guitar. He records a J.J. Cale song, which will remind you of &quot;Cocaine&quot;, which Cale also wrote. His blues songs here are fantastic and the addition of the Impressions on backup vocals is pure genius. There are also some songs representing Clapton's more pop styling. However, no matter the style of the song, everything works.    Production on this CD is also very good with just the right players adding the right notes. What makes this CD really shine is Eric's guitar. Reptile is one of Clapton's best and will end up being a classic.

Ewan's voice is wonderful, as was hinted at from his previous singing in &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;.  &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot; and &quot;El Tango de Roxanne&quot; are simply intoxicating.  The only real torture is having to wait another three weeks for the film to open!
6305807086|5.0|This is my third favorite film behind American Beauty and Magnolia.  I must say that is probably the most original film I've seen in a long, long time.  Granted the themes aren't that original, but the ways that the characters go about getting to their goals is just insane.  Jonze's use of dull colors to downplay the emotion of the story.  The actors are awesome.  John Cusack's character is the greatest sad character I've ever scene. Charlie Kaufman has a great up and coming career in Hollywood and I'm interested in whether he'll eventually begin to direct his own work.  I'm looking foward to his next project Adaptation.

0140067477|4.0|This book is really simple to read.  In fact, it's so simple I highly recommend it to young people.  Young being between the ages of 8 and 18.  This is a quick read and easy to understand because of the authors simplistic style; straight and to the point.  Some adults may find it hard to get through the conversations with Pooh and his friends.  I really enjoyed the ancient antidocts and was less enthused with the Pooh conversations.  But I would imagine that it is those conversations that endear a large amount of readers to the book.  &quot;It's the same thing.&quot;
B000053VAF|5.0|The first time I read this script it was about the time the movie went into production, and I instantly couldn't wait for it to come out.  When it came out I think I saw it 5 or 6 times in the theatre.  This film is not anti religion in any sense.  It just looks at things in organized religion, specifially Catholicism, that are never really thought about and brings them to light.  Smith is a writer before he is a director and ever since Clerks you can see that with scenes where he just sets up the camera and lets it capture his dialogue.  I guess that's something to work on, but it works cause you don't really notice because the dialogue is so good.  The performance are really great especially Affleck, Damon, and Rickman.  I'm going to be sad seeing Jay and Silent Bob bid farewell in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, but it's for the best for Smith.  THAT'S IT, I'M DONE!
B000050XEI|5.0|I first encountered Enya with her &quot;watermark&quot; cd. I played that cd until I could almost sing (or hum) it in my sleep. &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; was the second cd I bought, and I now have a few other Enya cd's on the way as a result.<br />In my opinion, Enya is a modern Beethoven. Often, what she does with the music is more important and meaningful than anything that could be said in words. And when she does use words, it becomes all the more powerful of a melody.<br />The title track from this cd demonstrates her powerful ability to move you with only a (fairly) simple piano melody. First in melancholy here, and then to a sort of weird euphoria with &quot;Silver Inches&quot;.<br />If you are a fan of classical music, or Enya, I highly recommend this cd and almost any of Enya's other's albums. You won't be disappointed.

I must admit, I wasn't all that hyped about seeing this movie (not a big fan of Cage), but because a friend knew I loved fast cars, well...<br />How much of a movie can you make about car theft?  Not a lot, but who cares?  That's not the point--the whole idea is to drool and cough over these gorgeous sets of wheels.  Angelina Jolie doesn't play a major role, and even though we know that Sway and Memphis were once involved, there's 0% romance between them now.  No biggie because she's in the film for 2 reasons (I think):  give the guys a pretty woman to look at along with the cars, and for the ladies who watch this who love cars like I do, she's a character to identify with.<br />The supporting cast members do a good job in being just that--support.  They're important in that they help boost cars and not much more.  The whole story exists on one premise alone, and that's Memphis' love for his brother Kip.  Memphis re-enters the life to save Kip's life, and since the task of stealing 50 cars in 48 hours is a daunting one, he needs help from some old friends.  I really liked the other members of the crew and wish some of them had had more camera time and lines...<br />How's the sound on this DVD?  NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING!  I can't imagine trying to watch this movie any other way--it must've been incredible in a theater.  Sound so good, you swear the cars are racing by you in the room!  WHOA.  Nothing like hearing a nitrous car in surround sound...  Saddest part of the movie?  The way the Shelby looks at the end--that ticked me off/made me cry.<br />If you're in this for a heavy story, you will be incredibly disappointed.  If you're in this for the cars, prepare to love it.<br />After you finish watching this, it's no suprise that you'll want to get in your own car and see how fast you can make it go!
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is a perfect example of rural depression era music.  But it will make you anything but depressed.  It completely captures the mood of the movie and the period.  People wrote upbeat songs about how miserable they were.  Big Rock Candy Mountain is my personal favorite.  If you enjoyed the movie.  I would definitely buy this CD
B00003CWTI|5.0|This film is simply amazing.  Everything about it is craftsmanship.  The screenplay is mind boggling if you think about it.  I mean it's hard enough for an audience to care about one character for an hour and a half, but P.T. Anderson gets us to care about 9 characters for 3 hours.  The only way I could place this film in a catagory is to say it's an everyday epic with heart.  The cinematography of this film is simply beautiful. Every scene is lit in a way that adds to the feeling of film.  The performances are amazing too.  John C. Reilly makes me laugh so hard no matter what he's doing, and him playing COPS is so great.  And if you have the DVD check out the outtakes in the color bars section, it's worth it.  THAT'S IT, I'M DONE!
0440219078|5.0|...it is such a good book, when I started reading it, I couldn't stop. I didn't have dinner,or lunch, when i started reading, my mom had to take the book away from me, to stop me! it made me cry in the middle, and at the end, I love this book, it's really good, so before you jus turn the page, and say, nah, that doesn't look like a good book, well YOUR WROUNG! I would buy this book, if your like 8-50, even adults can read it. so when your out of good books to read, just get THE GIVER.
0452282152|5.0|This book is one of my top ten favorites. Once you start reading, you won't be able to put it down.
0553275569|5.0|For a very long time &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; was my favorite book (excluding the Bible, which is unique).  Even after reading Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; I'm not sure Wolfe's book has been dislodged from its position.<br />Wolfe begins to work his literary magic on the first page.  A young, beautiful woman is worried about her husband, a Navy test pilot, having heard that there has been a plane crash.  Space buffs like me reading the book are fascinated to realize that the woman is Jane Conrad, wife of Pete Conrad (which, incidentally, tells us that the bad news that day won't be about her husband).  If this scene appeared in a different book about the space program, even one as superb as Andrew Chaikin's &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot; or Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger's &quot;Apollo 13,&quot; the account of events, while exciting and suspenseful, would remain on a somewhat mundane plane of everyday reality.  Wolfe's glittering, idiosyncratic literary style lifts events into a world of super-reality.  We experience Jane Conrad's concern and dread as if we were Jane Conrad.  Perhaps more than any other book I have read, &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; has caused me to remember the events it relates as if I lived through them rather than reading about them.<br />One noteworthy feature of Wolfe's style in this book is his nearly Wagnerian use of verbal &quot;leitmotiven,&quot; key phrases which pop up over and over in the book and come to convey far more than the simple content of the words.  Anyone who has read the book will remember for a long time Wolfe's use of such phrases as &quot;bad streak,&quot; &quot;Flying and Drinking and Drinking and Driving,&quot; &quot;the Integral,&quot; &quot;our rockets always blow up,&quot; &quot;the Presbyterian Pilot,&quot; &quot;single combat warrior,&quot; &quot;ziggurat,&quot; and, of course, &quot;the right stuff.&quot;<br />The book also contains the funniest set-piece in any book I have ever read, the description of thecelebration when the astronauts and their families first visit Houston, including the fan dance by the ancient Sally Rand.  Interestingly, in the excellent film version of the book this scene was transformed from a hilarious comedy sequence into something elegiac, intercut with the sequence of Chuck Yeager bailing out of a plane (which happened on a different day in reality and in the book) to create drama and suspense.  In this radically different form the two sequences are just as effective in the movie as they are in the book.<br />&quot;The Right Stuff&quot; has sometimes been criticized for being overly fictionalized, or at least speculative.  These criticisms probably have a great deal of validity, but they do not alter the fact that &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; is the definitive evocation of that brief era around 1960 when almost anything, good or bad, seemed possible.  It is an unforgettable literary achievement.
B00000ILBK|1.0|When I saw this &quot;Trek&quot; film in the theatres, I almost fell asleep in the theatre.  No Action.  Barely any plot.  No intense character interaction.  Out of all of the Star Trek films, this one really bit the big one.  The movie was that bad.
B000000993|5.0|At 38 years old, I suppose most Tool fans would consider me a bit long in the tooth to appreciate their music.  After hearing their songs on our local rock station (KSJO-FM, San Jose, YEAH!) they really grew on me to the point where I just had to have their catalog!  &quot;Undertow&quot; is unquestionably my favorite so far (waiting with baited breath for the new one to come out next week...).  Even after MONTHS of listening to it almost every morning during my workout (my gym music rotation has been Undertow/Aenima/Mer de Noms for the past 8 months) I have not gotten the least bit bored - it's an extremely motivating CD to listen to while doing hard cardio.<br />I never tire of listening to Maynard's vocals - surely he is one of the most vocally gifted artists recording today.
B000059WOD|5.0|It's hard to put this album into a particular category of music.  It has the powerful drive of good alternative music mixed with lines of melodic rap.  The sound that Linkin Park produces is incredibly good.  The sound is similar to Limp Bizkit, but clean and higher quality.  If you've heard them on the radio, you've probably heard a lot of &quot;One Step Closer&quot;-a good song, but not one of the best on the album.  The 2 bonus tracks at the end of this album add a lot.  While the rest of the songs on the album have a similar sound, both of the bonus tracks prove that Linkin Park can do an unbelievable job at setting more than one kind of mood.  The chorus of &quot;High Voltage&quot; is distorted to sound a bit electronic.  This song drops the heavy guitars and features more rap than the other songs.  It's a good song, but nothing to write home about.  &quot;My December&quot; on the other hand, is perhaps the best mellow ballad I have ever heard, with a sound similar to that of Counting Crows' &quot;Colorblind&quot;.  &quot;My December&quot;, however is a bit less sedative and is a song that you will want to play over and over again the first time you hear it.  This song altogether abandons the rap-rock genre with a refreshing slow, reflective mood.  Every song on this album is high quality, not one is a disappointment.  This CD is a must-have for every collection!
0451169514|5.0|It is truly a masterpiece. Everything about this book makes it so. The characters are wonderful-Bill, Ben, and all the rest of the Lucky 7 are so real you will believe they are the kids down the street. Only they have more on their minds than just the everyday games that most kids play...these children are up against the ultimate terror, a thing which can turn into their innermost fears. It is this feature which makes &quot;It&quot; so terrifying. It can be anything.  <br />This book is like an entire world confined within a cover, and you will find that the world of the book often intrudes-no, that's not a good word to describe it-you'll find the world of the book often appears in your thoughts. I find myself thinking of this book often, another great feature. The book is indeed thought-provoking; long after you finish it you will be thinking about the events related that occurred in Derry, Maine, a town that is, as the intro says, as hauntingly familiar as your own hometown. You must read this; to do otherwise is to deprive yourself of King's best work, a true masterpiece of literature. I enjoyed every page of It and will continue to enjoy it many times in the future. Do yourself a favor and buy this masterpiece so that you may return to Derry anytime you wish, and meet all the deeply-developed characters who live there.
B00000BKDW|5.0|As some people say, this is the last killer album. As other people say, this is the first Golden-Era album. As a lot of people say, this the best album. In what do you believe? Is this all true? Maybe.<br />Personally, I love this album. I still don't think in it as the best, but is certainly one of the best. Amazing, the most incredible tour of the band. Steve is playing not just amazingly, but doing more than great bass lines. Adrian is exploding in creativity and speed in the solos. Dave is making guitar duels with Adrian, supporting the musics and making great solos too. Nicko is more confident, the music is conduted by him, he plays heavily and with huge technique. And Bruce is amazing as always, singing with technique and emotion.<br />Aces High is one of the best Maiden's musics. Great introduction, amazing speed guitars, superb bass (very difficult), perfect drumwork and perfect vocals are here. Fast and wild. Wonderful. 101/100<br />2 Minutes to Midnight is another \\"greatest hit\\". Adrian could create an immortal introduction and amazing guitar riffs. The bass is amazing here, Steve does more than sustain the music. Nicko supports everything and Bruce completes everything with mad and cynic vocals. The lyrics are top note. There is a part in the music, from 3 minutes till 4 minutes and 10 seconds, that I repeat a lot of times. Is the solo. A great moment in life. 101/100  <br />Flash Of The Blade has an amazing guitar introduction. But the music structure is, somehow, poor. It's a great music, but no special. The vocals are not so good. Well, I didn't like so much. The voice is good, but musically, didn't sound so good. 80/100<br />The Duelist is an dramatic epic with a furious guitar and bass line. The drums are good too. The lyrics are good, even repeating itself so much. The nice thing is the description of a fight with swords. At First, I fought that was Bruce who wrote it. He is a \\"swordsman\\", so... The vocals are very good, semi despair style. 90/100<br />Back In The Village is a good track, no more. I don't like it so much. There's no reason. The bass is good, as the drums. But not captivates me. 70/100<br />Powerslave is amazing. It has a sinister atmosphere, mystic. One of the best musics played by Steve, in my opinion. The guitar is also great. But the real show is Bruce. He interprets this music. HIS music. He sings with anger, with arrogance, amazing. The solo is also very good. It's slow, the guitar is perfect and then it grows, the power of the music is back again. 100/100<br />Rime Of The Ancient Mariner is... huge. In everyway. Huge lyrics, huge musicianship, huge vocals, huge emotions evocated. In the introduction you feel that the music will be a show. There's always a independent guitar and one making the music go on. The bass is very impressive here, playing independently. It's possible because it's Nicko that makes the music continues. And Bruce is there. One more time, he interprets the music. He puts emotion in it. Long notes, quick sentences, anger, an amazing actuation. When the music turns slow, you hear the wood door, the tunders, the music becomes sinister and Bruce say some verses... AMAZING. 101/100<br />Losfer Words... is instrumental and I don't like so much. Looks like they used the riffs from Losfer... in The Duelist. So, I prefer to hear The Duelist.<br />This album is amazing. Great classic metal. The music is not dated. Sounds like it was recorded last week. If you know the \\"new Maiden\\" and is thinking in catch something from the older stuff, this is the best album. Is not so different from \\"new Maiden\\" and has some things from the previous albums. I did this way and today I love this band. With this album, an evolution of Piece Of Mind, they could be the rulers of heavy metal, the best all around the world.<br />UP THE IRONS!!!
B00004WG2X|1.0|This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice suffers from an unfortunate screenplay. Fay Weldon has done a gross disservice to Jane Austen by continually putting the words of one character in the mouth of another. The Bennet sisters lose all individuality in this adaptation. The serious, studious Mary is shown gossiping and socializing. The kind-hearted Jane is shown catty and mean-spirited. The 17-year old Kitty is miscast as a woman in her 30's. Weldon has thrown in absurdities such as Elizabeth's marathon run from Lambton to Pemberly to look for her aunt and uncle. Elizabeth Garvie makes a valiant effort to portray Elizabeth Bennet but is forced to do numerous voice-over narratives from the novel that slow the action to a crawl. Poor David Rintoul is the saddest of the cast. A man with a funny looking head who is given little to do but walk about stiffly showing no more emotion than a wooden Indian. This adaptation has its passionate advocates but I would suggest renting it before spending a dime. The BBC/A&amp;E adaptation with Jenifer Ehle and Colin Firth is much superior.
6305433909|5.0|I love this movie. It actually show's what kind of happend to my school's choir (even though my school wasn't on the verge of shutting down we just needed a choir teacher) we had a contest that was coming up and we had no teacher then we got one out of the blue and she changed us kind of like this movie did and every one in my choir adores this movie!!! It's very inspiring to not give up when all hope is lost and to follow your dreams!!!
B00000BKDV|4.0|I bought The Number Of The Beast album. I loved it. Then, I read that this one was a classic too, better produced. A lot of fans said that this one was the best Maiden&#8217;s album. I bought it recently. And I was, somehow, disappointed.<br />I&#8217;m not saying that the album is bad. It&#8217;s sure amazing. But I expected more. A lot more. I was waiting another 22 Acacia Avenue, another Hallowed Be Thy Name. I didn&#8217;t find it here. But it&#8217;s ok, the album is wonderful. The guys are playing even better than in NOTB. Bruce (as always) makes the show. Steve&#8217;s bass is cleaner, he tries some different notes here. Adrian is even better. Dave is there, very well too. The best new is Nicko, even if it is not his best album. His technique is really impressive. Steve could do what he always wanted in the musics. The band was in top form, very creative. <br />Well, let&#8217;s go to the musics.  Where Eagles Dare is a great album opener. It has some fantastic drums and guitars. Bruce&#8217;s voice is fantastic here, with a great range and good falsettos. He shows why he is called \\"Air Raid Siren\\". 95/100<br />Revelations is one of the best. Very soft some times, very heavy other times. I feel like flying listening this music. Bruce is very emotional here. Dave is perfect and the solos are amazing. Harris is here, one of his best musics. Nicko just sustaining the music. Great lyrics From Bruce are here too. 100/100<br />Flight Of Icarus is amazing too. A not-so-heavy music. Great drums and vocals (one of the best) are present. The solo is kinda simple, just appropriated. 100/100<br />Die With Your Boots On is good. The chorus is long, I didn&#8217;t like it. I didn&#8217;t understand if Bruce was being cynic in some parts, but sounds some strange. You&#8217;ll find a good bass line and good guitars. The music is better in the end. 85/100<br />The Trooper is the greatest hit of this album. But I don&#8217;t like it SO much. Is really good but some chessy. Theguitars are pretty much the same the previous track. Bruce is really mad here&#8230; 90/100<br />Still life is the most emotional track. Well, with the most emotional vocal. The guitars here are superb. It just loses to Revelations in this album, I think. 100/100<br />The other two are boring and repetitive. 60/100 for both. To Tame A Land is kinda interesting, but didn&#8217;t catch me. 65/100.<br />Well, you want to decide: buy or not? Buy, if you liked Powerslave and NOTB. Don&#8217;t start with this one. Is very good, but I don&#8217;t think it is the best Maiden&#8217;s album. For Maiden&#8217;s fans, buy. You&#8217;ll like it.      An important thing to say is that this album is an evolution in Maiden&#8217;s history. In this one, Steve left space for the other guys. Bruce is here with two lyrics, Adrian wrote too and other things as musicianship were changed. They became to make literature-based music. The harmony of the two guitars became to be strong here. These are the marks of Iron Maiden. The Number Of The Beast showed them to the world and Powerslave made them conquerthe world. But the most important album was this one. So, if you wanna know the band, know why it is as it is, don't waste more time. Buy this one.<br />UP THE IRONS!
B000002GD8|5.0|This is their fourth release and is once of the better in their catalog.  <br />Standout tracks are &quot;Sister Moonshine&quot; (beautiful 12-string acoustic guitar)  &quot;A Soapbox Opera&quot; (One of Roger's finest compositions) &quot;Poor Boy&quot; (brilliant clarinet solo from John...right out of the 40's) and &quot;The Meaning&quot; (a moody art-rock piece.) <br />The cover art is also one of my favourites. Too bad it has been reduced to a dinky 5&quot; square...<br />if you still aren't sure about this one, listen to the samples, and I'm sure you'll be hooked.
B00005A1PR|5.0|It has been a long time sincce I've been this blown over by a recording. The music is divine, the lyrics are so rich and positive and the delivery is a celebration of life. What more can you say?<br />Musically, the stylings remind me of Judy Collins or Joni Mitchell, but with Soul thats been working out (no steroids here, the message is too pure). The background has a wonderful jazzy feel to it, but never gets in the way of the vocals. There is a strong resemblence to Stevie Wonder's classic \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\", but the music is uniquely hers.<br />After you listen to the this album for the music, adjust the tone settings to bring up the vocals. You will hear a celebration of femininity and ethnicity without trashing anyone else. What a joy to hear someone proud to be themselves without doing it at the expense of someone else (\\"Video\\"). The lyrics can be sexy (\\"Brown Skin\\") without it being in your face..., poetry versus [anything explicit] is so common on today's pop culture. Like well designed clothes, the lyrics reveal eough to tempt us while concealing enough you don't mind seeing it in public.<br />Whatever the oppposite of the blues is, this is the best example of it. Instead of deceit and broken promises, the stories tell us of kept promises and timeless wisdom from our elders. Plenty of respect here and not a hint of \\"dis\\" anyplace.<br />I want to hear more of her and I hope she stays as pure as this album through her entire career.
0553583182|5.0|The power of positive thinking is very interesting. Accordingly, &quot;the problem with most people is that they have no invisible means of support.&quot; First he enlightens you as to the nature of the subjective and irrational subconscious mind and the objective and rational conscious. What you consciously believe, think, and reason, is impressed upon the subconscious without argument... it does not reason. (however a suggestion cannot impose something on the subconscious mind against the will of the conscious mind. The conscious mind has the power of rejection.)Thus a continous cycle occurs. The conscious feeds the subconscious with seeds, which etch on to the infinite ocean of intelligence, which in turn will manifest back into the conscious world. If you consciously assume something as true, even though it may be false, your subconscious mind will accept it as true and proceed to bring about results which must necessarly follow, because you consciously assumed it to be true. He indirectly identifies this divine subconscious (also the Lord) with the equivalent of either the Vedic atman or Gnostic divine spark. [pp. 212 &quot;Your subconscious never grows old. It is timeless, ageless, and endless. It is a part of the universal mind of God which was never born, and it will never die.&quot;] The practice of manifesting this cycle of the mind and of divine order he coins as &quot;scientific prayer.&quot; He also uses the subconscious to explain why miraculous phenomena occur in all religions and regions of the world. Thus the infinite intelligence of the divine mind has no preference nor affiliation with external religions. That brings me to another compliment for Dr. Joseph Murphy. He seems to be a Christian, atleast somewhat of one deducted from his recurrent Bible quoting. But with the subject matter of the unconscious mind he brings fresh exegesis to scripture. And as I mentioned his note that the subconscious divinity is not unique to any religion or creed, healso acknowledges the fallacy of biblical traditions with all their superstitions of judgement and hellfire. &quot;The only sin is ignorance of the law, and the only punishment is the automatic reaction of man's misuse of the law&quot; pp. 182. He identifies nothing as inherently evil, e.g. sex or money, and does not believe in the common concept of Theism. By his intuition God = Life. He has realized that this is the only rational concept of any &quot;god.&quot; <br />pp. 66 &quot;The one healing power is called by many names---Nature, Life, God, Creative Intelligence, and Subconscious Power.&quot;
B000002U8G|4.0|Meddle is not as good as Dark Side, but you could see PINK FLOYD was on to something brilliant, the flow is very smooth and before you know it, the album is over and PINK FLOYD has taken you on a journey, something they are just so amazing at. The album kicks off with a Rocker ONE OF THESE DAY'S a psycadelic grove machine that's led by David Gilmore's terrific slide work, the album get's very dreamy at time's folk like, A PILLOW OF WINDS is so comforting to hear, SAN TROPEZ is jazz lounge like, with a touch of humor, the album seems to have a great cadance to it. Echoes the last song is easily one of my favorite PINK FLOYD songs, i could spend a whole day writing about the song Echoes but i'll spare you, Echoes is part 1 of Dark Side Of The Moon, you can hear it, you can feel that they were on the brink of something truely incredible. Probably the most underated FLOYD album MEDDLE in my book is TOP'S.
B00003CXE6|2.0|This has to be the worst movie ever to win an Academy Award for best picture.  The opening battle scene is impressive, but the movie takes a nose dive from there.  The plot is incoherent. The action sequences are edited in such a way as to completely obscure the action.  The acting is not terrible, but the script is simply ludicrous from beginning to end.  <br />This movie wasted two and a half hours of my life that I will never get back.
B000002B35|5.0|WOW!!! This Album sounds AMAZING!!! I'm not a big fan of live album's but PULSE just blew me away. The cover is one of my favorite's, you could spend an hour just looking at the cover art. I was also stunned hearing Dark Side Of The Moon in it's entirety. Pink does such a great job, David Gilmore and Tim Renwick have such an awsome chemistry, the two different styles of lead guitar playing sound's fabulous, Tim's slightly more technical and Dave's got a way of making three note's sound like there from heaven, nobody does it better, a tie, maby Jeff Beck? David Gilmore's voice is wonderful and Richard Wright sounds great to, the backup girl's are perfect like always, bass playing, technical and tastfull element's tight as ever with a healthy nick mason behind the kit. I also want to give plenty of cretit to the gentleman playing percussion and sax, just an all out incredible effert on PINK FLOYD'S part. I think I listen to PULSE more than any of the studio album's, it's that GOOD, no it's that GREAT!!
6302860253|5.0|The problem with most made for movie operas is that its seems to be limited to a stage production.  The prescence of a live performance is missed when viewing this type of production, and the acting is typically flat.  The soundtrack is usually poorly dubbed or has poor accoustics.<br />Not so with this production of Carmen.  It is the most beautiful, most charming and most invigorating opera movie I have ever seen.  Jules Mignes Johnson worked diligently to portray her character Carmen accurately as the gypsy cigarette factory worker with an overdriven libido and an eye for troublemaking.  As far as I'm concerned she completely overshadows Domingo, who looks ridiculous as a 50 year old private/sargeant who doesn't ever don a hat.  Unlike most female leads she looks and acts her part (i.e. unlike the 200 lb soprano's that are dying from tuberculosis in other opera productions!).<br />Escamillo is particulary entertaining as the vain bullfighter;  we can see the vanity and shallowness in both Carmen and Escamillo, and why they are attracted to each other.  Don Jose' is brooding and serious and we can see right away how this will not work well with the flirtatious Carmen.  All these characterizations are elements in this film that you will not see in other productions.<br />The choreography and cinemtography takes advantage of the expansive location and extras.<br />As an grand opera on a grand scale, I would highly recommend this movie.
B000001GQP|5.0|These are great musicians, folks. And this is really a fantastic performance. The much touted Previn recording doesn't begin to compare, in my opinion. Just listen to Previn in &quot;O Fortuna&quot;. It's too slow, for starters, and there's some rythmic instability in the climax in the second part that is really disconcerting. The Jochum, on the other hand, is right on the money; everything happens exactly when it should. Fischer-Dieskau is so good (as he always seems to be; does anyone else need to do Schoene Mullerin after FD and Gerald Moore?; or the Mahler Wunderhorn songs?) it's just no contest.
0671045857|5.0|After reading Jaws, my carefree days at the beach were ruined forever.  Likewise, after listening to The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, my camping gear was sold at the next yard sale.  While I can laugh off vampires and resurrected pets, getting lost in the woods could happen to anyone.  Trisha's indefatigable courage was awe inspiring.  I don't think I would last nine hours alone in the forest, much less nine days.  Anne Heche's child-like voice as nine year old Trisha is perfect and the story is wonderful.  Please, Mr. King, give us more books like this.  (This refers to the unabridged audio-book version)
B00004XOWM|1.0|Limp Bizkit is just a disgrace to rock, their sell-outs, their talentless, and the have millions of fans!!!! How can a band like Limp Bizkit sell more albums than a great band like A Perfect Circle, Pearl Jam, or Smashing Pumpkins? First off, I'll admit that I never really liked Limp Bizkit except for a few of their songs, but when this album came out I heard all these great reviews saying that Limp Bizkit has created a masterpiece. So I bought the CD. The first thing that I noticed was that Fred Durst is using the &quot;F&quot; word quite a bit on this album, especially &quot;Hot Dog&quot; where he says it about 50 times. I also read in someone's review that Limp Bizkit is just a band trying to sing about teen angst. What? Limp Bizkit has absolutlely NO EMOTION in their music!!! Oh, Let's go Rollin, Rollin, Rollin... dear God, what has happened to music? Another thing that really bugs me is that Fred Durst actually had the nerve to make fun of Trent Reznor... okay, Fred, first of all Trent actually has good songs, he doesn't sell out, and he has more talent in his pinky than you have in your whole body!!! All the songs are just completely terrible, with the exception of one song... &quot;Take a Look Around&quot; which actually has a bit of emotion and good lyrics. All the other songs are just terrible, especially &quot;Get Your Groove On.&quot; I'll admit that I'm NOT a rap fan, but this song is bad for even rap. Too bad that Limp Bizkit is so popular because they completely sold-out and they make terrible music. I guess we have MTV to thank for that.
B000059TPN|5.0|Never a dull moment in this is a great action flick.  This may be the best of its genre in a long, long time.  Jerry Bruckheimer has outdone himself.  The movie opens with the two great scenes, including the well planned (and almost perfectly implemented) break in at an Army arsenal and the disarming of a terrorist bomb by Cage at work.  The action does not let up until the final climactic struggles.<br />Great casting, with Sean Connery as a political prisoner (and former member of the British elite Special Air Service, the only man alive to break out of Alcatraz).  Add Nicholas Cage as  FBI agent (and self-described biochemical \\"super freak\\", who of course is grossly overmatched among these hard guys.  Their foil is Ed Harris, who is great  as a highly decorated military officer, disillusioned by the betrayal of his men during Desert Storm, and his cadre of soldiers.   The supporting roles include David Morse, John McGinley and Greg Collins as his loyal soldiers, and John Spencer as a less than honorable FBI director    They are all joined at Alcatraz prison, taken over by Harris and his men.  They hold a few hostages (irrelevant to the story), along with rockets filled with deadly poison gas. Unless the government pays the big bucks, they will unleash their deadly toxins. Only a sixty year old Connery can get them onto the Rock, with the support of a  group of Navy Seals and fighter planes to save the day.<br />Of course, they do.<br />Not a dull moment in this movie.
0140434143|5.0|Mansfield Park is the most amazing book I have ever read.  I consider myself a feverent &quot;Janeite&quot; and I definitely think that this is her best work.  It goes deeper than her other novels (which are also amazing) and her characters are incredibly realistic.  Every time I read this novel (I have read it four times already) I am in awe of the character Henry Crawford.  Her characterization of him is so beautifully accomplished.  Don't worry about the length of the book, once you get into it (which isn't difficult at all), you wont feel the length one bit.  Just sit back and prepare for a magical journey into the life of Fanny Price.
B0000062Y2|2.0|Just purchased this CD and believe it to be a re-mastered recording from the original sound track.  I had purchased the original LPs years ago and was very pleased with the recording.  The new CD is just awful in poor mixing of vocals, particularly the chorus and instruments for several tracks.  The worst include disc 1/track 9 &quot;Simon Zealates&quot;, disc 2/track 1 &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, and disc 2/track 7 &quot;Could We Start Again&quot;.  It's just very sloppy and quite awful recording engineering.  MCA/Universal should be ashamed to put its name on this.  It's a shame because the singers, especially Ted Neely, Carl Anderson and Yvonne Elleman put their hearts into this film production and Andre Previn's conducting of the score was first rate.
0316777722|5.0|This latest book by David Sedaris is a scream. One of the wittiest &amp; humorous writers of our time. A must read.
B00000DI06|1.0|For people who are looking for nice easy listening, this is a CD that can be added to their collection.  However, for those looking for a serious musical exploration of the themes of life and death, Rutter's Requiem falls far short of the standard set by previous composers.  For the most part the music is too saccharine, inundated with cliches that remind the listener of Hollywood movie soundtracks.  The Sanctus even sounds somewhat like Christmas music.<br />In terms of the performance, the orchestra and choir do a very good job, and I applaud the choice of soloists -- very effective singing.

B00004YW6I|5.0|This is definately the best PJ Harvey has yet to offer. The girl simply rocks! She writes some stunning lyrics, and her voice has increased in its reflection of longing, satisfaction, frustration, and visual meditation. The music has been beautifully constructed as well, providing a wonderful soundscape for PJ Harvey. The cd is riddled with raw emotion and never loses its grooving edge. &quot;Big Exit&quot; instantly gets the blood flowing! It feels as if Harvey is speaking from a high podium to entice the passing masses of the busy streets. Her voice reaches out to grab you, and the music kicks with pure rock-n-roll thump. &quot;Good Fortune&quot; continues the journey into Harvey's visual and random occurrences. If music were to have a hit-and-run aspect, this song would be a perfect example. Harvey enjoys fumbling around on this song, talking about love adventures. She sings, 'In Chinatown / hung-over / you showed me just what I could do.' Harvey gives the listener a view into her day and night activities. I call it hit and run because once she gives you one tale in this song, she leaves and then comes with another enveloping adventure, connecting it to a rousing chorus, before the feeling fades and the next song plays. &quot;A Place Called Home&quot; is an optimistic tune about keeping a relationship going strong. This song just makes you want to hug and hold your partner or friend real tight! Harvey expresses her sentiments in this song saying, 'With love comes the day / just hold on to me / ......one day there'll be a place for us.' I enjoy this peaceful and spiritual tune, each time that I hear it. It truly grows on you. &quot;One Line&quot; describes what it is like to find the 'one' that you seemingly cannot forget or ever let go of. It could even relate to that first love you had, or that first or last deep encounter of a relationship that you experienced. This is the kind of song that you wake up to, in the morning, thinking about that 'one' person. Withthis song, Harvey conjures up a haunting modern-day Romeo and Juliet vision. &quot;Beautiful Feeling&quot; is probably the most abstract song on the album because it is interesting to try and pin-down the significance of the words. You definately have to read these lyrics! I like this song because it feels like Harvey is in your room reciting heavenly poetry over a quiet guitar hum. To me, it appears that she is talking about three things: the Sun and embracing the warm epiphany in her England to America journeys, then she is talking about the adolescence and growth of a yearning child, and then she ends with an observation of her rustling lover. As Harvey sings, 'It's such a beautiful feeling,' so YOU cannot miss listening to this song! Also with the abstract theme in mind, see what you can come up with, as to what true meaning lies within. &quot;The Whores Hustle and The Hustlers Whore&quot; unravels like a mystic spell. PJ asks for her surrounding elements to 'speak' to her, as she filters through the possible responses. &quot;This Mess We're In&quot; is such a calming song. Thom Yorke, from Radiohead, does a great guest vocal spot with Harvey. I like the brushing rhythms on this song and the way that pulsing riff gets caught in my mind, as I feel that City imagery getting closer. Towards the end of the song, Yorke and Harvey take turns singing out to each other, making a kind of separated lover's collage of vocal messages. &quot;You Said Something&quot; is like a cafe up-tempo folksy song. Harvey sings about her realm of New York City and a relationship that she seemingly cannot forget. &quot;Kamikaze&quot; would have to be the late 60s throw-back tune. I just get the picture of a lot of colors floating around while heads knod and bodys shake to this song's soaring destination. &quot;This Is Love&quot; truly contains that raw emotion I spoke of earlier. Harvey starts it off singing: 'I can't believe life's so complex / when I just wanna sit here and watch you undress.' She blends simplicity with life frustration, and effectively finds a way to sing about the love stuck in her bones. She just wants to get past all of the preliminary mess and just get close-- something that a lot of us, in beginning relationships, eagerly wish to do. &quot;Horses In My Dreams&quot; is the essential late-night song for deep contemplation. It is a very stripped-down piece with subtle vocals and acoustic elements. If you feel the need to get away from the world, just go for a night-town drive with this song playing. Harvey is trying to sort things out as well, singing 'I have pulled myself clear.' I absolutely love this song! The album closes with another wonderful gem: &quot;We Float.&quot; This song almost sounds like a bed-story for those who are trying to breakthrough the tribulations of society and life. It has a very quaint band trip-hop feel, allowing Harvey to reveal her longing rhyme structure and soothing voice. She says that we must just 'Take life as it comes....'<br />You absolutely have to get this cd. It is perfect for any listening situation simply because PJ rocks on this album! Definately her best work to date. PeAcE :-)
B000002JSV|5.0|The Sex Pistols Never Mind The Bullocks was released one year before Powerage was released in 1978.Hard rock and Punk stayed clear of one another at this time but i suggest any one who loves true rock n roll to listen to Never Mind The Bullocks and Powerage back to back and you won't hear much difference,just some serious rock n roll!Powerage was just as raw and energetic as any punk band at this time.This was a punk rock album!
B00000ILDE|5.0|Since each human seems to host only one Alien egg, why are the Aliens willing to have hundreds of their kind cut down in the line of duty just for the benefit of a few eggs?  Lose many to make a few.. hmm.<br />It's a miracle the species made that far into the future with that kind of evolutionary reasoning..  That said, the movie continues to deliver thrills on repeated viewings.
B00003ETJQ|5.0|This is one of the greatest films of all time.  When I say films, I mean &quot;films&quot; as it isn't really a movie.  Shot on 70mm in 24 countries around the world, the visuals in this are absolutely out of this world.  Complimented by the stirring soundtrack of Michael Stearns, every time I watch this film, it raises the deepest emotions from inside.  <br />It's message is simple - that every man and woman on this Earth are striving for something more, through religion, war, ceremony, class, etc..., we are searching long and hard.  As well, this film is unforgiving in the assesment of our failures along the way.<br />The most beautiful image in my mind is that of a family riding on a scooter with the sun glittering behind them as they calmly go about their business.  All of this is amplified by a stirring track by Lisa Gerard (Dead Can Dance) that finally disolves into a haunting Japanese dance.  <br />The director, Ron Fricke, I believe ironically enough worked in some degree on the set of Apocalypse Now with Francis Ford Coppola.  This would explain his expert use of 70mm in capturing this great piece of work...
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Listening to the soundtrack to the upcoming film &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; you almost anticipate the thing to fall flat on its face. It is such a HUGE commerical and artistic risk: untrained singers Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor headlining a period musical whose songs are mostly comprised of 70s and 80s hits. However, the risk pays off tremendously. Safer bets are the modern tracks by Beck, Fatboy Slim, and Christina Aguilera (et al), whose &quot;Lady Marmelade&quot; is a fun and energetic remake. The songs from the film stand well on their own as Kidman and (especially) McGregor stun the listener with their surprising range and vocal power. Disappointments are few but include a rocky start to a tango-influenced &quot;Roxanne&quot; remake and an odd, but ultimately winning, entry by Rufus Wainwright. Still, this is one of those CDs that pays off upon multiple plays when the tapestry of soaring music and snippits of modern lyrics blend into the subconcious. This CD isn't for all listeners as &quot;Lady Marmelade&quot; would have you believe, as I'm sure the movie will be. However, true lovers of musicals will not be disappointed by the substantial artistic talent on display in this memorable CD.
0805062971|5.0|The most frequent complaint I've heard about this book is that its too short. Well, lemme tell you something...Long Books Get Old. I don't care if you've read a solid gold, Godfatheresque book, at some point during your reading you lost interest, if only for a fleeting second. I won't lie, I went through that fleeting moment in Fight Club, but believe you me...it was very freaking fleeting, man. Very, very fleeting. Very. This book's genius is in its conciseness, and in the end you will think, &quot;Damn. How did Chuck do that in so few pages?&quot;
B00004ZD69|5.0|With a name like &quot;Godspeed You Black Emperor!&quot; you would think that this band are either a  no-brainer death-metal combo or a weird japanese band like Merzbow, or Boom Boom Satellites and when you discover that one of the tracks on this album is called &quot;Cancer Towers on Holy Road Hiway&quot; you would be inclined to think the former, but Godspeed You Black Emperor are a far cry from this, and they are probably as close as you'll get to classical music for the 21st Century   After the apocalyptic feel of &quot;fsharpasharp(infinity)&quot;and the the deathly drone of &quot;new riot for zero kanada e.p.&quot; ,&quot;lift your skinny fists...&quot; is the glorious phoenix from the flames for the Canadian post-rock nine-piece and this is clearly evident after hearing the albums opening few minutes. Titled &quot;Storm&quot; the first track stirs slowly and then builds up, layer on layer with a marching drumbeat feel and loads of guitarnoise and cello and stuff, but it never climaxes, but just peters out, and the album stays pretty still for a while. About twenty minutes in and there is some kind of grating mexican showdown, which transforms into what can only be described as aliens doing a cover version of &quot;Providence&quot; by Sonic Youth.  The album is full of inspired moments (which I can't name because i can't follow the damned diagram that came in the packaging) like about halfway through the final track &quot;Lift Yr Skinny Fists&quot; there is some beautiful echoey glockenspiel stuff which explodes into a full band rock-out with violins crying out in the background. There is lots of background noise of people talking , similar to Mogwai,like on disc 2 there is a minute of this guy called Murray Ostril remeniscing over how good Coney Island used to be.  Lots of &quot;Lift...&quot;  has triumphant moments and the only thing that annoys me is that it falls asleep inbetween those moments sometimes, its certainly strenuous trying to listen to the whole thing in one go, but it is worth it, as these guys have put my faith back into music. Just don't try and do a cover version of any of their stuff.
0684847817|5.0|Ah, I remember that day. Just browsing the bookstore when this book caught my eye. I went ahead looking at other things but it kept tugging at me. I had always had a love of the fae and decided I'd give it a look. I knew instantly as I held the book in my hands, before I even opened it, that I had to have it. Upon opening it I was drawn into a state of awe. With each page I flipped I became more enthralled. Who painted these I wondered! And to my surprise when I looked at the artist, and what he had done, Mr. Froud had been a part of my life for some time now, I just never knew it. All those years ago when I grew up with Labyrinth and the Dark Crystal, watching my videos till the tape ran thin. I longed to find that magic in something again. And I truely found it in this book. Upon taking my purchase home, I learned there was another book done by Mr Froud. There was no question, I knew I had to have it. Since then, I have purchased the first Faerie book, and the Faerie Oracle and I can truely say that it has given me something that I belive I was always searching for. What these books has given me is something that I wish to share with everyone. Buy this book, it will open your vision to a whole new world.
B0000507R0|5.0|I listened to the hi-res surround sound mix and then switched to Dolby Digital and then Dolby Prologic - just to compare the various versions.    The Prologic version was apparently a derived downmixed dolby digital version.<br />The dvd-audio hi-res surround mix is unlike anything I have ever heard anywhere.    My jaw dropped to the floor. I could feel the music in my chest - without using a sub-woofer.   The drum beats were ultra crip and life like.    And the mix was ultra creative - instruments popped in and out - sounds swirled around the room.<br />Very effective - and not at all gimmicky.<br />If you don't have a dvd-audio player - take a look at your reciever - make sure it has a 6 wire 5.1 analog input - and then go buy a DVD-audio player.    You won't believe your ears !<br />And I'm not even a big ELP fan !!!!

B000003TAR|1.0|I'm 14 (using my mom's account) and this cd was dumb! maybe if i was high i would like it more but i didn't like it very much. I'll stick to Linkin Park and Papa Roach! And yes i do own this cd. (Nirvana-In Utero) I might b the only one puttin it down but when u get this cd u will put it down unless tha is ur a druggy cause it's mainly tha kind of music.....Hope you like my review. 100% true. Lata.............I'm out
B00003CWL6|1.0|This is the kind of film that Europeans love about America: it has every single ridiculous stereotype about suburban life, from hiding your true feelings from the neighbors to gun-totting nut cases who beat their children.<br />It was so bad that I was stunned at the attention it got.  Not a single scene or emotion rings true.  Is this, along with film versions of cartoons and old TV shows, the best that Hollywood can do?
6305744742|3.0|If you ignore the story of &quot;The Addams Family,&quot; then what you've got is a sumptuous recreation of one of the best television shows of all time. I, myself, have only seen a very few episodes of the original television series, but even that is enough to be able to realize that the movie captures beautifully the characters of the show, both in appearance and mannerisms. The overall appearance and atmosphere in which the family lives is well-rendered as well. The story does leave something to be desired, but the movie makes up for that with everything else. <br />The Addams' find themselves cast into a web of despair when Gomez's long-lost brother, Fester, returns after believed to be lost to the Bermuda Triangle. He carries his surrogate mother, Dr. Pinder Schloss, along for the ride, but there is more to them than meets the eye: they are planning to take over the mansion and raid the treasure hidden within the house. Fester begins to find himself drawn to the extremely unconventional lifestyle the family leads, but the stress put upon him by Pinder Schloss to carry out his original objective causes discord among the family, as well as raised suspicions in Morticia, the lady of the house, and young daughter Wednesday.<br />Everyone knows the Addams family are unlike anyone on this earth, finding delight in the darker sides of life. The movie comically plays out these rather dangerous sides of life, adding comments of sarcasm to events and occurrences which would otherwise prove too risqué for an audience. At one point, Morticia discovers a vile of cyanide in Fester's suitcase, turns to him and says, &quot;Fester, as if we'd run out.&quot; For some reason, this subtle humor seems to soften the impact of such circumstances, while adding a flare of wit and humor to the dialogue. <br />The cast seems to have been destined for their roles, flawlessly recapturing the essence of each character. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston take on the roles of Gomez and Morticia,the mother and father of the clan who cannot seem to keep their hands off one another. Julia's swarthy looks, along with his slick hair and pencil moustache, make him the perfect casting choice, while Huston captures the subtlety and calm pace of her character, who knows more than she admits. Christina Ricci and Jimmy Workman play the children, Wednesday and Pugsley, Ricci's dark demeanor and meek voice adding to the creepiness of her character, while Workman's pudgy stance and naivety makes his character convincing. Fester is played by Christopher Lloyd, in a role he was born to play. His bald head and corpse-like appearance fit his name to a T. <br />The story for the movie is a bit trying at times, slipping into periods of boredom. But ignoring this fault, it does give way to a lot of one-liners and moments of sheer comedic delight. At one point, the family is forced to move out and settle into the real world: Morticia goes out looking for a job as a daycare teacher, while Wednesday and Pugsley open up a lemonade stand. This contrast provides some of the movie's funniest dialogue: a Girl Scout offers to buy a glass of lemonade (&quot;Is this juice made from real lemons?&quot;) in return for their purchase of a box of Girl Scout cookies, to which Wednesday replies, &quot;Are they made from real Girl Scouts?&quot; <br />The house is also an important piece in the film, practically a character itself. The production design team gives the house a dark and moldy appearance, with peeling walls and dead vegetation surrounding the estate. There is an equally disturbing graveyard whose tombstones reflect the noises of their inhabitants when passed by. Still, there is a certain degree of elegance to the decay, as well as a maze of sheer funhouse madness once Fester finds his way to the vault housing the treasure. <br />In short, &quot;The Addams Family&quot; lacks an intriguing story, and one could go so far as to say that the story merely serves as an outlet for the jokes and gags. Still, there's no denying that it's a funny film, with a lot of good elements working for it. The cast brings the characters to life in a fresh and inviting way, while the sets are a whirlwind of hilarity and bewilderment. I was able to put aside my inhibitions and just enjoy the laughs, which makes the movie good enough for me.
6305363668|2.0|Hey, you figure a director's cut, man it's going to be good.  I mean the original version was one of the best sci-fi flicks I'd ever seen.  This version was definately NOT needed.  Too many nuances that there was just no way you are going to pick up were omitted when the voice overs were cut, that is unless you were a mind reader.  The ending is so radically different, I was left wondering what Scott had in mind with this.  My original version was on laserdisk and was stolen 2 years ago and since than, I haven't been able to replace it.  Damn.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I was eagerly awaiting this CD, as the trailer's lush use of visual led me to believe the audio would also be lush.  It IS. Hindi Diamond remix is a whole mess of fun.  As with many trailers, the songs are often not included in the film or the soundtrack.  You will NOT be disappointed.  I did hear that Ozzy Osborne did a song for the movie that does not appear in the soundtrack, but that's okay.  The rest of songs match the breathtaking vision of the film.  Buy the CD, it is well worth the money.
6305165912|5.0|I'm not very easy with my judgement on movies...But movies just don't get any better than this.  The first time I saw this movie I thought it was alright...But it was the second viewing that caught me, hook, line and sinker.  It is a very deep movie that works on many levels, what the hell that means I have no idea.  But I do know I pick something different up everytime I watch it.  It would have been cool to have the Cohen Brothers do commentary along with the movie(maybe someday).  The performances by everyone in this movie a Class-A. Watch this movie at least twice before you make a judgement.
B00004VW5A|5.0|This box set represents why Elvis Presley was the king of rock 'n' roll, with all of the master recording from the '50s (and a number of alternate and rare ones, too) here on these five discs, from his &quot;Sun Records&quot; days up to when he was inducted in the army in '58. <br />It might seem like a lot for the casual fan, but if you want to go beyond his greatest hits and don't mind spending some extra money, then, by all means, GET IT! It's well worth it!
B00000AFWZ|5.0|This is easily the finest collection of psychedelic music ever put together and perhaps the best box set ever. Culled from the original Nuggets released in 1972, this collection has been greatly expanded. It is short on hits and long on obscure garage bands whose music might have been lost forever if it hadn't been for this set. Every kid wanted to play guitar and be a rock star at that time.  It gives us an incredible insight into this era and the music that helped shape it. As usual the sound is first rate as we have come to expect from Rhino who continues to do all it can to preserve our musical heritage on it's label. This is truly a landmark collection.
B000001FTD|5.0|This album is awesome, it is just as good as Master of Puppets. Dan and Scott are amazing guitarists. Scott has mastered the mosh riff, in my opinion, he invented it.<br /> Everyone in the band is really talented. Stand out tracks: One World, I Am The Law, Indians, Among the Living. Buy this album, it's worth your money.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Ewan &amp; Nicole - who knew they had it in them?? This is another Baz Luhrmann classic compilation - ecclectic, daring and dazzling. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is truly a musical - but with no original songs, simply modern tracks sung by the stars, though often a little altered. Ewan and Nicole do quite well, as do the other performers like Bowie, Bono and Beck (who do have some original compositions). The &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; is truly a marvel, with Nicole and Ewan having a conversation where they just go from one song verse to another - including &quot;All You Need is Love&quot;, &quot;Pride (in the name of love)and &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; The track &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot; is also entrancing. There are actually 15 tracks - two versions of Bowie's &quot;Nature Boy&quot; frame the CD (and the trakcs listed here are not in the exact order...)I was looking forward to this CD - mostly out of curious anticipation, and I was not disappointed!
0451169514|5.0|The first King novel I ever read, and still my favorite. Pain-staking descriptions and characterizations, a heavy Lovecraft influence, and a terrific story of childhood friendships and terrors make this epic the epitome of monster tales. The ending does feel a bit short and weak when put in the perspective of the sprawling horror of the rest of the book, but it is forgivable in light of the carefully crafted storytelling preceding it. As a recommendation: if you liked Its kind of cosmic evil and want to see more, W.H. Hodgeson (&quot;The House on the Borderlands&quot;) and H.P. Lovecraft (&quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; and &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;) are your best bets.
6302293553|5.0|a true classic of bizarre and unpredictable British humor.  What manner of demented minds thought up things like the knights who (until recently) said &quot;Ni!,&quot; the rude Frenchman who taunts Arthur with such barbs as &quot;Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberry!,&quot; the large wooden rabbit, and the scintillating logic of the witch trial scene (&quot;If she weighs the same as a duck, then she's made of wood, and therefore....A WITCH!&quot;).  <br />This is one of those flicks that just gets better each time you watch it.  I rate it the best of the Python feature movies.
B00005B6C9|4.0|As a long time Bee Gees fan who owns most everything they've written, I must say that this is another strong piece of work by Barry, Maurice, and Robin.  Barry's voice is definitely not what it used to be but the songs make up for it and Robin and Maurice still sound strong.<br />&quot;Wedding Day&quot;, although a tad hokey, might be the best song on the CD.  It's fantastically written, flows beautifully, and Barry and especially Robin sound great!   &quot;Walking on Air&quot; and &quot;Embrace&quot; are also outstanding.  The only songs I'm not a big fan of are Voice in the Wilderness and Technicolor Dreams.  The former is just not made for Barry to sing and the latter just isn't my style.  <br />Nevertheless, the best songwriters ever (in my opinion) still shine on this CD.  Pick it up!
B00004XONN|5.0|before buying this cd i have to admit i was a bit skeptical. i knew a lot was expected out of radiohead as a result of ok computer, and i was afraid that like many other bands radiohead will take a slow plunge after a genius cd, recycling old material. well my fears were wrong as hell. this cd makes me love radiohead even more.<br />with totally different music than ok computer, radiohead still make me feel incredible. this record is filled with electronic  sounds, which add up with tom yorks voice to a masterpiece cd. surrealistic, moody, psychedelic, makes me know that I do have some serious mental/social issues and im not the only one with them.
B00003CWN3|5.0|A haunting, touching film. Superb acting by Chloe Severgny (sp.) and Hillary Swank. Very convincing love story. (Which I think this movie is.) Stunning.
B000002UJQ|5.0|i first bought this cd 5 years ago when i was in 9'th grade, only because i remembered i liked their earlier street spirit song. god was i a lucky .... i didnt realize it first, but the more i listen to it and the more i grow up im sure that this music is genius art, music at its best, and ever so relevant to my life. lyrics, chords, mellodies, perfect.<br />only a year or so after i bought the cd i started reading on the press and everywhere how everyone believes this cd is brilliant, and it started winning all kinds of awards. WHO cares?  ITS MY CD AND I LOVE IT.
B000000H6D|5.0|This was the second T.O.N. cd i got, and boy it was great, i love every trac on the album, Black#1, scary goth chics, cant lose you, about love to a woman or even God,Blood and Fire and too late frozen,wonderful songs abt. players, SummerBreeze, being thankful for what u have in life, set me on fire, abt a hot girl,Bloody Kisses a song abt a girl who killed herself and the pain in it, it also describes the kiss of Judas from the bible when he betrayed Christ, thats what they meant by it,Suspended in Dusk abt. a vampire who wants to turn good as a follower in Christ or wants forgiveness.Someone needs to make a movie abt it. Then Christian Woman, ok people dont get offended by this song, he is talking abt. Mary Magnolin,also like a woman who did something wrong too sexual like from the video anyway, parts of it show mary when Christ is laying on the ground, but wants real love, u have to have it spiritual by God, not physically.

Stay Negative!!!
B00005AXEL|5.0|The Witchy Woman who first twirled her way, scarf-ensconced, to center stage as the smoky vocals behind Fleetwood Mac, has once again proven why she is an American Rock Icon with her latest album, Trouble In Shangri-La.  In her first solo attempt since 1994's Street Angel, Nicks has been busy brewing this album for some time now. She has been constantly writing songs and lyrics into her journal, and waiting to go into the studio when the time was right.  It was well worth the wait.  <br />After recently completing a Fleetwood Mac reunion tour, she took to the studio armed with a diary of songs and a musical entourage with the likes of Sheryl Crow, Macy Gray, and Sarah McLachlan.  The product is the unquestionably hypnotizing and varied new project from Ms. Nicks, which is sure to please old-time Stevie fans, as well as new listeners hearing her on the radio for the first time. <br />The best songs on the album are, unsurprisingly, those penned by Nicks herself.  No one has been able to pinpoint Nicks' vocal strengths as well as she has.  She is a true writer-singer, and sounds most at ease with her own pieces.  The title track, and opener of the album, gives us an immediate healthy dose of this straight away.  Written and produced by Nicks, and with the vocal backing of longtime Stevie-chanteuses Sharon Celani and Lori Nicks, \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\" is a song with ethereal vocal layering and precise instrumentation.  <br />Likewise, the mesmerizing track \\"Planets of the Universe\\" is as otherworldly as its title suggests.  This track will please the die-hard Fleetwood Mac fans, who still hear echoes of Stevie's heart-wrenching vocals on hits like the insatiable \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Silver Springs.\\"  In the latter, Nicks proclaimed in the song's ending, \\"I follow you down 'till the sound / Of my voice will haunt you / You'll never get away from the sound / Of the woman who loves you.\\"  In \\"Planets,\\" Nicks promises that same endless torture, acting again as an uncompromising predictor, \\"You will never love again / The way you love me / You will never rule again / The way you ruled me / You will never change again / The way you're changing.\\"<br />While the true-blue Nicks songs are brilliant, this album is undeniably a joint effort.  Stevie's collaboration shines through in this album, and helps to give each track a unique vibe.  <br />Her duet with larger-than-life Macy Gray is particularly noteworthy.  How is it possible for Stevie to find a duettist with as much sassy scratch as she has?  Well, she did, with Miss Gray.  The two croon together in a surprisingly soothing blend on the exotic track, \\"Bombay Sapphires.\\"  Stevie said of Gray in a press release, \\"She's like a walking tornado.  She's a total blast.  We had a great time working on the song.\\"  <br />A surprise-hit on the album is Nicks' work with Dixie Chick Natalie Maines.  While their joint effort could have produced a lackluster country song, they instead created a country-injected rock tune, \\"Too Far From Texas,\\" featuring a potent harmony of the two songstresses.<br />Most remarkable of the collaborations, however, is Stevie's partnership with Sheryl Crow.  While Crow's two songs written for Stevie remain some of the album's weakest, it is her work on production and concept that helped make the album a cohesive and expressive effort.  Nicks has said of Crow, \\"Our connection is deep... deeper than I can even put into mere words,\\" and Crow has returned the sentiment, stating, \\"To even be in the same room with Stevie was a dream come true for me.  To work with her was beyond description.  It was extraordinary.\\"  Their mutual admiration helped to form the album's overall structure and consistency.<br />While Crow did her share of production, a large amount was in the hands of John Shanks, who also wrote one of the album's catchiest hits, the radio-happy \\"Every Day.\\"<br />Appropriately, Nicks ends her album with the contemplative and wistful song, \\"Love Is.\\"  Detailed with apotpourri of instrumentation and vocal backing from Sarah McLachlan, it serves not only as the album's most expressive piece, but also as a reminder that you've been reading pages torn from the diary of a quiet artist.<br />In a time where very few artists write the music they perform, it is a gem when someone does it and does it well.  With Shangri-La, Stevie Nicks has taken a comfortable seat in a throne of legendry.  Since the early 1970's, Stevie has compelled us with her evocative vocal prowess and songwriting, and we can only be a captive audience, and hope that she continues to share with her talents with us.
B00003CXE6|5.0|This was a great movie. It was sad, and intense, exactly the kind of movie I like. Russel Crowe has been dissed for his acting, but my most humble opinion is that he did a good job. The movie is one of the best I have ever see. It is worth all of the money, you will spend on it. And don't worry that it's not historically accurate, it entertains :) and that is exactly what it is meant to do. Oh yeah, and if you are over emotional like Me, you will probably cry through the last twenty minutes!  The ending is fitting however.  One cannot acheieve much more than the status of a hero.
B00005K3LW|5.0|Out of all of Bruce Willis's movies the Die Hard series is the best and out of the Die Hard  series the Die Hard With a Vengeance is the best. Out of all it has the best acting, the best action, and the best plote that keeps you in your seet. Its explosive and funny with a twist. This is a must buy movie.
B0000507PC|4.0|There are some movies that are so good, you can only watch them once. This is one such movie. I loved it. It makes you think about abortion and several other issues. I was kind of jaded by the ended though....<br />The only bad thing in this movie, is the inevitable 10 mintue long scene where you can either fast forward or stare at the naked butt of Charlize theron, so I only gave it 4 stars.
6303022901|4.0|As I watched \\"Joy Luck Club\\" for a third time, it occurred to me to wonder... we see the three other ladies explaining some aspect of their life stories to their daughters (or having it explained posthumously), but there is no such scene for Ying Ying. I have since found that this omission was deliberate. Author Amy Tan was very much in control of this film, and she made the decision to cut France Nuyen's best scene, in which she reveals the tragedy of her son's death to her daughter. Nuyen is extremely bitter about this. Apparently Tan wanted only unknowns in the film and was worried that Nuyen's presence might take away from the others. I would like to see a Director's Cut with that scene reinstated.
B00003CX8U|5.0|The best autobriographical musicals ever.... complex, funny, black humor, great dancing, self-analysis, etc.  Terrific. Underrated from day one.
0316777722|5.0|As with almost everything Sedaris writes, each of the autobiographical stories in One Day Me Talk Pretty will cause you to laugh out loud, but one story in particular will cause you to go from laughter to tears.  &quot;The Youth in Asia&quot; is one of the most touching stories I have read in years. Sedaris writes about his family's pets -- how attached they got to them, how they treated them like humans and how sad they were to see them go.  Sedaris uses delightful descriptions of the cats and dogs who shared his family life to capture the subject matter perfectly. As I began reading this story, enjoying Sedaris' usual humor, I was not prepared for how this story would affect me for some time after I read it. I highly recommend this book. Read &quot;The Youth in Asia&quot; first!
6305169187|5.0|I don't see why everybody thought ARMAGEDDON was so bad...I thought it was oustanding! I'll admit: I've seen both DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON and I have to say both of them are great and unique (I just can't decide between the two!). Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, and Liv Tyler are all excellent with their roles. So is the rest of the cast. The visual and sound effects were pretty good, too. And even the storyline and plot wasn't as bad as a lot of people thought it was. Michael Bay did a wonderful job directing this film (which was probably a hard film to direct) and the cast and crew of this film should be given more credit because this film really is excellent whether you like these kind of movies or not. And sure, it may seem pretty predictable...but you'll still love it! Besides, it wasn't really meant to be an Oscar-winning film. It's just a fun, &quot;popcorn&quot; type film. I'm glad that I saw it and you should all give it a chance! I can gaurentee you'll love it.
B00004Z459|5.0|.... The cover art is creative and unique, and may be the highlight of the album although all 12 tracks are great.... Although it is rap-rock (which isconsidered a felony among many rock followers), it is too incredible to be overlooked.<br />Unlike my other reviews, this will not include a song-by-song review. There are simply too many good points on this album to fit those and that in just 1000 words. The guitar riffs are more than noise, the two lead vocalists provide an excellent sound (although this would make the band rather large with a bass player: consider it nothing short of a miracle that they pulled this work of art off with bass players on song-to-song contracts), and the DJ is amazing. The DJ actually has some influence in his songs, unlike DJ ..... Just listen to track 4, &quot;Points of Authority.&quot; He also has his own track to showcase his talents, entitled &quot;Cure For The Itch,&quot; which for being nothing short of scratching with quiet instrumental, is one heck of a track.<br />Everything is great on this album, but there are a few tracks that stand out. Tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10 stand out---wait, that's almost every track! One tiny complaint on the trackorder---&quot;Forgotten&quot; and &quot;Crawling&quot; should have been switched to make it a fast section and a slow section. Track 1 &quot;Papercut&quot; is a great way to bring you right into the album with the intro, and Track 2 is of course the great single &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, which I'm still not sick of yet. &quot;With You&quot; shows off the rapping skills, while &quot;Points of Authority&quot; is more of a singing track and the DJ's big one on this album---it's my favorite on the CD. Then you get into slower more reflective songs, and &quot;Crawling&quot;, track 5, is certainly the standout among those. &quot;Forgotten,&quot; track 10, brings you right into the song, which is a good thing. I also love the piano intro and outro on Track 8, &quot;Untitled (In The End),&quot; which is a great slow and mystical song.<br />Overall, this is a great album that I recommend you buy---now that they have a permanent bass player, their next album will be even better. You are witnessing the future of rap-rock with this album and it is well worth your money, as previously mentioned. Buy this for some actual great-quality rap-rock.
6305363668|5.0|I Love the movie &quot;Blade Runner&quot; because it's one of my favorite all time movies.  I liked the Director's Cut better because it's more superior than the original theatrical release. I liked the fact that the Director's Cut of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; has removed the voiceovers and the &quot;uplifting&quot; finale. I already miss the voiceovers and the ending from the original version. This is one of Ridley Scott's best movies.  The Director's Cut is in Widescreen format and I recommend it very much, especially for those who like Widescreen films.

B00003IQQA|5.0|I had listened to Human Clay and I loved it!  I had wanted to buy this cd for so long, and finally I saw it in a store.  I live in Kenya so the CD stores here don't get many good CD's.  At first, I didn't realize that it had a bonus track on it, I just wanted Human Clay.  Luckily, neither did anyone at the store.  They were selling it for the same price that they would have sold the normal version for.  I didn't know that it was a bonus track until very recently.  I had wondered why I didn't remember the song &quot;Young Grow Old&quot; from the other times that I listened to Human Clay.  This song is up with &quot;What If&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, and &quot;Higher&quot; as one of my favorites.  It is well worth the extra money.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|When 1996's 'Tidal' came out, it was clear that its' young vocalist was no flash in the pan. Despite an overall sense of gloominess and woe-is-me, Apple's debut was regarded as exceptionally stunning, drawing accolades for its' unmissable single 'Criminal' and the magical 'Sleep to dream'. It was thus no surprise that people anticipated her follow up album with sky-high expectations of it. In 1999, Apple unveiled her second album, the curiously titled 'When the pawn hits the conflicts...'. The full title actually works out to a mini-poem of sorts, and one that makes... sense upon repeated reading. ...Rarely have there been albums where every single song is an unrivalled gem, but this is one of them (non-believers, you'd have to actually buy this CD to know what I'm talking about). Now, both sides of the Atlantic have sung their praises of this album, and I still can't get enough of it, despite listening to the album in its entirety over - literally - more than a hundred times.<br />The opener, 'On the Bound' is a contradictory anthem of deep longing - despite the fierce independent tone of the title, we find Fiona wailing 'You're all I need' with a passion quite unseen since Sinead O'Connor's classic howls on 'Mandinka'. The second track 'To your love' is a grand ode to love, with the songstress apologising for her seeming indifference - 'Please forgive me for my distance' she whispers. This particular track is very effective, and frankly, its almost bewildering how Apple hasn't got the recognition and album sales that she so obviously deserves. Honestly, don't people know how to appreciate good music anymore? As if to reaffirm my bewilderment, the third, and perhaps most gutsy track on the album, simply floors you. &quot;Limp&quot; which was an official single release from the CD early in 2000 works on all levels - musically, instrumentally, and lyrically. Gripping stuff.<br />&quot;Paper Bag&quot; and &quot;Love Ridden&quot; are in the same vein as many of the songs on 'Tidal', though the production values and lyrics are far better. Its apparent that Apple has evolved tremendously as a singer and songwriter, and 'A Mistake', another of the album's I'm-gonna-be-me-and-no-one-else tracks is highly reflective of this fact. One thing thats true of 'When the Pawn' is that it keeps reaffirming the Angry Young Woman image more so than 'Tidal' and the listener can get weary of this after a point. At places, its Apple's stunning talents as a writer that retain your interest in the song and not the music (like 'Fast as You can' - perhaps the most commercial of all the songs on this CD), but in most others, its a combination of innovative music and sheer lyrical poetry that keep you hooked. The final songs on the album are 'Get Gone' and 'I know' - both sung about a lover who could have done better, and these are among the slower paced, deeper tracks on the set. Not that I'm complaining. Fiona has proved time and again that shes a true master of the Love Ballad, and what better time to show off this skill?<br />'When the Pawn' is an album that you come out of feeling light-headed and enriched - something I haven't felt since Tori Amos' 'Under the Pink'. On second thought, that particular album actually left me with a headache, but it broke new ground, which is something that Fiona has done here. What affected me most about this set is that it gets you in a way no other collection of songs has done through the last year. I've listened to Eminem, played my old Rolling Stones records again, and yes, even downloaded Spear's 'Oops...I did it again', but I haven't ever faced an album with such repeat value. I couldn't possibly recommend this album strongly enough, so all I'll say is : You'd better buy it to believe it. Its an absolute must-have.gs on 'Tidal', though the production values and lyrics are far better.

0812589041|4.0|Ender's Game is about a six-year old boy who is put through harsh trianing to become a general for the world.  The world has been in a hundred year war with the buggers.  The government controls how many kids a family can have.  The childern are also monitored by the government from when they are born to when they are about six years old.  Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin has had his monitor in longer than both his sister and brother.  This makes his brother jealous and he is very mean to Ender.  The government takes Ender from his family and takes him to a space station where he begins his training to become a general.  The government has a fleet of starships going to the buggers home planet and when they get there they need someone to lead them to a victory.  Ender learns about the previous wars and is trained in simulated battles.  The instructors of the school pushes him to the max.  He becomes a genreal for the simulated wars at a very young age.  As the training gets harder every day he becomes isolated from the world and his friends at the school.  He finds him self fighting battles on a screen, but soon finds that he his really controling the fleet that is fighting the buggers.  Ender does not know how long he can take this punishment for and he will soon find that it is almost over. This book was very inspiring.  The harsh training that Ender goes through is really amazing.  The author gives great detail and imagery.  The author really gets into Ender's thoughts and this can be disturbing and inspiring at the same time.  This book is a great book for anyone who wants to go into another world.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|It is rare when an album comes out of the blue and blinds you with its' beauty. The only ones I can think of are 'The Broadway Album' by Barbra Streisand, and 'Selmasongs' by Bjork. However, the sheer brilliance of 'Moulin Rouge' puts those two in the shade. As a collaborative effort, its better than anything put out in the last ten years. And thats no small achievment. As a musical piece, it soars way above anything on the airwaves right now, and evokes Sondheim, Hammerstein, and even Dvorak. <br />I must admit that I am not too fond of soundtracks, and am extremely suspicious of anything that is marketed widely. The current commercialization of 'Moulin Rouge' put me off the film at first, and I wasn't expecting anything of the soundtrack, but one listen was all it took to show me that here was an album that was an instant classic. Each song is a gem, and by the end of it, you'd probably hold the CD in your hands and acknowledge that its one of the best things you ever bought.<br />Yes, THAT good.<br />The most sparkling compositions here are sung by Nicole Kidman, who at once makes her impression as a singer to contend with. Vastly better than any of the current crop of singers ruling the charts, Nicole's breathy vocals are the best female renditions I have heard all of this year (if you're still going ga-ga over Nelly Furtado and Dido, get over them. Nicole is where its at). Her 'One day I'll fly away' is better than anything Dido, Sarah Mclachlan and Jewel have put out combined. Again, yes, THAT good.<br />I expect 'Moulin Rouge' to land Nicole a recording contract - it would be criminal to let a singer of such depth and beauty pass us by. The same can also be said of Ewan McGregor, though we all knew that he could sing. His vocals in 'Velvet Goldmine' were pretty good, and he is best remembered for his 'Somewhere' from 'A Life Less Ordinary' (they cut his version off the soundtrack). But on this CD, Ewan proves that hes grown as a singer, evoking Marc Cohn, Joshua Kadison, and even Bruce Springsteen. I always thought movie-stars who attempted singing were kidding themselves and their audience, but believe me, Ewan and Nicole are true talents.<br />If I were to compare the songs sung by Nicole and Ewan to anything previously released, then I would have to choose 'The Phantom of the Opera'. Nicole's musical numbers are wonderfully based on Andrew Lloyd Webber's work, and she really shines. <br />The other monumental songs on this landmark CD, are by Bono, Fatboy Slim and Beck (his 'Diamond Dogs' bring back memories of 'Odelay'), giving 'Moulin Rouge' a feel and look that hasn't quite been captured by anyone else out there, ever. The only blemish, if I may say so, is the inclusion of Christina and gang's 'Lady Marmalade'. Even so, the soundtrack is a wonder, and an essential addition to your music collection. <br />This could well end up being the best soundtrack this year, or dare I say it, the best album of the year. Whether you're into trance, hip-hop, or Broadway musicals, 'Moulin Rouge' delivers on all counts. A masterpiece of the finest order.

B000058T5J|3.0|I bought this album after being blown away by Bitches Brew.  It was recorded live, as the title states only a little later than when Miles was working on Bitches Brew.  There are some truly evil tracks on this album.  &quot;What I say&quot; has one of the most funky, energetic beats I've ever heard &quot;Funky Tonk&quot; is also quite good.  However, I will make the same criticism so many people make about Miles' electric period, by using so many musicians, many of whom are not jazz musicians, the music gets a little crowded. Too many cooks spoils the broth. However, you can't find fault with Miles playing, in fact, his runs on top of these crazy, funky beats are the best part of the album. But I feel that at times this album asks too much of the listener.  The drum solo on &quot;What I say&quot; is way, way too long and many of the solos do not match the beats at all.  If you're just getting into Miles' fusion days, you're probably better off buying Bitches Brew. This is more an album for the hard core fan. Still, you can't fault the man for trying and I'm sure that the music was much cooler at the shows than on the CD.
B00002DE2L|5.0|This is the ultimate Four Seasons album.  While other reviewers have dubbed this disc an &quot;alternative interpretation,&quot; I have to dissagree.  The way Anne Sophie-Mutter and the Trondheim Soloists bring the music to life is surely the way Vivaldi intended it to be.  Fair warning, however: this is firey and sexy to the extreme, so be prepared to fall in love with Anne.
B00003CXMG|5.0|After the touching tale of Jerry McGuire, Crowe comes back to write what could be interpreted as a type of self-biographical piece.  As a young kid growing up, Crowe was also a rock journalist, and he acturately portrays the triumphs and downfalls of the profession in this movie.      Crudup and Jason Lee are truly the best two performers in the movie.  Lee gives an outstanding performance as the lead singer of the band Feverdog, and Crudup is a kid who the audience feels for the entire movie.  Crowe's all star cast make him ALMOST FAMOUS among the great directors of his time.  If you like rock music, journalism, or a story about a mid-level band learning what it takes to stay together through the media, ALMOST FAMOUS is definitely a movie you need to check out.

B00000K2SE|5.0|I'd read and heard a lot about it and since I'm not fond popular films, I wasn't interested.  A friend insisted I watch it and after doing so, I was hooked.  It's an interesting look at modern life today, structured and soulless, and the possibility of going beyond.  Totally fell for the standard messianic theme, as well as the notion of the phoenix.  Perfectly fitting that the villain is basically a bureaucrat.  Highly recommended.  Excuse me while I unplug myself...
B00003CXQY|3.0|For some unknown reason, people love giving reviews based on the movie in the theatre's and not the DVD.  I give this move 3 stars because the dvd is so subpar. The movie is wonderful, don't get me wrong, but the video transfer is absolutely (or damn close anyways) horrible.  Pixalation, shoddy picture shots..Disney must have no idea how to make dvd's or something.  The extras disk was pretty interesting, but I'm not exactly sure it adds up to $10 extra.  It probably goes $5 for the case, $5 for the extra dvd.  Overall, I'll go ahead and reccommend the one dvd set but if you have money to waste, go for it.  Even then, the one dvd set should be $17.  Disney needs a slap on the hand for butchering the video of this great film.

0790729628|5.0|I first heard about this movie in 1999, I rented it and I loved it, then I bought it (at +$.., I feel so stupid for paying so much). I love this movie, the story is great, it has a moody dark atmosphere, the acting is great, the music, everything is very, very good. I started looking for it's gross and for it's awards and nominations, the movie bombed and it was the only nomination it received at the Oscars was like special effects, AND DIDN'T WON! Yes, it wasn't the director's cut, but it was still powerful, I kind of liked Mr.Ford's voice-over, it explained about the combination of street languages, at the end.....SPOILER.....when Roy Batty dies he talks about existence, how much time we have to live, etc. They should have left some parts of the voice-over and cut the rest. I also disliked now with the director's cut that Deckard isn't human, the audience must have someone to identify with, and he was it. This movie should have been at least nominated for best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay and even a supporting actor nomination for Ruther H.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|absolutely brilliant! <br /> I think this is the best soundtrack that I've heard in a while. Even though we've all heard most of these songs they are reinvented in a fantastic new way. I love the orginals as much as anyone but it is done so classly that you forgive that they are all covers. Forget having credible songs these range from touching to downright fun but have all been done before. Don't try to sing along and expect every note to be the same though...Realize they are great songs that aren't suppose to be like the orginal too much. <br />The weakest part of the album would have to be the two version of Nature Boy (which is okay). Or getting over having to listen to &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; so many...times without the radio's help.  <br />Beware: If you buy this cd you may feel you have to see Moulin Rouge.
B00000F169|4.0|This is just about the only Hollywood film to recognize the fact that interstellar communication is limited to the speed of light, that artificial personalities may be less than cheerfully subservient, and that deep space exploration may not neccessarily attract the best and the brightest of the human race.  Naturally, this is not a movie for everyone.  It's very much like a film-school film, but like one made by a couple of VERY talented students.  It features a lot of dialogue that wavers between comedy and ironic philosophy, and never really settles on either end of the spectrum.  A couple of the scenes involving the beachball - er, alien - were later worked into Alien and Aliens, some of the computer graphics were used in Star Wars, and the overeager and intelligent bomb concept forms a major theme in the entire  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series.  I love it.  But when I say it's not for everyone, I mean it.  This is a film to watch with a bunch of serious science fiction lovers (and I'm not talking about Star Wars fans), or alone.  You were warned.
044022165X|4.0|The Rainmaker tells the story of Rudy Baylor, a poor law student, who is optimistic about his life. Then his possibility of getting a job disappears, he is forced to declare bankruptcy, and his girlfriend leaves him for a wealthy student. Grisham's sixth novel is much different than the first five. He tries out telling the story in the first person, a difficult thing to do, and pulls it off pretty well. The character of Rudy is a good accomplishment, but the ambulance-chasing Deck left a powerful impression, as did the dying Donny Ray. This is fine reading, but there are a couple of problems as I see it. First, there is absolutely no doubt that the jury will find for Rudy. The courtroom scenes, while humorous, were not quite as compelling as I had hoped. Second, Grisham breaks Mark Twain's rule about writing, &quot;Don't say the fat lady screamed. Bring her out and let her scream.&quot; This has always been a factor in his writing, but it seems more blatant here because it happens in courtroom scenes. I didn't like this. I also thought the ending was a bit of a disappointment. Overall, though, it was a fine book.
B00005ATQM|5.0|I'm a huge Metallica fan and listening to this DVD was like hearing it for the first time.  The sound is incredible.  I was pretty much swallowed by all the instruments coming from all over the place.  I definetly recommend this to any Metallica fan.  You must have a complete surround sound system including a subwoofer to get the whole effect.  I think DVD-Audio is going to be the next great thing.  I can't wait until more releases!!<br />Carlos
0679721037|3.0|This book held a very strong message. In telling of the lives of six people that survived the bomb, we learn not only their stories, but we also feel a bit of the enormity of the disaster the bomb at Hiroshima caused. We learn that the effects of the atomic bomb didn't end a few days after it was dropped. It ended the lives of many, and changed those of all the citizens of Hiroshima.<br />The fact is, however, that the book was very boring and confusing. It is necesary to read a chapter two or three times to take in everthing that happened. If you are willing overcome that aspect of the novel, then you should buy this novel without delay. I wasn't able to do so. That's why I gave it three stars.
B00001NFCY|2.0|There tends to be a correlation between bands becoming extremely popular and the quality of their music.  This, unfortunately, held true for Creed.<br />The most obvious problem with the CD is that all of the songs sound the same, unlike My Own Prison, which had a variety of styles.<br />Basically, if you were a die-hard fan of My Own Prison, I don't think that you would find Human Clay to be a worthy purchase.
B000028U0Y|3.0|The highlights of this LP--&quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; and &quot;Jackson,&quot; in particular--are so great that they nearly make up for they corny ballads in between.  Nearly.<br />A few more performances by June Carter, who growls like a bear on &quot;Jackson,&quot; and a little less dependence on sappy tear-jerkers from the Man In Black, and this would be a more listenable LP
0790729628|5.0|I cannot belive the number of people saying the film is worse without the voice over and stupid moronic happy ending.  I don't want to insult people here but if you can't work out what is going on without the voice over then you really aren't paying attention.  The delicious ambiguity in the is he/isn't he a Rep still has me confused (even though Ridley Scott said he was).  Ford's acting is superb, you can tell what he is thibking just by reading his face.  Unless the theatrical release has all the extras that are criminally missing from this DVD DO NOT purchase it in preference to the ditrectors cut.  Scott knew what he was doing, Harrison knew what he was doing when he deliberatly managled the voice overs, everyone knew what they were doing apart from the studio execs.
B000001F76|4.0|...<br />Hank Williams, THE Hank Williams, was the greatest C&amp;W Star who ever lived, bar none.  And this is the album to grab, no matter what kind of music you think you like, if you want to hear a masterful songwriter and singer.  There's also another version &quot;20 Of Hank Williams' Greatest Hits,&quot; available on Mercury CD, but go for the 40 hits version.  Hank Williams never released a bad record, as far as I know, so the bigger the better.<br />He wrote and played in the idiom he knew, but Hank Williams was more than C&amp;W.  The band plays bluesy (country bluesy, at least), and he sings jazzy.  To me, Hank Williams wrote and sang American standards, absolute classics that will be sung 100 years from now.<br />My personal favorites are &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot; and &quot;Jambalaya,&quot; one imortalized in The Shawshank Redemption, the other a certifiable American classic.<br />Next time you're sitting in front of a blank TV screen, waiting to turn it on until 9:10 so you'll be sure to miss that sequined beer belly screeching &quot;Are You Ready For Some Football?!?&quot;, put on this record and enjoy some real music.<br />He was thE master.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|one of the best comedies made in the pasrt 10 years! no doubt. a really funny moviz. i liked iit alots! good acting. does anyone else thjink anne faris is hott? i do!! a real good moviez u should watch with ur firends.....word!
B000002LVB|3.0|My entre' into the coolest, and least succesful, band I was ever in was a 15-minute guitar solo I played on a spontanious version of &quot;Rock &amp; Roll.&quot;  We ended up playing nothing but Velvet Underground, Dylan and Clash covers.<br />We were terrible.  Really awful.<br />LOADED appears to have been an attempt by the Velvets to step out from under the mega-hype that had surrounded their first few records (some of that hype machine remains in place; according to the linear notes, LOADED is &quot;one of the greatest rock 'n roll albums ever recorded&quot;) and maybe get a hit.  No number ones here, although there are a couple minor classics. <br />I refuse to call any album produced as shabbily as this a great record.  If Lou Reed was half as tough as his dwindling number of supporters love to say he is, he would have taken whoever was responsible for the horrible drop-in acoustic guitar solo on &quot;Who Loves The Sun,&quot; and whoever allowed Reeds off-key vocal on &quot;Train Around The Bend,&quot; or whoever decided to put the lame backing vocals on &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; at the front of the mix, and he would have put those people in front of a firing squad.<br />This could have been a great LP, I suppose, but it's really just an interesting one.
B00002DEQQ|5.0|When Tom Jones did Prince's &quot;Kiss&quot; with Art of Noise some time in the late '80s or early '90s I really hoped that it wouldn't remain his only creative collaboration adventure with current rock or pop artists. Naturally I was thrilled when this one came out, and it is a great album indeed. From his version of &quot;Burning down the house&quot; to &quot;Mama told me not to come&quot; with the Stereophonics this album is filled with cool songs that pitch Tom Jones' unique voice against some very cool rearrangements of alternative rock tunes. If you are thinking that Jones can only croon the songs he was famous for 20 years ago, think again!
B000002KDG|5.0|I'm one of the lucky thousands who saw Neil Young on the tour where he recorded RUST NEVER SLEEPS and, never having been much of a fan of his prior to that, it was an eye-opener.<br />The first set, like the first side of this LP, was the acoustic Neil everyone knew.  But when amps began to hum and the lights came up for the second set, you knew you were about to experience something different.<br />Crazy Horse, the most under-rated live act in Rock history, roared--and I do mean ROARED--through the set.  Young's guitar was blazing, just shooting off those odd licks of his like little bolts of lightning.  <br />That concert is perfectly reflected on RUST NEVER SLEEPS.  These are some of Young's best songs, especially &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and &quot;Powderfinger.&quot;  And Crazy Horse is the thunder to Young's lightning.<br />I've never cared as much about the supposed social commentary so many critics see in this album as I do about his argument and his plea for artistic freedom.  Young was something of a moving target in the 1960s and early 1970s, doing acoustic and electric folk, folk-rock, and some protest music.  What I hear him saying on RUST NEVER SLEEPS is that an artist has to force his own growth, experiment and take chances, or he'll end up producing nothing or, worse yet, producing pablum (are you listening, Graham Nash?).  Since RUST NEVER SLEEPS, Young has made techno, rockabilly, country, heavy metal, and avante garde records.  Some have been great, some have been failed experiments.  But Young has been the most courageous and sincere artists of the era, and deserves the credit grunge rockers have given him.  He has remained true.<br />By the way--can we not call him a great American rock star?  He's Canadian.
B00003CXA6|5.0|The film is truely magnificent.Errors on the part of the South; no coverage or screening by the cavalry saved at the last minute by an actor.Lee's belief in his Armies ability to do anything, even in the face of ignorance of the enemies strength.            The North's Mead:no control over the selection of the battle site.  The music is truely great and the epic well chosen. As a history buff I can only thank the people who came together to make this film.
B00000IWVS|5.0|I am neither a pianist nor even a musician.  But when I listen to  Argerich's Polonaise in A Flat (Opus 53), it rivets me every time.  It's expressive, tempestuous, exhilarating.  When I listen to, for example, an Ashkenazy rendition, it comes off as merely pretty, and perhaps a little plangent.  The difference is that between a dark, mysterious woman with whom one falls madly in love, and Princess Diana.  I don't know which version more clearly reflects Chopin's &quot;intent.&quot;  If Chopin did not intend Argerich's interpretation, he should have.  This CD is worth buying just for  the Polonaise in A flat.
630460291X|1.0|Well, where to start? On a positive note, Kevin  Costner is a good actor and doesn't do too bad  a job at portraying Robin Hood (ALMOST making this film deserve two stars). That's it, as far as good points: THE MOVIE [stinks]! What has made me angry is that there are people (IDIOTS!) who consider this  abortion to be equal or better than the version with Flyn! After recently seeing the 1938 movie which yes is campy but still wonderful like THE WIZARD OF OZ, I felt committed to writing a review of this horrible picture which I sat through on HBO. <br />Morgan Freeman as a moor- why a moor character? Why him? Marion was not alluring like traditonally portrayed, okay but why make her such a [witch]? Was England even worth  fighting for in this film? It looked as depressing as the set of WATERWORLD, which may be a realistic picture of  the Middle Ages, but sad nonetheless; I will take romanticism anyday. Finally, maybe it isn't fair to compare this to the 1938 version. I saw a silent version with Douglas Fairbanks which wasn't so hot but comeon people- giving this such high a rating- DUMMIES!
0679720200|5.0|One could translate the original title of this book also as foreigner, which I think describes more or less all of us at one point or another in life. The language Camus uses in this book is simple, yet the book is only as simple as life...! I think often readers want to be able to completely identify or completely not-identify with the main character. Anything in-between is harder to deal with; this book is all the things in-between. It is a great book that I could recommend to those who in general like Sartre and Kafka.
1559409002|5.0|&quot;Carnival of Souls,&quot; the only theatrical film every directed by Herk Harvey, is a cult classic with a most deserved reputation that puts it on a par with dead George Romero's &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; in terms of shoestring productions.  Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) accepts a car ride from a group of other young girls, only to end up in a drag race that sees the car go over a bridge with only Mary surviving.  Having taken a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Mary heads for her new home, passing a deserted pavilion on the outskirts of town.  Mary is drawn to the ruined bathing center/carnival, but has bigger problems since she keeps seeing a leering, corpse-like man (played by Harvey) watching her.  Again and again Mary has the eerie of experience of suddenly finding herself in a silent world where no one seems to notice her.  Eventually she returns to the pavilions to understand her final fate.<br />&quot;Carnvial of Souls&quot; came about because Herk Harvey drove by Saltair, the deserted 1940s tourist resort outside Salt Lake City, and decided it would make a powerful location for a horror film.  Harvey recruited John Clifford to come up with a screenplay that would involve Harvey's image of dead bodies rising from the lake to pursue their victim.  The finished product certainly evokes a nightmarish quality that makes you ignore the technical problems with overdubbing, campy performances by the supporting cast, and such.  Hilligloss, trained in the Method by Strassberg but denied any hint of her character's motivation by the director, only made one other film, &quot;Curse of the Living Corpse&quot; (1964), but this film is enough to secure her reputation in the field.  Sidney Berger (the all too friendly guy down the hall at her boarding house) does a cameo as a cop in the 1998 &quot;Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls&quot; debacle, which does not compare on any level to this evocative horror classic.<br />This DVD collection is another outstanding member of the Criterion Collection.  Disc One has the original theatrical version (missing 7 minutes due to cuts by the producer), &quot;The Movie That Wouldn't Die! The Story of 'Carnival of Soul'&quot; documentary from the 1989 cast reunion, 45 minutes of outtakes with Gene Moore's organ score, the theatrical trailer, an illustrated history of the Saltair resort, and &quot;The Carnival Tour&quot; video update on the film's locations.  Disc Two has Harvey's original cut of the film and excerpts from industrial films made by Harvey, along with various essays, interviews, vintage photographs and memorabilia.

B00004TJJZ|4.0|Just a little clarification on my review below. When I used the term &quot;alien langauge&quot; I was referring to the profanity.  While the movie is NOT laced with it, in the few prominent spots where the B___S____ word was used, my youngest son echoed B____S____! and I heard my wife in another room yell &quot;WHAT?!!!&quot;  Don't get me wrong, I think it's a cool movie.  But parents should use discretion with younger children.  The four star rating I gave it was not based on the language however.  It was based on how much I liked it as a whole.
B00005JH9W|5.0|For years I had heard about the legendary Tod Browning film &quot;Freaks&quot; that so upset audiences it was banned in Boston and Great Britain.  I had read the short story &quot;Spurs&quot; on which it was based and when the film was finally screened on campus I talked my roommate into going with me.  Most of the people sitting around us knew nothing about the film and when I told them about it everybody started to get nervous.  Then the film began...and we all loved it!  My roommate and I both had crushes on Daisy Earles who plays Frieda in the film, opposite her husband Harry as Hans.  The story is quite simple: Hans and Frieda are a pair of midgets in love, but Hans thinks that Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) the bareback rider is beautiful.  Cleopatra plays with Hans' affections until she learns he has money.  Over the objections of her boyfriend, Hercules (Henry Victor) the freak show strongman, she accepts Hans' proposal.  During the wedding feast when the freaks accept her into their ranks, she makes it clear how much she despises them all.  But when Hans starts to become ill because of the poison she is feeding him, the freaks decide it is time to take matters into their own hands.  The film's climax, when the freaks chase Cleopatra and Hercules during a rainstorm, is truly chilling, although Cleopatra's final fate is as unreal as it is ironic.<br />All Browning really did to terrify audience was to include real freaks in his film, such as Daisy and Violet Hilton the Siamese Twins, Schlitze the Pinhead Girl, Josephine Joseph the Half-Woman/Half-Man, Johnny Eck the Half Boy, Frances O'Connor the Turtle Girl, Peter Robinson the Living Human Skeleton, Olga Roderick the Bearded Lady, Koo Koo the Bird Girl, Martha Morris the Armless Wonder, and Randion the Living Torso (who rolls his own cigarettes despite having neither arms nor legs).  However, the film clearly portrays the &quot;freaks&quot; with dignity.  As Madame Tetrallini (Rose Dione) tells someone, &quot;These are all God's children.&quot;  The true monsters in this film are the &quot;normal&quot; human beings, who receive their just desserts (supposedly a scene in which Hercules is castrated was cut from the film).  This is Browning's best film, not &quot;Dracula.&quot;  It is not even close.  You might screen this film for the first time because of its reputation, but you will watch it again because it is a good film.ese are all God's children.&quot;  The true monsters in this film are the &quot;normal&quot; human beings, who receive their just desserts (supposedly a scene in which Hercules is castrated was cut from the film).

630420065X|4.0|I enjoyed this film not only because of the great action but because you get to try to figure out a mystery.  While I was watching it with some friends I jokingly guessed who the &quot;mole&quot; was and who was in on the scheme with him.  Little did I know that I had guessed right and it was exciting to watch the plot unfold.  Although I was not completely blown away by the special effects, it could be because I only saw this movie on video and not in the theatre where it should be viewed.  Lots of action, good intense scenes, gotta use your head a little -- a good flick.
B00003CWL6|5.0|It's very rare that a film can make you laugh with genuine sincerity, yet move you with a true force of emotion. American Beauty shines from beginning to end, thanks to the deft direction by Sam Mendes and the brilliant screenplay by Alan Ball. Yet, Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, Wes Bently, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Chris Cooper only elevates this gem into a higher plane with the best ensemble performance of the decade. Wonderfully touching, yet never overwrought. Funny, but never degrading. To watch it is to experience it. Conrad Hall's photography makes it all look like a priceless painting that moves. At times, it is even sensuous, but mostly, it is illuminating. No amount of words can describe the beauty that this cinematic masterpiece generates. All the awards and praise reaped on this movie is all justified. And then some. Watch it, feel it. For those who have not watched it, you probably don't know what I am talking about. It's OK. Someday you will.
B00004XONN|5.0|Some may disagree. But I think the 4th installment from the Oxford boys is their finest. An ambient but powerful work, this album helped make the music world realise that different is definitely GOOD.
B00000IAU3|5.0|If your after a cd thats a little up beat, but soothing and something you can try to sing to then this is it.<br />All around pleasing..
B00004ZD69|5.0|The third and most possibly finest offering from the Canada nine is unbelievable. A rich, intense album consisting of 4 'stanzas' of overwhelming music. Appropriately titled, we are introduced to 'Lift Your Skinny Fists..' with 'Storm'- a beautifully bittersweet uplifting piece of music. We then travel through the album with 3 other musical journeys, all equally remarkable. Worth more than just a brief glance, this intense, edgy album will become a firm favourite of apocalyptic rock fans in no time. Amazing.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|Wow! If only my grandfather would have seen this movie, too.<br />A German Type VII submarine that survives explosions of depth charges less than 10 meters away, torps another dived submarine, dives below 200 meters regularly, goes muzzle to muzzle with a German destroyer (how did this thing get into the Atlantic anyway?) and sinks it with a single torpedo (not to mention an explosion like a Chinese nuclear torp)?<br />Sounds like the dream of 30.000 seamen come true.<br />Okay, enough sarcasm. It is a nice-made movie. What really surprised me is that - unlike most compareable movies - the original crew of U-571 was really speaking German language and all the gauges, levers and buttons have the correct markings. I really would like to know, if the U.S. version of this movie has subtitles, because the European version has none. Compared to - naturally - Das Boot, the optical presentation of U-571 is much better after 20 years, but the athmosphere of being inside such a steel tube is being presented much better on board of U-96 (a Type VII sub, too). Another point where U-571 can´t win against Das Boot is Klaus Doldinger´s great soundtrack of DB, but on the other hand, being much more action-oriented, U-571 got no long periods of talking, waiting and thinking that made Das Boot sometimes hard to bear for the typical action freak.<br />If you like submarines, light stories, well-made action and have seen movies like Hunt For Red October, Crimson Tide and Das Boot, you´ve found the right movie.<br />(but I still don´t understand how a Messerschmidt 109 recon bird can get that far into the Atlantic Ocean...)
0780622553|5.0|I held off on seeing Dark City for quite a while, the previews for it had me believing that it would only be a so-so sort of movie, so I ended up seeing a lot of other movies before finally watching this one.  This movie only reinforced my opinion that I should discount everything I see in trailers, since I've seen some really bad movies with good looking trailers, and waited so long to see this one because the trailer didn't seem all that interesting to me.<br /> This movie has a lot of sharp images, and a fair amount of special effects, but for once, the effects were an integral part of the story, and didn't seem like they were just tagged onto the movie because they were able to do them.  For me, everything was weaved together to create a strong looking, and strong feeling, movie.  As far as I'm concerned, there wasn't anything that really could have been taken out of this movie, or considered wasted time.<br /> The basic plotline behind the movie is that an alien species, with the ability to distort time and reality(what they call tuning), has come to our world, and is trying to see what it is exactly that makes humans human.  This story is told mostly through one man, John Murdoch(played by Rufus Sewell), who wakes up in a bathtub, with no memory, to find that he is wanted for having supposedly committed a series of murders.  From this starting point, he goes out into this strange world to find out exactly what the truth really is, and we join him on this journey.<br /> I don't want to give away too much of the movie, because a lot of the fun is in the discoveries that John makes along the way, particulary one that he makes about himself about ten or fifteen minutes into the movie.  I've heard some people talk about how they felt that the acting was a bit stiff in the movie, but as you come to realize what is happening in this city, the reason behind that begins to come clear.  The acting is meant to be somewhat stiff at times because each person is really onlybecoming a person as each new day starts.  That may sound a little confusing if you haven't seen the movie, but once you have, it will become clearer.<br /> I would recommend seeing this movie on DVD if you can, not just because of the clarity, but because after you've watched it once, you can watch it again, with the commentary running.  There are two commentaries, but I recommend putting on Roger Ebert's of the Sun Times.  I don't always agree with him on his movie reviews, but his commentary is very insightful, and I learned a lot of things, and found out a lot more things about the movie that I didn't catch on my first viewing.  So, pick this movie up, you won't go wrong.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This one rules.  We need movies like this again with guys that actually look like they could do some damage.  I am tired of seeing 90 pound woman and 120 men flying in the air kicking.  Bring back the real action.
078322947X|5.0|Movies don't get any better than this. The convergence of seemingly different stories into one thrilling and compelling adventure is Friedkin at his best.  If you're not glued to the screen as you watch it then you probably don't have a pulse.
B00005AXEL|5.0|THE QUEEN OF ROCK 'N' ROLL IS BACK AND BETTER THAN EVER!!  OKAY, THERE IS NO &quot;EDGE OF SEVENTEEN&quot;--  BUT THAT WAS 21 YEARS AGO, 1980, THIS IS 2001 AND THIS IS THE PERFECT ALBUM FOR THIS 'TIME AND SPACE'.  ALL I'M DOING IS LISTENING TO THIS CD OVER AND OVER AND I JUST LOVE IT MORE AND MORE EVERY TIME.  THANK YOU, STEVIE!!  YOU ARE TRULY THE GREATEST!!  PLEASE GO ON TOUR SO WE CAN BOW DOWN AND PAY HOMAGE TO YOU IN CONCERT, AND PLEASE DON'T MAKE US WAIT ANOTHER 7 YEARS UNTIL YOU RELEASE YOUR NEXT ALBUM!!
B000002L7Y|5.0|Everytime I mention A-Ha, people's first words are usually &quot;one-hit wonder.&quot; These people have obviously never heard &quot;Hunting High and Low.&quot; This album is undoubtedly one of the greatest pieces of music to come from this decade! Think New Order and Ultravox with high notes that no American male could even begin to reach. Any serious fan of synth-pop should own this CD and listen to it extensively. A perfect antidote for the bland [stuff] that passes for &quot;pop&quot; these days.
B000002E5J|5.0|The first time I heard her songs &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; and &quot;Octavo Dia&quot; on the radio, my reaction was: &quot;Wow, that's the best I've heard in a long time; who is she?&quot; Such intelligent lyrics; such a beautiful, inimitably inventive voice.<br />Here was no Christina Aguilera or Jennifer Lopez. Here was no Alanis Morrisette. She stood brilliantly apart, in a class all her own. Since then, I can't seem to listen to enough of her music.<br />Listen to the samples on Yahoo Music (which has one for every song in this CD). They will do much better than any description I can give here. &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; is cool, witty and easy-to-digest stuff, wonderful by itself. But to really appreciate Shakira's astounding talent, you have to listen to her live in the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; release. There she unleashes an acoustic performance whose energy, excellence, and vocal inventiveness strains the imagination. <br />Such perfection doesn't come free-- she hasn't come up with any new music for a while. But if after the hiatus she releases a few songs, I can bet they will be pure gold (which rarely appears in lumps, anyway), and be sure that I'll be there to hear them!<br />I'm not Latino, although my Spanish is fluent, so I can say this without any cultural bias: she has the potential to be the greatest female pop-rock singer, in any language.
B000002MP2|5.0|I'll start out this review with an observation that I don't think anyone else has made (I didn't read all 200+ reviews, though):  Green Day's Tre Cool is one of the best rock/punk/alternative drummers on the planet.  Yes, that bizarre guy who recently on the Leno show dived through his whole drum kit and ran up into the audience arms flailing and out of the building, is EXCELLENT.  He plays exceptionally fast, but is tight, driving and powerful as hell.  Cool's superb drumming on this album might be the real reason the songs are so good.  If you don't believe me from your memory, put this cd on and listen for yourselves.  I can't imagine how Nirvana's Dave Grohl received some accolades from critics and fans, yet Cool gets next to no recognition.  Grohl did not possess a single molecule of talent as a drummer and fits the bill as Dire Straits' proverbial bonehead rocker &quot;banging on the bongos like a chimpanzee.&quot;  Cool is 180 degrees the opposite (at least while he is playing).<br />The tracks on this cd are all strong.  It is highly unusual for groups in the past 15-20 years to put out albums without a few (or many, as is often the case) lousy or filler songs, but Green Day have managed to do that on Dookie.  Their songs here are all good to excellent, consistent from first to last.  Some reviewers may feel this cd isn't a &quot;real&quot; punk album and that Green Day sold out in making this album - if Dookie is a &quot;sellout,&quot; then isn't London Calling also a &quot;sellout&quot; for the Clash?  Does the inclusion of the cover of Needles and Pins on Rocket to Russia make the Ramones a &quot;sellout?&quot;  Dookie is good, hard-driving music with a sense of humor and I like it regardless of how some so-called punk purist with 18 facial and 22 body piercings feels unhappy about how Green Day replaced some of punk's noise with genuine tunes on this album.  Some other people might be put-off by the fact that so many of these songs got too much airplay in the year after this cd's release.  There is a good reason why so many of these songs were singles, namely, that they are very good and appeal to a broad range of listeners.  It's been years since this cd was released, so give it another try now that it is not on the airwaves every hour.<br />An excellent album.  Buy it, turn up volume, smile.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I bought this DVD and was totally blown away! I've heard the band live before but I have to say that they totally outdid themselves with this. Scenes From a Memory was fantastic, and the bonus materials are great! The DVD is worth the 'Mind Beside Itself' songs alone. As always, the band plays great, but LaBrie's vocals were dead on that night. I developed a new respect for the band after seeing some of the stuff they do live. This is a must-have for any Dream Theater fan.
6301969294|4.0|Ayn Rand, author of *The Fountainhead*, did a great job of adapting her novel for the silver screen. The screen play does a supurb job of picking the crucial lines and events, so that the plot of a 700 page book fits comfortably in a 2 hour movie. I highly recommend this film to the seasoned Rand fan and the newcomer alike.<br />Unfortunately, the tight plot and excellent screenplay are marred by sub-par acting and delivery. Lines early in the movie are delivered by actors who appearantly don't understand their meaning. The lack of proper intonation, emphasis, and pause make the plot more difficult to follow (so much so that it helps to read the book first). On the positive side, Patrica Neal put in an impressive performance as Dominique. Gary Cooper is also a relatively good fit for Howard Roark, although his delivery of Roark's courtroom speech and his expression in the final scene leave much to be desired.<br />In spite of these flaws, *The Fountainhead* and its theme are too good for anyone to miss. This is a great movie to see and a good one to keep.
0920668372|1.0|This book really gives me the creeps.  We received a copy as gift and I gave it away. I know it's very popular, more so with adults than children, but I think you either love it or hate it.  I hated it.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is the most underated Floyd album and maybe one the most underated albums of all time.  It gets better with more listens instead of worse(like The Wall becomes annoying).  This album is right up htere with Dark Side and Wish You Were Here.  This album reminds very much of classical music, because much of it os instrumental and no song is based on some catchy repetitive hook (which dominates music today).  Listen to it a few times before judging it, you'll thank yourself later.  Musically as far as Floyd albums go, this album is the opposite of the Final Cut,(minimal synth, little guitar, and very vocally driven), and and lyrically just as good.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This is yet again an amzing movie by the best director ever Guy Ritchie!!!<br />This movie with two brilliently acted, directed and written criss crossing tales in one movie. This movie begins with Turkish and Tommy. Two gangsters stuck in the middle rank of the mafia are supporting bare nuckle boxing fights with the all ruthless and evil villain, Brick Top. They go out to buy a trailer from a pack of pikies and meet their leader Mickey (Brad Pitt). After only moments of owning the trailer it breaks and they find they've been ripped off. When the demand their money back their star bare knuckle boxer Gorgeus George is beatten by Mickey. <br />The other tale of a diamond hiest by Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) set to bring back the diamond the size of a fist to New York where his boss Cousin Avi (Dennis Farnia) is killed and the diamond is stolen. Avi then flies to London where he was last seen to find his diamond where he hires a bounty hunter Bullet Tooth Tony. <br />As these funny and exciting tales continue you never know what will happen next to these crazy characters!!!!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|I cannot say in words how much I like this movie. Russel Crowe does the BEST acting of his carrier, along with Jaquin Phoenix who does an extremely good job of a bone-chilling villain. I wish I could give this movie a hundred stars!! The action is great, and their is little gratuitus violence.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This movie is a pleasant shock to me.<BR><BR>    I have not imagined seeing a 'ballet movie' whose music consists of glam rock and punk rock. Music of T-Rex, the Jam and the Clash impressed me with the vulnerability of Billy, would-be-dancer boy, and the anger of British working class. So it's not only a boy's success story but also a conflict story of his father between his devotion for labor movement against rich-poor cleavage and his self-sacrifice for his son. When the father is caught betraying his union comrades for money by his son Tony and burst out crying, I could not keep back my tears.<BR><BR>    But Billy (Jamie Bell) drives all the troubles away with his youthfulness. His dance seems to say, don't give up!
0767802470|5.0|Indeed, all these people with their raving reviews are all wrong. &quot;Das Boot&quot; is not a war movie, it is an anti war-movie. It is about real people trying to overcome the cataclysmic events that were larger than themselves. It shows how the hardships of war can bring the best of a person to the surface, and also the worst. The actors are real, you can see the fear in their eyes and you know: &quot;this is how it must have been&quot;. No Holywood drama with a crew in crisp uniforms but filth, odors, half rotten food, lice, grease, noise.<br />The only other anti-war movie of such caliber is also German and dates from 1959: &quot;Die Brücke&quot; (The Bridge) from Bernard Wicki. A detail of teenagers is assigned to uselessly defending a useless bridge during the last days of WW2. They start of as heroes and gradually reality dawns until all but one die in a battle with a US tank-unit which they defeat (a true story). If thatone ever comes out on cassette or DVD: buy it and put it next to &quot;Das Boot&quot;.
B00000253N|5.0|This album is a classic in the true sense, the kind of record that stays with you for a lifetime. Every listen opens new doors to the genius of Dylan. These arent just songs, they are 4 minute (give or take) screenplays, with intriguing characters, exotic locations and mind bending plots. Any one song on this album would make a lesser artist a &quot;career record&quot;. I recently took my 11 year old son to see Bob, and after a heart rending version of &quot;tangled up in blue&quot;, I looked at him and said I hope you appreciated that, because it was as good as it gets&quot; Enough said.
B00000K19E|5.0|True, this movie DID emulate some antecedent sci-fi, action, thriller filcks and all, but the film we saw (and repetitiously enjoy, hopefully) is still undeniably a peice of delicious eye-candy is it not?  Yes, there were sporadic incidents which the W-bros used techniques that were seen in other movies (i.e. the scene when Neo touched the broken glass and became something remeniscient of the liquid-metel T-1000 in T-2.  i.e. #2, in the showdown between Neo and Agent Smith in the subway where they both exhaust their clips and acknowlege it at an identical moment, which showcased the highlight from the opening Face/off gunfight between two flamboyant actors...), but so what?  This doesn't take any pleasure away from the viewer and it pays tributes to 2 of the most explosive action films ever made, what is condemnable about that?  For you critical movie-goers out there, just consider all the inferior films in which you busted a communsurate 8 bucks to watch, and for you extremely critical reviewers who diss this movie just because its a genuine crowd pleaser and HAS an abundance of SE's, I advise you to write a critical essay on some other sci-fi action wanna-be that's really worth your effort (i.e. Battlefield Earth, The Avengers, etc.).  The Matrix definitely earned itself a place in this over-apreciated genre by smoothly combining thought-provoking elements from others.  By the way, for those of you that like The Matrix will surely appreciate Pitch Black as well.  Thx for reading this!
0060977264|5.0|Paulo Coelho's &quot;By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept&quot; was an amazing philosophical journey for me. Recommended by my school librarian, I delved in to the book one night and could not bring myself to put it down until I had finished! Mr. Coelho's brilliant embrace of controversial ideals more than adequately covered the essential human emotions that every man, woman, and child feel at some point. I feel that the philisophical viewpoints presented in the intriguing storyline of this book truly aquaint connotative meanings of thoughts and ideas with the reader. I was able to relate with the story and the characters on a wonderfully personal level; I felt that I have had experiences similar to those of the characters themselves. I highly recommend this book to any and all people who may be looking for a subtle, yet empowering, read.
B000003TA4|5.0|I first had this album in 1995 and Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; really introduced me to alternative music . I've been a big fan of Nirvana ever since I listened to Nevermind . This album has lotta emotions and sounds , such as punk, hard pop, and hard rock . Though critics often said Nirvana and other Seattle bands were grunge . I love this album and its definently the best album of the 90s cos it brought modern rock called alternative to the mainstream . Back then alternative wasnt that huge while hairbands took the stage. You can listen to &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; lots of times and mosh it and sing along to it or play the song on your guitar. This album done it all . It changed music forever and thats why it brought alternative music to MTV .
B00003CXP1|1.0|This IS one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. I am a filmmaker and Darren is, IMHO one of the monster directors of our time. That said, this version being palmed off to unsuspecting film fans is a travesty. To be clear, LOVED THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATER. I hate, hate, hate this abomination. Look for the NC-17 version if you want to see what the filmmaker wanted you to experience in this movie. This is an adult movie with very adult themes, why, why, why, gut it in the edit suite?? So you could eek out a few more sales to the kiddies??
0141000198|2.0|I'm sorry to say, but I was very disappointed by this &quot;redacted&quot; version of the original.  I ordered it online expecting the original, but found that it was not nearly as funny.  I remember laughing out loud reading the original on the train!  As expected, I highly recommend the original (a 5 Star Plus!).  I also have to say that I was disappointed that there was nothing at amazon stating that it wasn't the original.
0375501851|5.0|I read great reviews, so I was hesitant to start this book for fear of being disappointed.  What  a pleasant surprise to find the writing of a high caliber, with interesting and unlikely characters.  At times the historical bits drag, but for the most part I found the plot to move nicely.  I was surprised by the ending, expecting it to be more dramatic, but I still liked it.  A great big substantial read.
B000002I2G|5.0|I dont care what anyone says- the soft parade is far and away the best Doors album. The lyrics are the most poetic, the arrangements the most interesting and Morrison's singing is at its finest on this album. The song &quot;the soft parade&quot; is the band's pinnacle, and far outshines a so-called epic tune like &quot;l.a. woman&quot;. I have been listening to the Doors off and on for 20 years and the soft parade is the only album that still endures.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I've been listening to Moulin Rouge for a couple of days now and always, unfailingly, it makes me smile. This is an eclectic collection of music and performers but they fit together well.<br />I've heard Ewan McGregor sing before, on Chemical Brothers' &quot;Setting Sun,&quot; and he was quite good. Here, he outdoes himself. He is sincere and passionate, and even when he sings &quot;I will aaaalways love you&quot; in the Elephant Love Medley, which really IS a medley! - close your ears if you need to for just a second - you believe him. Now, Nicole Kidman was a very pleasant surprise. No, she isn't better than Dido or McLaughlan but she has a lovely voice that she controls well, and what she lacks in vocal strength, she makes up for in the acting department. And her &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot; is extremely poignant - on certain days I can imagine myself shedding a tear to this song.<br />Roxanne simply rocks! It's an impassioned, dark, WICKED number, and the addition of Ewan's voice in the background adds another degree of intensity. Hindi Sad Diamonds is another of my favorites, that starts with the anxious repetition of &quot;I only speak the truth,&quot; and finishes on a sad note by Nicole.  Beck's interpretation of Bowie's Diamond Dogs is very interesting. Bowie himself sings Nature Boy, a lyrical introduction to this collection, and then repeats it with Massive Attack that add another whimsical touch to the CD. Another great, entertaining, dance all night away number is Because We Can Can Can!! by Fatboy Slim who hasn't produced a bad single for a soundtrack yet. The spirit of Moulin Rouge clearly comes out in all these numbers.<br />I'm no fan of the divas that sing Lady Marmalade hence I will not pass judgement on it in this review. Children of the Revolution that features U2's Bono is not very memorable.<br />This is a CD that will surprise you and will definitely touch you. I am looking forward to the movie - with such a soundtrack, it has to be something else! And I want to see Nicole Kidman perform Sparkling Diamonds/Material Girl in person. And here her sing Come What May with Ewan onscreen. Enchanting.mething else! And I want to see Nicole Kidman perform Sparkling Diamonds/Material Girl in person. And here her sing Come What May with Ewan onscreen. Enchanting.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This movie is an amazing movie.  The actors in this movie all give great performances.  This is made by the same guy who did Pi and if you havent seen that you should see it as well.  He has a nack for making things interesting, for making what some might find boring and making it intense and real.  Everything about this movie is great.  It is fairly depressing but to me this movie is one of the greatest and most realistic movies about drugs that has ever been made.  Traffic got all sorts of attention but in my oppinion it introduced nothing new, it showed you nothing of what the world of drug addiction can be like.  This movie is shocking in many ways and if you want to watch a movie that is going to make you feel all happy when you get done watching it this is not the one for you, you might want to go rent disney or something.  What this movie is is an intelligent and provacotive look at a world in which there is much hope to go around but that hope is never realized, it is a honest look at what it is like for some to live a life of drug addiction and it is also a wonderfull and shocking and entertaining movie.
B000002MJC|5.0|Songs Of Faith And Devotion could be Depeche Mode's most underrated album to date.  A common misconception about SOFAD is that it was a sell-out to the grunge movement of its time.  The only song on the album that might pass as being grunge, however, is \\"I Feel You,\\" and only for its hard edge and raw emotion.  The rest of the album has too much depth and complexity, both musically and lyrically, to be classified as a sub-genre of grunge music.  Although the album contained some raunchy sounds, it maintained a spiritual aura from start to finish.  In a year when bands like Pearl Jam and The Spin Doctors dominated the scene, Depeche Mode held themselves to a higher standard and forged a completely different sound.<br /> Also somewhat of a misconception was that Depeche Mode abandoned their roots on this album.  It was a departure in the sense that live drums and more guitars were incorporated into the music, but SOFAD was still part of the band's evolutionary process.  Martin Gore had actually started sneaking guitars into the mix on Music For The Masses, with the guitar work becoming more pronounced on Violater.  SOFAD became a bigger outlet for this side of the band.  Also, the album elaborated on typical Depeche Mode themes.  Lyrically speaking, it's arguably Martin Gore's most inspired songwriting.<br /> I consider SOFAD to be my favorite DM album.  That's a strong statement coming from someone who loves everything from Speak &amp; Spell onwards.  Unfortunately, SOFAD wasn't well received by the general public and many DM fans alike.  Martin Gore stated at the time of its release that they wanted to challenge their listeners.  It's not the kind of album everyone's supposed to like (DM fans included), but most people weren't up to the challenge.
B000009CEM|3.0|Fear Factory are a good enough band in places but this is not a great album. There are so many places that seem a bit empty, that could easily be changed or improved. Burton C. Bell hardly ever sings melodically and when he does it usually sounds a bit [bad]. You're often left waiting for the song to really get going and they never do. This also contains some pretty [terrible] songs like Cars (I originally thought that was done as a joke but I was sadly mistaken). The choruses are OK but the verses leave you thinking 'Isn't it obvious that this doesn't sound very good?'. The tone of the bass guitar also sounds [bad], just listen to Edgecrusher and you'll see what I mean. Plus I can't stand the annoying scratches in that song!!<br />I was really looking forward to hearing this album after hearing Demanufacture, but I was so sorely let down. It's really a shame coz I do think that this album had a lot of potential and I like the idea of concept albums. Burton C. Bell does have a great voice, and Raymond Herrera is a great drummer (Dave Lombardo's spiritual heir - if you think Raymond is good then you should seriously check out Slayer!!). Soul Of A New Machine, thier first album, is a bit better and much more death-metal, while Demanufacture is like this but much better and is my personal favourite. If you only want to bother with one FF album then get Demanufacture. Don't bother with this, even if the special edition version is only going for a tenner. If you do like this though then I recommend Demanufacture, Machine Head's Burn My Eyes or Slayer's Live: Decade Of Agression.
0440180295|5.0|Through Vonnegut's use of his incredibly developed satirical style, and the use of motifs, Vonnegut masterfully achieves his main goal for Slaughterhouse Five, to show how horrible is the aftermath emotionally, of war.     Vonnegut begins by introducing his main character, Billy Pilgrim.  Billy is an already emotionally fragile human being that is forced into an assistant chaplain position in the US Army on the European front of World War II during the Battle of the Bulge.  The war eventually causes Billy to go crazy, believing that he is actually time traveling and has encountered and been taken captive by an alien race from trillions of miles away.   There is plenty good reason for this, Vonnegut says throughout the book, by offering up several motifs that alone classify war as a horrible thing.  For instance, Vonnegut often says that the feet of a dead or dying man are \\"ivory and blue\\" (92), colors that connote stiff, cold death.  Whenever a character of Vonnegut's is near or approaching death, he notes that his feet are ivory and blue, an image that really hits upon the reader as expressing the horrible nature of war.  Another awfully graphic motif is that of \\"mustard gas and roses\\" (93), an oxymoron, for sure, one horrible smell grouped with the epitome of good scents.  Vonnegut uses this imagery to describe many things, his own breath for one, and also the smell of war.  The significance of the author's breath smelling like that of war serves as a constant reminder to him what he had to face during the war and never allows Vonnegut to escape his wartime experiences.    Vonnegut also uses a load of often grotesque and horrible, if not odd, similes and metaphors to further his purpose.   One instance occurred near the end of the book, not the end of the action, because of the constant variances in the setting of the book, and compared the bombed Dresden to the surface of the moon (230).   There is no life on the surface of the moon, and so it was in Dresden after 175,000 of it's inhabitants were killed.   Vonnegut is a master of language, and one time compared the smell of old books to \\"flannel pajamas that hadn't been changed in a month, or Irish stew\\" (128).  These and other odd comparisons contribute to the feeling of overwhelming that accompanied the war.   Among other ridiculous comparisons was a very striking comparison.  Vonnegut is describing the prisoners of war as compared to their captors, their guards, and writes \\"here is light opera\\" (191).  The guards, nervous because of their ill preparation and experience find at the opening of the cattle cars in which the captors are transported that these soldiers are worse off then them, a reminder of the innocence of the soldiers of the war.    Vonnegut's satiric style played the largest part in his anti-war novel toward this cause.   The most profound example of his horrible cynical writing style comes from his repetitive use of the phrase \\"So it goes\\", and is used every time anything, no matter how insignificant, or incredibly important, dies.   Vonnegut varies the usage of this phrase from the death of lice and bacteria during a delousing, to the death of millions of Jews.   This usage displays the dehumanizing nature of the war, and the hopelessness as well by understating the fact that so many died so violently.  The reader is so offended by the understatement, that the opposite effect takes place.  The reader is able to qualify the deaths of these people more profoundly perhaps, then if Vonnegut did so himself, a masterful writing technique, indeed.  Vonnegut must be one of the most under-appreciated, least known masters of literature still alive and writing today.   His style, his writing ability, and his masterful uses of innuendo clearly separate him from the Steven Kings, and John Grishams of the more popular writing circles into groups with Fitzgerald, Steinbeck, and Hemingway.
6301247485|3.0|Jack Clayton's version of the Great Gatsby does not compare to F. Scott's Fitzgerald's original book. Clayton was very meticulous to details. The costumes each character (whether a principal or an extra) wore were magnificent and very true to the post World War I era. Clayton's wardrobe obviously researched and created replicas of 1922 outfits. The location Clayton chose as West Egg and East Egg looked like they were created right from Fitzgerald's words. Gatsby's enormous mansion and Tom Buchanan's house were perfect picks. Clayton's eye for detail in wardrobe and location did not make up for his poor choices for casting. Though Sam Waterson was a perfect choice as the mellow Nick Carraway, Clayton did not make a good decision when casting Bruce Tern as the, \\"great big hulking physical specimen,\\" Tom Buchanan. Bruce Dern is an average sized man with average attractiveness. Therefore he does not give off the intimidation Fitzgerald displays in the character. For example, in the pivotal, climatic scene in the Plaza hotel, Dern's decision to play Tom as a passive aggressive man does not give the scene nearly the amount of tension and awkwardness it had in the novel. Fitzgerald depicts Tom's emotions as running very high during the heated scene in the hotel. Dern never raises his voice and remains calm while his wife admits her infidelity. This scene is the climax of the novel, and Clayton does not give it as much thought as the beaded headress Daisy wears to Gatsby's party. Clayton's interpretation of this classic novel, is certainly beautiful to watch and wholeheartedly deserved the Academy Award for Costume design but does not capture Fitzgerald's complex characters.
B00003CXYW|2.0|The original work is in my top 10 movies of all time. BUT, the directors cut ruined the movie.  They removed the inner monolog which help to explain ALOT of things in the movie.  Plus the ending is bogus.  It just ends and leaves you witb an uneasy constipated feeling.  Lucky for me I have a vhs version of the movie to take of my Blade Runner withdrawls.  If there is a God of movies out there, please release the original with the extra footage. Pllllleeeeeaaaaaasssssssseeeeeeeee.
B00000DR5I|5.0|In January of the memorable Anno Domini 1975 Tangerine Dream topped anyone's expectations. The shortest album in their history knocks you literally down. It's just perfect. Short, yes, very short, but there goes a saying - small is beautiful! Mein Gott, it starts as if it were an ancient soundtrack to Edgar Allan Poe's &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;. The impressions you have bear by no means slight a resemblance to horror. Even if you know Rubycon and are familiar with its mysteries, the intra to each of the two compositions are still creepy. &quot;Rubycon - part II&quot; reminds me the end of the world, in particular. <br />The nucleus of each theme on Rubycon is your beloved (as I can guess) ostinato. The first one is monumental, slow and getting progressively louder. It rocks! The second one is as wild as Franke himself. The never-ending spiral mutates abruptly into sea, as if they dumped their Moogs and Mellotrons into the brainwaves of Mother Earth. From there again emerges the tune. Mesmerizing tune by Peter Baumann. It will stay with you, for long. Maybe for your whole life. In fact, sometimes I think they are smart. Loosely thinking in the dark I sometimes think that they did it on purpose. A giant recording company paid them extra money to make the album short enough to force audiophiles to use the loop function in their players. Oh my, I do loop my player. All this is certainly my own madness, but what I want to do is to plant a seed in your own head. To rescue you from pain that is inevitable, if your player is set on a play-once option. Loop yourself and send a check of gratitude to my secretary. <br />Rubycon is memorable. Rubycon is my friend. Rubycon is what I listen to while reading good novels. Rubycon is what I think about, or hum, while I climb. Rubycon is a private treasure that I never share with anyone, even with my women. I need Rubycon. I simply couldn't have lived without Rubycon. What else can I write to encourage you to purchase thething? I honestly don't know.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|If you're a die-hard macho punk rock fan, and under the age of 20, well, you won't like this album at first listen. &quot;Yeah, first song is great....well they even do rockabilly? ....And even raggae...Oh, my god! Is Clash a disco band in 70's???&quot; You would be guilty to buy this album and throw it away into CD rack. But wait. Wait till you're over 20 and have ability to accept many kinds of music from country to Jazz/Classical. You would then L/O/V/E this! This album is full of whole lot of energy, but supply it as a polished and artful form. And as much a diverse way as you can imagine. You know, this sort of thing we call ART.
B00004C4L6|3.0|The guitar player, Edgar Froese, founded Tangerine Dream in the fall of 1967. At first, the band played various compositions of the time (covers) and tried to develop their own style. Froese was inclined towards experimentations and free form in rock music. Hence he welcomed musicians playing nonstandard instruments, who shared the same vision. It took time however, to get straight on these goals. Many musicians came and went. In 1969 they recorded their debut single, Ultima Thule, which, if it had been included in Electronic Meditation, would have nicely contrasted the material. In June 2000 a long-awaited compilation was issued, entitled Ancient Dreams, where you can find Ultima Thule. Quick rock instrumental songs with violin and guitar.  <br />The first album recording of Tangerine Dream, Electronic Meditation, sounds as if recorded in the depths of a well. One could say that the stuffing for plush chairs at least found its alternative application. Instead of chair decoration, they were put on the speakers. As the story goes, the trio did not have any professional publishing plans at the time of recording, which partially explains the quality. On the other hand, Electronic Meditation is a manifesto of artists' musical freedom. The flagship of experimental rock. Yes, it is still rock, despite the enigmatic title. <br />Out of the three musicians who appear on this album, all have become famous in their own way. Edgar Froese continued with Tangerine Dream and co-pioneered so-called electronic rock (or electronic music). From Electronic Meditation, he carried away only the band's name with himself. Klaus Schulze became the grandfather of dark, meditative music and patented the sequencer ostinato that is nowadays sampled by various techno youngsters. From Electronic Meditation, Klaus carried away the title and made it his musical motto. Conrad Schnitlzer apparently continued with experimentation. In over 30 years that have passed since 1969, he pushed experiments tothe absolute limits. <br />Although by itself this album is not fascinating, it stands as a monument in electronic music history, a landmark.
B000003B6J|4.0|In the classic rock'n'roll tradition, these guys made a boatload of money being controversial by pretending to be something they weren't (i.e. gangsters from &quot;the street&quot;), knowing that dumb young black kids (white ones too, although I bet they never expected that) would fall for it hook line &amp; sinker. Bit like a black rap version of the Sex Pistols, with an equally &quot;shocking&quot; name, except they were more professional about it. Great music, I defy anyone not to want to get up and dance to this stuff, there's no denying it's full of quality tunes even if you're like me and don't usually give a tinker's fart about rap. Just don't buy into the ganster BS, and try not to laugh too hard or choke on your beer when faker multi-millionaire Dr Dre moans about his songs getting pirated.... Also check out the response from many black folks to Eminem (who actually DID grow up on the street) compared to these guys half of whom were verging on middle class - kind of ironic.
B000001G16|5.0|Just acquired a copy of &quot;Stranger in This Town,&quot; and the more I listen to it the more impressed I am.  This is a great collection of jazzy, blues and sexy love songs.  Lyrics and music are both great, as well as Richie's guitar playing.  I especially love &quot;Rosie&quot;, &quot;The River of Love&quot; and &quot;Father Time.&quot;  Richie Sambora has it all.  He can sing, play, and write songs, and he is the greatest.  Look forward to seeing him in concert in Greenvile, SC May 15.
B0000009TJ|5.0|This is an awesome live recording with some of Frank Zappa's best music! The sound is superb and the live-feeling really stunning. Frank Zappa had the best musicians and that is obvious here. The guitar solo's are amazing as usual. The overall feeling of this disc is just great and it should be a must-have in every Zappa collection!
0805047905|5.0|I bought this book when my son was only 7 months old and it has been one of his favorites ever since.  Now that he is almost 2 he can read it to me!  He even recites the lines when he is reading other books.  He will read &quot;football, football what do you see&quot;, it's the sweetest thing.  Buy it, your child will love it too.
B0000025F7|5.0|Off The Wall sold 12 millions and it was the first album to spawn five hits in Britain. It stayed 173 weeks on the British albums chart. Off The Wall is probably regarded as Michael Jackson's best album by many though it may not have sold as much as Thriller. An artist's best work is not always the one that sells more copies. There is no denying that Michael Jackson has talent whatever you might think of him. Often his music is overshadowed by tabloid reports. Now let's focus on the music.<br />The album starts off with Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, which was written by Michael Jackson solely. After a spoken intro  the music is launched by a horn. It seems to me that the music is built by layers of instruments. Michael Jackson's highpichted voice has the lead part against his lower voice. They blend perfectly together. The lyrics seem to be about a force, which includes physical passion, spirittual love and the emotional dance. In my opinion one of the best tracks on the album Off The Wall.<br />The second track on the album Rock With You was released as the third single off the album. It reached no. 1 in America and no. 7 in the UK. Rock With You was written by Rod Temperton, who also wrote the title track for another MJ album called Thriller. Again the song seems to have a similar message as Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, which would be a parallel between dance and sex. <br />Another highlight on the album is Working Day And Night, also written by Michael Jackson, which also has a dance feeling to it. The lyrics suggest that the main character can't understand why his girlfriend is so keen on making him work all the time. He seems almost certain that his girl is cheating on him. He would later perform it on the Bad and Dangerous Tour.<br />The title track Off The Wall has once again a theme about dancing away your worries and cares. The message behind the song is a positive one that even though life is tough at time everything isn't that bad at all. The chorusesare simply wonderful. He sings Off The Wall a bit tougher than Don't Stop Til You Get Enough and Rock With You.<br />She's Out Of My Life is the main ballad on the record. In my opinion one of Michael Jackson's best vocal performances ever. It has become best know for Michael's collapsing into tears at the end of the song. The song itself deals with a girlfriend that has left him and now he's aching with pain. He simply doesn't know what to do. She's Out Of My Life was released as the fourth single and it reached no. 10 in the US and no. 3 in the UK. Get On The Floor is a powerful, heartfelt and an energetic track that leaves you wanting more. The best part is the chant in the middle of the song.  Burn This Disco Out was written by Rod Temperton and it's the track that closes the album. Again the lyrics suggest about dancing your way though life.<br />The songs I have mentioned are in my opinion the highlights. They are simply filled with raw talent and powerful lyrics. Overall all songs on Off The Wall are good though there is one expection, which is the track Girlfriend. It's beyond me why this track appeared on the album. It's simply one of his worst songs ever. Otherwise all the songs on the album are perfect. <br />This is without a doubt my favourite Michael Jackson album and it's definitely a must have for everyone who claims they are a music lover. This record should be in your collection until then your collection isn't complete.
B00004T9UF|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I probably know every word on this cd. I do enjoy it, but as far as quality... it's not so hot. Seems like all of the pesimistic stuff... kill em, screw em, beat em, bla bla bla... which critics attack, and MM himself claims is part of his everyday life is just interesting. It is DEFINETLY a little too hot for some, meaning not all can handle it. But there are some definite good beats, catchy lyrics, and so on. A downer would be the annoying interludes either reasuring us once again the Mather's doesn't care what we think, or some nasty action that most of us don't want to hear... now you're curious huh. I don't think this is a very good cd, probably not worth all it costs, but if you're interested it can be some fun.
B000002N3J|3.0|I recently purchase this collection of romantic ballads from Madonna and it definitely surpassed my expectations since I'm more fond of her up-tempo stuff like Vogue, Express Yourself, Like A Prayer, Impressive Instant and Ray Of Light.<br />The album starts off with I Want You, which is a lovely and romantic song. I would call I Want You one of Madonna's sophisticated songs. Her voice is very powerful on this track though by no means I would call I Want You the best track on Something To Remember. The second track is I'll Remember, which sounds unbelievable fresh and the choruses are a pleasure listening to. I can't seem to remember whether or not it was released as a single. Oh well nevermind. Another favourite of mine is Take A Bow, which still doesn't sound dated at all. It reached no. 1 in America (I believe). Other highlights on the album are Oh Father, Crazy For You, This Used To Be My Playground. These songs sum up what Madonna is all about. One thing I admire about Madonna is her way of releasing new material that has such diversity to it though I don't consider Something To Remember among her greatest albums.<br />Overall Something To Remember is indeed a good album though some of the ballads lack strenght esp. her ''nineties'' ballads such as One More Chance, Rain, Love Don't Live Here Anymore (the remix version), You'll See and the title track itself Something To Remember. I was slighty disapointed with the choices of ballads on this collection. I mean where are ballads such as Bad Girl, Promise To Tell and Pray For Spanish Eyes.<br />If you are a fan of ballads this album is definitely a must buy. The album is maninly filled with some of the best ballads Madonna has ever done. It's a good album to start with if you want to know a little more about Madonna's tender side.
6304935811|5.0|George C. Scott gives the finest performance of his career has the fabled World War 2 general. The movie follows Patton's career from the North Africa Campaign to the end of the war. Jerry Goldsmith's excellent soundtrack really makes the film what it is. The film is also humorous. Patton always has to be criticized for something (Slapping a soldier, criticizing the Russians, e.t.c). Patton believes in reincarnation; thinking that he was a soldier in past lives. In one scene, where Patton and Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) are at an ancient Greek battlefield, when Patton describes the battle he says, \\"I was there\\".   <br />This is definitely one war movie (or any kind of movie) I would not mind watching over and over again.
0451167716|5.0|Still keeps me thinking about what the mafia life is like!
B00000IQBM|5.0|The Shining is as still frightening today as it was when it was made. Not as much, but it still is. Jack Nicholson plays one of his best performances as Jack Torrance, winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel along with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd), who has a special gift (The Shining) that can allow him to see things others can't and talk to people without moving his lips. In addition, a cook also has the Shining. <br />The film proudly shows the style of the late Stanley Kubrick everywhere in the film: Scenes that take place in a bathroom (Three as a matter of fact), very clean rooms with white floors, three-way conflicts, long shots, up-close shots, and a story of dehumanization. It also shows Kubrick's sense of humor, which includes sarcasm (When Jack talks about Danny's knowledge of cannibalism \\"...You see. It's okay. He saw it on the T.V!\\") and black humor (A butler with a head injury holds up a glass and says  \\"Wonderful Party, isn't it?\\" There is also a seen before HERE'S JOHNNY! when Jack says \\"Honey, I'm Home!\\")<br />The Shining is one of Kubrick's best films and one of the great horror films of all time. If you haven't seen it, you're missing a wonderful party!
B00003CXPC|4.0|Despite the critical acclaim, I honestly thought that this movie would be schmaltyzy, predictable, and formulaic. But I was pleasantly surprised--&quot;Billy Elliot&quot; is more than the sum of its parts! It's not just another quirky British comedy, or another boy-defies-father's wishes story.<br />The story has a great message of being yourself, and following your dreams. It's basically saying that no one knows what's best for you except yourself; do whatever makes you happy.<br />Jamie Bell was excellent as the title character--showing an impressive range of emotions. The rest of the cast was superb as well. And an unexpected surprise like Billy's supposed gay friend, just makes the movie more complex and interesting!<br />The ending was memorable as well, but I won't give it away.<br />You won't be disappointed in this movie, even if you're a macho man who's too insecure to think it's okay for boys to dance!
B00004YYDI|5.0|Most often action movies come along and prove to be mildly entertaining, but do not prove to be very memorable. Leon - The Professional is a completely different story. This movie's action sequences are not only fantastic, but in fact the story and the characters are the real treasure. Luc Besson has a masterful way of telling the story and his cinematic devices are luring and beautiful. The story reveals great depth and meaning, and quickly draws you in. Jean Reno who skillfully plays the larger than life hit man Leon is fascinating, instilling a feeling of wonder as to who is this person and the desire to know more about him. Natalie Portman who, also gives a fantastic performance as Matilda (in her first movie role), develops a uniquely special human relationship with Leon. The relationship between Leon and Matilda reveal the mutual sadness and loneliness that each of the characters possess and how their bond gradually heals the pain replacing it with genuine warmth and caring. Gary Oldman as always plays a great \\"bad guy\\" who you love to hate. The story is both gripping and memorable leaving a deep impression in the moviegoers psyche. This is definitely one of the best films I have had the fortune to see in recent years. This DVD containing the international uncut version with 24 minutes of additional footage that was not in the original U.S. release is wonderful and provides scenes that further explore the relationship between Matilda and Leon which are very worthwhile and add to the overall quality of the film. Thankfully the director placed the additional scenes within the film and not as deleted scenes in the additional features section of the DVD as is most often done. I highly recommend this film to all real movie lovers, it is one of the best action dramas ever made!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I'm 31 and my cousin is 16. We decided to go see this movie out of boredom. We thought it would be a rediculous movie that we could make fun of and laugh at. Well, barely 10 minutes into the show, we both looked at each other and said, &quot;Wow!, this is actually a REALLY good movie!&quot; We both agreed that on a scale of 1 to 10, this is definately a &quot;10&quot; movie. It's defiately going to be in both our DVD collections. Neither one of us are really into bluegrass music either, but with great songs like, &quot;Down To The River To Pray&quot; and &quot;Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; plus others, we could hardly wait for the movie to end so we could rush right out and buy the soundtrack. If you miss it in theaters, PLEASE make sure you at least rent this movie. Like us, you'll be pleasantly suprised.
B000006TRV|5.0|I recently bought a used copy of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; digitally remastered original version from Eric Roufs.  the response time was excellent!  the CD was mailed the next day, and I received it within five days.  Thank you, Eric.
0767903854|5.0|Bill Bryson gives a mesmerizing and entertaining guide to the glorious &quot;land down under&quot;. This is the first book of his I've read, but definitely won't be the last. Can't wait to pack my bags and enjoy all the wonderful places he so vividly describes! His sense of humor and in-depth historical information make this a great read.
B000050XEI|5.0|I think Enya is an amazing singer, who´s voice is sweet and powerfull at the same time.<br />While I listen to her music I feel as if all my worries were gone, she draws you into a &quot;state of mind&quot; were you feel relaxed and peaceful. And when I´m in trouble or I´ve got angry with somebody, I´ve got exams coming; I simply go to my room and listen to her , to dream awake hearing what she says in each of her songs and after that,I can assure I feel much better. <br />I compare her music with classical one and say: She is the XXI century's Beethoven! So if you like classical music, or you are stressed and you desperately want a bit of a break at the end of the day, spend a bit of your time with Enya!
0786915749|4.0|This is a work of both high and low fantasy, marking the beginning of a remarkable 6-book tale (the Chronicles Trilogy, followed by the even more magnificent Legends Trilogy), which greatly increased the interest in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game throughout the 1980's. (And here in 2001, it's still being read . . .) It certainly does contain more than a few stock fantasy elements (e.g. dragons, elves, dwarves, an unlikely group of friends somehow being chosen to stop the conquest of Evil . . .). However, the straightforward, simple way in which the tale is told and (even more so) the distinct, &quot;real&quot; nature of (most of) its characters set it apart from the paperback fantasy pack.<br />(Another wonderful aspect of the trilogy is the title sequence: autumn twilight, winter night, spring dawning. Why? Because this is the timeless pattern of fantasy tales: the strengthening of Evil compels weakened and bickering good forces to unite and strengthen, to become Good so that the glory of life may continue--weakness to death to resurrection, as with each turning year, as with us . . .)<br />Who can forget the irrepresible Tasslehoff, the conflicted Tanis Half-Elven, or the cynical, amibitious Raistlin as they strive to carry word of the ancient, true gods to a war-torn land? Some of the other companions (particularly Sturm and Riverwind) are a little bland in comparison, and the comic relief with the gully dwarves and the magician Fizban is sometimes too modern-feeling and cute (like the ewoks in Return of the Jedi).<br />Nonetheless, this series is worthwhile reading for the fantasy fan, often resounding with the true voice of a legend (greatly assisted by splendid songs and poetry throughout), leading onward into the heart of story (as one of the poems proclaims).
B000002UVZ|5.0|I had no idea that the purchase of this cassette in 1986 would change my musical taste forever.  Lifes Rich Pageant is simply perfect from start to finish.  REM takes the listener on a roller coaster ride of driving, infectious pop and rich, intelligent ballads with a relevent social motif.  I think the band really tried to create a unique album that would be smart and a bit more commercial than the previous four.  &quot;Begin the Begin&quot; is a rocker that fittingly starts the album and contains one of Peter Buck's greatest guitar riffs.  &quot;Flowers of Guatemala&quot; is a lyrically beautiful song with great harmonies and brilliant vocal layering.  &quot;Swan Swan H&quot; and &quot;Cuyahoga&quot; are wonderful reminiscent ballads that add nice texture to the album.  Most people are familiar with &quot;Fall on Me&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; (the two songs that launched REM into the somewhat mainstream).  Other great classic REM songs are &quot;These Days&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot;, and &quot;Just a Touch&quot;.  There are no bad songs and like most REM albums, this one should be listened to in its entirety.  A MUST!
0140283587|3.0|The book is about traveling, so I supposed it`s fitting that it works very well as a travel read.  I read the bulk of it on a 13 hour flight to Japan, and it set the stage well for my travels.<br />Sutcliffe does a very good job of expressing the feeling I often have when I`m done with a trip: that I`m glad I did it, but I don`t know if I would want to go through the whole experience again.<br />That said, much of the book seemed like it was missing something. The story is told from a first person perspective, which generally gives the reader a wonderful insight into the narrator.  However, in this case, I never felt like I truely understood the narrator.  Close at times, but never quite fully there.
B00003CXQX|5.0|This was a hilarious and fun movie that both young and old will enjoy. There is hardly a scene where there isn't something comical happening.  This is a movie that will appeal to everyone, even if they hate Disney movies.  The voices, characters and animation are just fantastic. The plot is unique and the music is great. I recommend you buy this one. You'll want to watch it over and over.
0399146253|1.0|Patricia Cornwell used to write really great books, but now she just keeps writing the same one over and over and over...  Let's see, we have the betrayal by a co-worker (check), the latest trauma for Lucy (check), the deep angst and depression (check), the persecution by mysterious groups (check), the gruesome killer with a weird agenda (check), and so on.  Honestly, the paranoia and self-pity are really getting boring.  I keep reading the new ones hoping she'll go back to her old form, but I'm just about to give up.  It's just too tedious!
B000002MY3|1.0|While Morissette has received lots of press since her debut I can't help but be surprised at the hoopla over her very minimal vocal ability. Morissette has gone far with a voice that sounds like nails on a blackboard. I actually turn off the radio when one of her songs comes on, something I've never done before. I tried to like her - listened to various songs &amp; albums - but just can't. Some of the ones who have benefitted from the doors opened by Alanis (Jewel, for example) are much more deserving of recognition in my opinion. Oh well, it's all subjective in the end. If you want to buy this album, listen to the tracks first to make sure it's up your alley.
0786915749|4.0|At the age of 36, I've finally decided to read this book and I was not disappointed. I agree with many of the reviewers that stated that this book is a little simplistic and cliched, but for me this did not prevent me from enjoying the tale.<br />I think what I appreciated most about this book was that the story was constantly moving foward. After wading partly through dull novels such as The Dragonbone Chair and Eye of the World before giving up (my insomnia became a thing of the past), reading this book, despite it's flaws, was an absolute pleasure. I have already purchased the remaining 2 books in this trilogy and intend on reading the Twins trilogy as well.<br />Good stuff.
0767817486|1.0|This film is an obvious result of the greek and armenian lobbies in the US. It is simply an anti-propaganda tool against a nation. The political purpose has been achieved. The introduction of all the Turks as monsters have created the mood effects for those who believe or lpretend to believe such a thing is possible, however for those who know the reality, it simply becomes a propaganda fantasy. A film in my opinion should rather have a priority in artistic matters.
0780020685|5.0|Astounding is a good description for Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.  I just rented this DVD and saw the film for the first time - I doubt it will be the last.  Widely regarded as Kurosawa's best - you won't be disappointed, but be aware that this film is over 3 hours long.  Stunning achievement, not to be missed.
014028009X|3.0|This book is sort of New-York-neurotic-though-semi-empowered-female-fiction (though not in New York).  It is pretty fun, I guess, and clearly people enjoy it.  <br />Still, it is a little thin.  The characters are paper, and, well, I just don't know.  Obviously a story doesn't have to be amazing or realistic to be good (I should hope not) but this is just ok.  And I really do like the aforementioned genre (even if I'm sometimes embarassed to admit it).
0790736241|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. It is insightful, engaging, and dares to be mysterious. Knowing it is based on Carl Sagan's book adds to the intrigue. I read a lot of science fiction. This movie is one of very few that allows me to maintain a great sense of wonder -- even though I already know the ending, I'd watch it over and over.
B00004Z459|5.0|an amazing album.My favorite band were papa roach untill i heard one step closer.I downloaded a few other songs and loved them.I just had to go and buy the album.Every song rules and the rapping song &quot;A place for my head&quot; realy stood out above the rest.Its gotta be their next single....  All the songs are great and the ones that stand out the most are definetaly : One step closer , Crawlin' , A place for my head , paper cut and points of authority.If your looking for a CD with a good combination of rap and rock then look no further.
B000005ZGZ|5.0|i must say it took me a while to like these guys.  i always respected them, bubt couldnt really get into theie music. a friend lent me end hits and i listened to it a couple of times and just still couldn't get into it.  but one day i just turned it on and it just clicked.  i couldn't stop dancing. the melodies were amazing and i cant believe i never noticed before.  if you dont like them at first you must give it a chance.  these guys know there [stuff] and you must give it a shot.  love this
B000002UR7|5.0|I agree with whoever said they loved the track &quot;Vegetable.&quot;  That is definitely my favorite track on the album. I think that this album is a great album in its own right.  It should not be compared with the Bends or OK Computer, because it was created for a different purpose.  It is every bit as good as those albums, and deserves credit for that.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This film was recommended highly to me but I had no idea of it's content before seeing. For the first five minutes I thought, what is this junk about. Soon I was hooked and by the time the film ended I was totally floored. Literally. This film will take your breath away. Ellen Burstyn was robbed of an Oscar. If you doubt that before seeing the movie you will have no doubt afterwards. See this movie, experience it's power. You will be totally overwhelmed.
630575067X|3.0|For all those critics who've been ranting on Lucas and The Phantom Menace lighten up.  It's a great movie.  That's the effect that Episode one is supposed to give off.  That things are good but they're going to get bad really soon.  I think it was genius to have Lucas cast Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker, it will make Anakins seduction to the Dark Side much more heart-wrenching.  Would Luke's salvation of Vader have been nearly as rewarding if he had been the cynic Han Solo?  We're talking about foils here.  If your paying attention instead of being overwhelmed and gawking at the special effects you can see the classic triology shinning through.  I think to many people are blinded to the real story because they can't get their eyes past the beauty of Naboo.  George Lucas is writting a Saga not just a compilation of unrelated stories, these movies are acts to a gargantuan story.
B00000099Y|4.0|This is a great CD to get started liking tool with. I first got into tool after i saw A Perfect Circle with Nine Inch Nails(another [cool] band only slighty better than Tool). My dad had had Aenima and I \\"borrowed\\" it. I was blown away. I could not believe how ... cool it sounded. The songs are extremely hard and long. The CD's title track is one of the best on the album and is on the longer side. It's over six minutes long but it's totally worth it. But the coolest song on the album is \\"Intermission\\". Which is a little breather from the hard rock tone of the alubm so your head doesn't explode. The coolest line from the album is from \\"Eulogy\\" in which maynard says\\"You said you'd die for me the, why you were surprised when you heard your own eulogy\\". That's great. A Great addition to any hard rock CD collection.
0451160916|5.0|I won't take the time to say more than is necessary about this Stephen King masterpiece. Part of the experience of The Shining is not knowing much about it beforehand, which is difficult because of Stanley Kubrick's movie. To say that you have experienced The Shining just because you've seen the movie means nothing. In fact, I would venture to say that I wish I had never seen the movie, or at least I wish that I had read the book first. Stephen King takes us further and further into a realm of insanity, and his writing can not be described. It is phenomenal. Each page of the book the reader feels insanity surrounding each character. I can't say anymore, because I want this book to be a pleasant, and deliciously scary surprise for its next victim..I mean reader. REDRUM REDRUM! Buy this book, you won't be disappointed.
B000002MY3|5.0|Think about it: In 1995, the phrase \\"Girl Power\\" wasn't in vogue yet. Then this CD burst onto our shores from this slightly built, 20-year-old young woman from Canada who, although quiet and reserved offstage, sung and performed with a tantric frenzy onstage that could only be described as completely electrifying. <br />As cliche'd as this may sound,the first time I heard \\"You Oughtta Know\\" I was completely blown away. I then saw the video for \\"Hand In My Pocket\\" and I knew that I HAD to buy this CD. I did, and for the next 8 months it hardly left my CD player. I fell in love with the entire album. As I was going through some rough time then, I felt that CD spoke to my angst, especially with the songs \\"You Oughtta Know\\", \\"Hand In My Pocket\\", \\"Right Through You\\", and \\"Ironic\\" (before it got overplayed). Eventually, as the popular radio stations unfortunately started overplaying her stuff to death, rendering some of them unlistenable to me to this day (\\"You Learn\\" and \\"Hand Over Feet\\" being the 2 prime examples), my copy of the CD began to stray from my player. I don't think I have played it in at least 2 years now. But one thing's for sure...I still never have gotten sick of \\"You Oughtta Know\\". That isn't just because this is the best song on the CD...no, it's much more than just a song; it is a musical manifesto. It speaks to anybody who has gotten jilted in a relationship, male or female. It has a fire all its own. Not only that, but it started the true Girl Power movement ..., for in its wake came songs by other wonderful young female singer-songwriters such as Joan Osborne, Jewel, and Paula Cole.<br />In closing, I just wish to express my gratitude to Alanis Morisette for helping me get through 1995, and to gain the strength that I needed in order to get myself to this MUCH better point in my life today. Thank you, Alanis...and keep on rockin', girl!

B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie was fantastic.  I was fully expecting another &quot;hippy&quot; movie and boy, could I have been more wrong?  Being born in the late 70's doesn't usually allow the characters to connect to me, but this movie was a timeless story of a boy growing up young and living an exciting life.  I would recommend buying this on DVD or at least renting.
B00000I4XR|5.0|I've heard stories, as I'm sure you all have, that Spielberg made this film strictly out of luck and he would throw up every morning because he thought he had blown his one pick chance.  Whether this is true or not this film is amazing.  If the tension and horror in this movie is done by accident, then you would have to imagine what can be done on purpose.  The fact that you don't even see the shark until the last 30 minutes of the film is ingenious.  All the performances are unforgetable.  Robert Shaw's speech is one of the greatest deliveries ever captured on film.  The documentary on this DVD is very good and covers everything during production, check it out.  THAT'S IT, I'M DONE!
6305922756|5.0|I've worn out my Spinal Tap video. It has always been my laughter security blanket. I recently went DVD and this was one of the first ones I got. The outtakes/deleted scenes (which I had only read about) add so much more to what was already a great film. I laughed 'til I had tears.<br />But I laughed most while listening to the running commentary by David, Nigel and Derek both at the beginning of the disc (discussing how black the screen was) and during the movie (commenting on who they though was dead, now...how Marty's beard was fake....on Ian being...Ian, and the dreaded Janine...etc.)<br />I think this film on DVD is an example of why the format is so wonderful. <br />Just great.
B00005ASQ1|4.0|This is a movie which could have been great, but was good nonetheless. A refreshing change (and relief) from action adventure, teenagers in love, special effects, or comedy romance. Rob Brown, who played Jamal, was so natural that it is incredible to believe that this was his first ever acting role. Either he's a natural, or else he just played himself!! Sean Connery, wonderful as always...and it was nice, for another change of pace....<br />However, the movie could have been great. Some of the moments were too cliched, and didn't need to be. Jamal losing the basketball game was a little bit much. That scene didn't even need to be in the movie. Also, I can't figure out why Forrester had to die. It made no sense. It could have ended right after the writing contest, when they say good-bye and Forrester takes off on his bicycle. And then maybe show his second book with the forward by Jamal...it just really annoyed me when they tack these...endings on for no reason at all. It nearly ruined the movie for me. And especially, when the lawyer told Jamal that Forrester had known for several years he had cancer--I thought the guy was a recluse and hadn't been out for the past 40 years. What did he do, have a hospital come to him? As far as I know, cancer usually can't be detected during a housecall...<br />All in all, a good movie, and I recommend turning it off right after the writing contest and when Jamal and Forrester say good-bye.
B0000025F7|5.0|This is the only Michael Jackson solo LP that I'm writing a review for since it best encapsulates my favorite genre of music: Pop/R&amp;B. Instead of just talking about how good the music is (just read the rest of the reviews for that), I'll attempt to provide some insight on just what makes 'Off The Wall' so special. Read on:<br />First of all, MJ wrote three of the songs on this album; two of them are among his greatest, and that says a lot about the sheer talent emerging from the 'Gloved One' at that point in time. They are: &quot;Don't Stop Till You Get Enough&quot;, &quot;Working Day and Night&quot;, and &quot;Get On The Floor&quot;.<br />Secondly, Rod Temperton wrote two of the other amazing tracks on this album; they are: &quot;Rock With You&quot; and the title track, &quot;Off The Wall&quot;. Temperton also wrote the closing track, &quot;Burn This Disco Out&quot; ; but please allow me to give a little background info on this underappreciated songwriter/producer.<br />Rod Temperton was part of a band called the Heatwave in the late 1970s, and they're best known for the hits &quot;Grooveline&quot; and &quot;Always and Forever&quot;. What's more, Rod Temperton also wrote &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot; and the ultimate Michael Jackson quiet storm ballad, &quot;Lady In My Life&quot;. Folks, I'm sorry, but this cat Rod Temperton is BAD...and it's about time someone gave him credit where credit was due. Thank you Rod, for blessing this album with your R&amp;B sensibility, and songwriting ability - you're awesome!<br />Thirdly, this was the first time Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson ever worked together on a full-length album - and at first Quincy didn't even want to do produce it! That's right, Q.J. had apprehensions about producing a &quot;pop&quot; record; but it worked. The pairing of then former child-star Michael Jackson with an accomplished composer like Quincy Jones was an odd one that proved to be the most amazing musical collaboration yet to take place: 1979's 'Off The Wall', 1982's 'Thriller', and 1987's 'Bad'.<br />Lastly, there's the music that really speaks for itself. Stevie Wonder's contribution, &quot;I Can't Help It&quot; is splendid, and for me it induces  visions of a nighttime magic carpet ride through a large city under a full moon. I actually liked &quot;Girlfriend&quot; written by Paul McCartney; it's playful, and I think it could easily be covered by today's pop/R&amp;B stars. The lone ballad on this album, &quot;She's Out Of My Life&quot; was decently covered by current R&amp;B singer Ginuwine in 1999, but the original is, well...better. Minimal filler tracks - if any, on 'Off The Wall'.<br />Thanks for reading...<br />Knyte.to take place: 1979's 'Off The Wall', 1982's 'Thriller', and 1987's 'Bad'.<br />Lastly, there's the music that really speaks for itself.

B000002HRE|1.0|After Load, I honestly wasn't expecting that much. Not that Load was a horrible album, it just didn't grab me like previous efforts. But really, this album has blown away all expectations!  ...Metallica should've left this ... unreleased and buried. What a horrid listening experience! Now I'm not saying it ... cause it isn't as heavy as Puppets, etc. It just ... because its a bad album! Bad songwriting, bad solos, bad performances, baaaaad! Stay away..PLEASE!
B00004YKUY|5.0|This new release is not your classic Journey. Don't get me wrong, it's good, some of the songs are really rockin', but it's different than you would expect. Steve Augeri does a great job on lead vocals, but believe me he is no Steve Perry. I do hear a voice similarity but I just think it's the classic note combination written by Neil Schon. There are two love &quot;ballads&quot; I believe that may become a hit. If you are a true Journey fan, you need to add this to your collection.
0671042858|3.0|I read this book from cover to cover on a two day road trip and there were times that talkin to my mother was more interesting.  Like all Stephen King books, there is some great imagery in there.  But it just doesn't have the edge that his really great books do.  Stephen King has proven that he has the ability to write a gripping story even though there is very little character interaction or scenery change (see Gerald's Game) but it just didn't happen in this book.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is the incredible band headed by (as he was called above) the \\"Insane genius\\" Maynerd James Keenan. The first song I had ever heard from Tool was Eulogy. This intense song has been so contreversial that I'm not sure I even can agree on what it's about anmore. This CD is one of  ym favorites and opens up your mind to a different world out there.<br />Hope you like it as much as I did
B000002BYD|5.0|Lets just say, watch Single Video Theory! ... you will appreciate this album so much more. At first Do the Evolution will bring you in, as well as Given to Fly. the later is likely one of the best songs on the album as well as one of PJs finest ever. And then you will be drawn to Wishlist; why do they fade out \\"I wish I was the radio song, the one you couldn't turn off...\\" still great though. But now let me suggest the songs that will grow on you and become something great. No Way- god i wish they would perform this one live! great lyrics, and i love the way it gets so eriee, ... Yeah! All those Yesterdays- a great way to end the album. Eddie comes across as a poet, and a ... good one for that matter.  There are others too: Pilate reminds you of Evacuation, MFC is great, especailly performed live after UNTITLED. Low Light is wonderfly nostalgic, and Brain of J is a hard rocking masterpiece. keep in mind that every other song kicks ... too. anyways, no yield has swapped places with vitalogy. buy yield.
B00005AAFT|5.0|Rammstein is back!  They promsied their fans a harder album, and I must say.... they kept that promised to a &quot;T&quot;!  These six East-German men are back to do it all over again!  <br />&quot;Mutter&quot; (means &quot;Mother&quot; in German) is by far the best Rammstein album yet.  Richard's guitar riffs are a lot harder and faster. Schneider's drumming is just awesome. No words can describe it!  Let's not forget Till and his amazing deep German voice!  It's still there, and Rammstein still has it!  <br />This album is a lot harder than the 1998 album &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;.   &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; was more melodic, and more sensative.  &quot;Mutter&quot; has some sensative songs, but mainly hard, blow your mind songs.  It's great!  This is a must own album, like I said it's just too awesome to say &quot;No&quot; to!

B00005AAFS|5.0|Rammstein promised their fans a much more harder album.  They kept their promise to their fans, and they kept it very well!  This album has it all.... from Richard's heavy and soft guitars riffs, to Till's rough, German voice.  <br />The guitar riffs are very fast through out the album.  Schneider's drumming is just awesome. No words can describe it. Till's voice is just awesome.  He still growls in that nice, deep German voice!  <br />&quot;Mutter&quot; is by far the best Rammstein album yet!  &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; was more melodic, while &quot;Mutter&quot; is more harder and faster without the sensativity!  This is a must to own!
B000056K04|4.0|Many &quot;real&quot; or &quot;true&quot; DMB fans will argue that the unreleased Steve Lillywhite-helmed CD is better than this.  Well, this is a &quot;true&quot; DMB fan (since '94) speaking, and I'm here to tell you that is not the case.  While some of the songwriting is stronger on the unreleased stuff, the Lillywhite material is too somber and morose and feels cold, as if the band wasn't really into it and was going through the motions.  &quot;Everyday&quot; is much livier, punchier, and warm.  They could replace &quot;Mother Father&quot; (weak songwriting and merely an excuse for Carlos Santana to jam) on this disc with &quot;JTR&quot; from Lillywhite and have a near perfect disc.  But &quot;Mother Father&quot; is the only disposable tune here.  People are upset that Glen Ballard was brought in to produce, feeling he is too commercial and too controlling.  But this is the CD the band wanted to make, and while it doesn't blow the unreleased material away, neither does it pale in comparison (as some would have you believe).  I do not recommend this for first time DMB listeners, though, because you'd be better off with &quot;Crash&quot; or &quot;Remember Two Things&quot; for a primer on this band's exceptional musicianship.  That said, &quot;Everyday&quot; is a strong disc that has been unfairly maligned.
B000002KB8|5.0|This is a great album , the very first album by black sabbath . it is surely one of their best. the first song is black sabbath which begins with church bells, the song has some of the best licks.this song gave an impression that sabbath were antichrist which is not true.the second is wizard with ozzy playing mouth organ ,tony almost makes the guitar speak, the song also has great drumming by bill.next is behind the wall of sleep which is good but not great. the best track of this album being n.i.b for  the excellent riffs by geezer and tony.the intro to n.i.b is a bass solo called bassically and the solos are kickass, tony proves he is the best guitarist in this world.the 4th  track is just jamming and a cover of ansley dunbar the song is warning .the song has a lot of jazz and solos a part of it has drum solo too.the last being a live favuorite wicked world a great song with excellent drumming. this album is a very integral part of any rockers collection as this being the first metal album.the songs of this album have been covered time and again.black sabbath,n.i.b and behind the wall of sleep,the wizard and a part of the song warning have been covered. the highlights of this album being 1)first metal album2)tonys guitaring and his solos 3)bills drumming on the wizard and wicked world 4)ozzy playing mouth organ5)geezers bass on n.i.b,warning6)ozzys voice in top form YES.so this album is a must not only for all sabbath fans but for all rock fans too. do buy it.
B000056N8X|2.0|This makes the 3rd Highlander I've seen (missed the second one), I've yet to be impressed. For your money you get something the length of two television episodes and with exactly the same format, lots more blood,greater violence and some nudity being the difference.I mean, the series had to have a lower budget than this thing yet it was still much better. Save your money watch the TV show if you can.
0804102988|2.0|Long and dreary, wordy and blurry. Not uninteresting in parts, but in order to capture an &quot;epic&quot; scope, Rutherford relies on widely disjointed episodes, fragmented and compromised by bad fiction and worse history. Run on sentences and poor syntax are hallmarks of this books style. I finished it just because I don't like to quit. On the other hand, my wife reads all of his books. Despite this, we have a sound marriage. Even she thinks his prose is long winded and bloated, but she is a first class Anglophile, and so feels she must defend this exercise in tedium. I think it is much too long, and I like Finnegans Wake!<br />Don't read the next sentences if you're going to read this book anyway. There is one continuing thread throughout the book. It peters out about 4/5ths of the way through. It just disappears. You follow the freakin' thing through hundreds of pages and there is no denouement. Just disappears from ken. For this alone, I hate this book.
0782008372|3.0|For the money, I'd say buy this one. It was the first and is still the best. The sound and picture may not be perfect, I don't remember, but they aren't bad and the story is certainly beter than the sequels made later on. I'm guessing this movie had the lowest budget of the four yet the story telling was much better, more sensible and not so weird. About all that I'd have redone was the part about the handwriting expert looking at several generations of Connor MacCleod's handwriting and pronouncing &quot;they're all the same man&quot;. That and the sword expert dating a few metal slivers just wouldn't happen. #3 is just a ripoff of this movie, barely anything to do with it, #4 has even less, #2?
B00004YKUY|5.0|As a previous reviewer mentioned - this is the 1st CD I've listened to in years that I can't get enough of. 15 GREAT SONGS.<br />Buy it, pop it in the CD player, hit track 13 (To Be Alive Again), put the top down and get ready to sing along at the top of your lungs! This is a KEEPER.
B00004KD1L|1.0|This is NON-STOP hard house.   Absolutely insane, wild and overwhelming beats.  This is the best CD in the world.
B000001E3L|4.0|Listen to track no.4 - 'forgot that love existed' to hear a supreme master of music at his best - i could hardly believe it was live, it was that good!! i'm only a recent convert to van's music but this is great - some not so good renditions in there but the good stuff is primo! this is a good buy.
0894803123|5.0|If you love Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream but cringe sometimes at the price, this book is for you.  I don't know how this would work with a hand spun maker but with the electric one I bought (Cuisinart ICE-20, its perfect every time.  Just the base recipe alone is worth making daily!!  WOW! My whole family can't believe how much this taste like the real thing.  I never had any ice-cream making experience before and now I can make awesome ice-cream for a great price.  Enough for the whole family (34 adults, 2 kids) for around $3-$4.  Great deal.  My cookie dough recipe was incredible.  Worth every penny and won't disappoint!!!
B0000025ZK|4.0|About Face was released in the 80's when alot of music sounded very processed and predictable. Guitars were over done with effect's like sterio chorus, compression, nasel distortions, very solid state as opposed to a natural tube sound that the 60's and 70's were so well known for. About Face has some element's of the 80's sound but i don't know any rocker that put an album out then that wasn't influenced just a little. What David Gilmore does on this album is what he does on every album he graces his presents on, MELODIC MADDNESS!! Whether it be OUT OF THE BLUE which bring's me to tear's, LET'S GET METEPHYSICAL incredibly haunting!! or the rocker ALL LOVER'S ARE DERRANGED (lyric's co written by Pete Townsend). About Face is an awesome album that has alot of diversity and some melodic gem's, give it a try, you won't regret it.
0446677450|1.0|Recent evidence that has come to light indicates the author presented made up stories.  The only wealth this person ever made was with this book. <br />This is a change from my earlier mistake of giving this book a good review.
0891416811|5.0|War history is best told by those that lived it and not those that have only studied it. This is a point once again proven in Currahee.  Donald Burgett tells his story of World War 2.  His time with the 101st airborne makes for a moving and dramatic tale.  The book overflows with the tales of his heroism and the courage of others.  While Burgett downplays the danger he faced just by his straight forward style, the reader cant help but be amazed as he continuously dodges bullets, hides from artillery, and jumps from low flying airplanes. <br />The book reads fast and is as entertaining today as the day it was published. It gives insight into the mind of a dedicated warrior and a glimpse into what must have faced those that fought  so courageously in WWII.  I highly recommend it for history buffs and for just about anyone that likes a good book.
B0000026DJ|5.0|I got into the Oils like most other Americans - hearing Beds are Burning on the radio.  Such a shame that this is the only exposure that most Americans have to what I have come to regard as the greatest rock band of all time.  This album caught my attention like no other album ever has - it was great music with a great message.  The music is powerful and complex, with words that inspire and guitar solos that make my soul soar.  In the 15 years since, I have since become an Oils fanatic.  Red Sails in the Sunset is a great album, so is Blue Sky Mine, but nothing is like Deisel and Dust - song after song is a winner.  Sell My Soul is my personal favorite.  I hope the Oils music inspires you like it has me. You can't go wrong buying this album
0385006896|4.0|Many people do not realize that Sherlock Holmes is really based on a real person!  When Doyle was attending medical school, one of his professors, Dr. Joseph Bell, could deduce the life of his patients by simple observation.  This seed eventually blossomed into Sherlock Holmes.<br />To begin with, we all know who he is and what he is about, but we can take the next step and actually read the stories behind the icon.  Most Sherlockians agree that it is best not to start with &quot;A study in Scarlet.&quot;  I think it is best to start with the collection &quot;Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,&quot; with the story &quot;A scandal in Bohemia&quot; then rad your way through several of the collations.  then you can go back and read &quot;A Study in Scarlet,&quot; and &quot;The Sign of Four.&quot;  Doyle's writing gets better as the stories progress, until you hit &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles.&quot;<br />AS been noted, Holmes becomes a bit of an addiction.  Doyle is that good of a writer.  As I said, everyone knows who he is, like  Tarzan, Elvis, or Madonna.<br />The only drawback is that some of Doyle's earlier stories can get a bit tedious and somewhat formulaic at times.  But the attraction is still there!<br />Yes, it is worth the money to buy the complete Sherlock &quot;cannon!&quot;
B0000584V3|5.0|I've listend to a lot of bands over the years, and all sorts of different music but this by far is my favorite cd. I love it and i drive a lot, so I listen to it all the time. Great cd, incourage you to buy it !!!! Its worth it!
B000002ADT|5.0|About 10 years ago when I was a jazz neophyte, I asked a longtime lover of jazz what he felt the best example of the genre was; he told me (without hesitation) that Kind of Blue was easily the best jazz album ever recorded.  I bought it that afternoon and have been thankful to him ever since.  This album introduced me to bop, and for that I will be forever grateful.  I am also grateful for this album for the piano part at the end of &quot;Blue in Green&quot; which still sends a chill up my spine every time I listen to it, thousands of times after hearing it for the first time.  Do not debate whether or not to buy this; just buy it and your life will be changed forever, for the better.
B00004U45G|5.0|Put this cd in and get ready to rock! Kudos to the Crowes and Page for covering some lesser known Zeppelin songs. One of the best live albums I've heard in a while.
B000002UJQ|5.0|There's only 2 things you can say when someone asks you about OK Computer.  You love it or you havent heard it.  How can anyone not be totally absorbed into the music on this album?  This album deserves to be compared to Dark side of the moon. (rolling stone predicts this album will go diamond by 2008!)  There is not one bad song on this album, it is completely flawless in every way.  If there were one album to recieve five stars this would be it.  My favorite track that stands out even more than the others is &quot;Climbing up the Walls&quot;.  It is definately the climax of the cd, with the greatest climax in the whole album.  The ones who say this is over rated have probably listened to the album only once or twice.  If your going to do that dont even bother getting this album.  No one likes radiohead on the first listen, because i didnt either.  This album is the zenith of Radiohead.  It is hard to repeat this good of music. Kid A was a masterpiece and groundbreaking, but this album IS the album to have.  I reccomend this album to anyone who has a good taste in music and doesnt mind spreading their music tastes.  One of the best albums of all time, no doubt.
0440211727|5.0|On a scale of 1to 10 I rate John Grisham's A Time to Kill a very enthusiastic 10.   Grisham is the absolute master when it comes to courtroom suspense.  He brought out a problem in America that most choose to ignore.  He also kept me turning the pages with the intrigue of A Time to Kill.  But the characters were my favorite part; Jake Brigance and Carl Lee Hailey were to die for.  A Time to Kill focused on the issue of racism in this country.   Throughout the whole book they compared whites to blacks.   It was said that if Carl Lee was white man and he killed two black men for raping his daughter, the killings would have gone unnoticed.   This book brought out the truth.  There are a lot of people who aren't racist, but there are a lot that are too.  Like there is still the KKK and people who disrespect people who are different them.   In the beginning the cased seem impossible to win, but Jin turns out alright.  I hope this book will help everyone see the truth.   I read this book in less then a week and it was a long book, but I couldn't put it down.  There was always something going on and to find out.  Grisham did a great job of keeping you interested.  The drama never stops.  The trial was the best part; you kept wondering what was going to happen tomorrow.  Every witness had something interesting to say.  Grisham definitely is the best at keeping all this law stuff interesting.  Jake Brigance had to be my favorite character, he was absolutely perfect.  A young lawyer facing a deadly problem in America.  He had all the skill to take the case, but not the reputation.  Carl Lee had my heart from the very beginning.  He was an inspiration to everyone.  Another one of my favorite characters was Jake's mentor Lucien who was supposed to be brilliant, but I thought he was funny.   Sandra Bullock's character named Ellen Roark didn't make an entrance in to the book until the third half.  I liked that better because that way she wasn't counted as a main character.  Anyway, I just loved all the characters.  They all seemed to fit together nicely by the end of the novel.  So I absolutely give A Time to Kill a 10 because it was brilliant and suspenseful.  It is now one of my favorite books of all time.  A highly suggest that people read it because it gives you different perspectives about the whole racist issue and I know don't anybody who wouldn't enjoy this book.
6305892806|5.0|This is a great movie.  If you're an Austen purist, then perhaps it's not for you, but i found it really delightful.  The characters have more depth and appeal than i found in Austen's somewhat dry, though interesting novel.  Many scenes are strikingly beautiful.  Watch this movie
B0000042BZ|2.0|This one will appeal to neophytes who uncritically swoon over Pavarotti's mannerisms and don't know any better. To call this poor &quot;performance&quot; of one of Verdi's great operas even &quot;adequate&quot; (except for Gruberova), much less &quot;great&quot;, is a sign to go back and do more listening. Avoid this turkey. Pavarotti is his post-70's below-par, trying-to-compensate-by-mugging worst. Wixell tries hard but is just not up to the role that was so superbly performed by Warren or Gobbi. Ponnelle's direction is bizarre (as usual).  For a better sung and more honest performance, I recommend the English National Opera video. Ok, it's sung in English and updated BUT the singing is superior on all counts, the translation is workable, and the updating doesn't violate the spirit of Verdi's drama.
6301208773|4.0|&quot;Die Hard&quot; was the film that made Bruce Willis a star, and it was a perfect action vehicle for him. His character, John McClane, is a cop who is getting home to his wife and kids for Christmastime, but ends up being trapped in a high-rise building led by terrorists, with Hans (Alan Rickman) as the leader. The result is a high-voltage action/thriller with funny one-liners, spectacular stuntwork, and tense action sequences. The highlight scene is where McClane straps a rope around him, jumps off the top of the building, and the building blows up real good. He then fires at the window of an office and jumps into the room. That is the most exciting (and scary) action sequence I've ever seen in an action film. It's been repeated countless times in other action movies, but it has never been equaled. During the end credits, they play the Christmas song &quot;Let It Snow&quot; and Beethoven's 9th Symphony &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;. The latter one also played in the ads and trailers for &quot;Die Hard&quot; before it was released in 1988. This is one action movie that has a whole lot going for it. Along with &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, it's one of the best action films of the '80s, if not THE best.
0425107469|5.0|What would you do if you knew that your dog was smarter than you?  In the case of Einstein the golden retriever, you wouldn't care.  Dean Koontz loves to write clever dog characters in many of his books, but here he has taken it one step farther.  He has created a dog character that has been genetically engineered to be as smart as (or even smarter, in some cases) a human being.  The dog is kind, gentle, and loving, while at the same time smart as a whip.  Of course, the book would be fine just detailing the adventures of the dog and its interaction with humans, but this being a Dean Koontz book, there are several other classic Koontz elements:  A long-suffering loner who believes everyone he loves dies, and is therefore afraid to love anyone.  A beautiful but painfully shy woman, who is of course brought out of her shell by the man.   A psychotic hired killer who believes he gets closer to invincibility each time he kills someone (not!).  A government agent struggling to do his job while wrestling his own personal demons.  And, of course, an evil monster that is equal parts the &quot;Alien&quot; from the movies and a werewolf, also created in the same lab as the dog and dedicated to the dog's destruction, as well as anyone that gets in its way.  Meshing this colorful array of characters together as he skillfully switches from one scene to another, Koontz has created a wonderful book that you will greatly enjoy reading again and again.
B00004STPT|5.0|this has got to be one of the best soundtracks ive ever listend to. every time i hear it, im watching the movie for the first time. All the tracks are good, #3 (The Battle) and #13 (Barbarian Horde) feature the upbeat soaring theme that will plop you back in the battle, and if you are in the mood for something more tragic/ slow, go for #6 (Patricide) for violins or # 14 (Am I Not Merciful?), which chokes me up every time i hear it. You cannot go wrong with this soundtrack! someone please remind me why it didnt win an Oscar?

B00003CWRX|4.0|A superb film about the high-stakes battle between a family man, Big Journalism and Big Tobacco.<br />Michael Mann is a master of the every day. In all of his films - and even his lone dip into tv, 'Miami Vice,' - Mann successfully captures that feeling of the routine, of driving home after a long workday, of sitting down to dinner with the kids. It is that realism sprinkled over every frame of this movie that makes it so enthralling. There is no Hollywood-ending here. In 'The Insider,' words and actions have consequences, sometimes dire. Marriages dissolve. Lawsuits are filed. Jobs are lost. (you get the picture). All of that adds to the depth of our protagonist, Mr. Gladiator himself Russell Crowe, whose intensity in this film is palpable. I highly recommend it.
B000056V73|5.0|This film is a love letter to rock music in the 70s and includes heartfelt performances from the entire cast.  I was particularly struck by Frances MacDormand's portrayal of the ever-patient mother, struggling to remain relevant to her kids during a time of family disruption.  The music is fun - the relationships are fun - and Cameron Crowe neatly ties up all the loose ends by the final credits - it's a good ride!  You'll enjoy it!
B00003CXRP|4.0|Magnificent film, and for one chief reason: Tom Hanks. Only Hanks could mesmerize an audience for 70-plus minutes all by himself. Only Hanks could pull it off: Stranded on a deserted island with nothing but sand, coconuts and FedEx packages to see him through. Only Hanks could shed pound after pound of body fat, and grow inch after inch of beard to look the part.<br />The truth is, this is not a story about being on an island. Rather, it is a case study in reclamation, in finding your niche all over again. Put it this way: We've all come home from long vacations, and then dragged ourselves back to the grind of every day life. It's that sublime emotion that stirs in your gut whenever you see your friends and co-workers for the first time after not having seen them in a while. This feeling of adjustment, of 'coming home' is Cast Away. Hanks portrays it well, and the superb, simplistic direction by Robert Zemekis gives it gravity.<br />In short, whatever you thought you might have heard or read about 'Cast Away,' chuck it out the airplane window... See the movie; view it by yourself on one of those rainy, snuggly nights, and you'll find yourself seeking 'home,' wherever that may be.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I ran into Rammstein by chance as they opened for Kiss in 1999 tour. I was just amazed by these guys. They don't sound like those silly alternative bands from the U.S. This is what Rock should be today!<br />These album delivers. You don't understand a word but the language ( German ) itself take you to a new musical dimension. The best track is for sure Links 2 3 4 with troops marching out as a background and powerful vocals that you will start thinking this guy is some Kaiser wanna be.<br />If Scorpions hadn't go Pop they would sound like Rammstein today.
0385474547|5.0|This is a great novel, introducing the reader to an alien culture during a difficult transition.  It is beautifully written, has realistic and vivid characters, and its ending is entirely unHollywood.  When you finish it, you will understand the economics of a Nigerian village, its codes of honor, and the confusion that comes with change.<br />With it, Achebe wrote one of the first great Third World novels, in which he expressed emotions and described lives that had no counterpart in Western literature.  In retrospect, we should never forget what a pioneering work this is:  Acebe spawned many imitators and many many worthy successors.<br />Highly recommended.
1573226521|5.0|I admit it, I loved this book.  I was riveted by the last 100 pages, so much so that I wanted to call in sick so I could sit out on my patio and read them.  Bully for a guy, Alex Garland,  only in his 20s when he wrote this, to be so skillful in writing such a suspenseful read.  OK, so it's not Tolstoy or Faulkner, but it sure is a heckuva lot of fun.
B000002UAU|5.0|The title track 5 stars, the second track 5 stars, the third track 5 stars... you get the idea.Is there really anybody out there who still doesn't own a copy of this?
6304595247|5.0|Until this film, I genuinely hated the story of Wuthering Heights! The reason being that I began reading the book so many times only to put it down because I hated Cathy and Heathcliff - they were so selfish, vain, and cruel. I thought I would give the story another shot and watched the 1939 Oberon/Olivier version. Olivier was overly dramatic and unbelievable in his role. I pitied him, but couldn't stand the glaring overacting of Olivier(in his first film since transferring from the stage...On top of that, the ending was utterly depressing. <br />So, when I saw this film at the rental store I almost passed it over - but my best friend and I were searching for a good chick flick. We decided to give it a shot and I'm so glad we did. I was very angry to learn that the 1939 film stopped in the middle of the story - it passed over the whole point of the book. I have amazing respect for the novel now and am glad that I rediscovered it through this mesmerizing film. Binoche is as hypnotic to watch as Audrey Hepburn and Fiennes is the perfect tormented soul, harboring unforgiveness and revenge in his heart like a disease. It is a tale of the heart and it's power to lift and sometimes destroy. As Paul Harvey would probably say when comparing this with the 1939 version, \\"and now you know the rest of the story....\\"
6305363668|5.0|I love this movie.  &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is terrific especially in the Director's Cut.  I liked the original theatrical version but I like the Director's Cut better.  I especially like that &quot;Tears in the Rain&quot; speech near the end and the opening is out of sight. This movie will stick with you for days and days after you're done seeing &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Not bad coming from a movie originally from 1982.  To this day, the dialogue, the beginning, the ending(the original version and the Director's Cut), the music from Vangelis, and everything else has stuck in my mind. I'm not obsessed with this movie if that's what you think.  I'm just saying some movies will stick in your head after you're done seeing them on video or in the theaters. &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is one of them.  The Director's Cut is awesome.
0441172717|5.0|I first read this book about 14 years ago when I was in high school.  Unfortunatly most of my junior high and high school years were spent reading sci/fi and fanasy books instead of living those wonder years. I wish that.....Oh Ok, lets get back to the book review.  I probably read hundreds of book during those teen years.  My favoriate place to go was the library.  I couldn't tell what most of those books I read were about or the names of most of those book, but I do rememeber what Dune was about.  This book is a epic story about religous beliefs, hallucinogenic visions, man overcoming nature, personal betrayal, and how the hardships of life and love make you stronger.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to look at life from a non-main stream cultural and religious prospective.  I think this is the best book of the Dune series.
B0000025HG|5.0|Wet is one of Barbra's many great albums, this one was released in 1979, hot off the heels of her Star is Born soundtrack. She was having hit after hit and its no surprise this album did as good as it did. The songs are remarkable. The album has an aquatic theme throughout, as each song encorporates water themes into each song. The title track is a really tender ballad, quite beautiful. On Rainy Afternoons and After The Rain are also beautiful songs you will love. The highlight though is the album closer, Kiss Me In The Rain, one of her best songs. No More Tears (Enough is Enough) is also on here, the duet with Donna Summer which was a huge hit. This is a must for Barbra fans.
B000002LN9|5.0|If you're a big Eric Clapton fan you should own this CD, if nothing more than for &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;. Talk about a song that can move you to the depths of your soul without ever saying word. When I think of that song so many words com to mind, POWERFUL, MOVING, INTRIGUING. It is truly Clapton at his best. He shows his true versatility on this one playing with an orchestra. Oh yeah, and the rest of the album's pretty good too.
B000003JDA|5.0|Best thing Tull has done since Heavy Horses. Harkens back to the seventies only much better. Anderson is brilliant on the flute and vocals seem effortless.Tunes that you will find yourself humming along with. A must have whether you are hardcore Tull lover or a casual listener.P.S. check out Andersons web site.
0440133688|4.0|Shem's book portrays the internship year as a chaotic adventure- an adventure full of success and failure, of self realization and self reprobation.  The book is exaggerated of course, and is very humorous in other areas, but hits on many important aspects of what is truly a &quot;trial by fire&quot;.  The lead character goes through many phases during the year, defining his own role as he discards them.  The insane hours put a strain on his relationships, and he begins to lose sight of who his is, only to come out the other side a wiser, and more competent doctor.  This, I guess, it the philosophy behind the internship year.  Put the individual through hell as a learning experience.  The book is a bit dated, marked by &quot;interhospital relationships&quot; that may seem shocking to the reader.  However, the pace and humor of this book makes it a must read for the fans of real life drama with imagination.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Well, you know the rest. That's the great thing about this movie, it's uplifting and entertaining. Makes you want to believe a man can fly (hence the tagline used in the original promotional campaign). And what this DVD does best is show you how they did that. Three full-length documentaries take you back to 1977, when there was no CGI and computer animation to create breathtaking stunts in mere days. Back then you had to do it with blue screens, wires, gimbals, some trick photography, and months of work (the film took two years to make), and still you had to cross your fingers that the result would turn out right. It's truly fascinating to see how different things were and how well they pulled it off. Other bonuses are the screen tests featuring actors such as Stockard Channing and Lesley Ann Warren reading for the part of Lois Lane, as well as a young and skinny kid named Christopher Reeve in his first screen test in the red and blue suit. The documentaries also feature present-day interviews with the director, special effects crew, and the actors. If you saw this movie when it was on TV in the early '80s you'll remember most of the additional 8 minutes of footage (including the &quot;gauntlet&quot; where Lex Luthor tries to shoot, burn and freeze Superman, to no avail). I do somehow remember some more scenes which are not here, such as Otis wiping his arm across his forehead and smearing the missle codes (which is why he messes them up) but two additional scenes are provided which are not integrated into the movie: Otis feeding Luthor's &quot;pets&quot; (whatever they are), and Superman rescuing Miss Tesmacher from same &quot;pets&quot; after saving Lois. The audio quality is incredible, and the video is crisp and clear (which, unfortunately, tends to highlight the limitations of the blue screen technique). The disc is double-sided, with the documentaries and screen tests on &quot;side B&quot; (although it is not so marked which can be annoying). Overall this isa great addition to any DVD collection.
0345350472|5.0|A very intriguing story that once you start reading, you just can't stop. Also recommend the soundtrack.
0451163516|4.0|Ken Follett has done it again!  The book is based in the early 1990's, the World War 1 as a backdrop. The protagonists are from Russia and England, two major players in the World War.  Along with giving an interesting insight, into the politics carried out by leaders and influential people in a nation, which ultimately go on to determine the fate of the whole world, it delves deep into the psyches of the main players - common people with emotions and weaknesses not different from yours or mine.  The best thing I liked about this book, is that the characters are so real.And there are no heroes or villains. You sympathise and empathise with each of the characters at various times as you read along.  With the narration being of such a high quality, I wondered how Ken Follett would manage an ending which would do justice to the story so far.  Ken Follett did not let me down.The ending could not have been better.
B000001Y5J|5.0|As pretty much everyone else has said about this EP, it is greatness, with a decidedly more straight up, rock out, industrial/grunge sound.  It also has some of my favorite lyrics (Happiness in Slavery) that Trent has written, and I think it shows him when he wasn't as cryptic and mature, and just more angry, violent, and cynical.  Like all NIN, you must buy to experience fully how engrossing and creative Reznor is.  You can't make snap decisions based on the little 20 sec. morsel of music they give you on this site.  So break the tightwad attitude and pick up a copy.  Let the songs grow on you, don't expect them to just immediately entertain your short attention span.  All great music requires the part of a listener who will think about what he's heard and try to understand it.

B00005A1PR|3.0|The thing I love the most about India is the fact that she's trying to be herself and not getting caught up the image thing. However, musically speaking there are other black female artists who've trod the acousti-soul path India is taking, most notibly Joan Armatrading and Tracy Chapman (but Ms. India is funkier than either). All and all, this is an enjoyable disc; I look forward to hearing more music from her after she 'suffers' a little more.
6302759110|5.0|In Bram Stoker's Dracula,Coppola returns to the original source of the Dracula myth,Vlad Tepes.Gary Oladman stars as Prince Dracula who grows from old to young,from man to beast-is nothing short of amazing.Winona Ryder stars as Mina Murray who becomes the object of Dracula's devastating desire.Anthony Hopkins costars as Van Helsing who dares to belive in Dracula,and then dares to confront him.Keanu Reeves costars as Jonathon Harker a reel Estate agent who gets held captive in Dracula's castle but then escapes to get to Mina.Sadie Frost brings the role of a young maiden named Lucy who becomes Dracula's first victim.Cary Elwes and Richard E.Grant also star.Opulent,dazzling,and utterly irresistible,this is Dracula as you've never seen him.And once you see BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA you'll never forget it!I think this film should be 13 and due to nudity,gore,and violence.
0425163407|3.0|This is my second Cornwell book, the plotline is great! But there were times that I got a little bored, and I think that's why I took so long to read it. I didn't think it was all that much thrilling. Another letdown was that the author didn't explain fully, how Dr. Scarpetta found some things out. There were some blank spots, that I just couldn't figure out. But overall it was not such a bad book.
6300182193|4.0|Even though this movie was very dramatic and sexy this movie was very cool.Very different from Bram Stoker's novel but still a good movie.11 and up do to adult behavior and violence.
1878424319|4.0|I was surprised by this little book.  I found most of the stuff between the covers to be unnecessary, gleaning just the 4 agreements.  I think this is good stuff for anybody to do on a daily basis.  It can certainly help 'unclutter' your life.  And it certainly isn't going to hurt.  Basically just good sound advise most people ought to know anyway.  To a lot of people this would be considered a 'woo woo' book.

0440236304|5.0|I read this book in a 4 hour layover recently.  It is thrilling, it is terrifying, it is bloody, it is the invasion of Normandy through the eyes of a paratrooper.  This book is as much a look into the battle as it is a glimpse into the mind of a young man superbly trained to be a remorseless killer, a soldier's soldier.<br />Probably the most terrifying moment in the book for me was when Mr. Burgett's MG loader took a round in the head with a &quot;plock&quot; sound. The emotional distance Mr. Burgett expresses over the death of his comrade (friend) is astonishing. The general acceptance of death as an inevitable part of combat, a truly casual acceptance of it are never expressed but clearly evident. This is no coincidence since you've already read about Mr. Burgett's training to become an elite paratrooper. There are bayonet charges, paratroops dying in droves, firefights at the distance of mere yards, this book captures the unreality of what a combatant experiences and unleashes one upon the another.<br />This book is a quick and easy read that you'll never forget.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is simply excellent!  I was captivated in the theatre and have since purchased the DVD and watched it several times!  This DVD won't dissapoint and I would suggest purchasing it to everyone!
B00005AXEL|4.0|Stevie Nicks is back with her solo career on top.  &quot;Trouble in Shangri'La&quot; is a strong effort.<br />If I had to put all of her solo efforts together I would have to say that &quot;Bella Donna&quot; from 1981 is her best album to date.<br />Though this album gives you back the Nicks we missed with &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot;, &quot;Bombay Sapphire&quot;, &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; and Sorcerer&quot; as some of the strongest cuts on the album.<br />The production and Nicks raspy vocals are at there strongest coming into the new century.<br />This is a very good album from beginning to end - but of course I am comparing it to her classic &quot;Bella Donna&quot; and I have to take off 1 star due to some filler songs like &quot;Everyday&quot;, and &quot;I Miss You&quot;, however still a very strong CD that will be playing on my machine for quite sometime.

B00005AFVR|3.0|If this CD came from any other artist the title would be \\"fulfilling my contractual obligations.\\" With the exception of Tom Joad,  Bruce Springsteen recently has only released \\"Greatest Hits\\" cd's with a few  songs as \\"new material\\" in this case the very surreal 41 shots, a homage to Amado Diallo who was accidentally killed by New York City police officers.  As an avid Springsteen fan I was disappointed to say the least in this latest 2 CD live  \\"Best of \\" compilation.<br />The cd's were culled from material from his last 2 shows at Madison Square Garden after a long tour, and it shows. The musicianship while tight sounded very tired and if you by chance seen the requisite video on HBO you can see that they look tired.  But the CD is not terrible; it is after all the Boss.  It opens with a very rocking `My love will not let you down' one of only a few high points. The CD heads downhill with `Two hearts, Mansion on the hill and a very disappointing version of Atlantic City, one of the few songs that is not a mainstay of his \\"greatest hits\\" work. We move on to a very long version of  `The River' with Clarence providing the Sax work, this song although one of Springsteen's best in terms of lyrics, sounds tired and bored, bringing visions in my mind of the Beach Boys way after their prime playing Vegas and plodding through their surfer song catalog. Another of the few high points is the electrified version of `Youngstown' from the Tom Joad CD.  As an added unlisted in the credits bonus we get `Born to run' the version he chooses surprised me because on the Jersey dates of the tour he played the acoustic version which feels more heart felt, this version just sounds like all the others. On CD 2 we get a long rambling `evangelistic' version of 10th ave. freeze out, which makes you long for the story telling aspects of his live shows of the past where he tries to form this bond with the audience, who can't forget his \\"turn down that damn guitar\\" story from his Live 75/85 CD. He gives us a very bluesy version of Born in the USA and a decent version of `Jungleland' finishing off the CD with `Ramrod' and letting Little Stevie warble on  `If I Should Fall Behind'. <br />If you're a true Springsteen fan you already own Live 75/85 so I would pass on this CD and just download `Youngstown' &amp; `Lost in the flood' from napster.

B00003CXBK|5.0|As I watch the DVD for the millionth time, I remember just how much I love this movie. Over the years I've hated how saccarine and sappy feature cartoons have become in America.  I guess part of it's due to culture; people have a hard time believing that something animated could have meaning, depth, and not be for the entertainment of three year olds.  Thank goodness for Japanese animation! I'm NOT a fan of the dubbed version of the movie (or of any anime). Having watched the subtitled AND dubbed version, I find that even the script of the Japanese version is superior. The American version seem to be a &quot;dumbed down&quot; version. Example dialogue - American version: Is this soup or donkey piss? Japanese version: This soup tastes like hot water. Arrrgh!! Talk about taking liberties in translation. I won't go further into the details, rent/buy the DVD and see for yourself. The voice actors in the dubbed version just don't have the depth and range of the Japanese voice actors. The plot follows a general man vs. nature plot that Miyazaki is fond of portraying in his movies.  For an animated movie that doesn't have dancing/singing/cutesy animals(quite the opposite!^_^) and a wonderful story, watch Mononoke Hime!
B00003CXIY|5.0|&quot;Road Trip&quot; is one of those movies to watch ONLY if you are in the mood for some comedy.  Yes, some of it is &quot;gross humor&quot;, but that is Tom Green in a nutshell.  I know I have never laughed this hard except for during &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;, which still ranks as my favorite comedy.  This movie, however, IS funnier than &quot;American Pie&quot;, although it never received the accolades that &quot;American Pie&quot; did.  <br />Seann William Scott is a rising comedic talent, and is just hilarious in this movie as E.L.  His lines and facial expressions are just great.  &quot;What am I going to do...stay here and learn?&quot; is one of my favorite lines.<br />D.J. Qualls is also quite funny as the skinny white boy with the orange Atari shirt.  Lastly, Amy Smart is a cutie-pie playing the role of Beth.  Watch this movie...you won't regret it!
B000056V73|5.0|Almost Famous is a perfect movie.  This is a very bold statement, I know.  I probably won't be able to back the statement up in a few sentences.  You will have to watch Almost Famous to see for yourself.<br />Cameron Crowe has always been my favorite movie writer/director.  Say Anything.  Singles.  Jerry Maguire.  And now, Almost Famous.  Crowe has an amazing ability to give his characters down to earth personalities.  From the way they give their lines to the expressions on their faces, it is as if the actors in Crowe's films go to &quot;The Cameron Crowe School for Acting&quot; before filming.  What makes this aspect of his films interesting for me is that each film is very different from the last, even though they are similar on many levels.<br />Kate Hudson, Bully Crudup, Patrick Fugit and all the actors were perfectly cast.  Kate Hudson seems to be a natural.  She handled the character of Penny Lane like a pro.  Her facial expressions, the ways she moved and positioned her hands, and her laugh, made Penny Lane seem like an innocent yet mysterious and experienced groupie.  <br />I would like to give special props to Fairuza Balk.  Even though the part was small, Fairuza's Sapphire was a great addition to the film.  I love the scene in which William's Mother called the hotel and Sapphire spoke of what a great boy William was.  Fairuza seems like an old soul, perfect to play a groupie from the 70's.  She reminds me of my Mother's old hippy friends from when I was a kid. <br />The soundtrack...PERFECT.  The Who, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Led Zep...and Cameron (or whoever chose the music) picked all of my favorite songs!!  <br />I have not been so in love with a movie like this since... I can't even remember.  One question: Where was Eric Stoltz?
0783233477|5.0|This movie has what many lack...heart.  Yes, it is long, and I'm sure there will be many complaints about that.  However, it is not too long, but actually just the right length of time to develop the story AND keep the viewer's interest.<br />The acting is formidable, especially by Hopkins.  His character truly does posess many qualities that the average person should strive for...a commanding leadership and presence, honesty, sincerity, love for his friends and family, intelligence, and respect.  Hopkins portrays this character with both flair and subtlety, which is not an easy task to pull off.<br />Pitt gets stuck with an even more imposing task while trying to pull of the character of Death.  Overall, I think he does just fine in a tough role.<br />Forlani is just beautiful, and it is just so easy to fall in love with her in this movie...I know I did.  Her tenderness and loving nature only reinforced her beauty.  None of her films since have been able to drive me crazy about her the way this one does...<br />Most important, and sometimes overlooked, is the chemistry that these actors had on stage together.  They worked extremely well together.  What more can I say...&quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; is a fine movie that most will enjoy.  Oh yeah, and the sets and scenery (especially that of the mansion) were phenomenal.  Go watch it if you haven't seen it yet.  Watch it again if you have...
630027120X|3.0|while &quot;the mission&quot; is indeed a good movie one must look at it from an informed point of view.  the movie offers an EUROCENTRIC point of view.  not once are there any subtitles which would allow the audience to know what the guaran are saying and thinking.  the aesthetic quality of the film is superb but i would argue that it derails the audience from questioning the actions of the europeans against the guaran.  the 'forgiveness' scene quite frankly made me want to puke...it was very unrealistic.  the audience is expected to believe that the guaran, now being 'good' christians can easily forgive robert deniro's character, rodrigo, for killing untold numbers of their people.  one thing i found quite unbelievable is that besides the opening scene there is not one other instance where any sort of resistance against religion or any other sort of european influence is shown by the guaran which makes them seem docile and puts them under the european's feet.
630264366X|3.0|. . .all the more exciting because it's a (mostly) true story.<br />Let's begin with the cast.  Gregory Peck, Christopher Plummer and Sir John Gielgud all together in the same movie?  Just this cast alone would be enough to recommend this movie to most people.<br />And the filming?  On location in Rome and the Vatican.  Doesn't get much better than that!<br />Drama?  Yes, it's there.  Suspense?  In SPADES!  Pathos?  Yup!  Humor?  Believe it or not, yes!<br />This movie, based on the true story of an Irish cleric in the Vatican will have you sitting on the edge of your seat.  The ending will have you cheering and crying and shocked, etc.  You will run the full gamut of emotions when viewing this film.<br />The only major difficulty? The &quot;politically correct&quot; portrayal of Eugenio Pacelli, aka Pope Pius XII.  For me, a trained historian, this was a major flaw.  The film's presentation of Pius was that of a weak man, unable to do much of anything, while the facts of the matter were quite different.<br />Regardless, though, this movie does rate as a &quot;must see&quot;.
B00004SAJK|2.0|I guess anyone who rate this album five stars never heard UFo in their heyday, when Michael Schenker was the guitar player. THe band in this album is: Phil Mogg-v; Paul Chapman-g; Neil Carter - g.k; Pete Wae - b; Andy Parker-d. Chapman is not a bad guitarrist, but he cannot bem compared with Schenker. 'Chapman is just average at best. Carter was already a famous &quot;rent-a-musician&quot; when joined UFo. Added nothing to them. The mediocrity of this &quot;MECHANIX&quot; is so astonishing you cannot believe it is the same UFO that recorded &quot;STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT&quot;, for example.
0780631684|2.0|There were moments in this film where there was some signs of intelligence and imagination, but they would quickly fizzle, and I was left with the same old movie.  I think the main problem I had with the movie was the basic premise, that the time of your death was fated, and there was no way to avoid it.  While in a sense this is true, because death does eventually have to come to all of us, it was the way that this movie portrayed it that I thought was stupid.<br /> In a basic nutshell, the movie's plot is as follows, seven people are kicked off an airplane just before it takes off because the lead character has a premonition of the plane exploding shortly after it takes off.  The plane does blow up, and the seven people are spared, but then, starting shortly afterwards, they begin dying off anyway, and under mysterious ways, as if since they cheated fate at that moment, they have to pay for it by dying now.  Maybe if this were displayed as merely accidents, I could have swallowed this premise, but in the very first death, we're shown that fate is truly killing these people off because they escaped their original death.  Very farfetched, and dumb.  To illustrate, a spoiler follows where I will illuminate the first death so you know what I'm talking about.  The first character to die is in the bathroom looking into the mirror when water mysteriously begins leaking from the toilet's pipe.  It slowly flows across the floor to where he's standing, holding a sharp pair of scissors that he's using to clip his nose hairs.  We are spared this death as he puts them down, then reaches to turn off the stereo, but he doesn't get electrocuted either.  Next, he goes over to check on socks that are drying on a clothesline across the bathtub when he slips in the water, falls on the line, it wraps around his neck, and he falls into the tub.  The other end of the line stays attatched above him as he knocks over a contained of shampoo into the tub, making it slippery so he can't stand up.  Thus, he strangles to death, and then the water seeps back across the floor to disappear back into the pipe, as if it were never there.  Fate, right?  Some of the other deaths were even dumber than that one, if you can believe it.<br /> So, the rest of the movie, the other characters work at trying to figure out how their death is coming and how they can avoid it.  Some of the actors were actually decent in their roles, but could only do so much with the script they were saddled with.  With some more imagination and a decent script, something might have actually have been salvaged from this film, but as it was, it really wasn't worth my time, nor do I think it is worth yours.  Oh, and to top it off, the usual reversal ending is thrown in, where when you think it's all finally over, everything turns right back around and comes back at you again.  Wow, I never saw that before!  Give this movie a miss.
0385335482|5.0|I have never laughed as much as I have while reading this book. Thank you Sophie Kinsella for such a funny and entertaining novel, and I can't wait for your next one.
0679879269|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read.  It is so realistic, I sometimes feel it has really happened, and I want to be part of it.  It is so original and new, I have read few books that I have been addicted to like this one.  A book you never want to end.  The story of Will and Lyra is touching and deep. Pullman writes in a way of his own and expresses everything perfectly.  A good end to an amazing trilogy.  Definately worth reading.
B000000W6F|4.0|The debut album of the Smashing Pumpkins, Gish, has an almost god-like presence with its sensational sounds that almost seem fated. The CD launches into full throttle right from the start with the hit single *I Am One*, which mostly has guitar riff yet still has a very strong presence. This lead very nicely into *Siva*, a song which has a big, intense resonance that grabs and holds you. Its haunting guitar solo reminds me of the powerful guitar solos that popularized Jimi Hendrix and Led Zepplin. *Siva* begins with a rockn' sound that finds a niche within you, then slows down and leads into the slight vocals of BillyCorgan, then pulls you back with a booming conclusion that throws you into your seat!  The next song, *Rhinoceros*, shows very good song variation, in that it has a more suttle and intimate melody, and because it is a sharp contrast from the first two. Then comes, yet another great song, and my personal favorite, *Bury Me*. This song opens with a rhythmic intro, then suprises you with an earth shattering cry of &quot;Hey love&quot; x2. It then goes into an adrenaline pumping guitar-percussion, that I can only describe as the Mission Impossible theme on acid. There are many other phenominal songs on this CD, but the only other one I will mention is *Tristessa*. With a vast acoustic sound and verse that is so empowering it seems to be an anthem for which is the heart of all of the Smashing Pumpkins. Quite honestly, this album can be ranked right next to The Mellon Collie on the list of S.P.'s best. This was the Cd who difined who they were to the world, and launched them into stardom right from the begin.......**GISH**.

B00000JNGG|4.0|Slipknot is a really cool band. Their beats are fast, and thegritty guitars make you want to [party]. Parents be warned, though. this ain't 'N SYNC. they've got a very violent set o' lyrics here. They definately deserve the PARENTAL ADVISORY EXPLICIT LYRICS that's printed on the cover of their CD.But,beyond the lyrics are some really cool  beats, and some relly great music. Slipknot blends thrash metal with rap and even some punk. So if you like hard music, and roaring vocals, Slipknot is for YOU.
630575067X|2.0|OK --- let's see how many 'Star Wars' fans I can upset here. I thought the whole thing was a waste of effort, time and money. I enjoyed the original 'Star Wars' - it was fun to watch, good entertainment. But this was just dire. The lead actors (McGregor, Neeson et al) were completely wasted in a script as flat as cardboard. The SFX were impressive at times, but even that failed to save a film that I would consider a chore to rewatch. There is nothing of the liveliness and gung-ho sense of adventure of the original. The whole thing is lacking in excitement and good humour. Spend your hard-earned dollars on something else.

B00000IBRI|2.0|Alright I'm a big fan of the guy, but Phenomena just didn't impress me. The acting was pretty bad, the story just doesn't make much sense, not a lot of his cool shots, not a lot of gore until the end and it has a monkey smarter then everybody else. But there was a couple of cool scenes throughout the film. I guess the story was my main problem, just didn't buy it, but it might be your cup of tea.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This 'spoof' on the South and Homer's Oddysey just made me giggle from start to finish.  I just saw this movie in the theater, and I can't wait for the DVD.  I rarely purchase movies, but this one is a 'keeper', to be run and rerun for those days when my spirits need a boost.  The music is delightful, the plot is a hoot, and the general consensus of those I know who have seen it is that it should not be missed.  Don't pass it up  - you'll be sorry!
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido has something amazing to offer. This CD is essential for any &quot;Roswell&quot; (the WB TV series) fan, but goes beyond that. She brings a soulful, sometimes sorrowful, and always emotional sound that is just plain cool. If this CD was a movie the reviews would say &quot;Hip, Sexy, and Powerful... Two Thumbs Up!&quot; I recommend it!
B000002TYX|4.0|The Beatlemania phase of the anthology also contains &quot;Free As A Bird,&quot; which, if nothing else, proved that the Beatles (or at least the production crew at the modern-day Apple) can add videos to the laundry list of things they do better than anybody else.<br />Already included on the list: Singles, albums, drum solos, close harmonies, Pop song writing, Popstar movies, personal fashion, grotty nude photography, and kazoo solos.<br />Beatle collecters already have a lot of these recordings on their shelves in bootlegs, but I'm glad to have clean, sanctioned CD versions of &quot;Sheik Of Araby&quot; and &quot;Cry For A Shadow,&quot; among others, available here.  <br />What is most interesting to note is the sudden shift in energy (not tempo, which so many young bands mistake for energy) between the first 23 tracks and everything that comes after that.  Beginning with &quot;Please Please Me&quot; the Beatles turn some corner, and everything is different from there on out.<br />And for Americans like me who realize that we got 95% of the Beatles greatness but still hunger for the 5% that was only available to UK audiences prior to Ed Sullivan, check out tracks 30-34. Anybody who wants to downplay the Beatles early stuff as bubblegum will have to admit that this was a band that cooked, just cooked.<br />Lennon said &quot;What we generated was fantastic when we played straight rock, and there was nobody to touch us in Britain.&quot; I can't think of anybody in the States who was playing like this in '62 or '63 either.
B000000WA4|1.0|One listen to this man's horrible voice and you know its a disaster. People's affection for this over hyped under devilered mess is beyond me. First off, his voice is weak, horrible, off-key, annoying and unable to express any emotion what-so-ever.  The songs themselves are at the most barely catchy. I suppose if one wanted to write songs that were most complex and less straight forward that would be good, that is obviously not the case here. He wants to write songs and play them yet his guitar skills are average at best. The songs don't have any punch to them at all and you can't hum these things. No melody, no groove, no reason. This is just another horrible POP(ular) band from the 90s with poor music skills (which is all too common among the mainstream. One last thing 'Alternative Music' is a market name for POP. This band is Pop and its powerless.
B000002U82|5.0|You've heard and heard and heard that DARK SIDE OF THE MOON is a masterpiece of recording and production.  That's true.<br />Often overlooked in the discussion are the immaculate and passionate playing, and the inspired songs, with lyrics that sound as much like Charles Dickens as anything else.<br />I imagine DARK SIDE OF THE MOON and SGT PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND are the two CDs bought first by new CD-player owners.  They are similar in that they were produced by geniuses, played and written by masters, and present a complete fictional worlds that listeners are drawn into so strongly that they cannot easily be forgotten.
0805047905|5.0|My daughter has read several books to her newborn daughter since her birth.  At age 6 weeks, my grand-daughter began to react positively to this book and coos and talks to it.  It is the most amazing thing. She has two favorit pages and becomes visibly excited when they appear.  If she sees the book on the sofa, she will even become distracted while nursing. I highly recommend this for all newborn mommies who believe in reading to their infants.
B000003TAW|5.0|If you only know Weezer from what you've heard from the radio, boy are you missing out.  Granted, \\"Buddy Holly\\" and \\"Undone - The Sweater Song\\"  are great pop/rock tunes, but you really need to hear the rest of this CD to understand the genius that is Rivers Cuomo.  Years after they were considered material for the \\"Where Are They Now\\" file, Weezer surprisingly found out just how important they really were to rock music after only two albums (this debut and the follow-up \\"Pinkerton\\").  There are a ton of underground bands all over the world playing music called emo, and a huge chunk of them owe a debt to Weezer.  Some for a musical influence and others for borrowing lessons in how to sing songs about love without sounding contrived or just plain silly.  As far as the track listing is concerned, \\"My Name Is Jonas\\" was the absolute best way to start this CD with.  Those dynamics will hook you immediately, and whether you want to or not, you'll be nodding your head to the beat before the first thirty seconds are over.  \\"No One Else\\" is nothing if not a direct descendant of the Descendents... by way of the Beach Boys, but it's still one of my favorites here nonetheless.  \\"The World Has Turned And Left Me Here\\" is a trodding anthem for those who have lost at the game of love - you really start to feel sorry for the guy before it's all over with.  \\"In The Garage\\" is a light-hearted suburban life ditty, again, Descendents style.  \\"Surf Wax America\\" picks up the pace and is one of the more upbeat, rocking songs.  \\"Say It Ain't So\\", yet another radio-friendly- thus-radio-abused tune is an irresistible heart-wrenching riff-fest that you can't help but to sing along with.  And don't forget the air-guitar, too... you know you'll want to, especially with that chorus.  This guy's hurting inside, but strangely you almost feel grateful because of the fact that all his abject misery sure does inspire some awesome songs!  The tension releasing &quot;Holiday&quot; is perfectly placednear the end to lift spirits a little, while &quot;Only In Dreams&quot; is a lengthy roller-coaster epic journey through modern rock at a laid-back pace... the perfect ending to a wild ride that would torment and then lift the spirit of anyone bold enough to pay attention.
078322706X|1.0|The only thing that truly shines in this remake of \\"Death takes a Holiday\\", is Marty Brests' insufferable ego and his apparent belief that each frame of this film is pure genius and should remain untouched and unedited. The camera lingers and lingers and lingers on reaction shots to the point of being tedious and ultimately meaningless. <br />To those who suggest this film is well paced, stimulating and does not drag, I would like to point out that a bright spot on one's shoe can also be highly entertaining.... hours of fun in fact!<br />Ok, now that I have distracted all the people who saw and actually liked this movie, for a while, let me talk to the rest of you. <br />This movie is only for insomniacs and hard core Pitt/Hopkins fans ONLY. Both actors do fine job, but the movie is still a total waste of time. Forlani manages to emote a total range of 3 different expressions  (all she needs in this movie, but she is an actress capable of a great deal more).<br />&quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; is sure to spark theological disscussions the likes of which have not been seen since &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (a far superior film, watch it twice and skip Joe Black).<br />On the more positive side, this film loses nothing in the TV version. If this movie were cut down to 120 minutes from it's present 181 minutes, it would still be two hours too long.
0790733226|5.0|I feel like Contact is a gift to humanity from astronomer Carl Sagan.  It's an incredibly moving story about a scientist who lives out a scenerio that has played out in the minds of real life dreamers like myself.  The ultimate &quot;what if...?&quot;.  Indeed, what if THEY (E.T.'s) contacted US (Earthlings).  Director Zemeckis does an excellent job of transferring novel to screen.  &quot;Too long&quot; say some critics.  No way!  Perfect.  Things play out quite well.  The &quot;backing into space&quot; opening sequence is probably my personal favorite of all time.  I'm thrilled to live in a time when movie makers can create such magic.  It's worth the price alone to see the first few minutes of this film.<br />The cast is very good with Jodie Foster and John Hurt standouts.  Foster is as good in this as she was in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  She has moments of pure magic...I get misty eyed.  And John Hurt's &quot;Wanna take a ride?&quot; is my favorite character.<br />The DVD transfer is one of the best in my collection.  The picture and sound are excellent.  If you're into 2001 A Space Odyssey and the like, then Contact should be on your shelf.
B000002J1I|5.0|Tormato, I haven't heard it since it came out, some years ago.  It like every album ever done by Yes is superb.  Some people I know will disagree with me, but then I'm a die hard Yes fan.  Like every album they have released there is something important for them to say &quot;Don't Kill the Whales&quot;.  Yes does it in their completely mystical, fantasical way.  Every note, bar, and riff explodes and gently falls back like snow.  I love this album, but then... I LOVE YES!!!!!!!!!!

1565114582|4.0|This is a wonderful product.  Having said that, if you're considering buying either the audio product or the book, by all means buy the book!  I own both, and while the audio product is very useful for a busy new mom (you can listen while feeding your baby, for instance), this is a *very* abridged version of a book that contains too much valuable information to miss.  This is definately a reference book, and you'll want to mark pages to refer back to many, many times - not an easy task with an audio product.<br />The information in this book isn't perfect, in my opinion, but the useful information far outweighs the \\"questionable\\" information, which is for the most part just a matter of opinion or convention.  I find it interesting that most of the people who have given negative reviews of this book fall into one of two categories:  1) serious attachment parenting proponents and 2) people who are more interested in any scandals regarding Ms. Hogg's supposed parenting flaws.  ... people ...have taken the information and used it to make a difference in the lives of themselves and their babies. <br />I spent a month trying to follow attachment parenting techniques, and while I still admire Dr. and Mrs. Sears and think their book \\"The Baby Book\\" has the best, most complete information on baby health available, I found it difficult and stressful to implement their bonding strategies.  I found myself paranoid that if I put my baby down to entertain himself for any length of time I was damaging his little psyche and being a \\"bad parent.\\"  I found the Baby Wise information a little too rigid, and although Ms. Hogg's techniques are similar they are more flexible and more respectful than the Baby Wise techniques.  <br />I also appreciate Ms. Hogg's balanced views regarding making the decision whether or not to breastfeed.  She made it very clear that breastfeeding is best for the baby (and who could deny this), but this isn't a perfect world and not every mom can breastfeed exclusively for six or more months and remain sane.  As someone told me when I was in a state of distress over making the very difficult choice to discontinue breastfeeding, \\"Your baby needs a whole mother - not just a pair of breasts!\\"<br />What \\"Secrets of the Baby Whisperper\\" did for my baby, my husband and myself was give us just enough structure to enable us to live a balanced life during these first few stressful months with our new baby. ...

0345440757|3.0|Tracy's english style provided a few chuckles in addition to some good insight. Her EASY plan makes sense and is similar to BabyWise's Eat, Play, Sleep. Her tips to for sleeping helped me create a positive routine for my 7mo son -- it was simple and it works most of the time.<br />You can not rely on just one book for baby care answers -- you need a few to to pick and choose the info that is right for you and your child. No one solution fits all. I would recommend this book to add to your personal collection, especially as a new parent.
B000020617|4.0|When I first bought this cd, I thought it was gonna be like thier debut album. It's not. See, I had only heard the \\"Learn to Fly\\" song off it, which is probabaly one of the best songs on the LP, so I thought the rest of the cd was gonna be like that one song. They're not. <br />But in my mind, the first song \\"Stacked Actors,\\" was hilarious, thoughtful & one of my faves. \\"Breakout,\\" Gimme Stitches,\\" & \\"Learn to Fly\\" are all the other good ones. The rest 'pretty' much [aren't very good]. {I'm trying to be honest here.} It's not Nirvana and it's not early FF. Instead it's a catchy, mellow, & experimental. If you're cruisin for a rock record, this ain't your pick. If you're a die-hard Foo-fan, and haven't purchased this already, go ahead & get it.
B000002GXX|5.0|Is it true that a band's best record is the best-known one? &quot;One Of These Nights&quot; is far less famous than &quot;Hotel California&quot;, and yet I think that the Eagles' best album is &quot;One Of These Nights&quot;. After having cut three records, I consider &quot;One Of These Nights&quot; to be most accurately representative of the band's maturity. As it goes, &quot;Hotel California&quot; would only be a kind of follow-up to that maturity. And I wonder, is there any song in &quot;Hotel California&quot; that is better than &quot;Lyin' Eyes&quot; or &quot;Journey Of The Sorcerer&quot;? Is there any song in &quot;Hotel California&quot; that conveys a greater sensitivity than &quot;Hollywood Waltz&quot;, &quot;After The Thrill Is Gone&quot;, &quot;Take It To The Limit&quot; or &quot;I Wish You Peace&quot;? Is there any song in &quot;Hotel California&quot; with a deeper rockin' feel than &quot;Visions&quot; or the title track?<br />These are the main reasons why I believe that all the good things contained in &quot;Hotel California&quot; can already be found in &quot;One Of These Nights&quot;. To me, this album is more original and the group was not so lost in success. Because, after all, what good stuff did The Eagles cut after &quot;Hotel California?
B00003CXN4|4.0|This is a good movie.  The movie tells the stories of different characters and families on the opposite sides of the drug war.  The movie tells a comlex story in a very understandable manner.  However; the story is not new.  I think around 15 years ago, when I was still living in Montreal, BBC made a TV series with the same story line.  The location has now been changed from London to Washington, from Pakistan to Mexico. I can still remember the series because it made a tremendous impression on me when it was first broadcasted.  The way the BBC series was shot was more conventional, like a BBC series.  It was very well done.  The new movie now is shot with more updated technique.  If I must chose between the two - I prefer the BBC series.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Like most everyone else, I think \\"TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA\\" is the best, and most complete, album Stevie Nicks has recorded since 1981's \\"BELLA DONNA.\\" Unlike most people, though, I think it's even better than her solo debut. While \\"BELLA DONNA\\" was the ultimate in studio sheen perfection, it lacked the depth and warmth and humanity that just exudes from \\"TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA.\\"  Mind you, as a life-long Nicks fan, I had just about given up on her after 1994's lackluster \\"STREET ANGEL\\" and the disasterous tour that accompanied it. That's why I'm so happy to see her come roaring back in such fine form. So, sit back and enjoy this review.....like Julia Roberts at the Oscars, I'm taking my time with this one; \\"TROUBLE...\\" is such a strong release that the only way to approach it is as a complete package, song by song!  Opening the CD is the smooth, silky title track, with it's slightly haunting chorus of \\"I run through the grass/I run over the stones (in those boots?!?)/Down to the sea\\" and it's chilling lyrics (\\"You can consume all the beauty in the room, baby/I know you can, I've seen you do it\\").  Up next is \\"Candlebright\\", a classic acoustic strummer that would fit on any one of Nicks' solo albums. It's amazing to think a song written over 30 years ago could stand the test of time and sound this fresh, but I guess that's the sign of a true artist.  One of the highpoints of \\"TISL\\", \\"Sorcerer\\" is amazing on so many levels. While it's easy to dismiss the song as typical Nicks airy-fairyness, take the time to go a little deeper...With it's strumming acoustic guitars and rhythmic backbone, \\"Sorcerer\\" finds Nicks hitting high notes she hasn't hit in years, if ever. It's just another example of the fact that Stevie Nicks is \\"back!\\"  \\"Planets Of The Universe\\" is also classic Nicks. With elements of both \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Nightbird\\" in it, the song creeps along, building, then exploding. Mark my word.....this track will give \\"Stand Back\\" and \\"Edge Of Seventeen\\" a run for their money in concert!  I was a little wary about \\"Every Day\\" as \\"TROUBLE...\\"'s first single but, after a few listens, the track's simplicity has won me over. There's a swaying magic to it.....hearing Nicks sing \\"Imagine all the ways to cope/I close my eyes, that gives me hope\\" in an almost a cappella whisper is, quite honestly, both breath-taking and heart-breaking.  Another major success is \\"Too Far From Texas.\\" Cowritten by Sandy Stewart (when is she going to do another record?!?), this track will be an across-the-board smash on both the AC and pop charts, and may very well cross over to the country charts. Nicks and Dixie Chicker Natalie Maines blend perfectly together, and with a band that includes Mike Campbell, Sheryl Crow and Benmont Tench backing them, well, you can't get much better than this!  What is known as \\"Side Two\\" on the tape opens with the hip-swaying, slightly psychedelic \\"That Made Me Stronger\\", an autobiographical song inspired by Tom Petty. Probably the most representative of where Nicks is now in her life, it ends with the words \\"Everything has changed now/And I don't want to go back/And nothing you can say can change my mind.\\"  Then there's the Sheryl Crow-penned \\"It's Only Love.\\" With it's stripped-down instrumentation, simple arrangement and hushed vocal, this is one of the most nakedly honest and touching songs Nicks has ever recorded. It's simply lovely.  Next up is \\"Love Changes\\", with it's boarderline dance/rap sensibility, and \\"I Miss You\\", another sweetly acoustic track that just seems to float out of the speakers.  \\"Bombay Sapphires\\" is probably \\"TISL\\"'s weakest track, but it still has a nice third world/rock vibe to it (even if Macy Gray's backing vocals are all but nonexistant).  Wrapping up the CD are two more of it's strongest tracks. \\"Fall From Grace\\" is another autobiographical rocker that, reminiscent of Tom Petty's \\"I Need To Know\\", is sure to win Nicks her first (and long overdue!) Female Rock Vocal Grammy.  Closing out the CD isthe gorgeous \\"Love Is.\\" Buoyed by Sarah McLachlan's piano and haunting backing vocals, Nicks just shines here. Always known for closing her albums on a strong note - O.K., we won't mention \\"STREET ANGEL\\" and \\"Jane!\\" - Nicks keeps the tradition alive with this tender track.  In closing, a lot of people will want to compare \\"TISL\\" with Santana's \\"SUPERNATURAL.\\" Fine.....it is a similar formula; Nicks has created an album with some of today's hottest young talent, yet retained her own identity. And, yes, she may be similarly lucky come Grammy time.  But \\"TISL\\" is so much more. It's the work of an artist many people had written off as recently as five years ago. It's the work of an artist who managed to come back fresher and more vibrant than ever. It's the work of an artist who's sure to be in the running for my Album of the Year. In short, it's the work of an artist......and, quite simply, a masterpiece.s the gorgeous \\"Love Is.\\" Buoyed by Sarah McLachlan's piano and haunting backing vocals, Nicks just shines here.

B00004Z4WR|1.0|I thought this was such a boring film its hard to evaluate the DVD objectively so I won't even try. Even for a pure action film I thought it was boring. I didn't care about the characters. The action sequences seemed fairly canned. How many car chases can a person watch? Admittingly its hard to make a scene that everyone has probably seen a hundred times, but as much as they tried the chase scenes were fairly standard. You can watch the action highlight featurette and the time needed to watch the whole movie. Overall a very bad value. If this was at a garage sale I may pick it up for a couple of bucks but there wasn't a single thing in the movie that would make me add this to my collection.
B000056NX4|3.0|It's a pity to have waited almost 30 years for a new video version of JCS and have such a mess of Jesus. Glenn Carter's performance is a mess. What a lack of criteria to create the character. His intentions are so childish and uncontroled (he hits a table, cries when Judas insults him but remains unaffected when death is around the corner, and has that constant gesture of \\"Look at my eyebrows and mouth: I'm angry!\\"). He doesn't give, at all, the appearence of someone who's related to a Universal Order or Plan. Jesus must be misunderstood and misterious, not ingenue and explicit (Carter's Jesus is a poor and unstable man who knows less than his apostles what's going on and, because of that, falls prey of his lack of reflection). He doesn't look like someone mentally or spiritually able to direct anything. It's so easy to expose him in front of others and make him feel bad (where's his sureness on what he`s doing? The key to Superstar is to have a Jesus and a Judas so sure in what they believe, that the audience feels a true drama between them). Not to say Carter's Jesus exagerates when he's touched by women: is he in some kind of orgy to put that Emperor-like face? Is Mary Magdalene his girlfriend? He seems almost conducted by her. I felt really sorry when I got to \\"Gethsemane\\" and said to myself: \\"Oh, now I remember, this guy had something to do with God!\\" The way he sings and the way he acts seems to me much more a plea for not being killed for having kissed Mary, rather than a questioning to his Father for the necessity of dying to accomplish his trascending goal. No Jesus who sings with more feeling \\"Poor Jerusalem\\" than \\"Gethsemane\\" deserves to be considered. <br />On the other hand, Jerome Pradon's Judas is superb. Even though he has some trouble reaching the high notes, he really moves the audience (what a vibrato in \\"Heaven on their Minds\\"!!). His intentions are so well driven. His discomptempt grows gradually, as it should be, otherwise, if Judas despised Jesus since the beginning, one couldn't explain phrases like \\"And remember, I've been your right hand man all along\\". Two thumbs up!!<br />Palms for Tony Vincent's Simon, also.<br />I give 3 stars 'cause, after all, the concept is great. But serious miscasts (such as Pilate, which seems to me a sort of Street Fighter's M. Bison), unexploited voices (like Renee Castle's) and unreflexed/unexplainable interpretations (like Glenn Carter's), doesn't make this version excede the '73 movie.
6305718954|3.0|A film that I enjoyed because it matches my own personal views about God and the Roman Catholic church. A DVD that was a gift and probably wouldn't have added to my collection unless it was on the discount rack. Decent acting, soundtrack and suspense were all pluses in this film although it does rip-off the Exorcist but with a twist. The deleted scenes were rightfully deleted. With the exception of the alternative ending and an alternative beginning, none of the scenes add much or take anything away. Some are more explicit versions of scenes still in the film. The scenes are a longer more explicit sex scene between Frankie and Steve, a alternative beginning where Alameda kills himself by jumping off the church, a scene where Frankie is in the salon alone and stuff starts flying around poltergeist fashion, a scene where Frankie kicks Steve out of her apartment after a fight, a more explicit scene where Frankie stabs her wrist and finally a alternative ending where it is implied that Frankie dies. Overall, a film that I wouldn't add to my collection unless it was a gift. Definitely worth a look.
0671867369|4.0|Band of Brothers is another classic work by Steven Ambrose.  I firmly believe that Steven Ambrose is a living national tresure and should be revered for recording the history of World War Two in a manner that goes beyond dates and events.  Where Band of Brothers differs from other accounts of World War Two, is that it delivers a clear and concise account of what it means to be a foot soldier, from basic trainning to combat.  Another important difference is that Ambrose identifies the value of freedom in the defeat of Germany.  No other author express the importance of freedom for the success of an army better than Ambrose.  Ambrose rules supreme in his ability to cut through the Hollywood image of war, to instruct his reader as to the importance of character, leadership, devotion and duty to a solider.   By intermixing personal accounts and historical data, the reader gains a much deeper appreciation for the event and the men's emotions.  There are no heroes in war, only buddies serving eachother and surviving despite the worst conditions. Where other authors, less talented, fall back on shock literature, Ambrose somehow finds a way to communicate at a level that everyone will apreciate and remember. My respect for the men of E company, is beyond words.  I owe them all my best efforts for the rest of my life.  Without their sacrifices I am sure my reality would be significantly different.  I am indebted to Steven Ambrose for his work, and know you'll feel the same after reading this excellent book. &quot;When you are in the service of your fellow man, you are only in the service of your God.&quot; Hoo Yah Easy Company!!
0679879269|2.0|It's really a shame that Philip Pullman had to throw in all sorts of bizarre pseudo-religious mumbo jumbo into this book (The new Adam and Eve, the new serpant, assassin priests, etc.).  I mean REALLY!  The plots of the first two books in the series were extremely well written and engaging.  However, this book (what should have been the climax of the two prior ones leading up to it) instead took a wild swerve and became nothing more than a vehicle for Mr. Pullman to vent some wacked out religious views.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|How long have I been waiting for this? Too long. I am very excited to see the coolest Anime ever come out on Region 1 DVD. This movie is so creative and enrapturing, I personally prefer to listen to the Japanese tracks, but I am an uber-freak.<br />The science fiction aspect of this movie is awesome and creative and the animation is very cleaver and realistic. If you have not seen this movie, then you must!
1577311523|5.0|This book is a real gem, to say the least. Eckhart Tolle is able to explain very deep and fundamental issues about life, ourself (body, mind, pure consciousness), and the universe in simple words, making this universal wisdom surprisingly accessible. For instance, Mr. Tolle brilliantly explains the fascinating concepts of time and space and their relationship to our mind and its processes and pitfalls, in other words, their relationship to the way we experience our life.  This practical book contains important portals to disidentify from the mind/ego and to be in touch more deeply with our true inner self by entering the eternal now and, as a result, becoming more and more liberated from the past and the future.  The book is written in a captivating format using highly relevant questions and answers.  While reading or listening (the unabridged audio book is very inspirational too!) your consciousness will shift profoundly. It is a mind-blowing read/listening experience, even literally speaking ;-) In case you are looking for a meditation practice that perfectly fits in with these pure insights and pragmatic 'exercises/portals' bringing inner peace and joy on a day-to-day basis.
B0000026J6|5.0|Like many others, I first heard this man sing on the soundtrack of Pump Up the Volume. Picking up the soundtrack album, however, I found a verstion of the song Everybody Knows by Concrete Blonds, and was confused. <br />Then I found I'm Your Man.<br />This is an album that lives on your turntable, disc player, whatever, for like 6 solid months, then you put it away.  Then it calls you back.<br />Jazz Police does break the album up, true, but it brings out the best of the rest, and the rest IS the best.
6305841861|3.0|I won't repeat the plot as it has already been done to death in other reviews.  However, to put in my two cents, I believe that there are much better (i.e. funnier and grosser) examples of horror-comedy that deserve greater attention than the Evil Dead series such as Bride of Re-Animator.  That being said, this movie does deserve viewing.  Besides good special effects, one of its greatest assets is Bruce Campbell's wonderful performance as the flawed but likeable lead character that adds something most horror-comedy movies are missing: a hero worth rooting for.  This has the effect of also placing the movie in the adventure genre (which Raimi later became rich off of with Hercules and Xena).  It is far less silly than the Toxic Avenger (also fun) so you do get more into the story.  And, unlike Bride of Re-Animator, it won't ever leave you feeling nauseous (but, the tradeoff is that with far less tension, the humour is less of a welcome relief).  Watching this movie is like reading an enjoyable, tongue-in-cheek horror comic.  Don't take it too seriously, sit back and have fun.
B000002U82|5.0|This album propelled Pink Floyd from cult heroes into playing stadiums. Like \\"Sargeant Peeper's\\" 6 years prior, it's a sonic milestone that ushered in higher prduction standards. Every song flows naturally into the next. So why do I rarely listen to it? Because these dinosaur \\"Classic Rock\\" stations that permeate the airwaves have very small playlists. They play a few key songs by an artist and pretty much ignore a larger body of work that often  was quite popular or at least, influential. They wind up grinding songs into my head like a mantra. In the case of Pink Floyd, it's amounts to about 3 or 4 tracks from this album. 2 tracks from \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and  a few from \\"The Wall\\"...DSOM along with \\"Meddle\\" for me represent Pink Floyd at their best. They came very close with \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Animals\\" sounded more like a loud hard rock band with thrown in sound effects. \\"The Wall\\", which had an incredible (albeit depressing) story, had some great music on it, but was way too bloated with disposable filler. \\"The Final Cut\\" was just plain attrocious. On DSOM, the band was writing together with Waters handling all the lyrics. By the time \\"Animals\\" rolled around, he was in complete control of the band. Gone was most of the group spirit of experimentation that produced the likes of this and \\"Meddle\\"
0780624890|4.0|STORY: Half Vampire, half Human, Blade (Wesley Snipes) fights against evil Vampires led by Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who have plans to conquer the world. He is assisted by veteran Vampire hunter Whistler, portrayed by Kris Kristofferson.<br />CAST: Wesley Snipes plays the ultra cool hero and you definately root for him. Although it seems that sometimes he tries too hard at being a hero but most of the time he succeeds. What makes Stephen Dorff's character scary is his innteligence, which is expressed beautifully in the actor's eyes. He is probably one of the most convincing comic villans since Jack Nicholson in Batman.<br />SCRIPT: It is based on a comic series, so the story is rather thin. There are very original ideas about the modern Vampires but some far-fetched plot parts and untied story strings. But the hero get's his catchy one-liners and there is plenty of irony in it, which helps to not take it too serious.<br />DIRECTING: As I first saw it, the images blew me away. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed and shot and there's a really stylish atmosphere to it. The industrial soundtrack adds to the rythmic editing and accelerates the fights. The special effects are somewhat weak, but this is a glossy B-Movie and that is part of the fun it provides. As I saw the brilliant &quot;Matrix&quot; one year later I realized that some shots seemed very familiar to Blade.<br />THE DVD: The picture quality of the DVD is wonderful but the Dolby Digital sountrack lacks some dimension. But the disc is loaded with extra features including commentary and isolated score. The most interesting ones deal with the history of Vampires and they match perfect with the movie<br />ALL IN ALL. Brace yourself for a fun, loud ride with some special effect and story flaws. Just shut down your brain before you start and enjoy!
B000002B5L|5.0|I really love this album.  It's just one of those albums that everytime you listen to it, you end up loving it even more than before.  It's a very cohesive album, with themes appearing from earlier songs throughout the album, and this makes it fun to listen to.  You can listen through the whole thing in one sitting, as all of the songs are really great.  The lyrics actually mean something, it's just not like the recent stuff that's coming out with all that &quot;bling bling, I have a Bentley, and 5 mercedes, etc...&quot;.  The lyrics are very political, and very witty.  All the songs are good, but some songs that I'm particularly fond of are &quot;ready or not&quot;, &quot;fugeela&quot;, &quot;Killing me softly&quot;, &quot;cowboys&quot;, &quot;no woman no cry&quot;, and &quot;manifest&quot;. No matter what kind of music you like (I personally like rock), I recommend this album to you.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|Since I am a hughe fan of the Scream Trilogy, I had to see this movie. I knew that it wouldn't be geat because &quot;Scream&quot; was a parody already and what good can a parody of a parody be? So I rented Scary movie, which proved to be a big mistake... I am damaged for the rest of my life... Not really but it just wasn't funny at all. Ooh, look we do drug and crude sex jokes, we are so funny. Anyone who isn't an absolute prude human being will scratch their haid and go &quot;oh, so there's lots of sperm but what the hell is funny bout that?&quot; I have to admit that I laughed twice in this movie but for a gag after gag firework that is way too less. Me and my pal were almost silent during the whole movie, looking at each other wondering what had become of movie audiences. The movie is not worth too many words so just keep away and stick to the real deal.. Scream.
6305095574|4.0|Little known (to those who only watch mainstream cinema) horror/cult classic about 5 college friends who try to &quot;get away from it all&quot; by spending a weekend shacked up in a cabin in a forest in the middle of nowhere.  However, after discovering an old audio tape containing a recorded message that when played causes evil spirits to come forth from the Netherworld in search of those who disturbed their peaceful slumber, the friends find their little weekend getaway turning into their worst nightmares brought to life.  One by one the friends are killed by the vengeful demons only to become demons themselves, until only Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left standing to conquer the evil spirits.<br />&quot;The Evil Dead&quot; is truly one of the best, and wildest, horror/cult films ever made.  Originally, a box office failure when theatrically released in 1983, the film has since become a huge underground hit and eventually became popular enough to spawn two very worthy sequels, &quot;Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn&quot; (1987) &amp; &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; (1993).<br />The &quot;Evil Dead&quot; trilogy, along with Romero's &quot;Living Dead&quot; films, is perhaps the best example of a horror film's ability to evolve if given the chance to do so.  The first &quot;Evil Dead&quot; film is played off as strictly being a horror film filled with blood and guts and a very slight touch of humor.  &quot;Evil Dead 2&quot;, while technically a continuation of part one, is more like a remake of the first film with a much greater amount of camp humor and slapstick comedy thrown in around the elements of terror.  The third (and best in my opinion) film of the trilogy is &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;.  This one is quite different from the first two films in that it takes place during the dark ages (one will have to view the end of part two to understand how the change in time and place has occurred), and that the element of horror has now all but disappeared from the storyline, having been replaced almost entirely by the highly absurd (but also highly entertaining) camp humor and wild slapstick first brought to the series in the second film, with a hint of sword &amp; sorcery and swashbuckling elements thrown in for good measure.<br />The three films in the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; saga are by far the best career efforts by Director Raimi and Actor/Producer Campbell.  Yes, the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; films truly are minor masterpieces in their own right and should be seen atleast once by every film buff.  I personally recommend watching all three films back-to-back, along with Romero's &quot;Living Dead&quot; trilogy.  Now there's a real &quot;fright film fest&quot;!
B000056H5J|4.0|A DAY WITHOUT RAIN is a briliant CD. The stand out tracks are as always the title track &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;, &quot;Wild Child&quot;, &quot;Only Time&quot;, &quot;Flora's Secret&quot; and &quot;The First Of Autumn&quot;. However, like the other reviewer, I have to complain that this CD is far too short. I mean, paying $ for just over 35 minutes worth of music is a little too extreme. Surely Enya has plenty other songs that she could put on her CD. Never the less, Enya has always been a terrific and persistent artist and I hope she will always continue to do what she does best.
B00000JG41|5.0|Experimental music, as Os Mutantes proved in the 60s, can be the most fun music too with loads of melody. And Mr Bungle's knowledge of everything from Eastern mantras to Film Noir soundtracks stretches 44 minutes of music about as far as it'll go. If Jack Nicholson starred in China Town but in his persona as Johnny from the Shining and Brian Wilson produced the soundtrack with his loopy 1967 head on, you might get some idea what California sounds like.  Or you might be even more confused. Buy the album anyway, this sort of thing should be encouraged.
6305907145|5.0|geez louise! it says right there in the beginning of the movie &quot;inspired by jane austen's novel, letters, and other writings.&quot; ms.austen should be flattered that ms. rozema, the writer/director has been able to film what i believe to be the most nuanced and &quot;unfilmable&quot; of all of austen's novels. yes, i'm an austen fan, and no- i didn't find anything wrong with this film. bottom line- do you like good acting &amp; tons of romance? then this is the movie for you! the DVD comes with lots of fun extra as well, including ms. rozema's highly enlightening commentary. great movie!
B0000067X1|5.0|Tago Mago is not only Can's masterpiece, it's one of the greatest albums of the so-called &quot;kosmiche musick&quot; or Krautrock era.  I don't need to repeat what others have said before, other than to say that this is an awesome collection of funky grooves and spine chilling sonic landscapes.  Can called this their &quot;magic record,&quot; and it is infused with mysticism...not, mind you, the serene and safe mysticism of new age music.  This mysticism is dark, edgy, and deliciously dangerous, from the title of the album, Tago Mago, which is some kind of mystic site in Crowleyian mythology, to Damo Suzuki's vocals, which range from calm, almost mumbling, to ecstatic frenzy, to angst filled shrieks, to rhythmic chanting.  Jaki (drums) and Holger (bass) provide a mesmerizing groove through the first half of the album, with Michael (guitar) and Irmin (keyboards) adding flesh and substance.  The band veers into frightening, experimental territory on the second half, but it's no less spellbinding than the first half.  Organic, rich, diverse, and wholly original and challenging, even by today's standards, this is music for not just the body, but also the mind.  Get into it.  Let it move you.  Let it change you.  Enjoy!
068484267X|4.0|\\"Angela's Ashes\\" was about Irishman Frank McCourt's childhood- living with his often-distraught mother, alcoholic father, and siblings.  They were very poor, and went through numerous difficulties dealing with deaths, lack of food, lack of money, and housing conditions.  Basically, the McCourt family had difficulties with everything.  Their ultimate goal was to earn enough money to go to America, where they were convinced their troubles would be over.<br />The reason I rated this book 4 stars and not 5 was mainly for boredom's sake.  While it was humorous, and, for the most part, quite interesting- it remained practically the same throughout the entire book.  What I mean is that it had no variation!  \\"Angela's Ashes\\" was very depressing- mainly consisting of poverty, depression, and sadness.  I understand that that's because Frank McCourt's childhood was made up of poverty, depression, and sadness, but personally- at times I found it rather uneventful.<br />Overall, \\"Angela's Ashes\\" was very good, despite the occasional boredom.  To learn about Frank McCourt's life in all its poverty makes me realize how lucky I am today to have everything that I need, and more.  It was extremely moving, and I am glad to have read it.  I assure everyone who reads it will also be!
B00000JCOV|2.0|Many anti-Slipknot reviews have simply slated them left right and centre saying they're noise. And then the pro-Slipknot reviews claim the band sh%t diamonds and that they're the heaviest thing ever. I'll probably still get unhelpful votes anyway but here are my honest likes and dislikes, and I'm trying to be constructive:-<br />1. It really isn't that heavy. You only need to listen to the whole death metal (Cannibal Corpse) and black metal (Satyricon) scene to find that out. 2. It isn't that emotional. &quot;How Will I Laugh Tomorrow...&quot; (album) by Suicidal Tendencies and &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; (song) by Ozzy Osbourne prove that singing instead of shouting can sometimes feel MORE emotional for the listener, rather than just resorting to screaming. While we're on the subject, the lyrics are awful and constantly swear. I can't say I'm offended by swearing but it makes me roll my eyes and it's very juvenile (I think that and I'm 16 - these guys are in their 20s and early 30s for crying out loud). 3. They're not that talented. The guitar and bass parts are very simple and contain no more than 4 chords, usually 2 or 3. Plus I'm a big fan of guitar solos, of which there are none. 4. As far as personal taste goes, I don't like the scratches or samples or when Corey Taylor raps here and there. 5. The image (and how they claim they are an anti-image) is just farcical - even funnier than Cradle Of Filth (who are much better by the way - although they're totally different).<br />But on the up side:- 1. They are quite tight and they do what they do reasonably well, I guess. 2. The vocals, despite being a bit nu-metal for me, are better than many death-metal vocals and if Taylor left the band, took off that ridulous mask, re-formed with another band and did something a little more complex and interesting then I would check it out (yeah, like that's gonna happen). 3. Yes, they may have 3 drummers which does help, but the drumming is really cool at times.<br />Altogether, not my thing, I've told you why, but there elements of it that I quite like. 2 stars is all I can see fit to give it (that's all I gave Satyricon's Rebel Extravaganza, and I LIKE that band, just not that album). That's me done.ot my thing, I've told you why, but there elements of it that I quite like. 2 stars is all I can see fit to give it (that's all I gave Satyricon's Rebel Extravaganza, and I LIKE that band, just not that album).

B00004TRD8|5.0|This is definitely one of the best DVD ever produced but I noticed that during the truck-helicopter chase, when the helicopter went under the bridge, a distorted sound (hiss) is heard on the right surround(rear) speaker. Does anyone experienced the same flaw?
B00000BKDS|4.0|Considering that when you mention Iron Maiden these days people associate them with Brave New World, it makes me wondor how many of them have heard this album. I can honestly say that I feel that this album is one of their best. My all-time favourite would have to be &quot;Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son&quot;, but one step and the following albums are all at pretty much the same level of quality:- &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot;, &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot;, &quot;Powerslave&quot;, &quot;Killers&quot; and this one. To say that &quot;Piece Of Mind&quot; is up there with these albums is a joke.<br />Anyway, this is the better of the two Di'Anno albums (although only slightly), the other being &quot;Killers&quot;. This contains some real classic songs such as &quot;Prowler&quot;, &quot;Phantom Of The Opera&quot; and &quot;Running Free&quot; but in all seriousness there are no fillers. Every song is really good. These versions are far superior to the live versions on &quot;A Real Live Dead One&quot;.<br />Although this isn't their absolute finest hour I still feel that this is a much better album than &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot;, &quot;Piece Of Mind&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;. The other studio albums aren't even worth mentioning. This is a damn great album, and one that is different to most other Maiden albums (aside from &quot;Killers&quot; which also has Paul Di'Anno on vocals). One of the first albums to start off The New Wave Of British Heavy Metal back in the late 70s and early 80s!!

158234082X|3.0|This is a hyper-fast, enjoyable read.  Though badly edited, it's written in a very compelling and jocular style.  Plusses are the dining and pro cooking tips, while the big minus is Bourdain's windy expanded resume.  For about 100 pages, he talks about all the places he worked in and why they failed -- not very interesting and rather annoying.  Otherwise a fun, fluffy read.  Enjoy.
B00005AUBA|3.0|This release has some nice instrumentals. A bit more subdued than previous releases, but still pretty good. They're a bit more melancholy.<br />This &quot;full length&quot; CD is under 40 minutes. That took away a star. The only thing &quot;full length&quot; about it is the price. I didn't like that.
B00002DEQQ|5.0|Great music best Tom has ever done I love it
B00000IMTH|4.0|As a previous reviewer said, LONG LIVE ROCK 'N' ROLL has some great songs but not very good production values.  Considering that it was produced by Martin Birch, one of the greatest rock &amp; roll producers ever, who did both RITCHIE BLACKMORE'S RAINBOW and RISING (the latter of which has especially crisp and clear production values), I tend to think that the relatively shoddy production on this album was intentional.  Maybe Birch and the band were going more for a raw sound on this one (after all, it IS the only Rainbow album with the words &quot;rock 'n' roll&quot; in the title).  Whatever the case may have been, it IS a very good CD with some great moments.  It is also the HEAVIEST Rainbow record of them all!!<br />LONG LIVE ROCK 'N' ROLL is actually a very interesting CD in that it represents a crossroads between the past and the future for both Ritchie Blackmore and Ronnie James Dio.  Think about it: Ritchie Blackmore's guitar themes clearly conjure up his earlier work with Deep Purple, while occasionally sounding like some of the work he would do later on with--surprise!--Deep Purple.  The best example of this is &quot;Kill The King&quot; on which Ritchie's fast &amp; complex guitar work sounds very much like what he did on the great Deep Purple song &quot;Burn&quot; a few years earlier...while ALSO sounding similar to &quot;A Gypsy's Kiss&quot; which he would do with DP on the &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; album in 1984.  It's right in the middle of Ritchie's career, both literally and figuratively. :)<br />As for Ronnie James Dio, who came into the newly-formed Rainbow in 1975 as the lead singer of a relatively simple barroom-type bloozy rock &amp; roll band called Elf, left soon after making this, his final album with Rainbow...and he left as the foremost presence in progressive heavy metal.  By the time this CD was recorded, Dio had hit his full progressive metal stride, and was singing like he was ready to front Black Sabbath (which he would do just 2 years later).  Again, this is borne out by &quot;Kill The King,&quot; as Dio screams on it like he did in &quot;Die Young&quot; just 2 years later on the great Black Sabbath album HEAVEN AND HELL.<br />The total classic rock &amp; roll anthem &quot;Long Live Rock 'N' Roll&quot; kicks the album off with a Cozy Powell drumroll, finds it's groove the second Ronnie James Dio screams &quot;ALRIGHT!!!&quot; and boogies the rest of the way, courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore's inspired guitar work and Bob Daisley's in-step bass.  Very few records start off better than this.<br />Next is &quot;Lady Of The Lake&quot; which, I swear, sounds very much like &quot;Lady Evil&quot; (another one sung by Dio just 2 years later on Black Sabbath's HEAVEN AND HELL), with its mid-tempo metal groove.  &quot;Gates Of Babylon&quot; is a long, ambitious song which features complex keyboard signatures by David Stone, and strings courtesy of the Bavarian String Ensemble.  As technically proficient as this epic-scale tune is, it just doesn't capture anything, or do anything, for me. I don't know why, I just can't get into it.  &quot;Kill The King&quot; is full-speed-ahead metal mastery, with fast, blazing rhythm guitar work by Blackmore (not usually known for his rhythm guitar work) and drum assault by Powell-- and is the fastest and heaviest song that Rainbow has ever done in their entire history.  It is about as fast and heavy as the fastest and heaviest songs on Black Sabbath's HEAVEN AND HELL.  &quot;The Shed (Subtle)&quot; is an interesting tune that marks what I believe to be Ritchie Blackmore's first experimentation with guitar synthesizers.  &quot;Sensitive To Light&quot; is the CD's one short song, and it goes pretty much nowhere, although it is well-sung by Dio.  But the most incredible thing about this CD is what happens next.<br />Up till this point, LONG LIVE ROCK 'N' ROLL has been a raw, brutal attack on the aural senses.  It ends with &quot;Rainbow Eyes,&quot; which is a song that is so soft, dreamy, and beautiful that is defies comparison with the rest of the album.  At 7:21, it is the longest track on the CD, but you don't want it to end.  Ronnie James Dio sings so beautifully that this song must be played for anybody who's paranoid of heavy metal, and for all those who think that all Dio can do is scream.  Ritchie Blackmore plucks away at his guitar so softly that you don't realize at first that it's not even an acoustic guitar he's playing.  It is electric, and the resulting reverberating notes are haunting in their sound.  Just as this CD begins with one of the greatest rock anthems ever, it ends with one of the most beautiful ballads ever.  Very few records end better than this. :)<br />For anybody who's interested in, but not familiar with, Rainbow, check out their later stuff with Joe Lynn Turner first (specifically, BENT OUT OF SHAPE and STRAIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES), then flash all the way back to 1975 with their first album (that'll give you some culture shock!). Then, buy Rising, and then buy this CD.  For those of you who are already Rainbow fans, you should definitely pick this up regardless of the order...although you might want to wait until PolyGram releases a remastered version, first. ;)
B000000WA4|5.0|Released at a time when a high school student like myself could relate, no album has had quite the impact that Smashing Pumpkin's &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinte Sadness&quot; has on alternative music.  Anyone that said alternative was not art was quieted in 1995.  Billy Corgan and the band went to work and created a musical masterpiece which has only been grazed and never duplicated by the band since.<br />Depressing as the album may be, it has worked for the likes of Depeche Mode and REM in the past.  Besides, art is not always flowers and rainbows.  Truth always has had her place in the world of creation and art, and the Pumpkins simply wanted to paint something that all could relate to.  Depressing, compelling, soothing, harsh, and Inspiring; the album contains all of musics four seasons in one 120 minute double disc.  Symphonic rock has one of her most beautiful prospects in the single &quot;Tonight, Tonight.&quot;  Teenage angst was given a theme song with the release of &quot;Zero,&quot; a chilling tail of depression, realism, and rebellion.  &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings,&quot; is Corgan's take on the world's &quot;wolf in sheep's clothing&quot; facade.  Indeed, the world sometimes is a vampire.<br />Again, the diversity here is simply amazing.  Point in case; on the second disc the opener is the hard-rocking antheme &quot;Where Boys Fear to Tread.&quot;  2 songs later it's the quiet, soothing &quot;Thirty-three,&quot; about Corgan's life.  2 songs after that, &quot;1979&quot; the album's song for the pop world.  And again, 2 songs after that, one of the most beautiful, compelling, awe-inspiring ballads to date, &quot;Thru the Eyes of Ruby.&quot;  All four songs are classics in their respective fields, but the styles are so different, it's amazing that the band recorded them at the same time.<br />I've heard it said, &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is what punk rock would sound like if it were directed by Steven Speildberg.&quot;  For toget an actual experience in music of this magnitude, time, and intensity, it really would NEED someone to direct it all.  Instead, it's done with four buddies from Illinois.  A classic in every right.  One of the best albums of all-time and highly recommended...

B00000269M|5.0|I swear, if Michael had released every song on this album, each and everyone of them would be a hit. But all the ones he did release will forever remain classics. 'I Just can't Stop loving you' should be on a list for the greatest love songs of all time. It's just great. After listening to 'just good friends', another part of me', 'bad', 'smooth criminal',etc., you'll know why they call him the king of pop. His music is just a testimony to his genius and talent. His lyrics speak to you like no one can. It's one of those rare albums where you don't need to skip a track. It's really worth your money. Overall, this album should be a mandatory requirement in CD players everywhere. It's an album that doesn't age with time and sounds better each time you listen to it.
B000002LFZ|5.0|The four essential albums are: Rumours, Fleetwood Mac, The Dance, and Greatest Hits.<br />Yeah, I owned copies of Mirage and Tusk on vinyl. They didn't get played much. There are gems scattered throughout various Mac albums, but they're often accompanied by songs that don't make buying the entire album worthwhile (except in the first three albums I mentioned above). <br />That's where this Greatest Hits collection saves the day. There are certain Fleetwood Mac songs I would find it hard to live without -- &quot;Tusk&quot;, &quot;Sara&quot;, &quot;Gypsy&quot;, and a little tune that I'm often surprised to find that I dig so much: &quot;Everywhere&quot;.<br />So, don't go off buying what you won't listen to -- this collection is part of the &quot;Essential Four&quot;. But we'll see what the future holds ... if The Dance showed anything, it's that they've still got what it takes, and then some.
0201633612|5.0|a must for any serious developer.  <br />I picked up this book because of a recommendation from an instructor.  Not only did I find the knowledge in this book essential to good, sound software development, but in a matter of hours I was using a pattern in one of my pet projects.  <br />After reading this book you can immediately go back to your past projects and make drastic improvements.
B00005J9G7|5.0|These guys are sensational.  They perform a hard edged blend of hard rock that is as relevant today as when the album was recorded.  I was happy to find this album on Amazon, I last heard it in '94 when I left uni and forgot about it until seeeing it here on Amazon recently.<br />The best songs on the album undoubtedly are Girl Nation and Sleeping My Day Away.  Both have catchy guitar riffs that you can play over and over without getting sick of.  Sleeping My Day Away should be the anthem of the youth.  If the record company promoted it, this album could  anumber one seller today in the US!<br />The best thing about this album is you don't feel like skipping one song.  They are all well crafted, Ill Will, Rim of Hell, Overmuch and Jihad all go hard.<br />If you like hard rock you are not complete until you own this album.
B00005ATQM|4.0|I just purchased the new DVD and after tweaking my Dolby Digital Receiver, it sound awesome.  I'm not sure if it was worth the $20.00 plus dollars.  I think that they should have included a few music videos to go with some of the audio tracks as bonus material, or maybe some updated interviews with bands members.  This is why I rated it a 4 out of 5 stars.  Metallica is known for going the extra mile, and they should have done so for the fans on this DVD.  There is a very short(3 minutes) clip of the upcoming 'Classic Albums' which is to debut sometime this summer on VH1.  In conclusion though, the music sounds superb.  They did a great job with mixing the sound channels.

B00000ICN5|5.0|If you only buy one Stevie Ray Vaughan album, make it Texas Flood. I never tire of hearing Stevie rip into these songs, and usually I find myself cranking up the volume as far as possible. <br />If all he had ever recorded were this album and The Sky Is Crying, his reputation as one of the all-time greats in modern blues would most certainly still be assured. It's astounding, really, the talent the man had. Clapton, BB, Stevie Ray -- very few artists could stand the comparison. SRV occasionally challenges the status of EC &amp; BB as kings of the blues, and on this album, you'll hear why.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The Coen brothers have worked their magic again with their excellent film &quot;O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?&quot;  The unique vision and perspective of the film is rivaled only by the excellence of its soundtrack, which might just be the best movie soundtrack I've heard.<br />Quite simply, there is not one weak track on this CD, period.  Not one.  There are highlights, to be sure, but the greatest aspect of this soundtrack might be that the diverse array of recordings and styles presents the listener with something new to appreciate every time they play the CD.<br />Some tracks deserve special mention, however.  Ralph Stanley's &quot;O Death&quot; is a haunting, passionate song , especially if one recalls the scene in which it appears during the movie.  &quot;Down In The River To Pray&quot; by Alison Krauss is another excellent track; when my friend heard the the harmonies of this song, so wonderfully ethereal and poignant, she simply said: &quot;that's beautiful.&quot;  And the Peasall Sisters are outstanding on &quot;In The Highways,&quot; singing with the innocence of children but harmonizing like adults as well.<br />In my opinion, however, the true gems of this soundtrack are the recordings by the Soggy Bottom Boys, featuring Tim Blake Nelson and Dan Tyminski.  &quot;In The Jailhouse Now&quot; is just fun to listen to, and knowing that Tim Blake Nelson and John Tuturro actually sang their parts for the movie rather than lip-synching adds an authenticity that is hard to get from Hollywood these days.<br />&quot;I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; is, however, the spiritual center of the movie and the most outstanding part of the soundtrack.  In the movie, George Clooney did such an excellent job lip-synching that moviegoers swore he was really singing the tune.  It was actually the work of Dan Tyminski, though Tim Blake Nelson and John Tuturro again sang their own parts.  This song simply sticks in your head and stays there, and for once that's a good thing.  Tyminski's vocals are outstanding, and the two recordings are distinctive enough that one appreciates both versions being included on the soundtrack.<br />Another noteworthy aspect of this CD is the liner notes by the Coen brothers, who unabashedly lament the disappearance of this style of music from Nashville in favor of 'modern country music.'  It is an interesting perspective from two filmmakers who always seem to have something important to say through their art.Tyminski's vocals are outstanding, and the two recordings are distinctive enough that one appreciates both versions being included on the soundtrack.<br />Another noteworthy aspect of this CD is the liner notes by the Coen brothers, who unabashedly lament the disappearance of this style of music from Nashville in favor of 'modern country music.'

B000002JS6|5.0|I first listened to the cassette version of this album when I was 14 years young. I am now 31 years young. Many things have changed during this period. I loved rock/heavy metal music then, but I prefer rap music now. I recently chanced upon the aforesaid cassette when I was tidying up my store room. I wiped the dust off the cassette cover and it returned to its original black. It brought back a lot of my memories .... both sad and happy ones. I looked at the condition of the cassette and I was certain that it had deteriorated beyond repair. I looked at the titles of the songs and started humming the tunes. I still remember the rythm after 17 years! The material put out by rock/heavy metal artist nowadays has not come close to within a light year of this album. So, to the younger rockers out there ..... &quot;you ain't heard nuthin' 'til you heard dis&quot;.<br />I will buy the remastered CD version of this album first thing tomorrow. I am sure my beloved son will nod to this too!
B00000JT9E|5.0|Fads come and go but slayer are here to stay and this video is documented proof.Several years after its release not only does the performance hold up,the songs still sound as fresh and as vital as ever.The fans obviously agree and some of the footage suggests that they are still ready to give their life for one of the worlds sickest bands.

B000002KGT|5.0|There's a reason why this sold so many millions of copies -- it's one of the essential albums for any rock/pop music fan to have in their collection. Nearly every song still holds up after nearly a quarter of a century. <br />Along with their previous eponymous release, Rumours marks the zenith of one of the most talented groups of the rock era (followed closely by their &quot;comeback&quot; album, The Dance).
0767802659|5.0|I don't know which is worse, the guys who think this movie is stupid or the guys who go on and on about the Nazis, Goebbels, Mao's &quot;Big Lie&quot;, etc. etc.  The movie isn't about propaganda sillies.  And, the bugs aren't the &quot;good guys&quot;.  You people really need to think for yourself for once.  The movie is about killing.  Kill or be killed.  As a badass action movie there is nothing better.  Get some popcorn and a candy bar and watch it with all your friends.

B000003BZ4|4.0|Although not as steeped in the blues as the older Allman Brothers recordings, if you're a fan of the Allmans, you should get a kick from this Mule. No pretenders to the Southern Rock legacy, these guys have paid their dues, musically speaking, anyway -- and can rip out licks and belt out the rockin' blues with effortless energy. Check it out.
630463949X|5.0|My sons, who are both elementary school age, love this concert.  The hooks are Tusk -- with its stunning inclusion of the USC marching band -- and the close-ups of Mick Fleetwood, who has inspired my boys to assemble home-made drum kits out of anything they can find.  Every time we watch this, they pepper me with questions about how songs are written, what bass guitarists do, who decides which instrument plays when, why singers have different parts in a song, and so on. Who would have thought that this DVD would have made this impression?  It's a tribute to the production values that the children always know exactly what's going on and who's doing what. And the sound quality is terrific!
B000002GJH|5.0|This CD never had to grow on me, I fell in love the first time I listened to it. In a way, this CD changed my life... (a bit corny, but true)<br />I first found out about this CD (as is the case with most people) by accident. I was searching for reviews about \\"Soundgarden\\" (just discovered them at that stage as well) and stumbled upon this review. Of course, I read the reviews, saw \\"Soundgarden\\" & \\"Pearl Jam\\" (fallen in love with them too) collaboration and rushed out and bought the CD. Needless to say, the rest is history.<br />Sorry for the long intro, but I had to say it. To the lucky ones that find this CD, don't hesitate ot rush out and get this. It IS a classic and always will be. There are no losers on this CD, and something for everyone. <br />All my friends that I have lent this CD too tell me first that: \\"They had never heard of TOTD\\", & \\"IT'S BRILLIANT!!\\". Need anymore reason to get this? <br />This is the beginning of Pearl Jam, and Chris Cornell at his best. Even if you don't like this genre (if this CD does truly fall into one) of music, PLEASE don't hesitate. You will truly miss out.<br />Enjoy.
0783229526|1.0|I bought this after reading the reviews here. To make a long story short, it's the only DVD I 'm considering throwing on the trash can. I have more than 90, from all genres, and never felt this idiot before. The film is ridiculous, the acting is grotesque, I can't believe it gives pleasure to anyone. It's worst than many summer comedies, because it tries to be &quot;cult&quot;. Everything is so overacted and predictable that I didn't even smile once while watching it. As for the DVD only, it's normal, no valuable extras (if only this was possible with such a movie). The Amazon ranking was one of my guides for movies. After this bad trip I'll consider more before buying.
B000002KD5|5.0|This eponymous album strikes me as being a &quot;softer&quot; album than Rumours, at least in the overall feel, and the themes explored in the songs. Of course, this makes perfect sense, since much of Rumours was written about the breakup of relationships and other hard feelings between members of the group. <br />In this outing, however, Christine McVie's sultry and inviting voice seems to have a more calming influence on the album as a whole, especially in songs like &quot;Warm Ways,&quot; &quot;Over My Head&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me.&quot; And then of course, there's &quot;Landslide&quot; -- Stevie Nicks steps back from weaving her gypsy spells for a moment, and just speaks simply in this amazingly evocative song, which still gives me goosepimples whenever I hear it.<br />Although not nearly as big a seller as its follow-up, it's at least as worthy of being in your collection as Rumours, which is probably sitting on your shelf and wanting some company. Don't deny yourself the pleasures of this album.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I have been an ardent Stevie Nicks fan ever since I heard &quot;Rhiannon&quot; back in 1975 at the age of 13 on the first radio I ever owned.  Yet I didn't know the incredible face and bewitching persona that went with that remarkable voice until I saw Nicks gracing the back cover of &quot;Rumours&quot; several years later.  That being said, I have been a fan of her work largely within the confines of Fleetwood Mac, when, as another reviewer put it so well, Lindsey Buckingham was able to translate her &quot;internal landscapes&quot; into something coherent.  One only need listen to the differences between her demos and the final Fleetwood Mac product to know that Buckingham could take Nicks' great raw material and hone it into a polished gem.  Her solo work, however, has been largely disappointing, almost embarrassing.  It is sacrilege to many to say it, but even &quot;Bella Donna&quot; was weak--stripped down and simplistic compared to the lush arrangements on her Fleetwood Mac recordings.  There are a few exceptions in her solo work, most notably, &quot;Sleeping Angel,&quot; arguably one of her best songs ever.<br />But at long last, the solo Nicks I wanted to give up on (but could never quite bring myself to) has come through with a, for the most part, great CD.  One has to wonder how much Crow's influence brought this CD to a level of greatness, as it is on her acoustically-charged production numbers that Nicks is at her best--Candlebright, Sorcerer, It's Only Love.  The latter Crow song is exquisite and Nicks' interpretation brings it an aching gentleness and a tone of humility and resignation that one wishes we would witness more often in her own work.  Too often she lapses into self-righteousness (High priestess...she's the keeper of the peace in this), self-indulgence (witness most of &quot;That Made Me Stronger&quot;) and self-parody (&quot;I touch with gossamer wings&quot;--in a charging rock song??).  So why five stars?  No musician has ever achieved theperfect album (with one exception--almost anything by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds).  But lyrically, most of this album is lucid in a way that Nicks hasn't achieved in years (this is your brain on drugs), the melodies are soaring (not incidentally on most of her earlier songs), and the arrangements lush to the point that you can't help listening over and over again.  At last, it's legitimate to worship Ms. Nicks again.
B00002E233|2.0|Deep Blue Sea is an example of cinematic overkill.  Trying to pack three killer sharks with a lot of non-stop action in a confined setting isn't the way to make this sort of film.  Steven Spielberg did it almost flawlessly in Jaws, a brilliant film that featured incredible acting, exciting action, and fine special effects.  Deep Blue Sea has serviceable acting at best, yawn-inducing action, and CGI effects that are so fake I thought I was watching a video game.  To see how to get this sort of film done right, check out Jaws and its first sequel.  Oh, and Thomas Jane, you're no Roy Scheider.

0451527712|5.0|Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley, is a vortex of action. It follows the ambitious Victor Frankenstein who has set out to do the impossible: resurrect the dead. Victor is so swept up in his ambitions that he fails to acknowledge any of the consequences of following his dream -- that is until it is to late. Despite its great plot, Frankenstein is great for another reason as well: its timelessness. Many of the ethical questions regarding the limits of technology that Shelley pursues in Frankenstein are relevant today with the advent of cloning and genetic engineering.
B000056K04|3.0|This album has some interesting songs on it.  I must admit, I was into &quot;I Did It&quot; when I first heard it on the radio and I really like &quot;The Space Between&quot; and &quot;So Right&quot;, but after that, none of these songs are really that good.  DMB fans who enjoyed the &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; albums would be better to download &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot; from (...).  These are the new songs DMB treated us to on their summer 2000 tour.  They include &quot;Grey Street&quot;, &quot;Sweet Up and Down&quot;, and &quot;Bartender&quot;.  DMB fans check it out!!!!
B00005A0RI|5.0|The CD is truly exquisite.  As usual, Charlie Haden explores a  musical form and introduces his audience to a magical listening experience.  &quot;Nocturne&quot; offers the listener a series of beautiful melodies that linger in the mind.   I initially heard the selections on the Paris Jazz internet audio channel and was so impressed I headed straight to Amazon.com to find the CD.  If you are a fan of fine music you will greatly enjoy this offering.  It is highly recommended.
B00004W3MS|5.0|Words can't describe how good this album is.  It's unlike anything you've heard and as a result forces you to listen in an entirely different way.  It has an operatic quality about it that just paints pictures in your head.  Words defy it.  You really have to hear it to understand.
B00000K19E|1.0|This is the third time I have reviewed this movie, but I just have to submit a dissenting opinion to counter all these action film meatheads who can't separate sci-fi from hi-fi.  Look.  There is more to film than eye candy, visual effects and surround sound.  How about content?  If you really consider the Matrix in comparison to truly great sci-fi, like 2001, Blade Runner, Brazil, even Gattaca, it falls very short.  The matrix makes attempts at being literate, but the plot is so contirived and narcissistic that it defeats its purpose in that regard.  The Matrix is the antithesis of a good sci-fi film for these reasons: 1) it does not challenge social issues sufficiently as sci-fi does/should (unless you count the trite issues of reality or conformity), 2) it does not balance out form (FX) with content (storyline), 3) the metaphor and allegory are extremely overdone so as to appeal to a lazy audience (I find this underestimation very irritating, as should you as an intelligent viewer), etc., etc.  I could go on, but I won't.  I do however, disagree with the reviewer who blames this movie for the social ills and school shoootings in the good ol' U-S of A.  This movie is not a cause of any social disease.  It is just yet another symptom of America's defiant barbarism, but if we want to find the source of WHY murder happens we have to look into ourselves for that answer.  Don't be another lazy American.  Blaming the media is just full of fallacies.  There is good cinema and bad cinema.  This one happens to be the latter.
6303430570|5.0|One summer in college, I worked in a convenience store/gas station very much like the one that Dante worked in, so this movie brought back a flood of memories the first time I saw it.  I just this last week reviewed it for the first time since it came out, and I am delighted to be able to report that it was even funnier than I remembered it.<br />Now, this movie isn't for everyone.  I learned a long time ago that an awful lot of people don't like black and white films.  And a lot of folks don't like low budget films.  If either applies to you, just hold out for the next Hollywood blockbuster.<br />For the rest of us, who love and appreciate Independent film, this is just a great flick.  There are a lot of really hysterical characters, funny incidents, and, most of all, awesome dialog.  In fact, the only thing that really happens in this film is people talk a lot.  Luckily, it is GREAT talk.<br />If you haven't seen this yet, do yourself a favor and do so.  If you have, but not recently, do yourself a favor and see it again.  I think you will be surprised how much you enjoy it.
B00004SA8A|5.0|As much as one would prefer complete cycle recordings, very few pianists find so much afinity with a single composer as to offer a compelling account of a complete cycle.  Gilels or Richter never played Beethoven complete sonata cycles, Ashkenazy's Chopin cycle is full of great performances as the ballades and others were he seems to fall out of the love with the music as in the polonaises.  So the point being that rarely can a pianist do justice to complete sets, why is it that i am giving a 5 star rating to this set?  Well, to me it seems that Kempff had all the ideal atributes for Schubert playing as are solid technique and expansive rhythms, concentration in touch and a singing line, but most important is that you feel all throughout these recordings that he loves every detail of the music.  Simply put, it seems that he was enjoying himself here and all details considered, his Schubert playing is perfectly balanced.  Get it - soundwise Uchida's and Schiff's cycles have now the advantages of modern recordings, but both of them lack the heart Kempff has bestowed here.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I have been following this project through the media for months, and was very intrigued to get this soundtrack due to really liking Luhrmannn's &quot;Something for Everybody&quot; CD.  If the movie is half as well-done as the album...I read another reviewer who called this collection &quot;schizophrenic&quot;, but I think that Luhrmann manages to tie together an eclectic group of songs very effectively.  Nicole and Ewan's voices are more than up to the task, especially on &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot;.  The Fatboy Slim number fits well, as do the Beck and Bono numbers.  Great music that stands up to repeat plays.

078061755X|5.0|Contrary to popular belief, this movie is extremely accurate in the portrayal of David Helfgott.  It is a moving and delightful movie with a touch of the harshness of growing up as a young, Jewish prodigy, in a broken home.  The movie is well done and the soundtrack is also worth every penny! Also, concerning David's own album where he plays Rachmaninoff is wonderful too.  I'd like to see ANYONE attempt to play &quot;Rach 3!&quot; It is one of the most difficult piano pieces to play!  You may need to watch this movie two or three times to catch all that is happening.
B000059Z8J|5.0|The name Superman brings back so many memories doesn't it? Well watching this special edition brought back all of those feelings and more. This is a FANTASTIC dvd! All dvd's should aspire to be this good! The other reviews seem to mostly touch on the sound and picture quality (which are great), but I thought I would do a review mostly on the EXTRAS on this disc which are just incredible.<br />First of all, there are 3, approximately half hour, documentaries on the making of Superman. These are the real gems of this disc. They're great! One involves pre-production, one involves production and one involves the special effects. They are all roughly a half hour each and they are all well worth your time. You see the original screen tests for both Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder plus screen tests of ... Anne Archer, Leslie Ann Warren, Stockard Channing and other famous actresses all tested for Lois and you see them all. I didn't notice anyone famous trying out for SUPES because they decided early on that they wanted an unknown but there are screen tests of plenty of unknowns including the dentist of one of the producers wives! Too funny. There are some great scenes here. The great thing about all these documentaries is that you get to hear from everyone involved in NEW interviews, even Christopher Reeve. Many documentaries or featurettes on other dvd's try and cut together old interviews and try and fool you into thinking you are getting something new. Not here! This is all new stuff! The second documentary even touches on the shady dealings of the producers of this film and all the wrangling done to get this film to the big screen. It's all quite fascinating. The third documentary is on special effects and it shows you numerous flying tests that they tried to get the man of steel to fly. Some are really bad and some are funny, but in the end, they figured it out. Flying is just one part of this documentary, they also go into matte painting, rear projection, front projection and many other techniques that were new to the biz and even effects that had never been attempted until this film. It really shows you the innovations that this film achieved that would set a precedent for future films to come. There's a lot more stuff in these documentaries but I think I'll just let you discover them for yourself.<br />There are ADDED scenes that were not shown theatrically but that are edited back into this \\"director's cut\\" of this dvd version. Most of them are throw away scenes or \\"bridges\\" for other scenes but I can't for the life of me figure out why they cut out the \\"FIRE AND ICE\\" sequence in the original theatrical version. It's fantastic. I also got a kick out of \\"little Lois\\" on the train.<br />There are 2 deleted scenes, that don't add much to the movie and I can see why they were deleted, but I did laugh at one of them.<br />Some of the deleted scenes and the added scenes have been shown in expanded tv versions of this film but if you have never seen them, they are quite a treat and it's just good to have them in your home in such a high quality dvd transfer.<br />The alternate music scores I didn't get much out of and I doubt you will either unless you are a big follower of music scores.<br />The commentary by Director Richard Donner and Creative Consultant Tom Mankiewiczwas was great. You could tell that these two really had a lot of fun making this picture and a lot of love for the final product. They told some great stories on their troubles filming certain scenes, how they hired certain actors and even giving kudos along the way to the behind-the-scenes folk who helped out. There's some great insight on this commentary on how much hard work it really took to get this picture made. Tom has a great memory and seemed to tell a lot of \\"little things\\" that even Richard Donner had forgotten.<br />The trailers and tv spots were cool to see and they brought back definite memories, including a teaser trailer that I remember way backwhen, that caused roars of applause from the audience.<br />If you have even a little nostalgia for this film, you are going to love it! Some of the effects don't hold up in this day and age , but a surprising number of them do! I found myself thinking to myself \\"how did they do that back in 1978?\\". The answer: By Hand. The story is timeless and even though today's younger audience might be jaded with all of today's computer wizadry, I think this movie stands the test of time. Just the EXTRAS alone make this disc worth it. After watching this film, you too will believe a man can fly ... I know I did ...<br />ENJOY!
0345347951|5.0|&quot;Childhood's End,&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke, is a science fiction novel with a truly epic scope and vision. This classic blew my mind when I first read it many years ago.<br />In the novel, the people of Earth witness the arrival of the Overlords, a highly advanced extraterrestrial species. The Overlords establish a seemingly benevolent rule over the comparatively primitive humans. But these powerful aliens remain shrouded in mystery. What is their ultimate agenda? Ultimately, the novel reveals the ultimate destiny of the human species.<br />&quot;Childhood's End&quot; has some almost Lovecraftian touches of terror and mystery. But on the whole I find the novel to be mind-expanding, and oddly inspiring. And the Overlord named Karellen is, to me, one of the most enduring creations in all of science fiction. This book is essential reading for serious readers of science fiction.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Yes, it's a classic.  Yes, it does belong in any serious library of pop music.  No, it might not be what you are expecting.  It does not have the hooks or gee-whiz production wizardry of the oft-compared Sgt. Pepper's.  It is not like anything the Beach Boys did before or since.<br />What it is, is a very fine listening experience.  Make no mistake, these are VERY strong songs from start to finish.  I bought it looking forward mainly to Wouldn't It Be Nice, and God Only Knows, but keep coming back for That's Not me and Here Today.  These songs really have a way of getting hold of you.<br />This release also features some excellent liner notes that help you to get a feel for the time, and for the production of the album.<br />P.S.  I had the distinct privelege of attending a Brian Wilson concert last summer featuring the performance of this album in its entirety.  Marvelous.
6305169187|2.0|&quot;Armageddon,&quot; directed by Michael Bay, marks a new low in sci-fi/action cinema. The film tells the story of an oil drilling crew, led by Bruce Willis, which is recruited to blast off into space in order to help stop a killer asteroid from destroying the earth.<br />The story is both stupid and unbelievable. The script is full of cheesy, embarrassingly unfunny attempts at humor. The obligatory romance between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler is a waste. The action sequences are far too loud and chaotic; they seem like something conceived by hyperactive 4-year olds. And ultimately, the film goes for cheap, manipulative sentimentality, rather than believable emotion.<br />&quot;Armageddon&quot; is not a total waste. The hard-to-swallow story at least held my attention. And Steve Buscemi (in a supporting role) has a few fun moments. But overall, this is a disappointing film.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|If you've been listening to the radio lately, you've probably heard the new version of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. Well, ladies and gents, that's just a tease...<br />I've been anxiously awaiting the premiere of Moulin Rouge since December and just by listening to the soundtrack, I can tell that Baz Luhrmann will not dissapoint. Hats off to Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor! They take all the iconic pop ballads and add their own dazzle and, dare I say, make them better! Kidman's breathless version of &quot;Diamonds are a girl's best friend&quot; with a dash of &quot;Material Girl&quot; is raunchy, bubbly and fun, while her cover of &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot; can only be described as heartbreaking. Ewan McGregor has stolen my heart with his cover of Elton John's classic &quot;Your Song.&quot; He has an amazing beautiful voice. Both stars make the love theme &quot;Come What May&quot; an instant hit, full of longing and passion. And the &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; will never be lived down - a mix of every soft-rock love ballad plus classic rock as a conversation (&quot;All You Need is Love&quot; + &quot;I was made for loving you&quot; + &quot;One More Night&quot; + Pride(in the name of love) + &quot;Don't Leave Me this Way&quot; + &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; + &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot; + &quot;Heroes&quot; + &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; + Your Song) YES, ALL THOSE SONGS IN ONE!  <br />The disc is rounded out by David Bowie's dreamy-nightmare version of the Nat King Cole classic &quot;Nature Boy&quot; along with rock songs reinvited by Beck and Bono and a breathtaking tango version of &quot;Roxanne&quot;. There's techno as well - Fatboy Slim's version of the can-can and a dangerously beautiful track called &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot;. <br />Now I'm wishing this film came out tomorrow, but the most important thing is this album stands on it's own two feet - and can dance as well!
B000003TAW|5.0|As someone who is more of a Pop/R&amp;B and hip hop fan, I'm going to go out on a limb and throw in my two cents for this album. Here it goes...<br />Back in 1994, I went through an &quot;alternative&quot; phase. I found myself enjoying music by the Smashing Pumpkins, Stone Temple Pilots (especially), Live, and some random singles here and there (like Candlebox and Collective Soul). Near the end of my phase, I heard a new song debut on a San Francisco radio station (Live 105) one August morning, and it was called &quot;Undone/The Sweater Song&quot;. I Loved it. Immediately, I took note, and kept my eyes and ears open for more Weezer material...<br />Next came &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;. The song was ridiculously catchy, and it sounded nothing like &quot;Undone&quot; (hey...variety!) and the Spike Jonze clip for the song was definitely fun to watch. I immediately borrowed the album from one of my friends at school. I was simply amazed at how consistently good Weezer's album was; absolutely no filler tracks whatsoever - at least in my opinion.<br />The songs that I still enjoy to this day (despite the fact that my alternative/rock phase is over) are &quot;The World Has Turned And Left Me Here&quot;, all three of their singles (&quot;Undone&quot;, &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot;), &quot;Holiday&quot; (my absolute favorite song on the album) and &quot;Only In Dreams&quot; (what a long, yet perfect song...)<br />I guess the reason why I wrote this review is because...to me, really good music has the ability to leap out of its respective genre and attract just about anyone with an open mind, and an open ear. I'm very much looking forward to hearing Weezer's new material; by all accounts it's more of the melodic, sing-songy material that made this album such a classic.<br />Thanks for reading.<br />Knyte.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I thought that this cd was much more mature than her baby one more time cd. BOMT(baby one more time) was another i love you and you love me back cd but Oops was another story. she was basically making a sequal with oops by saying you cheated me and i don't need you anymore. I thought that oops i did it agian was a great album. Unlike BOMT. she has fast paced dancing songs rather than ballads. I would greatly recomend this album.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|How this work is showing up at less than a full 5 stars is beyond me.  I wonder how many copies have sold though, because most Beatle fans already own everything they ever did already.  Still, I owned nothing of theirs on CD, so I immediately went for it.  As I listened, of course memories of a &quot;carefree?&quot; youth came back to me, and as the music played on I started to think &quot;Man, each song just gets better and better!&quot; This is a great collection to help one experience the Beatles and their growth as composers and musicians over their meteoric career.  Too bad it ended so soon, as I feel that the four guys together  were better than the sum total of their parts. (Lyrically and musically)
6305728437|5.0|This was the second movie in Disney's recent succesful group of movies. By sucessful, I mean well done and enjoyable. Hercules, Mulan, Tarzan...etc. Mulan especially had one of Disney's first strong female characters that wasn't a princess, or a peasent girl who ends up BECOMING a princess...etc. She wasn't deprived of love, or care, or anything, but she still was motivated to be strong. Mulan was a wonderful movie, especially for young girls, because even though Aurora, Snow White, Ariel, Belle and Pocohantas are good rolemodels, Mulan is more of the 'every girl' . Everyone can see themselves in Mulan. I think that this is one of Disney's best movies, an amazing tribute to the children of America, giving them this opportunity to see History, while watching a fun movie.
B00005AXEL|5.0|The Witchey sound of Stevie is back,better than ever.I love the first single,\\"Every Day.\\" If you've seen the video ,and Stevie on David Letterman,you would swear she's from another planet.The women is more beutifull than ever,and so is the voice.The cuts I can't stop playing,\\"Sorcerer,Everyday,\\"and \\"Bombay Sapphires,\\" with Macy Gray on vocals and Stevie on Keyboards.The one number that really gets to me,\\"I Miss You,\\" with Lidsey Buckingham on Guitar.I think about all the people that have died,or have gone out of  my life.I hope its released as a single next.Every cut is unique,just like Stevie.You'll want to play \\"Trouble in Shangri-la\\" over and over again.
B00000J6AG|1.0|Sounds like a Volkswagen commercial. I don't like Volkswagen commercials.
6304696515|3.0|First I have to say, this is probably my favorite movie of all time. The acting, (with the exception of Keanu Reeves.) can not be beat! The cinimatography is awesome and the score brings it all together. But, this DVD is not the quality I expected. I bought a DVD copy of this movie in February and was disappointed to find it wasn't the best transfer. My VHS version has a better picture. It was obviously transfered from poor quality print of the film, or poor quality video. There are several scenes that have white splotches that pop up. And, what looks like there may have been scratches on the film. I just finshed watching the copy I received today, and all those flaws were on the new copy also. I would only recommend this to you if you don't have the VHS version and are going through withdrawls. Otherwise save your money until Warner Brothers gets serious and cleans up the DVD some.
B000008COG|1.0|AC/DC started a almost unbeliavable decline after &quot;FLICK OF THE SWITCH&quot;. In their actual live act, there is not even one song from the albuns &quot; FLICK OF THE SWITCH&quot;, &quot;FLY ON THE WALL&quot; and &quot;BLOW UP YOUR VIDEO&quot; ( the three were released in sequence). Only in &quot; THE RAZORS EDGE&quot; some songs stayed ( like &quot;THunderstruck&quot; ). SO, can someone say this is a great album? THis is the worst AC/DC album ever, it should even bear the name of this sacred band !!!
0767802470|5.0|The anti-war movie genre has a number of must-sees. Das Boot is one of them.  Watching the directors cut for hours on end, watching the crew's struggles and ultimately the ending is a perfect war movie experience.  Das Boot is a war in microcosm, the hype at the beginning, the struggle in the middle, and the futility throughout.  What a great show.
1559409010|5.0|Excellent comedy.  As a 15 year-old Python junkie I stole into the theater with a friend to see the premiere of LOB in 1979.  I distinctly remember the barking and howling which accompanied each scene.  Anyone who is comfortable in their faith will find this movie hilarious, as it skewers human nature not religion.  For the rest of you I can only repeat the wisdom of Brian when dealing with an ex-leper lamenting the loss of his livelihood...&quot;there's just no pleasing some people&quot;
B00005B6C9|5.0|The title song, which opens the album, is so subtle it took me by surprise. This is a CD for adults: beautiful songwriting, sophiticated emotional awareness, sly wit. The stunning polarized photos in the liner notes are spot on, capturing each Gibb's unique sensibility. (It's amusing to compare the printed lyrics to Robin's adlibs, esp in his own &quot;Embrace.&quot;) This album gets better and better on relistening, it sings rather than shouts.The brothers have not gone stale on us. Bee Gee fans, rejoice in this agile and contemporary music.
B0000026J1|5.0|It's definitely one for the collection. Great to drive to and lose your snowy white license. I reckon it's their best album and it has certainly kept many hard rock fans happy. If you're into 80's rock you'll love it. Difficult for younger generations to appreciate it though!
068484267X|1.0|This book is all about Irishmen and about the things that Irishmen hold dear. It is about drinking, which is something mics do and it is about potatoes, which are good foods for a mic to eat. But mostly, it is about drinking. A lot of Irish like to drink; hence the term drunken mic. Irishmen say things like, &quot;top of the morning to you, laddie, now where's my drinkypoo?&quot; Overall, this book was boring. It would have been better if they had had leprachauns and other dumb Irish stuff like that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go eat some bacon or something. Mmmm... bacon.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden is back and with an awesome album!  With Bruce Dickinson (vocalist) and Adrian Smith (guitar) back, they have made some awesome songs which resemble their 80's songs.  I really enjoyed the songs on this (especially &quot;Brave New World&quot;, &quot;The Wickerman&quot;, and &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;).<br />If you are just starting to get into Iron Maiden, this is a MUST-GET.  For us fans who enjoyed the old songs, this is a real treat.  =)
080017948X|4.0|I have to admit I do not own this particular DVD. Why? I have no idea. I should, because I stop and watch it whenever it's on TV. Then again, maybe that's why I don't own it. Well, whatever the reason, I can assure you of this, it is not because this is a bad movie. When this movie first came out I saw it twice. It has so many elements that are so perfectly suited for Murray and his comedic style. Since it's release it has been copied many, many times, but it has never been duplicated.  What would you so if you had to relive the same day over and over. Would you use your knowledge to take advantage of the situation? Would you eventually go crazy? Or would you use the time to better yourself? Well, pick up this movie and see what Bill Murray did with it. You won't be sorry.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I was unsure about this film being a sucess as the comic books had always been a sucess, and i didn'd think the film would be able to make the cross-over, but it did.  X-men is full of special effects and of the wonderful characters that brought the comics alive.  The fil is about Magneto who wants to convert all of the humans into mutants to stop the segregation and outing  of mutants who are then referred to as freaks.  The x-men have to try and stop Magneto and co from doing this as the machine that Magneto has devised for the conversion actually kills the humans. This film is worth a watch even if you are not a fan of the comic books as it has a good story line that is easy to follow, as it explains all about the x-men clan
B00000255F|5.0|\\"The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves\\"...&quot;tonight in Jungle Land.\\"  Thus opens and closes one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded.  Springsteen's third album, after \\"Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey\\" and \\"The Wild, The Innocent, and The E Street Shuffle,\\" \\"Born to Run\\" marks a dramatic leap forward for Bruce Springsteen, and an original style of rock and roll is born.  \\"Born to Run\\" was the album that propelled Springsteen from being a relative unknown onto the covers of Time and Newsweek magazines.  To my tastes, \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" is a greater album (I guess I relate more to its feelings of loss, regret, and well ... DARKNESS...then I do to Born to Run's rebelliousness, dreams, and innocence), but \\"Born to Run\\" isn't far behind.<br />Among other great things about this album:  an awesome violin solo in \\"Jungle Land\\" (by Suki Lahav) on a rock album, no less(!!); great lyrics (\\"in the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream\\", \\"baby this town rips the bones from your back,\\" etc., etc.); great characters (Mary, Terry, Eddie, the Magic Rat); a kick-ass band (Clarence, Roy, Danny, Little Steven, and the rest of the gang); great production/arrangement/sound; great themes (faith, love, values, struggle, despair, escape, redemption, etc.); great songs!<br />Is this a perfect album?  Maybe not (it can still feel a little bit forced/self-conscious/overly theatrical at times), but damn close!  Does it stand the test of time?  Definitely!  At the minimum, \\"Thunder Road\\", \\"Backstreets\\", \\"Jungleland,\\" and the title track are all all-time classics.  The other songs aren't too shabby either (actually, they're all excellent, some only a notch below classic), and a million times better than almost anything you hear on the radio today!  I mean, who would you rather listen to, Bruce or Eminem (or The Backstreet Boys)?  Hmmmm...that's a really difficult choice!<br />All in all, this is just one amazing album, from one of the greatest American musicians - Bruce Springsteen -- ever.  And this is the one that made him a star.  If you haven't heard the whole album, you need to do so.  So RUN, don't walk, to your nearest music store -- virtual or otherwise -- and get this album!greatest American musicians - Bruce Springsteen -- ever.  And this is the one that made him a star.

0316286850|5.0|I was in a play when I first became aquainted with this author/artist.  I played a somewhat minor role (No small parts, only small actors), so I spent the majority of rehersals playing tic tak toe and reading interesting articles in the Onion at rehersals.  One day, I was helping to clean the costume room (similar to an archealogicacl dig: there was about as much dust, and I think we figured out that some of the discarded skirts and masks dated back to 3000 B.C.).  Something white amongst the grey caught my eye immediately...I had soon uncovered this book.  One of the make up artists in the last play must have left it.  I darted behind a rack of musty, tattered dresses, determined to conceal my prize from the other cleaner-uppers until I had gotten a better look.  I cracked it open, and began flipping through.  I believe the director found me there, 45 minutes later, wanting to know why on earth I had missed my cue.  About thirty seconds into mid-lecture, she stooped down to see what the fuss was about and became as engrossed as I.  This book is not only innovative and creative, but fun!  As soon as I layed eyes on it, I wanted to try out some of the make up faces.  It shows, step by step, how to create everything from a bomshell blond to an emaciated but hopeful heroine.  The many different ways of using make up are truely ingenious, and I would reccomend this book to those who are looking for new make up techniques, for the independant actress, and for anyone who simply wants to try some of these out on a rainy day.  Try it out...you won't regret it.  But, if you plan on browsing through it while &quot;working&quot;, try to make sure your boss doesn't catch you.
B00004YKUY|5.0|This is an excellent cd, I bought and it has yet to leave my cd player, This is classic journey, the new vocalist is incredible he can sing every note that steve could and absoloutely takes those vocals to a new height. The words are outstanding, a well written group of songs, Neal sounds incredible as does the rest of the band, I recommend this cd to any journey fan of old and of new, great stuff.
0679882820|5.0|It's hard to find board books that strike the right balance.  Many are so simple there's just nothing to them -- you don't really get to settle in for a nice reading session.  But abridged versions of longer picture books often lose the magic of the original.<br />Congratulations to the folks who trimmed &quot;Mr. Brown&quot; down to size.  It has a wonderful, natural rhythm -- even zippier than the original!  And my baby daughter LOVED hearing us make all the silly noises.  When she was 9 months old she'd already started imitating this book, wagging her finger bag and forth and going &quot;tick, tock&quot; like a clock.  Fun for all!
0806930152|5.0|This book is excellent for those artists who need practice drawing the human figure because the book has so many progressive pictures to look at and utilize. The section for &quot;hands&quot; is very good showing the artist, by example, how to go about starting each finger and on to the thumb and how to attach them to the hand. Each of the sections on the figure is self contained with several sketches with varying views (top, side,etc.) I have a hard time with specific components of the figure and this book has made everything very clear and helpful.
1573225517|5.0|But the film kind of put me off.  And I must admit, I love Jon Cusack.  Not sure how to spell his name, but...<br />Anyway, the book is much better.  Great insight into the mind of the male animal.  Makes a heck of a lot more sense in an English setting than in Seattle or wherever the movie was meant to be....<br />Funny, honest, touching, and pretty hip.  I am told that it should not be read in too close proximity to Bridget Jones Diary.
1558908382|5.0|When hit man Martin Blank (John Cusack) first receives an invitation to his ten year high school reunion he has no interest in going at all.  That is until he agrees to a contract in the same area.  Upon returning home to Grosse Pointe all Martin can think about is the ex-girlfriend (Minnie Driver) that he stood up on prom night.  Martin appears to be fixing their relationship until rival hit man(Dan Aykroyd) shows up in town to eliminate Blank.  For the first time Martin has to balance his job and a personal life.<br />At first I had no desire to see this film but after the first viewing it became one of my favorites.  Everything about this movie is great from the characters to the soundtrack, there is really nothing to complain about.  John Cusack is excellent in his role and actually makes the audience feel sorry and care about the hit man.  The supporting cast all fill their roles nicely (even Minnie Driver who I normally don't care that much for).  This is one movie that I could watch over and over.  Its a romantic comedy with a twist of action and is perfectly balanced.
B00004XQ83|5.0|(That's one of the few lines I remember from the original &quot;Odyssey&quot;)<br />The film and this astonishing soundtrack mingle the myths, dreams, and longings of all people.  There is a yearning in all of us to get back home, to eat well and sleep warm, to cheat Death for another year.  Homer had it down, as do the Coen Brothers.  And the music and musicians featured in this coundtrack have always known it.<br />To call this music &quot;roots&quot; is accurate, but somehow inadequate.  This is heart music, dream music.  It is the roots of all of us.<br />Homer invoked the Muses as he began his story of Odysseus.  Three thousand years later, the Ladies make a repeat appearance all through this soundtrack.<br />Take us on home...
B00004SCX6|4.0|Let's get one thing straight I don't like Britney, but I do like her music. A lot of people [criticize] her voice, and while I'll admit her voice is anyhting but magical I do think she has some talent. Stressing the word some. As far as the CD goes, I love it. There is a great message behind a lot of the lyrics \\"Stronger\\" \\"Lucky\\" \\"Can't make you love me\\" these are all great songs! I would advise someone to buy this CD, but for little kids or even Junior High the videos can create real problems!
B000001Y42|4.0|It's not that all of a great CD and is slightly overhyped but it is still worth a listen.  Most of the songs feature Fred Durst screaming...with heavy guitar riffs and a hiphop beat.  Many of the guitaring and bass lines sound [simple]...DJ Lethal barely plays part in the album unlike the other two where he is deeply involved with the songs.  DJ Lethal only does his scratching and turntable work at the end of each song as the guitars fade out...   All this is in each song.  It can get repetitive and a little tiring which is why the rating suffers.  However, the band only spent 3 days recording this album which is why i give it a 4.<br />The overall sound quality of this album is very poor for modern times.  The distortions and mediocre skills make them sound like a local garage band.  <br />However, with all the negative points mentioned above, i have to say it's still enjoyable to listen to a bit.  Songs such as Pollution, Counterfeit, Sour, Faith, and Stuck are all great songs to listen to.  Sour is one of my all time favorites here.  The rest of the songs are mostly a bunch of short 2 minute demos.  The very last song seems like filler.  It's 16 and a half minutes long and was just improvised the whole time by the band.  Very poor work in the last track. <br />This band got lucky thanks to KoRn and Ross Robinson.  But they've managed to show their skills with time and if you enjoy listening to Limp Bizkit, then this album is good for you.  It's not the best but you will get a taste of what Limp Bizkit once were before becoming more in line with Rap and Hip Hop.
B00003CXS4|5.0|conceptwise it's a lot like &quot;Lock, stock&quot;. It's very funny and also sometimes very violent. Colorful characters and a great soundtrack. Brad Pitt is hillarious as an irish gypsy.  Do not miss!
B00001NFCY|4.0|I was fortunate to buy the CD with bonus tracks.  But the tracks aren't really that important.  The main 11 tracks are all you really need to enjoy this album.  <br />Although i disagree with the fact that Creed has ... bands sound like Pearl Jam, there are some pretty stereotype riffs here that all bands share so it's nothing really new.  <br />There are some songs in here that are kind of boring to listen to and need that extra OOMF in them but it's still good.  Probably like one or two that are like that which you'll find.  <br />In my opinion, My Own Prison was a much better album.  But this one still has it's good points.   Still, if you like rock and want to avoid cuss words and vulgarity for a while then this is a great album to purchase.
B000005HLV|5.0|<BR> Definitely lives up to the hype. I got into Mayhem via Cradle Of Filth and the difference is staggering. Those riffs are some of the creepiest ever written, and the solo in &quot;Freezing Moon&quot; ranks as one of my favourites. I must say that Hellhammer's drum performance was better on &quot;Grand Declaration Of War&quot;, but Attila Csihar's vocals are also excellent, and come up well in comparison to Dead's earlier efforts. The production is huge and intimidating and black as hell, which is helped by the way they mixed down the bass lines.<br />Bottom line; this album is one that proves virtuosity is not always necessary to make a really great record.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Wow.  I was just stunned when i heard this CD.  The upbeats and hip-hop riffs on the guitars off Tracks 2 and 3 begin to give you grooving on your seat.  It continues with re-arranged...a nice arrangement.  Track 7 features Fred Durst, Jon Davis of KoRn and Scott Weiland from the STP.  Together, all three create a powerful song.<br /> Almost all the songs here are worth a listen here.  There are one or two songs that get boring to listen to after a few times but none of the music here is terrible.<br />Of course, the style has changed slightly more hip hop compared to Three Dollar Bill...  But still, Limp Bizkit managed to become successful without selling out unlike what most people say.  The band have continued to experiment further with rap with N2 Gether now.  And unlike the first album, DJ Lethal plays a better role here.<br />The fear that Limp Bizkit wouldn't last after their debut album has been turned the other direction here.  This is truly a great album for any modern day rock fan.  Go out and get it.
B000005HN6|5.0|I like the attitude that Scandinavian Black Metal bands exude, much more than their music, which is typically dull and uninspired, derivative, flat, etc.<br />Not Opeth. Opeth are on another plane. While it is true that they may start out with Norse Black Metal as a template, within the _first_ song on Orchid they quickly expand the form decades ahead of anything their contemporaries (Or most other bands in rock) could ever do. Again, just within the first song!!!<br />You have to hear this music. Agressive, soft, beautiful, manic double bass and wailing guitars, Bass lines that have no place being associated with Black Metal at all (1) You can hear them. 2) They don't just double the guitar for the enitre album). Plus, the lyrics are intellignet. A possible first for the Genre. Opeth dealing with human issues (Albeit put through a Metal filter) unlike most other blaack metal/grindcore/death stuff. Nosongs about chtonic syphalitic pancreas' or whatever on this disk.<br />I cannot recommend this album highly enough. If you have a taste for heavy music at all, you will like this.
0805062971|5.0|You haven't read a book like this. And you really, really need to.    Blame the millenium for the rash of New Age Thought books out of late (Celestine Prophecy, Ishmael, etc.), all promising to explain to you in narrative exactly why your life isn't turning out the way you thought it would. Fight Club isn't at risk of being lumped in with that lot, mainly because so many people who read this are going to misunderstand it.(hence movie reviews dismissing it as pointless homoerotic violence.) The medium is the message here, and to that end Chuck reinvents the concept of prose narrative. The storyline is less a narrative than it is a mural; a series of images and vignettes layered one on top of another to reveal the meanings &quot;under and behind and inside&quot; the mind-crushing mundanity of this, the American Nightmare. Each event, each dialogue, each bone-crunching scene is focused like a magnifying glass in the sun, like tallows in boiling fat, until pure meaning comes out. This prose isn't flowery, it's visceral. The ideas, consequently, hit you like a foot to the gut when you've never been in a fight. It changes the way you see things. It affects your with ideas you hadn't thought of, and wish you had.
6305718954|1.0|You know what I love about this little morality play, oh sorry-MOVIE is that it is SO INCREDIBLY SUBTLE, wow, you had to look really, really close to see the message. Are you getting my sarcasm? good cause I'm laying it on thick. (a quote from Tommy Boy, an Oscar contender compared to this heap) Uh, do I really need to say more?  What a typical load of crap this country pours out, I can just hear the studio heads yelling:  &quot;Lay it on thick guys, they love it when you smack 'em across the face with it!&quot;
B00005K3NY|4.0|Unfortunately I cannot comment on the DVD, as I have yet to get it. Although I am happy that it is finally getting the DVD Treatment!<br />Just saw this 1981 classic from the Cronenberg. Very scary and has some of those eecky scenes that the director is well-renowned for. I just thought after watching this film that this movie was so ahead of its time. I was born in 1981 and saw this today afternoon in 2001 and still enjoyed it immensely. Clever, gory, great score from Howard Shore (a little melodramtic at times but excusable considering the age of the film) and &quot;Scanners&quot; has Micheal Ironside in it as the most powerful Scanner of them all.<br />There some real memorable scenes in the film especially the one in the conference room when a scanning demo goes all wrong and the last act. I have seen &quot;Scanner Cop,&quot; the spin-off of the original, and thought that film to be very good too. Highly recommended. Just not right for the squeamish...!
B00004RF98|5.0|.... Gene Kelly is absolutely wonderful in the &quot;Gotta Dance&quot; number, especially in &quot;Singin'In The Rain&quot;. Debbie Reynolds is unforgettable. If your feeling depressed, get out there and buy this happy energetic movie. You will not regret it! ....
630542845X|5.0|When i first saw this movie in juneof last year i was very moved. The simplicity of Powders life how he has always known life just to be his grandparents farmhouse. Then suddenly being trusted into a strange new enviroment, and having to deal with the cruely and knowing that people fear him because they don't understand what he has been though. He is the most human and intelligent person you'll ever meet. But, in the end Powder knows that most people are not ready for him to be there because of his ideas and his gifts. So, he had to go back to wherever going back is or more like going out sending his energy out. But, hopefully he will be back someday to more open, caring, and understanding people.  I recommend this movie to anyone is really get you where the heart is. Watch it with a open mind because it does get deep into the human aspect of live and philosophy.

6303314015|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about eight, back when it first came out, and I loved it.  Now I'm sixteen, and it is still one of my all time favorite movies!  The animation is beautiful, the music is breathtaking, and the story is moving.  I think I love this movie more now than I did when I was younger.  Little kids will like it, but I think that older kids and adults are in an even better position to appreciate the message.  I'm sorry I can only give it five stars!
0871137380|4.0|There is an inherent tension between military professionals and the journalists who attempt to document their campaigns, and it is significant in this light that Black Hawk Down has gained acceptance by the US Army in its Command and General Staff College as a graduate level resource.  The reader will understand why within the first twenty pages of this book.  Mr. Bowden's description of the Mogadishu battle, his treatment of the paticipants, and his general conclusions are unusually thorough and balanced.  For a journalist his discernment regarding military issues is uncommon and refreshing.  More important, he is successful in unpeeling many of the new complexities of modern urban warfare that are evolving with the evolution of surveillance sensors, weapons, and elite forces and tactics.  This is a challenging frontier of military science and the Mogadishu battle is documented in sufficient detail to reveal a number of tactical, operational, and cultural issues confronting commanders and troops in the urban battlespace.  The Somali side of the conflict is also explored, with detailed accounts of Somali participants and their motivations.  Mr. Bowden's journalistic objectivity cannot, however, fully conceal his contempt for Clinton/Albright geopolitical incompetence -- a perspective which remains a powerful undercurrent in the American military.
0800129806|5.0|I am a high school student, and we watched this movie in my English class when we studied about King Arthur.  I loved it!  While it does have a somewhat different storyline than the actual legend, I liked the movie's plot better.  I especially loved its interpretation of the characters of Arthur, Guenevere, and Lancelot.  Arthur is portrayed as a noble king, Guenevere as an independent lady, and Lancelot as a wanderer who is a little rough around the edges but is basically a nice guy.  The movie focuses on the love triangle involving Guenevere, Arthur, and Lancelot.  You feel for all three of them as you watch Guenevere and Lancelot try to sort out their feelings for each other when they know that they must not act on them.  The movie's ending is different from the one in the traditional legend, but I liked the movie's ending better.  Not totally accurate, but as long as you're not worried about that, a great movie!
B0000028RR|5.0|My favorite band of all time is now Rage Against the Machine. This album is, as stated in my review title, possibly the greatest album ever. Now, I don't mean, like the best metal/rap album or hard rock album, no. I mean one of the greatest albums EVER. Period. I mean, Tom Morello is possibly one of the greatest guitarists of all time, Zack De La Rocha stinks, but that's not the point. Tim C. is a great bassist and Brad Wilk is a great drummer. Every song on this album is incredible and should be listened to about 40 times. A few of my favorites off of this album would have to be Take the Power Back, Bombtrack, Killing in the Name, Wake Up (this song got me into Rage), and Freedom. Every song is incredible, but these are just some of my favorites. Buy it now, today, do whatever you can, just get this album right now. Also get every other album by Rage, even Evil Empire which might not be as good as their first, but almost nothing can top one of the greatest albums of all time.
B000002H1T|5.0|Everything comes full circle! Ignore the people who call this purely &quot;commercial!&quot; It's back to the roots and success of the first album! Hard and cranking!!!! Do yourself a favor, add it to your collection, it's MAGIC!!!
0440133688|4.0|In reading Shem's masterpiece on the trials and tribulations of the intern year it made me reflect on my own thoughts of what medical school is like.  His books gives a fairly pessimistic but very realistic view of medicine and how doctors often times look at patients.  At this point in my career(MS2 soon to be MS3 once I pass boards) I still am fairly idealistic about medicine and the opportunity to work with and help people.  This book upon first read(before medical school) shocked me such that I believed that Shem was writing complete fiction which was not founded on reality at all.  After two years through I see that he has made some very clever and perceptive assertions and am starting to see what he is talking about.  Although I still have not bought into &quot;the only good patient is a dead patient&quot; mentality.  I still feel too idealistic for that.  Catch me after two more years though and I may have a very different opinion.  <br />For all of you who are not in the medical field this is an excellent book that provides nice insides to the behind the scenes of medicine.  For those of you in the medical field it might shock you how right and accurate he is with his descriptions.  Regardless, this book is provacative and a quick read.  I definetly recommend it and hope you all enjoy reading it as much as I did.<br />--Joaquin
0375501851|4.0|This is an interesting, complex, informative, and often highly amusing novel.  Its rich allusions to the historical foundations of various cultural prejudices represented by the diverse disapora of Britain's colonies residing in London is depicted in an insightful,  characteristically wry, sardonic, English manner.  Satire coupled with trully wise insights about human interactions and about how the past often shackles people and prevents them from savoring the present makes this a substantive as well as entertaining work.  Interwoven is a intricate and clever plot -- the combination is pretty noteworthy for a 24 year old author; she reflects a maturity beyond her years. <br />I found myself often reminded of Hanif Kureishi's &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot;.  Zadie Smith, like Kureishi, notes how immigration has resulted in a British society that is more like a salad bowl than a melting pot.  Americans who have angst about our own failures in fully integrating people of diverse cultures as one society will find this parallel experience particularly interesting.
B00005AR3G|5.0|This movie was sooo funny, David Spade was perfect for the voice of the Emperor.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good laugh.
B000006NUW|5.0|Simply put, if you're looking for non-stop musical enjoyment from one of the best record labels of all time this is the package to get! Tons of hits with a few rarities thrown in to give you a good taste of the remarkable talent that resided (more or less) in Detroit. Thank you, Berry Gordy!
B00005B6C9|4.0|I probably hadn't listened to any BeeGees music since the late 60's and early 70's when I was a big fan, except for what was incessantly played on the radio and in clubs during the disco days.  But after watching the fantastic A&amp;E special, I was literally blown away by the breadth of their career, not to mention that their voices have never been better (I actually have watched that video of that special at least six times so far, because it puts me in a great mood and I really need that lately after work).  <br />However, I was a little disappointed by the new CD, but only in that the production is just too slick and perfect (and those awful photos!).   They are so good live, but this CD was so different from even their live performances of the same songs on A&amp;E, and I think it is primarily because the CD was overproduced.  There is something to be said for imperfection on a recording and their voices live are sublime to begin with.  And is it just me or is this CD just too loud?   I can't seem to turn the volume down low enough to hear it well without being blasted by the sound level, and even tried it on 3 different stereo systems.   <br />But I do love many of the new numbers, particularly the title track, She Keeps on Coming (is that Robin singing, it doesn't really sound like him?) and Sacred Trust (a lovely song that would be just perfect sung at a wedding for a couple tying the knot for a second time or at an anniversary party).<br />P. S.   Can't quite figure out how someone could mistake it for the Moody Blues like another reviewer wrote.   I bought the Moodies latest recording, and the songwriting is definitely not the best of their career.   You really can't say that about the BeeGees, can you?
0440234743|5.0|John Grisham really out did himself when he wrote this novel.  The book really gave me a look at how hectic and unpredictiable life in the law field really can be.  This novel was actually recommended to me by a friend, and let me tell you that once I started reading, I could not set the book down.  It's truly a work of art that grabs your attention in the first few chapters.  John Grisham's style of writing is truly absorbing, and believe I that at least 92% of the people who have read this book will agree with me.
0446677450|1.0|I found this book not about wealth creation or getting rich, but a self-help stylized memoir of learning about money.  It is woefully short on practical ideas and actions, and provides little outside of broad generalizations and rantings.  <br />In my view, &quot;Get a Financial Life&quot; combined with &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; were far more educational with ideas and strategies that were readily applicable.
B00003CX8V|4.0|The Apartment is one of Cameron Crowe's favorite films, as he has said in writing, and it is obvious to anyone who has seen both The Apartment and Almost Famous. The comparisons are many but the key comparison is in the central role of the woman with a big loving heart being used by powerful men, being treated poorly and discarded. The attempted suicides are parrellel in both the way they play out and their positions in the dramatic structure of both films. I don't want to list all the details but wanted to point this out to anyone who might enjoy looking at the influences and the development of a great work in relation to another great work. All best.
B00003CXMG|1.0|I do not understand all the hype with this movie. This was one of least entertaining movies I have ever seen. People who liked this movie have nothing better to do than watch paint dry.
B000002JS6|5.0|I had a punk rock upbringing, and while that introduced me to a lot of great music, it also meant that I missed out on a lot of great music. When I was younger, I thought that I couldn't like AC/DC, because they were &quot;hesher music.&quot; I was wrong, wrong, wrong. AC/DC are leagues beyond teased-hair poodle-metal. In reality, &quot;Back In Black&quot; is all-out classic rock and roll, a logical extension of what Chcuk Berry, The Rolling Stones, and The Who were doing before AC/DC. I'm sure by now anyone reading this knows the story of AC/DC, so I won't get into that. What I will say, however, is that if you do not own &quot;Back In Black,&quot; you owe it to yourself to buy a copy. If &quot;Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution,&quot; then AC/DC are a pine-tree air freshener.
B00000IJPU|5.0|This album must be rated as a collection of hit songs, since no single studio album by any metal band can even get close to this album in terms of quality. But as a selection of best songs, and especially Iron Maiden songs, I must say it could have been made better. But still, it features 16 excellent tracks, perhaps your favorite tracks are missing, but you can't put everyones favourite Maiden songs into a single CD, and not into three or four CDs either. Most masterpieces are included here including The Number Of The Beast, Hallowed Be Thy Name, Run To The Hills, The Trooper, Aces High, 2 Minutes To Midnight, The Wasted Years, The Evil That Men Do, Fear Of The Dark, and others as well. But there are a few tracks most of us would agree to change with others: Can I Play With Madness is a good song, but Iron Maiden can offer much better songs from their resume, and the same goes with Be Quick Or Be Dead and Bring Your Daughter... (perhaps they wanted a song from each album?). The new song, Virus, makes this a must have for serious fans, as this is certainly a strong track, which was not released on any album before (although it is now released as a single). I would like to see one or two more tracks off Somewhere In Time and Piece of Mind, and what about Killers? There is not a single song off the album, and that's a pity.<br />But overall, this is a strong collection of excellent songs, since all of them are excellent after all, and a must have for any metal fan who doesn't own at least two or three Maiden albums.<br />If you've got all other Iron Maiden albums, it is still worth having for the new song, Virus. The artwork is beautiful as well.
B00005221L|4.0|&quot;The Most Dangerous Game,&quot; to which Predator bears a remarkable resemblance is a literary classic and mandatory reading in most ninth grade English classes. So the question arises, why is that story held in such high esteem when this picture is cast aside as mindless tripe? I suppose having Arnold Schwarzenegger's name above the title and Joel Silver's in the producing credits doesn't help, but don't get me wrong I'm not suggesting this movie should have been showered with praise from critics, or awards from Academy members.  But a pat on the back for one of the finest action directors working today (John McTiernan of Die Hard fame) might be nice, especially considering this film isn't nearly as dumb as people would have you to believe.<br />Schwarzenegger stars as the leader of an elite commando force sent into Central America to retrieve U.S. hostages being held in guerrilla hands.  Little does he or anybody in his team know (with the exception of Carl Weather's character) that they're actually being manipulated into assassinating a group of Communist dissidents and thorns in the thorns in the side of the C.I.A.  This is the only the first back-stabbing and leads to a quite harrowing and action packed combat sequence that wouldn't have looked out of place in Platoon or Saving Private Ryan.<br />While all this is going on, comsuming more than a half hour of briskly paced screen time, we still have yet to see the alien.   McTiernan utilizes a clever tactic orginated (or at least to the best of my knowledge) by Steven Speilberg in Jaws by shooting from the predator's point of view.  By doing this we only get glimpses of the monster, as he has the ability to turn himself invisable at will, which makes the final confrontation all the more terrifying.  Also noteworthy is Kevin Peter Hall as the villainous creature who is a constant menace and manages to make a very impressive impression even though we never see his face.<br />For about the last hour of the movie he stalks Arnie and his rebel company, picking them off one by one as is customary in these kinds of films.  To me the parrallels to &quot;Dangerous Game&quot; are quite obvious, simply substitute an alien in place of the hunter who preys on humans.  The symbolism of the book and the movie is quite clear, or at least in my mind, and is that hunting for sport is inherently wrong.  But even the predator has a code of conduct that human hunters have yet to adopt, he doesn't take advantage of another species inferiority or good nature.  To me, being as I'm such an animal lover, I'd root for the alien a lot sooner than I would Ted Nugget or his band of ignorant rednecks.<br />Now I'm willing to concede that maybe I'm so intent on justifying my appreciateion for this film that I might be imposing onto it hidden meanings that aren't really there, but even if that is the case it does little to depreciate my enjoyment of one of the most exciting science fiction movies that I've ever seen.  Sure the acting is merely adequate and the writing could use some sprucing up, especially in fleshing out the characters a little more, but the directing is superb and the finished product is about as good as anything you have the right to expect considering the genre.<br />And that's not to mention the special effects.  Done by Stan Winston, who won recognition as being the best in his field after his work creating the digital dinosaurs in Speilberg's Jurassic Park, he does an equally impressive job here.  The &quot;creature features&quot; never get too corny and at the same time aren't so good as to distract from the rest of the film.  It's a fine line to walk and I can't think of anybody who does it any better.<br />This is the second four star review I've given a Schwarzenegger movie in as many months (the other being for True Lies) and I'm quietly coming back around to being a big fan of his early work for the first time since I was thirteen.
6301966015|4.0|I read Antonioni's &quot;That Bowling Alley on the Tiber&quot;, and being impressed by his written thought I looked for some of his films.  &quot;Blow Up&quot; is the one most likely to be in your local video store.<br />As cultural history (or mythography) it's priceless.  Some people see Austin Powers in it; myself, I keep expecting the Avengers.  Mrs. Peel in a catsuit (or Tara King in a miniskirt) would be right at home.<br />Visually it's delicious.  The thin flanks of English girls rolling around in a huge sheet of purple paper, our hero (chest bare and hairless) helping the delivery man bring in the enormous propeller.  Noisy mimes sweeping through London like locusts.  A roomful of Mods staring silent at the wailing Yardbirds. The cinematography is perfect.<br />So what's the point?  What's the point of all the murder-mystery setup if we're not going to have an explanation?  The point is, naturally, that there is no point.  In 1966 this was shocking and important.  In 2001, there's the sense that we've been through that revelation and come out the other side (&quot;My parents went through an existential crisis, and all I got was this lousy NASDAQ&quot;).  But that doesn't mean that we don't need to be reminded now and then.  And if nothing else, it's refreshing to remember a time when the meaninglessness of existence and the indeterminacy of truth were still thrilling and scary, rather than vaguely problematic bits of the background scenery.<br />See it.
B00000JHAU|5.0|Really, it's quite obvious: Belle and Sebastian's If You're Feeling Sinister contains some of the riskiest pop music made in the 1990s. Certain loquacious, &quot;ironic&quot; North American female artists have repeatedly shown us that artistic intent can poison even the best intentions. The stakes are high when one chooses the rocky path of self-acknowledgment - over celebrated arrogance and self-importance - upon becoming public property. <br />If You're Feeling Sinister, the Scottish band's sophomore outing, is their wayward stab at making their music public property. Their first album, Tigermilk, was effortlessly smuggled into the so-called indie-rock ghetto as an infamously limited vinyl release. Although it was re-issued in 1999, an original printing of Tigermilk sells at the tune of a couple hundred dollars. <br />Many bands work with the safety net of studio magic, remedying weak lyrics and derivative songwriting with post-production tricks and compulsive dial-noodling. On If Your Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian do not. It is the sheer dexterity, ingenuity, and surprising aplomb of their songwriting that makes the album such a compelling work. Its ten tracks showcase keen lyricism, symmetric melodies, and patient musicianship. The opening track, &quot;The Stars of Track and Field,&quot; is a quiet, troubled ode to the beautiful that exits in the clamor of crashing cymbals and swelling brass. &quot;Seeing Other People,&quot; a track set adrift by a piano arrangement stolen straight out of a Peanuts television special, languidly narrates the sadness and confusion of post-relationship exploits. &quot;Me and the Major&quot; is a sober generation's diatribe - it reaches hilarious heights, yet remains stubbornly relevant. However, the title track, &quot;If You're Feeling Sinister,&quot; is the album's undisputed centerpiece. A testament to the moral hypocrisies raised by authority, religion, and the media, it races to a comic conclusion that &quot;chances areyou'll probably feel better/If you stayed and played with yourself.&quot; The intrigue of Belle and Sebastian's lies in their lead singer, Stuart Murdoch. Murdoch's plaintive, disarming voice (which curiously evokes 1960s folk singer Donovan) and his acutely humorous, literary lyrics reveal the immutable characteristics of a pop enigma. <br />While the dust settled around the overwhelming response to If You're Feeling Sinister, the idiosyncratic band launched a PR campaign that can be summed up by a flurry of idiosyncratic singles, idiosyncratic T-shirts, and idiosyncratic buttons. In addition, side projects (the bands Looper, the Gentles Waves, and the publishing of a novel) by various band members followed suit. The band also managed put their current record label (Jeepster) and their like-minded labelmates (Salako, Snow Patrol) on the map, and spearheaded a summer festival. What this all means: Belle and Sebastian are here to stay. Wear your heart on your sleeve and buy this album.
B00003CXDB|5.0|The quote from Gekko says it all.......<br />&quot;  Greed Is Good &quot;<br />And in a sense that is what this movie is all about, to some degree.  The opening titles to such a fantastic city as New York is matched in size and demeanor with Frank Sinatra along side singing.  <br />Stone's masterpiece follows really the rise, and very big fall, of Bud Fox ( Played by Charlie Sheen ).  Sheen is a coldcalling, struggling broker at a securities firm in NY with the aspirations of being &quot; The Elephant...The Player &quot; on the other end of the phone with the money and the power to call all the shots.  To get there however is a totally different affair all together...  In short, not to give too much away from this fabulous movie, Fox chases the golden ticket by persistently calling the self made Wall St. legend Gordon Gekko ( played fabulously by Michael Douglas, the thought of Richard Gere in this role is ridiculous now! ).  <br />Fox's persistence finally pays off with Gekko taking him in and teaching him the in's and out's of the insidering trading game, &quot;  The most valuable commoditity I know of is information &quot; quotes Gekko and it is exceptionally true in society at any time perioid.  <br />This masterpiece of a film really pays homage well to the yuppie, bull market era of the 80's.  I remember the 1st time I ever saw it and the fast paced desire it gave me to want to be a trader in New York, buy buy!! Sell sell!  A lovely fact of this movie is that fact that is hasn't really dated that much, the clothes, cars, computers and haircuts are about all that really date it.  <br />On the technical aspect of it, the picture is wonderfully clean and crisp in almost every scene.  The sound, the Dolby Dig 5.1, feels abit synthetic...but after all this is a movie that was made in '87 years before 5.1 was ever a thought to movie makers.  However, it's not a action movie so the sound should not matter as long as you can hear the dialogue.  The documentary about Wall St., and the commentary by Oliver Stone, are wonderfully inciteful and worth viewing at least once if not more.<br />On the whole the disc is a MUST own.  The story and the characters are what drive and enthrall you in this movie.  Douglas's performance alone as Gordon Gekko is worth the price of the disc to see again and again....
B000021XS0|5.0|The very first time I sat and listened to this CD from start to finish, I was left speechless. The instrumental &quot;Overture 1928&quot; is one of THE best instrumentals I have ever listened to. And from there the CD only gets better as the story that the music tells gets started.For anyone who has not even listened to a single Dream Theater song, this is definitely one to check out, especially for those that are music fans in general and enjy listening to all types of music.This is a GREAT concept album. The storyline is basically about a man who is haunted by a woman who was murdered some 70 years earlier, but the subject matter also deals with reincarnation, which makes it a little more interesting.It's really difficult to single out any tracks as better than others since they all fit together as one, however....&quot;Home&quot; is a terrific standout tune, as is the instrumental &quot;The Dance Of Eternity&quot; which has some tripped out time changes. &quot;The Spirit Carries On&quot; is a beautifully, yet, haunting song.James LaBrie, the lead singer, truly does an outstanding job on this disc, and along with Portnoy, Rudess, Myung and Petrucci....well, just take a listen to this CD for yourself and you will hear some of the most unbelieveable playing of what could arguably be the most talented band of the modern era.
0452281881|5.0|This is a great book. Provides an insightful look into the dog-eat-dog world that is advertising. I read it all within a day, just could not put it down - a laugh-a-page kinda book. Beaumont puts together the happenings of this ad agency via e-mail correspondences between the various people at the agency. Get it! It certainly cheered up my day.
B000002HPT|5.0|For one reason or another, &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; seems to be one of the more unpopular releases among fans of Dream Theater....at least that is how I understand it.Well, maybe I'm too soft, but I feel this is a GREAT cd. The first track is real addicting.....&quot;New Millennium&quot;. The second track, &quot;You Not Me&quot;, seems to have a kind of commercially sound to it.However, the highlight of the whole CD in my opinion is the beautiful ballad, &quot;Take Away My Pain&quot;. Talk about a tear jerker.The last song is a 13 minute epic, &quot;Trial Of Tears&quot;, written by the bassist, John Myung.I will admit though, if you have heard any of Dream Theater's other recordings first, such as &quot;Image &amp; Words&quot;....then &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; may take a couple of listens to really get use to. This is totally different from what Dream Theater has ever released. Yet, it is still a great recording from these Masterminds of prog-metal.
0767819446|4.0|Not the best &quot;What Is Real&quot; movie, but interesting. If you don't like dark movies or science fiction, then this may not hold your attention. Not as well executed as Matrix, doesn't pose the questions that The Truman Show does about the nature of human existence, not as troubling as Dark City. Still, mostly satisfactory. Unfortunately, the plot twist becomes quite obvious well before the final &quot;Aha&quot; moment. Well enough foreshadowed that anybody who's survived eighth grade may well see it coming. Still, sufficiently satisfying to be worth watching.<br />If you enjoy this movie, you may also enjoy Jack Chalker's Wonderland Gambit series, starting with The Cybernetic Walrus. While reading that book, I kept thinking of this movie--not that the scenes are similar, but the concepts start out close ...<br />Five stars for visuals, three stars for making it too obvious where it's going to end, four for the plot.
0451169514|5.0|It is my favorite book I've ever read. The characters are so real. That alone just scares you. Not to even mention this book is freakiest thing i've ever read. I first read it when i was ten or eleven. I can't remember in my old age (16). I read it twice though when i first got it. Not back to back but there wasn't a huge gap in between. I would recommend this book to anyone who like long and GOOD books. You feel when your finished with it that you were actually there with those seven kids. I think after I finished with what i'm reading now i'm gonna read this book again for a third time. I have seen the movie but there's no way you can fit 1100 pages into a 3 hour movie. It did a good job though for the time given. Anyways, this is a must read for anyone that likes King at all.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I am listening to this CD without skipping any songs.  I find her songs comforting and relaxing.  It's good to sit down and just listen to her melodic voice.  This CD was worth the money.  The last song however, makes me want to dance.  Great music for a newcomer.
B000000OTU|5.0|I was a bit disappointed that both Dream On and Walk This Way were not included in the album. However, the CD still rocks. I love to crank up the volume whenever \\"Love In An Elevator\\" comes on! \\"Dude Looks Like A Lady\\", \\"Janie's Got A Gun\\", and \\"Ragdoll\\" are also songs that I like to [turn it] up!
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead has done it the best this time around.  Many will argue that the album sucks because other artists have had a similar sound before them, but, then again, Nevermind (especially &quot;smells like teen spirit&quot;) sounded like the pixies, and it was still awesome, and managed to change the music world.<br />National anthem is the best song, and has killer base.
B00004Z511|4.0|One of my friends went out and bougt the new Radiohead album one day.  On the way home he stopped by my place, so I ripped it into the computer, planning on listening to it later.  I did, and at first, didn't get it.  I didn't understand what it was, I didn't understand Radiohead. When I was in 5th grade, a relative of mine took me, as a favor to my parents to an Alanis Morisette concert.  I didn't like Alanic Morisette, even then.  But it was who opened up for Alanis that caught my attention.  It was Radiohead.  Of course, this was before OK Computer, but they still sounded pretty cool. I forgot about them, until 5 years later, when Kid A came out. This album is completely off the wall, and in such an awesome, inspiring way.  Each song, individually has an effect on me, but listening to the whole thing through is just mind boggling.  The way this CD opens up, Everything In Its Right Place, is just such a great song.  It was the first song that I paid attention to.  Iditeque, Optimistic, and How To Disappear Completely also came across as unique and great songs.  I also love The National Anthem, with its driving bass line that I can never get out of my head. I don't like new music, or anything that is played on the radio, but Radiohead earned my respect with Kid A.  It was a new album that was actually good, one that didn't make me feel like shooting myself for listening to.  It turned me on to OK Computer, which I still can't completely put into words.   Thanks to Thom and the rest for contributing to the new pop scene something that is actually listenable.
0553213105|5.0|I was forced to read Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; as an assignment in my British Literature class.  Though it was not a voluntary thing at first, it soon became one.  I could kiss my english teacher for making me read this!  I read it in three days, hardly stopped to put it down, it was so engrossing.  After reading it I promptly went out and watched the 5 hour A&amp;E movie (Colin Firth is to die for, and it stays truer to the book than any other movie I've seen thus far).<br /> Austen's writing style is brilliant and has such a nice, familiar tone that even though she is poking fun at much of society, she was probably quite fond of her characters.  Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine, was a wonderful character and is by far one of the most real fictional people I have ever had the pleasure of reading about.  I love how her relationship with Mr. Darcy changes gradually and his true character is revealed.  My only wish is that sequels were in style then and Austen had thought to right one or simply make the book longer.<br />I had to read this book because it is a classic.  However, I would recommend this book to everyone, not because it is a classic, but because it is such a beautiful story with 3-dimensional characters who will pull you into a world you will not want to leave.
B00005AXEL|5.0|So I'm in the record store to buy Janet's new one and there on the shelf was Stevie.  Needless to say after hearing both I left the store with Stevie and have listened to the infectious tracks over and over.  Listening to Janet's I was dissapointed that her idea of maturity is lacing her disc with bad language.  I have no problem with four letter words and use them myself but hearing them out of Ms. Jackson is like Stevie doing a cover of a Backstreet song!  Stevie on the other hand is an icon of maturity and magic and this CD is true to form.  Listen to it twice and see if you can't catch yourself thinking about bombay sapphires or being too far from Texas at work.  How many CDs do you buy where the artist actually spent more time WRITING and nourishing the material than learning dance steps for a video?  Many of the songs begin where older songs left off.  There are shades of Gypsy and Gold Dust Woman among others and the story continues.  I especially like the voice, writing, guitar focus and ambient noise like on Planets of the Universe. I can't think of many artists including my favorites who put so much of their own heart and emotion in their music and do it so selflessly, like they are really not doing it to pad their already rich bank accounts.  When the writing is so personal you expose yourself to critisism of your lifestyle and choices as is the case in a few reviews (very few) of this album.  Just as you wouldn't expect a priest to sing about marital relations you shouldn't expect Stevie to write about anything less than her own lifestyle which is obviously quite different than the average Joe, or Jane as the case may be.  If I were rich I'd buy this CD for you, until then get it you won't be dissapointed
B00005B6C9|5.0|Although I didn't experience the instant fascination with this album that I have with previous ones, it is truly delightful. Just the fact that the brothers have produced yet another album, with more new ideas, enhanced with hints of the past, is quite amazing. Not only do they thrill us with new sounds, but there is a continuity which reflects their past works that is sure to please every devoted Bee Gee fan. The whimsy of &quot;This is Where I Came In&quot; is such a familiar quality of each album.  The melody of &quot;Wedding Song&quot; is so reminiscent of the beautiful song &quot;Stay Alone&quot; of &quot;Now Voyager&quot;. The typical sensitivity and gentleness that the brothers frequently express so profoundly in their work is expressed once again in the spectacular &quot;Just in Case&quot;. &quot;She Keeps on Coming&quot; reminds us of the very early days in the Bee Gees' careers. And I dare anyone to try NOT singing along with the catchy &quot;Sacred Trust&quot;.  Although I don't care for &quot;Technicolor Dreams\\"  it is definitely a new sound for our very talented trio. If this incredible showcase of talent is not enough for you, don't forget the wonderful enhancements of the CD and the beautiful photographs of the lyric booklet. Enjoy!
B00004T9UF|4.0|Well Eminem's sophomore album doesn't have the same impact as it's predecessor in my opinion.<br />On &quot;The Marshal Mathers LP&quot; he doesn't have the idea of who he is..some tracks he became Slim Shady, that funny alter ego who yells, cuts and slices everyone and sometimes he's claiming to be Marshal Mathers himself and because of that this album is more personal, Eminem talks about serious issues and he's not joking.<br />Fortunatelly the production provided by Dr.Dre helps a lot,once again you don't have to press fast foward but probably you'll miss Slim Shady...<br />I think the best track is &quot;Stan&quot; as a matter of fact it's his best song and the beat is great!! I like it that Dido girl.. she sings very well!!<br />So Slim Shady meets Marshall Mathers and the result is another tight album and the reason that I don't give 5 stars is just because he's getting twisted about who's who..but anyway if u like Eminem go buy it...don't expect a good vibe on this one!!

0375703764|4.0|I had first read about this book in a review in Newsweek. I felt that this would be an overhyped book that completely sucked. Boy was I wrong. Only a few authors can actually write a book that is funny, but scary. Interesting, but not boring. Danielewski was able to accomplish this. From the beginning essay by Johny Trudant to the &quot;actual&quot; story of the Navidson family that lives in a house that can only be described as hell on earth. But the real grabber that this book has is how Navidson is the...well I don't want to give away the ending. The only reason why I gave this book a 4 was because I couldn't get over the fact that there are unneeded issues that I ,or any other reader, should know. Who really cares about all the art scetches that filled up about two or three pages that could have been used to explore thae relationship betwen Navidson and his family, especially Karen Green. Or it could have been used to explian why the family doesn't get out of the house before the Hollyway team massacre or anything else. So the plot is good, the book is effectively creepy, but the ramblings from a new(but good) author keeps it from getting to the point. And that is where the book fails.
B000002J1H|5.0|Going for The One stands as Yes's apex.  Preformed by what I believe to be the best Yes line up, Anderson, Burford, Wakeman, Squire and Howe are the quintesential Yes Line up that has not as yet been surpassed.  Going For The One is the most under-rated Album in Yes's storied history. This album exibits not only the groups  ability to collaborate in a way that most bands can only dream of, but as individually each member shines as this is a culmination of a band that has truely geled as individuals.  I fell the most underrated song on this most under rated album is Turn of The Century.  I have seen Yes many times and I seen Wonderous Stories preformed, but never this masterpiece, Turn of The Century.  This song the combination of Andersons voice and Howes guitar are a perfect compliment to each other.  What really shines is Howe's searies of runs. To this day I have yet to hear any other guitar player play with the fluidity and stamina that is required for this piece. Asolutely the best Yes song ever put down in vinyl or plactic, and if you are a Yes fan, not owning this disc you are cheating yourself out of what Yes and thier music was at thier apex.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Without the need of getting too wordy or descriptive, let me put it this way: If you are a &quot;true&quot; Stevie Nicks fan or fan of the 70s Fleetwood Mac, then don't hesitate - Buy this C.D. That's it! Simply put! Another Nicks album sure to be a classic. As a matter of fact, this is among her best work yet. Of course, how could she go wrong with production work from the likes of the gifted Sheryl Crow. I have always been a fan of Fleetwood Mac with my favorites of the Mac Clan being Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie. Let's face it - they each have their own, unique styles. But, this Stevie Nicks CD really knocked me out. Pure perfection! After years away from the recording studio for a full-length album, Stevie has turned out her most musically mature and emotionally moving effort to date. (Thanks Stevie! Now, how about you getting back into the studio with Lindsey, Christine, John &amp; Mick! It's amazing when you are doing your own unique thing, but it's magic when the five are together!)
B000058T5E|5.0|If you play guitar like I do you will be going back to the practice room after listening to this!  Jeff Beck is the best guitarist in the world, and this album just goes to show that he is also the most diverse.  Techno, blues, rock, you name it, it's here.  There is not a sound that Beck cannot get out of his fingers, Strat and an amplifier.  It is not only that Beck is the best, but he is continually reaching for new plateaus that no one else has even thought of reaching for.  <br />Not a techno fan I was a little disturbed before I bought the album, hearing that it had a lot of techno on it, but...it's Jeff Beck!  And that means incredible guitar, incredible sound, perfection!
B000003BDJ|5.0|The Stones just as I remembered only way better. No longer on a little rinky-dink turntable in my room but now on a digitally remastered cd and my dream sound system. The love for this music has lasted through out the years and to be honest I haven't bought any Stones material since the late sixties. This cd brings me back to rock n roll when I was a teenager.I put this cd on the changer and slapped on the head phones and realized I hadn't forgotten the words to the majority of these songs- great fun. I don't care how old you are buy this cd you won't be sorry , every song on this cd was a hit for an amazing band.

He gives an interesting biography and story of the research of many mathmeticians through history who contributed to the solving of Fermat's Last theorum, a list would leave too many out. Never getting bogged down in numbers but also never being ambiguous, this book does not require any deep background in number theory, Singh fills the gaps for you (i followed having only completed one year of college calculus, and even that was not important). Highly reccomended for anyone interested in math puzzles or a fan of Singh's work.

B000058T5E|5.0|You Had It Coming has me wetting my pants every time I listen to it. Every song is great. Earthquake, Roy's Toy, Left Hook, Suspension....there's a song on here for everyone. <br />Rollin' and Tumblin', Nadia, and Loose Cannon are the climax of this album (tracks 4, 5, and 6). Imogene Heap compliments Jeff's guitar playing well on Rollin' and Tumblin'. Jeff shows his mastery of the guitar and how massive of a tone he can get on Nadia. Beck shows us his haunting and arabic, yet totally Jeff Beck-like phrasings in Loose Cannon. The soloing at the end of Left Hook is so fast and smooth it makes you sweat. This album is better then Who Else and Guitar Shop, and is up with BBB and Wired.
0804115613|5.0|To fully immerse yourself in this book you need two things: a quiet place to read and a lazy afternoon with no interruptions. With these you will be transported into the lovely, quaint town of Whistle Stop, Alabama. Here you will meet numerous interesting folks such as best friends Idgie Threadgoode and Ruth Jamison, wanderer Smokey Lonesome, wise and nuturing Sipsey and easy to please Big George.  This book never really does decide what time period it wishes to be set in, it just wavers back and forth, mostly between the late 1930's and mid 1980's. Fried Green Tomatoes captures the essence of the human spirit and shows what the epitome of love and friendship really are. The words will jump out at you and stay with you forever.
630528069X|5.0|First of all,... Zeus is not a dry cleaner, Simon is not Russian. And to all those... that said the second Die Hard (Die Harder) was a good movie, they need to be locked up and forced to watched Die Harder until they have a phsycotic episode.... Remember, there are only small scripts, not small actors. Now about the first Die Hard. I have faith in my review because I have watched Die Hard no less then 75 times, possibly more, over a period of time. Some may say that some movie points are physically impossible. One such point is the problem of how McClane (Willis) supplies his 9MM pistol with the seemingly endless amount of ammunition that he uses to kill the majority of the terrorists. If you know anything about guns/ammo, you'll know that the gun all but two of the terrorists use is a 9MM MP5 sub-machine gun. That means it fires pistol bullets at an automatic rate. Simply put, that means when McClane wants to drop the bulky sub-machine gun, he can just empty the ammo from the MP5 magizines into the clip of the pistol he always has. A lot of the reviews I read mention the &quot;extra&quot; characters (mainly Dwane Robinson) that don't belong in movie. Gene Siskel himself said this. I know that I don't know more about giving movies a quality rating then Gene Siskel does, but I belive Dwane Robinson and any other &quot;extras&quot; help move the plot along, and provide a deeper storyline. A scene I CAN agree is cheesy and very impossible is the one where the last terrorist gets killed. I thing I learned while reading reviews is not to spoil major plot points, but I will say that that paticular terrorist could not possibly still be alive to get shot again. I may be being partial, but by the time that part in the movie comes, if you're an action fan like they come, you'll be so hyped that you'll need to watch it as many times as I did to notice that it's not possible. In fact, you probably won't even care! The whole last 15 minutes is extriemly exiting.
B000002HRE|4.0|Alright.  this album.... really wasnt that bad. actually it is really good. I know all the &quot;old&quot; metallica fans dont like this album cause they think that they're sellouts. I know this because i used to be one, i remember when i first bought this album i hated it, could not stand it and threw it in my sellout pile. But just about 1 week ago i sat down and listened to it. i havent listened to the damn thing since it came out which was in 97 or 98? i cant remember. but i found out i reall like this album. Now that i like this one, Load has even grown on me. and for all you people that dog the solos, come on. honestly how many of you play guitar? i actually do, ive been playing for 2 years and the solos on this album arent bad. i agree that they're not as intricate but they are NOT bad. you may not like this cd at first but just give it a chance, it might grow on you. it did on me!
B0000248L1|5.0|Alice in Hell, along with Never, Neverland are definitely staples in any Metal diet.  This debut album came along with the passion and intensity to get the attention of true guitar worshippers.  The outstanding rhythms rival those of early Exodus, Testament, and even Cacophony.  I stepped away from the metal scene for many years but always found myself pulling out the old cassettes from Annihilator.  I'm glad that I can find these two classics on CD and would like to say that if you haven't already you need to check them out.  Alison Hell is (in my opinion) the best track Annihilator ever released.
B00003CWN3|5.0|Boys don't cry is a powerful portrayal of the life of a young woman experiencing sexual identity crisis. Based on a true story it depicts the events in the life of Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) offering a thought provoking insight into alternate lifestyles. It delves into the human psyche and combs the inner labyrinths of the human mind to discover some shocking truths very rarely dealt with in the real world. It confronts our deep-rooted fear of accepting the unusual and laments the prevalent intolerance and prejudices that very much are a part of our lopsided system of morals and social conduct. It broadens our horizons and provides us with a more compassionate view towards alternate lifestyles urging us to question the existing hypocrisy and social taboos and view our moral stand in a different light. It is the story of stoic courage, the courage it takes to make a choice and stand by it; the courage it takes to be yourself fighting all odds and overcoming the gnawing fear of rejection. It is the story of hope, of love, of gaining triumph over all your fears and doubts to emerge as the person you want to be and live as. It is also a saga of pain and suffering caused by constant rejection and the clash between the inner spirit and that tamed by the society. The narrative begins as a forthright and moving portrayal of the confused mind of Teena Brandon who feels like a man trapped in a woman's body. As we start understanding Teena Brandon we are introduced to a group of wild, self - destructive youngsters living everyday in a drug - induced stupor. This becomes Brandon's newest circle of friends. Here Brandon also finds true love when he meets Lana (Academy Award nominee for best supporting actress - Chloe Sevigny). For the first time in his life Brandon finds himself embraced by a person who loves him defiantly and accepts him completely with the earnest compassion of a true soul mate. This sets off a bizarre chain of events and as the narrative gathers momentum the stage is set for an intense climax to explode. The culmination of this very powerful drama is shocking, unnerving and thought provoking all at the same time. Hilary Swank renders a heart-warming performance for which she won the Academy Award for best actress. Chloe Sevigny is charming with her lucid acting style and fluid grace.
B000003KMM|5.0|Seeing how this movie was made in 1989 I swear this could have been the true story of the Cleveland Indians. Cleveland Stadium was falling apart. 1,200 people would show up for week night contests, leaving 75,000 open seats. In 1987 the Tribe graced the cover of SI only to finish dead last. The fans always thought the Tribe might leave (but it was the Browns who ultimately said goodbye). After all this was the club that in 1974 had a ten-cent beer night that turned into a full scale riot. Any number of these players could probably be any one of the countless characters that graced their preence down by the lake from the late 60s to early 90s. Is that Super Joe Charboneau I see in Rick Wild Thing Vaughn? Could be. Gaylord Perry as the old pitcher who puts snot on the ball.... You tell me.  This is an authenic snap shot of those years where it was awkwardly fun to watch the Tribe. Even though tis is supposed to a comedy the end is quite emotinal. Only mistake was using County Stadium in Milwaukee. It's no Municipal Stadium.

B00005A1PR|5.0|i first heard india arie when she came out on the bamboozled soundtrack with 'in my head' and 'can i walk with you,' and from those first listens i knew she had talent.  she's since gone on to blow up with 'video,' and from listening to the rest of this album, it looks like miss india arie has staying power.  she has a gorgeous...soulful sound mixed with funk and smooth r&b, holding her own against neo-soul artists such as amel larrieux, angie stone, macy gray, erykah badu, and the superb jill scott.  her positive messages of identity, strength, spirituality, & faith make her a definite treasure in today's radio hip-hop/r&b market of 'money, cash...dubs, sippin' crystal,' etc.  some highlights include:<br />'simple' - simply sublime & my favorite track on the album. exquisite lyricism layered over an edgy beat. <BR> 'video' - just about everyone's heard this already.  positivity at its best.  <BR>  'butterfly' - sultry & funky.  the epitome of neo-soul.

This 20th Anniversay Edition is really a gem!!!
B00003CXSP|5.0|Too many people have gone into this movie with the expectation of watching Silence of the Lambs rehashed. I haven't ever anticipated a movie so much, and I was very nervous that it wouldn't live up to my expectations. It exceeded them.<br />Hannibal cannot be compared to Silence because they are completely different. Silence was a crime thriller, while Hannibal was suspense and a little romance. The motivating forces are different, as well. In Hannibal, there is no race against the clock to save the day. The pace is very laid back, and the story unfolds in its own time.<br />Returning to the lead character, Anthony Hopkins delivers a performance as good as I've come to expect. In Silence, we didn't get to learn much about Hannibal, because he was behind the glass for most of the movie. But this is his movie, and Hopkins does it well. He's not as scary as he was in Silence, but that was ten years ago, and he's mellowed out a lot. Don't get me wrong ... he's still scary. But he can also be a lot of other things as well. <br />Julianne Moore replaced Jodie Foster, and to tell you the truth, I didn't miss her. Except for the scene with the recordings. But other than that, Julianne Moore was truly excellent. I had always liked her as an actress, but this movie made me truly respect her abilities.<br />The score by Hans Zimmer is absolutely beautiful. It's been a long time since I've bought a movie soundtrack, but this one was worth it. I really hope there's an isolated score on the DVD. <br />All in all, it is a very entertaining movie. There's a little bit of everything, from suspense to a little horror to romance. Just remember, it's not Silence of the Lambs.
6305313687|5.0|There is a lack of good movies currently but this one doesn't fit that catergory.The movie basically has 3 or 4 scenes that caused it to be rated R bu three of these scens hit you with such a force that you wil lfeel sick and will have a lump in your throat for hours to come.The first scene is a sex secne (one reason it was rated R) but the scene is more of an opener to set the tone.Derek (Edward Norton) is interupted by his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who tells him of a few black gang members breaking into their car.Derek in what at first should have been self defense instead of just stopping them from robbing him instead goes on a rampage and kills two of the three gang members.The second one was still alive when Derek took his head,put i on the curb,and smashed it with his foot.Te scene is horrifying and just shocks practically anyone.The movie is through the eyes of Danny and through most of the fist half of the movie you sense that the movie is glorifying NAZIs,Racists,etc but that is just the picture you need because that is the way Danny is thinking.With his brother's release from prison,Danny realizes Derek is no longer the same.Prison changd Derek and the prison scenes were another reason why this movie has a very strong R rating.Derek is no longer a young,stupid,NAZI wanna be.Through the movie Dann y talsk of his memories.It seems that what Derek was saying involved thougth and logic,a very scary thought to have being that his movie is not so far from fiction.The movie is excellent but it is not a movie for everyone.I do not insist that you watch thi movie when you are feeling very happy because yu will be very upset within the firt 10 minutes of the movi.AMERICAN HISTORY X has a shocking and unexpected ending that will leave you shocked,horrified,scared,and undoubtedly very glum.        The acting is excellent.Edward Norton has proved himself a much better ator than any of the actors he has been in movies with (Brad Pitt,Ben Stiller,Woody Harrelson,Richard Gere,Woody Allen,etc).Edward Furlong too adds great acting, bt he stars in a role ver similiar to his in the movie Little Oddessa).There aren't many people that can play these kind of roles and Furlong and Norton both did greeat.Norton made his character seem so real..This is a great movie but it is very dark, I suggest you rent this movie before you buy it based on what peopel say.
B00004R99K|5.0|Although there have been many film versions of Lewis Carroll's classic story about Alice's adventures in Wonderland, Disney's 1951 animated version is by far the best.  The &quot;Alice&quot; stories themselves are timeless classics that deserve to be passed down from one generation to the next, and this film deserves to be handed down along with those original stories.<br />&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is by far the best animated film to ever come from the Disney studios, and is easily one of the most magical and imaginitive films ever made...period.  I still remember the first time I saw this cinematic gem when I was around 3 years old, and have loved it ever since.<br />I also now own the Disney CD soundtrack which contains not only all the wonderful songs from the film, but also the entire original, and extremely delightful, instrumental pieces heard throughout the film.  (By the way, any LP version you might happen to find of Disney's &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; soundtrack is simply an imitation with re-recorded versions of the actual songs heard in the movie.  The recently released CD/Cassette version I'm referring to is truly the film's original soundtrack.&quot;<br />I highly recommend buying both the film itself, and its enduring original soundtrack.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed with either purchase.<br />&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is truly a wonderful, magical animated masterpiece that can be enjoyed by the entire family, both young and old.  I just wish that &quot;Di$ney&quot; would stop releasing the crap they're putting out now and try to regain the magical quality that left the studio after Walt's death.
B000002KD5|3.0|The first big step towards Pop from their English-Blues beginnings, FLEETWOOD MAC is the Christine McVie-dominated calm before the RUMOURS storm.<br />McVie's &quot;Warm Ways,&quot; &quot;Over My Head,&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me,&quot; and Nick's &quot;Landslide&quot; are the songwriting highlights here, a real showcase of female sensibility in a band previously known for heavy macho posing.  <br />The song everyone talked about at the time, &quot;Rhiannon,&quot; isn't really much of a song at all.  Buckingham's guitar work on the tune is fantastic--he's an underrated player--but there is virtually no melody in the verses and the lyrics are simplistic at best.  The song works because of the band playing it, not the woman who wrote it.<br />This was a big deal album.  Little did we know it was just a warm-up for their next LP, RUMOURS.
B0000047CW|5.0|Just a great CD to listen to when you want to relax and visit the places of yesteryear that are long gone but still preserved on CDs like this.
6300214559|5.0|I believe that although this film is not historically accurate, the emotions expressed through the brilliant acting far outweigh any negative aspects. Sadly, it is true that Queen Jane was executed for something she was unwilling to do and had to be manipulated into.  As the great niece to King Henry VIII and cousin to Princesses Mary and Elizabeth, not to mention King Edward, she should have been treated as a Queen, not some common criminal of the time. One of the points that really irritates me is that once Mary was on the throne she married Philip of Spain who turned out to hate her and resent her for her lack of childbearing ability and then she fanatically burned Protestants at the stake and by the end of her 5 year miserable reign, the people were praying every day for Mary to die so her half sister Elizabeth could be Queen.  Jane, if she had been allowed to remain Queen would have done a lot of good for England.  The costumes were brilliant as was the scenery and above all the music-it is so moving and so heart wrenching, I want the soundtrack so badly, could someone email me if they know how to acquire it-see email above.  I just think this film is brilliant because it emphasises the youth of Jane when she was forced to marry and become Queen, then a brutal execution following the harping of that twisted crow Princess Mary-known as Bloody Mary.  It was a tragedy and yet I think &quot;their souls took flight to the world that is invisible and there arriving are sure of bliss and forever dwell in paradise&quot;.

0060278234|3.0|I have to say that this book disappointed me. Unlike Sabriel, the action really doesn't begin until the very end of the novel. I felt like I was reading an advertisement for the next book, &quot;Abhorsen.&quot; &quot;Lirael&quot; exceeded nothing more than a set up for the third book. I also felt that the text dwelt on the self-pity of both main characters far too often. The &quot;Disreputable Dog&quot; did not seem as real as Mogget; rather, she was a bland, faithful, traditional hound. Another thing that bothered me was the resemblance between Sabriel and Lirael. It's almost as if they are the same character! The only difference is the degree of self-pity that Lirael experiences, and her background. Finally, the style in which this book was written did not seem as smooth or as real and vivid as Sabriel. Secondary characters were much more flat and two-dimensional. Although I have a lot of critism for this novel, I also have a lot to say in it's praise. It was very original, and brought us a new villain and a new focus. The Dead creatures that Lirael fights are unique, and different from those in the first book. The entire description of the Library in the Clayr's Glacier made me want to go there myself. It was extremely vivid, and offered a completely different setting from that of the first book. The magic was poignant and engaging. Overall, I would recommend this book; read it, if not for it's own personal sake, at least for the sake of the third book, &quot;Abhorsen,&quot; which promises to be absolutely stunning.
0452282152|5.0|After reading this book, I wonder what really went on in Delft in 1666.  Too bad we can't travel back in time to find out.  But I really enjoyed the way Tracy Chevalier imagined it.  This is a beautiful book.  The next time I walk by the print of &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; at school, I will know her as Griet.  And that's a comforting thought.
B00000269M|4.0|Bad was released as the follow-up to Thriller. There must have been a huge presure on Michael Jackson. He wrote nine of 11 songs on the album. Even though Bad wasn't as succesful as Thriller it still did pretty good around the globe, Bad sold 350.000 copies in five days during its first week of release in Britain and it stayed 38 weeks in the US top 5. Then he went on a world-wide tour to promote the album even further.<br />Wanna Be Startin' Something opened Thriller with an edgy track and so does the title track Bad. It was definitely a strong musically start. It had a catchy chorus /Because I'm bad, I'm Bad come on/You know I'm Bad, I'm Bad, You Know It/You know I'm Know come on, You knoe/And The world Has To Answer Right Now/Just To Tell You Once Again/Who's Bad/. I'll admit it might not be the most touching lyrics ever, but it's funny and catchy. It reached no. 1 in America and no. 3 in the UK.<br />The second track on the album The Way You Make Me Feel is probably the most cheerful song on the entire album. It's one of my favourite Michael Jackson songs ever. His voice against his multi-tracked background makes the whole tune perfect. The third single off the album. It reached no. 1 in the US and once again no. 3 in UK. Man In The Mirror is my favourite track on the album. The song has been described as more or less a gospel song mixed with pop. I remember seeing his performance of this song a couple of years back. Honestly it's one of the best performance I have ever seen in my life. The message in the song is sipmle; If you want to change the world you should start with yourself and if you are not happy with yoyrself there's a good chace you might not be happy with anyone else. Surprisingly it only reached no. 21 in the UK, but it did landed as no. 1 in the US.<br />Smooth Criminal is another highlight. Like Michael Jackson's Heartbreak Hotel there is also soundeffects in this track. The song would later appear in his movie Moonwalker. <br />Leave Me Alone was only to be found at the cd version of the album. Its layers of vocals give the song a perfect sound.  The song carries a very personal message from the singer and it's to be taken litterally. The song is a plea for privacy. It reached no. 2 in the UK though it was not a single in the US.<br />Dirty Diana is the rock song on the album. The song deals with a similar subject as Billie Jean. A woman is willing to sleep her way to get what she wants whatever that might be. It was released as the fifth single off the album. It reached once again no. 1 in the US and no. 4 in the UK. <br />There is a perfectly good reason why this album doesn't get five stars. There is some good material on the album though songs like Just Good Friends, Speed Demon and I Just Can't Stop Loving You are in my opinion just average songs. You would think a duet between Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder would be spectacular well it isn't. Speed Demon sounds too mechanical and I Just Can't Stop Loving You is a boring love song.<br />I would recommend anyone to buy the bad. There are some of Michael Jackson's best songs on it. Definitely worth listening to a couple of times.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I am a long time fan of Stevie and this is her best album yet. I got in on the preorder and have not taken it out of my CD player since I received it on May 3rd.
B00005AFVR|5.0|I am confused with the review that says that the Live set is better.  I bought this CD first and cannot stop playing it.  Just as an example, Badlands on this album has much more power here than on Live.  Much of the live turns of the songs are better here than on the original studio recordings, such as Two Hearts, JungleLand, and Atlantic City.  Anyone who does not like this album has forgotten how to love rock and roll.
B000002U8G|5.0|When I first bought &quot;Meddle&quot; only a few songs impressed me.  After I had listened to it for a while, it became AWESOME.  The music throughout the cd is just amazing.  There are cool effects everywhere on this thing(&quot;One of These Days&quot;), as well as great lyrics(&quot;Echoes&quot;).  My favorite song is &quot;Echoes&quot;, which lasts about 24 minutes, yet it never gets old. I like all of the songs on this album, &quot;Seamus&quot; is my least favorite, but it's still all right... &quot;Meddle&quot; just creates this mood, sit back and enjoy the Floyd.
0944379044|5.0|The Hobbit is an excellent work of fiction. However, many believe Tolkien's masterpiece was brought on by his severe heroin addiction. Clearly Bilbo Baggins is what he views himself as,a dillusional 3 foot tall man. Heroin makes addicts feel as if they shrink, and become thieves, stealing from loved ones to pay for their costly habit. When Bilbo steals the ring of invisibility, it's clear that he feels himself as invisible to his wife. I suggest marijuana.
B00005AAFS|5.0|when rammstein first came in the picture, i thought they would crash like scorpion. but when i actually listened to some of their stuff, it amazed me. the sound is different and is some of the best musak i have heard in a long time. they promised a more hardcore album, and they did it with mutter. awesome work by rammstein yet again.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Finally, an album that I eagerly anticipated has lived up to the hype and expectations!  Stevie Nicks hasn't had a &quot;hit&quot; in a long, long time; and her last album, &quot;Street Angel,&quot; was a disaster.  But this time around, Stevie and her producers got it right.  Of course, Nicks' melodies do tend to sound alike and here, particularly on &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La,&quot; and &quot;Planets of the Universe,&quot; one could probably superimpose her earlier lyrics, &quot;just like the white winged dove, sings a song sounds like she's singing, ooh, baby, ooh, ooh,&quot; right into the fold and not be out of sync.  Still, there's so much to absolutely love on this album and with each listen it gets richer.  Listen to the jewels in &quot;Candlebright&quot; and &quot;That Made Me Stronger,&quot; where the melody line takes and unexpected turn.  Other gems are &quot;I Miss You,&quot; and &quot;It's Only Love,&quot; the latter being just one of the most beautiful songs Nicks has ever sung.  The album closer, &quot;Love Is,&quot; is a stunner as well.  Stevie fans are probably rejoicing over this album.  Certainly, I am.
0312243022|5.0|I picked this book because it won a Pulitzer.  What a beautifully crafted story:  part biography, part fiction, part mystery, part ode.  Each character's story is engrossing in and of itself, and what a clever way to tie them together at the end.  I've been practically demanding that others read this book!
B00004RF9I|5.0|The last of the 3 great movies Paddy Chayefsky wrote in the 60's and 70's, starting with The Americanization of Emily, through The Hospital, and finally ending with Network about the dilemma and struggles of the individual within the great and powerful institutions of our times is simply brilliant.<br><br>I don't have to say anything more than what looked like outrageous satire in 1976 turned out to be Chayefsky reading tea leaves and telling us exactly where the convergence of corporate power, entertainment, and television news was taking us. It is screamingly funny as well.<br><br>As in all 3 of these great films, Chayefsky's center is an individual within the institution cracking-up and his breakdown is the catalyst that upsets the order of things and allows Chayefsky to rant his heart out at the madness he sees around him. Chayefsky was a mature man, and he wrote about the guilts and stresses and longings of mature men of accomplishment like no one else.<br><br>Here! we have two, the madman Howard Beale (Peter Finch)\\"I'm mad as hell...etc.\\" and William Holden's Max, the Edward R. Murrow era newsman being forced to knuckle under to the new corporate bosses played superbly by a weasly, cut-throat Robert Duvall, and a heartless, steely cold Faye Dunaway. That Holden in his confusion and despair has a hopeless affair with Dunaway gives Chayefsky an opportunity to comment on the sad withering toll taken in some long marriages and what he perceived as the hollow heart of the sexual revolution.<br><br>As always, Chayefesky's scripts are complex and have many sub currents and comments about the social scene of the time. He has absolutely nailed the corporate culture here, and has a great deal of fun with radicalism, which becomes a mirror image of hypocrisy. And Chayefsky was more than prescient when he saw that the worst thing you can be in America is \\"lousy on television\\" (nod to Dennis Miller). <br><br>As noted, the cast is superb, giving just! due in all departmentsto Chayefsky's beautiful script and language. Of special note, is the cameo by Ned Beatty as the Board Chairman of the gigantic multinational that owns the Network \\"they say I can sell anything Mr. Beale\\" thundering away at poor crazy Howard like a wrathful Jehovah. Wonderful.<br><br>This is a great American film. Its message is more true today than when it was written. That makes it timeless. A Classic.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall was my first Pink Floyd CD and I  beleieve out of all of their Cds the Wall is one of the best. David Gilmour's emotional guitar playing(I am a guitarist myself and see him as very talaented)and Roger Waters songwriting are both excellent. This is a must have for any fan of Pink Floyd.
0671721720|1.0|At the heart of every good sci-fi book is a good - and sometimes weird - topic to be explored. My favorite topics are : what if human is not a lone species in the universe, what if a parallel word exist, what if we can traverse thru time....and so on the list continue. With a wonderful topic in hand, author can expand it to the limit. Sadly, this book IMHO does not have a good &quot;sci-fi&quot; topic to begin with. The author present us with a woman-emancipation cause set far in the future, but the story is shallow and boring. The mention of science &amp; technology just happen here and there throughout the book, but doesn't convince me as a reader. Characters are black and white. It's like read novel about captain Hornblower in action deep in space. For those who love real sci-fi, please look at other else. For those who love war-action theme, you can try Tom Clancy, Larry Bond etc.
B00001SIES|2.0|this band is K-Mart Radiohead, there's no getting around that, try as I may to like this CD and feel like I haven't wasted my money.  There are some redeeming qualities like the single and only stand out song &quot;Muscle Museum,&quot; but this album has no depth whatsoever.<br />It's a good thing the boys in Muse make no bones about loving Radiohead cause they've used all pre- Kid A Radiohead material as a blueprint but instead of creative lyrics and risk taking musical ventures, they substitute cheesy lyrics and formulaic song structure.<br />The lead singer tries real hard with the Thom Yorke imitation and almost succeeds but uninspired imitation is really boring.  Don't get me wrong, he's got a good voice but my advice would be to develop your own style, it just gets more and more irritating especially towards the end of the album.  I found myself thinking...&quot;okay, this is the last track?  please?&quot;<br />I do give 'em an A for effort though...it'll be interesting to see what Muse does next, who knows?  maybe the next album will smoke this one and I'll completely change my mind about them. Right now I have the feeling these guys may be the route of &quot;where are they now?&quot;
B000001FA4|5.0|I remember first watching the &quot;pride&quot; video on MTV in 1984 and I was struck by how creative the sound was along with the shots of a raised bridge, and a smoke stack... This disc, showed me that you can escape your dreary world by looking within, and when you realize that the world that we live in is an industrious, polluted place, you can still capture beauty from simple things like a &quot;smoke stack&quot; or a &quot;raised bridge&quot;, by self understanding. This disc creates a sense of sad hope, and dark beauty if you really listen to it. I would say that it is not for everyone, but a person that can appreciate the world, and them self, will understand this disc after many an attempt.
0790730960|5.0|9 years had pass. Who needs to know how good or bad is this movie? NOBODY!!! But Who's gonna read this? Just a fan like me looking for other good comments about this great &quot;not sequel&quot; second Batman movie by Tim Burton. Or maybe a lost soul around. Well i have bought this DVD 2 days ago. I'm a fan, a real one, but I have seen it many times on the VHS that I wasn't hurry for buy it. But I finally did it. AND I have remember why I enjoyed this movie and Why sometimes I don't know which one is my favorite between this one and the first one. BOTH are my favorites. This one has elements than the first hadn't, but don't needed. But I think you know what I'm talking about. <br />My favorite secuence: I know that you don't care about my fav. But think about it, If you could resume a great movie in one secuence, which one could it be? In these case, the dance between selina and bruce when both discovers that they have in front to their most loved person but at the same time to their natural enemy. And with the words of Selina, &quot;Now that it supossed that we must start fighting? I know that I have seen it one of the most beautiful love stories in &quot;My&quot; cinema story.<br />The eyes crying of Michelle are simply poetry.
B00000HZFH|5.0|This guy (excuse me, sorry, the BAND) could save rock and roll.<br />...I don't know if I ever would have discovered this band at a time in my life when I really needed it.  Just bought the album, outstanding. I had never been exposed solidly to BtS and now I don't know that I could ever go back and not critique all my other \\"rock\\" CD's without comparing them to this unique and engaging piece of art.  It's got more layers than a wedding cake.  KILAS will get under your skin, without all the itchy rash.  They have such a unique sound.  Remarkable.  I'm so glad they've chosen to stay true to their indie roots (ie. Modest Mouse).   I'd have to say my fave songs are \\"You Were Right\\" (total lyrical tribute to classic rock) \\"Temporarily Blind\\" (solid indie hooks and jumps and his vocals- intensity) and \\"Sidewalk\\" (upbeat fun pop- gotta have your guilty pleasures). I highly suggest to anyone who is in the mood to try something new or someone who just happened to land on this page for no apparent reason...<br />It was fate.  BUY IT.
014028009X|5.0|Found book to be contagiously engrossing. Interesting that pronouns are exempt due to diary format, however, allows for a light, fresh approach to modern day Pride and Prejudice.<br />1:30 pm<br />Am staring at review screen attempting to think of witty and charming things to write about Fielding's novel. Going over a multitude of scenes in head to describe, but feel strongly that one must read book to fully appreciate Bridget's obsessive-compulsive sometimes daft character.<br />1:33 pm<br />Aha! Have hit upon excellent choice of words for review. Ahem. When first heard of Bridget Jones's Diary instantly thought as Cosmopolitan type top pick book for lounging in sun on hot days thus must be sleazy literature. After reading novel, feel very badly for such snobby presumptions and highly recommend book to almost anyone for a good laugh, a bit of insight into self, and an illustration of being single in your 30's.
B00005AAFT|4.0|A great cd, probably better than Sehnsucht. I liked Sehnsucht also; I bought that one by just looking at the cover and remembering the name Rammstein. Listened to it and really liked it. Now this album.. it's like the other one, but different. It's harder, louder and probably better than Sehnsucht!
B00003CXB2|5.0|First time I saw this film was the year it was released in 1962 ~ believe it was a wonderful motion picture ~ now that I see it again on DVD ~ know now how wrong I was  ~ this is a GREAT film.  But the real stars is the landscape (desert) shifting and whispering as it does and the score by Maurice Jarre.  Jarre's score is simply epic in sound, overwhelming in depth and has completely captured the time and place with every note and measure.<br />Even though Peter O'Toole (T.E. Lawrence) is the main character ~ it is Alec Guinness (Prince Feisal) and Anthony Quinn (Auda abu Tayi) whose performances give you the essence of the story and make it work, let's not forget Omar Sharif (Sherif Ali ibn el Kharish) when we first see him at the well, an impacting scene between him and O'Toole.<br />David Lean (director) did such a fantastic job, won the oscar for that year for Best Director ~ Maurice Jarre won for Best Score and Freddie Young for Best Cinematography ~ but once again was the landscape and score we remember so well!<br />If you enjoyed this DVD ~ check out the score on CD ~ &quot;Lawrence Of Arabia&quot; (Silva America SSD-1010) The Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Tony Bremner ~ digitally recorded with additional music.<br />Total Time: 227 minutes...Columbia/Tri Star...(2001)
B000002UR7|5.0|I always hear people saying how this is radiohead's worst album and really doesn't deserve recognition at all, but if you want to hear an album with radioheads raw guitars and hard and crashing lyrics then this album is for you.  I can compare it with the bends a lot, my favorite radiohead album (only pablo honey is more carefree, and harder).  It's that alternative rock/punky sound sort of, the exact opposite of kid a or ok computer.  i love all of radioheads albums and i sure think this album deserves some credit.  anyone can play guitar will blow you away, as well as thinking about you and prove yourself.<br />p.s anything off this album is good (exception of creep)
B00000K31V|5.0|I live in México City and I really admire the Cronnenberg's work. I was waiting this movie to come theaters in my country but that never ocurred. So, without seen it but trusting in the Cronnenberg's work, I decided to bought this DVD and I must say that is one of the best movie treatments about Virtual Reality. The legend in the potrait is just a &quot;promo&quot; thing, the one about Matrix is just Child's play, but eXistenZ is a most intelligent look about the distorsion of our reallity and the creation of new ones. I really love this theme, but there are just few movies out there that have something very intelligent to say about it. Comes to my head: of course MATRIX, NIRVANA(an itallian by Gabrielle salvatores and with a very different Cristopher Lambert ***Reccomend***), Strange Days and of course eXistenZ. May be I forgot one, or many of them.<br />ABOUT THIS EDITION: Is not bad. I cuts a little in the original aspect ratio but well, nobody's perfect. But, DVD, DVD. New technology. USE IT. Extras, deletes scenes, audio commentary by Cronnenberg, art design, pictures,etc...

B00003CX8I|4.0|Hell, I thought this movie was great!  I saw it the first day it came out and it made me want to be an X-woman myself.  There was great acting in this movie, especially from Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman.  The special effects are jaw-dropping, from the showing of the powers, to the Blackbird, to the battle of mutants in the end.  And best of all, Toad was actually turned into a badass! (if you are a fan of the comics, you know how much of a loser Toad is).  The only things I didn't like on this film were how the story centered more between Wolverine and Rogue, and the rest of the X-Men were more like coat hangers.  And hey why the hell is Sabretooth in a team??  Everyone knows that he doesn't give a crap about the X-Men, he just wants Wolverine!  Oh well.  Great movie noneotherless.  <br />If you want to see more good comic-based films, check out: Blade, the first two Batman films, The Crow, The Mask, Conan the Barbarian, and the R-Rated version of Spawn

B00004Z400|5.0|The deftones have come a long way since adrenaline, and over the years they have surpassed numerous metal bands in almost every way (vocals, drums, bass, lyrics, etc.). Deftones are beyond Korn, Slipknot, Metallica, and RAGE. Chino Moreno's voice is the future for heavy metal/alternative bands.  He can sing, rap,  scream, and make his voice turn all crazy and still make it sound melodic. The drummer (Abe Cunningham) is vital to the band and makes every beat sound intense and filled with aggression and feeling. Chi Cheng's bass skills and Stephen Carpenters's strings are even more so awe-inspiring and add to the overall eminence of the WHITE PONY...and also, DJ Frank Delgado blends in very well with the band.  Even though this band does not get much airplay, it's due to special reasons. The WHITE PONY is simply a masterpiece. Playing it on the radio would ruin its quality, and degrade the overall greatness. It is too damn complex,intricate, and devilishly amazing to be put out on radio. The full effect and affection of this album can be witnessed by just listening it on high quality CD sound.  The WHITE PONY will always be revered as the best metal album of the future. This is one great band and they're way up there with Radiohead. Deftones is all about music and art, and it shows through all of their songs(especially digital bath and korea). No other band can compare to what these guys have accomplished...JUST BUY THE WHITE PONY.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I've been listening to Rammstein since Herzeleid and their musical ability has been growing and growing. This is musically their best so far, the only problem is WHAT they sing about if you understand German.
0446364495|1.0|I could not even finish reading the last 20 pages of this book because of the offensive content.  This book is a glorified romance novel; hiding behind pretentious, contrived, Hemingway-esque descriptive passages:  &quot;With her face buried in his neck and her skin against his, she could smell rivers and woodsmoke, could hear steaming trains chuffing out of winter stations in long-ago nightimes, could see travelers in black robes moving steadily along frozen rivers and through summer meadows, beating their way toward the end of things.  The leopard swept over her again, and again and yet again, like a long prairie wind, and rolling beneath him, she rode on that wind like some temple virgin toward the sweet, compliant fires marking the soft curve of oblivion.&quot;  Drivel!  I have read so many books of this nature lately and it  is increasingly offensive to me that storylines dealing with the romanticism of marital infidelity become best sellers.  It's the same old story of the poor, neglected, lonely mother/housewife who is trapped in a boring marriage to your average hard-working &quot;good-Joe&quot; type husband.  Who could blame this poor woman for giving into temptation when this exciting, good looking, worldly man comes into her life and makes her feel beautiful, intelligent and desirable again?  After 24 hours they are in the sack and after four days of lust, they both know they have finally found their soulmate!  Give me a break!  The final insult is that the reader is supposed to respect her for choosing her family over &quot;true&quot; love, out of guilt and responsibility?  The truly touching love stories are those that are based upon two people who have committed themselves completely to one another, standing together through the good and bad times, the exciting and boring times; raising children and making a life together.  All of these &quot;ordinary&quot; moments combined over a lifetime, create a shared history, a friendship, a partnership, a romance.  Now, that's a love story.a romance.  Now, that's a love story.
B00003CXYW|5.0|I went to see this movie on the Wednesday after its release in 1982. There where about ten people watching it including me, which made me sort of regret going, but the style of the movie gripped me from the first moment. The Batty &quot;shores of Orion&quot; soliloquy at the end is certainly, for my money anyway, one of the best moments in movie history. The scene in which Rachel shows off her photos reminded me a lot of the pathos of the photo scene in &quot;Das Boot&quot; (1981) when the sub is sinking. I returned to see this movie to an even emptier theater which I thought was a real shame. For those who could not experience the movie in a theater, the DVD is the next best thing. This one is a keeper.
B000021Y7X|5.0|This was on of my first Concrt DVD's that I bought and still the best.  The sound quality is great!  Both audio formats sound great.  I use this as my reference for comparisons.  The only downside is it is not DTS.  Ohterwise still on of the best out there.  It even sounds good very loud.  I mean 1500/ channel loud!  Buy it.
0790729342|5.0|This movie is a full on, action packed movie.  Mel Gibson hasn't played another character like this and I don't think he has it left in him now.  The Road Warrior is the best of the Mad Max movies and it's very simple which is what makes it great.  The stunts and action scenes in the movie are amazing.  The last 25 or 30 mintues is just a non stop action scene and when it's all over you have to catch your breath.  If you actually think about it, there are very few words in the movie and George Miller shows you how to make a visual action movie.  This is the problem with most action movies, they attempt to rely on dialogue that isn't that strong to begin with, instead of telling the story with the action.
B000059MEK|5.0|I picked up the cd today and find that it is tottaly new and vibrant. Daft Punk really outdid themselves, Homework was a bit colder, but Discovery is really light and funky. Sucha variety, of dance, 80's and others. Sure its a bit cheesy at times, but ts interesting that if you listen to them all in a sequence its sort of a story....<br />Great sort of 80's and disco and techno mixed together. All the songs are things that you can step to. Definetly pick up this one. Its worth the money.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This soundtrack is totally cool. i luv comin home and just blaring it on my stereo!! i LOVE Lady Marmalade! it is so cool! hearing nicole kidman sing is ineresting but its very good!!
B000002HGD|5.0|Everything Is Wrong which was Moby's 6th CD (counting the EP, Move) is a very important album in his career.  It helped establish the fact that he's a very eclectic artist.  Before Everything Is Wrong, Moby was primarily known as a techno artist, and a pretty good one at that.  However, on this album, he gives the listener a variety of different styles:  ambient, dance/techno, punk rock, and pop.  As a matter of fact, his next album, the infamous Animal Rights would see him concentrate on only 2 types:  punk rock and ambient.  It is IMHO, though, that he's at his best when he does pop/dance/techno and ambient.  Whether people like him or not, they have to admit that he's an incredible musician.  This album with its different styles would definitely foreshadow his 9th and breakthru album, Play.  Here's the best tracks on this CD:<br />1) Hymn -- A great piece to open, it's a very soothing and ambient piece featuring the piano.<br />2) Feeling So Real -- A very infectious dance song that will have you singing the hook all day long.<br />5) Everytime You Touch Me -- Another infectious dance song that is alot like #2.  It, too, has a catchy hook.<br />7) What Love -- A very hard rock song that at times reminds me of a Beck song when Moby sings during the parts that are not fast.  This type of song along with track #3 would dominate his next album, Animal Rights.<br />8) First Cool Hive -- A great ambient and mellow piece, it may be the most recognizable track on this album because it was used in Scream as well as in TV commercials (VH-1 uses in their own ad for their morning mix).  It reminds me alot of something that Enigma would do.<br />10) Anthem -- Another mellow, ambient piece that is a little more frenetic than First Cool Hive.  It has somewhat of a techno feel to it.<br />12) God Moving Over the Face of the Waters -- A 7 minute plus masterpiece of visual music.  One can't help but picture water when hearing this stunning tour de force of music.  One of Moby's all-time greatest tracks.<br />13) When It's Cold I'd Like to Die -- A somewhat eerie song and way to finish the album.  The woman who sings vocals on track #9 also sings the vocals on this one and does a good job.<br />A major music magazine hailed this album calling it one of the 20 most important albums ever.  I won't go that far and say that because I feel Play is a better album and Moby's unquestioned masterpiece.  However, Everything Is Wrong is no chopped liver.  If you enjoyed Play then you will enjoy this album.
0790734850|5.0|Curtis Hanson is a man well versed in the art of film noir.  This film touches on all the criteria that makes film noir.  From the seedy world surrounding the characters to the femme fatale.  In his interviews on the DVD you learn of the specific look, through art direction and cinematography, that he was going for and accomplished.  Everyone in this film plays their characters beautifully.  If you're a fan of the old crime dramas check this one out cause you won't be dissappointed.
B00000273M|4.0|'Walk like an Egyptian' was their track that caught my attention when I first listened of Bangles, and I think it is one of the most original tracks of its genre ever written. On this greatist hits album..you'll find the best works of the band. I particularly recommend listening to 'Manic Monday', 'Eternal flame' and 'I'll set you free'. One of their members voice is strikingly similar to Cyndi Lauper, so fans of C.L should definitely listen to Bangles also. Overall, a worthy 80's album.
B000002JR8|5.0|To start off this review, this is pantera's hardest album to date, all the songs on this album are heavy as hell except for the last one, the black sabbath cover planat caravan, but that song is good too, the best songs on this album are strength beyond strength, becoming, 5 minutes alone, i'm broken, slaughtered, 25 years, throes of rejection and planat caravan, you could easily listen to this album from start to finish without gettin bored, phils vocals are brutal as hell, the bass is really distorted n tuned down on this album, one of the best metal albums ever.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I have been a fan since the age of seven years old.  Stevie has saved my life time and time again...And even though people have had such a hard time with a lot of Stevie's solo work, I must say that if you really listen, it really is the same song, the same story &quot;over and over again...&quot;  <br />Maybe for the first time though, Stevie has been allowed the time and space to let it come out and be produced slowly and well, so that this collection is flowing like no other she has produced.  Trouble In Shangri La, is by far her best collectively new work, but the entire collection of her songs cannot exist without any one of her songs taken away.<br />Rock on Stevie...I will always love you...And I hope people realize she can't stop this thing that she does.  From Rhiannon to Love is...It is all the same song, just &quot;one more chip off an already broken heart...&quot;
0312979479|1.0|This was not a very good book.  It showed how fear and confusion and alot of other emotions effect people.  It is probably one of the worst book I have read and did not enjoy it.  I really don't recommend this book to anyone.  I think that you will waste your time with this book.  It is a mystery that repeats itself, it doesn't keep you interested.  I give it a one.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is definitely in my top 10 album list, and should be on everybody's if they like good music. The music never ceases to amaze me. U2 is the best rock band since the Beatles, because their albums are thoroughly high-quality from start to finish, a very rare achievement. That said, all of the songs have a stunning resonance that only gets better the more you listen to it. &quot;With or Without You&quot; is, in my opinion, U2's best song ever, and the best song of the 1980s.  There is not one song on The Joshua Tree that I do not like.  In fact, all of them are masterpieces, the best being &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,&quot; &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name,&quot; &quot;One Tree Hill,&quot; and &quot;Running To Stand Still.&quot;  The musicianship of U2 is amazing, from Bono's sparkling, near-perfect voice, to Edge's ringing guitar and Adam and Larry's bass and drums.<br />Another reason I love this album is because of the spirituality that shines throughout the album.  U2 have always been able to speak a spirtual language that doesn't sound preachy or evangelical.  Rather, they are searching for an answer, something that many of us can relate to in our own lives.  Much of the 1980's culture was drowning in excessive materialism and narcissism, and U2 was a breath of fresh air in those shallow times.  The 80s work of U2 is some of the very little music from the 80s that doesn't sound dated (I was only 2 when this album was released, but when I bought it this year, I was instantly attached to it).  Simply put, The Joshua Tree is timeless!
B000001Y42|4.0|Well before I got this album, I was expecting a balls out heavy album with no rap influence at all, well it is heavy, at times, and you can deffinatly hear a rap influence in this album, the first time i heard it I thought, alright, an average album, dont hate it but prolly wont listen to it much, but after 3, 4 more listens it has really grown on me, limp bizkits heaviest album deffinatly, and the songs are pretty damn catchy too, so If you dont mind hearin fred try to rap here n there buy this album now!
B0000507R0|4.0|I have a 5.1 receiver with built in decoder and a lower end Sony DVD video player.  The sound of the Disc is fantastic and the seperation is incredible.  A must for ELP fans.  Karn Evil 9 swirls the music around the room. I also liked the addition of Lucky Man as an extra track.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00000JZC4|3.0|When I heard \\"Take a Picture\\" on the radio,I thought it was so Magical and Mellow,and I read this really happened to Richard Patrick.He woke up running around naked on a Airplane.I love the line after the soft sound,with the yealing,\\"HEY DAD,WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR SON NOW.\\"I wanted to hear more of this type of music,but its not in here.This is a Weird,Dark,Hard Rock record.\\"Cancer\\" scares the hell about of me.It could be in a Steven King film,and the first time I heard the ending of \\"The Best Things,\\" I thought for sure my CD player was broke.Its like a bomb going off.I did enjoy Filter's CD for the most part,but the rest of the songs are nothing like the hit single,\\"Take a Picture.\\"
0618001905|4.0|Ignorance of this particular episode in history caused me to procure this book upon reading a review.  And I was not sorry.  In fact, I was shocked that these events were allowed to be lost in history.  The writing is well organized and executed and develops into a swift and picturesque read.  So vivid, in fact, that one is left feeling the need for a thorough cleansing after reading the inhumane acts the \\"civilized\\" world visited upon the Congo.  It's very obvious the author is passionate about telling this story with a veil of judgement surrounding it, the book's only flaw, and I don't see how one could have written around that.  In a way, this book leads your interest to King Leopold, himself, a very complex and enigmatic personality.  This is definitely a good book.
B00003CXN4|5.0|The year 2000 was the year of alot of epic films so to speak. One of them, and that is Traffic, stands out among them all. To say anything other than excellent about traffic would be a big understatement. The cast, including Benicio Del Toro, Michael Dougles, Catharene Zeta-Jones and Don Cheadle are among the best. And as far as acting goes, top-notch, literally. The film is bueatifully directed by Steven Soderbergh. Most people complain about the use of the camera, and the angels and shaking and what not. To be correct, it was an excellent use of movement to show the grittiness of certain situation. As for the story, nothing less than outstanding. The drug war in the united states viewed through 4 different stories... TRAFFIC is a must see, and defiently a must buy on DVD despite the lack of extras.
0451524985|5.0|This novel is not the explicit sex book that you have been led to believe. instead it is a flawless masterpiece that tells the story of Charlotte, the sexually deprived wife of an invalid husband and her search for true love and sexual fulfillment. As a woman, I have no idea how Lawrence was able to delve into the female mind so thoroughly, but so he has done. This book is a compelling argument in favor of the belief that sexual attraction is certainly one of the most important aspects when we search for a mate-despite what snobbish types may say about how looks don't matter and good sex and attraction grows with time. Baloney! Charlotte's attraction to Mellors was immediate and we watch her life developing with breathless anticipation. Some may feel the ending is too cute and tidy, but knowing the characters as they are, you feel that it could not have ended any other way. A profound book, thoroughly readable, and shockingly modern for its time.
0679721037|4.0|The book Hiroshima, by John Hersey, follows the lives of six survivors of the Atomic Bomb, dropped on the city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 at 8:15 AM. The book chronicles the lives of these six survivors up to forty years after the dropping of the bomb. On that day, more then 100,000 Japanese were killed, and these six were fortunate to live through it. The survivors had to continue their lives through their will to survive, overcoming all obstacles such as pain, poverty, disease, famine, and lack of humanity.  The survivors of the bomb had to live the rest of their lives suffering with more then just their physical pain, but also with their social non-acceptance. People would not hire A-bomb victims, or Hibakusha (literally- explosion affected people) because Non-Hibakusha employers developed a prejudice against survivors, and their descendents. The employers were scared that victims would come down with a disease making them unreliable workers. This was the case for survivor Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura. Mrs. Nakamura, weak and poor, began a courageous struggle, which would last for many years, to keep herself and her children alive. She was forced to work many laborious jobs, such as delivering loaves of bread, selling fish, and cleaning houses for her neighbors, and still earned barely enough money to put food on the table. Because of her weakened condition due to radiation exposure, Mrs. Nakamura had to rest for two of three days for every week she worked. Help to her did not come until 1957, thirteen years after the bombing, when the Diet, the congress of Japan, passed the A-bomb Victims Medical Care law, which gave free medical care to survivors.   Other survivors of the Atomic Bomb went through pain, both physically and socially, as a direct result of the explosion. Miss Toshinki Sasaki, at the time of the explosion, was at work talking to a co-worker. The force of the bomb knocked down bookcases, which landed on Miss Sasaki's left leg, crushing it instantly. When rescuers found her, they carried her into a field, under a tin roof, next to two dying people, whose skin was peeling off. Here she sat for two days without any food or water, with terrible pain. Three years before the explosion, Miss Sasaki was engaged to be married, by arrangements through her parents. The couple liked each other, and accepted the arrangements. The two started a life together, but her fianc was drafted into the war. Upon his return, after the bombing, he did not come back to her. His family had had second thoughts on allowing their son to marry a Hibakusha and a cripple. Miss Sasaki eventually gave up hope on finding a husband, and decided to become a nun. Besides continuing difficulties with her leg, she endured liver dysfunction, night sweats and morning fevers, borderline angina, and blood spots. At a banquet celebrating her twenty-fifth anniversary of becoming a nun, Miss Sasaki made a speech. \\"...It is as if I had been given a spare life when I survived the A-bomb. But I prefer not to look back. I shall keep moving forward.\\" Miss Sasaki had a forgiving heart and decided to keep moving foreword with her life. She was going to have the bomb affect her life in the smallest way possible.  The survivors in this novel are great examples on how life goes on, even after the human spirit has endured all types of hardships. Miss Toshinki Sasaki and Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura continued living their lives, making it as best as possible. They overcame pain, poverty, disease and famine also getting through a time of discrimination. This book is definitely worth reading because it shows the human beings willingness to live, even after experiencing ones worst time in life.
B0000041TD|5.0|This is the perfect recording of La Boheme because it captured the best singers in their prime. What is a better combination than Mirella Freni and Luciano Pavarotti?  Even the other singers are tops-Rolando Panerai, Elizabeth Harwood and of course, Nicolai Ghiaurov (Freni's husband). The conducting of Von Karajan never dsipleases. This may not be a DDD recording, but the remastering  is excellent. I would never replace this recording in the world. A must for all operatic libraries!
B000002J03|5.0|In the midst of all Led Zeppelin's classic albums (1-4, Physical Graffiti, Houses of the Holy) II is the absolute masterpiece from one of the greatest rock bands of all time.  The album starts off with the screaming heavy metal of Whole Lotta Love, which is a tremendous way to start off any album it really gets you moving and psyched up.  Next is the passionate what is and what should never be another amazing song that in my opinion is made by Robert Plant's screaming and soulfull voice.  This is followed by the lemon song which is classic Page blues guitar.  Thank You is toned down, slower, and less electric which Zeppelin has also mastered on this album first and later on 3 and Houses of the Holy.  Next is more classic metal from one of the pioneers of the style in Heartbreaker and livin' lovin' maid.  Ramble on is acoustic and awesome.  Moby Dick is one of the most original Zeppelin songs, it is instrumental with a two minute drum solo in the middle of it all from one of the better drummers out there (Bonham).  Bring it on home is a great way to end an album which is slower then the lemon song but has the same bluesy feel to it with a great riff.  All in all this album has the many faces of Led Zeppelin rolled into one incredible album.
B000002P7R|5.0|...South Saturn Delta is a cluttered mess.  Fortunately, just like cleaning out an attic, while listening to this, you are going to find many things you loved that you could never figure out where you placed them.  Thats the best analogy that I can give in regards to this record.<br />Indeed, it is cluttered, and at points even difficult to stomach, but in the end when you look at the album as a whole, you see something more than the mess, something that you just can't resist.  At least it's that way for me and other Jimi-philes alike.  <br />The intent of South Saturn Delta was to find a place for some of Jimi's uncomplete work, some stuff previously unavailable after Cry Of Love, Rainbow Bridge, and War Heroes were deleted from Hendrix catalogues, and other material that even the &quot;hardcore&quot; fans haven't heard.  While most of the material from the previously mentioned out-of-print titles was spread out over the length of &quot;First Rays Of The New Rising Sun,&quot;  some couldn't be placed there, whether it be through time constraints, or the fact that some of the stuff just wasn't complete.  Instead, all of the unfinished material was pushed over to SSD.<br />Despite it's somewhat iffy sound quality, and half-finsihed tracks, SSD still manages to be an incredibly endearing title.  Maybe it's the honestness found in the fact that Jimi wasn't perfect and he did make mistakes, or maybe it's some of the new ideas he was attempting to blend into his lyricism, I don't know.  Much more spiritual, emotional, and poetic work is found throughout.  <br />Even the instrumental tracks (whether they were intended to be instrumentals or Jimi had yet to add vocals) have a fantastic feel, and this is where Jimi shines.  Without constraints in front of the mic, he was free to let loose and just whail on the Strat, visible in many of the &quot;jam-oriented&quot; tracks throughout.  <br />I still do have to wonder why EH/MCA chose to release many of the tracks found here when there is an entire vault of near-complete work and live recordings waiting.  Angel is missing the first two minutes do to damage done to the original master tape (yet, interestingly enough, on the Jimi Hendrix box set, the same track is found, but in complete form).  Sometimes conversation can be heard, and during several tracks, Jimi himself laughs, talking to friends and to the engineer (presumably Eddie Kramer).  <br />But even when you take this into account, SSD is still a fantastic release, and something that dedicated Jimi-freaks have been waiting for for years.  It was preceded by near thirty years of dissapointing rip-offs, and maybe because of this, fans see SSD as being better than it actually may be.  <br />If you want to find out about Jimi, and haven't really heard any of his music, I'd advise you not to invest in this set, as his  complete works are a much better representation of himself.<br />Finished or not though, South Saturn Delta is an excellent, enjoyable release, and one that is sure to please even the most hardcore fans.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I was very pleased to hear that Stevie was releasing her first solo album in 7 years. I was even more pleased when It came out and I had a chance to hear it. This album is so much better than her 1994 release Street Angel. She has even said herself that she is in a different place than she was back then, she is so much happier and it shows through this album. Another reason why this album is so good is because Sheryl Crow co-produces some songs and adds backup on a few also. Sheryl (in my opinion) is one of the only real rock artists to emerge in the 90's. She is also a big fan of Stevie's, so you know she can be influential on how Stevie should sound. Some of my favorites on this cd are the title track, Trouble in Shangri-La and Every Day. Too Far From Texas is also nice, it's a duet with the Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines. Another nice one is Bombay Sapphires with Macy Gray providing backup. Sarah McLachlan provides backup on Love Is. But even with all those people helping her out, it's Stevie who is the main focus here. This cd proves that she's here to stay for a long time. There may even be a new Fleetwood Mac album in the future (crossing fingers).
B00003CXIP|5.0|I was nine years old the first time I saw this movie.  It had a major impact on me, even then.  I was a bit young to comprehend everything, but in eleven years,  I think it's safe to say that I pretty much understand the whole thing.  Stephen King has a knack for writing great, memorable characters and profanely funny dialogue.  Anyone who has ever read &quot;The Body&quot; can tell you that this movie could not have been done better.  The story, while good, is mostly irrelevant.  This one is mostly a character study, and a very entertaining one at that.  The tone and mood are absolutely perfect. The music and score are also a force to be reckoned with.  All in all, I would have to say that this is my 2nd favorite movie of all time.  <br />I first bought this on video about a decade ago.  Over the years,  I guess I have owned maybe three video copies of this and I figured I should probably own the DVD by now.  I am so glad that I waited for this Special Edition.  There is a great commentary, the music video, trailers, and a Featurette with most of the cast, Stephen King, and Rob Reiner.  It was really great to see the cast all together again (with the exception of River Phoenix) and just how much everyone has changed in fifteen years.  I whole-heartedly reccommend this to any fan of the movie.  It is one of the best Dvd's I have ever bought.
B00000BKDV|5.0|This album features the first time newcoming drummer Nicko McBrain joined (he replaced Clive Burr).  The songs are awesome in this one, but it is McBrain that shines the most.<br />Listen to &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; and you KNOW what I mean.  He outdoes himself with his fast-paced drumwork which accompanies Bruce Dickinson's vocals quite well.<br />&quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; is also a very classic song.<br />My favorite song, however, is &quot;The Trooper.&quot;  This fast-paced war song is very exciting and leaves you with a sense of sadness at the end (&quot;without a tear, I draw my parting groan&quot;).  It also features some great guitar work by Adrian Smith and Dave Murray.<br />This is a MUST for any Maiden fan.  Fans will get a kick out of Nicko's awesome drumwork, Adrian and Dave's riveting guitars, and (of course) Bruce's vocal talents.
0060273224|3.0|Sabriel, the daughter of a powerful magician, lives on the mundane side of the wall--in a school that could have been in England in the last century.  When her father's duties call her to the wild and magical land, she finds herself under magical attack--and with awsome responsibility.<br />While fascinating, the world had several discontinuities, and Sabriel's peril and exhaustion appeared artificially severe.  The narrative style didn't lend itself to smooth reading--despite the tense plot.<br />One hopes that Nix's next novel is more polished.
B00000BKDY|5.0|Now, over the years, it has been debated what is the best Maiden album. While most people might pick \\"Number of the Beast\\", \\"Powerslave,\\" or \\"Virtual IX\\", I pick \\"Somewhere in Time\\" as my personal favorite. While I enjoy \\"Powerslave\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" immensely, this particular review states that \\"Somewhere...\\" is the ultimate Maiden.<br />Reasons being is that a few of these songs happen to be my all-time favorites of all time.<br />\\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\" is a great song and this pulls out lots of electronic goodies.  Bruce Dickinson is great!<br />\\"Deja Vu\\" is one of the hardcore guitar songs. Although featuring few vocals, this song goes ALL-OUT on the guitars. I especially liked the fast-paced guitar work and you can tell that Adrian Smith enjoyed this one to the fullest.<br />\\"Alexander the Great\\" is an awesome song, if a bit overlong (especially the tiring 3-minute instrumental somewhere in the middle). My favorite part is the opening \\"march\\" after Alexander's father says his death words. Also, this is one of the historical rock songs, and it deserves high points.<br />\\"Strangers in a Strange Land\\" has a darker feel than the rest of the songs, and it has a couple synthesized goodies here and there.<br />And... quite possibly my all-time favorite song is \\"Wasted Years.\\" This is classic Maiden! A great song that is just perfect; it's not overlong and the instrumentals inbetween the lyrics are not overbearing or dull (like some other Maiden songs over the years). I love the chorus especially.<br />The neat thing about this album is that (like Nicko McBrain with the \\"Piece of Mind\\" album) Adrian Smith is the real highlight of this album. The songs he wrote on this are nothing lower than awesome. Here it is guys... an absolute MUST HAVE for any Maiden fan.
6305751706|4.0|Ken Russell is a film genius! Give paise unto him and behold the flight of fancy that is this truely unique and morbid film experience! A parade of fine acting highlights Russell's decadence and visual wonders to weave a tale of a group of fledgeling writers as they proceed to get trashed on liquid opium and have the night of their lives! Drinking the amber fluid, telling ghost stories and engaging in acts of sexuality with each other (where there is no such thing as gay or straight, but a fine mix of both) and chasing each other around a haunted mansion during a horrid thunderstorm. Their fears call into flesh a demon and it's up to them to take back the life they have given it. Utterly fascinating!
B000023VR6|5.0|This CD couldn't get any better! The best songs are 3, 5, 10, and 11. Number 21 is the best out all though. I recommend this CD to everyone!
0385334206|5.0|I purchased this novel after finishing Cat's Cradle, another Vonnegut novel. Cat's Cradle was the most enlightening and thought provoking thing I've ever experienced, and somehow Breakfast of Champions has topped it. This has been the most amazing piece of literature I've come across, breaking all the rules of &quot;clear thoughts, obvious direction, and plot&quot;. This book has none of these unless you want to think it does, and is basically random thoughts from Vonnegut's head. If you've ever wanted to know what it was like to crawl in someone else's brain, this is the book for you. Discursive but not in a rambling manner, Vonnegut hits a homerun with Breakfast Of Champions.
B00001OH1S|4.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, both the old &amp; new versions. I eagerly anticipated the Brosnan-Russo , 90's edition of this classic, and was not disappointed. However some of the best parts of this wonderful sound track are mysteriously absent, as seems to so often be the case when purchasing &quot;authorized editions&quot; of movie sound tracks. In particular, there is an outstanding rendition of 'The Windmills of Your Mind&quot; performed by Chico O'Farrill &amp; Orchestra that should surely have been included, as well as the steamy/feverish latin dance music performed by the Cumenco All-Stars for the dance scene at the black &amp; white ball.This is a good sound track,but should have been better.
B000002U82|5.0|I can't think of anything bad, or original, to say about this collection of musical genius, so let's say this review is for the opera fan that doesn't like Rock and Roll.  The music can be serene, can be jarring, the vocals show range and depth of emotion, and the story, while sometimes hard to follow (..and tell you understood what was going on in La Boheim) is still impactful with lyrics which are nonetheless profound and meaningful.  The song &quot;Time&quot; still moves me every time I hear the words &quot;..no one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun..&quot;.  Ouch.  I am always motivated to get up off the couch and go out and accomplish something when I hear those lyrics. This is a wonderful CD, and it has to be the music bargain of the century.  If you buy this CD on my recommendation and do not enjoy it, or feel you didn't get your money's worth, let me know.  We will then have to check you for a pulse.
6302968143|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this cute Disney movie, as the Divine Miss M. as the wickedly funny Winnie Sanderson, the witch sister of two other witch sisters, Mary and Sarah (Kathy Najimy and &quot;Sex In The City&quot;'s Sarah Jessica Parker) are resurrected by naive teen (Omri Katz) and his cute little sister (Thora Birch) trying to impress a pretty girl (Vinessa Shaw) who lights a black flame. A little bit of belly laughs, but mostly chuckles. But what makes up for the humor is the hilarious hijinks that ensue when the sisters are resurrected-looking for young children to suck their youth from, so they can live forever. This cute Disney movie has sufficient humor. It also has a little romance, a teeny bit of horror, and genuine warmth are cleverly interwoven in this 93-minute movie. A obvious Halloween favorite. (Don't miss that musical interlude, where the Divine Ms. M sings the funny &quot;I Put A Spell On You.&quot; It obviously does put a little spell on you.) You can also see it on HBO and Cinemax. Rated PG for mild language and some scary stuff.
B00005B1EX|2.0|What I really dislike about this CD is the lack of feel for a live recording.  There are no transitions between songs that places you at the concert.  It is simply a set of recordings from several concerts put on two CDs.  That's the best news.  Most of the CD sounds overdubbed and [unoriginal].  Listen to the crowd - clearly there are additional dubbs of crowd noise that goes from very loud to almost silent in a fraction of a second.  Listen to Robs voice - sounds like, at many times, layers of vocals were added. <br />The net result is an average collection of greatest hits almost live.  I much prefer the Live Meltdown CD because it sounds live with lots of crowd excitement.  This is how a live CD should sound.<br />One last note - where are \\"The Ripper\\" or \\"Green Manalishi\\" or \\"Diamonds and Rust\\"?  Leaving these songs of the list and including songs like \\"Cyberworld\\"[?]...

B00003CXRP|5.0|In seeing Castaway on the big screen, my original synopsis of the movie was that it was an incredible journey into the mind of a brilliant director.  The infinite struggles, and challenges that would be faced have been shown in ugly true color in this movie.   The actor, Tom Hanks, and his friend Wilson (A volleyball), show a very exhuberant and live action film. Would recommend to anyone.
B000001FRY|5.0|I bought BOY about a month ago and am still stunned by just how good this albulm really is. In fact, listening back to War and the Joshua Tree, I conclude that they never topped their debut in terms of consistency in excellence. The Joshua Tree got a little too bluesy and produced at times and some of War's funk workouts sound a little silly now. But this is pure guitar/bass/drums. &quot;Out of Control&quot;, &quot;Electric Co.&quot; and &quot;I Will Follow&quot; show the influence of punk(not Poison as some reviewer said!) and work wonderfully, and the other tracks have that wonderful post-punk feel without losing the optimism and getting too depressing. It's brevity also works for it, and is great from start to finish. Perhaps the best rock album of the 80s.
6301885732|2.0|I never saw this in the theaters, so I saw it finally on tape.<br />What a let down! with such a stellar cast, you would expect a better performance, and from such a big budget, you would expect a better script.  In fact, this film had nothing in common with the comics I read so long ago.  Dick Tracy seems to be a heavy handed thug-cop, who, admittedly gets the job done, but but is such a sledgehammer in the process that he is un-likeable.<br />Moreover, I think the masterminds behind this move were betting on the franchise name, like with Batman, it's super-hype predecessor.  What we got was a film that looked like Dick Tracy, but tasted very different!<br />I though Tess Trueheart was his love interest, but judging from the osculation with Madonna, I am in doubt.  Yes, he did give Tess a ring, but he was lip-locked with a third woman, on several occasions. I hope this troilism was not a Freudian Slip on anyones part!<br />The story line seemed to be a rehash of several standard Hollywood gimmicks:  the plain jane dame next door v. the super-model super-tramp, Madonna's annoying O'Guffans (See Ebert's Little Movie Glossary), and the very flat villains.  There were too many of them.  Batman just paired it down to one villain, which made it easier to follow.]<br />And that twist at the end was twisted and unbelievable!  Belch!<br />THE GOOD:  This film does have some redeeming qualities. First, I like the style: the choice for colors and the comic book feel comes across well.  Second, the cinematography is superb.  We need more Fritz Langs!  Third, the the non-Madonna music added to the 1940's feel to it. It it was nice to see a 1940'-style film that did not involve Nazi's or Hirohito!<br />Overall, if you have an hour or so to kill, or if lost a bet, see this movie.
0440234743|4.0|I found this to be a very profound story of redemtion.  I really like how this story evolved.  It was interesting how Troy and Nate were similar; except, Troy new how to save money and Nate didn't.  I felt sorry for the Phalen heirs, because they were doomed from birth.  I even had some sympathy for Troy; simply for the fact, with all his wealth he was still lonely and angry.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|...but first: are you experienced? If you arent, this is a great start to being experienced. And if you are, then you know what this is all about: the greatest musician thats ever walked on this planet! This is a collection of the BEST songs Jimi ever made, including for example Foxy Lady, All Along the Watchtower, Little Wing and If 6 Was 9. I would add some other songs to the CD, but I wouldnt take anything away from it.  Jimi Hendrix was a genius, no doubt. He developed rock music and especially guitar playing with wah-wah and feedback. This CD is a great cross-section of his career and his life, the life that was too short. He lived fast and died young, too young. But what he left behind was something that we others couldnt do even though we lived hundred years old.
B000056K04|2.0|With &quot;Everyday&quot;, I just don't know what to think about Dave Matthews Band anymore.  Part of me wants to take this album, throw it out the car window, and never think about it again.  But another part of me is a huge fan of DMB.  That part wants to give this album a fair chance, and accept the change on Everyday.  And in the end...<br />Everyday lost.  Everyday is no Under the Table and Dreaming.  There is no &quot;#41&quot; or &quot;Seek Up&quot; on Everyday.  Not even close. Everyday is an empty album to put it best.  The Band truly put no effort at all behind this one.  No emotional tugs on this one, no deep lyrics, no violin or saxphone to ease the mind.  None of that.  I don't know what happened.  I am in no position to critize the band, but I will anyways.  The album is completely worthless.  So much so, I really have lost interest in catching the band on tour this summer.  But you know what, whatever.  It's not something to lose sleep over.  They just produced a meaningless, heartless album, and nothing to good can ever come out of that.  And as for the Lillywhite Sessions, yeah, they're good.  How good you ask?  Well, put it this way, they have some heart in them.
0805062971|5.0|The first rule of fight club is do not talk about fight club.  The Second rule of Fight Club is DO NOT TALK about fight club. An amazing first novel by an author that will be around for awhile. To say the least life changing, it dables in buddism thoughts and giving up all worldly possesions. This book speaks the truth about modern day life and has the dark humor that life now aday offers.  If you read but one book in your life time, read fight club
B00003CXN4|4.0|This movie has a good message for society: Many people really don't see how bad the drug war is in America and all around the world. It's so easy for teenagers and even younger kids to get drugs these days, and this movie shows it in all it's disturbing detail. Micheal Douglas, Catherine Zeta Jones, and the rest of the cast all give superb performances in this mesmerizing film. It runs a bit too long, but all in all, it is a wonderful film. Benecio Del Toro took home the Best Supporting Oscar for this one this year. His performance was also great.
B00000I8BX|4.0|im sorry i misspelled a bunch of stuff in my review i was drunk or tired or something, and i meant to put this is the first death metal band that i have listend to
B00003CXP1|5.0|This film is wonderful...its almost unbearable to watch Sweet old Ellen Burstyn become an abomination of drugs... or Jennifer Connely change from an aspiring dreamer to a dark trashy whore... just to feed her addiction. Or Jared Leto changing from loving son to barely even human. You just want to jump into the sceen and smack Ellen and Jennifer (especially) around until they come to their senses. Needless to say this is not a happy ending... in fact the director slaps the reality of them losing ALL of their hopes and dreams FOREVER right into your face with no remorse. They're gone and they can NEVER get them back. Seeing Ellen's friends crying on the bench makes us cry too... seeing jennifer cry in her bed where even there the nightmare's torment her. Bottom line is... Reqiuem for a dream is a wonderfully crafted, acted, directed film. There ARE no flaws. Everyone should see this at least once... to throw it into a drug users face would be the great pleasure whether its to say &quot;look how stupid you are?&quot; or just to demonstrate what happens. This isn't a film about Drugs... its a film about losing all you hopes, dreams, family, friends, lovers, homes, and you life. And your never getting it back. These people had a chance, but they lost it. This is their story.
B00003CXPD|5.0|this is one awesome movie.  i was moved to tears more than once. jamie bell is pure talent.  hope to see more of him in the future.  i am on my third disk and quality control (...).  i am going to have to return this one.  at several points on the dvd it simply stops, pauses for a few seconds, starts again.  sometimes it reverts to an earlier scene.  i have yet to watch the entire movie from start to finish.
078062582X|5.0|This movie was really bad, i dint care for it at all, i didnt like anybody in the movie except Demi, she is so sexy, the unrated version was terrific, she has a wonderful body, super sexy, thats all this show is worth though, so enjoy it, just to see her dance, everytime the nude shots appear put it in slowmo it rocks trust me, well hope u enjoyed!!
B00003CXPD|5.0|If anything proves the irrelevance of the MPAA's rating system, this movie is it; it should've had no more than a PG-13.<br />Wonderful movie. Jamie Bell and Julie Walters were terrific. Then ending was a let-down; the 14 year flash-forward seemed tacked on and pointless.
B00000JGEO|5.0|A true masterpiece, great performance by Arnold as usual, Tom Arnold very funny as well as Bill Paxton. Great suspense, action, humor, acting in general. Arnold and Jaimee Lee Curtis make a terrfic pair in this film together, quite exciting and fun. If you love smooth paced, action, suspense films, dont miss this one.
B000000WA2|2.0|First, let me say I am a huge Blur fan.  And I knew exactly what I was paying for when I got this-the exact opposite of what got me into them, Blur and 13.  This is made for Britain: string and horn arrangements, and the so-called punkish Globe Alone (while not such a bad song), can't be compared to anything in the way Green Day or Bad Religion or whatever your idea of punk is.  So, for U.S. Blur fans in it for their rock, don't bother unless you're a big fan.
B000007PI9|1.0|This movie is the worst movie ever made! I hated it. I had to watch it in school last year, and I laughed at it the whole time. I did , however learn one thing from it: if you are ever being pursued by crazy axe wielding maniacs, it is safe to be in the car with Stalone. You will not be injured even if the car flips over 17 times. Oh yeah, and 1 person can take on an army, because they always wait to strike....
6301871952|1.0|I can't beleive you people like Gremlins 2 it's dumb. This time they are in New York City and they all hatch during the day but not night. It's good to see everyone back but what happened to Billy's parents? The only thing good about this movie is the big spider near the ending. The first Gremlins is the best stick with that one. This sequel is just lame.
B000001DTM|5.0|Probably the best album ever made. The exceptional description of Bono and his boys of every posible face of love...is, in lyrics and music, a sublime experience that goes directly to the heart.
B000059MEK|5.0|The French duo follow up their highly acclaimed debut album 'Homework' with a modern classic.  Breaking away from the addictive yet slightly limited hard-house genre as heard in 'Homework', Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem Christo display their originality and inventive genius on 'Discovery'.  This album mixes almost all types of music. From contrepuntal baroque melodies to extreme 80s funk, from Jamiroquai-esque grooves to space-age sounds, 'Discovery' encompasses all.  Dance floors all over the world were rocked by the slightly 'poppy' yet extremely catchy 'One More Time', but people expecting an album full of similar tunes will be surprised.  The second single 'Aerodynamic' is rather less mainstream, but to appreciators of music resembles something that the music industry has been missing for a long time - something which is not afraid to cross barriers. 'Discovery' takes the listener on a journey full of 'Yes' style guitar solos, music-by-layers, hardcore vocals (Romanthony - what energy!), house influence and not forgetting Daft Punk's natural funk.  This album is indespensable and if it's not already in your CD collection - GO AND BUY IT!!! Standout tracks: Aerodynamic, Harder Better Faster Stronger,                     Superheroes, Veridis Quo.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This DVD just plain rocks.It ranks up there with the Matrix and the X-Men in being the best DVD ever made.What is surprising about this movie is that it looks and sounds SOOO good after being made 23 years ago!! Watching this DVD for the first time you would think that the movie was made recently,it really is that high in quality.You should get this movie just for the awesome surround sound.I just can't say enough about this DVD.Buy it just to see the MANY actresses who tried out for Lois Lane alone.There are WAY too many extras to list them all,I'll just say that you have to flip the disc over there are that many.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Its true Em may have some explicit lyrics, but all in all its only how the guy feels. His rhymes are great and filled with some humor that you mght be a certain age to get. But it also has a clean version for you over protective prents.Even though he has a bad rap the guy is artist whose sold millions so don't protest someone who makes more money than you.Yes I may be 13, but my mother trusts me not to take it literally and neither should anyone else. If you don't believe me then don't buy it, but if you do please don't try anything of it at home or  deeply believe what he says.
B000002KC5|5.0|This is the best early Randy Newman album, and  is second overall only to \\"Land of Dreams.\\"  Like that work, \\"Good Old Boys\\" explores Newman's ambivalent love/hate relationship with the American South, and the poor white [people] who muddle along there. \\"Land of Dreams\\" contains the autobiographical explaination for his fascination, but this album covers more ground, and presents more bizarre characters.<br />Reviewers commonly explain Newman's ostensibly offensive songs, songs like \\"Rednecks\\" or \\"Kingfish\\" on this album, as being satirical.  It's not quite that simple.  The  vicious racist characters in Newman's songs often make some valid point (\\"Free to be put in a cage in Harlem\\") or are as mistreated themselves as they treat other  (\\"Isn't it a shame what the river has done to this poor cracker's land?\\")...<br />If I could give this album 6 stars, I would.
B00004T1NA|2.0|Porcupine Tree's preceding effort, Stupid Dream, had it's flaws but was far superior to this aimless effort.  Wilson has his talents but needs to pay some serious attention to improving his guitar work. He would also be well advised to wait until he has something to say before stepping into the studio. This is really an uninspired mess.  Even the band's understated but creative sense of rhythm on Stupid Dream is absent here.  You'd be much better off turning to the Flower Kings...Simon
0696204800|5.0|I had no idea that this was a book of 4&quot; blocks when I ordered it.  It is exactly what I needed since I am focusing on smaller quilts. Has full size blocks that can be traced for foundation piecing.  Some great ideas for projects.  I highly recommend it for all quilters but especially for the quilters who like smaller projects. It is truly a &quot;treasury&quot; and belongs in your library.
B0000584V3|5.0|Simple put stop complaining dudes! This is  one really excellent cd just because the band did not do other my arms! is that in it self a  bad thing? HELL NO!!!!
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie Nicks has always had a way with verse and creating hooks in her music.  That is the most valuable part of writing a song.  Some people have began to equate great songwriting with preaching, or trying to see how many expletives someone can put into a song.  Music is supposed to be enjoyable.  This album is the most enjoyable one I have purchased in a very long time.<br />The collaborators that Stevie chose to work with ont his album is quite a diverse group.  One of the Dixie Chicks, Macy Gray, Sarah Maclaughlin, and Sherly Crow.  Each bring something new to the table, and add a richness to the sound of the music.<br />Songs like &quot;Candlebright&quot; and &quot;Love is&quot; will grab you and linger in your head.  &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; is a rocker that will make you want to move.  And the introspective &quot;Every day&quot; will lighten your day.  I just hope it doesn't have to be as long for the next album as it did for this one.
6302453356|4.0|This is one of the most touching movies I've see so far. And I never cry when I watch movies! This movie made me cry and laugh. It was heartbreaking when Peter Pan forgot who he was and it was touching when he started to rememeber everything. The first time I saw Wendy I abosutly bawled my eyes out! The movie however is funny like when he first meets Tinkerbell &quot;Firefly from Hell!!&quot; and when he was learning to fly again &quot;Oh I know I happy thought! Not being in this thing is a happy thought&quot; All though this movie has a little bit of swearing and violence it's still a family movie. And I would watch it again.
B00004ZB9D|2.0|Listening to Lennys latest album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; I realize his music does not hold up over the years.<br />His latest single &quot;Again&quot; is good, but it is just average pop that eventually wheres thin on the pop music brain.  They have played it to death on radio, and it became one of his biggest hits...why?  When you have &quot;Black Velveteen&quot;?<br />Other songs that did not make it on here from his album &quot;5&quot; are better than his renditions of the tired &quot;American Woman&quot;, and his Top 20 hit &quot;Fly Away&quot; is good, but again tires too.<br />Only one standout song on this compilation lives up to any classic rock abiltiy and that is &quot;It Ain't Over Till Its Over&quot; which has a Marvin Gaye/Al Green quality written all over it.<br />Otherwise this CD is pretty much a bore.
6303617719|5.0|For anyone who can appreciate romance, fun, and the beauty of French culture, this is the film for you. Meg Ryan is adorable, as usual, and Kevin Kline does an impeccable job as a rough Frenchman, nearly stumping even my French family with his accent! Everything about this film is charming, and it will have you laughing 'til your stomach hurts and falling in love with it all over again every time you watch it. I have seen it more times than I could ever remember, and I love it more each time. Truly perfect for both men and women. You've gotta see it!
B000056NX4|2.0|As JCS is one of my favourite shows, I purchased this new production sight unseen.  I got that familiar chill as the overture started and as the opening riff to Heaven On Their Minds started, I was ready to burst.  Then Jerome Pradon opened his mouth and I knew I had wasted my money.  It was all down hill from their.  Pradon was a joke.  I've heard cats copulate with more harmony.  Even worse was Glenn Carter.  A weak, hollow voice with dreadful falsetto.  In the featurette he talks of how demanding the vocals are.  What they demanded he didn't deliver.  The look was great and the music, as always was spot on, but this is a rock piece.  Anyone who has heard Gillan, Neeley, Farnham or even Balsamo in the role should be committed for thinking Carter came even close.  The local amateur society took JCS on last month and were better than this.  And what's all this about people saying they are glad to see Could We Start Again was included? It has been part of the show since it opened on Broadway in'71 and included on 80% of the recordings to date.  Do yourselves a favour and avoid this like the plague.  The 1973 film with Neeley, Anderson and Elliman exposes this as the rubbish that it is.  Or are my standards too high after seeing the '92 Australian production four times, the same production that Tim Rice says in his autobiography was the best ever??
B000059ZLH|5.0|Man, Dream Theater kicks some arse once more!  This DVD is great.  I'm a DT fan, and i have never seen them live.  This DVD captures the energy and funness (if funness is a word!) of a DT concert.  The music is great, could have better sound quality though.  This is a must be for any DT fan.  I recomend the DVD.  You get so so so much more.  Like when you can have the band themselfs watching the concert with you.  It's friggin funny!  Anycrap, YOU MUST BUY THIS DVD!!!
B000000993|4.0|i'd recommend this album for any Tool fan.  If you just want a classic record then go with Aenima and skip this one for right now, but come back to it if you are interested in the progression of the band.
B00003CXAE|5.0|When Grease was released, I was only 14. I remember waiting in a line that went around the entire city block. I had to buy my ticket two days in advance just to see the movie everyone was talking about. The songs were great and the movie seemed as if it were written for the two stars. Travolta never looked better and Olivia was truly America's #1 hottie. I'd never heard so much whistling, shouts and moans as I did when the movies climax had Olivia come out in that black outfit. Everyones mouth dropped open, including mine. Like myself, people left the theatre singing and dancing and they're still doing it today. The re-release of the movie 20 years later into theatres shot to number 2, just behind the mega hit Titanic. This proves it's a timeless hit.

B00000K19E|5.0|One of my favorite films, The Matrix has a complex in-depth story, excellent visuals and cool action. Neo thinks he's living in the &quot;real world&quot; when two people by the name of Morpheus and Trinity finds him and proves that an artificial intelligence called &quot;The Matrix&quot; is controlling the &quot;real world&quot; and that it must be destroyed. The cyber rebels combat against police officers, SWAT teams and professional agents who have the ability to morph that guard and are loyal to The Matrix. By using martial arts and knowledge from computers that process knowledge into their minds and special powers, these cyber rebels fight for real freedom from The Matrix. The visuals such as the kung fu scene between Morpheus and Neo, and the fight bewteen Neo and Agent Smith are incredible. The action such as the scene where Neo and Trinity combat against SWAT teams are also cool but do not see this movie if you are infulenced by violence because some people blame this movie for school shootings. As a hard working teen, athlete and a one-time honor student, I am not really influenced by this movie. I just enjoy it and state my review right here.
0385335482|5.0|I know people like Rebecca, the main character who are definite shopaholics.  I identified with Bex' ability to talk herself into purchasing things (i.e., I did so well budgeting today that I should treat myself for it with this nice pair of boots). I have been there myself I am sorry to say. This book was hillarious, and had a few unexpected turns which really made it an astonshing read.  <br />If you're looking for a fun read, this is it.
B000002HAF|5.0|buy this cd.  listen to the songs over and over, repeatedly, until you know every word, every note, every moment.  you'll be glad you did.
0060278234|4.0|While this book begins a story and leaves it hanging, it is the real thing.  There are very few books that create a compelling alternate reality, although many authors try.  Garth Nix' characters seem real, and the magic also seems real.  Not quite enough is revealed about the way the magic works, or the history behind it - the way Tolkein never said much in LOTR about the other rings, or other wizards.  Nix gives you an inkling, but not an understanding.  In Lirael there is less time spent in death than in Sabriel. If you read Lirael, you will wait impatiently for the next volume.

B000050IMG|2.0|Ironically, Scary Movie was trying to make fun of movie cliches, but this movie ended up becoming cliched, too. By this I mean that many of the jokes had already been made, and they were quite predictable. (How many times had I already seen The Matrix ripped off before this?)<br />Another problem was that the new jokes in the film were way too forced. This means that while many of them had the potential to be very funny, they were killed by being set up poorly or being extremely overdone.<br />Furthermore, an obvious goal of this movie was to amuse by being offensive, which can work very well in some movies (Mel Brooks films, Kentucky Fried Movie, Monty Python films), but attempts to offend got in the way of the humor; often this movie feels more mean-spirited than funny. <br />I will admit that I laughed on occasion (which is why I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1), but there are many better spoof-movies than this -- Airplane, Spaceballs, Naked Gun movies, any Monty Python movie -- to which Scary Movie pales in comparison.
B00005214X|4.0|This collection is possibly one of the most important post 1969 examples of what actually was the sound and feeling that represents the best of that incredible musical experience, The Beatles.  Almost as if after John and Paul ran out of the compulsion to stop pounding out self absorbing recordings, George (the quiet one) steps into the studio and captures the mature musical essence and sound that had made the music world stop and pay full attention the the band in the first place.<br />Mr. Harrison had simply grown bored with what his band was presenting during the Sixties and was spending more time with the instrumental giants of the time and this collection shows the fruits of those labours.  These tunes provide witness to how much George Harrison truly contributed to the overall sound of The Fab Four and within the seductive melodies, lay some of the best instrumental studio performances of the period all presented in the quiet, layed back style that is George Harrison.  The only mystery is why it has taken so long to bring this jewel back?

6303407188|5.0|I know I will have all eyes up for me to say it's a love story (?) But I have no better way to title this movie. I guess if you look at the life and times of Ed Wood, you'd agree. The fact that he was himself and true to himself. The fact that he gave and stood by his friend. The fact that he did not care about the world but what he thought he was. He stood by the truth. The fact that he was true to his wife who left him. The fact that he did not hide for what he thought would hurt his second wife (to be). He stood for what he was. Which is why he is what Tim Burton knew and understood. I call it an orphan of a movie - Reasons, another under rated movie. With such beautiful script, acting &amp; directing how can it be over looked. Does one have to be an actor to understand and give it two thumbs up? Disagree! I have been fortunate enough to find this movie to own. Have I been the lucky one, you bet! For starters call it a comedy with a heart of emotion which still does not justify the movie...
0785787135|5.0|While most modern retellings of Arthurian legend focus on the better known aspects of the tale (ie: the battles or the later search for the holy grail), Marian Zimmer Bradley had done something very different, she had created motivation behind the traditional characters that we know and love so well. And anybody that reads extended amounts of fictions will realize, motivation is often times the most important aspect of any given story!<br />The characters in &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; are in no way the cardboard half-lives that too often happen when somebody is trying to retell a myth as complicated as Arthurs, but the characters that personally interest me the most are those of Lancelot, Arthus's bestfriend and the man who eventually steals his wife away from him, and Morgaine, Arthur's &quot;evil&quot; sister that is always plotting his downfall.  For the woman who have always said, this does seem right, Morgan le Fay is evil without reason, this is the story for you; for those of you that have always wondered why a man that obviously loves Arthur as much as Lancelot does could steal his wife, you will also finally get your answers.  At times Marion Zimmer Bradley's characters are so mulit-dimensional that they are too good to be true; in fact they are REAL!  As human beings, nobody is all good or all evil, and this is the thing that has been captured the best in the novel.<br />All in all, a must read, number one on a very long list for me. And this book only gets better the more times that you read it, I have read it at least ten times and each time I walk away from the reading with a completely different message...there is that much to look for and understand within the novel.  In a way it is a mirror, reflected the infinite aspects of human experience: love, hatred, envy, revenge, peace, war, religion, atheism...it is all there, if you wish to see it.
0792151712|1.0|\\"And the Oscar for best actor/actress goes to 'Titanic the Ship.' The rest  got the Golden Raspberry Award, respectively...\\" The fact that I give it a one star is if Cameron could have made this a documantary it would have done justice! I hate fiction and facts mixed together. But here it is used in a tragic historical fact. The very idea is sickening. Well, the wrong ones made the money and we fell for it. Thanx to Hollywood who also fell for it. And to me the best they ever did was putting Ben-hur up there. But now they killed it all. I never believe in awards anywheres, cause the best is always forgotten. But I had given credit to Hollywood, not now. How does this sound - saw the movie &quot;Life is beautiful&quot; when it was released here. We were only 8 of us in the theater! The moment Hollywood / press pumped it up - we all think it's the best. Cameron please stick to reality - you did good with your Terminators &amp; Aliens...
0375704027|4.0|I wanted to enjoy Norweigan Wood, and for the most part as I was reading it I really did get wrapped up in Toru Watanabe's romantic struggles with gloomy, flawed Naoko and the pretty, wild Midori.  The setting was effective (a Tokyo university in the late 1960's), and the novel had a very real, contemporary feel that appealed equally well to Western audiences as well as Murakami's native Japan. However after finishing it I thought perhaps Murakami poured on the pathos a little too thickly for my liking, and so I am a little ambivalent about this book.<br />The book is narrated years after the fact by Watanabe, an introspective college student without much ambition, who disdains the hypocritical college radicals of his time and who befriends a quirky roommate, nicknamed Storm Trooper, who is a social misfit (and the butt of jokes) but who keeps their dorm room meticulously clean.  We learn at the outset of a great loss, as Toru's young friend Kizuki unexpectedly killed himself at age 17, leaving a huge void in the lives of both Toru and Naoko, Kizuki's longtime girlfriend.  These two characters struggle with varying degrees of success to deal with the suicide, and develop a special kinship that seems doomed from the outset.<br />At the same time, Toru has a series of one night stands with a new buddy, a wealthy over-achiever who makes everything look easy, until Toru meets Midori, a breath of fresh air who says whatever is on her mind (usually sexual in nature) and who looks for the undivided attention and affection Toru is reluctant to give. All of this is well and good, but I think about half way through the novel gloom factor goes off the charts.  <br />We learn that suicide has touched Naoko's family on top of her boyfriend's death, and if that wasn't enough Murakami makes another character's parents both either dead or in the process of dying of brain tumors.  Come on, why not throw in some shocking car wrecks for good measure! And all through these travails, welearn virtually nothing of Watanabe's past, even though he is our introspective narrator.  It just seemed a little overboard to me, trying too hard to move the reader and seemingly impress upon the narrator the fleeting nature of our existence.  <br />Overall I enjoyed the novel,  and from the recent reviews posted, many of my fellow reviewers absolutely loved it. I just think sometimes the writer, a la John Irving, has a tendency to toss in too much tragedy for effect.
B00000JZIK|4.0|Had to write a review on Usual Suspects. Not cause I am a suspense movie fan. But the fact that I gave Pulp Fiction thumbs down, this movie is violent too. But there is so much to the story. Good script &amp; acting by all. And of course Kevin Spacey takes it all. I give it 4 stars and not 5 cause the first 20 minutes or so is so slow and you really don't know what is happening. But when it picks up - it pulls you through with a big bang! Will call it a classic!
0066620694|4.0|Christensen articulates why good management and/or success can lead to failure.  Similar to our discussions in class on business ecology, the stage of &quot;becoming and institution&quot; with no re-engineering or innovation can lead to death for an organization.  This is the notion that Innovator's Dilemma captures and examines. It takes several companies and industries and looks at their history, their framework, their business decisions, and their management to identify what went wrong or what led to their decline.  By finding a common thread related to a lack of innovation or, more specifically, an inability to focus on emerging technologies or opportunities based on a current focus on profit and current customer needs and product/service, organizations prevent themselves from or avoid looking to the future.  It also becomes challenging to look at the futures because the immediate profit margin may not rational from a business standpoint and there is not enough data on new markets to determine long-term ROI (return on investment).  Thus the I never happens, let alone the R.<br />This book made a nice companion to our reading and discussions in the Pepperdine doctoral program in educational technology.  As we look at future thinking, business ecology, leadership, effective management strategies, and technologies as part of the larger educational leadership and technology picture, this book gave some key insight into tangible examples of business practices that are vital for success.  It also became evident that there are consistencies in business through the years, but that real challenges come with progress and change.  The ability for &quot;thinking in the future tense&quot; (another recommended book in the program) and to be adaptive may be the new foundation for business ecology.  It may shift from waiting until the need arises to re-engineer and simply infuse this into business acumen as a constant.  Going beyond trying to improve products, or coming up witha new marketing approach, organizations need to be aware of entirely new markets and products. This gets tricky, but this book lays out some principals to aid an organization or leader in shifting their approach.  It also helps widen perspectives and an organization's view.   I found it interesting reading and insightful (while also easy to read and follow), but not a comprehensive guide to market ownership. There are many key factors in staying competitive and ahead--this book offers one and does it with analytical and tangible examples.
B000002UZ1|5.0|Argon Tape # 2 - Committed to tape on 6/27/85.<br />Beatles 1967-1970 (The Blue album), is a very good representation of the Beatles' output from the late '60s.  Most of their big singles are there (the Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane double-A side, Lady Madonna, Hey Jude, Ballad of John &amp; Yoko/Old Brown Shoe, Get Back, Revolution - others on the compilation may have also been singles, but I've collected solely the albums and I'm not sure which others were...)  as well as songs representing the albums released by the Beatles during this era. <br />There are basically two reasons why I like the Blue album better than the Red.  The first is that, in general, I just like the Beatles from the late '60s more than the early Beatles' recordings - there's just more to them.  Don't get me wrong...I love the early stuff, but their later output just speaks to me and, in my opinion, have more substance to them. THESE ARE EXCELLENT SONGS, FOLKS! The other reason I prefer the Blue compilation to the Red is that it has many songs that I have included on my own personal compilation tape of favorite Beatles songs...There was not nearly as much agreement between the Red Album and my &quot;faves&quot; compilation for their early period.<br />This album is an excellent introduction to the Beatles for people who are just discovering this amazing group's music.  To those people I say that if you like these songs, you will also really like the actual albums from which they came.  They are all classic (even Let It Be)!  So, go start your Beatles collection and buy this compilation!!!
0385474547|1.0|I'm sorry, but this book ranks down there along with Past the Burning Time and Bad Seed, both badly written books forced upon High School Students as a cruel and unusual punishment. While Chinua Achebe claims to be an African freedom activist, her(? I can never figure out these new-fangled names) style of writing is stereotypical of the reactionary Brench and their quest to retain Africa. This book lacks the slightest hinting of a feasible plot written by anyone older than 7, as well as being involving bland and unoriginal characters in a bland and overhyped setting. When was the last time _you_ had some yellow yams, or danced along with Disney in their circle of life? Chinua Achebe had better not quit her(?) day job, 'cause finger painting and exotic dancing are looking up now. STOP WRITING ALREADY!
B00005B6C9|5.0|&quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; not only marks the fifth decade that the Brothers Gibb have been making great music, but also establishes that the Bee Gees are back, better than ever before and at the top of their form.  From the opening title song, to the last rocker, &quot;Voice In the Wilderness,&quot; the Bee Gees provide perhaps the best songs they have ever written, produced and sang.  My personal favorites are &quot;This Is Where I Came In,&quot; &quot;She Keeps on Coming,&quot; &quot;Sacred Trust,&quot; &quot;Man In the Middle,&quot; &quot;Deja vu&quot; and &quot;Walking On Air&quot;  But I think the best track on this album is &quot;Embrace;&quot; what a great song, with Robin on lead vocals.  This song should be to the Bee Gees what &quot;Do You Believe In Life After Love&quot; was to Cher a couple of years ago, yielding them their first #1 on the US charts in over 20 years.  The only song on the album that I really didn't care for was &quot;Technicolor Dreams.&quot;  <br />This album deserves to be a #1 hit for the Brothers, and has at least four songs that should go straight to #1, should American radio decide to play them: &quot;She Keeps On Coming,&quot; &quot;Sacred Trust,&quot; &quot;Wedding Day&quot; and &quot;Embrace.&quot;  The songs are incredible.  The Bee Gees clearly have returned to their early roots.  There is no falsetto, no disco, just great music and those perfect three part harmonies.  This album is truly a masterpiece.  It is a must for all loyal Bee Gees fans.  But I highly recommend it to everyone, especially any critics out there who still think that it's not &quot;hip&quot; to listen to the Bee Gees...you are in for a pleasant surprise. <br />&quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; is, without doubt, THE BEST album ever put out by the Brothers Gib, and proves what musical genuises they really are.  This really is where the Brothers Gibb came in came in some 35 years ago; just three brothers making really great music together.
078401213X|2.0|Forget the hype and ignore the five-star ratings too lavishly bestowed on it by others. The film is a promising debut for its director Darren Aronofsky and, hopefully, more substantial things can be expected from him in future when he has a bigger budget available and has matured to the point where he no longer feels the need to make studenty, art-house gestures. Intellectual labour is a difficult thing to dramatize and so, not surprisingly, there is not much here in the way of plot progression. The film is more of a portrait than a story: a portrait of a young and brilliant mathematician, inching anxiously forward to some momentous discovery. Predominant images are those of his face wracked in pain at some unspecified ailment, numbers billowing along a computer screen, and his cluttered room where he lives a reclusive existence, intent only on his work. Ultimately unsatisfying, (the plot strands concerning the fanatical Jews and the corporate thugs don't go anywhere much), and splashed too liberally with yawn-worthy surrealist scenes, the film is nonetheless worth watching and its director even more so. Just don't expect too much.
0312952813|4.0|A cop is found in a motel, apparently the victim of suicide. Harry Bosch isn't so sure. He finds a connection between the dead cop and the importation of a new designer drug called black ice which is coming from Mexico. His investigation, which for the most part is unauthorised, takes him from his home turf in LA, down to the US - Mexico border.<br />This is the second Harry Bosch book, following on from The Black Echo, and Harry Bosch is proving to be a real rebel in the LAPD. The action comes thick and fast when Harry's on the trail, and no stone is left unturned, either legally or otherwise. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the hard-boiled police procedural genre.

0790742780|5.0|When this movie was first released on the big screen, I read many reviews by professional reviewers that blasted it for its racial stereotypes and overall negativity. I had to go see what all the fuss was about, and I am so glad I did. I left the theater thinking this was one of the best movies I had ever seen, and my opinion has not changed to this day. First off, the movie would not work without the stereotypes. They are essential to our view on how Michael Douglas' character sees the world he lives in. The movie is violent, negative, and very sad, but that atmosphere is offset by a sense of humor that is worked in brilliantly. I got the impression that the writer and director did not compromise their message in any way, and thus I am surprised that this film actually got made in these days of political correctness. Bottom-line: This movie is not about politics or race or good vs. evil. It is simply the tragic story about one typical man and his inevitable fall into obscurity. I think we can all relate to his sadness more than we admit.
B000022TT4|4.0|Having never been to a U2 concert, but still being a fan of their music, I bought this DVD to experience the band at the height of their artistic powers, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint one bit.  If you're fortunate enough to have a decoder with a &quot;Live Stadium&quot; setting, this would be the DVD to play it on.  Tracks that particularly stood out were &quot;bullet the blue sky&quot; and &quot;with or without you&quot;, both of which highlighted the band's excellent showmanship with the use of very effective stage lighting.  Not too be missed also is Bono's political statement made in &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, finished of nicely with &quot;in the name of love&quot;.  If you don't get goosebumps at some stage of watching this....you're probably dead.  The ultimate concert DVD by far
0064407667|5.0|-It starts with Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. They are all very creative. I have no idea how everything got so terrible for them. I can't believe that a house fire could make their lives so misrable.  -For example, cooking for Count Olaf and his drunken crew, chopping wood for no apparent reason, almost marrying your worst nightmare, and watching their baby sister Sunny dangle out of a forbiddon tower. I wouldn't be able to stand it.  -It would have been much nicer living with their neighbor. I have read the books up to number 4. i think that they have beat out harry potter by a trip to the moon and back.<br />                                           Alison

B00005BJ2O|5.0|Bought Moulin Rouge for one reason and one reason alone. David Bowie doing a cover of &quot;Nature Boy&quot;. But believe it or not, the entire cd is fantastic. Luhrmann's &quot;Romeo+Juliet&quot; was an excellent soundtrack, don't get me wrong- but it's been years since there has been a great movie soundtrack that coincides with the movie. One thing though- this is not something to buy on the basis of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. It's not like that. I guess I'm a little opionated, but.. well, that's what I think. Overally, it's really good.
B00001NFCY|1.0|Granted, Strap should be excited about his child, and a song for him (or her) is a splendid idea.  However, it should be a simple accoustic song, hidden at the end of the tracks. There is no need to craft an absurd opus, particularly when you have limited vocal range.  Perhaps that is why he chose a violin laden song for &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;, because he does not have the vocal talent to carry an accoustic song.<br />By the way, could someone explain to me the line, &quot;I lie beneath the tree of wisdom/ Your ax is cut and would you be there???(What If)
0446608955|4.0|A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks was intriguing and inspirational. This book gave the reader a true insight to each character, especially the protagonist, a teenage boy who is trying to find himself. Sparks is a talented writer who displays many literary techniques. The author used first person narrative, in which the story was told from a teenage boy's perspective. As a reader, you grew through the experiences and commentary of the narrator. Spark's writing style is very detailed and it delivers a very direct message. His writing is not very complex or challenging, however, he has the ability to completely capture the attention of a reader. Spark's is a very deep individual. It is as if he has captured the meaning of falling in love and loving those people for who they truly are. He uses a great deal of narrative commentary, allowing the reader to gain and to grow from the characters' thoughts. He also uses allusions to the bible towards the end of the novel. There are many passages in the book from Psalms and Proverbs. These allusions challenge the reader to focus on what the character is thinking and experiencing. Sparks delivered many inspirational themes throughout the novel. There was a definite theme of love, and also a theme of the ability to learn to look beyond what society has stereotyped a person to be. A young teenage couple falls in love and the boy overcomes the fact that he is falling for a reverend's daughter who has been stereotyped as a \\"goody goody nerd.\\" This book is a definite page-turner, which will bring a tear to the reader's eye and give him or her a whole new perspective of what it means to fall in love.
0440180295|5.0|In Kurt Vonnegut's excellent novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut skillfully applies rhetorical strategies such as his unique use of science fiction, reiterated phrases, and a timely use of flashback to convey his repressed but resentful view of war in general and especially his personal experience with the Dresden firebombing. In a separate approach Vonnegut uses the all-seeing Aliens from Tralfamadore to express his view that the best way to live life is by focusing on the positive memories.<br />Vonnegut begins his novel with a personal memoir explaining the beginnings of his \\"great\\" war novel. In a conversation with Mary O'Hare, to whom the book is dedicated, Vonnegut assures her that his war book will not glorify war and that, in fact, he will name the book \\"The Children's Crusade\\" to show that war is not fought by grown men but by a younger generation, the children. The focus for the novel is set. <br />In this memoir Vonnegut chooses to introduce the phrase \\"so it goes\\" and the ice motif that will be used throughout the novel. The ice motif begins when Harrison Starr says, \\"Why don't you write an anti-glacier book instead?\\" (3) He meant that stopping war is as easy as stopping a glacier. Similar to the meaning of the glacier the words \\"blue and ivory\\" are used throughout to describe dead soldiers and the protagonist of the story, Billy Pilgrim \\"There was so much to see--dragon's teeth, killing machines, corpses with bare feet that were blue and ivory. So it goes.\\"(65) \\"He looked down at his bare feet. They were ivory and blue.\\" (72) This motif about ice is used throughout the book to represent death and the frailty of man. \\"So it goes\\" is the phrase that is used more that anything else in the novel. The actual meaning of the word is introduced as a Tralfamadorian philosophy. Death is inevitable and nothing can be done to prevent it. The best way to cope with it is not to focus on it. Instead of focusing on death focus on life and the enjoyable memories that that come with it. The Tralfamadorian philosophy is also Vonnegut's philosophy and is the philosophy that I believe allowed him to get through the Dresden tragedy.<br />Science fiction and flashback played great parts in this novel and also served the same purpose. They allow Vonnegut to keep a safe mental distance from the painful Dresden experience. As the first chapter states, Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time. Billy's life is basically chopped up and rearranged to fit with his time travel experiences. This distortion of time serves two purposes. First, it shows the reader how war is. War is confusing and disorienting. It can change a man just as it changed Billy Pilgrim. Second, it allows Vonnegut to explain the confusion of war without directly explaining war. The war experience is still very painful to him. Vonnegut uses a flashback instead of Billy's usual time travel to explain the Dresden bombing. \\"He did not travel in time to the experience. He remembered it shimmeringly...\\" (177) Like Vonnegut, Billy cannot revisit that experience though he has no problem visiting his own death. Also, the use of the Tralfamadorians could be interpreted as a way to distance him from the reality of war. Through the use of the slightly humorous aliens Vonnegut is able to express his philosophies about death.<br />This slightly confusing book is full of rich and deep messages for the thoughtful, but is also simple and short enough for the average reader. The disconnected passages keep the reader's attention while at the same time making the reader think and reflect on what has already been said.
B0000029LG|5.0|I can't deny that I enjoy the music of Jackson. This 2cd set is quintessential Jackson. If you only want one album of his, then this should be the one to get. Disc one includes most of his greatest hits...the songs he will be most remembered for from his best period. The 2nd disc is newly recorded material, and is a bit of a mish-mash, some good, some not so, but still worth having. The only thing that sort of annoys me, is the self-idolizing that Jackson includes in the 52 page booklet. There is a whole page written by Elizabeth Taylor, extolling Michael's virtues, calling him innocent, unearthly and childlike. (Gimme a break...it's enough to make one gag). Then there's another page written by Jaqueline Kennedy Onasis and yet another by Steven Spielberg. Both saying practically what a great human being Michael is. And then near the end, a note by Michael saying how devoted he is to the children of the world, and how he vows to help the sick and homeless children. It's a little too much, when you think of the scandals surrounding him not long before this album was released. But, that aside, the music here is great, and Jackson is a terrific artist and showman, and that does stand out here. But we really could have done without the self worship.
B00003CXP1|5.0|...I will say that it is the most brilliant movie I have ever seen. Not only is the plot deeply shocking and fascinating, the cinematography is spectacular, with rich colours and sparely (but effectively) used CGI to emphasise the drug hallucinations. However the thing I liked most about this movie that really \\"clicked\\" with me was its repetitive image sequences. It had a strangely hypnotic effect and also tied in SO well with the drug theme. Every time one of the characters hit up, so was the audience hit up with a visually interesting image sequence which repeated throughout the movie. One interesting point to note is from memory, a drug injection was only shown once in 'real life'. The rest of the times, the image sequence was shown. I liked this because although the movie did not avoid the unpleasantness of drugs (far from it), it did not gratuitously sicken the audience by directly showing the shooting up all the time.
B000002UA9|4.0|The closest you can come to hearing quality recordings of the Beatles pre-Sullivan stage show, PLEASE PLEASE ME documents the Beatles just stepping out of the shadow of the 1950s, searching for their own voice.<br />Luckily for them (and us) the Beatles listened to everything and covered only the best.  It's hard to go wrong with Goffin/King (&quot;Chains&quot;) or Burt Bacharach (&quot;Baby Its You&quot;), and even the lesser known stuff--&quot;Anna&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot;--works in the hands of the Beatles.  Thier best cover, &quot;Twist &amp; Shout,&quot; crackles here, and the first major set of McCartney/Lennon originals are pearls.<br />As great as this album is, who could have guessed in '63 that it was only prelude, and would be considered a minor work by Beatle standards?<br />Other than Brian Epstein?
B00003CWN2|5.0|Very moving film about a transgendered youth, Brandon Teena. His tragic life is chronicled in an extremely well acted movie by all. Without a doubt, Hilary Swank is the most deserving recipient of the Best Actress Academy Award in the past 12 years. It makes you think twice about the hatred out there, and the need to start accepting people as they are, as they choose to be. A person who's different in one way may be the kindest person, kindest soul;.... The human side of pain is incredibly well illustrated by Hilary and Chloe. Please be provoked from this film to examine your own life and how you treat others who are different from you.
B0000067L3|3.0|For all of Clapton's talent--and he is one of the 5 greatest guitar players of his generation, don't let anybody kid you about that--he displayed an amazing lack of ability to judge material.  <br />For all the talk of his sticking to his &quot;blues roots&quot; when he jumped the Yardbirds ship, the tune they argued over wasn't much different than what they'd been doing for nearly a year, and every band he landed in for several years followed basically the same recipes.<br />As anyone wh has seen the film of Cream's live performances or saw the band in person can testify, they were a thundering group, three manic musicians who could really set a place afire, even if they did tend to take the late-60's penchant for endless solos to new lengths.  Unfortunately, the power of those performances doesn't really transfer to an audio-format: the live stuff here is ponderous, at best.<br />The studio stuff is wild; the production is skewed in an effort--generally successful--to bring the bass and drums forward to an even keel with guitars and vocals.  It takes a little getting used to , but it's a taste worth aquiring.<br />I've always loved &quot;Pressed Rat &amp; Warthog,&quot; though I wonder how the Clapton who turned up his nose at the Yardbirds allowed himself to appear on it.
0345363132|5.0|Penman's novel The Sunne in Splendour is one of the finest fictional treatments of Richard III in existence (perhaps only Josephine Tey's Daughter of Time is in the same league).  Unlike Weir, who had absolutely no basis for forming the conclusions she drew and whose manipulation of her sources is maddening, Penman's portrait and conclusions are eminently logical and psychologically reasonable.  No one knows what happened to those &quot;princes in the tower,&quot; but Penman's explanation is more than satisfying--it just sounds right.  She is not the first to vincdicate Richard, but she is among the best.  For a historian's handling of the same material, you might want to try Paul Murray Kendall's &quot;Richard the Third&quot; (see especially Appendix I where Kendall presents all of the evidence both for and against Richard--nothing in Penman contradicts any of the evidence; one cannot say the same for Weir!).
0783225903|5.0|This is the director's edition from the Criterion Collection.  I had expected to receive the original version on DVD so I sold my vhs copy.  Disappointed!!  Still...this is some amazing film making from Terry Gilliam.  Everyman, dreamer Pryce chases the girl of his dreams thru a dark and selfish futuristic world.  It's so easy to get swept up in Brazil that you lose sight of the films flaws.  Also, the visuals are so nightmarish and disturbing at times that you'll recall these moments long after it's over.  I can still hear the shreaks of that woman, \\"What have you done with his body....?\\" and Michael Palin in the baby mask.  There's just so many visions that will stick with you.  The lady typing EVERYTHING she hears...it's so bizarre.  And now it's all in glorious DVD!<br />My version had very little extras.  There was a terrific trailer that made me want to immediately watch the movie again. As for the sound and picture I'd prefer a cleaner picture.  It was actually a bit grainy most of the time.  The sound was pretty good.  If I had it to do over I'd buy the ... Criterion Edition.  I actually plan to do that anyway.
B0000026WD|5.0|This album is the best I own, and I own a ton!!  Michael is such a crafter of songs, such a magic-maker, and it is never more evident than on this cd.  He literally blows away ANYONE who might try to compete.  This cd is so diverse, without seeming schizophrenic.  He has songs that display a growing ferocity in his music, and then he has songs that just make you want to be his friend more than anything.  He is obviously one of the most influential singers of today.  Ask any male (and many female) singer who his influences are, and he'll be sure to say Michael Jackson.  This is because of such masterfully produced albums as this.  And don't think he's finished yet!  Michael has a new cd slated for release during the summer.  Prepare to be knocked flat on your back one more time...
014028009X|5.0|Having been a fan of the book before I even heard there was a movie, I have to say I'm afraid I'm going to invoke the old cliche -- the book was better. If you're new to the BJ world, please meet the most hilarious neurotic &quot;singleton&quot; ever to come out of Britain, and never look back.<br />This is a hilarious book, so true in so many ways. It's very reminiscent of my other current fave, Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf. Because these books are funny, people often overlook, I think, that there's more under the surface. Both of these great contemporary novels contain very sharp observations about love and lust in the modern world.<br />All of Bridget's insecurities ought to add up, you might think, to just feeling sorry for herself, or for never trying anything risky. Oh, how wrong you'd be! You MUST read this book!
B00005AXEL|5.0|Hats off to the gypsy that remains true to herself. What a breath of fresh air in this era of karioke singers acting out other peoples' music.  From start to finish, this cd rocks!  Mulitiple producers and collabrators do nothing to interrupt this cohesive collection.  It doesn't matter if a song on this cd is rocking hard, mid-tempo groovin', country twang or sensitive ballad- it obviously belongs to Stevie Nicks and her alone (ever heard a good cover of a Stevie Nicks song?) Her soul comes through her lyrics, music, and voice like very few artists I've ever heard.  <br />Definitely the best cd I've bought in years.  But then again, I love Street Angel, which seems to have bad reviews.  Try that one again too.
0553212737|5.0|I just reread this treasure for my book club.  I first read it when I was about seventeen, and I loved it as much this time as I did then.  It is truly a joy to read such wonderful writing and be so sweetly entertained.<br />The character of Emma is so fully realized and believable.  Her ineptness as a matchmaker simply adds to her appeal, and makes you love her even more for her shortcomings.  And the inevitable romance that finally comes to be near the end of the novel is so completely rewarding, that you will be smiling broadly as you read the last few pages.<br />Of Austen's novels, I've only read Emma and Pride and Prejudice.  After completing Emma for the second time, I'm eager to pick up her other books and lose myself in her enchanting narrative.
0062502182|5.0|This book is simply the best book that I have ever read.  It is simple and easy to read, but contains the most important of messages.  If everyone read this book and learned to follow their heart I believe that their would be a much needed change in every person's life.
0679721037|4.0|This is one of those books that is worth the price of admission many times over.  It contains the stories of several survivors of the nuclear bombardment of Hiroshima, from what they were setting out to do that fateful morning until how their lives turned out decades latter.<br />The first portion of the book, dealing with the survivors' stories of the bombing and its immediate aftermath, was the stronger of the two.  It was as haunting, mesmorizing, and terrifying read as I have ever had, yet weighed in at only about a little over hundred pages.  The latter portion of the book, which Hersey added years later to show how his subjects' lives had turned out, was somewhat disappointing.<br />Overall, this is still an excellent book, whose haunting images will remain with you for the rest of your life.  Well worth a few bucks and a couple of hours.
B0000027RL|5.0|The name is Ten, but I can only give it 5 Stars.. In 1991, the world was given it's first taste of a band that has influenced music of the 90's more than any other band.  Pearl jam's debut album is jam-packed with some of the most recognizable song's in the pearl jam library.  This album is first sample the amazing, lyric-filled brain of Ed Vedder that has given all pearl jam albums a reputation for greatness that will surely stand the test of time.  Songs like Jeremy and Black are well known all over the world and are still favorites of even the die-hard pearl jam fans like myself.  I've always thought that you're not a true pearl jam fan unless you know the song Once, word for word. This was one of the first cd's I ever bought, and it should definatley be a part of everyones cd library even if you're not a die-hard pearl jam fan.  Get this CD, and ya never know, maybe you'll become the next die-hard fan :)
B00004RC23|5.0|This is one of the BEST Pet Shop Boys CD's EVER!  This one has somgs in both English and Spanish (Discoteca, and Single) and has some really good Dancable songs like Before and my favorite is Saturday Night Forever.  If you like the Pet Shop Boys, Get this one!  Im suprised its only available as an Import and not Domestic anymore.
B000009VOL|3.0|Cat Power is a unique band. Chan Marshall is in her own way unique. Some might describe that as a bad thing at times, but at other times Chan can really surprise you. I've heard everything off of Moon Pix and every other album Cat Power has ever created and I must say that Cat Power enthusiasts highly over rate  Chan Marshall. Describing her voice as otherworldy is humorous, indeed. Her lyrics are at times interesting but carry no weight with them. The songs are very simple, written in 3 chord. Over all, the music is plain jane and not truly witty or charismatic. The reason it holds it's audience I could not say. I find no allegiance to Cat Power, myself. The only true reason anyone really listens to Cat Power I feel is that it expresses the mood they're in. But which sane person could say that they never got sick of Cat Power? I know that I personally can only listen to half of a cd usually, and for very good reason. Cat Power lacks wittiness, creativity, charisma, practically everything. Chan Marshall's singing reminds me of a female Kurt Cobain, even at times Ian Curtis. but i find more so that she is like neither because her lyrics sound like words smashed together to no effect. i could definitely say that Cat Power is certainly not the best of indie, emo, or folk. Comparing Chan Marshall's &quot;talents&quot; to the likes of Hank Williams or Bob Dylan is hilarious. She falls extremely short of the two! She falls extremely short of Kurt Cobain, who was a junkie and who's lyrics were barely discernible. I would recommend this light album to a face never been kissed by the at times fluttery yet hard edged emo, but no one above that stature!
B00005221M|5.0|I still remember watching this movie in the theater when it came out and being blown away by the beauty of the cinematography.  It's been almost a decade now and the film still holds up.<br />The dvd is good(except for the complete and utter lack of extras), and the director's cut does basically no horrific damage to the original.<br />If you're a junkie for lush backdrops, a gorgeous score and well shot and bloody battle scenes then give this flick a try.
0790729644|5.0|Clint Eastwood held onto the David People's script for Unforgiven for over 10 years.  Knowing it was something special, he wanted to be mature enough, as both an actor and a director, to do it justice.  It was a wise decision.<br />Eastwood aged into the character of William Munny, chiseled, worn-looking, and I was quite surprised at how well he did with the role.  Munny is a haunted man, burdened with the memories of a violent past and the ghosts of many murders.  His denials &quot;I was drunk&quot; or &quot;I don't remember&quot; are belied by the guilty flicks of his eyes or the thousand yard stare when memory does come back &quot;remember that drover I shot...whose teeth came out the back of this neck?  He didn't do anything....&quot;.  It is all there in Eastwood's face and eyes when later in the film in his fever delirium William Munny sees the Hell he fears is waiting for him for his sins.<br />Reformed by a beloved wife, now dead, and raising 2 children on a failing pig farm, Munny and his old partner Ned (Morgan Freeman) are lured out of retirement for one more killing for money.  But these old outlaws are different men now, older &amp; tired and domesticated, and it seems unlikely they can do the job.  We, like their young gunsel partner, the Scofield Kid, can't see the legendary hell-raiser and killer Munny in this haggard old man.<br />I note that some were put-off by Unforgiven, expecting a Clint Eastwood type western.  Unforgiven really isn't a typical Western...it is more a character study wrapped in a meditation on violence.<br />The violence in Unforgiven is not stylized or glamorized.  When the gunfighter English Bob (Richard Harris) gets the living tar kicked out of him by the sheriff Little Bill Dagget (Gene Hackman), he doesn't pop-up all fine an hour later.  Instead he is layed-up in a jail cell, bloody, swollen, and in pain.  When Little Bill dishes out the same to Eastwood later, William Munny is out for days and is scabbed and scarred afterward.  When Eastwood ambushes a cowboy, he dies slowly, in thirst and in pain. When Little Bill starts in on Ned, we and he know that it will be a long night of torture and pain.  When the Scofield Kid shoots a man in the privy, he is sickened by it and so should we be.<br />Violence begets more violence.  From the initial cutting of the prostitute that sets it all in motion, to the beatings and shootings, the violence here only causes more violence and most of it out of proportion to the crime and most of it, even the sanctioned violence of the Law, has little or nothing to do with justice.<br />Gene Hackman's Little Bill Dagget is a sadistic bully with a badge, his amiable facade masks a ruthless and mean killer.  The bemused twinkle in his eye can turn to a savage taunt in an instant. He enjoys beating people just a little too much, and he has the town cowed under his benevolent tyranny.  Hackman is great and deserved his Oscar.<br />The only nod to the conventions of the Western is in the last act, but we are ready for it.  As  William Munny swigs the first whiskey he's had since his wife reformed him we watch him become distant, stronger, icier and resolved, the legendary stone-cold killer we've been hearing about throughout the movie is now before us and out for revenge.<br />The rainy ride into town and the total surprise of the laughing and confident posse-in-the-making, the cool malevolence... &quot;he better arm himself if he's going to decorate his saloon with my friend&quot;... and the chaotic, awkward, chance and luck shootout that kills the guilty and the innocent indiscriminately, caps the theme of the film... &quot;deserve's got nothin to do with it&quot;.  Violence is just violence, it is haphazard and unfair.  It isn't pretty and it isn't justice.<br />And killers leave death in their wake and go on to &quot;prosper in Dry Goods&quot;.<br />This is a beautifully realized film with a great cast. Eastwood's direction is fine.  His pacing here is deliberate, but may be off-putting to those expecting a more action-oriented film.  This is a mature work, it improves on repeat viewings. Each scene fits to lay the foundation for the climactic confrontation,which is one of the best ever.  The dialogue is nuanced and revealing of character and motivation.  This is first-rate filmaking.
B00005B6C9|3.0|I'm a LONG time Bee Gees fan and this CD has some decent tracks but I'm not crazy about it for a few reasons: 1-The album just has too much of an &quot;Electronica&quot; pop sound.  It seems to digress from the Bee Gees roots of R&amp;B and ballads which was what I feel they do best.  Most of the tracks don't feel very deep. 2-Barry's voice is waning these days and on songs like Sacred Trust the Extra Mile he just doesn't sound too good. 3-It feels like a solo album.  Not enough 3 part harmonies.<br />Songs that I like despite their blandish, on the surface charm: Wedding Day- Robin's voice is still addictive and nice.  I love his style. Barry sounds good on this song too.   Walking on Air- Mo' does well with this one and I like the production on it. Title track is decent. Embrace is nice but a little too pop sounding.  I almost wish it was slower and more like the very beginning of the song.<br />It's not a bad effort by the Bee Gees but a just a mediocre CD at best.  As far as their last 3 CD's go,  Still Waters is comparable.  Size Isn't Everything beats it easily.<br />The Bee Gees are still my favorite group of all time and always will be.
0517548232|1.0|Very Stupid. Once you enslave your mind to a blind, fantasy-based, utopian distortion of capitalist society, which has nothing to do with the actual functioning of that system on any level, at anytime whatsoever (and the top beneficiaries wouldn't have it any other way - no matter what this economic-libertarian garbage espouse), this is what comes out of your pencil. Read this book, turn off the real world, and turn on to a reactionary and libertarian-utopian rehash of greed, plunder, pillage and plutocracy WORSHIP touted as &quot;common sense.&quot;
B00005ASOC|3.0|This DVD does not work with multi region DVD players. I just received it and it does not work.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is an amazing CD.  The early 90s were a dissapointment for rock records.  There were so many unoriginal bands make unoriginal music.  Then Nirvana came in.  At first, many hated this music, but it soon became the newest fad, and many bands started copying Nirvana's sound.  Any band that has that much captivation is worth checking out.  Smells Like Teen Spirit has basically become an anthem, and was, I believe, in the top 5 of MTVs Greatest Pop Songs countdown.  In Bloom and Come As You Are were also huge songs.  About 8 or 9 of the songs on this album were radio hits, and that shows the amount of talent that went into this.  Definately pick this up.  It's a piece of American musical history.
B000025XE5|4.0|A true anthology of a classic group.
B000056K04|2.0|this cd compared to the lillywhite sessions is like listening to a bunch of bad b-sides.  the people that say they are &quot;true&quot; fans or whatever are taking the easy way out and being mind numbed into believing they cannot have an opinion that is not fully supporting dave matthews band.  as a fan of many years, i can safely say this is not even close to their best work.  to go from an album as good as BTCS to this is a severe drop off and they made an awful mistake to use a producer such as glen ballard.  he screwed up the sound of dmb to the point where you cannot here the famous fiddle playing of boyd tinsley or the superior sax work of leroi moore.  you'd think the band would change it up for the live shows but the songs (particularly angel) sound just as bad live as they do on the cd.  i applaud the band for wanting to change, but this is too much of a change and they sound like a completely different band on this cd.  why they (or maybe it was ballard) changed their sound to fit all the other bubble gum pop junk that is already on mtv is beyond me.  if you want good new dave, get the lillywhite sessions.  in fact, i think LS is some of the best work the band has ever done and i would give it 5 stars.  if you want to complete your collection, get everyday.
B000002A33|5.0|I'm not religious, but this album sounds like it came straight from the pearly white gates of heaven. It embodies everything I think good music should have: a singer who can sing(!), classic pop and psychedelic hooks, fused into a a brilliant heavy rock format. My only regret is discovering this band only weeks before they split up... in fact all my favourite bands are now no more: nirvana, soundgarden, smashing pumpkins... hmmm, I'm just waiting for REM to join the list. Hopefully, soon, there will be a new strain of rock music that can live up to the quality of this record... long live DUST.  ...
B000059XUI|4.0|Much of Superman II was filmed simultaneously with the first movie.  The original plan was to have Superman I end with a cliffhanger: The nuclear missile that Lex Luthor set for Hackensack New Jersey, which Superman diverted into outer space, explodes, shattering the Phantom Zone and setting the three Kryptonian criminals free.  Then the action would freeze-frame, and the screen would flash with &quot;Next Year, Superman II.&quot;<br />Time constraints and studio politics put an end to that scenario.  As the first movie was hastily completed to meet the release date, Superman II was put on hold.  Then, director Richard Donner was fired, and replaced with Richard Lester.  Even though 70% of the second film was complete, much of Donner's footage was reshot by Lester.  In the final film, about one-third of the remaining footage is Donner's.  All scenes with Gene Hackman, Valerie Perrine, Ned Beatty, or E. G. Marshall were shot by Donner.  In addition, the scene at the diner where Clark gets attacked was shot by Donner.  As sequences for Superman II were filmed as much as two years apart from each other, there are glaring continuity problems in the film.  Lester set a different tone than Donner, opting for slapstick humor over the verisimilitude of the first movie.  Also, because of legal difficulties, all footage with Marlon Brando was removed, including a moving scene where Jor-El sacrifices his remaining spirit to return Superman's powers (rather like God touching the hand of Adam).  Anyone who has seen the original script for Superman II knows it would have been a better film if Donner had remained at the helm.<br />So, how is Lester's Superman II?  Pretty impressive overall.  There is ample character development, particularly in the Lois/Clark/Superman love triangle, and plenty of action to keep the viewer satisfied.  The visuals are mostly on the same level as the first movie, although the destruction of the Phantom Zone and the defacing of Mount Rushmore look pretty cheap.  John Williams' excellent score is cannibalized by Ken Thorne, conducting what sounds like a high school orchestra.  So, overall, while entertaining, the movie lacks the epic scope of the first film, and is far less memorable.<br />The letterboxed DVD looks fine is unspectacular.  The sound is flat and unimpressive.  Warner has packaged the DVD in their usual cheap snapper case.tty cheap.

B00000G3I2|4.0|Idealist and radicals who not only seem to think humankind is God's (ha ha) special project but that these self-absorbed, affluent career graduates should be insulated from the ills and bumps of the real world. They can't understand why things haven't turned out as they were suppose to, after all, they were all so committed to solving the ills of &quot;humanity&quot;. These educated, beautiful spirits are joined at the hips in friendship and comeraderie, consoling one another in their grief and broken dreams. They gather for a friend who has died, one of them is filthy rich and they all conveniently stay there, to cry and laugh and fight and be supportive of each other. The scary thing here is that I saw parts of me strolling across this widescreen. I knew it already but it really struck home, again, when I saw this for the first time on DVD. At first you think this story is sympathetic to the plight of these characters, then you realize the real point is the sappy, sentimental silliness of these characters who can't get past their &quot;high ideals&quot;. They're filled with guilt and unfulfilled fantasies. They walk through this weekend in the worst kind of denial, constantly needing sex and support from one another. I hadn't seen &quot;The Big Chill&quot; for a couple of years. For me, it only gets better and more relevant with age. The acting and the actors are terrific. What a powerful cast of then unknowns who would go on to be superstars. If you're looking for an entertaining and thought-provoking movie, this fits the bill. I highly recommend it as your next DVD purchase.
B00000JCB2|4.0|I actually didn't get 3 Dollar Bill Y'all, but was curious about it.  When Significant Other came out I bought it on a whim, and was completely pleased with my purchase.  Everybody has heard Nookie before, the pumped up rock/rap anthem that was playing on the radio for months.  N2 Gether Now is primarily rap (In fact, it got play on urban radio) and is an awesome song.  The guest vocals by Wu-Tang make this track particularly interesting.  Re-Arranged is another sure-fire hit, while the angry Break Stuff had one of the best videos I've ever seen (recently, that is).  The only major downpoint is the excessive cursing.  I'm mature enough to handle explicit lyrics, but when Fred just repeats the f-word again and again, you just have to realize he could have put in more lyrics and made the songs better.  But oh well, nothing can be perfect.  The main reason I love Limp Bizkit is because they are so nice to their fans.  Most artists now do not nearly have the relationships with their fans that Limp does.  They have free concerts, always show up for autograph signings, and even let fans cameo in one of their videos.  That really shows this band is not doing it just for themselves, but for their fans.  I really appreciate it, and I hope they have a long career ahead of them!  With that, I'd like to close my review by screaming &quot;I DID IT ALL FOR THE NOOKIE!&quot;
1577311523|5.0|An awesome book..the author has 'been there &amp; done that' and tells us fellow seekers the secret. I am on my second reading &amp; have passed along several copies to friends who are also on the path. Each has called me to say what a change this book has made in their lives. Eckhart may well become the next Deepak Chopra.
B00000JCOV|5.0|...is the only way i could discribe this. It's a kick a$$ mix of cool guitars, great drum beats and awesome record scraching. It's amazing that Cory (number 8)can go from singing to absoulote screeming so easaly.The music is hard and aggrseive (ideal for after a bad day) but ,unlike other heavy bands i.e. Canable Corpse, has some mealody and is listsonable. The lyrics are good too. This is a must-have C.D. forany fan of heavy music.
B00001OH7X|4.0|I like this album because its out there. Sure,It maybe not his best but, it isn't his worst. D.J. is in my opinion,the best song on the album.

Also included:  &quot;September&quot;, &quot;Boogie Wonderland&quot;, and &quot;After The Love Has Gone&quot;.  A great collection that surpasses the Greatest Hits, Volume 1 package.  Even if you're NOT an EW&amp;F fan, you'll love this.  Treat yourself.

B000002JS0|5.0|High Voltage is an amazing album, in my opinion it captures AC/DC at their all time best, now don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan and seriously like every album but for some reason none of them can even compare to this one. Every song is classic, Angus Young's playing is top notch, the rhythm section of Phil Rudd and Mark Evans is incredibly solid, Malcolm Young also proves that he's the most underrated rhythm guitar player of all time, and what can be said about legendary frontman Bonn Scott, his whiskey drenched voice fits the blues based rock very well. The production on the album is also great courtesy of George Young, older brother of Angus and Malcolm. The album kicks off with one of AC/DC's finest songs ever, It's A Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll. Everything about it is perfect, great solid rhythm and great guitar playing by both of the Young brothers. Rock 'n' Roll Singer is another really cool song, not very different than anything AC/DC's done, but great none the less. The next song is The Jack, this is to this day an in concert favorite, AC/DC's blues influences shine on this one. Live Wire is not anything that you wouldn't expect from AC/DC, great rhythm, top notch guitar playing, and excellent singing. The next song is probably AC/DC's best ever, T.N.T. This is also an in concert favorite, and it's extremely well written. Can I Sit Next to You Girl is another rocker it's then followed by Little Lover which is another blues based song similar to The Jack. She's Got Balls is a classic, the music is awesome and just the song in general is fantastic. Angus is great and Phil Rudd's drums compliment the song, the best part about him is that he doesn't overplay. The album closes with the title track, High Voltage. This song is also amazing, the best part about AC/DC is that even though their songs sound similar they are all really good. So that's it folks the end of one of the greatest albums of all time, only nine songs but not one bad one, this is a must have for any music fan.
B00004XONN|4.0|Well,everyone who says Kid A is groundbreaking,think again before making such a blunt statement. While the album is definetly great,it isnt that original. When hearing this album, I thought, BJORK-HOMOGENIC!  Yes,directly or indirectly Radiohead was influenced by a cd by Bjork called Homogenic. Sound and atmosphere is incredibly similar. So I believe that Kid A is great,though I dont believe it has broken any musical boundaries.<br />               Purchase Homogenic by Bjork for a truly ethereal and emotional experience.
B0000027RL|5.0|In my oppinion, 1991's pearl jam:ten is the best album ever assembled that I have heard.  Songs like once,jeremy,black,alive,porch,garden,release they are all catchy, and this album is what influenced probably 1000 bands from 1992 on to now.  They led the grunge era, and they are a great band.

0767824571|5.0|I have never heard of Monty Python in the early eighties until I saw the &quot;Holy Grail&quot;, I did not expect it to be a funny movie at all and was delighted to see how funny it was. I like it over the &quot;The Life of Brian&quot; which I had to watch two or three times to get all the jokes. I think the reason is I used to read tales of King Arthur as a child but didn't know much about the bible or Jesus. As for the technical specs of the DVD I would give a three only because of the picture quality and sound isn't so good and has no special features which is common with DVD's now. (When are they coming out with a critertion edition?) <br />Anyway, it will always be in my top ten list of movies. I consider it Monty Python's &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;. I don't know why it Leonard Maltin considers it for hard core fans only. My Dad used to show his ninth grade Geography class this movie when they studied Europe. The kids understand most of the movie and they like it. (Though the average kid doesn't get all of it). And I became a fan of Monty Python from watching this one movie.<br />Just wanted to add that I got the Special Edition. It's Awesome!The Lego scene and the Japanese version is funny. What they did was translated from English to Japanese, dubbed it into Japanese and translated back into English. Though all the tranlataions the script changes. (It's two scenes not the whole movie.)
0812550706|5.0|This is one great book! I read it in 3 days and I am only 13! In my school it is consered a classic along side &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; and &quot; David Copperfield&quot;. (And i thought ALL classics were boring) I recomend this to absolutely everyone, even if you hate science fiction.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Wow, this movie is incredable. Utterly and undisputidly the greatest movie ever made. The plot is riviting, and the characters addictive. This move affects you on both the mental and physical level. If you have not watched this movie, you are missing out on something great.
0618135871|4.0|What Philip Roth does so well is create the kind of character complexity that allows the reader to be attracted and repulsed by our randy protagonist at the same time.  Much of this has to do with the fact that Kepesh knows himself so well -- he freely admits when he is using someone for his own erotic desires, his studied seductions of students, etc... Yet, he's also emminently likeable at the same time and not so cynical that he doesn't actually fall in love with Consuela at a deeper level. Consuela is well drawn too and between their interaction, Roth's terrific writing and the smaller scale of this book, I imagine Roth devotees will love this book and even new Roth recruits will understand why he's such a great writer and representer of the  male psyche.
0684874350|5.0|This is an account of a poor Irish Catholic childhood told from the best possible point of view...a childs.  It is an innocent and wonderful journey through heartache and humour and vivid memories of a young boy living in poverty with his younger brothers, his mother and a drunken father.  This book is complex in its relationships and it stirred my soul to its very depth.  I absolutely loved this book and like all great books I didn't want it to end.  I laughed with tears in my eyes and a pain in my heart.  It is the realest story I've ever read.  It is uniquely written by a gifted author who deserves all his praises. TWO very enthusiastic thumbs up!
6305350205|5.0|Okay this movie is totally underated! It has all the great aspects of Star Trek. The interplay between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy is great. And the plot is thoughtful. Shatner did a suberb job of putting together humor and drama. <br />This movie is great because its not what we expected. Some people believe the opposite, but they are wrong. Spock's half brother is the villain! The crew gets brainwashed! Kirk in flannel and jeans! On an intercept course with...GOD! Anti grav boots! Row Row Row your boat! Klingons is hot persuit! <br />If you didn't like this one, you don't understand Trek. Its not about &quot;peserving Roddenberry's vision&quot; its about FUN. ACTION. and a good HONEST MORAL TO THE STORY.<br />This flick has these three things, and Captain Kirk. How can you miss?
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is the greatest movie I have ever watched. Over 144,000 indivisual cells were used, making this excellent quality. The story is breath-taking, and the characters are addictive On both mental and physcal levels, this movie is to please. If you havent watched it, WATCH IT! Your missing on on something great here.
B00000F1D3|5.0|This is a great CD. I think it is one of Cher's best albums. It comes with the smash-hit &quot;Believe&quot; and others. &quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot; on this CD is actually a different version than the one recorded in the 80s. Overall I think this is the best CD I have!
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is Hitchcock at his best.  I believe that this movie was also the peak of James Stewart's and Grace Kelly's career.  Everything in the film is perfect, and the basic cinema is brilliant.  Thelma Ritter was superb and hilarious, also.  The suspense was perfect, especially when Grace Kelly gets involved and of course the most suspenseful part is when Tharwald looks out of the window and sees that he is being watched.  I love this movie so much.
6304383827|1.0|Is this a good adaptation of Jane Austen? No. Are the costumes and characterizations on target? No. Does it have a good script? No. I know that some people do not care for the A&E adaptation of Emma, but it is far superior...Although Jeremy Northam is very handsome as Mr. Knightley, he is the wrong age and his characterization is all wrong. The character in this version is written as something of a whiner. Mr. Knightley is supposed to be a gentleman of great consequence and responsibility. In the A&E version, Mark Strong may not have the \\"looks\\" of Jeremy Northam, but he plays the character the way it is supposed to be and is far more believable. Samantha Morton as Miss Smith is far better than Toni Collette (I like Toni Collette, just not in this movie), and Kate Beckinsale is far better in the title role of Emma than Gwyneth Paltrow. If you are an Austen fan, you will be disappointed with this piece of fluff. I don't care who's starring in it - Jane Austen is a classic author for a reason, and the story should not be changed because some person in Hollywood thinks it needs jazzing up. Should you purchase this video? No.
B000002UAX|4.0|This is an eclectic and interesting two disc CD by The Beatles. It runs the gamut of musical genres: rock, blues, pop, and country/folk. It is wildly divergent in style from their previous release, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", as it is certainly less experimental.<br />It has some great rock based tunes, such as \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", which seems to be a parody of the Beach Boys' sound. It contains a good blues based number, \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\". It also has some interesting country/folk inspired songs, such as \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", and \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\". They also included a song with a British Music Hall feel to it, \\"Honey Pie\\", which leaves me cold. Of course, the requisite upbeat pop song is covered by \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob La Da\\", which I love for its uplifting beat. If you want a pop ballad, you need only to listen to \\"Blackbird\\". This CD has something for everyone.
0062502182|5.0|this book, besides eloquently written and brilliantly constructed, is inspiring and life-affirming.  it's little wisdoms and tidbits of life advice are enlightening.  i have underlined bits, sentences and whole chapters as if it were a textbook.  someimes i just open it up for a quick glimpse at one of these randomly chosen thoughts, and i am left smiling and reaffirmed that yes, my only true obligation is to realize my personal destiny, and to follow that dream in my heart.  a neccesity for any artist struggling to carry out their seemingly impossible dreams in this world.  i will cherish it forever.
B000002UB6|4.0|\\"Let It Be\\", recorded before \\"Abbey Road'' but released last, has been pilloried by critics. While it lacks the finesse of George Martin's magic, it is still a very good album. It has two of Paul McCartney's best vocal efforts on it, in the title song, \\"Let It Be\\", which is beautiful and moving, as well as in the poignant \\"The Long And Winding Road\\". Paul's vocals are also notable in the rocking \\"Get Back\\" track.<br /><br />This album comes closest to making The Beatles sound as they did when they first began recording. This is probably because they performed live for many of the tracks, which gave them the projected warmth of their earlier efforts. While Phil Spector was the producer who cobbled together this recording, he was heavily criticized for his handling of the material. Paul himself chastised him for the arrangement of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\". With The Beatles at odds amongst themselves, however, it was a miracle this recording was put to bed in the first place. Old time fans of The Beatles are thankful that Phil was able to put this last release together. Notwithstanding all the brouhaha, it is still a CD well worth having.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I loved this song, never knew the words or what it was about except gitchee gitchee yaya dada, loved All Saints version, but the four women that are doing it now have just made it into something better.  I don't see how anyone couldn't find themselves moving to the beat of this recording.  It's got soul, funk, rock, rap, everything and it's a song that you already know!  What more could you ask?
0440217563|5.0|The third in a series of exceptionally well written time travel, adventure/romance books by the author, it tells a gripping and highly entertaining tale. There are four such novels published to date in what is hoped to be a series of six books. I urge the interested reader to start at the beginning and read each and every one. Do not be daunted by the length. Trust me when I say that you will wish that they were longer, so riveting a story does the author unfold. A masterful storyteller, the author employs the superlative use of historical events and period detail to weave an engaging three dimensional tapestry of timeless love and adventure. While the core of the story is about a love that transcends time, it is, however, much more than that. It is an adventure story that grips the reader from beginning to end and is positively addictive!<br />The love that spans time is that which twentieth century Englishwoman, Claire Randall, has for eighteenth century Scottish highlands warrior, James Fraser. Those readers who have read the first book in the series, &quot;Outlander&quot;, know that in 1945, Claire, a combat nurse during World War II, is reunited with her husband, Frank, after the war. While on a second honeymoon in Scotland, she visits a strange, flat topped hill, where a forbidding stone circle draws her. Touching one of the stones, she is hurled through a vortex in time and finds herself in eighteenth century Scotland, where she meets a brave and brawny, red headed Scot, James Fraser, with whom she falls head over heels in love. Finding herself thrust into the midst of clan warfare and intrigue, she and her beloved 'Jamie' have enough adventures to last a lifetime.<br />The second book, &quot;Dragonfly in Amber&quot;, is a continuation of that story, told from the perspective of the twentieth century where Claire, now a doctor, has lived for the past twenty years. Upon the death of her twentieth century husband, Frank, Claire returns to Scotland with her grown, red headed daughter, Brianna. There, she discloses to Brianna the events of her secret past, as well as the truth of whom Brianna's biological father truly is and of the love that Claire bore him.<br />While in Scotland, however, Claire discovers something that will forever change her future, as well as her past. You see, for the past twenty years, Claire has mistakenly believed that her beloved 'Jamie' died in the historic battle of Culloden. It was there that the Scottish highlanders bravely fought the English in a misguided attempt to restore Charles Stuart, their bonnie Prince Charlie, to the throne of England, only to be decimated on the battlefield. Those few who survived were branded as Jacobite traitors and imprisoned, and their families disenfranchised. It is this very event that Claire and 'Jamie' had conspired to change, only to fail.<br />Their story transports the reader from the turmoil of the Scottish highlands to the intrigue of the French Court and regales the reader with the adventures of the two lovers, as they conspire to change the very course of history. It was this valiant attempt that ultimately brought Claire and 'Jamie' to the crossroad that would compel them to part and have Brianna become a denizen of the twentieth century.<br />In &quot;Voyager&quot;, Claire, now realizing that the love of her life and soulmate survived the battle of Culloden, makes the decision to go back in time and find James Fraser, as for the past twenty years her love for him has remained constant. Leaving her daughter, Brianna, she once more hurls herself into the vortex of time to eighteenth century Scotland to begin her search for James Fraser, in hope of being reunited with her 'Jamie'.<br />This book tells the story of what happened to Claire Randall and James Fraser in those intervening twenty years. It tells of their ultimate reunion and rediscovery. With historical events as a backdrop and an unforgettable cast of characters, it regales the reader with their new adventures, as Claire returns to a still divided, turmoil ridden Scotland. Reunited with James Fraser, none the worse for wear, they seek to make a life for themselves. As their love comes full circle, they take to the high seas, and their adventures continue.

B000056K04|2.0|What a dissapointment. I pains me to read these reviews that say &quot;5 Stars! The first DMB album I ever liked, fresh new sound!&quot; This should a pretty clear sign to any real Dave fan that there is something very wrong with this album. There are a few good songs, Space Between and others. This album is far from terrible, but if you compare it to Daves other stuff, this album makes me want to cry! <br />The weak points of this album are, most importantly, lyrical depth. Lyrically this album can't touch the old stuff, I think &quot;I Did It&quot; speaks for itself. Although DMB does write more whisimical, non-sensical lyrics from time to time i.e. &quot;Too Much&quot; so I wouldn't say these are sellout songs or anything, they just aren't the types on DMB songs that I really like. Secondly these songs lack alot of the jams and the really soulful feel of his other songs. I guess these songs sound a bit more &quot;pop&quot; to me.<br />I can't wait until they stop playing &quot;I did it&quot; on the radio and all these cheese-balls jump off the DMB bandwagon. Hopefully by the next album the band will be back their old ways, I know they still have it in them!!
B000002UB3|4.0|\\"Abbey Road\\" was the last album The Beatles recorded as a group, though the \\"Let It Be\\" album was the last recording they released. This was certainly the end of an era, and none of The Beatles would go on to match the success that they had enjoyed collectively as one of the most imaginative, talented, and successful groups ever to grace the music industry.<br /><br />\\"Abbey Road\\" is an excellent recording. Interestingly enough, one of the best tracks on the album, and certainly his best effort, is George Harrison's \\"Something\\". This album has many good songs from which the listener may choose, however, and the tracks on it are as diverse in feeling as The Beatles themselves. The reality is that this album remains best known for the fact that this would be the last recording by The Beatles. As such, no music collection should be without it.
0780631684|5.0|After thinking about all the DVD's I brought and watched last year, Final Destination stands out as one of the best. The movies awesome and the DVD is just as impressive. There are tons of extras which you can view and it'll keep you busy for hours.<br />The movie itself is also good. It's fast paced, suspenseful and filled with in joke humor and it also stands up to repeated viewings. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat!
B000002UDB|5.0|The psychedelic epiphany in which The Beatles indulged brought forth some of their best and most innovative efforts. While only six of the tracks were written for The Beatles' television film, \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", and the other five tracks, comprised of their singles' releases for 1967, were later added for purposes of an album release, it all works. In fact, two of the songs, \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", originally were written for their \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" album but were ultimately dropped, as they did not fit the creative concept upon which they were working at the time. It is almost hard to believe that these two great songs were originally each a side of the same single release.<br /><br />There are, however, a lot of other great songs on this CD. Each and every one of them stands alone on its own merits. While \\"Penny Lane\\", a richly evocative, nostalgic refrain, is my own personal favorite, there is a variety from which to choose. From the haunting \\"The Fool On The Hill\\" to the psychedelic drug infused \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" to the rocking rhythyms of \\"Baby You're A Rich Man\\", there is a song for everyone. This a CD no avid music collector should be without. For those who love The Beatles, this CD will serve to remind them as to why they love them.
0446608955|4.0|Nicholas Sparks successfully wrote this novel to inspire and acquire a large audience that would recommend it to others.  This novel incorporates its title throughout, to make it an interesting reading.  By continually using walks with main characters (Landon and Jamie) you are left in suspense to discover the &quot;Walk to Remember&quot;.       The main theme is finding love.  However, many twists are added that make finding love and falling in love the most difficult thing in the main character Landons seventeenth year.  One twist being that Landon and Jamie are contrasting characters, and neither of them nor the reader expects the outcome.  Another twist is the contrast in both Landon and Jamie's families.    The author also uses religion to separate Landon and Jamie.  But ironically uses a bible of Jamies late mother to bring them closer.        However, by far the best part and writing of the novel is the ending chapters.  The end of the novel is the most inspiring part of the novel, leaving you in hopes that you will have the miracle of falling in love at least once in your life. The ending is written to bring tears to almost anyone's eyes.  After finishing the last line I found myself rereading the final chapters.        I would recommend this novel to anyone who has fallen in love, or to those who find themselves still searching for love.

There are four such books published to date in what is anticipated to be a series of six books. Those of us who are hopelessly addicted to this series are awaiting the publication and release of book five, &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot;.<br />I urge the reader to start at the beginning and read each and every one in the order in which it was written. Be not afraid of the length of each book. Trust me when I say that you will end up wishing that they were each longer, so riveting is the story that the author unfolds. Ms. Gabaldon is a master storyteller without compare, employing the superlative use of actual historical events with authentic period detail to weave a three dimensional tapestry of timeless love and adventure.

By the time Brianna catches up with them, an event has occurred in her life which may have the impact of forcing her to stay mired in the past.<br />This fourth book in the series is a bit of a disappointment, as it could have used some serious editing due to the author's self indulgence. Moreover, the characters are not so well drawn, as they are in the first three books in the series. Unfortunately, a pivotal character, that of Brianna, is uncharismatic and comes across as somewhat vapid and stupid. Brianna definitely needs work, if she is to capture the readers' imagination as have Claire and 'Jamie'. At the stage of development in which she is, Brianna would be unable to sustain another book. The same goes for Roger, who comes across as somewhat one dimensional, though he does have potential, as he seems to have a latent smoldering and sensual quality to his personality.<br />Still, notwithstanding some of these issues, this remains a compelling time travel saga, and my thirst for a fifth volume remains undiminished.

B000002UC5|4.0|I have been listening to this on and off for over 20 years now. This album was quite simply a gem.<br />The simple recording techniques used (4 track studer and overdubs) lend to the charm of the work.<br />Musically, the album has moments of sheer inspiration (&quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot;, &quot;Every Night&quot;). But there are no bad songs on here.<br />The overall feel of the album is very casual, laid back, and relaxing, but it is by no means an acoustic album, as electric guitar and good drumming abound. My personal opinion is that the album has aged much better that Beatles &quot;Let It Be&quot; album, both of which were recorded at around the same time.<br />Highly recommended, and Paul's next album was to be even better!
6305066345|4.0|This is a movie about basketball.  It's a Spike Lee film too.  So it's bound to express his well-known love for the game.  As we can expect from him, his view is a fresh, uncompromising one.  There's a harsh reality behind all the exaggerations and hype.<br />The story surrounds a high-school basketball star with the unlikely name of Jesus and the most important decision he must make in his life -- what college basketball scholarship he will accept. Temptations are everywhere and everyone around him feels entitled to some of his future financial success.  Denzel Washington plays his father who is serving a long prison sentence for murdering his wife, the boy's mother. However, the governor wants the boy to go to his alma mater and therefore grants him a week out of prison to also influence the boy.<br />Spike Lee's camera seeks out the outrageous details that add the wince, the pow and the dimension to the film.  It explores human nature as well as some ugly truths using the vehicle of the story as an allegory.  The music is an eclectic mix of Aaron Copeland and Public Enemy and somehow it works. And there are also cameo performances by real live basketball players and coaches.<br />I enjoyed the video and can even forgive the fact that it was a little too long and that some of the acting did not measure up to Denzel Washington's superb performance.  Spike Lee fans will love it.  Recommended.
6305910103|5.0|Especially improved is the sequence where Enterprise is first seen, in the first film, it was an overlong boring scene that brought the story to a halt at just the wrong moment. Wrath of Kahn has great pacing and story throughout, and avoids the totally un-needed &quot;reunion&quot; scenes. The reunion we do get is Kirk and an old and worthy adversary, and it is worth it. The nebula battle scene still holds up.
0452282152|4.0|This novel, by Tracy Chevalier, is a fictional story about the young lady in the famous Vermeer painting from the mid 17th century.  There are just a few facts known about his life, and nobody knows who the girl actually was, but the author did the best she could to stay true to the world of Vermeer and the Dutch masters of the time.  She obviously did extensive research into his art, as well as daily life in Holland at that time.  The result is this small gem of a book.<br />The writing is simple, told in first person narrative, by Griet, who, at 16 years old, became a maid in Vermeer's household.  Life in the 17th century comes alive as she describes the details of her daily tasks as well as the tensions between the various people living in the house.  The writer uses excellent character tags and paces the books so the reader just wants to keep turning pages.  Along the way, we learn about art and the specific techniques that the painter used for mixing colors.<br />It is a nice story and everything falls into place. Griet is wide eyed and innocent but just a little too perfect for my taste, however.  The other characters seem to have more depth. Vermeer is the most complex.  And so is the butcher's son who courts Griet with blood under his fingernails as well as Griet's brother who is apprenticed to a Delft tile maker.  Sometimes it felt like I was reading a romance novel based on just a few scanty facts and I was annoyed at those times, well aware that what I was reading was not necessarily the truth, but just a figment of the author's imagination.  At other times I felt I was right there in Vermeer's studio, noticing how the light caught the face of his subjects, sensing the smell of linseed oil and viewing the world through the painter's eyes.<br />I cannot make the book what it is not however, and do applaud the author for bringing this work of art to the public by means of this novel.
6303201954|3.0|At the time many were so glad for a new Trek, that we ignored the flaws in this ambitious undertaking.<br />There are many, not the least of which is a plodding pace that prevents the movie from ever building up any momentum. Every time we are on our way, something stops the action. Much time is wasted explaining how the gang got back together. The &quot;protaganists&quot; are given little chance to do much protaganizing, and the ending is a rehash of an old '60s episode.<br />Ambitious effects make the Enterprise look better than perhaps any version before or since, and later scenes portraying the intruder are spectacular, if a bit slow.<br />The high point of the movie is the soundtrack, that mixes a sense of wonder and danger using many unusual sounds and orchestration to achieve a perfect otherworldly effect. <br />There will be a director's cut DVD soon, that has some newly reworked scenes and effects, and it will be interesting if some of the flaws are corrected in that version.
0380713802|5.0|I believe there are more than enough reviews here to decifer whether or not you plan to read this  charming, witty and candid book. However, as an Australian raised in both Europe and America, I must heed a warning to those of you who read the negative reviews by Europeans and Asians. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!! They obviously lack a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at themselves (unlike Bryson).  Bryson can be provincial at times, but he is so charming indeed! One who has traveled for days in a foreign land can understand his exhaustion and frustration and will howl with laughter.<br />Yes, Bryson at times can be brutally honest with his opinion of foreign countries and their inhabitants and culture, but they are HIS OPINIONS and they are frankly FUNNY and quite observant. I suppose those who take offense to his opinions neglected to understand that Bryson is a brazen self critic  and will unabashedly admit to his lack of sophistication due to his stereotypical midwestern American upbringing. Please take no notice to the malevolence of the quazi-sensitive and humourless French and Germans who negatively reviewed this charming and engaging work. <br />Give the man a break and give this book a READ...Unless you possess absolutely no sense of humour, you will find it quite enjoyable!
0679879269|5.0|This book surpasses harry potter by 10,000,000 stars and if you haven't read it you've commited a capital crime.  There is no book like it but please do not insult it by forgetting to read the first two(The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife).  Pullman shows the characters souls and leaves you weeping your heart out.  At first I thought that it was going to suck like all sequels but now it is my favorite book of all time. Pullman is the greatest author in the world and if you like this than read all the rest!
1558908323|4.0|This movie wasn't perfect but what I liked most is that in most horror movies people do exactly the wrong thing. The typical example is a Friday the 13th movie where even though people are dead nobody calls the police, people go in the basement or outdoors alone etc..<br />In Mimic, none of that happens.  Each action that takes them further into danger is a logical progression.  They did basically what you'd expect almost anybody to do in a given situation.<br />I don't understand the couple of completely negative comments that are up here.  Seems like they were watching a different movie like &quot;Relic&quot; which came out about the same time but was horrid.

039472903X|4.0|When I first read this book in 1988, it was an inspiration.  Now, thirteen years later, it seems a shade out of step with the times.  Admittedly, that's Ogilviy's whole point - that his concepts are timeless - but I'm not 100% sure I agree.  That said, this is one of the few advertising books that EVERY ad professional or aspiring ad professional should read.  One odd note:  He GOES OFF on ads that use text in all capital letters, yet the cover of his book employs them (to wonderful effect, I might add).  What gives?
B00005B6C9|5.0|I have been sitting on the fence about purchasing and listening to this cd.  I had bought &quot;Still Water&quot; when it had come out a couple of years ago and was pretty disappoined in the release.<br />I just purchased and listened to &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; this afternoon as I was in my car doing errands and have it in my cd/dvd player on my computer as I write this.<br />The very first thing that comes to my mind is that the Bee Gees of the pre Disco era are back and still have what it takes to put out a great cd.  The lyrics are well written and have a story to tell...the music that goes with the lyrics at time soars and most of the rest of the time is very upbeat, relaxing and it puts in you in a better mood.  I find I am even recalling memories of days gone by.<br />About the only song that really doesn't do a thing for me is &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot; and maybe it is a personal problem and not their recording of the song.  I can't seem to get past the first few stanza's even to listen to the lyrics.<br />I find it inspiring for a group to be around for the amount of time the BeeGees have, that the listener can tell that they are still at the top of their career and they ENJOY what they are doing...writing songs and performing!<br />If I had one suggestion to make, if you are like me and sitting on the fence...come off the fence and take a chance on this release!  I was most pleasantly surprised as I prefer the pre-Disco BeeGee's.<br />Try it...you will probably like it!!
B000056V73|5.0|Now Here is Cameron Crowe's best work ever, and considered by many, including myself, to be the best movie that represents 1960's & 70's Rock And Roll. I own the original VHS copy, and have yet to buy the new Bootleg Cut version, which I hear is also something to love. I love the soundtrack, some of the best songs ever and other rarities of Rock and Roll are included.<br />OK now back to the movie, He picked the best actors for the best parts, like Kate Hudson (who actually is married to a rock star) playing the famous band-aid, Penny Lane. Or newcomer Patrick Fugit as William, the struggling 15 Year Old Rolling Stone Journalist. Or Jason Lee (of Jay And Silent Bob Fame) as Jeff Bebe, the Lead Singer of Made-Up Band, Stillwater. Or how about Billy Crudup as Russell Hammond (and is not in anyway related to the organ company famous for the B3), the guitar player and other artistic focus of Stillwater (I heard some rumor that Crowebar officially recruited Brad Pitt to do Russell, but he was busy doing The Mexican with Julia Roberts).<br />Now for a minute I wanna talk about something in the movie which was true masterpiece. In the beginning of the movie when William discovers rock and roll through The Who's Tommy, he plays Sparks first. What Crowebar does in the movie, he mixes the first half of the original Tommy Version with the 2nd Half of the Live At Leeds Version as the scene changes to 1973 from 1969. He should have either put that on the soundtrack album or better yet used Amazing Journey attached to Sparks for the album, because that would keep the mood of the Psychedelia and Rock of Sparks. Either way it would have been great.<br />Anyway, If you are young (like me) or old (doesn't matter) and you are deep into 60's and/or early 70's Rock (Volkswagen Bus and Everything), then you would love this movie! As the chef said, \\"I Guarantee!\\"<br />And on a closing note, this movie actually takes place at the end of the greatest period in American History, The 60's. Most people say that the 60's ended in 1969, but the spirit of freedom, free-love, drugs, and anti-war protest lived on until 1973. So Lester Bangs was actually sort of right, by '73 Rock and Roll was almost over (\\"You Made Just It In Time for the death rattle, last gasp, last grope\\"), but as we all know Rock and Roll never truly died until December 8, 1980, the day John Lennon was assainated. So in one sentences to sum up everything I have said in this review, The 70's were a drag after '73 (why? 1 Word: DISCO!!!!!!!! I HATE DISCO!!!!!!!!!!).Most people say that the 60's ended in 1969, but the spirit of freedom, free-love, drugs, and anti-war protest lived on until 1973.

B00005AXEL|5.0|Well, now I'm fourty, but still remember every new release from Fleetwood Mac with unforgettable Stevie Nicks voice. Listening to her latest record I can find new things, but also somewhere in the background the rumours of old Fleetwood Mac sound. It's a very elegant, mature rock album, in many places probably very personal to the Artist. Listening to it I got a feeling that I was growing up with that sound-it's not the music for teenagers or for the beginners.
B00000064E|4.0|you heard him on the Volkswagon commercial last year, singing &quot;Pink Moon&quot; and now you want to hear more.  Though 'Way to Blue' is an excellent cross section, &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot; is his greatest stand-alone effort.<br />Somber, yet elegant, &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot; shows promise that was tragically cut by Nick's early death, leaving behind a ghostly body of work that is elegant, yet somehow unsettling.  <br />Guitar work on this masterpiece (including the Stonsey backup to &quot;Time Has Told Me&quot;) was done by Richard Thompson.
0440228921|5.0|this is a very good book. it gets good about 1/4 of the way through. i like the ending because it doesn't reveal everything.  <br />                        It was very great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004STPT|5.0|Gladiator is a wonderful movie. It creates a magnificent atmosphere while you watch it. The soundtrack as whole is a beautiful piece of music. My favourite piece is Now we are free. as I heard it is not sung in any real language. But still it must be written somewhere. I wish i coulc get the lyrics from somewhere. So if anyone visiting this page knows the lyrics, please let me know. my add.:  zas260383@poczta.onet.pl
6300214559|5.0|Even if this movie is not 100% historically accurate, it still makes for a great story! From the very beginning this movie had me captivated. The filming is exqusite, the costumes superb, and the story absolutely beautiful. The romance between Jane and Guillford is shown perfectly from their first kiss to the very end when Guillford is sent to his death on Tower Hill. We may never know if their romance was really think this or not, but it's nice to imagine it was. Mary is played absolutly sinisterly and Jane and Guillford are played perfectly. This an excellent movie for anyone who wants to see a beautiful, but doomed romance.
079073639X|1.0|The first 15-20 minutes of the movie was entertaining.  Then it all went to hell.  It seemed to me that Crichten slapped a bunch of random ideas together and made it into what barely passed as a story.  The pacing was awful and sporadic, with little dramatic build-up.  There was hardly any definitive direction, which took a decent concept and flushed it right down the toilet.  All in all, I couldn't recommend this movie to ANYONE.
B000001Y5J|5.0|When I first bought this CD a number of years ago, I hated it. (I purchased it simply because it was a NIN release.) It was abrasive (sonically AND lyrically) but I'd spent hard earned cash on it so playing it just once would make me feel guilty.  The more that I listened to the album the more I liked it. Now the disc rates as one of my all time favorites becuase it has that rare quality of getting better every time that you listen to it. Some time ago, I'd read a review of this album within SPIN where the reviewer labeled this album as &quot;Intriguingly unlistenable&quot;, which is exactly what it is. Buy the disc and find out for yourself...

0783226063|1.0|I saw it a few months back to compare it with the recent \\"Frank Herbert's DUNE\\" miniseries. I was disgusted. More than that I was insulted. This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen (save \\"Mission to Mars\\").<br />It's not like there's just one nagging thing here or there, but THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS SCREWED UP! The acting is atrocious, the screenplay has the feel of a badly written 4th grade book report, the special effects for it's day are a joke (Return of the Jedi came out a year before this with superbly better effects, and Star Trek 3, with great effects for it's time, came out the same year), and the entire feel of the movie is wrong. The Baron Harkonnen is portrayed as a grotesque slob with nothing better to do than laugh and look stupid. Feyd (Sting) is shown as nothing more than a madman wearing a stupid H.R. Giger-esque suit (which is also what the stillsuits looked like. Yeah, really smart to wear all-black suits in the scorching deserts of Arrakis). Thufir Howat looks like a comatosed Dr. Who reject. Stilgar looks like a caveman......all the characters were portrayed like clowns or comic book characters! It's like Lynch ripped out every 20th page of the book, slapped it together, and made a script out of it. Oh yes, the script......... film students have failed courses and been kicked out of their colleges for writing scripts better than this. The music was good until they added that 80s pop crap to it. Shai-Hulud, the great sandworm of Arrakis, looked like a sock puppet.  The ornithopters looked like magical flying cardboard boxes. The Spacing Guild Liner looked like a drawing cutout and literally faded into the space above Arrakis (the Romulan ships in Star Trek had an excuse for using such a simplistic effect, it was 1967. This was made in 1984). Alia, Paul's little sister, looked and sounded more like she was possessed by something out of Martha Stewart's nightmares than a child with a Reverend Mother's powers. Important characters like Fenring, Otheym, Jamis, and even the fact that Paul and Chani had a son who was killed in a Sardukar raid, were completely left out of the movie. And the thing with hearing the thoughts? AAAH! BAD LYNCH! BAD! NO SEQUEL RIGHTS FOR YOU!   I seriously have to question the sanity and taste of the people who praised this film. Don't waste your money on this DVD or the VHS version. Heck, don't waste $... to rent it either, or the two hours to watch it. It's just not worth it. Few movies make me actually mad when I finish watching them. This one did.  The miniseries was leaps and bounds better than this empty shell of a story that Lynch tried to call a movie....
B00000I1OZ|5.0|One of the best things about this movie was the beautiful setting. It was filmed in Venice, and there were some seriously magnificent shots. It made me wish I could just pick up and go there for a weekend, like Faith and Kate did.<br />The movie begins with Faith as a girl, playing with a Ouiji board. She asks who her soulmate is, and it gives her the name Damon Bradley. All her life, she waits to find him, but is unsuccessful. Marisa Tomei does an excellent job portraying the naive dreamer, Faith. When a phone call turns out to be a lead on discovering her soulmate, Faith and Kate fly to Venice, hoping to find him...ten days before Faith is supposed to marry the wrong man. In Venice, Faith runs into Peter Wright *literally* who chases her down to return her shoe. The moment she bumps into him, he falls in love with her! Seeing it as his only opportunity to get to know her, Peter (played by Robert Downey Jr.) pretends to be Damon.<br />I won't spoil the ending, but I will say this movie really made me smile. It's a great chick flick for those of us who love romance movies.
0452282152|4.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring is a very interesting book about a slice of life during the 17th-century. It is a fictional account of Griet, a domestic servant and potential subject in Vermeer's painting of the same name. Not much is known about Vermeer or his domestic subjects. During the Dutch Golden Age, painting was not considered an art, but a craftsmanship, a way to make a living. Vermeer is considered one of the masters in the Delft painters' guild and it was quite an honor to serve this master. This book takes you back in time as you experience the way of life in the 1660's.  You will get your hands dirty with Griet as she boils the water for endless loads of laundry, selects the best cuts of meat at the market and as she mixes the paints that Vermeer will use in bringing life to his domestic interiors, portraits and city views. In the actual painting, the subject has a gaze is alert and keen, her lips are parted and she seems about to speak. This would aptly describe Griet as she has a good eye for art and somewhat of a risk taker in stating her opinions.
B00000I07P|5.0|As one of the first albums I bought in high school, &quot;Slippery&quot; will always bring back the foggy memories of grades ten through 12.  This is the album that I plug into the stereo when I get heartily sick of the cloying, saccharine, eunuch-bands' tripe or the angst-ridden pseudo-political statements of the '90s.  The '80s were decadent and celebrated it, and Bon Jovi epitomized this with their introduction of metal to the mainstream.  Contrast with the equally-decadent '90s, where although we're arguably living in a more peaceful, prosperous world, our music attempts to make us madder 'n hell and unwilling to take it no more.  Bon Jovi's honesty is refreshing in my speakers!
0141000198|5.0|I loved this book. Finally a character who is real and I can relate too. I'm buying this for all my girl-friends this year for birthday presents. Plus the parallel to PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is hysterical fun. LOVED IT!
0440219078|5.0|When I picked up &quot;The Giver&quot;, I couldn't put it down.  In a strange way it almost relates to the society today.  It's a really great book for kids in grades 6-7, but I recommend this book to anyone who has a good imagination.
B000002B35|5.0|At first, I payed no attention to this boxed set when I first noticed it at the CD store. I am a Floyd fan from way back in the early years and I thought that this was just more re-packaged classics. I WAS WRONG! This album is truly moving. they play thier hearts out and trust me, you will not even miss Roger Waters. Deserving special mention is High Hopes. This was the last song on thier last album (The Division Bell). The trademark sprawling instrumental at the end will bring tears to your eyes! Vintage Pink Floyd.
0440219078|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read! It's like a strange dream you can't get out of.  It would be a great book for grades 6-7.  Once you pick up &quot;The Giver&quot;, you wont want to put it down.  In some ironic way, it can very easily relate to society today.  I would reccomend &quot;The Giver&quot; to anyone.
B00003CX8J|3.0|I wrote this line because the X-Men are the future of good comic book adaptations. Yes Spider-Man is coming, but i'm not seeing Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, and Kristen Dunst is just not red haired.  The X-Men is not a Batman (for me the best adaptation yet), but is really entertaining: Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen ARE perfect on their roles, the other actors are good but they don't have comparsion with them.  Good FXs , good plot but with some minor holes (is not a big deal), and it's simply good to see the X-Men on action in the big screen. 6 out of 10, 3 stars out of five.
B000000WFF|5.0|On the good times.<br />I know I'm late writing this review, but honestly, I haven't even listened to this CD in years.  Then one night I put it and and was reminded why I bought it in the first place.  After I first heard \\"Never Give Up on the Good Times,\\" I tracked that song down... Since I'm a big fan of funk and disco and grooves, and well..things I can just shake my booty to, this song is a winner.  I like the retro feel it delivers, and while I hardly ever listen to the OTHER songs on the CD, I will listen to \\"Never Give Up...\\" over and over, so for that song alone I give it a solid five.
B00000JGEI|4.0|Completely different from the first film. James Cameron goes a lot beyond his first attempt. He plays a dramatic twist and trick on everyone by making the « terminator » (or rather its sibling) of the first film the protector of John who is now born and kicking. But another terminator has been sent, entirely made of a special metal that makes him able to take any form he wants. The first thing achieved by the good one is to save John from the bad one. Then He saves the mother who is in a carceral psychiatric hospital. Then he prepares the attack against the bad one. But here James Cameron goes beyond this surface. The good terminator becomes a good father substitute for John. He learns human emotions, even if he will never cry, and he also learns human feelings and motivations and he will help in changing the future completely by destroying the research that would produce the thinking machines and the terminators. Then he deals with the bad terminator and manages to get him molten in a tank of metal in fusion, then to destroy the chip and arm that had already been produced by a research worker and a computer firms that had been destroyed in the meantime, and finally to go beyond his mission and all human feelings and destroy the second existing chip that would produce the machine-dominated future by destroying or having himseld destroyed in the metal in fusion. There is thus some hope that the future could change. Here James Cameron is really optimistic : the human race can use machines to transcend the future and the past to change the past in order to have a better future. He just forgets that if one man has invented this chip, it is someting possible in the human society at a certain moment of its development, and hence at least one other man, if not two or three are on the same line of research and will get to the same results, but not in the US this time, or maybe in the US after all, why not. There is no escape from the future of humanity, no matter how dark it may look, and there is A FATE in this historical perspective, even if this fate might accept some variations. But the general line survives and will always come to life. This would have given a pessimistic twist to the story and this was avoided by James Cameron. That is just what people like Stephen King, or some other science fiction writers avoid : Doomsday is necessarily down the road, a man-made artificial doomsday that has little to do with the Apocalypse but that means the end of humanity anyway, and maybe some resistance that will maybe be successful, at least for a time. A great action film though. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.t may look, and there is A FATE in this historical perspective, even if this fate might accept some variations.

038533348X|5.0|This novel surpassed my expectations by far. I was expecting your normal hero novel, good vs. bad. This was not the case once so ever. It was a masterpiece narrating the journey the family of Alfred Hoeniker, pioneer of the Atom bomb. Obviously, this wasn't based on any true story, but was so amazing and really makes you consider everything you have ever believed in. I recommend this novel with passion.
B00000JGEH|4.0|James Cameron in this first film envisages the future of the Human Race in Los Angeles in 2029, after the first nuclear war that was started by intelligent machines produced by men at the end of the 1990s. Those machines took over the whole decision process and decided to get rid of the human race through a nuclear war that they started by attacking the Russians. Some resistance exists because a small minority of human beings survived, because the machines  need them as slaves. So an underground army appeared and is ruthlessly chased by the machines. The leader is a certain John Connor. But machines decides to use a brand new time-travel machine to get back in the past and change the future by destroying the mother of that John before he was ever born. The resistance sends one of them to protect her and destroy the « terminator » who is supposed to do the dirty job. The soldier that is sent will succeed in his mission and destroy the Terminator before he fulfills his mission, but he will also fall in love with Sally Connor and become john's father. There is here a contradiction because this soldier has flash-forwards and he sees himself as a soldier admiring a picture of Sally, how can he has taken this picture to the future if he had to come back to the past to impregnate Sally with John, knowing that he will not be able to go back to the future. But the action is tight and this « detail » is not too visible. The film shows how the human race can resist, though they can't do more, against the dictatorshop of machines. It is in a way optimistic. But not so much because this does not change the future, but only guarantees that a leader will exist for this resistance in the future.

B00004XPP0|5.0|A superb Star Wars trilogy, with enhancements to the stereo and picture quality. It makes it seem like it was made in the 1990s, instead of the '70s and '80s. A superb movie trilogy packed into a collector set, with excellent characters (Skywalker, Vader, Solo, and Leia) and nonstop special effects. Cool bonus footage. George Lucas has created three equally good cinematic masterpieces. All three videos are rated PG; usually for some minor profanity and action violence.

B000059ZLH|5.0|From what may just be the best band on the planet, comes not only a terrific show, but a truly 5-Star quality recording with a lot of pretty cool extras! If your a Dream Theatre fan and have a DVD player, buy this now! If your a Dream Theatre fan and dont have a DVD player, this would be the best reason you'll ever have to own one. If your not a Dream Theatre fan your not familiar with Mike Portnoy, John Petrucci, Jordan Rudess, John Myung and James LaBrie. All I can say is &quot;WAKE UP!&quot; Metropolis 2000 is an impeccable production with terrific sound and video quality that will delight all of your musical senses! Forget those bozo's that reviewed this and claimed dissapointment with the 'screen panning' or the 'Dolby v.2', I assure you that you will watch this so many times you'll wear it out! There is absolutley 'nothing' wrong with this DVD recording!!!! The extras include the full concert (again) with the sound turned down and a strategically panned band humerously commenting on each other's work throughout the show. It's absolutely hysterical! The DVD also includes a tour slide show, a half a dozen other Dream Theatre songs, lenghty Band and Crew introductions with highlights, and much more. The Video is the entire Album Metropolis 2000 - Scenes from a Memory and the Camera Work and Sound Recording quality is almost better than being there. I was at the Boston show and was absolutely blown away. I never thought they can top this work, but by capturing the show as well as they did on this DVD, they certainly proved me wrong!<br />If there were 10 stars, I would give this a 9+ .............................BUY IT NOW!

6305358613|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece of historical FICTION.  Do not go in expecting to see a perfectly accurate documentary when you watch this, because if you do, you will be sorely disappointed.  Granted, this is based on real events, but they did not necessarily occur in the order this movie suggests.  If this movie were completely accurate, it would be very boring and unappealing to viewers except for a few not too exciting people.  <br />Instead, watch this movie ready to be moved.  It is a fabulous illustration of the power, majesty, wit and political abilities of Britain's most powerful and famous Queen.  Elizabeth combines sex, violence, betrayal and intrigue, while presenting it in a deep and meaningful way.  <br />In the beginning of the movie we see the young and innocent Princess Elizabeth in constant danger while her catholic sister rules.  Protestant attempts to place Elizabeth on the throne put Elizabeth in great danger.  When Mary dies of cancer, Elizabeth takes the throne in a catholic male dominated society and must overcome plots and intrigues just to stay alive.  <br />Cate Blanchett delivers a spectacular performance as Elizabeth, portraying her caring sensitivity at the same time as her cold and ironic wit.  Her evolution throughout the movie is spectacular, and this performance far outshone Gwenyth Paltrow's in the cliché movie that beat this one out for the presigious oscars.  Joseph Fiennes plays Robert Dudley, the Queen's love interest, and plays the part well, but comes off as a somewhat two-dimensional character.  Other notable performances are by Fannny Ardent as the venomous queen of Scotland and Richard Attenborough as William Cecil, Elizabeth's advisor.  <br />Historical discrepancies aside, this movie is an amazing and powerful portrayal of the raw majesty that was Queen Elizabeth.  In my opinion is was just slightly too dark for the academy's liking, and that cost them the best picture.

B00002MZ4V|1.0|I used to like Mr. Williams. His majestic score in Star Wars Trilogy simply blew me away. However, after twenty minutes of listening to this album, the only thing in my mind was pushing the stop the button. When you are listening to Superman, if you tell other people this is Star Wars, they might be convinced. Mr. Williams uses the same kind of music almost everytime and I got sick, sick of those loud, clamorous, annoying wind instruments which are much more disturbing than rap or rock music. To sum up, if you like Mr. Williams, don't buy this one.
0679721037|5.0|The Saturday Review of Books claimed that anyone who is able to read should read this book. I wholeheartedly agree.   The city of Hiroshima was destroyed by the first atomic bomb on April 6, 1945. This book begins on that day, detailing the terrible destruction and the hardships that fell on the citizens of the city.<br />The book follows the lives of several survivors-a doctor, a housewife, and a German priest among others-as they struggle through the ruins of their homes and the lingering effects the radiation had on their lives for decades afterwards.<br />Hiroshima is a testament to humanity and its will to survive, to move on, and try desperately to not repeat the tragedies of the past. Appropriately, Hiroshima points no fingers of blame, but instead shows the best humanity has to offer in the face of unspeakable horror.

B00003Q43A|3.0|Although it doesn't stand up to much scrutiny, such as why do alien ships that large need weapons when they can use their own gravity to cause tidal waves? They could have conquered the Earth merely by moving a little bit.<br />It is easier to accept that flaw when considering our heroes are Will Smith, Harry Connick, Jr., Jeff Goblum, and Harvey Firestein.<br />The special effects and the feel good message of a united mankind make the movie a fun way to kill an evening with a group of friends. You can all cheer loudly when the classic scene of the White House getting blasted shows up on screen.
0553108034|5.0|I have never been involved in delirious medieval battle, sword in hand, cutting down my nearest foes. My hands and arms have never felt warm blood spurting from inflicted wounds.

I am half a man and drunk with slaughter, let them kill me if they can!\\"<br />Thus reads an excerpt from A CLASH OF KINGS, the mind-blowing sequel to A GAME OF THRONES. George RR Martin's seducing darkness of the bleak and torn Seven Kingdoms continues as we are presented with old and new characters in this startling but sinister tale of A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE. Queen Cersei's son Joffrey ascends to the Iron Throne and continues with his sadistic reign of the King's Landing in the south following the death of King Robert.  The grim Stannis and Renly Baratheon (brothers to Robert) believe themselves to be the legitimate heirs to the throne. This is the prequel and culminates to the final epic battle against Joffrey and the Lannisters.  Stannis relies on the powers of his new faith inthe God of Light and Lady Melissandre, yet not everything is what it seems, and darker powers seem to be at work in Stannis. Renly, in turn, relies solely on his charisma to draw and lead a vast army.<br />Rob Stark still battles to avenge his father's execution. Daenerys, the exiled heir of the former ruling family, continues the nurture of her three dragons. Jon, now part of the Nightwatch, travels further north to destroy the Wildlings and its leader, and hopes to destroy the evil threatens the Kingdom, now that the dead seem to walk.<br />My favourite character is Tyrion Lannister, an evil but likeable character, who tries to tame his nephew, King Joffrey, and protect himself from the evil schemes of his sister, Queen Cersei. <br />Martin captures the horror of medieval battles, where survival was not only based on skill, but also on luck. There is nothing sweet, nothing heroic, but Martin leaves you tasting the blood and witnessing the gore of the battle between steel and flesh. The reader is not untouched by this, but is seduced by the pain and terror of these characters. The story is definitely graphic and aimed at the adult reader.   Martin is a superb storyteller (the best I have come across) and he infuses his characters with life, purpose and a sense of chaotic morality. The characters move between shades of grey, and are not strictly saints or sinners, but each is fallible in his or her beliefs. This is what makes the story so gripping and interesting. Be prepared for a roller coaster ride gone out of control. You never know what happens next, and it is hard to guess where Martin is going with this tale.<br />In A CLASH OF KINGS evil outwits good, if goodness can be found. Martin succeeds in disguising darkness as light, as it slays those who are deceived by it. The introduction of magic in this book is very subtle, but utterly believable.<br />The only complaint I have about this book, is that Martin is slow to reveal the grandness of the story, and I guess we will have to wait for A DANCE WITH DRAGONS.
B00001PE4D|4.0|Cruel Intentions is Dangerous Liasons in prep school, but that fact is largely forgotten considering the emphasis on a youthful fantasy of being young, pretty, and wealthy.<br />It is easy to forget the plot when you get to ogle Sarah Michelle Gellar and Reese Witherspoon for ninety minutes. I suppose girls feel the same way about Ryan Phillippe, no?<br />The convoluted plot contains revenge on ex-lovers, the corruption of the pure, and the redemption of the evil. One never expects until the last few minutes of the movie exactly who is who from that last sentence.<br />I suppose I wouldn't be a guy if I didn't mention that the scene where Reese Witherspoon slinks out of the swiiming pool in a soaking wet bathing suit is worth the price of admission alone.

0385312083|5.0|There is little really to be said about this wonderful novel (Vonnegut's one true masterpiece, though &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; and &quot;Mother Night&quot; are great too)--not that I'd need much to say anyway.  Vonnegut's quirkiness, wit, and humanity are honed to perfect pitch in this story of the complacent Billy Pilgrim's random and unhinged journey through time, from the firebombing of Dresden in 1945 (&quot;I was there too.  Me.  The author of this book.&quot;) to his life as an optometrist in Ilium, NY (that is, Schenectady) in the 1960's.  <br />But why should I say anything?  This is a unique novel, a great, moving read, &amp; a quick one too--you can read it in one sitting if you want to (I think I did it in 2 or 3 over one weekend).  You have little to lose and everyting to gain.
6301247485|4.0|I agree with most of the reviews.  This was a great movie, with Robert Redford doing his best.  Mia Farrow, well, they could have picked a better actress for that role.  Bruce Dern was great and so was Sam Waterson.  I sure wish they kept the original Nelson Riddle Soundtrack in the newer VHS/DVD recording.  I liked the original that was in the '74 movie, and not the boring one included in the newer video.  Why in the world would they do that, can anyone explain that to me?  Nelson Riddle got an award for the music too, and yet they nixed it.  I would love to hear &quot;Charlston&quot; or &quot;What'll I Do&quot;, etc., again in this film.  PLEASE, PLEASE put back the original soundtrack when making a video tape/DVD of this 1974 movie!!!
0345404475|5.0|Though much science fiction of yesteryear is now dated and reads blandly, SF visionary Philip K. Dick was well ahead of his time and his best works, including this masterpiece, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? This book works on two levels. On the one hand, it is an exciting, fast-paced, and highly entertaining SF action adventure. This facet of the novel was, of course, captured in the movie Blade Runner. However, it also has a deeper, below the surface, entirely different meaning to it. In this book, Dick asks us what it means to be human. If you read this book and dig below the surface to the core themes, you may find that the answer may be a lot different than you think. Whatever level you take the book on, it is a masterpiece-enjoyable, entertaining, and yet literary and profound. Even the seemingly wacky title is perfect. Read.
B00000AFFF|5.0|Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach have combined forces to make a truly brilliant album. Like all good music, this gets better with each listen: subtle melodies come to the surface; lyrical nuances eventuate; beautiful musical riffs come out of hiding. There is just enough Elvis Costello in this not to lose it's pop/rock flavour, and just enough Burt Bacharach for it not to lose it's easy listening, romantic lounge feel. The history behind these men speaks for itself: Bacharach is something of a god when it comes to creating mellow moods and Costello is revered amongst his fans as the king of pop-rock. Both are equally hailed as being song-writing geniuses. Painted From Memory combines their musical virtuosity and the result is breathtaking - this surely is one of the best albums of the 1990's. <br />Upon first listening, Painted From Memory may seem a bit routine: a bit too Englebert Humperdinck. However, like good literature, upon each revisitation it gets better and better. Costello's trademark strong, albeit slightly querulous vocals merge with the smooth piano of Bacharach to create 12 beautiful songs, each more varied than the last. There are the haunting melodies of the sinister, yet strangely romantic `In the Darkest Place'; the ruminations of `Tears at the Birthday Party'; the mellow and very Bacharach `Toledo'; and the restrained anger towards a serial adulterer in `What's Her Name Today?' The album finishes with the piece-de-resistance: the Grammy nominated `God Give Me Strength' - this song evokes real emotion in the listener and is the triumph of the album. <br />Fans of Costello will be more taken aback by this album than fans of Bacharach. Costello has long established himself as a rock statesman thanks to the rhythmic, heavy beats of his early albums such as `This Year's Model', `Blood and Chocolate' and `Armed Forces'. However, during the eighties he became more experimental and more restrained: this period in his career saw triumphs like `Spike', `Trust' and the brilliant `King of America'. The nineties has seen the performer really expand his horizons in `The Juliet Letters' and `All This Useless Beauty', where he performed with The Attractions, his long-time supporting band. And now, in `Painted From Memory', Costello has really matured. This is not a bad thing; rather, judging by the quality of the album, it's an excellent thing. Costello is a songwriter who has changed over time and for that all of his fans should embrace him - `Painted From Memory' really shows off his musical virtuosity. This album not only showcases two musical geniuses, but also marks something of the complete evolution of Costello - he, like Tom Waits, Lou Reed and David Bowie, has matured, and so has his music. It is as good, if not better, than it used to be. For this reason, `Painted From Memory' should be on every Costello fans' CD rack, and is essential listening for any die-hard Bacharach fan. It truly is a brilliant album.
B000UBMSB8|1.0|I have been waiting for years for the original version of this movie to be released and finally it has.  I prefer original cuts of movies to the do-over versions.  Unfortunately Mr. Scott has screwed this up.  The four disc version gives you his so called \\"Final Cut\\", Pink Floyd might want to talk to him about that title.  The behind the scenes gets its' own disc, the extra footage and effects gets its' own disc, \\"The Final Cut\\" gets its' own disc.  Here is where the problem comes in, the original version from 1982, the international version also from 1982, and the director's cut from 1992 are all squeezed onto one disc.  That is probably why it constantly freezes up when I try to play it.  All I wanted was the original 1982 version but Mr. Scott's ego forces us to buy either this set or the newer 5 disc set which includes a rough cut of the movie.  This is the only way to get the original version.  I will probably watch the other discs once then never again, how many times do you need to see the behind the scenes stuff.  Either way I feel I still don't have what I want because I am sure this freezing up problem is a disc problem and not a DVD player problem.  On this disc, disc #3, all versions have freezing problems on the same scenes.  Even though the price is priced for a single DVD why can't these directors stop being ball breakers and release single versions?  Mr. Scott does an intro for these films and when he talks about the 1982 theatrical version you get the feeling from his tone that it is here it is now choke on it.  You get the impression that he hates the movie and he will grudgingly, give you barbarians it crammed onto a disc with the other two films.  Why doesn't Warner Brothers take back control over their property?  I have enjoyed many of Mr. Scott's movies but what he is doing to the 1982 theatrical version is a shame.  I am glad I got Alien before he decides to screw with that classic.  I guess in a few years he will re-re-re-release another set of Blade Runner movies.  I should send him back my copy of the 4 disc set and demand my refund from him and not Amazon.of Blade Runner movies.

B00005B6C9|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD!  I was a lukewarm Bee Gees fan until I heard this album.  It is a very personal album for the Bee Gees, and it truly shines because this talented trio is unafraid to explore and show their talent. They are not bound by any stylistic mold or musical style.  Each song is completely unique.  The title song is very catchy and shows off Robin's powerful vocals.  I also love Wedding Day, Walking on Air, and Embrace.  Robin simply shines in this album, and Maurice does pretty well in Man in the Middle.  Buy it!
0385495323|5.0|Reading a book about cryptography over a weekend that was relegated to the recycle bin thanks to an annoying bout of flu was not something I expect to dream about, leave alone end up actually doing. Well, read that book I did. And how. Friday night through Tuesday morning I looked like a law student cramming for a bar exam, except I was enjoying every moment of it.<br />Rhetoric apart, The Code Book, a well-written chronology of cryptology, is one more of those excellent near-fiction but non-fiction reads on the market today. Simon Singh's alternative profession as a PBS documentarian is betrayed as the book unfolds almost like a televised series on the evolution of cryptography and cryptanalysis. Singh unearths some intriguing stories involving the Queen of Scots, World War II, Hitler, Navajo Indians, and asymmetric key cryptography. The intriguing but heavy social aspect of cryptography is clearly surfaced and is something that is bound to keep the reader thinking about.<br />In summary, this is a reasonably easy read aimed at the average inquisitive reader but there are enough technical details to keep the &quot;power readers&quot; satisfied. <br />In one line: a highly recommended read for anyone who can hold up a book and turn pages.
B00003CXQY|5.0|I am a major anti-Disney consumer.  With the exception of Alladin and the Lion King, I literally HATE Disney films.  Now I have a third exception to add to my list of great exceptions.  The Emperor's New Groove is just A LOT of fun and given the fact I purchased the two disc set I am very pleased to say the DVD is outstanding!  I have to respond to a comment one of the previous reviewers shared about widescreen and full screen formats and why they are not available for most DVD's.  In time, TV's are going to radically change.  Although VHS technology is still being used, it's definitely on it's way out the door with the ever-advancing technology to allow people to &quot;burn&quot; their own CD's and eventually DVD's.  Full screen format is considered in the technical age, well, ANCIENT!  It's a very old-style of viewing that has long been asked to leave the room.  However, most people have not taken to the wide screen format in America like they have in Europe and Asia.  You go to any other country, you will see the wide screen format of TV's being used and it's very commonplace.  America just takes forever to catch on to the technology and to bring the price of this technology down to levels where &quot;everyone&quot; can purchase it.  If you love full screen format, don't buy a DVD player since most DVD's will be released only in widescreen format until you can afford a widescreen TV or deal with the black bars on the top and bottom of your screen.  This technology isn't going away-don't beat em, join em!
B000002J1H|5.0|Until recently, Yes had always been my favorite progressive rock band. They've had their ups and downs, but when they were good, wow...they were really something. Going For The One was the band's final moment of greatness, serving as a coda for their prosperous epoch of the 1970s, which began with The Yes Album several years before. After this record, Yes never did anything as consistent or interesting.<br />I never liked any of Yes' work as much as Close to the Edge, but Going For The One just might be my second favorite. For the first time since Fragile, we get songs under ten minutes, and the band again shows they don't have to put together a colossal epic to write great music. The title track has a killer vocal hook and Steve Howe playing a C&amp;W-esque riff on steel guitar (I don't think many other prog rockers used that thing). &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; is a wonderful, elegant ballad as only Jon Anderson can do them.<br />It's clear that Rick Wakeman (who's back on this album) likes the organ. There's a lot of it on this album, and it was recorded at St. Martin's Church in Switzerland. You wouldn't think an hulking organ - generally ascribed to moments of beauty and majesty - could be a rock n' roll instrument, but Wakeman turns it into one. Just listen to &quot;Parallels.&quot; It's definitely unconventional, which is part of what makes it so interesting.<br />The 15-minute &quot;Awaken&quot; is one of the band's best epics, and that's no mean feat, because they have a lot of great ones. After the opening piano segment, it goes into the usual Yes characteristics: many layers of synths, guitars and bass playing out complex melodies in a pseudo-orchestral fashion. Anderson's lyrics are strange as always, but the diction is delightfully spiritual, and his radiant singing - love it or hate it - is critical for this evocative and spacey song. The ambient middle instrumental section before the &quot;Master of...&quot; lines is one of Yes' most sublime moments. Anderson's busts out the harp for some appreciated flourishes that add considerably to the atmosphere and magic of the song.<br />The original recording's production sometimes had problems balancing the vocals and the instruments. There were frustrating moments when it was hard to make out what Anderson was singing if you didn't already know the lyrics. So, the remastered edition is a good bet.nts.

B00005ASOC|3.0|Unlike Good Will Hunting, I was unable to be involved with Finding Forrester.  I couldn't &quot;feel&quot; anything from the Jamal character.  Yes, he did a fine job for a first-time actor, but he didn't seem to &quot;be&quot; the character he was portraying - perhaps this was because it was his first effort.  Nevertheless, his blandness throughout the film made it seem overly long.  And the plot had already been used by Director Van Sant - and it wasn't an improvement on Good Will Hunting - it wasn't even a remake - it was just . . .  less than. The saving grace of the film was Sean Connery.  No matter what the man acts in he seems to be in character.
B000001ES9|5.0|Rush's first recording isn't a Rush album, per se.<br />Before Neil Peart joined, before Rush gained notoriety as a respectable progressive rock band, they were a becoming Led Zeppelin-esque band that rocked hard. And they rocked hard well. Former drummer John Rutsey was no Peart, but it doesn't matter. This is rock n' roll, with no trace of the progressive ambition the band would later embrace with Peart's vision.<br />So what does it offer? Sleek guitar licks, melodic and lyrical hooks, and energetic arrangements and performances. Some of the lyrics are embarrassingly banal at times, and in many ways the album is disappointingly straightforward, but what the album lacks in instrumental pyrotechnics and progressive factors, it makes up for it with the infectious exuberance of a band's first album. Even at this first step of their career, the band shows high spirits and a good knack for songwriting.<br />The band would quickly change for the better with the departure of Rutsey and the arrival of Peart. Although many dismiss this album as the forgettable debut, I can't help but be amused by its simple charm. It does nothing to show how they were destined for greatness, but the music is good. Isn't that what matters?
B000056N8X|2.0|Highlander was a wonderful film. What other movie makes you hope that some day an insane Russian berserker will come and stick a broadsword through your stomach so that just maybe you too can live forever. (Ok, maybe I was just a weird kid). <br />The thing with Hollywood is, there are executives out there who see a successful film and then think &quot;I bet people would love to see a sequel!&quot; I can see following this flawed logic once, but three times? The Highlander sequels are so bad that each refuses to acknowledge the existence of its predecessors. <br />Highlander: Endgame is the latest in this series. I was kind of weary of going to see this film from the first commercial, because the trailer appears to give away the entire plot. That's right, the trailer basically consists of Conner and Duncan sitting near a magical portal discussing the plot of the movie and giving away the climax. I'm not going to say it here, because I don't want to &quot;ruin the surprise&quot; but if you do decide to rent the film, please be very careful not to read the front cover, because there are major plot spoilers right there on the box. Anyway, what's worse is the scene from the trailer isn't even in the film. Someone in the Buena Vista/Mirimax/Mandalay brain trust actually decided that the movie wasn't exciting enough to make a commercial so they filmed a special commercial unrelated to the rest of the movie with the sole exception of ruining the film for anyone (like myself) who might be foolish enough to watch it. <br />What does this film accomplish? Well, speaking as a guy, co-starlet Lisa Barbuscia is extremely easy on the eyes. And since &quot;Highlander&quot; is actually pig-latin for &quot;testosterone fest&quot; we have thrown in a sometimes bare-chested Adrian Paul for the ladies. The film has a decent one-liner here or there that managed to make me laugh, and there was at least some attempt to connect the film to the first Highlander as well as the television series. (Films 2 and 3 are completely ignored). The set and costumes are pretty. Not a masterpiece worthy of academy awards, but they are nice to look at. <br />Where does the film fail? Well, for starters, the ending is immediately obvious the second you pick up the box. The special effects are somewhat mediocre even for a television show (exactly where did that $15million budget go?). The story is less than engaging. Despite numerous cutaway scenes to remind us that this is a sequel to both the first film and the TV show, the film conveniently ignores the entire second half of the first movie! Finally, Adrian Paul shows the emotional range of... well... Adrian Paul. <br />I can't see recommending this to anyone who isn't a hardcore Highlander fan (and if you are, you've probably already seen it, and nothing I can say will matter). If you're a casual fan, you can probably let this one go by. I wish I could give a film a rating of 1.5. I can't see my way fit to giving it a 1, because it did have some redeeming qualities, and most importantly, no one ever uttered the words &quot;Planet Zeist.&quot;
6301768809|5.0|The two roles Sylvester Stallone is most well-known for are Rocky and Rambo. Comedians used to have a field day pointing out that the two characters are virtually the same the reason being that Sly can't act so he only plays characters that are just like him: muscle-bound men with little intelligence, a good heart, and ambitions of rising above their current situation. There are many similarities between the two characters but there are many differences as well. The careful observer notices those differences and realizes that Sly is a much more talented artist than most people will give him credit for.<br />Nowhere is this more clear than in FIRST BLOOD. When most people think of Rambo they have an image of Sly with a red headband firing a M-16, blowing people away in a jungle somewhere. This is not the John Rambo of FIRST BLOOD (well at least not until the last twenty-five minutes of the movie). The John Rambo of FIRST BLOOD is a discouraged Vietnam veteran walking across the country trying to locate the only other surviving buddy of his from Vietnam. He soon discovers that his friend has died from cancer caused by Agent Orange. With no family, no friends, a government who has abandoned him, and a nation that scorns him, John Rambo becomes a lonely drifter. No big deal, except he drifts into a town that isn't very hospitable to strangers. The local sheriff literally drives Rambo away, but arrests him after he comes back. What the local law enforcement doesn't realize is that Rambo is a ticking time-bomb; a killing machine prone to war flashbacks. What follows is a great acion-filled hunt between Rambo and a timid sheriff and his local yokels set in the beautiful American northwest.<br />FIRST BLOOD is a great movie. It suffers from a few flaws typical of the 1980's action genre (invincible men who only suffer from the occasional deep wound). However, it is also a film exploring a part of American society (now virually history) that many would rather forget. Though there aren't as many abuses to Vietnam veterans as there used to be and many sins have been attoned for, there is still a great deal of prejudice in our country. That prejudice is just a fraction of the ever-dividing culture war that is ripping the United States apart. FIRST BLOOD and John Rambo are a testament of what can happen if the elite continue to ignore the common man and push him too far.there aren't as many abuses to Vietnam veterans as there used to be and many sins have been attoned for, there is still a great deal of prejudice in our country.

B00005B6C9|5.0|Amazing!  This album has a lot of great songs that recall the Bee Gees' old R&amp;B roots, as well as a lot of great new stuff.  There are a couple of songs written by and featuring each brother, and several joint efforts, which means there are lots of different sounds on this album.  <br />There are two unbelievable songs by Maurice: &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; and &quot;Walking on Air.&quot;  One of Barry's tracks, &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot; sounds like a 1920's jazz soundie.  I think the title track, &quot;This is Where I Came In&quot; might be my new favorite Bee Gees song.<br />This is the best Bee Gees album in years.  I can't recommend it enough!
0780625129|5.0|I rarely buy movies. But I did buy American History X.<br />This is the incredibly powerful story of two brothers who fall into the trap of racism and hate. It is also the story of these brothers trying to free themselves from racism and hate. After spending some time in prison for murdering two blacks who try and steal his car (a dispute starting with a basketball game), former neo-nazi Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) leaves his incarceration a changed man. To his dismay, however, he find that his younger brother is walking the same path he once did. The movie uses black-and-white scenes from the past in conjunction with color scenes in the current situation to establish Derek's sordid history as a vicious racist and show his path to change.<br />The younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), idolizes Derek. In fact, the local coterie of skinheads all do. Derek has a power to feed the hate of his retinue with fiery rhetoric that targets ethnic groups indiscriminately with intense indignation. The movie is truly scary when you see the skinheads bonding, brought together by an irrational hate and Derek's ability to gratify it with his fierce oratories.<br />Edward Norton was robbed when the Academy denied him the Oscar for Best Actor (he was nominated, though). His performance is compelling and real...frighteningly so. He effectively straddles the line between a smart kid with dumb ideas and the true racist seething with hate. I sincerely think he is one of Hollywood's most promising actors. Edward Furlong is also powerful, which is shocking for an actor of his age. Danny shares Derek's hate, but not the ability to convey it &quot;rationally.&quot; The script is stunning, likewise the directing and editing.<br />The movie is violent and brutal, almost disturbingly so, but it is critical to underscore the power of the story. This is not tasteless killing. And it does not glorify racism...it exposes the consequences of racism and its absurdity. It shows how screwed-up people can rise above the pettiness of hate. One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is when Derek and Danny pull down all the Nazi crap on his bedroom wall.<br />This movie is intense, as well. I must have lost 20 pounds watching it, because my heart was pounding insanely hard. The ending is horrifyingly sad...I have to wonder if I've ever been more moved by a movie.<br />Be warned: It's brutal, gritty, and emotionally heavy. But at the same time it's a remarkably powerful story with first-rate acting and a powerful message. Don't pass this one up.le can rise above the pettiness of hate.

0694013889|4.0|To those of you who complained about the dated drawings: the book is from the 70s. That's why the illustrations look like...they're from the 70s. To those of you who feel the potty doesn't look enough like a potty: get one of your own and show it to your kid. Who do you think has more influence, you or a book? Can't your child differentiate between two different articles of clothing and still know that they are both meant to be worn? Please remember, a book is never meant to replace a parent. It is a tool for you to use to your best advantage. I wish the book showed the baby pulling down her pants, but I know that I can pass that along to my baby all by myself!
0671027344|4.0|In the novel, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Stephen Chbosky uses many different techniques to characterize teenager's struggles.  The novel is based on one boy's difficulties in life and how he, Charlie, deals with each encounter.  In order for Charlie to get through these times, he writes letters to an anonymous \\"friend\\", whom he never reveals the name of.  Charlie is a freshman in high school, who is trying to find his place in life.  He has to deal with the struggles of any teenager; love, relationships, drugs, alcohol, and family trouble.  In the end, he is able to overcome all and find out his purpose in life.   Chbosky uses many different literary techniques in his writings.  One such technique is his use of symbols.  He uses issues that impact many teens, including drugs, sex, and alcohol, to depict the true essence of today's world.  Chbosky also uses a journalistic style of writing.  Through this format, one is able to experience the boys' steps day by day.    Chbosky could be classified as a modernist writer.  His style is very similar to the modernists containing journalistic writing, and not giving specific description of the characters.  Through his images he allows the reader to capture their own view of people, and thus they are able to relate it to their own life.  Chbosky writes a novel any person can relate to as it deals with many issues of everyday people.  His main character experiences many problems, and believes there is no hope.  As an author, his main goal is to please others, not to express his true inner feelings.  Charlie is eventually able to overcome his fear of simply being himself and allows others to accept him for who he truly is.  This book serves as an example for any teenager who has difficulties in life, and feel sometimes there is no way out.  Chbosky's overall message in this novel is nobody's life is perfect, and when you think you have hit rock bottom, you can always go up.  He contends anyone is capable of changing theirlife and seeing the good side of things.
6305897786|2.0|Nice idea, poorly executed. I kept waiting for something more interesting to happen... instead the story continued to drift without real purpose. The characters weren't particularly believable, or likeable, and there was a strong sense that something was missing. Like a decent script.<br />The online editorial mentions &quot;Polanski's languorous direction and purposefully vague story...&quot; - as if that's a selling point.  A movie is like sex: it needs a climax. And The Ninth Gate failed to fulfill. It wasn't even worth the foreplay.
6305078564|5.0|I bought this DVD set when I heard that the Bridget Jones' movie was based on this BBC adaptation.  I have to admit that I like Pride and Prejudice even more than Bridget because it provides many more hours to watch and admire Mr. Darcy.  Jennifer Erhle plays an absolutely exquisite Elizabeth Bennett.  The movie is done with fine detail and is an excellent adaptation to screen.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a classic love story.

B000003TAW|5.0|These days we are so crazily used to all those highly fashioned bands like Eve 6, Blink 182, Lit and Wheatus that sometimes we may get impression that these guys have produced and play something incredibly original and new. Alas, most of the things they use in their music were invented before, some years earlier, and among those really original inventors (such as Nirvana, Radiohead, etc.) were Weezer, the guys that became a whole chapter in the rock music history, being able in the faraway 1993 to find an amazingly right mixture of pop, heavier rock and smartful lyrics to create something really unforgettable.<br />The 1994's Weezer is easily and joyfully listenable today, sounding by no means weaker than any of the above mentioned young talents. And if you've had no idea what Weezer is, having given a listen to that cd, you would never believe the album is  7 years old.<br />All those brilliant songs including Buddy Holly, Say It Ain't So, Undone, The World Has Turned, In the Garage, and all the rest still sound so much refreshing and can compete with all the modern tunes played on the radio stations.<br />Luckily, Weezer finally have their new album to release tomorrow. Haven't we been looking forward to it?
B000007MVX|4.0|Firstly 4.5 stars. This was an amazing listen. Never has a cd passed so quickly. I totally enjoyed this cd contrary to what critics say. Musically a very strong Tull work.Not one I would recommend for the casual listener. One requires a sense of humour and patience to listen to the tale of the hare but it all seems to fit.This is the last Tull I will purchase, pending a new release, as I have everything I could need or want from beginning to end missing only the live albums which I don't feel I require to complete my collection.Tull is amazing and has now become my favourite band over the Beatles but only just.
6303255132|3.0|Good movie, but too long. Watch it when you have time to spare
B00003CXAQ|1.0|This movie is close to being the top of my top ten worst movies of all time.  I used to rent it every few years to make sure that I wasn't imagining the true waste I thought this movie was. I was always reminded after having to turn it off halfway through to always trust my instincts. Kate Capshaw turns in the most annoying female performance of all time and the young boy - short round - is the worst kid character of all time. The opening scene is wonderful fun but it's all downhill from there. A truly horrible film, not because it's boring and uninteresting (which it is) but because it's just so damn annoying. This is the cinematic version of nails on a chalkboard. Hard to believe Spielberg could stoop this low. By the way, I LOVE Raiders and The Last Crusade.
0812567110|5.0|The tricky  plot, the accurate psychological analysis, the theme of the double, of pleasure and sin make this novel still an up-to-date one and I was really fascinated by the scheming protagonist who, in a way or in another, can be told to represent the human being in all his aspects. Compelled by my teacher to read it, I didn't think this book could give me so many hints. Thanks to Oscar Wilde I had my first approach to the Aesthetic ideolgy, absolutely one of the most involving and interesting: let's do &quot;Art just for Art's Sake&quot;! Dorian Gray embodies the new intellectual who thinks life should be lived as a work of art, so that it is possible to stop the destructive power of time. He also stated the only reality is that of impressions and sensations, and everything in life should be done in order to experience every kind of sensations, no matter how to do and what society could think.  Well, I'm just a teenager and maybe for this reason I share some of Wilde-Dorian's instances: like me, the protagonist tries to reconcile wills of rebellion, linked to his soul's corruption, with desires of worldiness. In conclusion I think this is one of the best book I've ever read - and I have read al lot. I would suggest it to everybody who's willing to descover the most intimate and deepest aspects of his own soul!

068485743X|5.0|This book is fabulous!  Lukeman gives us an inside look on polishing the ms before sending it out to agents or publishers.<br />He gives advice on how to notice and remedy the overuse of adjectives and adverbs.  Followed by sseveral sections on what types of literary tools separate the 'men from the boys' in writing great fiction.  He covers: symbolism, comparisons, picking the perfect word, slimming down your prose and leaving some to the reader's imagination. <br />I would recommend to wait on this book, though, until you have a first draft to work with.  Reading this before finishing your first draft could cause you to freeze up by giving your internal editor to much ammo.
0694003611|5.0|As a bookseller, I've just plain had enough of this book.  It comes in several different forms and I've sold too many to count.<br />But my opinion doesn't matter.<br />The fact of the matter is, it's a great, soothing way to help get your child to sleep.  Children need sleep rituals, and this book is a fine example of a sleep ritual.  Saying goodnight to all of the things you love, knowing they'll still be there when you wake up.<br />This book is comforting, and deserves its status as a perennial bestseller.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Picked this one up on a whim, never having bought a Stevie/FM album ever before, and immediately fell in love!  Not a solid rock album, but certainly not a light fluffy pop mix.  Stevie's lyrics have depth and meaning and her throaty voice is simply gorgeous.  Her many collaborations on this album (with the likes of Sheryl Crow, Sarah McLachlan, and Macy Grey, among others) enhance the album and widen its appeal.  &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; collects songs written as early as the seventies and as late as this year, all blending seamlessly into the theme Stevie constructs.  Highly recommended, whether you're a previous fan or a curious onlooker!
0064400557|5.0|I watched the movie over and over, read and reread the book, and got more out of it each time.  I'll never forget my 3rd grade teacher reading it out loud to us.  <br />While they are lost in the funny, touching story, children will be learning about unconditional love and about how everyone has value.  Wilbur was &quot;Some Pig!&quot;  There was nothing spectacular about Wilbur, but he was wonderful just because he was him.  It's a wonderful lesson in self esteem and the value of friendship.
B000055X3U|5.0|For anyone that is not familar with underground metal, it would not be unfair to compare Anathema to A Perfect Circle. However, Anathema are deeper, more beautiful and by far, more powerful than APC could ever dream of being.  After not liking Alternative 4 at all, I gave Anathema another chance with Judgment. Suffice it to say, I'm really glad I'm did. There was not a more emotional cd released last year than Judgment. The majesty of &quot;Eternity&quot; is back but the songs are more bleak and if you can believe it, more beautiful.  Every time  I listen to this cd it makes me cry, or at the least, very moved. Whether I planned on it or not, whenever I hit play, I end up listening to the whole thing because it's basically a roller-coaster of emotions and stark power. The music is very Floyd-ish without any of the pretentions of Pink Floyd. The music is melodic, without any accessibility done on purpose. The lyrics are unbelievably touching and personal. By the end of the album you'll feel as if you know Anathema well. And that, my friends, is a truly unique and unforgettable experience.
031286504X|4.0|Robert Neville is the last man on Earth. The rest have been turned into bloodthirsty abominations whose only goal is to pry, to tease Robert out of his shelter. By day, Robert mercilessly destroys them as they are frozen with rigor mortis at dawn. His life has turned into a game of survival against all odds. He lives to kill.<br />&quot;I Am Legend&quot; desperately needs some cheap suspense. Otherwise, it just isn't scary. The novel's horror aspect is almost totally obscured by the measurely, prosaic depiction of its central character, his general safety in his well-protected home, and his scientific pursuits. True, there are several very powerful episodes, such as when Robert recalls the first days of the plague, when the victims of the desease return to a semblance of life. But other than that, there is few major thrills. In other words, it's not Matheson's goal to be scary. He depicts a complex, original, emotional mindscape: the gradual dehumanization of the survivor, and the mirror-image humanization of his predator-prey. Even despite the hurried ending, the gradual understanding of Robert's transformation is gripping. Furthermore, Matheson postulates a well-grounded scientific explanation of vampirism: the undeath and bloodlust are caused by a bacterium, and the fear of the cross, lack of reflection, etc. are given psychological causes.<br />The short stories following the main piece are a mixed bunch. A number of them are exceedingly straightforward, word sketches of improbable concepts, like so many &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; episodes. None of them are really scary. Matheson settles for dark irony (&quot;'When did she die?' 'As soon as I get home.'&quot;). Some, like &quot;From Shadowed Places&quot;, are outrageously old-fashioned.<br />Read for the novel, skim the stories.
6304500831|5.0|What E.T. means to Spielberg, Jungle Book meant to Walt Disney! Sigh, too bad he was not around to see the results or the impact it had on all of us. It was his last dream project but did not see the finish of it. Though I love cartoons this remains my favorite. It stole my heart as a kid and still has me captured!
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I've been listening to Dire Straits for a while now, and this has to be my favourite album of theirs. My favourite song has to be Telegraph Road with it's powerful lyrics and Mark Knopfler's stunning guitar work. The song starts off slow and moody, and near the end there is a mind-blowing solo mixed with powerful drums, keyboards, and of course, a guitar. The other songs are exceptional. Private Investigation, Love Over Gold, and It Never Rains really show how powerful and deep Dire Straits can be. This is a must have CD that can be listened to from beginning to end. Get it, NOW!
B00000IAU3|3.0|This cd is like licking 100 lollipops: sweet at first, but after a while, it gets kind of bland.  If I were to have written this review, say about 5 months ago, I would have said that this is a perfect cd.  <br />I bought this cd about 6 months ago, and the first couple hundred times listening were sweet.  Dido definitely has a great voice...very haunting, very sweet.  And the instrumentation is pretty good, in that it really frames her voice, making it an all around ethereal experience.  <br />Her songs are very good, but they would have been better if they were spanned, say over the course of two or three albums.  All these songs put together ultimately provide a monotonous compilation, with almost every song sounding like the previous and the next.<br />Thankyou and Here With Me are the songs that have received the most attention, but they are no where near as good as what's on this cd.  The real standout is the bonus track, &quot;Take My Hand.&quot;  It has a dance/club/house feel to it, but at the same time, incorporates some strings into it.  It's magical.  <br />You know how there are a few cds that you just can't live with out?  Well, this isn't one of those.  In the end, No Angel does give the listener a satisfying listen the first couple times around, but it's definely not a cd that would be considered &quot;classic&quot; say ten years from now, simply because it's all kind of boring, and not at all innovative.  Each song is a reflection of the same formula, over and over and over again.  My recommendation would be either to borrow it from a friend, or if you MUST buy it, get it second hand/used. That way, you won't be kicking yourself for spending like &amp;18.99 on a cd that's not really worth all that much in the end.
0452282152|4.0|In general, I find women to be very complex creatures. Sometimes they are capable of enormous sacrifices and other times ruthlessly selfish. They appear completely rational, but, at the same time, emotionally charged. They seem helpless but decisive in making difficult choices and committing to them.<br />Griett is everything above and more. And I cant stop admiring her. Maybe it is those qualities that are captured in the painting and that is why we are so attracted to it. 18 year-old wide-eyed maid in brown clothes. Her head wrapped in blue and yellow cloth that is coming undone, showing a few strands of her brown hair. Her indecent open mouth, pierced ear lobe with a sparkling pearl. Her eyes reflecting sadness as well as noble integrity. Captured in a painting that Griett never saw.<br />The author transformed a mundane love story into a study of women's heart. That mysterious but wonderful side of women that is just beyond our grasp and understanding but engulfs our lives regardless. Forever preserved, if not in a painting, then in our brain.
B000002UEB|5.0|In 1988, Queensryche was at the forefront of progressive metal, a genre which they helped create.  Their masterpiece Operation: Mindcrime remains to this day not only the best prog metal album ever, but, in my opinion, the best album ever.<br />The album tells the story of a man who buys into government and religious conspiracies.  He becomes a pawn of an extreme left-wing terrorist organization and begins murdering high profile religious and political leaders.  He eventually tries to leave this whacko organization, but they kill his lover--a nun--and he ends up in a mental institution.  The story starts there as he tells the listener how he arrived at that point.<br />A good story, but it is the music that makes this dark story of murder, betrayal and love so great.  Queensryche, helped by the best vocalist rock has ever seen in Geoff Tate, paints a pretty good picture for the listener.  Some songs are just dark rockers, like \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\", \\"Speak\\" and \\"Spreading the Disease\\".  But then you have moody songs that slowly build until they explode with fury like \\"The Mission\\" and the epic \\"Suite Sister Mary\\".  That's not all Operation: Mindcrime has to offer, though.  There is also the trio of radio friendly rockers \\"Breaking the Silence\\", \\"I Don't Believe in Love\\" and \\"Eyes of a Stranger\\".<br />This is a great album.  <br />For those of you unfamiliar with Queensryche's sound, they're Iron Maiden meets Pink Floyd.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I first saw Forrest Gump when I was 12 years old in 1994.  I laughed more through Forrest Gump than any other movie.  It really gave me the feeling that I was right there along with him throughout his amazing life.  Forrest Gump is one of those movies that you will want to quote in your personal life years after you've first seen the movie.  They really went all out when making this film.  No wonder it is the present #6 top grossing film of all time.

For anyone who has been touched by special teacher or a special student, you should see this film. Van Sant does a fine job of placing you behind the eyes of Jamal. By the end of the film, you feel like calling your favorite teacher and thanking them for inspiring you to reach for more. Thanks Gus, for making this film
B00005JG6Q|5.0|This was the first Anime film that I had the pleasure to view. My very first experience with anime was watching the old &quot;Starblazers&quot; series on TV. I enjoyed that show, but it seems like nothing compared to Akira. <br />  Light years beyond anything that I viewed previously, seeing this sumptuous film in the theatre was an indescribably wonderful experience, it blew me away. It opened my eyes to a whole new world of animation that has steadily grown in popularity in my country. Finally, this great film will be in a DVD format, it is about time! The artwork and story of Akira will astound anyone, not just anime fans. Buy this DVD.
0440234743|5.0|I have read &quot;The Firm&quot;, &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;, &quot;The Client&quot;, and &quot;The Runaway Jury&quot;, and &quot;The Testament&quot; was by far the most enjoyable. The book is a refreshing break from Grisham's other works, providing an uplifting message that all can appreciate. Nate's progression from a hopeless alcoholic to a responsible, thoughtful man with a new purpose in life is wonderful. I also like how Grisham portrays Rachel, her mission, and faith, without the kind of gratuitous ridicule I found in Barbara Kingsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;. All in all, a great book.

B00003CXFG|3.0|I saw the movie in the theater, and recently watched it on the special DVD, and I still have the same two thoughts I had when I left the theater - great alien animation, and disappointing.  Let's talk about the alien animation - it's gorgeous! Incredible! The aliens are added into the film so seamlessly, you really don't get the idea that it's animation.  They look so natural, you'd think the studio had hired real ones. I was blown away by it, and I still am.  Speaking of alien animation is a good segue into talking about the filming of the movie, which has moments of real creativity, and real exploration into what can be done with the physical properties of film - overexposure, severe contrast, etc - and the artistic capabilities of film - camera angles, pans and zooms, etc.  This is a very creatively filmed movie, with some wonderful bright spots of genius.  However, ultimately, the movie is disappointing, and on so many levels.  Not disappointing in the way a bad film is disappointing, but in the way that you might be disappointed in an intelligent child who only works hard enough to get Cs.<br />This is a great film, or, more precisely, should have been a great film.  It had so much potential to excel, to go beyond, and to push new boundaries in filmmaking.  And occasionally, it succeeds.  But mostly, when the movie is ready to do something truly outstanding, it instead makes a half-hearted filming attempt, and moves on to the next really-awesome seeming scene that falls short...it's like that through the whole movie.  What I was so excited about when I first saw the movie is that we see right away there's a Muslim guy on the ship, with his sons, on a trip to New Mecca.  I thought, this is really cool!, it's our first Muslim in space, but alas, his presence ultimately ends up meaning nothing except for a few lackluster theological discussions in the midst of the mayhem that comes later (\\"How can you trust your God when your sons have been killed, old man?\\" is about as far as the Muslim's faith is brought into the story).  I mean, really, what's the point of including a Muslim (or any specifically-named religion) into a movie if you aren't going to make explicit use of it - the man's faith had nothing to do with his actions in the movie.  I mean, really, it's the same as having a character that you take great pains to declare repeatedly is a great mechanic but never include a scene where he or she needs to fix something.  It becomes irrelevant.  The writers did make use of the antiquities lover/greedy guy in this movie, though - his actions were consistently in line with someone who has shown himself to be very interested in money, the fine things in life, and his own selfishness.  The movie contains a number of other scenes where the dialogue falls short, where the action should have taken a different direction to be a more interesting film, etc.<br />When I think of this film, and when I watch this film, all I see is a movie that is well-made, perhaps better than a lot of science-fiction movies, which showed so many glimpses of possible genius that didn't materialize, that I am left disappointed at the end.  One of the disappointments is that the movie had plenty of possibility to offer some thoughts on the human condition that we, the viewers, would be left thinking about - and that really is the goal of science-fiction.  For example, Vin Diesel's \\"redemption\\" was not elaborated or developed enough, so that when it happened, it felt very contrived, like the writers came to the end of the script and realized that only a sudden conversion could work, so they hastily wrote one in.  Of course, there's always the possibility that Diesel was lying (which would be good writing in this case), but the writing and the filming lead me to believe the intent of the writers was that he was redeemed - which is why it feels so contrived.<br />Vin Diesel is not a great actor, but he plays his role very well in this movie. Physically he'sgreat, and it is a real treat to watch him, especially in battle with the aliens.  In fact, the performances from the actors and actresses overall is quite good.  And most of the time the filming is brilliant - lovely use of overexposure on the desert planet, very creatively done.  The aliens are an exciting new twist to the science-fiction realm. The filming would have been helped, though, especially in the first half of the film, if it had been filmed slower.  Once the aliens show up, the pace goes very quick (which is perfectly as it should be).  Greater dramatic counterpoint, and better symbolism of the desert environment would have been achieved if the filming and pacing had been much slower in the beginning.  The movie has beautiful pans of the landscape, but they should have been longer.<br />The DVD version is wonderful - lots of cool extras, including two running audio commentaries by actors, the producer, the sound guy, etc.  Like the DVD for Se7en, this commentary offers a lot of good insight from the director about how to make a movie (even if I feel he didn't show the genius that he is apparently able to show).  If we keep our eyes on this guy, we might end up witnessing the birth of a new Ridley Scott or perhaps even an Orson Welles.great, and it is a real treat to watch him, especially in battle with the aliens.

B000002H6C|5.0|I absolutely [disliked] Metallica when I first heardthem... but I thought metal was just loud noise created to rebel against parents. [I]... continued to play them and eventually my prejudice faded and my appreciation for the musicianship of these guys grew and changed my whole musical outlook forever.  I ended up wearing out this album and several tapes.  But enough about the history lesson... this is the album that made Metallica the success they are today.  Which is plenty of reason for anybody who loved Master of Puppets and previous albums to have ample reason to [notlike] it.  It's a great album though and important to anybody who likes Metallica OR Alternica.  Either as the end of a great band or the beginning of one.
B0000248L1|4.0|The first album from Annihilator is a classic one. This is thrash metal at its best, plenty of good guitar riffs and solos. Jeff Waters showed for the first time there his impressive technique and talent, with those guitar &quot;phrases&quot; and &quot;screams&quot; that sealed the Annihilator style forever. You'll love how guitars deal with dynamics in this album, and how their sound can be aggressive, dark and lyrical at the same time. Annihilator is a machine of playing music, with tempo changes and breaks that could qualify them as a progressive metal band, instead of thrashers.<br />&quot;Crystal Ann&quot; has a classical touch that takes your breath away from the beginning. It introduces then &quot;Alison Hell&quot;, a masterpiece full of great riffs and musical experiments. The entire album has a vocal style a little bit rough for a non-trained ear, but it fits well in the dark style that Annihilator proposed in this CD. &quot;WTYD&quot; is a powerful piece, with amazing solos and rhythmical shredding.<br />However, I give the entire album four starts because it contains many other material with no transcendence, written only for headbangers, in spite of the quality of the whole CD. Nevertheless, this is not a show stopper at all. Said in one sentence, don't miss how Annihilator presented itself to the world! This release, although their first album, is a very good piece of artwork, and a must-have for any metal fan.
B000002H33|5.0|This is one of THE best rock albums of all times.  Metallica at the top of the hill, though perhaps not commercially (is that supposed to be bad?).  I like every track on this CD, even &quot;The Thing That Should Never Be&quot;, which makes me think of Blue Oyster Cult (lyrically).  This is some progressive stuff.  Think Slayer meets Queensryche and up it a few notches.  It has the speed and ballkicking power of slayer with almost the complexity of many of the great progressive rock groups.  Besides all that... it's just flat out GREAT!
B000002UB3|5.0|This album is definitely one of my favorite Beatles albums; it sounds like they knew that this would be their last album truly working together, and they try to make their final impact on the music business, and they really do that very well with it.  This album kicks off with one of my favorite Beatles tunes, &quot;Come Together&quot;, then goes into the hopeful and soothing &quot;Something&quot;.  Another highlight is &quot;I Want You So Bad (She's So Heavy)&quot;; it's 7 minutes of hearing basically nothing besides the title tracks and repetitious guitar riffs, but they do stick with you, and the jazzy element is also a &quot;cool&quot; thing, man.  The whole B-Side to the album is amazing because it all flows through.  They take a few seconds from one song and put it in another track and weave it all together.  It is definitely a landmark for the Beatles catalog and is definitely worth owning.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|To put it simply, Akira is awesome. That should be reason enough for you to buy it, but let me explain more. The story is excellent; it puts emphasis on man's potential. Basically, the whole movie says that man has enormous power that can be used for good or for evil. <br />It's not quite the action film that you've probably seen being advertised, but it still packs more than enough action. The animation is superb, and still stands out today. <br />I was drawn into the plot and the childish &quot;super-humans&quot; were intriguing. To restate what I said before, Akira is awesome. I'll defintely be buying the DVD.
B00005JHAD|5.0|it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD! everyone must see this movie!! so u can't understand a word of what brad pitt says... that's not the point... it's a great movie about this one diamond and everyone who wants the diamond....who wants the pikie to go down in the 2rd round.... who wants the caravan... it's unbelieveable!!
0393312836|5.0|Very rarely do I enjoy reading the book rather than watching the movie, but with A Clockwork Orange, it was quite the opposite.  Having seen the movie first (and loving it), I knew what to expect from the book, but I had no idea that it would leave me feeling like the movie was not nearly as good as I thought before.  The book is beautifully written, with the young Droogs own language that is confusing at first, but soon becomes easy to follow.  Burgess portrays the world of the young criminal in such a way that rather than being disgusted, I was very interested in continuing with the story.  By the end, I even felt bad for him.  Any book that can make me feel bad for a boy who enjoys rape, murder, and crime in general must be very well written.  What I enjoyed most about the book was the fact that it left so much to the imagination.  While the movie showed scenes and settings such as the woman with the cats' house and her attack, the book merely described them, which allows the reader to come up with his/her own mental picture.  I  found myself picturing things very differently from the movie, which I love.  Overall, this was an excellent book and I am overly impressed by Anthony Burgess's writing.
6300214826|5.0|Recently my dad was on Foxnews.com. He showed me something interesting. Francis Ford Coppola recently,along with editor Walter Murch,has created a new version of Apocalypse Now, with restored new footage.  <br />This version is almost an hour longer (This new version now runs at 3 hours, 14 minutes) and tells more about Brando's Character and other things, including a love relationship. <br />Recently, this 'Apocalypse Now Redux' (As Coppola called it) debuted in french theatres. It should be in the U.S in August, opefully, the same way as in France. Be sure to check it out.
B000006OS2|5.0|This is the Duke at his two-fisted, brawling best, along with Maureen O'Hara, who lights up the screen, in \\"McLintock!\\" a rousing western/comedy directed by Andrew W. McLaglen.  John Wayne is George Washington McLintock, cattle baron and owner of just about everything around for as far as the eye can see.  He owns cattle, mines and lumber, and even the town is named after him.  And he's a fair man and a good employer to boot, who pays a fair wage for a good day's work.  He even hires a young man, Devlin Warren (Patrick Wayne), who has come in with a group of homesteaders who have been given land by the government and plan to farm the Mesa Verde, even though, as McLintock warns them, it's impossible to farm at 6000 feet above sea level.  In the meantime, young Devlin has to support his mother, Louise (Yvonne De Carlo) and his sister, Alice (Aissa Wayne).  So G.W. even hires Louise to be the cook for his outfit.  McLintock is The Man in these parts, and he earns the respect he is accorded by most of the good citizens of the territory.  But he has one problem, and it's a big one; and it comes in quite a package:  His estranged wife, Katherine (O'Hara), who has just come back to town to settle a certain issue with her husband.  And the fireworks begin the minute she steps off the train.<br /> The main bone of contention has to do with their daughter, Becky (Stefanie Powers), who will be returning home from college soon.  Katherine wants to take her east to live; G.W. in having none of it.  And shades of \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,\\" that's his final answer.  The real rub is that G.W. still loves Katherine, and he still doesn't know what put the burr in her saddle and caused her to leave him two years earlier.  It's also obvious that Katherine still loves G.W., but she apparently can't get past whatever it was that caused the split in the first place.  But her eyes sparkle whenever Drago (Chill Wills), G.W.'s right hand man, brings up the \\"good ol' days,\\" and she's reminded of when they started out with nothing but each other and a lot of love and courage.<br /> There's a touch of \\"Taming of the Shrew,\\" in this story, and near the end Wayne and O'Hara virtually reenact one of their own scenes from \\"The Quiet Man,\\" all of which adds up to a couple of hours worth of good, old fashioned fun.  This movie never pretends or aspires to be anything other than what it is, which is good, wholesome entertainment that features some memorable characters, lots of humor and some classic lines.  The Duke is trim and healthy and never swaggered better, and O'Hara, in a green dress against which her gorgeous red hair absolutely glows, makes you wonder if there's ever been a more beautiful actress ever to grace the silver screen.  And the two of them have a chemistry together that ranks right up there with the best pairings the movies ever had to offer.  The Duke may be in command, but he certainly has his hands full with that fighting Irish wildcat, O'Hara.  Together, they've created some moments on screen that will live forever.<br /> Adding to the merriment is an all-star supporting cast that includes Jerry Van Dyke (Matt, Jr.), Hank Worden (Curly), Bruce Cabot (Ben), Jack Kruschen (Jake), Edgar Buchanan (Bunny), Perry Lopez (Davey Elk), Michael Pate (Puma), Strother Martin (Agard), Gordon Jones (Douglas), Robert Lowery (Governor Humphrey), H.W. Gim (Ching), Edward Faulkner (Young Ben), Chuck Roberson (Sheriff), Mari Blanchard (Camille), Leo Gordon (Jones), Bob Steele (Train Engineer) and Big John Hamilton (Fauntleroy).  McLaglen sets the pace and keeps this vintage Wayne/O'Hara vehicle right on task, which makes \\"McLintock!\\" a classic in it's own right.  It's a timeless film that captures the attitude and freedom of a time gone by that simply does not exist anymore in this, our \\"advanced\\" era of political correctness, which often stifles the very freedom it espouses.  And watching this movie, it makes you wonder about the \\"progress\\" we've madein the past thirty years or so.  As far as movies go, this one is magic, and it proves that they just don't make `em like they used to.
0792842723|5.0|YThew acting is so compelling in thius 007 outing with Brosnan as Agent 007!  I loved the scene with the tank and the train! Great stunt work! The ending was great as well!
1878424319|4.0|If you are on the search for yourself, you might want to read this book as there may be some things that you may need to hear from this work.<br />This is a simplistic draft of a few (four to be exact) agreements that one might benefit from making with oneself. I liked this book. I think that for the ease of reading it, one might get a lot out of the ideas expressed.<br />Even though I hold different ideas about personal progress, I can suggest that possibly you may find the words in this book to be just what you need to hear. I have read quite a few books on self improvement, spirituality, and wisdom. I have consumed simple and complex writings in my own personal search.<br />This is one of the simple writings. You will not find it heavy and overbearing, instead you will find it light and easy on the mind. The author will leave it up to you just exactly how to apply the ideas presented, which I believe is fitting--each individual is different and each application will vary likewise. These agreements may not be so easy to apply however, since many of us are conditioned to perform opposite of these agreements.

B000050XEI|4.0|This new cd by Enya is a great album filled with instrumental and vocal pieces guaranteed to free your mind of your worries. Her music puts you in a positive state of mind. The title track, A Day Without Rain, is a lovely piano piece reminiscent of the instrumental pieces popularized by Yanni. Some of my other favorite tracks are Flora's Secret, Wild Child, One by One, and Only Time. Try something new. Pick up a copy of A Day Without Rain and you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!!!
0440180295|4.0|This is a combination of a lot of different things.  It's funny, yet sad, and quick, but deep.  It's a fast read, but it will stick with you for a very long time.  The protagonist bounces around in time and space and the book follows his confusion as he passively progresses through the story.  Time has no meaning, and even when he hasn't been traveling, the days march on without any regard to Billy. <br />Billy Pilgrim is an observer to everything going on around him.  He has no control over the war, he has no control over the zoo he's put in, and he has no control over his own life (he only remembers proposing to his wife in a fit of pseudo-madness).  He has no power and no sense of self.  He follows along to what others do to him, or simply obeys the orders of those around him.  He's become as desensitized to life as he has to death.  Every death is closed with a simple &quot;So it goes&quot; and every living person is simply talked about, not interacted with.  There's no passion, no anger and no other emotions in his existence.  He simply reports what he observes and waits around to see what will happen to him next.<br />This book is definitely worth reading.  Ride along with Billy on his insane voyage through time and space.  See if you can discover which is more mad - strange space aliens that kidnap people for their interplanetary zoo, or the human fire-bombings of Dresden and the concentration camps of the Second World War.
6304118392|4.0|Stone effectively nails down the coffin door on America's fascination with media-delivered sex and violence.  And who would have ever known Rodney Dangerfield could be so horrifying?  Cool editing and nightmarish scenes.  You can't tell me &quot;The Drug Zone&quot; store scene didn't make you feel snakebit yourself.<br /> - JJT
B000006TRV|5.0|This is a good place to start for a new comer to Pink Floyd.  This is probably the best place to go for a fan of Roger Waters who is unsure about the rest of the band.  The two cds come together to make what can be best described as a rock opera that portrays an artist gone mad.  The music is great, but the story makes it something special. Most songs are short and morer like fragments that come together to create a journey into pain torment and finally the other side of the wall... Also reccomended the movie of the same title.
B00003CXSM|3.0|It is so rarely that an interesting, funny, for-all-ages romantic comedy comes along. Is The Wedding Planner any different from all those when-the-couple-start-out-hating-each-other-but-then-fall-in-love routined films? Not at all. However, this movie two attractive leads and enough gags (especially the scene were J-Lo's horse bolts through a forest) to entertain any willing audience. The film is pretty unrealistic even if it's premise is quite intriguing. It falls through so many traps and gets itself caught, and the film is over-long. Jennifer Lopez doesn't act too well in this film either, but Matthew McCoughaney is fantastic, and contributes a lot to the movie. All in all, its floppy fun that is bound to get a good audience, mostly for its attractive couple or the money-making premise.
0805062971|4.0|Fight Club a novel written by Chuck Palahniuk who lives and works in Portland, Oregon.  This is his first novel and is certainly one to remember.  Fight Club is a great debut for a young writer.  Fight club is a book about a guy who really has no meaning to his life until he meats Tyler Durden.  Before he meets Tyler he found himself going to support groups such as testicular cancer just to make himself feel better.  This is where he meets Marla Singer who in tern is in the same boat that he is in.  She goes to these support groups just to feel better about herself; Marlas' philosophy on life is that she could die at any moment. Enough about his background so his apartment gets mysteriously blown to pieces and he ends up living with Tyler.  Where him and Tyler start a fight club or support group for guys who feel the need to express themselves.  The first rule about fight club is you can not talk about fight club.  This book has an amazing plot for the young reader who likes a good satire.  Fight Club appeals to every different reader in a certain way.  I would recommend Fight Club to anybody who likes to read and wants a good easy reading novel.  Whether you are looking for a good thrill of a hilarious comedy Fight Club is you're book.
B0000256KE|5.0|Here is where this band really started to cook. Much more cohesive than the first album. Phil Manzanerra's guitar and Andy Mackay's sax playing improved by leaps and bounds here as well as Ferry's songwriting and vocals. &quot; In Every Dream Home A Heartache&quot; is one of the most deliciously perverse songs of that decade. Just when you think this guy might be serious, he lowers the boom on you with a silly joke which then launches the song into one of the best guitar solos ever commited to tape.<br />Just what was Roxy Music? They were 70's glam with a dash of every crooner from Rudy Valley, Sinatra and most importantly, Elvis. Now throw in a bit of The Velvet Underground, Eno's sonic experimentation, some 50's pop/rock sensibilities and it all comes together as the blueprint for New Wave. This is a very influential record
6303823351|5.0|My three daughters (ages 11, 7, and 5) are suddenly in the full thrall of Beatlemania, something I thought I'd gotten over 20 years ago. Lo and behold, they totally re-infected me at age 44! We can't seem to get &quot;1&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; and &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; out of rotation on our CD player. My kids and I also watch the DVDs of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; (which shows how truly hard core we are) every few days.<br />Anyway, I went in search of DVDs of &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; and &quot;Help&quot; and found out THEY ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE. It seems they have been TAKEN OFF THE MARKET just as the Fabs were hitting Number 1 again across the land! Same goes for VHS tapes and DVDs of the &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; and &quot;Compleat Beatles&quot; documentaries, all listed as &quot;out of print and no longer available.&quot;<br />HELLO-- Who's reponsible for this FIASCO? Someone ought to be fired immediately for this, since there's no telling how much money is being lost minute-by-minute. The Beatles are once again the HOTTEST BAND IN THE WORLD, and their best movie work is suddenly UNAVAILABLE?  The stupidity of this marketing move is almost inconceivable. <br />Anyway, I was lucky enough to find a tired, worn-out VHS tape of &quot;Help&quot; on the bottom shelf of the local video store and brought it home. The kids, of course, FLIPPED and I found myself once again amazed at what truly natural, charismatic performers the Fabs were.<br />Although rock critics have always liked &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; more, I must admit &quot;Help&quot; has always been my favorite Beatles movie. Viewing it again after 20-odd years, I'm amazed at its innocent charm and how well some of the sight gags hold up. It's a sheer pleasure to watch all the proto-music videos in it, particularly the fabulous &quot;Ticket To Ride&quot; sequence (my youngest still screams &quot;The SKI SONG! YIPPEEE!&quot; whenever the opening chords come over the stereo). The Mad Scientist character reminded my girls of &quot;The Brain.&quot; Some of the casually tossed-off lines have amazing staying power. &quot;A feindish thingee!&quot; &quot;You've got a plan, haven't you inspector?&quot; &quot;Not a bit like Cagney!&quot; &quot;Ah, you see? British! If I had a Luger...&quot; &quot;So these are the famous Beatles / So this is the famous Scotland Yard&quot; &quot;Lovely boys! Just the same as they was before they was&quot; etc. <br />The spirit of both &quot;Help&quot; and &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; is definitely &quot;cheeky,&quot; as opposed to the &quot;snotty&quot; and cynical attitude adopted by today's teen-oriented music stars (don't believe me? Compare the excruciating &quot;Jose and the Pussycats&quot; to any Beatles flick and tell me we haven't gone BACKWARDS in 30-odd years in terms of music, talent and attitude). That's the only bad part of watching or listening to the Beatles in this day and age: It reminds you that pop/rock music is long into its decadent phase, with the themes so daringly explored by the Beatles and others so long ago simply being hashed, rehashed, sampled, computerized, and spat out by today's soulless performers.<br />Anyway, I would happily buy a &quot;Help&quot; and &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; DVD IF THEY WERE AVAILABLE!  How long is this agony to last?
B0000256VK|5.0|I have always prefered Roxy's early work (pre &quot;Siren&quot;) but here is an exception. I like this one nearly as well, but for very different reasons. &quot;Siren&quot; &quot;Manifesto&quot; and &quot;Flesh And Blood&quot; did absolutely nothing for me, but &quot;Avalon&quot; has a beautifull mournfull quality to it and Ferry really gets to become a real crooner here instead of a camp parody of one. The overall somber tone is befitting what was to be their farewell album. I had the good fortune to catch them in concert on their final tour. It was a very large venue in Detroit and was only about half sold out. It was a spur of the moment thing. We drove down with no tickets, walked up to the ticket counter and somehow wound up with front row seats. They performed nearly this entire album, but also cut loose with a much from the first four albums. They gave us a glimpse of their entire evolution in about 2 hours. From pre New Wave to Dance music and to the smoky ballads contained on this classic of 80's pop. &quot;More Than This&quot; and the title track are simply two of the best romantic ballads of the 80's. Highly recomended.
6300216543|1.0|On first viewing this film I did find myself plunged into a mass of confusion. Ok, so I'm not the brightest of people but I am good with my films. The problem with this film  for me was the weakness of the other characters. Serpico was the only person we were truly aquianted with. This made it difficult, for me anyway, to get into the film. I had no emotional attachments. The story line was bland and too realistic. If i wanted to watch real life I would sit in Safeway all day. This is not what I would like to see at the cinema. If I wasn't studying it for media I would never have stuck out the whole film. However, I don't have the best attention span.
014028009X|4.0|A hilarious book that through her crazy year will make you realize your health habits aren't that bad, you're not as depressed as you might think you are, your family is actually more normal than you realized and life is just something to laugh at.  A refreshing book I would suggest to anyone who needs a good laugh at life!
6305897786|3.0|Roman Polanski returns to some old stomping grounds, although sadly not quite back to &quot;form&quot;. To its credit,&quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; does not rely on post-MTV &quot;Scream&quot; irony or F/X laden gore. Instead, the movie harkens back to the sort of deliberately paced gothic mystery Polanski once excelled at. Johnny Depp's performance as a chain-smoking, semi-alcoholic &quot;rare book&quot; expert earns the film most of its stars. Depp is hired by a mysterious rich eccentric (Frank Langella, with the ham factor cranked to &quot;11&quot;) to authenticate a volume of satanic incantations that may or may not have been co-authored by ol' &quot;Scratch&quot; himself. Much silly Euro-trash themed intrigue ensues,with a denouement oddly similar to the campy &quot;sacrificial ritual&quot; scene in Stanley Kubrick's &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;. Also along the way,luscious Lena Olin manages to shed her clothing (I think it's in her contract). Polanski's wife is thrown in as a love interest, and seems as perplexed about her character's purpose as we are. Still, just involving enough to watch all the way through at least once. The enigmatic final dissolve raises more questions than it answers, but you may be just be grateful that the film DOES eventually end!
B000002UAX|5.0|although not thier best album(that goes to revolver),it may come in 2nd or 3rd.the white album is pretty different from the albums before it,but that really doesnt make it worse.every song is great exept revolution # 9 which is strange.its not a song,it has no beat what so ever,it just a load of sounds,clips from films,explosions,&amp;paul making weirs noises like hes crying or choking or something.there is also a woman talking about being naked
B000000WZ4|4.0|I'm a big fan of the Ultra album.  I stopped listening to Depeche a year or so after Violator (which is actually probably my favorite album of them all), but I started listening again when Ultra came out.  It's typical Depeche Mode.  By that, I don't mean that it sounds exactly like anything from the previous albums.  I mean that this cd contains tracks with varying tempo, sound, emotion, etc.  Each track is great in it's own way.  I'm particularly fond of Barrel of a Gun, Home, It's no good (great video, by the way), Uselesss, and Sister of night.
0517201658|5.0|Someone once described W.S. Maugham as one of the greatest storytellers of our time for he writes with a vigorous flair, extraordinary clarity and precision and tightly disciplined with superb wit and urbanity and his sense of literary form is indeed something to conjure with. After reading Colleen McCullough's The Thorn Birds, I have come to the same conclusion, that is, the description on W.S. Maugham's penmanship can also be applied to McCullough's writing aptitude. Her style of writing is tinged with a touch of lucidity and simplicity, free from affectations and at her best, she has a delicate, condescending grace and charm. McCullough's dialogue is irrefragably excellent for the revelation of character and her command of the idioms of the ordinary speech permits her to effectuate a fine naturalness.<br />From the day of its publication in 1976, this exhilarating epic of outback life has been celebrated as the quintessential modern novel, a work that vividly brings to life all the details of life Down Under.<br />The Thorn Birds deals with the tragedy of ordinary lives, unfolded with an intense compassion and profound insight into the truth of the multifarious characters. McCullough fleshes out each and every character with minuteness and precision. The characters are common people, extremely down-to-earth and are convincingly and irrefutably alive. We have already taken notice of her bold and believable characterisation in Tim, her first novel which is an extremely poignant love story told with profound candour that acutely delves with acumen and insight into the affinity and emotional consequences of a forbidden love between an ingratiating, mentally-retarded young labourer and a middle-aged spinster.<br />Concealed behind her writing lies a sense of tragedy of life, in which transgression and iniquity or folly brings its own retributions, especially Justine O'Neil, who sets a course of life and love halfway round the world from her roots in Gillanbone, Australia, to become an actress in London, who lost her virginity at the tender age of eighteen, and who at the end of the novel ultimately repent.<br />McCullough can command a beauty of perspicuous expression that provokes the very emotional part of the erring human heart, a sweet, mellifluous, dulcet and piercing melody of infinite regret and yearning:<br />\\"In the morning they stared, awed and dismayed, at a landscape so alien they had not dreamed anything like it existed on the same planet as New Zealand. The rolling hills were there certainly, but absolutely nothing else reminiscent of home. It was all brown and grey, even the trees!<br />\\"The winter wheat was already turned a fawnish silver by the glaring sun, miles upon miles of rippling and bending in the wind, broken only by the strands of thin, spindling, blue-leafed trees and dusty clumps of tired grey bushes. Fee's stoical eyes surveyed the scene without changing expression but poor Meggie's were full of tears. It was horrible, fenceless and vast, without a trace of green.\\"<br />From this short abstract itself, McCullough depicts the enigmatic and intractable Australian background with striking vividness.<br />Of all the characters delineated in this rousingly recounted saga of a grazier clan over a span of fifty-four years (between 1915 and 1969), none is better drawn than that of Meggie Cleary. It seems McCullough has put much of herself into the creation of the story, and in many ways, Colleen McCullough resembles Meggie Cleary. Even minor figures are drawn with sure, minimal brush strokes.<br />The Thorn Birds is impregnated with memorable scenes that are vividly etched in the reader's mind. The heroine and main protagonist at the heart of the story, Meggie Cleary, whose passionate and forbidden love for the handsome, magnificent Catholic priest, Ralph De Bricassart, who is two decades older than her, is veritably the stuff of legend; her broken marriage to Luke O'Neil; her giving birth to Justine O'Neil,the brilliant actress, and Dane O'Neil, who was not fathered by O'Neil but by De Bricassart himself without his knowledge: these are some of the episodes that may linger in the reader's memory long after he has put the novel down. Alas, the course of true love is littered with thorns.<br />Much of the fascination of The Thorn Birds can be traced to its blend of high romance and whim with undeniably realistic characters and background. This novel will undoubtedly be considered as McCullough's paragon, a masterpiece, because of its brilliant descriptive passages, the myriad poignant moments and the dramatic plot. She is indeed a writer of ingenuity and imaginative force. In complete control of her plot, her prose sways as gracefully as a waltz, glinting with irony, and meticulous in its detail and accent.<br />In this family saga, McCullough fuses intriguing period detail onto a generational saga that features a host of superbly wrought characters. Thoroughly enjoyable, this novel offers intelligent, witty entertainment. Its clean prose, empathetic characters, a richly observed tale of love and despair, unravel the tangled threads of doomed relationship. By capturing the dusty, dry essence of life in the Australian outback.<br />McCullough's real strength lies in her plotting and pacing, an eye for detail, and at creating a host of minor characters that people the landscape of her novel. Where her characters are caught up in a complex world of emotional connections and confusion, intertwined by the ties that bind them. Against a richly nuanced backdrop of people, place and history, it captures not only the breathless drama and agonising banality of life and all that it engenders, buts its abundant paradoxes as well.<br />Gripping and awashed with dramatic nuances, rich in detail and densely textured, The Thorn Birds sings with an undertone of elegiac melancholy. Read it and weep!
B000002KO3|5.0|Unquestionably the supreme art achievement of the Heads' oeuvre (and perhaps of New Wave music in general), Remain In Light continues to hypnotize, seduce and delight twenty years since its original release.  As other reviewers have noted, the album begins with three exciting, danceable, heavily-layered synth tunes that flow into one another like some fast moving, bubbling river, carrying the listener swiftly down their rapids for the first twenty minutes.  But the challenge of Remain In Light came when you flipped the LP or cassette over and played Side 2, because then you experienced the sea change away from the fun, funky mental space Side 1 had created. (In some ways, the passing of the vinyl age has obscured the clever symmetry of this work.) Side 2's first piece, Once in a Lifetime, was the hinge.  The song melodically and rhythmically echoes the three on Side 1, but with a quiet darker side that is unmasked when Byrne, describing the existential awakening of his protagonist, cries out: &quot;My God! What have I done!&quot;  From there, remaining in light becomes increasingly impossible as the music creeps ever more slowly into a dark and moody landscape of despair and pain.  Yes, the Overload is a monotonous dirge.  But guess what?  As the last tune on the album, that's just exactly where the Heads wanted to take you.  You just didn't guess that the title of the album was a CHALLENGE.  I admit that, more times than I can count, I have put on this CD and turned it off before I got through Track 5.  But if you make it all the way to the end, aside from the stunned silence, there is an enormous sense of accomplishment.  Come away from this album unchanged, and you're probably not listening.  And for those who are afraid of the dark, at least they gave you a blast of great dance music before you got there, right?  Face it: getting depressed was never such a good trip.

This cd is my favorite that I own, and if you love Blink but are not allowed to get cds with &quot;Explicit Content,&quot; you should get this! Oh, and enough of this bull about Blink being sellouts!

0553213105|3.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a satirical commentary on nineteenth century society.  Austen uses dry humor and irony to show the absurdities of her time.  Extreme characters such as Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet are used to accentuate the sexism of her society, and characters such as Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine De Bough are used to show the culture's obsession with wealth and power.  Austen uses the character Elizabeth Bennet to counter these negative values.  Elizabeth does not conform to the society's beliefs of how women should act, and she believes in marrying only for love.  This novel is enjoyable to read, although it is at times wordy and somewhat predictable.  The general plot is not overly exciting or suspensful.  However, the problems of sexism and egotism examined in this work are issues still prevelent today.  Therefore, readers, especially young women, can relate to this novel.  As an AP English student, I would not highly recomend this novel to other AP students.  While I did enjoy reading it, I did not find it to be on the same level as the other books I read this year.  It took little analysis to find the &quot;deeper meaning&quot; of the novel.  Although it was not as chalenging as other books that I have read this year, many of the themes would lend nicely to the final thematic question on the exam.  I would not replace another AP novel with this, but I would read it as a supplement to the AP curriculum.
0062502182|4.0|One may believe that the world does not exist as a single organism, that everything is coincidental and unrelated. I don't!<br />Man continues to search for common laws to explain all matter. Complexity is one of these studies, whereby all matter, living and non-living, organise into more complex structures to perform complicated tasks. From the complexity of the human eye, the stock exchange and our world to the single cell amoeba organism, all may combine to accomplish common outcomes.<br />What am I going on about? Perhaps these common laws to achieve organisation from chaos will work faster for you with positive energy. Perhaps the unresolved solutions that you desire will be achieved as we organise to reach our personal and group goals.<br />The book emphasises that the search towards your dreams and goals is a most fulfilling journey. If you just receive a simple message to believe in yourself and follow your dreams, the author has succeeded.
014028009X|4.0|I would say if your looking for a funny , witty, sassy book then buy it. If you want something serious don't. I enjoyed it but you have to remember not to take every thing so seriously. People who didn't like it seem disappointed that it wasn't a great work of literature. It's just a fun book. A fantastic vacation or beach read. I am not a singleton but a married {though not smug) and I laughed out loud at the things that run through her head. She is funny and believable and very very human. I am heading to the book store tomorrow to get The edge of reason. I have to know what comes next.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Moulin Rouge soundtrack packs a lot of dynamite inside! From the gritty version of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; to &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot;, 'Moulin Rouge' is a bottle of soft drink roughly shaken 15 times, waiting for the day when you take the lid off. I love the sound of Ewan McGreggor and Alessandro Safina singing Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot; and yes, I am pleasantly surprised when I hear that Nicole Kidman can really sing! Just listen to her version of &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot;, and you can really sense the hidden strength of her voice. Ewan's voice is a wonder as well - unpretentious and clear.<br />This album is like a patchwork of blaringly colourful individual pieces. Take them one by one, and each song would be more palatable, but put them all together, you'd have an explosion!
B000056K04|3.0|3 stars seems too little, but it's just not good enough to be a 4.  There's really no original input I have regarding this CD that other people haven't already said, but just to add my 2 cents worth:<br />The lyrics are fine, overall, and the music is good, but subpar by DMB standards.  I hate to group them in the &quot;mainstream music&quot; genre, but these guys are five of the best musicians in the scene, and unfortunately the material here is just lacking the emotion of their previous four albums.  I feel that until now, they've improved with each new release, and it's a shame, but when a band fails to improve on their most recent album, they're labeled as sell-outs.  I don't consider that the case here though, since they didn't run out of good songs, they just chose to release 12 more upbeat songs.  Hopefully though, they'll put out The Lillywhite Sessions soon, which I, like so many other fans, was forced to download illegally when it was withheld from us.  Trust me, it's much better than Everyday, and it would've followed Before These Crowded Streets perfectly.  And I mean, absolutely perfectly.  No one would've been disappointed.  In fact, Everyday would've been a nice follow up to The Lillywhite Sessions.  I'm just having a hard time trying to figure out why they opted for this album instead, or why they didn't just release both albums around the same time.  But word has it that the band was down and depressed, and they thought a happier sounding CD would be therapeutic.<br />Not to come down too much on this, I really like about four or five songs on Everyday.  As for the rest, take it or leave it.  And do the band a favor, if you absolutely must have The Lillywhite Sessions now, donate $10-15 to the band's favorite charity, or make sure to buy the actual CD when it is eventually released.  Actually Dave Matthews encourages bootlegging of their music and he supports Napster; he's really cool about it, but I believe good musicians deserve to be paid well, so keep that in mind.
B000001Y5J|5.0|The absence of a new album, the growing frustration of a demanding record label, an artist losing his mind. Not the ideal circumstances for a record to be made but Broken was the outcome of such events that contributed to this angry and intense mini-album. The second NIN album, well sort of, contains six tracks and two bonus cuts which if a full-length album would rank as NIN's most satisfying work. As it is, Broken is near essential if you consider yourself a loyal NIN fan. The short instrumental Pinon kicks things off before Wish sends the listener into a moshing frenzy. Second track Wish won a Grammy award for Trent, quite an achievement considering the song contains enough swear words to embarrass a vicar.<br />There could almost be a checklist for a NIN song - the angst-ridden lyrics...check, thrashy guitars...check, the quiet-verse-loud-chorus template...check. That isn't to say it's predictable, just what's become expected. The standout track Happiness In Slavery, complete with video nasty, is astonishing industrial carnage - clearly NIN are on top of their game spewing out lyrics such as &quot;human junk just words and so much skin / stick my hands thru the cage of this endless routine / just flesh caught in this big broken machine&quot;. Then Gave Up ends the album - or does it? After reaching track 98 on the CD player the humming sound of Physical (You're So) drifts from the speakers. Not a true NIN song, it's a reworking of the Adam Ant song which isn't as strange as finding out it is actually very good. The other extra track of Pigface's Suck lacks the original's atmospheric vibe but makes up in bluntness. The major weakness is it isn't long enough - but also it's greatest strength - making the listener yearn for more later fulfilled on the companying Fixed remix EP.
0446343129|4.0|This is an important book on a vital subject.  Very worth reading, as long as you remember not to believe every word.  Parts of it seem to be well researched, but the untrue parts make it hard to know how to view the rest.  The author speculates at length on the medical discovery of diabetes, implying it was unknown before refined sugar entered the diet in the last millenium, but in fact diabetes was described more than 2000 years ago.  It would be nice if there were a revised edition or another book on the subject that was more based in fact.  But after reading this it's hard to say exactly what differentiates sugar from opium or cocaine: they all have clear physiological effects, all are found naturally in plants, and all can create a dependency.  Of course sugar is a lot cheaper and government sanctioned, and those who really can't tolerate it (diabetics) get insurance-covered treatment.
B0000025RI|5.0|If one goes by number of units sold, then Michael Jackson's Thriller is the greatest album of all-time.  All it did was sell more than 40 million copies and break the previous record which was held by the Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack.  Sadly, it doesn't seem like Jackson ever recovered from this achievement.  Granted he followed Thriller with Bad which sold 20 million copies, but Dangerous, HIStory, and Blood on the Dance Floor were all disappointments.  Jackson has also gone through all kinds of things that would cause normal people to lose their sanity a long time ago.  It's really sad to see such a talented artist go downhill like this.  Well back to Thriller--the first album to ever have 7 singles hit the top 10.  Here are the best tracks:<br />1) Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' -- A very good dance and upbeat track.  I especially like the end where the background singers sing really fast.<br />4) Thriller -- A little hokey, it still has a great beat.  I could probably do without the Vincent Price rap, though.<br />5) Beat It -- One of 2 #1's on the album, this may be one of the most perfect songs ever made.  Eddie Van Halen's guitar solo is just scintillating.<br />6) Billie Jean -- The other #1 on the album and truly one of MJ's most beloved songs.  It's a song that never goes out of style.  I'll never forget the video to it.<br />7) Human Nature -- A truly underrated song, it was sort of forgotten with all the other hits on this album, but Jackson gives one of his best performances with it.<br />8) PYT -- I love the instrumentation on this song.<br />All the tracks are good, but I still feel that Off the Wall is the better album.  However, Thriller is one of those albums that every music lover has to have for their collection.
B00000K31Q|5.0|this movie was a total surprise to me, i expected it to be just another teenie-bopper movie with a lame plot.  but i was totally surprised when i actually found it cute, funny, and entertaining.  i absolutely love the scene with heath ledger singing on the soccer field (i always seem to rewind and watch that part over and over).  the humor was also suprisingly good, especially the stratford father, he was hilarious.  so, don't just write this movie off because it looks lame and just like all the others.  it's the only teenage movie of it's kind that is worth buying.
B0000508U6|3.0|This was recommended to me by Amazon.com cuz I like Gomez, Badly Drawn Boy and Radiohead.  I downloaded Shiver from Napster, and that was enough for my wife, who bought it and loves it.  As for me, I can't get into it, and I've tried.  I really have.  There are about three songs I like on it.  Not enough as far as I'm concerned..... Since I give it two stars and my wife gives it four, I'm going for the average and saying 3.
B0000028UK|4.0|As a collective, Vs stands out as Pearl Jam's most cohesive offering to date. It is also the closest studio recording to what the real live Pearl Jam experience - raw, intense, passionate, spontaneous. The suckerpunch opening of the short and snappy Go and the swaggering Animal are taken from the top draw of alternative rock- on this inspired form, no one could touch the band. Fans lapped up single Dissident as it sounds like a Ten outtake, the huge guitar riff and overstrained Eddie Vedder vocals setting the heart racing. The great strength of Vs is that no matter how fast or hard the song is pushed, the playing never loses precision. In some ways, the music feels too slick when the punk-rock chaos, the kind that Nirvana was masters at, would be unleashed instead being held back. The understated Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town is a welcome break between the high drama that surrounds it, an indicator for the quieter, more restrained direction the band would take on future album tracks Nothingman, Wishlist and Sometimes. On release Vs became the fastest selling album ever (although pop muppets N'Synch now hold that record), giving an idea of the impact and popularity that Pearl Jam attained during 1993. It was not known at the time that this was the peak and from then on it was downhill.
B000059PR5|5.0|This is one of the most haunting flim I have ever had the luck to see.  Jason Robarbs is top notch in this movie.  I'm so happy to see that it is finally on VHS.  I wished that all the powers of the world could be forced to watch this truely moving show.  I show this on TV the first time it was shown and have never gotten over the imagies that this movie brings into your home.  An excellent flim, well worth seeing.  I would not recommend this to small children, this flim is very realistic and could be very disturbing to them.  I recommend this to older persons, it is a tour deforce in acting, script and directing.
B00000269M|5.0|Wouldn't you have hated to be Michael Jackson around 1986 to 1987?  You're fixing to release your 3rd solo album and the official follow-up to the most successful album ever in Thriller.  The resulting work would be Bad which would sell around 20 million or roughly half what Thriller sold.  Bad would be the first album ever to have 5 #1's on it.  However, in my opinion unlike Off the Wall and Thriller in which every track was good there were some forgettable tracks on Bad.  This would start an alarming pattern for Jackson as his following albums after Bad would be uneven at best.  I really feel that he was never the same after Bad and alot of that had to do with the unrealistic expectations he had in topping Thriller.  The best tracks in my opinion on the album are as follows:<br />1) Bad -- A great up-tempo song, it was a smart choice to kick off the album.<br />7) Man in the Mirror -- One of my all-time favorite MJ songs.  It may be his greatest ballad as only She's Out of my Life gives it any competition.  Great background vocals by MJ, Siedah Garrett (who co-wrote the song), the Winans, and the Andrae Crouch Choir (who MJ would use on other songs in the future).<br />8) I Just Can't Stop Loving You -- A song that I swear that I do not remember hearing when it first came out.  MJ's vocals sound alot like his partner's, Siedah Garrett.<br />9) Dirty Diana -- A great rockin' track that was sort of the sequel to Beat It.  Steve Stevens, who was Billy Idol's guitarist, gives a great performance here and he tells one of the funniest stories I've ever heard.  In a book on Billboard #1 hits, he tells how Quincy Jones has all these unusual sayings including the classic, &quot;Steve, could you put a little more custard in your cone, man?&quot;  (Q meant that Steve was playing behind the beat).<br />10) Smooth Criminal -- Great overall feel to this song as MJ sings the vocals in machine gun like fashion.<br />11) Leave Me Alone -- A bonus track, I just like the overall feel of this song.  However, I did not like the video.  It (the video) sorta enhanced MJ's weirdness.<br />IMHO, Bad was the last great Michael Jackson album.  I really feel that since Bad he has put out mediocre material.
6302800420|4.0|Great movie, but this isn't a very good film-to-video transfer.  For one, they really botch the &quot;pan'n'scan&quot;, which is the method of reducing the original widescreen ratio to fit the more square-shaped television screen.  This involves focusing in on a key portion of the screen, kind of like 'filming the film'.  I'm partial to widescreen, but as far as comedies go, the full imagery isn't as important.  Still, the scans from one portion of a shot to other are just plain awkward, and look nothing like the natural moves of the film.  Almost as bad as the full screen version of Ghostbusters II.  Go for the widescreen DVD, and see the film as it was meant to be seen.
0060278234|5.0|Lirael takes place several years after the time of Sabriel, in the old kingdom. And as usual, something fishy is going on. Someone is blocking the Clayrs' Sight and from one paticular area. Prince Sameth, son of Sabriel, is having Death troubles of his own. Meanwhile, Lirael struggles with her Sightlessness and becomes a librarian. The end of this book is slightly twisted and suprising. Also, it ends on a cliffhanger and it's to be continued in the third book, Abhorsen. When reading, expect the unexpected. And Garth Nix, keep up the good work!
B000002AZ8|4.0|It would be fair to say that as an album, Vitalogy is Pearl Jam's most inconsistent and baffling. But at the same time it would be fair to say it also contains many of the bands greatest and most cherished songs. Any album that contains Betterman, Last Exit, Corduroy and Immortality would in my book be hailed as a great album. But include the indulgent instrumental Pry To, the uneasy listening of Bugs and the overlong and tedious Stupid Mop and the album loses its impact. After a few plays, I felt the great urge to skip past the filler material once the novelty feeling was lost, why couldn't it had been edited better? The over emphasis of this point would mean all but Pearl Jam fanatic will nowadays avoid Vitalogy like the plague which would be a shame as though Ten, Vs and Yield are better overall, Vitalogy delivers a telling snapshot of Pearl Jam at a critical and highly creative stage of their career. Considering to call it a day in the aftermath of Kurt Cobain's suicide, the Grungsters pulled through when others would become disillusioned and split up thus resulting in highly charged and emotional songs of Better Man's quality. In effect it matured the band both individually and musically with the songwriting becoming stronger and more focused, exploited on latter releases.
B00005AXEL|4.0|To say that this is the best since Bella Donna is an understatment!  It surpasses that album and is by far the best effort to date. She is able to experiment with different  producers and still remain true to the her unique style of story telling(the best being between her and Sheryl Crow, especially on Candlebright and Sorcerer). Her writing is as fresh as ever and she has the uncanny knack to draw her listeners into another world and let them forget about the harsh realities of the real<br />world. After all these years she still has us enthralled with the beauty of her voice and the gift of her poetry.  For that I am  forever thankful.
0446364495|5.0|In this book a woman named, Francesca, falls in love for a photographer named, Robert. When this occurs her husband, Richard, is away with their children. She ends up finding a new part of herself with-in the four days they have together. When Robert tells her he is leaving soon, she has to make a decision whether or not she will go with him. She decides to stay with her family and hold her love secretly inside her. I have not read a lot of books like this, out of the ones I have this on really gets to you. This book has an aspect of love that most other books don't deal with. This is where one of the partners that has fallen in love is torn between her lover and her family. Some do deal with this but it is the part where that partner torn stays with the family. Here Francesca is married, and Robert is dedicated to his work of photography, and neither wanted to give up there lives. I loved it because some books that have this certain situation, they usually let the other person they ar einvolved with go. But not this one, no, he leaves and she stays. I loved it so much because it goes to show that even if you are married and committed there could be someone that you meet and fall in love with them. Even if it's not love you could become infatuated or obssessed with the thought of being with them. Everyone likes the feeling of being in a secure relationship and this book proves not everything si guaranteed. Robert is a calm and cool collected and I strive to be like this character. It's the way he talks so gently and forcefully that Francesca just has to listen. Robert says there love is,&quot;in a universe of ambiguity, this kind of certainty comes once.&quot; This book is not for everyone, especially if you feel that your partner is cheating or if you have a fear that someone couldn't commit ot you. This could make you more afraid or suspicious. Or it could do the exact opposite and you find that all of your fears are not needed. If you like general romance books you'll like the subtleness of this one.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I bought this immediately because I enjoyed The Real Slim Shady, and one of my local radio stations gave a sneak preview at the song Stan.  I was very impressed, and bought the album.  Eminem is definately pretty smart.  Like Marilyn Manson, I believe he is going for shock value here.  Stan is brilliant, and using the parts from Dido's song Thank You makes it sound sophisticated.  The Real Slim Shady was appropriate enough to get on mainstream radio, and The Way I Am is on the better side.  But then he gets downright nasty with songs like Kill You and the horrible Kim.  These songs are so hateful and just plain disturbing that they shouldn't have been recorded.  Also the anti-women and anti-gay views he has in some of his songs are, in my opinion, very cruel.  Criminal is a pretty strong track, and some think it's pretty humorous.  Marshall Mathers is a sophisticated version of The Real Slim Shady in which he discusses his views on various points, and it works very well.  I think this is overall a good album (Except for the two previously mentioned tracks and some of the interludes) and Eminem will definately stay in the record business for a bit longer.  Oh yeah, and fans of his first album may be a bit angered at this one, as his views have changed from being the one beat-up to being the one beating-up.  Vice versa, if you hated his first album, then maybe you'll like this one.
B00004VXF2|4.0|This album provides astonishingly accurate insights into the global economics of today's multinational financial institutions.

B00005AXEL|5.0|Once again I have to admit that the best contemporary music comes from artsits &quot;out of date&quot;. Just like the last year Carly Simon's &quot;The bedroom tapes&quot;, the new Stevie's CD is outstanding and able to make me feel real emotions in every line of every track. The best for me are &quot;Planets of the universe&quot;, &quot;Every day&quot; and &quot;I miss you&quot;, highlights in Stevie's career. Until we can count on &quot;jurassic&quot; artists like Stevie, Carly e a few more, our ears are safe.
0525457585|5.0|The Neverending Story by Michael Ende is a wonderful book.  The fantastic images and elaborate detail portrays real life in a very surreal manner.  The book has many levels of meaning, and is a pleasure to read.  The determination of Atreyu, the main character and hero, is inspiring and entertaining.  Though the events are usually unrealistic, they are symbolic of the obstacles we face in our everyday lives.  I recommend anyone needing a break from reality to read this book; it is a fun way to reflect on your life.
B0000020C4|5.0|I was awed by this CD and the music in it.  I received both the CD and the video as birthday gifts and admit to enjoying the video even more than the CD just because you can watch the exressions on faces.<br />This 10th anniversary rendition is where I developed an intense interest in Michael Ball.  I was enjoying the video and all of the music until I hit &quot;Empty Chairs...&quot; and I thought &quot;whoa&quot;.  I went to the internet the next day, discovered who Michael Ball was and then ordered every CD he ever made.<br />But, this CD and video is the absolute best I have heard and seen.  No matter which of the singers is your personal favorite, you will find something to like.  What wonderful music.  I even enjoyed watching the the handsome conductor, he was excellent.<br />No one should regret purchasing this CD or video.
0441172717|5.0|Frank Herbert's science fiction epic Dune is considered the definitive science fiction/fantasy novel.  After reading it, I felt the same.  It has everything you've ever wanted in a sci-fi story and more.  This book has plenty of characters, of whom nearly all are described in great detail or play major roles in the book.  This book uses lots of very descriptive writing to describe alien environments and other cosmic locales, which are also quite abundant as well.  This book has a simple name that can be shortened easily when writing book reports and not sound awkward in the least, unlike The House of Seven Gables or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.            Dune contains many fascinating aspects that present the book in a much more serious perspective than would had they not been used.  For example, Herbert employs a type of narration that serves as a more strategic use of standard plot hopping. Herbert's writing style is one in which a writer will switch the plot over to different characters after nearly every other chapter.  Whenever the plot line involving certain characters becomes tense, the reader will become anxious.  The writer will then take this segment of the plot and continue on with it for a few chapters or so until the reader becomes so excited that he or she cannot hold the book steady any longer.  As soon as the peak in these most gripping chapters is reached, the writer completely terminates your connection to that specific plot branch, and moves on to a different one.  The writer will stay on this separate plot line and others until your interest in the previous one disappears, so by the time the writer gets back around to it, you won't care what happens to the characters in it.  Although this writing style has been notorious for deterring readers the world over, Herbert's characters and environments are so unique and interesting that you'll want to continue reading despite the fidgety plot.            Another one of Dune's trademark characteristics is Herbert's use of philosophy, which is used quite frequently in character dialogue.  Because two of the major organizations in the Dune universe are intellectual schools, the people that act as representatives from these schools speak intellectually, using words as a weapon and making statements with hidden meanings.  The members of the royal houses use these philosophical ideas and methods of speech as well, but they are much easier to understand, because Herbert wants to give you the idea that these people are distinguished.  The philosophical dialogue used in Dune may be difficult to read at first, but by the end of the book, the language becomes tolerable, if not understandable.  If you choose to read the rest of the books in the series, beware.  Philosophical speech is used in all of the Dune books.            The most important aspects of Dune are its characters and its setting.  For the most part, the story takes place on a dry desert planet named Arrakis, also referred to as Dune by its inhabitants, and the main characters are Paul Atreides and his mother, the Lady Jessica.  Dune represents desolation and desertion, and also stresses the fact that Paul and his mother are like fish out of water, because they came from a lush, earthlike planet, and are now on a planet where water equals power.  Later in the novel, Paul and Jessica are given shelter by Stilgar, a Fremen.  Fremen, by the way, are the people native to Arrakis.  They have strict rules governing water distribution, and treat the desert-dwelling sandworm like a deity, among other things.  Over a period of several years, Paul and his mother become Fremen.  They adopt Fremen customs, act like Fremen, dress like Fremen, and obey all Fremen rules.  They both go through a complete change of character.  While they change, others remain the same.  The Baron Harkonnen, for example, continues to live a gluttonous, decadent, and otherwise repellent lifestyle.  But then again, that's just his character.Dune is very hard not to take seriously.  People die, kill, betray, execute, plot, scheme, and ruin other people in an accurate representation of what life and human relations may be like in the future, eight thousand years from now.  Situations like this are what attracts people to read Dune, and keeps fans coming back for more.
0792156684|4.0|Against the backdrop of the oceanliner disaster we have one of the most incredible motion picture love stories of all time.  TITANIC is a breathtaking work of labor for it's director.  The notorious budget is at least evident on the screen in spades!  Every frame is a work of art - often a terrible picture of the reality of such a disaster.  Now you can almost feel like you are there.<br />The story is also quite good.  The social and moral issues addressed will leave you thinking about human nature.  Chances are you'll walk away from TITANIC wondering what you would do.<br />DiCaprio and Winslet are unforgetable!  I'm glad to see a full-figured woman in the lead of a major motion picture.  Hollywood has painted a picture of beauty in the form of the Kate Moss type for too long.  Also, Kathy Bates' Molly Brown is terrific when she declares:  &quot;Grab the oars ladies, we're going back!&quot;  And Rose's mother wanting to be sure the seating on the lifeboat was separated by class.  There's just so much to like about TITANIC I can't see the faults that other people mention.  During the last moments of the ship going down I don't think I took a breath.  Anything less than 5 stars for the movie itself is inaccurate.<br />As for the DVD the sound was excellent 5.1 surround.  The picture is a different story.  I expected a standard super sharp picture thoughtout; but got one that is often faded, hazy or overly grainy.  At times the color was brilliant; other times lacking.  It should be better since this picture is only a few years old (1997).  On a scale of 1 to 5 I'd give the picture a 4 overall.  Still, it's better than my VHS tape copy.  But I can't give the DVD presentation a perfect 5 as I'd like to.<br />The verdict:  Okay gentlemen!  Here's a love story that'll make you cry like a girl!  But you didn't catch me saying that...
B0000025P9|4.0|I remeber this record when it first came out.  Rosanna was in heavy rotation on the radio, and so was Africa.  The one that I really like is &quot;Make Believe&quot;.  The artistry in the piano playing on that one, along with the harmonizing vocals are what make this song a standout.<br />I love &quot;Africa&quot;, and it is a song that even almost twent years after its release, sounds like new every time I hear it.<br />Toto is an amazing group, and their music will last forever.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Britney Spears has no talent whatsoever - she has other people write songs and choreograph dances for her. Then, she runs her voice through a computer to make it sound better (i.e. the Simpsons episode where they make a boy band and the amp shuts off). I have to admit that I am biased against this type of music, but then again I could take anything else over this, Backstreet Boys, *NSync, 98 Degrees, my sister listens to all of it too loudly and I've experienced the full horror of it all and I can say I hate Britney Spears much more than any other teeny-bopper pop stars. So do the world a favor and go buy an album by one of the following bands, everyone will like one of the following bands/artists: Metallica, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath, Queen, Frank Sinatra, Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, or even Beethoven or Mozart. You'll probably be pleasantly surprised, its actually music!
0812589041|5.0|At first look Ender's Game seems to be about the minutia of a child's life: Ender who has some sort of device called a &quot;Monitor&quot; which allows adults to keep track of his every move &amp; protect him.  Then, we turn over the first page.  Ender's Game isn't just a story about children forced to grow up at warp speed.  It isn't just a story about one of these children who stood out among the pack.  Ender's Game is a challenge to those who ignore or discredit the children's ideas because they are children.  We begin to understand Ender, emphasize with ender -- and finally respect ender.  Somewhere, during chapter two or three, I forgot that the subject of the story was a 7 year old boy -- and begin to think of him as a brilliant military strategist.  Beyond this, though, the book raises some even more important philosophical questions about truth and reality (which are not explained until the final pages of the book -- I'll refrain from spoiling it).  Read it slowly, carefully, and deliberately though -- because when you have finished the book, you will wish that you could somehow go back and read it again for the first time!
B00005J6UP|5.0|Steven Spielberg has been able to remain in touch with his inner child and he obviously has been able to find a simpatico match with others, as evidenced by most of the reviews for this movie.I must admit I'm slightly prejudiced because I only live 35 miles from Astoria and have seen most all of the places where the movie was filmed many times. Knowing that, it isn't &quot;just a movie&quot;. Like so many others, I dreamed of fighting pirates and bad guys when I was a kid, and this movie spoke to that child in me who still exists. Every time I drive by Goonie house, I almost expect to see someone sliding across a wire from one house to the next, or old lady Fratelli breaking her boys from the jail. (It's still there for all to see.)That's the fun part about movies. Was it really real? Who cares. It was fun, wasn't it? That's all that counts. I'm really looking forward to seeing this on DVD. I'm sure my boys (who are both adults now) will too. Maybe I'll have them and their kids over that weekend and we'll relive the fun anew with the grandkids.
B00003CXE7|5.0|The acyion sceans were toataly cool and the story was general but when they were wraped up into one seqence it made a really good moovie. It's about a general who is sent to die but escapes and when he gets home his family has already been murdered by Cesars men he faints and when he wakes up  he is being carried in a gurrny like thing. Ther's your intro.
1558216847|5.0|This emotionally riveting often poignant story recaps the arrest, trial, and sentencing of Polish officer Slavomir Rawicz by the Soviets after they annexed Poland during the WW II era.  But wait, that is just the first chapter!!<br />One year later, Rawicz and six other partners in crime escape from the oppressive Siberian labor camp where they were imprisoned (with help from a most surprising source).  With a sentence of 25 year hanging over his head Rawicz figured he had nothing to lose.  The escapees came from different ethnic backgrounds but were united in one common accord.  Escape, The duty of every prisoner.<br />They start out over the long trek across Siberia toward British controlled India.  Along the way they endured starvation, sickness, exposure to freezing elements, the heat and thirst of the Gobi desert, and many other plights.  Imagine crossing the Himalayas in the winter with no protective clothing and very little food and no way of melting snow for water.   But through it all they never lost their desire for freedom.  THEY WOULD RATHER HAD DIED IN THE WILDERNESS AS FREE MEN THAN LIVED AS PRISONERS OF AN EVIL EMPIRE CONVICTED OF CRIMES THEY NEVER COMMITTED.<br />And as a teaser to get you to read the book I ask:  And what about the Yeti?  Did you believe it?<br />I don't give a lot of 5 star ratings but this one is well earned.
0812550757|5.0|As a book in it's own right, Speaker for the Dead clearly deserves all five stars.  As a sequel to Ender's Game, however, it both fulfils us and disappoints us.  We know at the end of Ender's Game that Ender regrets his acts towards the buggers and has consequentially written their story to show humanity how wrong they were.  Ironically, we find, the implement of their destruction also will serve as their savior.  Speaker for the Dead does tackle many moral issues: religion vs. truth, multi-species contact &amp; non-interference; however, it is not as &quot;deep&quot; of a book as Ender's game was and I found myself more drawn to it because the relationship that I had formed with Ender in Ender's Game then because of the plot events in this book.  If you've read Ender's Game, I doubt you'll be able to stay away from this book.  If you haven't yet: pick Ender's Game up first.  This book would spoil it for you and Ender's Game is clearly the better of the two!  But have no doubt, after reading Ender's Game, you'll be back!
0375707972|5.0|Love is supposed to be unconditional, then you find out that lover has been involved in tragic, dramatic crimes, which can hardly be explained. Then, is it wrong to love that person? Are the acts of a person the same thing as the person? If we can always be defined by our actions, and what we do is contradictory, then what are we? Can any one really judge anyone? And if we judge how do we really know that we are viewing the situation form a superior moral stand point? And if we can not judge, them how can we relate to life and others? How can we evolve as better persons without a before and after to compare? How do we know is better? Is someone who kill one thousand persons worst that a person who kill one? Why? Can really life be quantified?<br />The questions which that came to our mind are certainly not limited to these few, but the intensity of the work and its basic humanness will certainly touch your heart. Is just beautiful.
0451169514|5.0|Stephen King's book, &quot;IT&quot;, is to me about one word... friendship. Long lasting, undying, deep, gratifying, caring, heartfelt friendship. The kind of friendship that even if years pass without any real kind of contact, you can meet again and continue as if no time had passed at all. <br />The members of the &quot;Losers Club met under strange and sometimes dire circumstances but, formed a bond that could never be broken. They shared deep and sometimes frightening secrets. They looked after one another and stayed strong &quot;together&quot; fighting a supernatural inhuman evil being in &quot;Pennywise the Clown&quot; who wanted them dead.<br />&quot;IT&quot; had me very scared the three times I read the novel. How could it not? Werewolves chasing you while you race away on a bike. Horrid eerie voices coming from sewers and drains. Mummies and vampires and gigantic spiders. Maybe the worst is pictures in a photo album coming to life and trying to reach at you. Despite all it's horrors that can scare just about anyone, especially children, I found the kids growing attachment and need for one another, inspite of all their differences, most memorable. At times touching. Maybe the saddest truth of the novel is the &quot;growing up&quot; into adults and having lost your childhood innocence. <br />Stephen King definitely hit a homerun with this fictional horror, yet very real human story. I give it the highest recommendation.
0671042858|4.0|A great one by Stephen King.  It was sweet and to the point not all long and drawn out like King's books often are.  I read it in one day and loved it.  Trisha, a little girl lost in the woods off the Appalachian Trail, has to learn survival while trying to find a way out of the forest.  Her encounters are spooky and her thoughts terrifying.  It is a great and exciting read!
6302902010|5.0|I loved this movie growing up as a child.  I have trying for years to get a copy.  I've been telling my children about it for years, and we have seen another version on the pbs channel.  That doesn't even come close to the original.  Please if it ever comes out on VHS/DVD I want to be on that list.  Was it really destroyed, I've heard that before, if so, do you know why??
B00000IKSC|5.0|If you have never seen the BSB in conceert then this is the video to watch, whether you buy it or rent it (at a video rental place), you will definitely enjoy it.  The guys have great singing voices and great dance moves.  You really get the experience of watching the concert from a fans point of view.
0788811355|1.0|I'm with Elaine from &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in that I can't fathom the popularity or the acclaim heaped upon &quot;The English Patient.&quot;  It is a long, boring, and ultimately implausible waste of time.  A couple of points need to be made here.  One, do you think that the allies would have allowed a nurse and and an ulimited supply of drugs to stay with a single patient during the scarcity of wartime?  Two, the central love story that is supposed to be so poiniant ignores the fact that Kristen Scott Thomas's husband, who she cheats on with Ralph Feinnes, is actually a decent and likeably guy.  So right there I was inclined to dislike the two heroes and their love story.  Three, the sideplot with the nurse and the Indian solider is absolutely superflous.  And how can any war film be an epic without a single major battle scene?<br />Bottom line, &quot;The English Patient&quot; is the most overrated and overhyped &quot;serious&quot; film of the last decade.  Better had the Best Picture Oscar gone to a piece of junk like &quot;Independence Day&quot; which at least made no claim to being taken seriously.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Not being too much a fan of American music, I checked out this soundtrack mainly for one song, but first, I must say I'm impressed by the fact that Nicole and Ewan can sing so well. I thought they would have harsh, crass voices at first, but it looks like they've taken some lessons. My favorite song on the album is the second to last one, called Hindi Sad Diamonds. The first have is a remix of the popular Hindi song, &quot;Chamma Chamma&quot; from China Gate. I think the remix is quite cool, and I can hardly wait to see it picturized. Overall, a pretty good sountrack, especially those who like this type of music.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the most powerful works that Stevie has even done.  Her songwriting is stronger than ever and the musical arrangements on this CD are pure genius.  The beauty of Stevie Nicks is that not only is she one of the primary influences for women in rock, but she becomes influenced by her peers and admirers.  There are hints of Sheryl Crow, Patti Smith and Emmylou Harris in this CD along with her usual melodic gypsy fare.  This CD is a solid piece or work and anyone who appreciates great rock and roll like Stevie and her contemporaries (Tom Petty, Don Henley, etc.) will NOT be disappointed by this CD.  Stevie, thank you for continuing to inspire the rest of us with your magic.  Keep doin' that voodoo you do so well!
B00003OSSL|3.0|Two things are required to give this movie a chance at being worth while, if not excellent.  The first is accepting the movie's premise that the fact that one's spouse died while being unfaithful is potentially obsessing and worthy of cinematic exploration.  <br />The second is that Harrison Ford needs to be replaced in the leading role.  He simply does not have the acting skills or emotional range to make the cuckolded husband credible or sympathetic.  I'm not suggesting that this would have been a great movie had Al Pacino or Nick Nolte or (most interestingly) Daniel Day Lewis played Ford's part.  I'm saying that it might have had a chance.  In his numerous films to date Ford has demonstrated that he is capable two facial expressions: confusion and surprise, which he occasionally combines in to a third: looking dumb.  These three, which were quite sufficient for `Star Wars', `Indiana Jones' and even `Patriot Games', are not sufficient for a part that if it is work at all, must be played with great subtlety and precision.  <br />Kristin Scott Thomas puts in her usual highly professional, believable, and potentially moving performance, and at least half-a-dozen of the bit and supporting players are excellent, but they can't rescue this movie from the deadening effect of Ford's incompetence.  The mystery is how does he keep getting cast is parts that are so clearly beyond him.
B00004RFCM|5.0|This is one of the best DVD's we have! I love both discs, but I think that the second one is better than the first. With episodes like &quot;The Drought&quot;, &quot;The Baby Shower&quot;(Char:She stole my baby name Sam: You B----), and &quot;the Tortise and the Hare&quot; (It's Pink for girls!)should bring you delight. Perfect if you need a good laugh on a bad day. Along with The Simpsons, my favorite TV show.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This movie was made before my time so I'll try to give a short review for the younger viewer who's never seen it.  As you can see from the number of reviews it can be enjoyed on many levels, but I'll just focus on the visual aspects.  This is simply the most astonishing collage of images ever placed on film.  Few movies can compare to this because 99.9% of them are cheating, with fancy special effects and techno-wizardry.  You'll realize that once you see it!  I demand that you see this film just to appreciate the sheer effort and determination it took to make it.  And if you're looking for something to test out your new home theater, please look no further.  Gladiator is for wussies!
B000006045|5.0|This is one of the 10 records I'd have on a desert island with me....
B000056V73|5.0|Many people may underrate this film because it didn't win or get nominated for very many Oscars and it didn't hit it big in the box office. But ALMOST FAMOUS is probably the best movie of all time. It's humorous and heartwarming (and I'm a 17-year-old girl who wasn't even born yet in the 70s).<br />This story is basically about director/writer/producer Cameron Crowe's teenage life as a rock journalist for Rolling Stone magazine. William Miller is Crowe's alter-ego (newcomer, Patrick Fugit) who has to travel around the country with a fictional rock band named Stillwater and get an interview with them. Along the way, William learns about life, true love, how to have fun, and how to &quot;be cool&quot;.<br />Some people who actually lived through this time period may feel as though this film is unrealistic. Well, this is one person's view of the 70s and every other person has different experiences so of course you probably wouldn't think this is the kind of thing you did in the 70s. <br />The stand-out performances are the ones by Billy Crudup (Stillwater's lead guitarist, Russell Hammond), Kate Hudson (Penny Lane), Francis McDormand (Elaine Miller - William's overprotective mother), and of course, Patrick Fugit (William Miller). The supporting cast was excellent, too especially the girl who played Anita Miller, William's older sister, Jason Lee (Stillwater's lead singer), and Ana Paquin's character. Also, the guy who played Lester Bangs was great, as well.<br />ALMOST FAMOUS isn't just about Crowe's life as a rock writer: it's about rock 'n roll, sex, drugs, love, and everything that was great about the 70s. This is a timeless classic and if you have a great sense of humor and love everything or something about the 70s and don't want to see a movie with cheesy or corny parts, then this is definitely for you! Go buy or rent ALMOST FAMOUS and I know you won't regret it!
B00004Z459|1.0|Ok lets all admit that \\"Nu-Metal\\" Has become a joke of itself, just like grunge became in the 90's. Yes Nu Metal is the grunge of the 21st century, and its becoming unbearable. Its a trend, a mere fad, and hopefully it will die out soon. As soon as Fred Durst and CO. get super-stardom a million bands come out, and walk the walk and talk the talk, but its all cheesy. Whats worse this or 80's hair band rock? Dan.
6305127646|3.0|If the title and main character were named anything other than &quot;The Saint,&quot; you'd have a great action movie. However, in regard to the modern day Robin Hood character created by authour Leslie Charteris (who is not mentioned ANYWHERE in the credits AT ALL.....) in the late 1920's, the only &quot;Saintly&quot; tie-ins are: Roger Moore's voice-over at the end of the film (the original TV Saint), A Volvo coupe (although not white), the trademark stickman pin, and Orbital's update of the Saint Theme.  Everything else, right down to The Saint's origins, have little to do with the character.  I did like the movie, but after reading so many of the stories, I prefer the RKO films of the 30's / 40's and the TV series with Roger Moore (re-issued on DVD and VHS) as a closer comparison to The Saint character. A good flick, just not the Saint.....
B00003CXA3|1.0|Why did it win  5 oscars? With a main character that never stops to think about anyone else. A soundtrack so intense it hurts you ears. Half the dialogue is shouting or arguing!<br />Half the film seems to be set either in their car following somebody, or them walking about - still following somebody. The car chase is OK, but it's so long it loses any intesity it ever had!<br />Overall it's an OK film, butexpect anything amazing.
0780619609|5.0|This movie is fun for everyone!  It has enough humor and action to keep anyone in one spot for an hour.  The movie gives you just the right information so that you don't have to be TMNT groupie.  Also Vanilla Ice adds ton of excitement to this hot flick!
044022165X|4.0|I must say I enjoyed reading John Grisham's novel, The Rainmaker.  Of all the Grisham novels I have had the pleasure of reading, it is my favorite.  He does an excellent job of portraying the lowly everyday working man who never loses sight of his dream despite obstacles. <br />The protagonist, Rudy Baylor, is a poor rookie lawyer who seems to always get shafted.  Grisham presents many subplots to keep his reader guessing as to which direction the novel will go.  The beginning reminds me of a soap opera, in that it bounces from scene to scene leaving loose ends full of suspense.<br />While participating in a class project, Rudy happens upon a woman whose child was diagnosed with leukemia.  Their insurance company refuses to cover the cost of a bone marrow transplant that would save the boy's life.  As a law student, Rudy is instructed to develop their case.  Additionally, Grisham has Rudy involved in a case dealing with a widow, Ms. Birdie, who presumes that her estate is worth millions.  Acting on that presumption, she has Rudy disinherit her children in her will due to their lack of interst and care for her.  Once Grisham reveals that Ms. Birdie does not have the money that she claims, it becomes obvious that the case against Great Benefit Insurance Company will be the focus of the novel.  Much like other Grisham novels, the story begins to get predictable.  The pace and excitement slows to a near halt.<br />At this point, the novel changes direction from suspense to drama, though it continues to be equally enjoyable.  After Rudy overcomes many obstacles throughout the novel, Grisham develops a character who triumphs over a corporate giant through a string of lucky breaks.<br />Grisham succeeds in having the reader become a part of this masterpiece.  I felt as though I was experiencing, first-hand,  what Rudy was going through.  It is truly a work of art that I recommend for reading.
1559408898|2.0|An avid fan of Robocop, I was really excited when I finally found and bought the Criterion Collection of this classic sci-fi film.  Unfortunately, upon watching it, I was very disappointed.  The main reason I was disappointed was that the extra footage that was cut from the theatrical release brings their respective scenes down rather than enhance them.  My main concern was for the editorial flow of the scenes, which was hampered by the added shots of violence.  Unlike the director's cut of Natural Born Killers, for example, these added shots of strong violence seem to have just been thrown back into scenes that already worked very well on their own.  There was apparently no sound re-editing, because the scenes feel VERY rough in terms of audio, and you can even hear where certain sounds are looped in order to fill the newfound soundtrack gaps in the extended scenes.  The print quality of the new shots doesn't match the original cut shots as well, and in terms of the editorial flow of the scenes, the new material just drags them down more than anything else.  On top of these things, the new footage really doesn't add much to the story at all.  The meaning the filmmakers were intending to create (which is expressed in the commentary section of the DVD) with the ultra-violence was already apparent to me with the theatrical version.  This DVD would be great if both versions of the film were included.  I'm going to sell this one and get the theatrical release version.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This really as an essential CD for those collecting pure samples of American music.  And for those of you that aren't, it's just a whole lot of fun! Personal favorites: The Ballad of John Henry's Hammer, Green Green Grass of Home, and 25 Minutes To Go.  Besides those, they really are all good. Tremendous liner notes as well.
0345404475|4.0|Expect the typical PKD: whacked-out ideas, clunkly writing, and a great heart.  The movie is maybe 20% of the book, and in fact one could make a case that the movie has almost zilch to do with the novel, since it fails to address the two huge ideas in the book: Mercerism (a religion that offers shared group experience) and animals (cheap machine-made fakes vs. expensive, rare live).  The actual elimination of the androids takes maybe 10 pages total, if that, but of course, a faithful adaptation probably would have taken twice the time/budget.  Then again, maybe Ridley Scott didn't pick up the Mercerism thread because it wasn't really fully developed.    I would rate this book lower than PKD's masterpieces, like the Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch or Ubik, but it's still plenty worth your time.  It shouldn't take any longer than 3-4 hours to finish this book, and I'm a pretty slow reader.
B00005176F|4.0|Blur is probably the best rock band today (please don't try to mention Oasis, who makes the Beatles 30 years to late!). This double CD album shows a very intelegent band, who can do almost every style in rock music - from the 60's (There's no other way) to Nirvana (Song 2) - and to add it their unique interpatation. No need to write much about the first CD, that is a fine collection. The second includes live performance from Wembly stadium, and i found it a little boring. They did'nt try to make something new with the old material, and just &quot;brought&quot; the studio to the stadium. Only &quot;Tender&quot; sounds better in the live CD. So in my opinion, they could do much better, and as i believe - they will.
B000059ZLH|2.0|Although it's great to finally have a Dream Theater DVD, this one falls down in several areas:<br />1. 4:3 aspect ratio - it should offer a widescreen (16:9) option 2. Dolby 2.0 - it should offer a 5.1 option DD or DTS 3. Too much ugly animation and video effects (the background graphics arn't good!!) - I actually felt that the video effects distracted me from the concert. 4. Building on point #3, there was far too much camera jumping - the video didn't spend more than a couple seconds ona single camera angle 5. No multiple camera angles - I realize this is an expensive feature, but it would definately solve the problem of #4 6. Building on point #5, I would really appreciate a camera angle that showed the entire stage so I could really watch the whole concert 7. What's with the deleted scenes on the DVD?  Why didn't they reproduce the concert in it's entirety?<br />In summary, while I appreciate DT's effort to produce a true \\"Concept\\" video, Scenes from New York doesn't live up to my expectations.  For a comparison, watch Queensryche's Operation Livecrime - this is a great example of how a \\"concept\\" video should be produced.
B00005B6C9|4.0|Universal sat on this album for quite awhile before it was finally released, and it's easy to see why--on &quot;Where I Came In,&quot; the Bee Gees show signs of breaking free from the lazy MOR schlock mode that earned them a gold certification for their last effort. Stylistically, this album doesn't venture anyplace the Bee Gees haven't already been over the course of their long career; however, it's still eclectic enough to give fits to Universal's clueless A&amp;R department.<br />There's some good stuff here: longtime fans will be pleased to note an increased presence on the part of Robin, who was virtually missing from &quot;Still Waters,&quot; and Maurice pops up for two lead vocal turns instead of his usual one. On the whole, &quot;Where I Came In&quot; has a more organic feel than pretty much anything they've done since &quot;One&quot;--the ridiculous &quot;Voice In The Wilderness&quot; notwithstanding.<br />Gripes: I could have done without the shrill &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot;--and what's with the European version's best track, &quot;Just In Case,&quot; being left off the U.S. edition?
0345360338|4.0|I loved Here Be Dragons, the first of this series of books because of its humanity.  I admire this book deeply and often read it with some dread, knowing the ominous end that characters were going to come to.  Its characters are both larger than life and sometimes less than human, and it is a very &quot;male&quot; book.  (This is certainly not meant to be an insult.)  I had not had much knowledge of Simon de Montfort prior to reaidng this, and I was very impressed with his story and how it connects up with the legend of Robin Hood and the stirrings of the political strength of the common man in England.  I also, as several reviewers have noted, was horrified and moved by Penman's unflinching handling of anti-Semitism.  She shows the struggle of genuinely good men dealing with the deep-seated cultural constructs of their times, and that is an important lesson for all of us.
B00004RYZT|4.0|Ive seen several music dvd's in my day but have to bow down to Rammstein for the work they've done to bring us \\"Live Aus Berlin\\". As an avid concert/music fan, i have to say that while being unfortunate in that ive never seen them live, this dvd has made sure ill catch them on their next tour. The show is a performance in itself with the pyrotechnics like youve never seen before(scenes include rockets shot into the air, Till setting himself on fire, flamethrowers, huge spotlights, an industrial metal fan)....and all of this is done without making the show.....cheesey.<br />The music is pure Rammstein, Heavy, Raw with a techno beat to keep you firmly planted in the new millenium. Unlike hair metal bands of the 80's and 90's, rammstein supasses the ministry's and NIN's of the world by giving us more raw, heavy guitar riffs which take me back to the sabbath of yesteryear. I was surprsied that the audio was as good as it was as a lot of concert dvds and videos lack a clear sound but this was like listening to them on a record. Make sure youhave surround sound and watch this in the dark for full effects. The extra features were cool with interviews of the band and the songs with subtitles in german....although an english feature wouldve been nice too.<br />All in all for $..... bucks.....you cant go wrong. <br />Buy it  watch it and Rock on!
B00005JG6Q|5.0|This is it, the best animation quality ever, by a huge margin.  The only other feature to come close is Ghost in the shell, which had a better story, and focussed on mood and art more. Featuring unparalleled fluidity in both the in-focus actor and the background elements, Akira seems to have a higher frame rate than other animation. I first heard of it in Germany, where, at the time, no one over twelve was caught dead watching cartoons, this one was different though, on par in its acceptance by the in-crowd with Blade-Runner.This is not a film reserved for geeks or guys who are still into Transformers. Akira is for the intelligent movie connoisseur. In Japan Akira enjoys an almost religious following. It is for animated movies what Bob Marley is for Reggae.  For readers of this critique the only word of caution is that it is a movie that is not as simple as what we get in the US.
0553106635|4.0|First of all, let me say that I read this book with insane abandon for a week and a half.  I am very happy with this series, and this author, for the same reasons as the other 300 or so people who have written reviews, so I won't bore you with the details.  So why the 3 star review, and not five? 1.  The plot is exceedingly depressing.  Everyone says that Martin writes realistically (or at least as close as possible in a fantasy series), but I really don't think so.  The fact is, good guys don't ALWAYS finish last.  If you trust your friends and try to do the right thing, you don't always get hanged for it.  I know there are some bitter people who like to walk through life thinking that way, but the plain fact is it's not true.  In this series, everyone with any shred of honor and compassion is brutally--and I mean BRUTALLY--dealt with.  By the end of the book, I had only one character I could still root for.  I seriously doubt he'll survive the next book. 2.  Not too sure what the main plot is yet.  I mean, is it the fight with the Others in the North, or the struggle for the Iron Throne?  On one hand, I think it's amazing that he shows us how human concerns often get in the way when we SHOULD be dealing with something more important.  After all, the Monica Lewisky trial got more coverage on U.S. television than the Taliban's brutal takeover of Afghanistan.  On the other hand, IT'S A BOOK.  I need some sort of plot. That's my spiel.  Outstanding series so far, but I swear to god if another good guy gets hacked to pieces or paralyzed I'm quitting.
0679777547|4.0|This book is essentially a Gothic parody with two parallel stories in one - the main character feels like his adventure is playing itself out like a written story and he becomes unsure of what is real and what is imaginary. It also underscores Napoleon's battle at Waterloo and draws comparisons with the main character's trial and tribulations.<br />The plot really doesn't pick up until about halfway through the book when the main character, Corso, goes to Portugal. Then it becomes hard to put down! The plot is twisted, riveting and unexpected. Overall, a well thought out mystery. The writing style is intellectual and can be a bit intimidating (he uses a lot of French and Latin quotes) but the author's explanation is good and he supplies you with very helpful literary history within the connect of the story itself.<br />The characters are well described but are a bit dramatic and unbelievable, especially the mystery girl, Irene Adler. Still, I felt they fit in very well with the feel of the book. An interesting observation: the characters were almost old-fashioned. Except for a couple of times where a computer was mentioned, it was almost impossible to date the story except to say it was in the 20th century. The images in my head were from the black and white movies from the 1950's , maybe starring Humphrey Bogart and some young vixen.<br />If you like mysteries and enjoy reading stories based in a European setting with characters to match, then this is a good story to read!
0451191153|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is the kind of book that will change your life and one that you will always remember. It will make you a better person.  I would recommend it to anyone. It is long, but well worth it.  I was sorry when I was finished reading it and closed the cover for the last time.  The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are the kind of books everyone should read at least once in their life times.  I plan to read it again in a few years.
0060196122|3.0|If you have read Coelho's more famous novel, The Alchemist, and are expecting a similar read, you will be disappointed. Although still a good read, the book is nowhere near as involved. The plot and the characters are very straightforward. There were a couple of plot twists but hardly any surprises. Imagery wasn't abundant but at least it seemed to be the right amount and the characters were well-balanced. Not a horrible waste-of-time but I just expected more from Coelho.<br />One piece of advice if you want to read it... wait for the paperback. The story is too short of a read (it's really a novella) to spend your money on the hardback.
B000003TSP|5.0|Portishead is a name that I have been more than happy to hear, speak and write of for barely more than a year. The group and their releases, especially this self-titled one, are fantastic.<br />Beth Gibbons has a very nice vocal range and can imitate Shirley Bassey quite well. The music itself blends rock-and-roll and trip-hop quite nicely with modern and nostalgic pop.<br />The material is a delight for those with eclectic musical tastes. Not too American (Boy bands, teeny boppers, overplayed secon-rate rap artists, etc.), not too British (in the sense of trying to bring back the '60s).<br />As a hint, if you enjoy artists such as POE, Mono, Pink Floyd, Massive Attack, and the best stuff from the James Bond 007 Soundtracks, then this is a must-have!
B000008H1Y|5.0|There is no musician quite like Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson. He is unique, and this album is one of the greatest achievements in the massive Jethro Tull catalogue. To say that this is Tull's \\"folk album\\" or their \\"Celtic album\\" is to diminish it with by assigning it a trite label for easy reference. Admittedly, Ian and the rest of Tull draw upon English folklore, pastoral themes, and exotic acoustic instruments, but the result is unlike anything anyone else has done before or since. <br />Listen to the title track, for example, with the group joining Anderson on the merry vocals, combined with instrumental passages that boast startling, thrilling changes in time signatures that whisk the listener along... Folk music? Peter, Paul and Mary (great as they are) were never like this! It's not Aerosmith either, thankfully. It does conjure visions of Celtic mythology, of creatures of England's woodlands, from the jiggy tune \\"The Whistler\\" to the epic \\"Pibroch (Cap In Hand),\\" that offers Martin Barre's electric guitars emulating Highland bagpipes and solos featuring Ian Anderson's trademark, swirling flute... <br />Pastoral and challenging. Relaxing and exhilerating. This is Jethro Tull music - there's no other label for it. It is all the more remarkable to consider that this album was written and recorded in 1977, when disco and punk were the trend-setting musical styles. That's why this is timeless music, as relevent in 2001 as it would have been in 1977, 1777, or 1077. A classic.
B0000067X1|5.0|This is a classic.... No other way to put it.  It is on my top 20 all-time list.  Of course, Holger is a friend so you might say I'm a bit prejudice, but CAN was on my favorite list long before I met the mad-capped bass player in this lineup which included Damo.  The &quot;free-form&quot; approach adopted by CAN is quite evident in this release.  Sit back..... enjoy the head rush...
B00000JFV9|5.0|IF you even need someone to tell you who Curtis is, or what's special about this album, then you must have been living on MARS<br />There has yet to be produced, and most likely never will be, a more perfect soundtrack for any movie. Period. Unlike todays soundtracks, not only does it follow the theme of the movie throughout, but the music is OTHERWORLDLY in it's funkiness, songwriting, producing, and arranging. <br />Curtis hits the peak like Roy Ayers did with &quot;Coffy&quot;.  Even the instrumental tracks have exciting, breathtaking arrangements.<br />Many an artist have borrowed LIBERALLY from the genius of Curtis Mayfield, whose crossover appeal has seen him copied, and sampled by everyone from A to Z.  This is a SEMINAL album that has, and will continue to go down in the ANNALS of Music History - Listen to the ORIGINAL, the real deal, the ONE AND ONLY CURTIS MAYFIELD
B00005BJ2O|1.0|At first glance, this looks like it could be a great CD. You've got new songs by David Bowie, Fatboy Slim, Bono, Beck, Rufus Wainwright, and Massive Attack. Sounds cool, right? Upon closer examination of the CD, you'll notice songs by Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, and John Leguizamo. The last I heard, these three were actors--not musicians. This disc reconfirms that in no uncertain terms. It's a classic example of the &quot;looks good on paper, but don't ever listen to this CD&quot; syndrome. Sure, there's some major talent here--the problem lies in the material. <br />Bowie redefines boring with his track, &quot;Nature Boy,&quot; and its reprise with Massive Attack is no better. Speaking of Bowie, Beck covered one of the great Bowie tunes, &quot;Diamond Dogs.&quot; I had been hearing about this track for months before its release and had high expectations for it. Unfortunately, Beck's pseudo hip-hop take on the song is little more than interesting and not anything you need to hear more than once. The best track on the Moulin Rouge soundtrack is the cover of the T.Rex classic, &quot;Children of the Revolution.&quot; <br />Pop fans will love the 'new' Christina Aguilera track, &quot;Lady Marmalade.&quot; Anyone who's heard the original version by LaBelle (whether they like it or not) will be lunging for the 'next track' button when this one comes on. Then there are the medleys. Once you hear these, you'll be wondering how they ever made it onto the CD. The worst is the &quot;Elephant Love Medley.&quot; But wait--there's more! How about &quot;El Tango de Roxanne?&quot; What was Sting thinking when he gave the OK for this? He can't be that desperate for cash. <br />The bottom line is this--even if you're a fan of any of the artists mentioned here, there's no reason to waste your hard-earned money on this disc. Your worst enemies don't deserve anything this bad.
B000059MEK|5.0|I am so relieved that Daft Punk managed to bring out this album and show the music industry that they could go beyond &quot;Homework&quot;. This album is slightly different; some of the tracks are a bit of a departure from their previous album, towards a style that sounds a little like Phoenix or Air. If you enjoyed Homework or Air's Moon Safari, you'll definitely like this...
B000059Z8J|4.0|Of course, the movie is as awesome as ever.  However, after seeing the movie on video and laser 100 times since 1980, it was very disappointing to NOT HEAR the loud &quot;metal-hitting-metal&quot; noise as Superman grabs onto the falling helicopter.  Also missing is the exterior &quot;jet noise&quot; as the scene changes from the cockpit to the exterior of Superman. Another disappointment was the deletion of the scene where he rescues &quot;Ms. Tess&quot; from the lions at the end.

1577311523|5.0|This book is a valuable reminder and a restatement of many perennial insights shared by many of the world's religions.  The most important of which, is perhaps that suffering in fact has an end.  A fact that I, for one, too often refuse to believe.<br />As an example of Mr. Tolle's direct style, here is how he states this Good News: &quot;Humankind as a whole has been through such vast suffering that one could almost say that every human has suffered enough now. No further suffering is necessary.&quot;<br />Another book as direct and powerful in its perennial insight as this one is &quot;The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment&quot; by Thaddeus Golas.<br />Personally, I see such books as valuable documents of the spontaneous experience of awakening.  But whether or not such an experience is any more or less contagious via the medium of these books as opposed to any of the more traditional practices - e.g. singing in choir, taking communion, or sitting on a cushion at 5 a.m. - is pretty dubious, it seems to me.  <br />&quot;Frying sesame seeds ... One pops.&quot; - Mitsu Suzuki
B000053V7Q|2.0|In another classic example of RCA/MGM's attempts to give fans only portions of songs and performances, this DVD, while adding new concert footage, also cuts several songs from the original film. Why? You have to feel somewhat insulted by the fact that the DVD version still features a nervous Elvis talking about forgetting the lyrics to &quot;I Just Can't Help Believin',&quot; and then doesn't include the song! It's almost insulting.<br />We all know DVD is capable of much longer footage, yet this release barely outruns the original. Even songs that are included in the original are cut for this version, such as the shortened and sadly missing &quot;Hut-two-three-four, I learned that in the army&quot; seque in &quot;Polk Salad Annie.&quot; They could have included everything here, they simply chose not to. Probably so that a &quot;special, special edition&quot; can be released later, or for a new product named &quot;Elvis Live In Las Vegas,&quot; for which we'll all have to shell out another $...<br />Put this together with the original concert footage, include the original version on Side 2 of the DVD (which they're perfectly capable of doing) and you've got something. But why do that when they figure no one will know the difference?
B00003CXN4|3.0|I went to the theatre before the Oscars to see Traffic, I came out liking the moving but as the days wore on after the Oscars, I see why it was not the Best Picture.  The moving did not tell anything that anyone does not know about the usage and affects of drugs on all participants all around.  The one thing that it did shed light on is a cop who was not compromised by money and that is not something you see everyday (del Toro's oscar winning performance, deservedly).  Other than that, it was predictable.  What pulled this movie off was the performances from Michael Douglas, the girl who played his daughter (she was very good), Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, on down the line....and one other thing, I am glad of the way Soderburgh used the lighting for each story intertwined, very good effect.  I am disappointed that for over $20 you do not get any commentary from the director, actor or writer....for this I may wait for the special edition release.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is a great cd, a classic grunge album and will always be a great breakthrough album for grunge/alt rock.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|After hearing the soundtrack to &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, I am very excited to see the film.  I love a wide variety of music (you might call my taste &quot;eclectic&quot; or &quot;all over the place&quot;), so this album is right up my alley.  On what other single disc can you enjoy standards, pop/rock, techno, soul and Indian-influenced sounds?  <br />My favorites are Fatboy Slim's insanely catchy &quot;Because We Can&quot;, Nicole Kidman's fun and sassy &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot; (a combination of &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; and &quot;Material Girl&quot;), Ewan McGregor's lovely rendition of &quot;Your Song&quot;, the entrancing &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot; and the &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot;.  The last, a medley of ten love songs (from &quot;All You Need is Love&quot; to &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; to &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;) manages to be both moving and campy at the same time.<br />Despite the vocal stylings of Christina &quot;I love the sound of my own voice&quot; Aguilera, &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; is fun, although I do prefer LaBelle's original version.  Aguilera could take some lessons in sincere vocal delivery from Ewan McGregor.  But, hey, if &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; gets people to buy and listen to the whole album, I'm all for it.<br />I've had this album for a week and can't stop listening to it.  I played it for my parents and they loved it, too!  There is truly something here for everyone.  Buy it now...because you can-can-can!
B00004XOWM|4.0|Fair enough, The &quot;Bizkit&quot; had made a huge impact on the music world. Lets face facts they practicly DID create Nu-Metal (round of applause. But with this, something died in Limp Bizkit, although album 4 is set to resurrect the Limp Bizkit we knew and loved in the days of &quot;3 Dollar Bill Y'all&quot; and &quot;Significant Other&quot;. The fiery, angry, raw edge of tracks of old such as &quot;Break Stuff&quot;, &quot;Pollution&quot;, &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Counterfeit&quot; and &quot;Nookie&quot; has been lowered down to a mere tinkle. <br />It seems that pop has invaded Fred Durst's sub-concious and made him dumb the act down a bit. Don't get me wrong, the album rocks! But not in the same way as before. Only tracks such as &quot;Full Nelson&quot;, &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Hot Dog&quot; survive the aftermath that pop has ensued on the band. One can only assume that this is just a fad and will soon pass. <br />But on a lighter note, the album DOES show the groups more creative side, with a lot more than just raw anger being used to fuel the lyrics, even a dedication to Mystery Man, Ben Stiller himself manages to sneak in there. Plus cameos from Xzibit, Method Man, Redman and DMX add to the Rap/Rock phenomenon.<br />To end, what can I say? If you loved them before, expect a change, but don't hesitate to give it a try. If you have already done so and decided the album's no good, wait for album 4 it'll blow you away (apparently!!)
B00003CXS4|5.0|Guy Ritchie has come up with another winner.  This film has a stronger story line than Lock Stock and 2 smoking barrels but the film is not Part 2.   It is a story in it's own right.  This gives a good view on life in the East End of London.  The array of different people from various walks of life is what makes this film stand out.  Brad Pitt is brillant as the Irish streetfighter Mickey.  With so many twists to the story you'll need to follow the story closely.  The language is strong but without it would have made the story unrealistic .  This is East End, London and the big boys have come out to play, even the amercians fly over to join in !. Sit back and enjoy another Guy Richie classic.
0618135871|5.0|Roth's narrator, David Kopesh, writes this 156-page, terse, gem-etched novel in an essay style to express his anguish of experiencing raw lust as a misdirected form of longing for a kind of transcendence to fill the emptiness of his soul. A sixty-two-year-old lit professor, cultural critic, and minor celebritiy, Kopesh uses his privilege to seduce the youngest, most beautiful women in the world, students, groupies, sycophants. What elevates this story...is the context of competing social forces in the American psyche, the forces of hypersexuality vs. the forces of anti-sexuality. It appears that Kopesh's despair is that the more he seeks religious experience and fulfillment through sexual ecstasy the more empty, vulnerable, and discombobulated he becomes. He does not preach for or against the sexual revolution; rather, he shows the wreckage of his life as a sort of casualty of the sexual revolution, which promised freedom, happiness, and fulfillment through unlimited access to orgasms. A highly readable novel. What makes Roth such a major writer is that too many writers of his caliber waste everyone's time by blowing smoke up our butts while Roth speaks the truth in his own eloquent style.
0679409998|4.0|Frankenstein is said to be one of the best books ever written and it has been proven time and time again.  The story will scare you only if you can really get into it and you can understand everything that is going on while you are reading it.  If you get lost while reading the book you will be lost through the rest of the book.  It is interesting that Victor Frankenstein can come up with an idea to bring something to life by using old body parts.  Mary Shelly had to have had some inspiration to come up with an idea like this one.  Frankenstein has some realistic parts to it that make it more believable.  This novel shows how grotesque people can be treated when they are out in the real world.  Although Frankenstein did deserve what he got because he did not treat people good.  It becomes quite sad that Victor and Frankenstein both follow each other scared to see what is going to happen next.  Victor has to follow Frankenstein around and put his own life on hold.  He cannot get married when he wants to and that is something that should not wait for anyone.  Victor should not have been blamed for the murder when no one in the town knew anything about the story.  There are people who go in and out of towns all of the time who can say that it was not a common bum.  Although the out come is very good with all of the stress that the characters have to go through while this story is taken place.  With the descriptions that Mary Shelly uses and the imaginations that people have this novel is a perfect way to expand ones mind.  The movie follows the book pretty well although you can only watch Mary Shelly's Frankenstein.  All of the other movies that show Frankenstein do not even come close to the real thing.  When one first watches the movie or reads the book ones opinion on Frankenstein will really change.
0195073401|5.0|Going through a Ph.D. education in economics can be a risky investment. Unless you build on strong foundations the whole thing will fall apart as soon as you get out of graduate school, no matter how fancy your dissertation was. This book provides you with the fundamental tools you need to do research and teach when you become a full-time researcher and professor, in any branch of economics, either applied or theoretical. Even if you dont apply them at this rigorous level, you will always know if you are doing something wrong just by checking the basics in this book. It also provides you with the common language economists speak all over the world, regardless ideological points of view. It is the stuff we all agree with, and the starting point of any future development in our discipline. However, if you are not planning to become a professor but a professional (a practitioner economist) better turn to Milton Friedman's Price Theory for sound intuition on how to tackle the even more difficult real-world problems.
0790736233|5.0|Jodie Foster plays a scientist who is bent on discovering life on other planets. But when experimenting with a machine, she is caught in some sort of space warp, sending her down in a multicolored worm hole. She stops and she is suddenly on a beautiful planet, reminscient of Earth, where she meets her supposedly &quot;deceased&quot; father. She talks to him, never believing that he was alive or that he was an alien. I won't reveal the end, but it is stunning, more beautifully filmed than &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; or &quot;Cast Away,&quot; a perfect, beautiful adaptation of Sagan's 1980s novel. Jodie Foster and Robert Zemeckis should have won Oscars for making an incredible science-fiction/drama movie like this. Wonderful and engaging. Rated PG for language and some sexual content.

B00004YW6I|5.0|I own 3 of PJ's cds, and this one is probably my favorite.  I just saw her in concert and open for U2-- she was phenomenal and even better live.  Very loud and emotional, just like she is.   She still shows raw emotion and a hard attitude, but at some points, like in the song a place called home, sounds a little happy.  The cd starts out with &quot;Big Exit&quot;, which was her final song in the concert, and was really awesome.  She shouts &quot;I wanna pistol, I Wanna Gun, i'm scared baby, give me the gun&quot;... its a great song. i hated the first time but i came to love.  Good Fortune, the next track, sounds like something sheryl crow might do, but is definately for polly jean.  Its a great catchy and addictive song.  A place called home is more happy, a song about a relationship she thinks that they can make it through. it goes on to a couple of other songs which are very good, into some of the best tracks on the album, the breathtaking duet with PJ and Thom Yorke, playing distant lovers. I am a huge radiohead fan, and thom sounds really good.  My favorite song on the album is definately &quot;You said Something&quot;, which i think could be a big hit. it has a great guitar riff in it, and wonderful vocals.  Its just a really good song.  Just about every song on this album is good, and digs deep into her emotions, just like on her other albums.   If you like this one, check out to bring you my love, my other favorite. that one is even more raw and at times haunting.  Also-dont mind the parental advisory on this cd. it doesnt have much- just a few gun references and few sexual references.   If you liked my review, click the &quot;was this review helpful to you&quot; icon.  thanks!!

044022165X|5.0|In the book, The Rainmaker, the author, John Grisham, skillfully presents a case of good versus evil. The main character, Rudy Baylor, is a struggling law student trying to make it in life.  With no job and no place to live, he stumbles onto a case that will either bring him fame or ultimate failure.  In this case, Baylor is up against professional, smart, and crafty lawyers.  The lawyers and the rest of the society are both impressed when the inexperienced Baylor crushes them in the courtroom.<br /> Hollywood has created the typical story line for a story.  The hero always ends up winning.  Well Grisham diverts and steers to and from the typical.  Readers are kept interested because they do not always know what is going to happen next.  There is even a murder drama placed in the already exciting world.  Baylor and his girlfriend, Kelly, go to her old apartment to get some of her clothes.  \\"I place the car, and take a deep breath.  `Are you scared?' she asks.  `Yes.'  I reach under the seat and get the gun\\"  (Grisham 412).  To make matters worse, they meet up with Kelly's abusive ex-husband.  There is a struggle and in the end, only Baylor and Kelly stand.  Towards the conclusion of the book, there are two great endings.  In the courtroom, there is an overwhelming victory.  \\"We the jury, find for the plaintiff and award actual damages in the amount of two hundred thousand dollars...  And we the jury find for the plaintiff and award punitive damages in the amount of fifty million dollars\\"  (Grisham 402).  The second happy ending in the book comes at the end.  Baylor and Kelly, leave together.  \\"We smile and giggle as the land flattens and the traffic lightens.  Memphis is twenty miles behind us.  I vow never to return\\"  (Grisham 434).  With the thrilling scenes and interesting details, Grisham's book comes to life as everything unfolds perfectly in time.<br /> Many people have praised The Rainmaker.  One critic has written, \\"The case against the insurance company isa classic David vs. Goliath scenario. Mr. Grisham expertly weaves all these plot lines together and keeps the pages turning with bright, vivid and entertaining writing\\"  (Thomas Magnum).  This critic is correct.  Readers learn throughout the book that perseverance always wins.  Baylor, the inexperienced lawyer, gives inspiration to the little people in the world trying to make it in life.  In classic Good vs. Evil cases, the outcome usually leans towards the good.  Although this is known, Grisham exemplifies his great ability of writing and guides readers on a journey that leads to reality.

0679721037|4.0|On August 6, 1945, in a final attempt to end World War II, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The novel Hiroshima, by John Hersey, tells the story of six survivors of the bombing. The novel demonstrates that, in life there are those who suffer and drown in the pain, and those who suffer but rise to the occasion and show greatness in times of need.  The author shows the reader that suffering and struggling for survival or \\"stepping up\\" in a difficult time are two human conditions that are valid both historically and today.  Hersey wrote that following the explosion of the bomb, \\"They reported that 78,150 people had been killed, 13,983 were missing, and 37,425 had been injured.\\" (103) Although these statistics seem extremely daunting, this novel doesn't focus on all of the deceased, but focuses on the stories of six of the strong and lucky who survived. For example, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young surgeon, was one of the only doctors to survive the tragedy.  Without the use of his own glasses, he took care of thousands of victims and didn't sleep for long periods of time so he could assist those who were injured. Similarly, Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto, the pastor of the Hiroshima Methodist church, went to a park and brought water to those suffering and transported them to refuge across a river by way of a boat that Tanimoto, himself, took back and forth.  His goal was to help as many people as he possibly could.  Both men selflessly worked to save the lives of numerous other citizens. Similarly, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge was a German priest who tried to help one of the other priests who was dying. While he helped only a single person survive, in the scheme of things, one life can truly make a difference. The other three characters, Dr. Masakazu Fuji, Miss. Toshika Sasaki, and Mrs. Hastuyo Nakamura all struggled to survive and fought through their own intense pain to survive. Mrs. Nakamura did everything possible to save herself and the lives of her children, who she loved dearly. All six characters display the will to survive and to help those in need.  Even though the novel focuses primarily on six stories of people who survive, it also gives attention to those who die because they don't have the will or they are helpless and cannot survive grave injuries. Also, it is important to remember that in the case of an atomic bomb, some were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. For example, a man named Mr. Fukai, was being helped away from the fires by Father Kleinsorge, and ran back into the disasters to die because he did not have the will and the power to survive. Also, as Dr. Sasaki was helping patients, all of those hopelessly injured, laid on the ground and just moaned Doctor! Doctor! but could not help themselves. One man was said to have been tearing down his own home because \\"it lay in the path of an air-raid-defense fire lane, when the bomb hit and wrecked it anyway. This is just the case of a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hence, fate may be more significant than will.Unfortunately, many people were \\"in the wrong place at the wrong time\\" when the bomb hit Hiroshima, which is why there were so many victims and so few survivors. The six characters who did survived may have been lucky, but they also had the overwhelming desire and will to live. The true hero is someone who rises up in a time of need. In this novel, some of the main characters definitely displayed this type of heroic behavior and were outstanding human beings because of it. One would suggest that those who do not drown in pain but rather fight through it are the ones who make a difference. Today, even though there are few many bombs being dropped, some people still exemplify the will to survive while others suffer and crumble with the pain. The novel, Hiroshima, displays these human conditions beautifully.

Ender's Game is a great book and I recomend it to anyone who enjoys a good science-fiction novel.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Loved it!!!   Wished more people would see it before judging it.  Am giving everyone I know DVDs of this movie for Father's Day!
B00003CXE7|1.0|I recently purchased a DVD Player, and choose Gladiator as my first DVD movie purchase. I will be the first to admit I did not understand the technical factors involving aspect ratios and their final effect on the viewing size of the movie on my television. I currently own a 35 inch 4/3 aspect ratio television, and I expected to see a full screen version when viewing this movie. Instead, I was presented with a &quot;ribbon&quot; of a picture, barely 13 inchs high, on a screen capable of showing nearly 29 inchs of vertical picture.  I owe my thanks to anamorphic widescreen 2.35 to 1 technology. I did not enjoy the movie, due primarily to eye strain trying to watch it.  What is the purpose of having a 35 inch TV if you are forced to watch a &quot;ribbon&quot; of a movie on it with no options for a different format, such as &quot;letterbox&quot; at 1.77 to 1 or even full screen at 1.33 to 1. If this is a veiled attempt to move me to the purchase of a new widescreen HDTV, it is a failed attempt. According to my calculations, a widescreen TV with a 16/9 aspect ratio would still not format Gladiator at full screen, thanks to  the 2.35 to 1 aspect ratio of the DVD. I do not intend to purchase any additional DVD's that provide only the 2.35 to 1 ratio. Thanks to anamorphic widescreen 2.35 to 1 technology, I will continue to watch my movies in VHS format.

0679777547|4.0|Being a big fan of Arturo Perez-Reverte, I was slightly disappointed it \\"The Club Dumas\\".  Mr. Perez-Reverte has just as good a plot and characters in this book, as in his other books.  The ending is what I have a bone to pick with, I thought it was vague, after reading it twice I'm still not sure what was going to happen.  Now this might just be me and the mood I was in when I finished it.  The plot was full of twist and turns.  The author interwove about four different story lines into a wonderful book.  His characters are well developed and used very well to move the story along.  I was totally engrossed in what was happening the entire time that I read it.  One thing I will say about the characters is that there is not one that is totally likable.  I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, the hero Corso is worth rooting for.  \\"The Club Dumas\\" is an intellectual read, but fun.  I just would have liked a little bit better ending.
038533348X|1.0|The book started out with the main character John telling us that he wants to write a book about the creation of the atom bomb.  But, the book is nothing about the atom bomb, in fact the atom bomb is rarely mentioned.  The book then went on to tell us about how he went to the lab where the bomb was created, and talked to the late Dr. Felix Hoenikker's family and friends.  Then John started telling us about this weird made up religion called Bokonon.  This is where the book starts to become horrible... Crazy things start happening and none of them make any sense at all.      The reason I chose to read this book was that I had read Slaughter House 5, and loved it.  But this book wasn't written anything like SL5.  I absolutely hated this book because of the fact there was abosolutely no point to it.  Every book I've read has had a theme to it, but not this one.  No important stories were told, no messages were expressed, and no action occurred.  The book was extremely dark and hadn't even the slightest bit of happiness in it.  I would recommend this book to know one because it's an absolute waste of time to read.
B00005ASQ1|4.0|Finding Forrester was a moving tale of friendship. It is a touching story of overcoming obstacles to achieve greatness.  I enjoyed the film, though I thought it was a bit slow moving.  However, it features a surprise cameo near the end by MATT DAMON, and completely redeems itself.
B00005B36H|5.0|The press machine which has been whirling around Tool often comments on the way that the act focuses on the development of their own concepts and musical vision with little regard for the commercial musical scene. By the end of the first listen, it is apparent that the press has not exaggerated this claim, for the music on Lateralus contains a great deal of growth and development extending directly from their past work.<br />In contrast with previous albums, Lateralus often maintains a much more composed demeanor; there are fewer moments of overt fury exposed on the album. Tool has branched out into increasingly layered and subtle textures (a la King Crimson or Dream Theater), resulting in some wonderful moments in songs such as &quot;Disposition&quot; or &quot;Parabola&quot;. A number of the songs also explore a very trance-like texture (&quot;Reflection&quot; and &quot;Parabol&quot;). Maynard's voice is in fine form, and it is clear that his stint in A Perfect Circle has expanded his horizons. Lyrically, the subject material is less combative and more contemplative than that of Undertow or Aenima.<br />Devotees of Tool's past work should not be dismayed, however. Danny Carey's percussion is outstanding, and the intensity of Tool's signature jarring riffs is often in no short supply. Fans of such songs as &quot;Aenema&quot; or &quot;Stinkfist&quot; will no doubt feel satisfied with &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; or &quot;The Grudge&quot;.<br />Although 5 years without any new material made this listener somewhat skeptical of the potential for Lateralus, Tool has not only delivered a disc which satisfies, but which has great potential for discovery over the next 5 years.
B00005B36H|3.0|I just got the cd today and listened to the whole thing through.  This CD isnt as good as Tool's other CDs.  There arent any pure, clean, heavy tool songs on the album.  Every once in a while you hear something that sounds like the classic Tool sound but most of it is slow drums and synthesized noises.  I cant believe they spent so long in the studio with this almbum and did not live up to our expectations.
B00004RHZU|5.0|Pink is what the hip/hop world needs. She's white and has pink hair which people find a big shock about. She also does her thing and does it good. Who cares what others say? \\"Do what U do\\" she says over and over and over, and you can tell mami takes her own advice. She is very strong and doesn't take (anything) from anybody which is why I like this chick. She also got a sensitive and loving side, you can barely see it but it comes out on \\"Stop fallin\\" and \\"Love is Such a Crazy Thing.\\" She sounds a lot like Faith Evans on that song it's scary. Her song with Mya and Christina is cool too. Pink is just what I've been looking for music. Keep on, girl.
B0000025YM|5.0|I absolutely love Judas Priest. Defenders of the Faith has had some negative reviews and i thought it might be just an average album by them, but i was wrong. This is as good as any Priest and one of the best albums of all time. the music on this album sums up why i like heavy metal, great aggressive guitar playing, great singing and great songwriting.  The song Rock hard, Ride Free is just superb , the intro is one of the most emotional guitar riffs ive ever heard. the others are superb as well. if u like real heavy metal buy this and enjoy heavy metal how its meant to sound.
B000059ZLH|5.0|For those of us who appreciate the over the top talent and virtuosity of this band, this video is a perfect example of why Dream Theater fans are such fanatics....<br />What is particularly special here is the great care that was taken to make this DVD release so special. First of all, the performance is awesome! Which is very cool considering the fact that it is all from the same night -- AND that the band performed for something like four hours that night.<br />Second, the camera footage is possibly the best I have ever seen in a concert video. The multiple camera angle shots are perfect for Dream Theater when they get into the incredibly intricate instrumental passages that are contained in most of their (EPIC) songs. It's rare that you can't see something you want to in this video. I believe that drummer Mike Portnoy's involvement in this project is what made this possible.<br />Third, most of this amazing concert is included. In addition to the 1 1/2 hours or so of the &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot; performance, another hour of other footage is included (DT classics &quot;A Change of Seasons,&quot; &quot;Learning to Live,&quot; and &quot;A Mind Beside Itself,&quot; each in their entirety).<br />This release clearly makes up for some of the disappointment of their &quot;Five Years in a Livetime&quot; video. The virtuosity is much more on display in this one and the camera work is so much better... I won't even go there.<br />The one fault is that the volume is a bit low during the &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot; portion. It SOUNDS to me - and I could be wrong - that it has either been compressed or downsampled, because with DVD just turning it up should solve the problem. Yet somehow the midrange sounds a little thin to me, not quite full enough (a little less punch than it should have). A minor gripe though.

B00005B36H|5.0|...you'll love their latest effort.  From start to finish, this picks up where Aenima left off sonically, while Maynard's vocals and songwriting shine possibly even brighter than they ever have (his vocals definitely do).  Adam, Danny, and Justin are in top form.  Listening to Lateralus is one of those rare experiences that lives up to your expectations.<br />There's not a bad track to be found on this disc (the last track is a bit superfluous), but my personal favorites are The Grudge and Lateralus.  In those two tracks the msuic is extraordinarily well constructed and put together, and Maynard's voice is at its fiercest, beautifully raw best.  Like Tool's previous work, however, viable arguments could be made for just about any other song as well.<br />Buy it, live it, love it.  It really is that simple.
B00005B36H|5.0|Come on, this is Tool we're talking about, only the most amazing band in the industry today.  This album continues on the path they set with Aenmia, heading in an even more artistic direction.  That is not a bad think, mind you.  Nowhere does Tool get too artistic to the point of, say, Radiohead.  It's still Tool, and it's still great music.  Bass lines seem to be the backbone of this album.  Justin Chancellor is a great bassist, and these bass lines prove it.  Just listen to &quot;Schism&quot; for proof.  This is easily better than anything off of Opiate or Undertow, and it is right up there with Aenima in terms of how good they are.  I have also noticed the reduction of the &quot;BS tracks&quot; (i.e. - Mantra, Eon Blue Apocalypse), but the short tracks here are way cool.  &quot;Faaip De Oiad&quot; (translated to &quot;Voice Of God&quot;) is a guy talking about Area 51 with lots of static, &quot;Mantra&quot; is VERY creepy, with ghost-sounding noises, and &quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse&quot; is some cool guitars.  Now on to the songs.  The first single, &quot;Schism&quot;, is the worst song here.  Everything else blows it away.  The best are &quot;Ticks And Leeches&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot;.  &quot;Ticks And Leeches&quot; is very heavy with alot of screaming from the always-amazing Maynard James Keenan.  &quot;Parabola&quot; sounds like it has some A Perfect Circle influence, but the lyrics are mind-blowing.  I must say the drumming by Danny Carey is unparalleled on this album.  A man with two arms and two legs should not be able to do what he does.  It's in-human.  Listen to the beginning of &quot;Ticks And Leeches&quot; or the end of &quot;Schism&quot; for proof.  &quot;Parabol&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot; are actually one song cut up in two songs, but &quot;Parabola&quot; is way better.  Well, after five years' wait, this might not be worth it to some, but it's a great CD.  &quot;Lateralus&quot; is the best CD of 2000, and it probably won't be matched for a while.  Go buy it.  Now.
B000002MFE|5.0|Eric Clapton sat down one night with a couple of musicians and background singers and took the stage to give one of the best unplugged concerts there ever was on MTV.  The Acoustic version of Layla was phenominal and the soulful Tears in Heaven was so beautiful despite the tragedy from which it was inspired.  The best song of the whole concert without a doubt was Old Love.  A seven and a half minute diddy that had a great Guitar and Piano solo.  Buy this now.
B00005B36H|5.0|What an amazing album. With all this stuff playing on the radio today, I feel like rock is just about dead. What ever happened to cool bands like Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumkins? Well, it looks like Tool is here to save the day. This is one of the most amazing albums I have ever heard. YOU WILL BE BLOWN AWAY. I'm speachless....
B00005B36H|5.0|As I have said in the past, being a TOOL fan has its ups and down.  No this is not a typo.  The &quot;down&quot; I refer is the long wait between releases.  A Perfect Circle seemed to pacify fans for a short while, as did Salival, but they weren't enough.  Lateralus is in my opinion, the greatest TOOL album to date.  From the opening of The Grudge's hard guitar and vocals even, to the strange Art Bell phone-in at the end of the album, Lateralus is surely a masterpiece.  I was a little disappointed when I heard that there would be fewer segues than nima, their last album, because they seemed to mesh the album together.  But on Lateralus, one cannot really tell whether a song is a &quot;song&quot; or a &quot;segue&quot;.  Each song is attached to the next song, whether there is a change of pace, or continuation, as in Parabol to Parabola.  Trust me, even if you are not a TOOL fan religiously, buy this album.  It will be in the annals of The Beatle's &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, or Pink Floyd's &quot;Darkside of the Moon&quot;.  I still haven't found the word I want to use to describe it.  Maybe &quot;breathtaking&quot;, or simply &quot;amazing&quot;.
B00005B36H|4.0|I hadn't become a TOOL fan until Eulogy was the new single.  After that I had bought Aenima and Undertoe in the same day.  Both of those albums are amazing, and when I read about the fourth coming album about a year and half ago I was over-whelmed with anticipation.  But since then, there had been delay after delay after delay, a side project and a DVD/Live Disc.  All of this just to keep TOOL fans hooked.  I was lucky enough to get a copy of LATERALUS the night before it's release.  After one listen I thought that it was amazing, but lacking something.  It still has the bone crunching guitars in PARABOLA and TICKS AND LEACHES, which is nice.  However, It seems that the melow nature of A PERFECT CIRCLE had some influence on the disc.  I admit it was not worth the five years in waiting, but it was, without a doubt worth every cent I paid for it.  I believe this album will not only appeal to TOOL fans, but maybe even bring in some new fans.
B000002LGQ|4.0|For awhile now I was mostly a fan of Madonna's current work with \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"Music\\" but lately I have been influenced to delve deeper into her large catalog. \\"Like A Prayer\\" is the last album she would do straight-forward pop before moving on to incorporating different genres of music with pop music like the r&b-influenced sound on \\"Bedtime Stories\\".<br />After listening to the original versions of \\"Like A Prayer\\" and \\"Express Yourself\\" (as opposed to the IC's versions), I can't say I prefer one version over the other. Both songs are great, remixed or not. I didn't particularly care for \\"Love Song\\", otherwise I would have given this cd a 5-star review. I don't think that was one of Madonna's better songs overall. \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\" is excellent, one of my favorite non-single tracks off this overall excellent album. Asides from \\"Love Song\\", I love \\"Like A Prayer\\". It is definitely one of Madonna's better albums pre-\\"Ray of Light\\".
B00005B36H|5.0|Hey man... its a good CD. Schism is perfect and the others too. Buy this one.. <br />Bye Bye<br />BRAZIL
B00005B36H|5.0|It's been five long years since Tool's released anything.  However, Lateralus is more than worth the wait.  Lateralus is the quintessential tool album.  Maynard James Keenan, the most versatile vocalist in music, has outdone himself on this album.  That is not to say, however, that anything else has been sacraficed.  This album is the ominous, free-floating magic that you've come to expect from Tool, spiked with the vision that only a five year hiatus can provide.  That said, Lateralus also has the most amazing art (cover, sleeve, etc.) that I've ever seen.  It is a true pleasure to behold.  In fact, even if you don't like Tool, buy this and throw the CD out.  Keep the cover.  <br />In short, Lateralus is the most amazing CD I own. Buy it, buy it, buy it!  Shut up and buy it!  Send more money!  Shut up and buy it!
B00005B36H|5.0|The first thing you'll notice is the packaging on this CD. The work is by Alex Gray, a visionary artist. But the packaging! The CD booklet is like the sectional portion of the human body section of an encyclopedia. Tool put some money into this. The music is the best thing I've heard in a long time with the exception of Autechre's new CD Confield. Each song is a work of art. The two I didn't like as much as the other stuff on this CD (The Patient and Disposition)--which is chocked full at about 79 minutes--grew on me with repeated listenings. Now I love them both. Its too bad more people won't buy this. I know I keep calling everything about this a work of art, but trust me, if you like Tool at all you should agree. Its nice to see a band that actually cares enough about its fans to put some time and money into a project other than just squeezing out another barely produced work of a record company panel.
B00005ASQ1|4.0|This movie, Finding Forrester, is one which at first sparked little interest in my viewing it.  But, after viewing it, I was pleasantly surprised as well as pleased.  This movie provides drama as well as love.  Subtle comedy occasionally appears throughout the movie especially when Forrester(Connery) makes Jamal write a 5000 word essay about &quot;why he should stay the &amp;#*@ our of his home&quot;. Jamal obliges.  The movie's ironic and unusual friendship between Forrester and Jamal add color and mystery to this movie.  The next time that you are in Blockbuster on a weekend, you should consider renting Finding Forrester.  I promise you won't be disappointed.
B00005B36H|5.0|I waited for over an hour in biting wind and rain to get this album on the release date.  The record store was amazed at the line of Tool fans jutting out from the mall.  They opened the doors at 12, and unleashed a horde of gnawing, gnashing, bumping, and pushing Tool-addicts to the pile of Tool cds stacked neatly (for a few seconds).  I slammed down the money for the disc and scrambled back to my car, grudging the fools that make it so hard to open the packaging.  I popped in the cd.  I cranked it up.  It was bliss.<br />If you're not a Tool fan, you may not understand.  For those who are Tool fans, there is no need for conversion.  They either have this cd or are waiting impatiently to get it.  It is the disbelievers who are still waiting for the gospel of Tool that I am writing this.<br />Fanaticism aside, this cd rocks on a purely artistic basis.  It's composure reminded me much more of Undertow than Aenima, though the cd features a sound of a fully mature Tool.  This song features awesome guitar all around, with beautiful, brooding songs like &quot;Parabol(a)&quot; and &quot;Lateralus&quot;, along with heavy, knocking-your-socks-off pieces of work like &quot;The Grudge&quot; and &quot;Ticks &amp; Leeches&quot;.  I've only listened to this cd twice through so far, but every song is one that sates the neurons and makes the kind of music many bands would sell their soul for.  <br />This cd has earned itself a place in my car stereo for some time to come.  If you're a Tool fan, you already know what the fervor's about.  If not, well - this is a good place to start.
0385486804|5.0|I had to write in opposition to those who only know grammer, sentence structure and collect bound text.  To dismiss the story on the basis of word-smithing value or academic relevance is to typify the rampant lack of &quot;greatness&quot; that pervades us as a people today.  Yes, Chris should have gone better prepared and blah-blah-blah but rather I say that I empathize with his search for an answer to this life rift with posturing, jostling, acting for position/address/exclusiveness.  He sought to find a place where love for one another as humans exist with peace as the lever to truth and real bonding to one another and all things that reside in the natural world. Write to me if you understand and as was Chris are a dreamer/idealist/lover of life.
B00005B36H|5.0|Seriously, this album makes the 5+ year wait since Aenima disappear.  TOOL take you on a sonic journey through 79 minutes of incredible music.  Don't just listen...visualize.  Let the music paint pictures in your mind and you will begin to understand TOOL.  And if you thought the holographic cover from the Aenima CD jewel case was cool, wait until you see this.  OUTSTANDING!
6305499365|5.0|If you've ever worked in a tiny cubicle, pushed papers, and fought a worthless fax machine in an attempt to earn a living, you will love this movie. OFFICE SPACE is a hilarious movie that deconstructs everything that makes an office worker's life so miserable: from morning traffic, to catch phrases (it looks like somone has the Moondays), to bosses that totally ignore their workers. This movie had a low budget, but Mike Judge is a brilliant filmmaker. He takes a relatively unknown cast and is able to milk hilarious, yet totally lifelike performances from each actor and unites everything together in a coherent conceptually comedy masterpiece (e.g. the fax-beating scene with the ganster music playing is just pure brilliance). Of course, the film says a lot about the actors as well, they don't seem to be just characters or caricatures: they seem like real people.  There is no sex, relative little violence (well, there is a lot of violence toward inanimate objects), and relatively little cursing words (most of the foul language comes from the film's soundtrack). A movie that's destined to become a modern comedy classic.
B000002G26|3.0|The next question is how? <br /> I have this on tape and at the age of 12, this music acutally seemed cool.  But I pulled it out the other day and wished that in 1994, I was listening to Soundgarden and not Bryan Adams.  Why? <br /> Everything that Adams's does is for the fans, you can tell that in the CD.  Summer of '69 starts the CD and the first couple times you hear it, you might be mistaken into thinking it's a great rock song.  Then you realize, first, it's a pop song with a fairly simple riff that's more pop than punk, and second the lyrics are terrible and they jump.  &quot;Ain't no use in complaining when you got a job to do, spent my nights down at the drive-in and that's when I met you.&quot;  Right.  Oh, they say the song is autobiographical, what 10-year old has a band where &quot;Jimmy gets married&quot;.  <br /> Anyway, it gets worse after that.  &quot;Everything I do&quot; has gotten mind-bogglingly annoying after five years away from it, no wonder I missed Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves.   <br /> Adams's seems to copy a slightly old-hat style that just doesn't hold up musically anymore.  Eddie Money comes to mind a lot in listening to ol' Bryan croon in songs like &quot;It's only Love&quot; and &quot;Run To You&quot;. <br /> Listen to &quot;Do I have to say the words?&quot; and it almost seems like producer Mutt Lange forgot to give the song to the boys of Def Leppard for their next power ballad.  <br /> Just like the acts Adams had the misfortune of copying, it seems as if he has hit the Where Are They Now part of his career.  Still, the music, mindless and trite as it may be, is enjoyable in groups to sing along to and reminisce about the old times.  Just don't think to hard about how this Canadian could have been the most precious import to the US in the 80s.
0140186409|5.0|What a great novel...i wasn't much of a reader in high school, but now that i have a child, i thought it best to see what i missed.  Boy, did I miss!  If you have to pick one &quot;classic&quot; novel to read, this is a don't miss.  Now I see why classics are called classics.
B00005B36H|1.0|I should have listened to my instincts and I would be $15 richer.  I heard the 1st single on the radio and hated it.  I figured the rest of the songs would be better but they weren't.
0812589041|4.0|I've never been a big science fiction fan.  I've found that most of the genre's authors substitute believable characters and good dialogue with &quot;over the top&quot; situations and techno-babble.  Thus, I was a little apprehensive when I started Ender's Game.  Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.  <br />Card avoids the trap that catches a good number of science fiction writers by not focusing the story on the aliens or even on the technology.  In fact, those elements are very much in the book's background.  Instead, he focuses the story on the character of Ender Wiggin.  Centering the story on this point not only allows Card to dispense with the baggage that bogs down most science fiction, but also allows him to develop a fully realized character who conveys genuine emotions.  By completely developing Ender's personality, Card makes a science fiction story that seems much more realistic and plausible than its setting would indicate.<br />I wouldn't put this book in the &quot;masterpiece&quot; category, mainly because I thought the ending was a little too rushed.  However, it is one of the best science fiction books I've ever read.  It would make an excellent introduction to the genre for children or anyone who previously hasn't read science fiction.
B000001FS3|5.0|My experience with this CD is rather interesting.  My brother had heard about this CD from a friend, so he bought it.  The first time he played it (about a year ago), I realized that this is one of the best CD's I have heard, and it still holds to that position.  In fact, I still haven't heard all of the songs, but the one's that I have heard (quite a few of them) are fantastic!  This music draws you in rapidly, and before you know it, you &quot;give yourself away&quot; to its musically-gifted singers.    This &quot;desert rose&quot; allows one to escape the cares of the world and enter into a state of peaceful thoughtfulness.  As the music passes by, the listener begins to drift away in the sea of pacific harmony.  This group's musical talent is phenomenal. As can be determined from the earlier imagery, U2 does many of the same types of techniques.  By using imagery, both musical and lyrical, this group creates an actual place &quot;where streets have no name.&quot;  I recommend that everybody should listen to this CD.  Whether you get the CD or not is up to you, but the music should absolutely not pass by without taking the time to listen to it.
B00005B36H|5.0|Simply put this album was well worth the wait. I bought a copy the day it came out and havent stopped listening to it since. The opening track &quot;the grudge&quot; sets the pace with a slightly new percussion led assult that some tool fans may not be used to, however, it is not with out tools signature mesmerising bass line and distant vocals. Tracks such as &quot;eon blue apocalypse&quot; may seem quite out of place but soon take there place. The high-lights of this album are undoubtably tracks such as the haunting &quot;schisim&quot; but you will find that you will more then likely pick out your own, as it is clearly not a one single album. Also worth pointing out are a few tracks that may pass as instrumentals such as the powerful &quot;triad&quot;, which i believe is a first for tool, and clearly something they do quit well. There are many other differents worth pointing out however i do not wish to ruin the excitment for you. SO i will close by simply saying should you choose to buy this album, you will not regret it.
B00005B36H|4.0|After 4 years the new album just can't be a bad album. But it ain't as good as &quot;aenima&quot;. As a whole aenima is much better than lateralus. There is amazing songs in lateralus, like: The grudge, The patient, schism and the best song on the album; Lateralis!! That song makes the album have 4 stars! But nothing like : stinkfist, eulogy or Aenema.    There is the sister song in lateralus which includes ; Disposition, reflection and triad. And that is the most disapointing in this album. There is just too little singing and too much arty things!! But reflection is a pretty good song still!! Lateralus is a great album, eventhought it techinally contains only 7 songs. And only 6 good one's because &quot;ticks and leeches&quot; is a awfull song....but if you want to listen the best music in the world...you buy this cd!!! Tool rulez!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Beautiful flowing vocal melodies and fierce drumming.  Rythmatic bass and soaring guitars.  All of these come together (once again) on Lateralus.  The members of Tool are masters of their art:  From Maynard's poetical lyrics to Danny's unsurpassed drumming abilities.  This album allows the listener to be swept away from their everyday lives and into a world of incredible music.  <br />This is an era of music aimed at the simple minds of the world.  These are people that don't want to be challenged when they listen to music.  This album came out at exactly the right time too.  I was getting so tired of bad music, it seems like that's all that is out there these days.  Rarely music comes out that forces the audience to evaluate their beliefs and take a look at themselves.  But Tool does this in their unique style.  And they do it amazingly.  <br />My favorite tracks on this album (so far) are: &quot;Parabola,&quot;  the vocals on this track are simply amazing.  The guitar riffs are great too.  I absolutly love the bass riff on &quot;Schism.&quot;  That entire track is superb.  I also have to plug the album's artwork.  My jaw literally dropped when I opened and examined the CD.  Adam Jones did a mindblowing job on it.<br />But enough of me rambling.  Its time for everyone to experience music at its best.  Buy this album.  It is truly top-notch.  Good work guys.
B00005B36H|5.0|There are very few things in this life that I hold to be absolutely true, and one such truth is the fact that this band is a great band.  Tool has pushed the limits of music time and time again with their incredible musicianship, unique songwriting, and fearless vision making the impossible possible with such ease and artistry that my heart aches with every listen.  Their previous records are flawlessly performed with more conviction and passion than I've ever heard and &quot;Lateralus&quot; is further proof that Tool is indeed a great great band.   &quot;The Grudge&quot; begins this record like the second-coming of something horribly beautiful, powerful, and devastating as the record moves through its 70 plus minutes teasing the listener with an intense subtely that dares you to stop the album before it's finished its last revolution in your stereo.  Tool is a legend in the making and this record further validates their place among the giants of music who have pushed, questioned, and innovated all the rules, for the aim of every true artist is not to conform to history but to replace it with their own...and &quot;Lateralus&quot; is the lastest chapter.
B000050XEI|5.0|Some people said the album had no surprise. Well, true. But it didn't need any surprise to show its beauty. The album has a very Enya feel to it. And each song was very carefully produced. I especially like &quot;wild child&quot;, &quot;only time&quot; and &quot;lazy days&quot; (and &quot;first of autumn&quot;, which unfortunately is available only in the European edition).<br />Some people urge Enya to experiment. But that might not be a good idea. each artist has his/her strong suit. And definitely Enya has hers and it's clear what that strong suit of hers is. Why change while she can still make use of her own advantage so well and so many still love that?<br />The only possible disappointment one has about the album is: there's no surprise. But nobody can deny that with this new album, Enya has reached a new height in the beloved Enya-styled music.
B00005B36H|5.0|In the current world of bad music there is tool, whose latest release has thrown down a new challenge to everyone in the music industry.  With the current crop of boy bands, knockout blondes, remakes, and various duets, the music industry has become a slave to the people, at least Milli Vanilli came clean with the fact that they didn't do anything for themselves.  Then there is tool, who has been dormant since '96 before any of the afore mentioned music came into the mainstream, they have produced &quot;Lateralus&quot;.  An album that cannot be compared to anything.  It is not A Perfect Circle, but yet an entirely different being altogether, one that kicks off with a &quot;Grudge&quot; and continues to what could be the best album ending since &quot;Undertow&quot; (To which there is no comparison).  The music industry has become tainted and spoiled, with the &quot;Napster&quot; court rulings and the disgrace that was &quot;Woodstock&quot;.  It is time for an album that brings unity back to the system, and shows all the little people how it's done.  Until the next tool album...
B00004YLIU|5.0|Radiohead never bores you.  This album is an expansion of the ever-evolving sound of the most innovative band out there.  I wouldn't reccommend it to Backstreet Boys and Britney fans.  Must listen with an open ear.
B00004U9WR|5.0|(note) for word limitations, this review is a two part one)<br />TOY STORY was a terrific experience in the theaters when I saw it in December of 1995. Although the story was the buddy action drama that's been done countless times, the film made it work all over again. The feeling Woody has that Buzz has taken everything that he cared about (He is no longer Andy's favorite toy, the other toys seem to look at him as an old hat once they meet Buzz) makes it understandable that he would try to get rid of this space toy. And Buzz is an endearing character because he has no idea he's just a toy. It's an interesting thing at how the story sets it up so that Woody accepts that he isn't Andy's favorite toy at the same time Woody accepts that a toy is what he really is. This is proven in Sid's bedroom during the rainy night where they both wait for the next day when Buzz would get blown to pieces. <br />While this is going on, the action and animation is just astonishing. The detail that the Pixar team put into every frame had my eyes bulging out of their sockets. I didn't think that would occur when I saw it again, but watching TOY STORY on a friend's DVD ROM computer, it did. Not only that, but I saw little touches in the background that I didn't realize before, such as the titles of the books in Andy's room. (I won't spoil the titles here, only say that they're a Pixar in-joke)<br />The Dolby Digital 5.1 effect on TOY STORY is excellent. The bass effect is well demonstrated in scenes such as when a truck nearly runs over Woody. If you have a top quality 5.1 channel surround sound theater, I highly recommend that you purchase this box set while you still can. Both movies are THX certified with THX Optimode (for adjusting picture and sound quality), but they also contain an exclusive bonus. For TOY STORY, Pixar created a THX trailer starring a little robot named &quot;Tex&quot; that demonstrates the 5.1 surround effect.<br />Pixar also included its Academy Award winning short &quot;TIN TOY&quot; (1988) on the TOY STORY disc as well as a commentary by John Lasseter and several members of Pixar.
B00005B1EX|4.0|Rob Halford is the consumate performer. I'd like another live album to go with this one, I'd like to hear everything the guy has ever done on CD in live versions.  Live Insurection Delivers classic Rob Halford at his elderly mightyest.  He has gotten older but he is still way better than most of the younger bands that are on the radio today.  Check out SLOW DOWN, Prisoner of Your Eyes, Life in Black, Silent Screams, and The One You Love to Hate, and turn that motha up!<br />Can't wait for more from Rob and the New Judas Priest!  Buy it all, These guys have been making great music for 30 years!
B00005B36H|5.0|I have been listening to Tool since Opiate I have to say that to me this has got to be the best Tool album; please here me out  the grudge sucks you in with its melodic guitar which immediatly sucks you in with curiosity waiting for that one song that will leave cold like stinkfist but its not there instead what is there is the bands excellent musicianship which is explored like a labrynthe of musical corridors which will beg you to get lost.  Very different from any Tool album from past but if you have any shred of knowledge on decent music you will buy this album!
B00005B36H|5.0|This is probably one of the most highly awaited albums in a while and happily I can say it does not disappoint.  After 5 1/2 years Tool have continued to amaze.  From the first track you hear how they have developed.  Maynard's vocals are more superb than last time, his time with A Perfect Circle has really helped I think, he is more personally emotional, more melodic, just fantastic. Adam has developed the art of subtilty perfectly, his guitar work intricate and emotional.  Justin has obviously been practicing!  Not that any of his work in the past has been bad but tracks like Schism and Lateralis show how good of a bassist he is.  And Danny shows he is one of the best drummers out there right now, especially his work on Ticks &amp; Leeches as well as Triad.  As a group they have developed each track like a symphony with differing movements, emotions and actions.  In light of the current music scene an album like this is a breath of fresh air.  This is not for anyone with a short attention span, clocking in at just under 79 min. it is a monolith of an album.  Track by track the album is superb but as a single entity the album is magical.  With influences such as King Crimson and early Yes present it is fantastic that a band can still make music that is innovative, emotionally filling as well as utterly fantastic and not at all pretentious.  This album is a must for anyone who loves music.
B000002LOE|1.0|Never has a band taken so long to achieve superstardom, never has a band become irrelevant so quickly.  This was their eagerly awaited breakthrough album but it came at too high a price.  Desperate, it seems, to do the unexpected for their first Warner Bros release the group diluted the distinctive sound of Life's Rich Pageant, Document and Green, anxious not to be seen to cash in on a winning formula.  The result is an album whose first side is unlistenable, its second requiring use of the programme button to select `Half a World Away' (just), `Country Feedback' and `Me in Honey'.  Oh, and for a band whose covers were always pretty ropey (think Fables of the Reconstruction), Out of Time plumbs new depths of banality.
B00004X01U|5.0|I think that this is one of Madonna's best works yet. Now that she is older and more mature, her music tallents are really starting to show. I would recamend this to all age groups. It has a little of eveything in it.I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.
0790737345|4.0|Meg Ryan (as Maggie Rice, a heart surgeon) and Nicolas Cage (as an angel only known as Seth--well, Seth &quot;Plate&quot;, actually;-) star in this serious, but warm-hearted fantasy, and both do their usual fine job.  But it was Dennis Franz (as an angel that has already \\"fallen\\") that added some real heart that this movie, on occasion, strangely lacked.  What a fine actor he is!<br />A remake of &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (which I haven't as yet seen), this film has some wonderful moments.  As the title suggests, the story concerns angels, and the part they play when interacting with the dying.  This story becomes more interesting when Seth becomes attracted to Maggie after complications arise from a bypass surgery that she performed on a patient.  Soon after, Seth becomes obsessed with Maggie and in a wonderful scene, becomes visible to her as she walks the halls of the hospital after visiting hours.  Their interactions with each other throughout the film were touching. <br />When I think of angels, I think of beautiful people in white flowing robes, halos, light, and often wings.  &quot;City of Angels&quot; keeps the beautiful people concept, but to their credit, dresses them in ankle-length, dark gray leather coats.  Also, these angels don't really interfere with life, or fate.  Their sole purpose is to comfort.  This also created a rich, but subdued feel to the film.<br />The basic plot question is, will Seth take the &quot;fall&quot; and become human so he can have a life with the woman he loves?  It's not a cut and dried answer, as Seth finds tremendous beauty and comfort being an Angel of God.  And again, to the films credit ... well, you'll just have to purchase or rent the film to find out.<br />I had wished, however, that the footage that ended up on the cutting room floor could have been added to this film (fortunately the CD contains these deleted scenes on side B, along with some interesting commentary).  I would have also loved to have seen scenes where Maggie begins having a true revelation about Seth.  This important part was played down in the film, and ultimately hurt it, making it less satisfying for this viewer.  And because key scenes were deleted, which would have filled in things so very, very nicely, the final product came off as rather odd, or even a bit cold, at times.<br />I do however, highly recommend this film.  Along with what I've already pointed out, there are some nice special effects, some seductive scenery, along with a memorable soundtrack (especially McLachlan's \\"Angel\\", which played in the background of a rather poignant scene).  In many ways, I feel that parts of this film could be considered works of art.  Between 1 and 10, I give &quot;City of Angels&quot; a solid 8.  It's a very good film, a touching film, but a film that missed being a &quot;don't miss gem&quot; because of some surprising (to me, at least) editing decisions.  If we're lucky, maybe one day we will get to see the &quot;Director's Cut&quot;.
B00005B36H|5.0|How long has it been now, 5 years. I remember back in 1996 when the music scene was still looking up. Even after recovering from the death of grunge, music was still tolerable. Now in 2001 the radio is filled with nonsensical boy bands and pop stars who's image tarnishes what little musical talent they have. So what was Tools response? A perfect album. And no one has made a perfect album in years. Enjoy it while hoping some new artists are taking notes. Perfect Album says it all
B00005B36H|4.0|This review is after a single listening, from beginning to end.  I've followed the group since the early 90's and have enjoyed their growth and maturity as a group.  &quot;Lateralus&quot; doesn't let you down.  Without going into all of the songs, it shows and feels like the next logical step for Tool.  The long wait was worth it, get this cd!
6304057709|4.0|If you like period films, wonderful heroes (some dashing, but flawed - others not so dashing, but true!) and intelligent heroines.  You will enjoy this film.<br />Ms. Thompson's adaption is great.  A few bad &quot;guys&quot;, wonderful good &quot;guys&quot; and a happy and tidy ending.  The acting is first rate - from the main characters to supporting.  If you purchase this film, you will not be dissappointed!
0062513346|2.0|In this story, which is purported to be \\"true\\", the author and his wife journey to the California dessert so that he can see his guardian angel.  Toward this end they journey from town to town with a horde of biker chicks, perform various meditations and pagan rituals, and generally work through their own issues.<br /><br />The story itself is interesting, but as a Christian I found the religious content disturbing.  The author seems wrapped up in an occult-like and mystical form of Christianity that ironically seems to have left Christ out of the equation.  Whereas Jesus advocated the banishment of the ego to bring our spirits into agreement with God's will, the type of Christianity we see here is all about self - pagan rituals, creating a feeling, and traveling to another continent to \\"see\\" an angel.  I'm pretty liberal in my Christian theology, but at it's core Christ's message was one of loving God and loving each other.  The Bible tells us that the signs of a Christ-based life are \\"Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control\\".  But despite the fact that these characters are supposedly highly \\"spiritual\\", their lives, at least as they appear in this story, are instead characterized by anxiety, detachment, and underlying hostility amongst themselves.<br /><br />Furthermore, the author at one point deigns to cast aspersions about the spiritual slumber that the average person is in.  I'm the first to admit that modern-day Christianity needs a good kick in the arse, - but (to use one of the lead characters, Valhalla as an example) I don't think leaving our spouses and children, becoming prostitutes, joining a biker gang, and performing odd pagan rituals is an improvement over the status quo.<br /><br />At the end of the book, the author tacks on a 2 or 3 page dissertation about Jesus and Love that seems strangely incongruent with the story that was just told.<br /><br />If you haven't read The Alchemist, read that instead of this book.  If you have already read The Alchemist read it again instead of this book.book.  If you have already read The Alchemist read it again instead of this book.<BR><BR>
6303965415|4.0|Jane Austen is perhaps one of the most enduring writers.  Her heroines are usually intelligent and practical.  Actress Amanda Root is perfect as &quot;Anne&quot;.  Her family is ridiculous and many of the characters just as interesting (even the good, but misguided ones).  'Anne' many not be the most beautiful (or that young, as per practice of that period), but she is someone worthy of devotion as we see in the once spurned love, Captain Wentworth.<br />If you are looking for fast paced action, stylized sex, high tech effects - this is not the film for you.  However, if you love a well developed story, wonderful characters. wonderful film production and a sweet story (with a happy ending!), you will greatly enjoy Persuasion.
B00005B36H|5.0|I feared how good this album would be, as in the case of NIN's The Fragile.  But Tool brings us some really great music on the new album.  Reflection would have to be my favorite track on it.  The CD has a perfect balance of hard and mellow music, all I can say is, it's nice.  Nice, Nice, Not too bad, I can dig it.
6302719631|4.0|Jane Austen was an amazing and very witty writer.  However, her books were written for a different time period. I did read the book, Northanger Abbey, and although still delightful, it was rather slow. I felt the movie did an excellent job of condensing many scenes from the book into one or two scenes (mostly having to do with action ocurring at a ball)in the movie.<br />If you love Jane Austen, period films, delicate love stories or glimpses of society in a very different time - I would recommend this movie.  It is treat.
B00005B36H|5.0|Well at long last we have finally been given the opportunity to hear the newest collection of songs from one of the most important rock bands of the last 20-30 years.<br />Tool are a band that don't conform and they don't need to because they have built up a huge following of avid believers who will always be there when Tool do anything remotely interesting.<br />Aenima was the last album is perhaps the album that took Tool on to a new plateau, the music was deep and emotional and ebb and flowed and twisted and contorted with each passing minute. Quite simply the album was a masterpiece which many have copied but none have bettered.<br />Lateralus is the latest release and anyones first thought is going to be whether it is better than Aenima. Well that can never be decided because Tools music is all about having your own opinion and not being afraid to speak your mind, so my suggestion is to buy the album and then decide for yourself.<br />The album itself starts with &quot;The Grudge&quot; which is an 8 minute epic which twists and turns and has quiet and loud moments. Indeed, there are no tracks under 5 minutes long with the exception of the instrumental tracks such as &quot;Mantra&quot;.<br />Each song is beautifully crafted and you can forgive the band for the 5 yr wait in an instant. &quot;Parabol&quot; is a very quiet, atmospheric piece with Maynards haunting vocals layered over Adam Jones aching guitar, this is the prelude to the track &quot;Parabola&quot; which explodes into life and will literally make you wet yourself with excitement....Tool are back!!<br />The musicanship between all four members has never been stronger and the notable highlight is Danny Careys drumming which is at a consistent high throughout.<br />&quot;Schism&quot;, the 1st single from the album is classic Tool and will leave no one dissapointed, likewise &quot;The Patient&quot;.<br />The undoubted highlights for me are &quot;Reflection&quot; which is a 11 minute track which slowly builds and builds leaving you in awe at its finale and &quot;Lateralis&quot; which for me is the best track on the album. It starts in a quiet manner with a typical Adam Jones riff and you can hear the drumming gently fade in before it explodes into life with a typically complicated yet beautiful riff, the song is over 9 mins but you hardly notice it and Maynard sounds as angry and thought provoking as ever....simply brilliant.<br />In summary, Tool have once again re-written the blueprint for modern day rock music. Many bands will undoubtedly try to copy again and the public may well continue to support the likes of Linkin Park and Papa Roach (which is ok by me as I like them too) but Tool are THE band around and will continue to be long after they call it a day.<br />Lateralus is everything I could have hoped for and more and I urge anyone who believes in serious, intelligent rock music to buy this album and spend the next few years trying to pull all the pieces together.
B00005ASQ1|5.0|I rented this video mainly because of Sean Connery.  I was  pleasantly surprised: this is a great movie.  It is somewhat similar to Good Will Hunting, but I found this plot more interesting, and less predictable.<br />The storyline basically follows the bond that forms between the two main characters.  I think that the stark contrast between these two(old white reclusive man vs. young black charismatic boy) really adds an intesting angle to the story.  The idea that two very different people can build a relatioship from a common passion (in this case writing) is a fascinating idea.<br />I also like the fact that the films does get into racial issues (stereotypes, mixed race couples, athletes and academics), but they do not form the nucleus of the plot.  Instead, the film focuses more on what it becomes to become great in one's passion, and the risk required to develop a relationship with someone who isn't like you.  The director does a great job weaving these two concepts together throughout the story.<br />I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Good Will Hunting.  Also, if you are looking for a great movie that you might have missed while it was in the theatres- this is probably one of those.
B00005B36H|5.0|It was a long and anxious wait for the latest Tool effort, but well worth it. The first thing you notice is the lack of &quot;singles&quot; or accessible songs which were present in both Opiate and Aenima. Secondly, the songs are lengthy and have long build ups, teasing the listener along the way. Tool create a chilling, disturbing and tense sonic atmosphere with their creative use of icy guitars, spiraling bass lines and tribal drumming. The highlights include the Grudge, Parabola, Disposition and Faaip De Oaid. <br />In short, this is Tools crowning achievement thus far--the sound they were tstriving to achieve with their latter releases and fully realizing on this album. It's a refreshing album in a music scene dominated by shallow, three chord, talentless &quot;rap'n'roll&quot; clowns. I mean, these guys can actually play their instruments, sing in harmony, incorporate soaring melodies and still sound heavy and angry, and most importantly, genuine and sincere. Hats off to Tool, you are the Rock'n'Roll saviors!
B00005B36H|5.0|Most of the time when I buy a new CD I have to warm up to it.  Not the case with Tool's latest release Lateralus.  From the very first track The Grudge, it was obvious it was the work of Tool.  Now, maybe it's me, but it would seem that this album is a little heavier, it's certainly more complicated.  Yes, complicated.  Maynard has written some amazing words and even though disturbing, it's a view most of us seem to share.  As far as the rest of the band, Justin Chancellor's bass is still laying down that all impressive bass line that helped define Tool's sound.  Adam Jones' guitar work is still as good as ever, if not better, going between soft a light melodies to in your face riffs making him one of the best transitional guitarists in the industry.  Now as a drummer, I've paid close attention to Danny Carey.  I thought he had really come out of his shell in the last album making him one of the better drummers out there.  This album is of no exception.  If he proved himself Aenima then he certainly threw down the gauntlet on Lateralus.  If you liked his fill on Forty-six &amp; 2 you will LOVE THIS ALBUM.  Danny should easily be put into the same category as Neil Peart and Mike Portnoy as far as drummers go. <br />Overall.  Get this album.  If you've never listened to TOOL before, get it anyway, you WILL find something you like about them.  If you want to know how to play your instruments well, get this album.  If you're looking for something to which there is nothing else like on the market, GET THIS ALBUM!!!
B00005BL2A|4.0|Not that I didn't like Ultra, but I always thought there was something missing from that album, and I feared that the loss of Alan Wilder had had a tremendous impact on their sound.  I was really worried about their next album.   I'd heard the excerpts on DepecheMode.com and nothing really grabbed me.  But having heared the whole album, let me tell you it is a tremendous breath of fresh air.  Something about it reminds me of Black Celebration in a way I can't explain.  As far a tempo goes, Exciter is somewhere in-between the fast and upbeat Violator and the mellow and foreboding Ultra, and it's a refreshing pace. Dave Gahan's vocals are incredible, he has never sounded better. With one exception, the only word that can describe The Dead of Night is &quot;kooky!&quot; This album comes highly recommended.  Well done!
B00005B36H|4.0|It was clear that this would happen. After their masterpiece Aenema tool's following album could only deteriorate. This almost 80 minutes long album is not as powerful as Aenema and the song-structures cannot be seen clearly, as there are very short tracks followed by very long ones with kinda spheric instrumental parts. Not a bad thing on the whole, but something I ll (hopefully) get used to. Relax. Turn around and take my hand!
B00003XACV|5.0|This album is one of the best works of new music I've heard in a long time - maybe ever.  It is thoughtful, interesting, and reveals increasing depth with repeated listenings.  As if that weren't enough, it *feels* good to listen to.  If you're looking for something to sink your teeth into, something to expand your world a little, this is a great choice.
B00005B36H|5.0|IF your have to get any cd from Tool you have to get this and also if you like this cd get there aneima cd. These are the two best. Maynard is a great singer song writer. I recommend you getting this cd. You won't regret it.
B00005B36H|4.0|i know, i know--i've waited for years for this album to come out, only to give it 4 stars.  well, it really is a lot to take in--the cd i mean, sort of like creation(you really need a numbed time after assaulting the world with your creativity to step back and reassess what you've done).  this cd is going to have to grow on me--which is exactly what is so great about it.  who wants to move through life on automation? at first glance it appears heavier, quieter, more epic, and more challenging than tool's other cds.  the band alternately interchanges jarring structures with nimble moments of soft blue light.  the production is simply extroaordinary.  the sounds that come from the bass, guitars, and drums are sweet, soothing, grating, propulsive, and up front.  david botrill did a superb job.  the cd packaging is beautiful.  a lot of thought went into this recording on all fronts.  it's also easy to see that the band members have really been practicing.  this is their most technically accomplished recording to date in terms of musicianship.  ah, but where would that leave us without emotion?<br />well, there have been a lot of emotions and thoughts triggered, prodded, and seduced out of me from listening to this cd.  thoughts of love, birth, higher consciousness, the future, primordiality, saturn...if this cd prods you in ways you find uncomfortable then i think mission accomplished.  give it time.  if after one hundred listens you don't get it.  listen one more time.  i know i'm going to have to...
B00005B36H|5.0|For those of you who have been awaiting Tool's follow-up to Aenima, you will not be disappointed with Lateralus. Tool retains thier dense, gritty and ethereal sound on this driven installment. Certainly, there is growth in the style of song that Tool has produced. Whereas Aenima, Undertow and Opiate seemed to focus more on concisely arranged songs, Lateralus appears to focus more on creating an epic soundscape. The album is a bit of a departure from Tool's previous work, but it is excellent.
B00005B36H|5.0|This CD has been on my mind for a long time, and finally I got it today. I have already listened to it twice and can say it is just as good as I had hoped. The CD starts out with a blistering song called &quot;The Grudge&quot;. When you get this CD, crank up  the volume right away cause this song throws bolts!! The already relaeased &quot;Schism&quot; is so good and the music is addictive. The last three tracks are one momentus excape into another world! BUY IT NOW!
B00003CXMG|3.0|I have to agree with the other below average reviews after having just seen this, and the lauded performance of Goldie Hawn's daughter pretty much sums up my opinion of the movie: a LOT of hype for very little substance. There is an occasional laugh and reasonably good acting especially by the lead singer, the mentor writer from Creem and the kid weren't too bad.  It seems as if based on many of the reviews, the soundtrack is the real star of this movie which brings up another point.  This assertion that Rock Music was poisoned and a betrayal to its sincere, humble beginnings after 1973 is laughable. Check your CD collection, I bet you've got some music that was made after that that sounds pretty good right? Feel betrayed or that you're being hustled by big bad corporate types when you listen to it?  The only bad thing that happened to Rock at about that time was it was then that the kind of snobbery that still pervades in terms of judging another based on what Rock they listen to began. It's all just subjective rubbish and &quot;Rock&quot; is still just Rock -- not Beethoven or Haydn.
0140277447|1.0|The Chinese in this book are all depicted as victims, people without agency; the Japanese are depicted solely as aggressors. As she adds a work to the growing body of victim studies, Chang never asks some of the most serious questions of all: How could so many hundreds of thousands of people have been slaughtered by so many fewer Japanese troops? While Chang offers third-rate pop psychology to analyze &quot; the Japanese&quot;, she is curiousely silent on &quot;the Chinese&quot;.  This is a typical book journalists would write, not  historians. Unfortunately, people like the former.
B00005B36H|5.0|ITS OUT, AND ITS GREAT...I MEAN IT HAS TO BE!! ITS TOOL!
B00005B36H|5.0|This album continues the brilliant Tool tradition of progressive rock and adds to it three-fold. I'm an enormous Tool fan but I was ready to be completely objective with this album, trying not to let my bias sway my opinion of it--so I listened with fresh ears. Lateralus is stratospheric, its sonic bliss, and I can't recommend any current Rock album more. <br />Danny Carrey's drums pound with tribal ferocity. Adam Jones can do things with his guitar that all these new rock bands couldn't dream of. And Maynard, well his voice continues to soar gently one minute, and tear into your flesh the next. <br />Lateralus feels different from TOOL's previous work, it definately stands on its own, as did each other album--but don't worry, this is TOOL. There's light, flowing songs like Disposition, and hard, thrashing songs like Ticks and Leeches. Triad is fully instrumental, and some of the most incredible guitar work I've ever listened to. They get better with multiple listenings, which in this case is scary, because this is a DAMN good album already...and its staying in my CD player for many years to come. <br />Tool fans will NOT be dissapointed. And if you're a TOOL fan, chances are you have it already so you know what I'm talking about. If you're NOT a TOOL fan, there's no time like the present to enter our dimension, and Lateralus is a great start.
B00005B36H|5.0|Another terrific albulm everyone go out and buy it now. I would describe how good it is but alas i cant. Go listen to it!
B00005B36H|5.0|This album continues the brilliant Tool tradition of progressive rock and adds to it three-fold. I'm an enormous Tool fan but I was ready to be completely objective with this album, trying not to let my bias sway my opinion of it--so I listened with fresh ears. Lateralus is stratospheric, its sonic bliss, and I can't recommend any current Rock album more. <br />Danny Carrey's drums pound with tribal ferocity. Adam Jones can do things with his guitar that all these new rock bands couldn't dream of. And Maynard, well his voice continues to soar gently one minute, and tear into your flesh the next. <br />Lateralus feels different from TOOL's previous work, it definately stands on its own, as did each other album--but don't worry, this is TOOL.

B00005B36H|5.0|Only one word can describe this new Tool album:<br />AMAZING<br />That is all that can be said.
0446677450|5.0|Frankly, I think most personal finance books are cheesy. They remind me of all the goofy sales type I know who have the appeal of Herb Tarlek and respond to want ads for &quot;wild and crazy people needed&quot; as a serious career option.<br />However this book is straightforward in that there are core philisophical difference between the haves and have-nots that cannot be explained in a few paragraphs. If it could, we would all be rich.<br />This book represents the first of my descent into Cheeseville. Please make sure the cleaner has my plaid suit ready - complete with the tie that's too wide and too short.
B00005B36H|5.0|I bought this album not being a huge Tool fan and just buying out of curiosity.  What I didn't expect was musical genius.  It is a difficult album, but it will grow on you I'm sure if you don't like it.  Buy this masterpiece.  Support Tool.  My favorites are:  The Patient, Parabol/Parabola, Lateralis (intentionally spelled wrong.), and Disposition/Reflection/Triad.  WARNING:  Faiip de Oiad will make you fear for your life :) .  Lateralus Forever!!
B00005B36H|5.0|First another masterpiece album from the always inspiring band TOol. First came THe Grudge. Maynard at one point screams for well over 20 seconds, and never does he come up for air. 3 words can hopefully describe this song for you: Heart Stopping Epic.  Second came THe Patient. Yes, please be patient with this song because if you do it will surely grow on you. SOme people have been saying this song is egyptian sounding and it kind of is but with a twist of A Perfect Circle. Maynard goes a bit soft on this one (No Screams Really), but not to say that as a bad thing, cuz it isnt. It just shows how diverse this band can get with its playing style and how well they can do it. And as we know TOol can do all things well :). Great song. Moving on to Schism. Ah, the first single, and a mighty damn good one at that. You've heard it, I don't need to describe this gem to you. Now were at Parabol/Parabola. Here they seem to go back to their roots of Undertow. Its really good, esspecially when they suddenly switch from soft to heavy. Its a great transition. Perfect timing. Ah, now its Ticks And Leeches, Forty Six and Two's sequal, kind of. I never knew Maynard could be so ferocious. WHoever he's aiming at better watch out. Your gonna get hurt. So much heavyness is in this song. SO powerful but so beautiful. Listen to it. Also, be sure to get in the Mosh Pit at this song and see where it takes you. :) Ahh, Lateralus and Reflection. This is new, very New. Try not fainting when you hear these perfect songs. In the Words of wayne and Garth: Were not Worthy. Were Not Worthy. Thank you Tool for releasing this album at this dire point in this low point of music's ever lasting evolution. WIth you guys you raise the bar once again. :0
0679879269|5.0|i loved this book... i have been hooked on this series since 6th grade when i read the first books. i have been waiting for YEARS for this book to come out and i was NOT dissapointed. this is terrific fantasy, very realistically written. i am amazed.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has pleased their fans again!I think this album is even better than aenima,their previous release which maybe span more than 1000 times in my cd player.Beginning from The Grudge ending with a weird hidden track,the music never loses its energy(sometimes angry sometimes cool and atmospheric)till the end.I think this album is a more positive and a more experienced release compared to the previous ones which had a dark and more agressive sound.The songs here generally want to give the listeners something positive about the life(like parabola or grudge...)Tracks are generally long but not boring,always changing their mood and tempo,never repeating the same again,and all tracks have different moods and different atmospheres.The grudge is sometimes angry but generally powerful,not like their usual style(especially intro vocals).The patient is like a counterpart to the long tracks of aenima like push it or third eye with great hollow vocals.Schism has a great guitar riff and powerful vocals.Parabola(one of my favorites)has a powerful style much like Undertow's(i liked its intro riff very much).Ticks and leeches is this albums agressive and angst-ridden vocals.Lateralus is the most gorgeous track,with a fine main riff,interesting vocal style that no words can describe.Reflection is a smooth track with cool ethnic instruments(im not sure but it can be indian or egyptian or something) which takes the listener to different dimensions(this is also another favorite).Other tracks are also cool-most of them without words but full of cool sounds which serve to prepare the listener to the long and challenging songs. Anyway whether you are new to tool or not,buy this album,it will not dissapoint you,its guarantied:))
B00005B36H|3.0|If they had been constantly working towards writing a great record over those 5 years maybe this album would deserve 4-5 stars, but I really think they didn't put a whole lot of effort into it this time around.  It's either that or they just ran out of ideas after the last one which truly was a masterpiece.  Still worth checking out, but not their best.
0385335482|5.0|What a great story this is.  Yes, its light and very fast reading but I just couldn't put it down.  If you love Bridget Jones, then you will also love Becky Bloomwood.  Even if you are not a true shopaholic, you are still bound to find moments when you recognise some of the symptoms.  Havent we all needed to buy some little treat for ourselves when we are down in the dumps, never mind that the credit card is about to self-destruct?  This book just kept a huge smile on my face the whole way through.
B00005B36H|5.0|Having to wait 5 years for this album, it definately is worth the wait.  Something that is quickly noticable is the heavy &quot;surreal&quot; aspect of the album, not unlike 'third eye.'  Instead of having only 15 min of this, we basically have a whole album.  Not only are they able to pull this off well, they have been able to combine the feel of opiate and undertow with this surreal imagery, coming out on top with a more emotional (but still TOOL) sound.  This is their most abstract release, so those 3 1/2 min radio fans out there, it's probably a good idea to stay away.
B00005B36H|5.0|Just received Lateralus today from Amazon.  First impression is very good,  but I knew it would be.
B00005BL2A|4.0|As a DM fan for more than 25 years, I can say that with Exciter the guys missed the mark with this album. It's a decent album but to me it seemed a bit over produced. Perfect example is Freelove. Seven years after this was released I can barely stand to listen to that track when I play the album.     However there are some great tracks here: Dream On; I Feel Loved (great dance track); The Dead of Night, a great grungy, industrial track that reminds you of their old stuff and finally Goodnight Lovers, a song that almost sounds like a lullaby.     Dave's voice never sounded better but I thought some of the songs could have been stronger. Playing the Angel - the follow-up to this album was a much stronger record.    Again, not  a bad album but not among DM's best.
B000059QYB|5.0|Billy Idols Greatest Hits - and they are all here from &quot;White Wedding&quot; to &quot;Flesh or Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Mony Mony&quot;, &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; to &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; and my favorite &quot;Eyes Without A Face&quot;.<br />Brings you back to the 80s, late 80s, early 90s, showing what a songwriting genius Billy Idol was giving us the best rocking, hooks, that money can buy.<br />And other great hits &quot;Dancin' With My Self&quot;, &quot;To Be A Lover&quot; and &quot;Cradle of Love&quot;...the list just keeps going and going.<br />I am so glad that this artist turned his life around to keep giving us good music and becoming a good father to his son Willem.<br />Idol you are one rocker where the girls can love you and the guys think you are cool.<br />Keep rocking.  This is a absolute definite buy for your 80s classic rock music pleasure, and also for those long trips in the car or plane.
B00005BL2A|3.0|Seems I've heard some of this before...I think they gone and put a new cover on Ultra or Songs of Faith and Devotion.<br />Not that this is all that bad. Mark Bell has helped them produce some of the best music they have ever made. The lyrics, however, often lack any innovation. How many times can I hear about putting on &quot;that dress&quot; (&quot;Shine&quot;). How many times can I hear about the &quot;soul brothers and soul sisters&quot; (&quot;I am You&quot;). I could go on with the Depeche Mode lyrical cliches. But I think you get the idea.<br />Dave's voice is certainly the best it's ever been. Even if it isn't as expressive. He is much more melodic and subtle.<br />But the songs that Martin sings are just odd. Can't exand on it. You'll just have to hear them. One is musically and lyrically a bomb, and the other is too mainstream and tired in subject matter. On this album he is best assigned to harmonies, where he and Dave sound better than ever.<br />Not a bad album in general. They even limited the two instrumental tracks to two minutes. Exciter is just dragged down by the sometimes insipid and cliched lyrics.
B00005BL2A|1.0|Depeche Modes latest effort &quot;Exciter&quot; is just awful.  The album from beginning to end is absolutely slow dribble.<br />No hooks or standout songs like &quot;Strangelove&quot;, &quot;People Are People&quot;, &quot;Master or Servant&quot;, just dribble.<br />The production is good, but the energy of this album is so low that you feel it is the end of the world for this band.<br />&quot;Dream On&quot; the first single which right now is a hit on Billboards Club Play chart do to thankfully being remixed to a faster upbeat song is one of the worst songs I have ever heard from Depeche Mode.<br />The rest of the album is just as bad with depressing songs &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;When the Body Speaks&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot; and the ever suicidal &quot;I Am You&quot;.<br />If anything I am now officially over Depeche Mode who I feel peaked in 1989 with &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;.<br />A total disappointment.
B00005B36H|5.0|Bought it the day it came out - have been waiting anxiously for 5 years since their last release.  Suffice it to say that Tool simply does not disapoint. The musicianship is everything that fans have come to expect - that is to say, as complex as anything out there today.  Tool somehow manage to sound completely unlike anyone else out there today.  Amazing band.
B00005BL2A|5.0|Brilliantly crafted album by Martin Gore and Co., my only question is why the title &quot;Exciter&quot;?  While all tracks are mesmerizing and powerful, the majority are quite mellow, therefore the word &quot;Exciter&quot; does not exactly leap to mind after hearing the album all the way through a few times.  With only one truly bombastic track, &quot;The Dead of Night&quot;, I'm left wanting slightly more.  But the overall feeling Gore has created here easily makes up for the lack of excitement.  It demands listening to all the way through, as each track melts into the next.  &quot;Comatose&quot; is a welcome return to the Martin Gore of yesteryear, calling to mind old favorites like &quot;It Doesn't Matter Two&quot; and &quot;World Full of Nothing&quot;.  &quot;Breathe&quot; is nothing short of sublime, done with the same jazzy Twin Peaks charm as &quot;Death's Door&quot;.  And of course Dave Gahan's vocals are in top form, belting out lyrics about twilight's parasites one track - and whispering in our ear about lost love on the next.  Beautiful album.
0792833236|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies ever produced and directed for american cinemas.  The acting is suberb.  Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro are electric together on screen.  They are able to accurately portray their characters while still keeping true to the story of Jake La Motta's life.  The movie is helped by the fact that Jake La Motta was one of the best fighters to ever enter the ring.  His book which inspired the movie, was excellent and enthralling.  Scorcese's use of black and white documentary style filmmaking gives this movie an almost voyeuristic viewpoint into the true life of a great man and the people in his life.
