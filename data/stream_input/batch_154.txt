B00HEPH26O|5|Done a good job. Air in pickup works good now.
B00PMEWET4|5|Quality of my logo excellent and the finesse of the owners sending the company card with their staff was awesome!
B008G3KCHE|5|I was a little Leary buying these for so cheap but they arrived on time undamaged and they bolted right in! Good fit and everything!
B001GJ7HCI|5|Helped me get the stubborn tar off my new car.  Great product.
B00PYCXGQY|5|Best foam pad I have used to date. We use these in our busy detail shop on the Flex DA 3401. Cutting power is excellent
B00DR4C3VU|5|Exactly like my original
B00ALJO826|5|Love love love my helmet!  I wish I measured my head more precisely because I was on the line of the medium and large size and bought the large. It's a little loose, but I took the plastic adjustment piece off the chin strap and that gave me the option to make it a tighter fit.
B0002RNSLY|5|Worked perfectly for my needs and a much better price then buying from the local auto store.
B00546A92E|5|Excellent item for the price
B00SLCWD2W|5|Fast delivery. Exactly what my husband wanted.
B000O82560|2|Same problems as two other comments: clogged with rust and not the usual (typical) style quick disconnect fitting. Quick disconnect is the Star Products (Lang tools) quick disconnect style (NOT the OTC style fitting, or Milton industrial interchange). Already had a diesel test gauge set, so did not want to buy the $150 OTC 5021 gauge. Thought I could just change the quick disconnect fitting, but it is brazed on, NOT threaded. SO I bought a Star Products TU-15-31 Right Angle Diesel Adapter from ToolDiscounter dot com for $9.04, and replaced the male fitting with one in my test gauge set. The new Star (LANG) adapter now bridges the gap between the OTC 6076, and my test gauge. UPDATE: When they brazed on the quick disconnect end, brazing overflowed into the tiny tube. Took a #53 drill bit and drilled out the brazing and flushed with brake cleaner. FINALLY! it worked perfect. The tiny tube is to clear the rocker arm. Whole assembly seems to be hardened so could use a 1/2&#34; open end wrench at the top of the 6076 to snug it into the glow plug hole. What a pain, but it was half price off list......AND it is definitely THE correct adapter tool for the Ford/Navistar 7.3L Direct Injection Turbocharged engine.
B000O5NQOS|4|It was a gift, he loves it
B009MASZ1K|4|Very good product but rather difficult to put up and take down for a short person.  Could use about a 1/4&#34; at the bottom and 2/8th&#34; on either side to completely cover window as shown in picture.
B00EER3FVG|5|These lights are super bright and small. Major upgrade from halogen
B00KN6N91S|5|Received ok. as expected.
B009M5A892|5|Did have to use a torch to open it up some.
B00H38QVDW|4|nice lights that give a &#34;black-light-ish&#34; look to it.  Easy to install, but I kinda wish they were brighter.  that's my only beef with em
B000BUTDCA|5|Nice quality item, works great.
B00QIHJIH0|5|Is ridiculous the light of this light
B001B5E16W|5|Exact fit and made in Japan made me feel good about the parts.  Looks exactly like the oem part it replaced.
B00GU8X7RO|5|Perfect fit bottom fan shroud, 2005 Chevrolet Express van 3500 6.0L
B000U0Z2L2|5|Just great.
B00E4CQ2I4|5|I wasn't expecting much for the price, but I was pleasantly surprised. I needed a plastic framed pair of shades for my car. The ones I was using had metal frames and just got too hot in the Summer heat. These don't get too hot, they look great, and they really cut the glare. And if something happens to them, I'm not out too much money. Very happy with them.
B003YNH88W|5|Works as it's supposed to. What more can you ask for?
B005WG88KQ|5|works very good
B001TFE38A|5|With proper surface preparation this will net you almost a year of protection
B001A4V78E|1|The white part in the picture was red on the one I got. Also the orifice tube was longer. So as a result it would not fit in the ac system.
B00L3E0LQU|5|Best purchase ever! Fast delivery. Love the convenience of have this cargo net!
B00L4TF32G|5|great stiff
B001C4OB8U|4|excellent product
B000BUTD9S|5|Wish I'd seen these with my last camper but better late than never--great little pieces of durable carpeting that are easily held in place on the camper steps to help rub off dirt and sand from shoes and paws to keep the camper cleaner.
B004X8XHZ0|5|Perfect, my husband loved it!
B003SOJVMS|5|This item also is needed to the correct operation of my car,,, Thank you....
B00CEXK6R8|3|Pain in the a$$ to install...wasn't crazy about putting clear tape on hood to protect it from the deflector clips that clamp on...then you have the double sided tape sticking to the painted surface of the hood....hope I never have to remove it! I liked the original deflector that screwed into pre-set holes under the hood....looks nice, but I preferred the &#34;old, original&#34; set up...
B005FEQU3C|5|My mechanic said these are a perfect fit for the rear suspension on my VW Jetta.
B0067EFWTW|3|MOUNTING HOLES ON REAR FLAIRS WERE NO WARE NEAR FACTORY HOLES.  I HAD TO RE DRILL FLARS TO MATCH FACTORY HOLES, IN BOX SIDE.  FRONT FLAIRS LINED UP WITH FACTORY HOLES IN FENDER PERFECTLY.  FRONT AND REAR FLAIRS ACTUALLY FIT THE BODY LINES VERY WELL, AND LOOK  REALLY NICE!!!!
B0075FU2G0|5|Same story as many other buyers.  My 2005 Scion tC key became brittle and the plastic completely separated from the blade.  I was able to transplant the immobilizer chip by cutting the brittle shell with wire cutters.  After much coaxing and bending of the plastic to separate the chip from the old housing I finally got it free.  Some people say use a heat gun, or soldering iron, or hair dryer to soften the plastic and glue, but I brute forced it.  Be sure to mark the chip with a marker or nail polish which side is up and closest to the key blade.  Once the chip is out of the old housing, it fit into the new blank perfectly.  To test, I had my old blade next to the new key in the car.  If the car starts, you didn't break anything!  Now to get someone to cut the new blade and I'm all set.  Be careful when removing the immobilizer chip!  Some people have broken theirs and had to get a replacement coded from the dealer.
B000C5FTSG|5|Worked great, put it in a 1998 Ford Contour, no problems so far.
B00EXIEVO6|5|It arrived quickly and worked perfectly!
B0015S698S|5|The most time saving product I've ever used on refrigerant piping. I have a very large installation with hundreds of feet of refrigerant lines, every time you make a connection there's only 1 weld instead of 2 like when you use a coupling.
B004QOK1VY|5|exlettant, quick delivery
B00CWKMAZO|4|I was a bit skeptical when buying these mainly because of the low price point. The seats in my 2002 ford explorer were getting really worn out and ripped so I figured at under $25 it was worth the gamble. Installation was a breeze, I ended up taking  the seats out so i could remove the trim pieces and get them nice and tight.  Cant beat it for the price, super fast shipping as well.  Not sure about durability, only time will tell.
B0009PSJ22|3|I didn't expect a miracle when buying a product so small and inexpensive. I haven't noticed a difference at all in air quality.
B007TY9Q3C|4|Works well enough.  Is certainly affordable and it did work correctly.  For those that are cutting wires because it seems hard to get into the headliner, all you need to do is to pull the weatherstripping off and pull out one press-fit fastener that will be clearly visible.  With my small hands, I didn't even have to do that.  It's not DOT approved, but what things from China have proper approvals - even when they say they do?
B001A567ME|5|Perfect price
B000CQFS0O|5|GOOD  PRODUCT
B007X8G0TM|5|About 6 months into use and I love them.  Took a couple weeks to break them in.
B00TTPI25M|5|Great
B000FJVO24|5|Comes with everything you need to give a clean install, light bulb is strong enought to read in the dark. Would recommend.
B007YJSCQE|5|Fantastic
B001ECYQTY|5|Nice setup.
B00T36918Y|1|If the material is thin and rips with moderate wind, this product should not be priced so high.
B001EP0GHC|5|excellent
B00FDQPCR2|5|This is got to be one of the most amazing things I bought for my house.  You approach it at night and it will light up to scare the bejesus out of you.  So, don't go where you don't belong.  Perfect light.  Just leave it alone, let the sun charge it all day, and at night, it does its thing, and it does it perfectly.  Buy one, and you will want another.  Good job Sunforce!
B00IUUHH26|5|Easy to install - popped right into place.  2006 BMW 325i series.
B004O844DS|2|It became rusty after a heavy rain fell a week ago. I've used this for just 3 wks.
B000JFJLP6|1|Just used this for the first time on my Mini Cooper. Started up the car just fine but upon releasing the cables, car suffered a power over surge. Radio, AC, convertible roof, cigarette lighter, were all out...  There was no warning about this in the Jump-N-Carry product precautions and jumpstarting instructions which is what I used and followed exactly to jump start the Mini. In fairness upon examining the manual for the Mini after the fact, it was noted rear defroster and lights should be turned on before disconnecting the cables. My bad, but Jump-N-Carry's bad too (they should have mentioned it in either their precautions or jump starting instructions). It has cost me $1200.00 to repair.
B000760FWU|3|I loved them for being light and compact and nice looking, but forget using them for a car. They are too unstable for that. Had to return them.
B000E28KOC|5|This air filter boosted my performance tremendously. My bike is a lot faster now, that OEM air filter was terrible. K&N filters will go in all of my vehicles.
B001OZOY2U|1|the size is not as given
B00JIEX722|5|I installed these for my DC5 front parking lights.  They install easily without any modification.  They must be inserted into the 194 lamp socket using the correct polarity, but this is trivial (if it doesn't light up then re-insert with the bulb contacts rotated 180 degrees.  if neither rotation lights up, then double check the wire leads to ensure they are making contact with the socket metal conductors).  The factory socket in my car provided positive retention so the bulb will never shake loose.  See photos showing  a) LED 194 bulb only,  b) LED bulb + stock halogen H1 low beam, c) LED bulb + H1 low beam + 7440 turn signal. They are brighter than the original filament 194 bulb.  Although not recommended for safety reasons, these LED parking lamps alone are bright enough to drive at low speeds in the dark.  With both H1 and 194 LED my front visibility is definitely improved.  The bulbs may get warm but not hot to touch.  I will check in again later to update their reliability/lifetime.
B000XRHRZQ|5|Love it
B001CEG90I|1|Brought two of these and both cars are experiencing a mold smell in the cabin when a/c is turned on. It causes me and my family to sneeze a lot, Will be replacing ASAP.
B00080QHMM|5|This is a lot easier to use that the old fashion gauge which I had hard time reading.
B00NAQUJ34|4|Arrived in 2 days with Amazon prime which was very nice. It ships from South Carolina as well. The bar arrived well packaged and came with the mounting hardware and light bar (I did not expect a wireing harness). I put it on my 1999 two door Chevy Tahoe but we had one problem. Using the stock mounting brackets it comes with, they did not raise the bar up high enough off the car so the middle section hit the roof due to the curve on my roof. We went to the hardware store and made some extra brackets for these brackets to sit on and it raised it the perfect amount. That is my fault for not purchasing the aftermarket mounts for my Tahoe so I am not too upset about it. The light bar is very bright when properly angled and I am extremely happy with it!
B012XIP074|5|Great lights! I've only had them installed for a few days but they look great! I actually look forward to having more people get in my car just for the compliments. LOL! These bulbs feel really well built. 
B002TIYDX6|5|Good replacement mats, they are very similar to the mats that came originally with my 2008 model.
B00UE3L9M6|5|Excellent
B0009PSA4O|5|High quality mirror.  Great for our boat!
B00S7FZUR8|5|Going to buy another TonnoFold Trifold for my new 2015 Ford 150  Sad to see the other one go with the trade (2012 Tacoma)  yesterday as it was 3 yrs old and I loved everything about it including the fact that it survived 3 harsh upstate NY harsh winters!  Still looked fresh but I did keep it cleaned and treated but outside in the elements!  I have recommended to a couple of friends who love this product also!  This makes the truck look rich also~
B000CONU2O|5|After discovering how difficult and pricey locating a spare wheel for my car was, I decided to buy wheel locks.<br />McGard quality was my first choice! The excellent polished finish and low profile of these locks blend perfectly with my original chrome wheels!<br />I would recommend these locks to anyone looking for piece of mind for their ride!
B00JMUKIHO|4|It looks great. However,  for radio reception, there is a reason my mx5 came with a two foot antannae.
B003QVMTX6|1|Bad wiring on one of the motors. Lasted for 2 weeks.
B00AFVCMG4|5|fits my 2015 Subaru Legacy perfect.
B005JU5VH8|5|IT POURED IN THE UP AND THESE KEPT THE WINDOW SPOTLESS!
B0052FRT2A|5|work perfectly
B000C7XX78|3|Cars idling really badly and doesn't seem to be working properly
B00PQZPMYI|1|Crappy fit, said it fit Ford truck not worth the $$
B00JQVS2L8|5|Works perfectly!
B00UO80ULW|3|Double check is wasn't the right TR color for my car
B000YPR4YG|5|Worked as expected.
B003STUY8I|5|I now have two entry door mates. One for the stoop at my main door and one for the pad inside the main door before the steps leading to my second floor apartment door. Now in the future I will order one more entry mat for outside my apartment door just because I like to be artsy and sportive in my own fashion.
B00S75A5L4|1|One side always overheats no matter what I do and turns off then on
B00L844JBI|5|Much cheaper than OEM and look great!
B00LW8VWHO|5|Looks and fits perfectly thanks
B00IO4EYMY|5|great deal
B00LO0M918|5|Bought these for my camper.  They work great.  I will purchase more.
B00F8GXK1W|5|This fits amazingly well, very snug, for my Mazda CX-5. The color matches my car, even! Shipment and packaging were perfect.
B0085IJN4I|4|Does a great job at blocking light and heat. Does not easily accommodate the crank handle and therefore the fit isn't all that great (the cushion extends below the roof line on the side where the crank-handle rests).
B0002KKHS8|5|Amazing product, the seats look great.
B008QM1EBI|5|Good price fast shipping
B002PP5E5Y|5|nice hat, fits good
B00IWNUMAA|5|I wonder if it works for a sl12000 saturn
B000CN4XWQ|1|Faulty 180 Degree Thermo Switch, fans turn on at about 205 degrees, over rode by putting in a fuse and bypassing switch for now.
B000PEWDKG|5|I've used this and another 3M sealant product on automotive seams and it nearly replicates the factory material (although I am not as neat!). Excellent product.
B00EK5EVBK|3|Only reason why I give it three stars is because for some reason the drivers side blinker doesn't work properly at times. There's a 50/50 chance of it working and then once it doesn't work it won't for the rest of the day. Looks great though
B0031I0NAU|5|Worked!
B005FRC132|2|The reason why I gave this item 2 stars is because a all the sea tresses the covers they make them directly the same as the front seat so they don't fit the backseat another thing the backseat cover the bottom and the top is exactly the same piece they're not different I specifically put for a Kia Rio in the seats does not fit on the Kia Rio it was lots of selling in lots of cutting to make the seats fit I could have made of my own if I just went and got the material so that's why you get a bad review I wasn't give no stars but I felt like I should give something
B004RU9RT4|5|The gloves are really good quality for the price. I use them as mechanic's gloves and they're pretty durable. I like the fingerless tips because it makes it easier to grab onto small objects like nuts, bolts, washers, etc. I use the first pair for mechanical applications, and the second pair for just casual wear. Highly recommend these gloves. Can't beat them for the price!
B00PL4HROC|5|Insane drop on my B7 Audi A4. Easy to adjust and great coils all around!
B000CN7B5C|5|Good product all around for me because they fit my 1997 F-150 and my 1970 Camaro SS 396. I will be buying a half dozen of them soon. The material they are made of should outlast the rubber ones on both my p/u and car, and the ones on my p/u lasted 17 years and the ones on my car are 45 years old.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|I have had the opportunity to test in several of our cars and I must say that I am very satisfied with this small tire pressure gauge.  I was using a Michelin tire gauge which lasted me for at least 30 years.  I was looking for the same tire gauge from Michelin but only found a digital one.  I prefer the traditional one so browsing through the internet, I found the Jaco Deluxe Tire Pressure Gauge and decided to give it a try.  I like very much, it has a nice feel to it, it is compact in since (one of the main pluses for me), and I don't have to rely on batteries to operate it  Only hope it lasts me long as my previous Michelin gauge.
B000CPI5Z0|5|I suppose it worked...
B004DSA2Z8|4|Bad hose otherwise good product. Fast shipping.
B0074ZL828|5|Top quality grips and arrived crazy fast

B00KANR3AC|5|Got this for my brother to put on his bike. Looks and sounds great!
B005PCBOU8|5|beats getting original audi items at ridiculous prices... getting all my gear at amazon and ebay!
B000FPZRQ2|5|Nice prouduct
B007RHX4D4|5|Arrived timely and fit perfectly...
B001N88E2O|3|The adapter is a cheap piece of junk, so it no longer massages or heats up, but the actual back support is awesome, so I still use it for that.
B000EQW1AC|5|PERFECT! this item should come in the glove box of ever GM car, they go bad ALWAYS! Intermittent lighting issue and this part solved the problem! Easy to install, no tools needed. and the packaging this came in was unreal! thank you Amazon
B00H6ETIWY|4|Work exactly as described.  As others have mentioned, it would be nice to have a detent to return to position after moving.  But for the $ spent, they are excellent.
B00K96WGRK|5|Direct drop-in replacement for the Rascal. Works great. The best part was the price!
B001DZFZPG|5|works
B000FOL0AA|5|Nice addition for the cargo bar.
B000EDSSDO|4|Works just fine and easy to install.
B00URSCLF2|5|CHANGED THE STRUTS ON MY TUNDRA. NO PROBLEMS, GREAT TOOL, WOULD RECCOMEND TO ANYBODY, THAT NEEDS AN EXTRA HEAVYDUTY SPRING COMPRESSOR.
B00029WVL0|1|it shacks when driving car
B00RPP67VO|5|Perfect! Love sporting this on my car.
B007H8DKJG|4|Fits a 2001 Tahoe 4.8l SFI engine perfectly.
B0058VFNHQ|3|One of the fog lights doesn't stay on like a wire is loose. That's straight out of the box. Instructions suck! The wiring isn't as specified. They look good though.
B00D196LZ0|4|Just as ordered, although it was a cut out from a big sheet, but its on the car and getting a lot of laughs!
B00029WYEY|5|Works great !!
B00455O0GQ|4|Very slow delivery from China, but fit and fixed my chainsaw.
B005FL2T3A|5|great product for the money.
B00DNGEI9M|4|Good quality  easy to install
B001EP2904|1|I put in this into my Curt 1 1/4 hitch.  It fell out and was lost within 48 hours.  I had one like this on my Subaru before (factory hitch and cap) and it never fell out after 14 years.  What a piece of junk.  They should refund me.
B00N5GG7ZI|5|love it
B00R54ULN0|5|They are great so far.
B00Q8P9ZVG|5|love it
B00HZB5VZ6|5|this is perfect for &#34;visitors&#34; that park where they shouldn't
B00BYH6C1E|4|Worked as  expected.  Slips low after time but easily adjusted.
B0062IJOJ2|4|Great product. They were installed in a hour.
B009QLBDSW|5|great product!
B000GZNEHK|5|Great buy and works great.
B00N1E7LOK|4|Fit my Jetta 2014 although both the front and passenger vents required some trimming.
B00JBJ3ST6|5|Great headlights. Best bang for the buck with great styling.
B0058V9CF0|5|This fits well in my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  I had to trim some of the edges.  No crazy tool required just a pair of scissors.  Simple and easy install.  Perfect!
B00P7G82TS|2|I got one of these when my pioneer 2700B blowout after using pioneer for years i decided to try something else.The deck is neatly built and look nice, functions ok and the packaging the was good. my one total disappointment was the playing of radio up to this day. i have not been able to get that radio playing without static which is all you can hear at some times. I've tried many different options including buying a booster for the antenna which did not help.
B000EVYGZA|5|Awesome
B00GBVHPNW|5|Perfect fit,great service
B009SWAR72|5|fantastic value!
B005VSIHHE|4|It was good quality but it didn't come with any instructions on how to adhere it. I also didn't like have that sent it. I received my item in a regular envelope that read, &#34;DO NOT BEND&#34; on the back of it. I didn't even know that it was the decal. I threw it on my bed with the rest of my mail and continued studying. Then after a day I checked and read my mail and discovered that one of the letters had my decal in it. It wasn't a very secure and protective packaging. It was also sort of small. But the quality was good. I threw it away after a while when I realized that it was a huge Illuminati symbol.
B002UC1AWS|5|Push and turn, install was a breeze, no complaints yet.
B009DJTKGO|5|OEM part. Easy to install and a great price. Anyone can install it!
B00D1CQVIY|5|This Harness came in complete, really simple to install I do recommend it
B00JPMIKY2|2|Took weeks to arrive from China and then visibly defective when delivered.  Choke plate obviously binding.  A conscientious quality control inspector would have seen it immediately.<br /><br />I thought that buying a carburetor from this supplier would save the time and aggravation of rebuilding the old one, but I was wrong.  I tried installing it as is, but the choke kept sticking in the closed position.  So, I had to remove and file down the choke plate to keep it from binding.  Took forever to get that little screw back in.<br /><br />Fit and fixed the chainsaw once I fixed the carburetor.<br /><br />Not an expensive item, but it would have taken only a second to inspect it at the factory.
B00WY40J9C|5|Speedy delivery.great gift
B00PC0G07A|5|Have patience with the installation.  My Passat is almost 10 years old and the leather steering wheel was past slick, even after cleaning with expensive leather cleaning products.  It took a little over an hour to lace this product onto my wheel.  Wonderful.  I should add that I'm a Senior and not about to go to a gymkhana this weekend.  I just didn't like how slippery the steering wheel had become.  This was a wonderful, quality solution for under $10.
B00RNLAMS4|5|works great , came in perfect order.
B0002Q7ZKK|5|Worked great on my 1987 Toyota 4Runner with just a minor modification to the wire that leads from the passenger side to the drive side.
B01018K73K|5|Hell yah because this clown is going all the way!!
B000E7DLM8|5|great product!
B00VR6ZXR6|5|Perfect... It was what I expected
B00D9C2CDO|4|Great bag, I actually wish it was a little bigger but I got most of the stuff I needed in it. The guys review that said to use 2 ratchet straps in front and behind if you don't have cross bars, excellent! There are a lot of dumb people out there that don't know how to use ANYTHING, I'm sure they had problems. I packed it full to it's maximum capacity on my Pilot and it poured down on my way to Florida, and back. Dry, no probs!
B002WIZYX6|5|Excellent
B00AB2PBU6|5|Although these were only for the front bucket seats of my Honda Civic, they nicely did the job. I put these both on within 5 minutes. They fit over your headrest, this was fine for me. They look rich and fit the bucket seats firmly and snug. Very satisfied...
B000C540CM|5|Okay here is what I mean, I bought this along with my inner/outer tierods, pitman arm, and droparm. Then I just used a pickle fork to bust off the outer tierods from the spindles, pulled the pitman arm off and took the two bolts out of the droparm. This kept the entire assembly in the last alignment position and all I had to do is copy the new stuff's length with the old (beyond worn out) assembly.<br />Now it isn't 100% but if it isn't 95% at least I'll eat this center link. All I have to do after finishing dropping my truck is take it for an alignment and with being about the same as before there is no worry about getting it to the shop.<br />Now mine was only $34 and I'm keeping the old one (refurbishing it for the next time WAY down the road) so if I ever have to do this again I'll have an extra. I haven't broke lose the old rods to check the hole diameters in the center link but I have sizes from the new one to determine if the old one is still usable cause everything under there has 140,000 miles on it and was non serviceable. If it isn't usable then I saved a lot of time by not waiting for this to arrive. As I see it for $34 it was a win win all around.
B001URKV0G|4|Good product for applying dampening material to hard to reach place. Spay head and the removable  nozzle worked fine. The removable nozzle allows the product to get into otherwise hard to reach areas.
B00WR99152|5|I don't write reviews much or promote things but this stuff works!  So glad I found it!!!  spray on and wait about one minute and rinse.  All brake dust and residue are gone.
B00BHD4ZWS|5|Great look beautiful on my go badge license holder
B00XZ9OLDA|5|Works prefectly, connected with my car easily
B00TUKYM82|3|the material is not the best quality i don't think it will last that long the only reason I  kept it was because of the price I paid for.
B00FS0WFAA|4|Simple but gets the job done
B007XUIXI6|2|Doesn't fit my 2006 acura tl the shaft is to long So I had to use the old shaft bye taking of the old starter and install on the new starter not fun but I got it done
B00P3SL35K|5|It works much better than I expected! But do check hose clamps before putting into use. Mine were loose as well.
B00NB8TLOY|5|These LEDs are awesome. I like the outcome from stock warm incandescent light bulbs to modern brighter colder light.<br />Kit says its for interior so I cant blame nobody, but i was hoping itll include the light for the license plate. I still have few left as its 8 piece my CRV only used half of it. really. I managed to get the 8 led pieces in the back seat ceiling and rear trunk ceiling lights, couple 4 led pieces to the front as map lights, the brightness is doubled now inside the car and its more cool than old yellowish lights.<br />Im satisfied with the interior led kit and the seller! It arrived fast! Thanks! :-)<br />Edit: Please do not attempt to mount one of tha spare Light bulbs onto License plate lighting purposes. After Ive done that I came to issue I wasnt aware of and could cost me if I wasnt told by the driver who let me know at the traffic lights that the tailights did not work. I tried to pinpoint the cause and even tho theres really not a lot of topics, i found one where it exactly stated that trying to put the LED light bulbs into License plate housing without proper polarity setting, it will burn out the fuse. Duh! Fuse was burned and so I had to buy a spare fuse kit. DONT DO IT!
B00WVJQO58|2|Bulbs get one star.  OPT7 excellent customer service takes the sting out and raises it to two stars.  The H4 version of this bulb does NOT produce light in the same pattern as an OEM H4.  In an OEM H4, light is sent ONLY UP when on low, and in ALL directions when on high.  This bulb sends light essentially in all directions for both high and low, meaning 1) you get a very similar pattern on high and low, and 2) you will blind oncoming traffic at night as shining ONLY UP is key for the headlights to have the nice low pattern with a well-defined cutoff.
B00SGGF4A6|5|works great. I am using it for 12v landscape lighting.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Great price , unexpected quality & durable . I bought these for my tractor because loader & plow often block original equipment lighting . Lights are very bright & should hold up good through low branches
B00Z0EE5HU|1|Not worth a crap! We bought these to use on 1000 mile trip to Florida for the kids. The picture looks great...put your Mcdonalds meal on there, stuff it full of gadgets...forget it. Very flimsy, the tray will not hold much of anything. It is not sturdy at all. I would not recommend this at all.
B006FUT0CS|4|It works well, it's great for quick clean up with light dust, but it doesn't beat a good old fashioned hand wash and wipe down, it's good for me because in live in an apartment building and my truck is garage kept, it' gets a little dust here and there
B006IIPT4U|5|Classy
B000IY4BIK|5|perfect fit
B002PQW4SI|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ
B0035R0TEC|5|Quality filter easy to install fast delivery
B008G3KG70|5|These are nearly identical to OEM lamps.  They were harder to install than I was led to believe, the grill had to be loosened.  Still, they look fantastic and if you include the cost of bulbs (they each came with one installed) it's cheaper than many of the rejuvenating kits.  Will definitely use these again if needed.
B00OAC7CE6|1|I had no problem with the shipping. It arrived within 3 business days.<br />The frame was a cheaper plastic than I had hoped for. The decal was smaller than I thought and seems like it will come off easily.<br />For the price I paid I expected much more. I would recommend other 5.0 frames
B002VZSSM4|5|100% as suspected
B000CPI032|2|I ordered multiple cans. I used one partially, cleared it, and went to use it a week later and nothing came out.  It was still approximately 80% full, but it was either clogged or out of aerosol as no paint would come out.  I'm currently using the second can and it is working fine so far. Good coverage and it doesn't take much to coat the item (I was painting an engine block and heads).  The low star rating is primarily for, what I think, is a defective can.
B004ZO3VN0|5|Good stuff if you tune for it
B001KS6FPA|5|Worked just as expected, and it fits our Subaru Forester, as advertised!
B00KYW09Z0|5|worked great easy to program
B005CDNCQO|5|perfect replacement!
B000COS06U|5|Good looking and works perfectly.  The lock fits well and is solid and secure when loosening and tightening the lug.
B0050VGZLM|5|We are constantly misplacing remotes and were thinking about buying expensive replacements of each. So thankful to have found this handy little device instead. We use it often and works every time! We save so much time and frustration since buying. I love that they come with extra batteries and adhere well to the remotes. Even small children haven't pulled the locators off. The locators are small enough not to be bothersome when attached. We use them on apple tv, Roku, amazon fire, surround sound and TV remote. Great product, highly recommend!
B00PLDR400|4|Bright and very clear light, good construction.
B00NTGLP1A|5|got it quick and fits perfectly, quality looks great.
B00VWFIBSA|4|work in the mist and love it!!
B000L9QRE8|2|Locking mechanism froze up after I bought it.
B00SW4W7RA|4|Great quality, but it's smaller than the factory decals.
B00BLYX7MC|1|Wrong Parts for Car But the App. Said they Fit !  Then Try getting a Refund from Amazon ! It's Horrible !
B000TRBIG4|5|Great stuff
B00O3QB67S|5|The mirror is very good. It took all those blind spots away. It is a very good quality. Clipped on my Subaru Forester mirror easily. For the money I paid it is an excellent product. The objects seem to be a bit further away in that mirror, but I don't find it bothersome. Of course, you should not expect miracles, it's just a wide mirror.
B002ZTGLCK|5|The line seems to be holding up just fine. Not too stiff to install.  Holds good seals though
B0049IPSMY|1|This cover only lasted me one year. This cover rotted and it was not covered under the warranty. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B00VJ2RJWK|5|Way better than expected - Priced right!
B003PJOEXM|4|Yeah, good luck threading the middle bolts through the bumper of a 2012 Equinox. Since I'm just using for bike carrier I didn't put the middle bolts on. Besides that, it's a good product and does what I need it to do.
B0050SFZBG|3|If you have a large radiator hose to take off.. This is the tool. On smaller hoses (1/2&#34; or smaller) I would not advise using the tool.
B00B1F0INW|5|I have the 2015 RAV4 and I haven't had any problems with the net staying on the hooks. It has worked perfectly for me.
B00G4AB4MS|4|Hole did not line up with my factory hicth, had to grind off a 1/4 inch, but other than that, very solid, heavy, secure.
B00KZ2YBRG|5|Awesome
B0046VSI8K|5|Super quality!
B000RFUF12|5|Excellent product
B00ZRYU9GE|5|These kits are full elk. Must buy before sold out!
B00JZFS50S|4|Perfect fit very bright look very good clean white lights couldnt be happier with product
B002QGVW3K|5|right battery for my granddaughters car. I wish all things were this simple. Arrived very quickly and packaged so no problems would arise
B008IEFA0U|5|always need as seem to disapeare all the time
B00XV4W686|5|I could not believe how bright these LED lights were after installing them.  Please make a note in the future.....if your vehicle calls for an 1156 type bulb, do not try and install an 1157 type bulb.  This is what I did, not being aware of the difference and being stubborn.  I forced 1157's in at first and was disappointed they were so dim.  I have come to know now of the protruding bumps on the sides of the bulbs.  These &#34;bumps&#34; need to make contact with the walls of the socket.  With the 1157, only one side was making contact, hence the dimness.  I realize some out there are laughing at me and possibly calling me a dumb ars  LOL  I can take it and agree.  Please be patient and do the proper research.  If I had, I would have saved myself a lot of time and effort.  I am very very pleased with these bulbs as my rear turn signals!
B00J4PHH30|1|R1 Concepts description of this product is accurate and it is a very good product. HOWEVER... Amazon's &#34;Garage&#34; tool told me these were the correct rotors and pads for my vehicle when in fact they were not. I entered my vehicle info into Amazon's garage tool including the 3.6 engine (not 2.5.) Amazon's tool then showed me that these fit. EXCEPT they do not. They fit the 2.5 model only. Again this is not R1s fault this is an amazon problem. Unfortunately I did not realize until I was driving down the road and one of my brake pads popped out due to the thinner rotor. I was lucky and no one was killed when I temporarily lost breaking power. I am interested to know if amazon will pay the 600.00 shop bill I am having to pay for new rear brakes and a caliper now. Again R1 is great but do not trust amazon's garage tool. Only trust the manufacturer description.
B00BITR4TM|3|This product, as it came, did not work with my 1998 Toyota Sienna XLE.  There is a retaining slot (that the housing of one end of the steel cable used to actually open the door slides into) that had too narrow a width to insert the housing.  I spent about 20mins filing that slot wider so it would accomodate the housing.  Then it worked.
B0046I3I8I|1|These are just cloth not a good sorse for stopping sun sun i don't think. will use them but will double up to do better protection.
B004P1WNUU|5|Great quality, lightweight material. Easy to install.
B00PMA0MU6|3|I love everything about this helmet except the one deal-breaker; the Microlock chin strap. Instead of a webbed nylon strip with double D rings Nolan has a ratchet system that relies on a hard plastic tab that is inserted into a locking mechanism. It works perfectly and finally it is possible to fasten up even with gloves on. But. The tab digs right into my adams apple. It's incredibly uncomfortable. I have a fairly thick neck at 17 inches so maybe if you have a thin neck it will be OK. Bottom line is you should try this on before buying or be prepared for paying for the return shipping.<br /><br />Very disappointed because there is so much to like. The visibility in all directions is best I've seen. When visor is up it hugs close shell so no sail effect. In fact this helmet is approved for visor-up riding and has a visor lock on the cheek (note the P and J switch. J means &#34;Jet&#34; and that locks the visor up.)
B0041CAC4W|3|Probably wouldn't buy again if I had the choice.  It doesn't come down far enough so the wind curls under right into your eyes.
B00PYB2MZ6|5|These things are sweet. Bolted right on to my 2003 Suzuki TL1000R
B000JK21YY|5|totally pleased with this product
B00OC4MJNG|4|These are very large so you may need to cut them to size. They do bubble a little but it doesn't bother me.
B00DSD79BE|2|colors fade
B00GRHSU5C|3|It doesn't really give you shade, the sun still passes through the netting. I live in Laredo Texas where the heat is about 110* degrees in the summer and the sun is unrelenting, so if the sun shines through a &#34;sun shade&#34; than it's not that practical
B00RW4P2DM|5|EXCELLENT ADDITION TO MY RAV4 2008
B007PMY3MM|5|These seat belt covers really did the job.
B0096YR4N2|4|Very happy with the license plate frame!😊
B004A0TJGW|5|The separator works like it should
B0040DXAWI|5|So useful. This snapped on over our existing rear view mirror. In our 2006 Honda Element, this eliminates all of the blind spots. I added a small convex mirror to each side mirror as well because I'm very safety conscious. This mirror is pretty wide, so it can be awkward trying to move the window shades without disturbing the mirror. That's rarely an issue for us, but it's something to keep in mind if you're used to flipping the driver side visor up & down all the time.
B00IAECX80|5|Fit is perfect and noticeably keeps the interior cooler!
B008M7IIIY|5|Quality piece.
B005FYMMPW|4|Looks good but have not used it. Appears to be well made
B00LNN3MRQ|5|This is one of the essential components to install when trying to improve trigger pull on Glock pistols.  I have this installed on all of my Glocks.
B0035RZ280|5|Great, accurate and low price.
B001KSEIJ0|5|Worked good thanks.
B00652G4TS|5|It's a very useful scan tool just wish it had a little more features such as command controls
B003EOZLEO|5|They look great<br />Very easy install
B007HCHXYA|5|Fast shipping perfect for mattress
B00J4P4N28|5|Break so beautiful but they get a little rusty. will recommend.
B003KRBKC2|5|great
B00KPR031E|4|Good speakers for the money. Not your Bose speakers but sound decent.
B0029F5H52|3|Good product!
B000NBKI7Q|5|This fits a 1997 Plymouth Grand voyager with the 3.3liter v6 engine. I was replacing the serpentine about every 4 months due to squeaking.  The new belts are so cheap they don't last. This kit corrected the issue of a misaligned tensioner pully. Getting the new belt on was a bear! I had to loosen teh alternator, push it back to teh firewall to get enough slack to get teh belt on. Once on, it has been working fine. It has been on my car for about a year now and still no squeaks, no need to replace the belt. Thank goodness!
B000CIXO9O|4|I had to purchase 2 additional 2&#34; clamps. Pleased overall.
B004BSNO8W|5|Excellent refill that fit easily on to my original fill hose.<br />One can recharged my 2001 Sienna with some left.<br />Second time user
B007HRQF3K|4|good item
B00JLJOWBO|4|It works well so far.
B002P8KUKU|4|Super fast delivery, It fit perfectly, can't beat the price!!!!
B00B9HFO0Y|4|Item was received very quickly and undamaged.  There was nothing to instalation and it worksvery well.
B001LR61BI|5|Great!!!
B0039YWT80|5|Improves sound output into vehicle.
B000AAMY86|5|Excellent mounting instructions, easy hookup, and pretty accurate when compared to the vehicle's own mileage trip computer.  The battery gauge helped out as well - I thought the battery seemed a bit weak, and the gauge showed &#60;13 volts with the engine on. Took the truck to a battery shop and they confirmed the battery was failing and didn't have much longer to last.  Changed out the battery that day, and probably saved my wife from getting stuck somewhere and a AAA call.<br /><br />It's quick and easy to mount and can measure up to four functions at a time - saving me the trouble of buying and mounting a separate voltmeter, water temp meter, etc...<br /><br />Also used it to reset check engine lights after a vehicle service, and to pull engine codes.
B00C1YI2XA|5|great
B007ZMELII|4|Stretches after a while
B001DOO17K|1|The suction cups don't always stay connected. The shield starts to sag with only a little use. It is on the back window of my Prius.
B00ASBRIP6|5|Good
B00404WDUC|5|works great
B001L29CFU|5|Once the correct mount was sent it was an easy fit. (first to arrive was for a Toyota Camary).
B006WQSZW6|1|This product did not last a year. Dealing with Detroit auto I had to make two calls to them. One I was on hold for 10 minutes before it just hung up. The second call was 8 minutes and was able to speak with someone. The warranty was to put up a deposit and they would send me a new one. The shipping was $12 each way. They would inspect it and decide if it was a manufacture defect or if I abused it. So at the end of the day it would cost me half of the price to replace the cheap part and hope that they don't just say I drove down a bumpy road. They did tell me that would be a sign of abuse. Spend the little extra and get the right quality part. Its not worth replacing once a year.
B000CO7W6Y|5|Good
B00B50HO7Q|5|worked great to replace the vacuum operated petcock on my 1996 Suzuki.
B000MW8QKW|5|Works as Described!
B001F0KP7C|5|Works fine on my Volvo Penta outdrive.  Much better solution than the standard slotted plug which is a pain to remove.
B00G620ZVU|5|I am still in the process of installing the lights. I was looking for a low cost way to mount the lights on the tubular metal frame of the center counsel on my boat. Tried EMT 3/4 inch standoffs. Just did not look professional. I ordered  2 mounts from Amazon.com for about $ 10.00 each. I have installed the mounts and they have a more professional look. Thinking out options to route the wires. For the money I have invested I do not believe you can find a cheaper light and mount combination ( less than $50.00)  If I can updated this review at a latter time I will post a photo of the completed project.  I give the lights 5 stars just on price alone!
B004GFS2C8|5|Worked as expected. Just follow the instructions
B00278LRGY|3|Fit was a bit tight on the turbo inlet, could have used another 1/8&#34; in diameter. We'll see how it resists oil
B0066SLQG2|4|Was just a bit long, but fit right in there. In spite of what you may have been told, this IS possible to put on without removing the intake and all that fuel stuff. You do need to remove the debris cover and obviously the spark plug cover. It took me all of 15 minutes and it was done.
B00MG9D1G8|5|Installed on my boat. Buy in pairs. Look great and are heavy duty.
B006CPMCB2|5|Worked perfectly and looked like new.
B00CIVCJWQ|3|This is actually a REIN brand hose which is Continental's lower end &#34;value line&#34; FYI
B004MDT8MW|5|great stuff.....
B00SBZAG5U|1|I really wanted these to be good quality, especially after all the positive reviews, yet I have to 100% agree with the negative reviews, especially for $50 for two of them.  As others have said, the sides are not polished, yet just not the sides, the front where they start to bend is also unpolished and is visible installed.  In addition, the hooks in the back which are supposed to secure the plate to the frame are bent so far back there is no way they can hold the plate in place against the frame to look flush.  I installed one and there was nearly a 1/4-1/2&#34; gap between the plate and the frame on the bottom.  I tried the other frame and same thing.  I have never left a 1-Star review for anything, yet for $50 these are not worth $5.  My current cheap sports team frames look better and are higher quality.  I think I paid $15 for those five years ago.  RETURNED.....
B009XQ676S|4|It fit and the cars owner likes it.
B00ZQ0U7J8|5|Good
B000NW4PO2|5|Looks like these are NGK ILTR5C11 plugs that are assembled in the USA by AC Delco. Pretty sweet deal as those plugs are twice as much.
B00NMRSPDM|5|it arrived sooner than expected and was exactly as described
B007TYEGOG|5|Fit perfectly and looks great. After I changed the headlights, the new headlights made the old park lights look worse than I had realized. For the low price, I changed them as well. They fit fine once getting the old ones out. It seems the old ones mounting hardware has stuck over time. Once out, the new ones went it easily. They did not come with new bulbs, so while I was at it, I went to the store and got new bulbs. Made the truck look almost like new.
B000NVW1LM|4|Slowed the leak but not completely
B00DP3Y6IG|5|Greta fit<br />Great company
B00LHMXOIU|1|wasnt for usa air fitting cant fine the right fitting to fit it
B00AAGR6E2|5|Matched up perfect. USPS delivered it in 4 days on a holiday weekend! Awesome!<br />Took maybe 30 seconds to hook up!<br />CA to MS in 4 days- that's awesome!
B00DRZDENK|2|It falls off
B00080QHMM|5|Works well. easy to read. shuts off automatically. whats not to like about it.
B0024E6IXI|5|Very Happy with it!
B00O3OI1ZU|4|Looks great, however I can not get it to stick properly to my window..
B00W2F6T4M|4|Missing tape of one side. But good quality.
B001URT0YO|2|These were really quite large.
B000E4HIZ2|4|Easy to install.  Seems the motor is a little on the weak side.
B00ABZBRGU|5|These are so awesome... i really love them. At first I thought they were not going to work because the butterflies were upside down. I was able to twist the butterflies and I am completely satisfied!
B00CROVY02|5|Used them for our camper....worky good long time...did the trick
B000VHM19A|5|I got tendinitis from playing volleyball and this definitely helped me with my therapy and recovery, definitely gives u peace of mind knowing that your shoulder is being supported
B000C9QJLI|5|Fits perfect
B000CPCC3Q|5|Good, no complain ...
B00NGOVDDK|5|It worked
B005SU6GMS|5|Excellent price and quality.
B005GYRKEY|5|almost a year since i got them and i'm happy got them for 90 for the set and its 90 for just the long one, i changed them all out and they are great still.
B000OKTFL6|5|Perfect replacement for the faucet on my sailboat.  Has a shower diverter.
B000CIRA1M|1|Should have a 90* elbow so you can actually read it..
B0068C6HF6|5|Nice and perfect bag
B00MC7H3LS|5|After buying several products this one is by far the best. It lights up the light housing in 360 degrees as well as outward with the projector lens. Fantastic true red color. The only bulbs i could find with a strong difference between low power (tail lights at night)  and high power (when braking) modes. Definitely buy this!
B0046NUOLM|5|Great...very fast
B00NTJN6VE|3|A really light aluminum.<br />There is a problem with the wall inside when fitting it together over the handlebar, the wall is got a section the it shaves at inside when turning it and gets stuck once in a while.
B008JWBBLI|5|Very nice.. It preserved the look of the FJ by not covering the grille.  The build is solid.
B00OTK5JHG|3|My old one from two year ago died.  Used it monthly to polish and wax my black 300C.  It rocked!  This one, while slightly more comfortable to hold, occasionally bumps the surface being waxed because of the bend in the handle.  Plus the &#34;new&#34; thinner pads suck.  They soak up wax and are basically trash after a couple of uses.  The old larger pads were much much better, giving me monthly usage for almost two years out of each pad (ylw, mrn, and blk).  The best thing about this is the locking trigger button.  Get the older model, it's much better.
B00EKPOG10|5|very good
B0056OFWVM|5|After owning sports cars for the last 10 years, my husband and I recently bought a new Tacoma. It has been great for Costco trips and hauling stuff in the bed, but I recently bought a vintage desk and needed it to be transported securely.<br />I researched and researched (admittedly more than I probably needed to for ratcheting tie-downs) and finally decided that these retracting tie-downs would be best for storing in the cab and not having the excess tie material getting tangled.<br />These are easy to operate and my desk made it home safe and sound. We'll have to see how they stand up to use over time, but I'll update review if my rating changes from 5 stars.
B00SWGPT14|5|It was heavy material. ...just what I was looking for. I love it!! £
B00DBENXYM|5|Thank you
B004GCPGMU|5|It fit great thanks
B0067ED4ME|4|First time trying this filter. Not sure how well this filter works yet but the fitment was excellent and easy to install.
B00NTUU8FA|5|looks good
B0007RVLAE|5|This stuff does a fantastic job on both my foam pads and my plush microfibers. It is concentrated, so this gallon should last for a couple of years easily. Very economical compared to the other choices available.
B0095ZG2MG|5|well what can I say It works , i got it fast , not much else really to say .
B000F6F99G|5|great idea great product
B00HZGT210|5|well what can I say It works , i got it fast , not much else really to say .
B000CLQRMM|2|very misleading information: &#34;Notes: Two Converter Bodies; LH, RH&#34; But there is only one now i have to buy second one
B001H1O688|1|Did not fit for model year
B000E0Z6NM|5|Great stuff.
B000S0I9IM|3|It say that these headers works with angle plug, they do not.
B0070CWE64|2|Looks nice but does not hold up to the summer heat.  The fabric started separating.
B00029X5WO|5|Have only used them once but they definitely wipe the windshield without any streaks. Time will tell if they last but will update any problems.
B00YZBAPDM|5|Changing it isn't too difficult. The best part is the product fixed my AC blower problems and continues to work great.
B00TM9BF18|5|Yes  love it
B0078U8WGY|4|Good product
B004SX5HJO|1|When I got the lights, I got everything it shows EXCEPT the grille set. VERY disappointed.
B0042LKNGY|3|Sounds how I expected. Doesnt fit too well. Had to do some adjustments.
B00N9HLC5S|5|New in box and excellent condition.
B001AMA9IK|5|all good
B00ADND7CW|4|Roof rack cross bars fit perfectly onto existing roof racks. Tightening the cross bars was difficult - had to use a short screwdriver to tighten them.
B007Q1B6UO|5|Exactly as described
B0004KSBCA|5|fits like a glove.
B000SL4AA2|5|works perfectly, comes with a bunch of little attachments you will probably only use if you bought this for recreation purposes (inflatable rafts, basketball, football, volleyball)
B004A6GX24|5|Works and fits perfectly on a 2006 Impala.  Fast delivery. Thanks.
B00BAZCIR2|3|I could not tell by the photos what the base looked like, so I ordered the wrong size. I found that I could use screws to hold the bulbs in my lights.
B000VKTUJQ|5|I have a 2010 Tacoma and this cabin filter fits and works perfectly. Definitely will by again.
B004R39PSY|5|Ramp Only.  Purchased with the cargo carrier for my snow blower.  Works great!
B00J65ILO2|5|This is a good solid antifreeze,  has all the additives that all vehicles need, not just heavy duty.
B0074EJ4QQ|5|Fits snugly on my 14.5&#34; steering wheel (2007 Ford Focus). There is no weird rubber smell and the cover feels great. Absolutely recommend.<br /><br />(Note that you do have to wrestle to get the cover onto the steering wheel, but there is no slippage once it is on.)
B003VWXVN2|5|Good buy... DIY installed & still works great. Had it for two mos now...
B003V57NUQ|5|I was looking for yak racks and ran across these.  Unlike other customer experiences, mine came with instructions and went together without a problem.  Incredible bang for your buck.  Total assembly time was about 30 minutes on the couch (while watching sharktopus vs teracuda I might add).  I was slightly skeptical going in to this, but with such a good experience with the first one, I am going ahead and ordering another pair for the second yak.
B00LCFOIVE|5|Out of the box and on the car in 5 minutes. Makes my old car look new, actually a little sportier than new!
B002TJTZ8I|5|My 5 year old got this as part of his safety gear pack when we got him a little 125cc 4 wheeler for Christmas. 7 months later and it has held up extremely well. He takes great pride in making sure his safety gear is worn properly and he has never complained about wearing it due to any discomfort or sizing problems. I highly recommend it. He doesn't get on his 4 wheeler without this, his helmet or other pads. He loves it muddy, but it washes up quick and easy with a garden hose. A great buy, as he has still has plenty of room to grow into this!!!
B005G21IQC|5|This was a perfect replacement. It took about 30 minutes to bolt in.
B005RNEYAM|5|Lays down smooth with little to no pinholes... Great price too I paid $70 at Napa auto parts because I was in a bind
B006N96KX8|3|Straight forward installation (with ball point press) but the grease fittings that are supplied are made cheap and leak as you pump grease into it. besides the fittings, the ball joint seem sound.
B0072UI10W|1|did not fit my car I triple check to make sure IT fit ,Amazon said it did  put the I had IT professionaly installed they said IT was the wrong hitch or its welded wrong
B00OH0S5Y2|2|Super bright, but they tend to fail after about 2 weeks. I've been through all 10 of these now. Each one starts off fine, but will end up blinking/flashing about 2 weeks in and has to be replaced.
B00ELASYIA|5|Great set of cables!
B000C3XDB8|5|Love the wrench-off performance filters from K&N. What do I really need to say about them? They're a little over-priced, but I think they're worth the cost.
B00LBFFLN4|5|Exactly as stated and look sharp
B005IXOKW8|5|just right
B008D88FAS|5|Inexpensive alternative to Thule and Yakima. It does the job great. I driven multiple bikes up there through town, on crappy country roads and on a long highway trip and have not had any issues or even any fear of losing the bikes.
B0007WXJDQ|5|Exactly as advertised, no problems installing, operates as it should!
B0009VD1L0|5|worked as expected to cover some front end damage, thanks!
B004ME11FS|1|Used 3 times and now it has a bad kink in it that I cannot get out.  I believe it caused a leak at the spigot at the campground because water would not flow properly.
B005N53C9I|5|Love these seats in my Tahoe!!! Had to cut a space for my seat belts because they are built in the side but I just put a simple hem in and they look perfect!!!
B00SNMUN0Y|5|It's awesome!! Delivered very quickly!!
B003ENG3M4|5|Just as described.  Very well packaged.  I am impressed.
B002MESVUI|4|Make's your car looks brand new, with these Headlights.
B000BZJDK2|5|Perfect fit and function, same OEM as OE part at much cheaper cost.
B00N5C28BO|5|Couldn’t ask for more from a gravity siphon.  Worked well.  Quality materials.  Should last a long time.  I was able to pull about 15 gallons out of my truck so I could change the fuel pump.  Only had about a ½ inch of gas left in the deepest part of the tank when I took it apart.
B000CO9DDE|5|Some minor fitment issues on driver side otherwise excelent product
B00EFVJ498|5|Great cover, looks good and protects my wife's Kawasaki Ninja 250 with a tall windshield. Fits that setup perfectly.
B0006V2BRS|5|Ok,on time good ,thanks!!
B00V5BTCYI|2|Did not clean as stated it would and left no sheen whatsoever, not even noticeable when rain hits the top
B00310M8ZQ|5|Perfect, brand new. No need for choke lever on 280s though.
B005JWCPUC|5|Good seat covers
B00BITLO7A|4|Works perfect after minor modification.  The left and right sides where they contact the door are molded straight, the door is curved.  I ground off the material to match the door curve, worked perfect after that.  Came with a gasket that was not used with the stock handle, I did not install it.
B00BE27N3U|1|Base is too big....does not fit 9.8 Tohatsu!
B00Q14R5SY|3|Does nothing special just works and looks good
B003D1QVJ2|5|OEM parts and a substantial savings from what my local dealer offered.
B00SU6NHI8|5|Awesome charger, fully charges my Fusion in about 2 hours
B002UCYRZU|5|Product worked better then expected and have recommended to other bike owners
B008S9CHW4|4|The helmet fits great (I guessed on the size), and I have had no issues with it this far other than the ventilation being somewhat poor even with the vents open. Still, I would recommend this helmet to anybody looking for a cheap DOT approved helmet.
B004C0MO6W|5|Fixed my A/C issues with my Honda. Had random A/C stop working at random times typically hotter days. Thought I had a system that needed recharged. Looked on youtube and found this caused the issue. Tested the system with a same relay used for a fan in the relay box. Fixed the problem, ordered this to replace the defective one, plugged in and nice ice cold A/C is restored!!!!
B00FA8XRIO|5|Nice and sturdy floormats, gives my feet solid footing while driving and keeps car clean; very easy to clean and dries quickly too.
B001GN1GLM|5|Excellent quality.
B00GG9FB8U|5|Great cleaning product for my car.
B000NK9CN8|5|Good filter. Fits perfectly. Pickup on my 2010 Rav4 seems to be better.
B000CI52OE|5|Good  price and great service.
B00K087KCI|4|Like the works the car and easy to put up
B00WYRL1VY|1|I do not recommend this helmet Bluetooth is horrible  callers can not hear me.i can only use it for music which is okay.got this because I really wanted a Bluetooth helmet and Skully helmet has not yet been released.also a rip off if you want it fast.
B00TUNSV2W|5|Amazing cleaner for my car.<br /><br />I have grease stains on my car that wouldn't come off in the past no matter how much I tried.  One shot of this chemical masterpiece and I was able to citrus away the grease and grime!!<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00KYW5GXU|2|Not the best quality, but fits well.
B001R5XSGU|5|Used to replace a blown out section of fuel line inside the tank of my motorcycle, ethanol has done it's damage to the OEM part. This should be alright however I've moved to using non-oxygenated fuel. A number of months into use I pulled the pump to check it's condition, everything looks good to go!
B004ZF3A94|5|The product came nicely packaged.<br /><br />One of the ballast was defective but the vendor replaced it immediately and everything is running great.
B0039OO532|5|perfect
B0052VVCAE|5|sweeeet
B00XLNFH10|5|Works perfectly in a 1993 Oldsmobile...I have numb fingers and I can't manipulate the clasp close to the seat.
B00F9LPJ8S|5|Works great. I had not started my motorcycle in a while. It cranked right over and is running great.
B00C5789IQ|4|NOT FOR MINI COOPER S 2008, despite what the compatibility states.
B000AP57U8|5|Used this K&N Filter to replace a stock Harley air filter on my FXSTC.<br /><br />It's an easy install.....took about 15 minutes.  I noticed an immediate improvement in performance.  My shift points went down a couple MPH.  I didn't so much notice a lower shift point in the lower gears, but when riding 2 up with my wife, I can now comfortably go from 5th gear to 6th gear at 61 or 62 MPH without lugging the engine.....it purrs along perfectly as long as you're not climbing steep hills or needing to accelerate quickly.  Before installing the K&N filter, I couldn't shift into 6th until at least 65 MPH.<br /><br />It's engine is definately peppier than it was before.<br /><br />I also checked the overall miles per gallon a number of times, and I'm up 2-3 MPG as well......so it's all good !  We took a longer ride last weekend and actually cracked 50 MPG.  Typically after installing the K&N we've been running 48-49 MPG.  Previously with the Harley air filters I was running at about 46 MPG.
B000CB0KHA|4|got exactly what I need!
B002XM5G70|4|Works great, delivered on time and as described. Thank You, Rick!
B0001L0DFA|1|I really, really don't like this nozzle. I don't understand all the good reviews. There is no control except continual rotation of the large head, left to right or back, and if you have small hands or arthritis (I have both), this is a bother. I have a lot of flower beds all over my patio and I find myself keeping the hose on across the stone to avoid turning it on and off over and over again. While I don't live in an area with water shortages, it is still wasteful. I bought two of these, one for the front and one for the back yard. I will be giving both to Goodwill.
B001GN6XSS|1|I asked Amazon what the diameter of the hook was, and they didn't know.  I went to CURT website, and found that the diameter is 9/16&#34;.  Will not fit my chains.  Glad I didn't  order then go through the hassle of returning.
B000GU0JHS|5|This has become such a valuable tool in my project to rebuild the motor of my 89 zx600c however when splitting the case the alternator rotor does need to be removed, unfortunately this was information I had to find else where.
B00DTEDKK6|5|works great. nice and clear. Also works with Goldwing motorcycle.
B00IDYDJZS|5|Thanks
B000HM5JP2|4|It works like a chamois should - keep it wet, wring out often and keep it clean!
B00EK7SZGU|2|three pcs with red color and the fourth one with different color
B0057VQUUG|4|Fine for what we needed - getting a 4-wheeler in and out of a shed.  They are pretty narrow so be sure to check the measurements.
B002P8IUUM|5|Enough said with this one...
B0009IBJE4|5|good
B004306VTC|3|i ordered 2 of these mats at the same time. both ordered were 6 x 9. when i received them one was 6 x 9 & the other was 6 x 8.8.  4&#34; short.<br />i decided to keep the shorter one because it's too much of a hassle to send it back. i use them in my indoor patio room where i can't put a regular carpet because of the concrete slab floor  i would have given this product 4 or 5 stars were it not for one being 4&#34; short.
B003ZWHUJY|5|Worked like a charm
B00NAN93DE|5|It looks phenomenal, easy to apply. Just have to see if it goes through the auto car wash.
B00EF1ERQI|5|great 5th wheel tailgate, light weight and strong and arrived in good condition and received very fast
B00BCRMAAS|1|I bought for a Subaru Forester 2015 and said it would fit on the Amazon website when I selected the item...BUT there is no way you can fit the back seats covers.  So you buy 17pc but you use 2...(...well the seat belt and head rest fit as well !!)...NOT a GOOD DEAL !
B00PZ5XHG4|4|Fit ok
B0057UEW6G|5|yes
B00UZBWHBE|1|Bought these for the Givi windscreen replacement for a 2006 Burgman 400.  This product is a very, very cheap version of the OEM well nut.   OEM and some other after-market brands have BOTH ends of the nut encased in the rubber unlike this product.   This omission allows the nut to easily push out of rubber grommet when inserting.  Also, these are too short (for my needs anyway).  The depth, or overall length (which is not in the description) is (1/2&#34;) a half inch; enough to push through the thick windscreen, but doesn't leave enough material for the nut to compress the rubber to create a good secure grip  I do not recommend.  Look elsewhere for reasons of poor quality.
B000C2UCMM|4|This hose does not have the same wall thickness as OEM but it was a perfect fit.
B0000C6F6L|5|Fits perfectly.  Replaced the old handle that was stripped out.
B005OT3K5E|4|It arrived exactly as said to and is what I was looking for.
B0090QLOM8|5|Great ramps.  Recommend to anyone that needs a 6 foot ramp.
B00I3RBDDK|5|Great product
B003YLIHT8|5|Nice item, fan speed improved!
B004P9ZP1Q|5|Excellent Heavy Duty Leaf Springs
B0000AVW57|5|very nice feeling
B0028PJ10K|4|spares.
B000VLF8HI|2|First off I love my Element doors. It seems however that everything Bestop makes that attaches to the doors is absolutely horrible. The handles are a great idea I would love to be able to lock these doors. The handles that came with the doors wore out quickly do to some rubbing of the door and my roll cage the cage is not factory so I will take the blame for the first set. I found this locking set and ordered it the night my driver side latch stopped closing. Got the latches installed and everything seemed good however when the element door soft uppers are in a slight amount of tension is put on the door and the latch apperantly the latch can't take it and they have both failed. I will be getting a replacement pair and hope the last two had been made on a Friday at the factory. I'll let you know how it turns out.
B007PL1EWA|2|It doesn't fit my 2010 Volkswagen GTI nor 2011 Jetta Sports Wagon. The 27&#34; measurement is misleading because the small dip where the mirror is supposed to go isn't cut low enough. This causes the whole thing to get pushed down lower and then the top can't be secured with the visors.
B00CJKZBCQ|4|Works good.  Very happy with product.
B001G7WW6Q|1|This is not the right wiper blade for a 1994 Previa
B00NGHLY4U|5|These work great
B004IV58AY|4|Basic product. Reads codes, VIN, and if car systems ready and clears the memory. Gave it 4 stars since that is all it does (as advertised). It's a good product just not excellent. Unit is light but is in cased  in a sturdy plastic with a thick wire. Will not tell you what the code is. Need to Google it. Car must be RUNNING not just with the ignition on for the reader to work. Used it on two cars (Mazda and a Dodge) and unit has already paid for itself.
B00UUJ2E6Y|5|Looks great and grips your back side real well
B0012TYXKG|1|Doesnt fit honda rebel bought for no reason
B001XVEM22|5|good price and on time no problems, Thanks.
B00312902S|4|Good quality construction with durable hinges and nice latches. the storage in the lid is very handy and one of the reasons I liked it to start with. The mounting hardware it comes with is good, but I couldn't use it in my application. The only negative I have is that it does not have seal around the lid to keep water and dust out. But I knew that before ordering it, and it is an easy fix with a roll of sponge tape.
B0082365AQ|5|Works great, need to leave outside a few days for the tires to gas off.
B00W6IZ79I|5|Allows me to let my windows down a little more to help heat escape. I really like them and they look great.
B001810SHA|1|I have a bad gauge issue that causes incorrect pressure reading and the gauge also doesn't stay tight. This buy is like a hit or miss so beware.
B007Y50BK8|1|We sent it back, it was too large to even put it in our window. We were refunded easily enough, but with the auto description, one would think it would have fit. It looked to be a decent quality and we would have loved it I am sure, IF it fit!
B007AG8YQY|5|Great
B009Z1QCFC|5|Worked like it was supposed to. Priced great!
B005BDCPH2|1|over $700 for this? rip off much? no thanks.
B00PWXFNTI|5|It's my second one, I love it.
B000IYPSLY|5|Perfect
B00COYNVKQ|5|Darth Vader floor mats! 'Nuff said!
B0002KNZL4|5|ok
B00XVE6VUK|1|Terrible! After installing this part on my &#34;2002 Mazda 626 2.0L&#34;, I started it up and began to cringe as my tach revved to 4000rpm and holding! It follows that the computer must resynchronize to the new IAC but it just isn't returning to idle. If I disconnect and reconnect the battery the IAC behaves as normal. The first time I turn off the ignition and start it back up the IAC takes it right back up to 4000rpm! Now I know why this part was so inexpensive, everywhere else I've looked its $150+. Im out 40 bucks but I've learned a valuable lesson. On to Plan B. I purchased an IAC today from the junk yard for 20 bucks, now my car is idling like new again. You could expect a junkyard IAC to perform this poorly, not a brand new one!
B00O83MEXG|5|Awesome...love the look it gave to my girlfriends truck...but what I loved was that she loved them as much as I did
B003CWPJKE|4|Love this cover, REALLY Seems to protect car, only wish it came with storage bag and since it is specifically made for MY MODEL of car I wish there was pre-cut hole with GROMMETS...for such an expensive item.  ALSO THE CABLE that was recommended with cover is not worth using, I will be making my own with heavier cable
B000JU1F1E|5|Bought for my dad...his old one finally bit the dust.
B005JMCVNS|5|Excellent mirrors! Super easy to install (if you need help watch Nossorama's video on YouTube). They really allow you to see so much more than stock mirrors. Highly recommended!
B004RC8TU0|5|Easily applies to the car!
B00FDNNZJM|5|Great way to display your gauges. Easy to install
B00EP3PV4S|5|Amazingly simple instructions and installation! Had it on my truck within 45 minutes of delivery, and the nerd bars look great. Good quality for the price.
B00GSJL7BS|4|good fit
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Awsome little lights. I mounted them on my tractor.  They are almost too bright
B00C42T7J2|3|Ok
B0070Y35OC|5|Way easier to install than tint from a roll. High quality that looks like it won't turn purple in a year. That precut idea works great and is definitely worth the cost over a standard roll of tint. Some people on here were confused on how to order for your specific car, just send them an email after you order. Great service, they took care of everything and at a great price. Quick shipping too. Great deal all around.
B003K5S4NW|5|Product received on time and as described.
B00GSAUHB8|5|I've been using mine for about a month on a tropical island and it's done a solid job of keeping the heat off the dash and cooling the car a few degrees.  It covers more area and stays in place much better than the accordion-style sunshade.  I think that the custom-fit ones probably do a better job at insulating, but they don't compact as well.  The bonus adhesive pad is super sticky, but I haven't found a good use for it yet.
B00COMENSM|5|Kive it
B00480N154|2|I order these head light bulb for my 2000 subaru outback...and it doesn't fit in..there is a little difference in diameters for the fitting on the base of the bulb..its a little to big so cannot use it...but lucky...my wife as an outback 2006 and it should fit...will see and check
B007PTMIYU|4|Good product, and easy to install, but it does make your truck ride slightly rougher.
B00F7NLPVI|5|They r stickers u peel the back off and stick them some where!!
B009YMG7PW|4|Good product,fits well, just kind of expensive.
B00A14H3TG|2|The Handle is way to small for the tool.  Cheap plastic handle.
B000C560CA|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '94 explorer Sport. No issues.
B00B7M60U4|5|work on my 2000 gmc sierra. great price.
B00FSG3DTG|3|no brighter than the cheaper ones. Actually I bought a few and they really vary.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great with torque and my toyota 4runner.
B00AIJY2ZM|5|well what can I say It works , i got it fast , not much else really to say .
B004GD1MLS|5|Perfect fit.  Works perfectly.  I am not sure what brand it is, as the seller proclaims it is &#34;various manufactures&#34; but it looks OEM, without any stamping.  The OEM brand is Denso.  Shipping was ridiculously fast and the part works well.
B009XRQ3T8|5|perfect replacement.
B00HVI96U4|5|Fits perfect over my Honda Pilot key chain. Existing key plast backing cracked. Did not want to pay a lot to replace key so bought this and it works perfectly.
B00HCSBQ7Y|5|good looking light, I have not installed them yet
B0060BJDKQ|3|As advertised. It was wrapped in two napkins with the name Pedro on it. Looked like it had been used before. Will not order from them again. Presentation is terrible.  Product is fine.
B00Y5FIL3Y|5|I can't wait for the ricers to see this and feel ill, because they are illin! Signed 500 H.P. V6 soon!!!
B00XVY1O48|1|It burns and melted the plastic area just above it. It cost me $130 to replace the plastic part.<br />Dangerous and would not recommend it!
B00HHGS5NE|4|Tough time removing old ones but these installed easily and seem to be working fine.
B00C7PX19I|4|Went on pretty easy. Pressed up into the channels after cleaning them with the included alcohol wipes . I had a little trouble with the rear windows, but a couple of adjustments and the window closed. Now just to let them set the full 24 hours recommended by the company. Update: I had to save the top rear and back rear of the front passenger shade to get it to stop banging the window. A little shave and some new 3m double sided tape and it's good to go.
B00BCRMB34|5|It turned out well it fits the car pretty good.
B009B42FB8|5|Installed in minutes! Very pleased!
B00CNA2BV6|5|Excellent Product.  Does what it says it will do and I am really pleased .
B001PL5S5U|4|The structure /quality of the leather was not 100% equal all over. So I can't give it 5 stars. But it gives the steering wheel a nice touch! It takes some time to mount and you have to be quit careful to get the right finish.
B0007OWD2M|5|Best glass cleaner made. Leaves glass clean without streaking. does not have a strong ammonia smell. Goes on foamy and comes off with little effort.
B00ZCKPH2O|5|Fantastic item from Lund.<br />Fit my 2015 Tundra Crewmax nicely. From opening the box to completion was less than an hour (not including the light wiring). Looks great, appears very durable, and the black textured finish is great. Well worth the money.
B00KTJ4RUG|3|The delivery was fine and I am sure it works, but I can't seem to program it right.
B00D9E3GTG|5|I liked the way it folds. But it's more suitable for soft surfaces such as lawns. Mine was protruded by thick grass grown in eastern Mongolia. I like the size and texture though. Meets my expectations.
B00PJPHEBO|3|Works like it should, though the app that came with it didn't (would read codes but not clear them). I found another free Android app that did work (Piston).
B00CIEIC42|5|Fits great works just as needed. Thank you
B000BN3UIK|5|Great fit and arrived quickly.  Just what I was hoping for.
B00S1993PK|2|They don't stick
B006JJS1KW|4|very bright.  i was dissapointed when i got them and they were flexible.  other than that they are great.
B009MR7F64|4|It is a nice cover.  It does not cover the whole bike with the side bags and top locker installed. I almost returned it but decided to keep it. I will just take them off for the winter.  A bit expensive but quality well enough.  It'll do the job.
B00Y5GHDPK|5|Work great and look professional
B001P5EMVW|1|I just received this item today and decided to bench test it first before installing.  The unit was defective.  The LED stay lit when just power +12V and Ground was hooked up!  It was supposed to be off until I connect the Ground When Armed wire to ground (Orange) or it was supposed to strobe if the Alarm wire is connected to +12V.  There is little to no information on the internet in regards to this.  I am not sure if Varad made a mistake in creating these?  Addendum August 12, 2015: Amazon sent me my replacement unit and finally, that unit works.  This LED does draw a fair amount of current, as it uses a super bright Cree LED.  13.8Vdc, this unit draws a peak of 0.25 Amps during each flash.  Luckily the LED does not stay on continuously.  This yields over 3Watts.  The LED itself is really small.  I did purchase a cheaper 12Vdc strobe.  Look for the Maxxima 1&#34; LED Auxiliary Micro Strobe Light.  This has a programmable flash pattern and draws much less current than this one.  Please be aware that Varad no longer produces these.  So whatever you see for sale on the internet (eBay an Amazon), those are the only units left on the market.
B0002F66H4|4|Great tire cover.  Wish it came in black to hide the dirt but it's still a great cover for my needs!
B007ACZTGQ|5|A+
B000C0WKGU|1|did not fit.  not described properly
B00144BIC0|1|Didn't come with revers light. I'd like to return it and receive theroght one.
B006N93158|3|Sound looking ball joint but very tight fit on the bushing side.  It didn't go in as smoothly as expected and needed some help going into place.  I wish the design was like the passenger side. It was much easier.
B0050SFZBG|5|as advertised
B006G0MK9W|4|Like OEM which are weak and tend to break.
B000778LCU|5|great product
B00MXGCBK6|3|Love the Quality but for the Dodge Ram truck 2004, the center console does not fit and they were very very hard to install.
B008427CZ2|5|good price
B00FR2JF0W|4|Works great
B00W8YYMUA|5|good price
B002M3KSK0|5|Worked and continues to work great.  Easy to hook up to my 2010 Odyssey.  Held my full cargo carrier over 1000 miles with no problems. Buy this one
B000TM7HXC|1|I'd love to write a more detailed review but it stopped working after just one day.
B0009Y2CFS|5|I have purchased these before for use on side by side. Great product
B00X2TUW1I|5|Product arrived timely and as described.
B00029XGAU|3|Works good but I wish it was louder.
B00077U326|3|This rear mat does not fit to the edge of the carpet like they usually do
B001XU25LI|5|Works as described. Had no problems removing tree sap, road grime, and bugs.
B004GEYHGY|3|Tail light works fine. Delivery took way to long. The reason people buy a tail light is because their other one is broken. If a cop sees that you get a ticket.
B00PE0JPFW|5|Outstanding quality
B005CWA9RU|5|Worked exactly what I needed it for, even replaced my cams! Follow directions if you are a DYIer like me. Research on the internet, there is mechanical fine skills involved in this so take your time.
B00PBON9VC|5|excellent fit and finish, a little more wind noise than expected, but absolutely a great helmet for the price.
B005BFM0AC|5|Works as expected.  Over 140,000 miles in our Honda before changing.  Old Coolant looked great.
B000QV2D4E|1|Look elsewhere (I just went and got an OEM part from the dealer).  These lasted 6 months until they split...very cheap rubber hoses.
B000630G32|5|Took it out of the box and on the car and is running well.
B00EB03YEE|5|perfect fit...arrived early...great buy...great seller
B00BUHU3EA|4|Fit and works well. Hint to those installing in 2007 Prius (or similar generation); loosen the inverter mounts and remove the driver's side headlight. Then use 2 vise grip pliers with leather over the teeth to clamp the two hoses on the existing unit. Then remove the unit, remove the hoses, attach the hoses to the new unit, remove the clamps, and screw in the pump. Took me 15 minutes to do this way and I avoided having to bleed the system. Good luck!
B00ARL70NM|4|Looks very sharp. It is a nice addition to the hitch.
B00MOYJ9DE|5|Nice color sequence!
B00N97WBMQ|5|awsome
B000R4EY4C|5|Exactly what I needed for doing a complete brake job on my 2003 Silverado V6 2D LWB Work Truck.<br />When I started doing the usual PM one does immediately upon purchasing a used vehicle, I realized either the PO lied about keeping up the maintenance, or his &#34;mechanic&#34; lied to him about doing it. Either way, I knew this brake kit would be a necessity when I was planning on doing a complete brake job on my recently purchased used truck. All the parts fit exactly as the OE.
B00K7938O4|5|Nice quality product at a cheap price, i recomend it to my friends and family.
B007Y04W9O|3|made very cheep material, Bulb conector holes are not sealing well ,Have to replace it  soon with something better quality.

B000E8T81U|5|Saved money buying these oil filters on line.
B003H18G8C|5|Great product, easy to wax your car or truck or boat or motorbike. The more times you use it the more gloss you add. Don't have to rub it in hard like paste wax.
B008S9QUGI|4|This is an excellent upgrade if your truck does not come with a locking tailgate. Simply install &#34;following the instructions&#34; insert your ignition key to your truck, turn it, the lock will now recognize your factory key
B00JP1A6O0|4|CUSTOMER HAPPY
B001NAP2D6|5|Easiest install yet on my Polaris 800 xp...oil filter is in a tight spot and the nut on the end makes it a breeze to replace!!!

B00E9HWRK6|3|should have got a darker color, they get dirty fast
B0010GN6I6|5|Great product, great price, happy.
B00LUZB9LI|3|The product looks and functions alright, however, the LED light went out within 48 hours of receiving this.
B00SLKZCWC|5|Fits my 350z. Replaced my OEM hose as it developed a leak. Fitment is perfect!
B008IYH3KU|5|very haooy
B003XFZRR0|5|Yes I like it did the job
B0041MGDLI|5|Replaced both front assembly's on my 2003 Pontiac Grand Am and the car drives like a brand new car now.  All previous noise I was experiencing is gone.  I have driven about 5000 miles since installing these and have had no problems at all.
B0024E6V30|5|These worked great for us. Cleared all the impurities out of the water and made the water not taste like iron anymore.
B002XLL8FK|5|I just received these on 8/5/15 and there were indeed 2 jacks in the box.  There is a single box, but their are 2 jacks.  I will install it tonight and update my review.
B004MSJ7C8|5|Excelente thanks!!!!
B00K2SLS7O|5|Worked out great for all the little things I had no place to put.
B00HRXNLIG|5|Perfect!!!!
B0017UBHQS|5|Good
B0002M9PCA|5|I have used these for years on horrors, always sound great. This time I'm using one for a resonator on my wifes Mitsubishi Endeavor. Sounds rich and throaty, no cackle or resonance. Great addition to the delta 40 flowmaster out back.
B007G2KJTW|4|Really are enjoying this rug
B005MVB2WM|5|Great wrench organizer.Cleary marked, Craftsman fits well.
B00MU5X17M|5|Perfect quality plus shipping .<br /><br />thanks a lot
B001A6CJJS|4|Overall this is a good, well priced helmet. I'll give it a 7 out of 10.<br />First, the helmet runs small. I usually take a Large and have several helmets in that size and all are comfortable. I originally ordered a Large and could not believe how snug it was. I didn't even take a ride with it but returned it and ordered an XL. That one fit well.<br />Second, the optical clearness of the face shield is incredible. With the face shield down, it doesn't even seem to be there. No distortion anywhere! The face shield is very easy to flip up at a spot light for ventilation. Very good points here.<br />Finally, and the reason it didn't score higher, is that the helmet lets in a LOT more air than you think it would at highway speed. The wind seems to come in around the sides and hit you on the side of the face. It doesn't come in your eyes, they seem out of the wind. I was very surprised given the design, how much air came in around the helmet at 65 - 70 mph. It wasn't enough to be unsafe, but definitely too much for touring, like 100 mlle rides or more. It seems to be more of an around town helmet. This is a bit puzzling as you'd think with the somewhat spherical design of the face shield, that nearly all the air would be off your face. The amount of wind the shield lets in, even when down and locked is the only reason it didn't score higher.<br />Overall it does seem to be a comfortable, well made and priced helmet. If you were an around-town scooter rider, it would probably be nearly perfect.
B00OFS0PRQ|5|Good prices compare to other auto part sites.  Be sure to put in fresh battery.<br />Good for detecting old brake fluid.  A service item usually neglect by most.  Flush your brake fluid at least every 3-4 years.
B008KZD7UM|1|Garbage, screen went out right away, had to return it.
B00080QHMM|5|Accurate and compact.  Boring styling but it fits in the glove box and puts the pencil styles to shame.
B008XDKQSW|4|Tight fit for my Targa - just the way it should be.
B001A0F88I|5|Received on time.  Easy to install.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Great price, fast delivery with Prime
B005SEK9IQ|5|Good price, fast shipping.  The only synthetic oil I will use in my trucks.
B002UC4TVC|5|Exactly as advertised. Works great!!!!!
B00M3L159Y|5|Worked perfect!
B003UT3S6Q|5|Great Stuff. Cleans the wheels with no brush.
B00EI23J4K|5|Works great easy to install
B004TXVOSG|5|Fast delivery & perfect
B002K5WXXU|5|Looks so cute and goes on easy sticks really great.
B00XKK74Y2|5|Good quality built harness but not for 9004/9007 connection
B000CPIQZ4|5|as adverttsed would buy again
B000GZTBDG|1|Lasted a little under 3 months in my k1100lt. Should've wasted money and time on this one.  A lot cheaper than the bmw gel cel, but not worth it.
B00KXE5VA2|5|A little expensive, but these are high quality and very reliable. I had no fear of failure using these to install glass into my Hot Rod project.
B00O9GVIOS|4|Fit ok!!!
B00DUFC974|5|Car cover exceeded our expectations. Easy to put on and off, fits great, completely waterproof in some severe Florida thunderstorms. We highly recommend for quality and price.
B00APRSI6G|1|s***
B0066STTKM|5|Cheap price fits just right
B000HBM3QQ|5|23 year Mercedes-Benz mechanic that loves this product. It is not a cure all and works best when used in the correct circumstances. I use this product about anytime a gasket is used whether coolant or oil. This, in my opinion, should not be used in place of a gasket or when you want to fill a large gap or need it to 'set up.' This is a sealer that works in conjunction with a gasket.
B0009OMYAQ|5|Worked perfectly on my 2013 Buick lacrosse ...saved a lot of time versus the way I was doing it!
B000P7O5DG|4|OK
B007MJCFIW|5|Very comfortable and great look.
B00WTCD70W|2|Didn't fit like stock
B007TY69TG|1|the motor was wired backwards so now the switch works in the opposite direction of all the others (master control as well), now I've got to take it back apart and switch the connectors around
B005EY2X16|5|Installed in 3 minutes without tools.  Fit 2014 Equinox LT perfectly.  Order arrived in 3 days in good condition.  Couldn't be happier.
B00ERXG4TM|5|Such a simple concept that works very well. Machined aluminum -- I like :-)
B00FFKRY4U|4|Beware.... though this fits the 2015 Escape, it doesn't stay :( I've had to &#34;modify&#34; to make it stay. Fingers crossed I've figured how to.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Everything you would expect from a battery charger...from charging dead cars to charging smart phones to laptops!  Holds a charge for a long time before it needs charging.  Nice and portable.
B007SKAKPU|1|gives u a code to go look up on the internet---once u look it up u find over 1000 things it could be! Go ahead buy it! see if what im telling u is the truth!!!
B000BRFUO8|5|I had a choice of blue or clear and took the clear as I thought that I would be able to see when the tank was empty but the clear shaft goes inside of the blue hose and all you see is the clear hooks. So it does not matter which color you buy as only the hooks are visible. easy to install into the hose end and works great. I also have a clear 45 degree elbow so that I can see when the tank runs clear. Great product.
B005CHFD62|5|A+
B008QR1ASK|5|Good quality product.
B000C5DUN2|5|Excellent as always
B0052XTSS0|4|Great item. I drove from Arizona to Florida no problems noted. It does make a slight whistling nose as other reviews state, but it's not bad. The item held my sears travel container firm in place the whole ride. Even had strong winds and thunderstorms.
B003FKTDLE|5|Being that other makers do not offer this size for the super crew, I was worried that they might not fit, or that they might have advertised the fit incorrectly, such was not the case.  While no fitting or trimming is required for a nice fit, a little trimming makes it fit like stock.  I would highly recommend these for anyone looking to get an extra couple of inches of tire coverage.
B00GIP6GRW|1|NOPE! Came from China. Had the white backing, not black as shown in picture. Also the J was significantly shorter that the factory J, a 1/4 inch shorter. It looked more like a U than a J! So, obviously I'm not going to put this crap on my Jeep! I will be contacting Amazon about returning this junk!
B000143LHY|5|eliminates odors at the source.
B001CF3QGC|3|I purchased these knowing full well that they were not designed for my specific seats. However, I was 99% certain that I could use them with minimal issue. I was right.<br />However, the covers that were sent to me appeared to have been previously returned: the color-printed retail box was crushed (seat covers aren't prone to breakage, so no biggie) and appeared to have gotten wet at some point (shipped in the retail box; no outer box). When I opened the box, one seat cover appeared to have just been wadded up and stuffed in there. Upon closer inspection, this cover had a four-inch tear inside one of the pockets (probably why it had been returned). There was also no instructions provided, and the included hardware was not all self-explanatory.<br />If my life were not so hectic, I probably would have went through the hassle of returning them.<br />They have not acquired any additional tears in thousands of miles, but the driver's cover is fading badly where my carcass rubs on it as I drive. Maybe I will toss it in some black dye.<br />If you get new ones, I think they are worth the money. Someone else's damaged return? Well, that's YOUR judgement call.
B000NCV1KS|5|Fit perfectly. Keeps temp down and blocks all sun. Set up and take down easy. Rolls up great. Love it
B00JGJH8QU|5|For the price best circuit analyzer you can buy. Works great.
B00JN0U4SQ|1|I can't get any radio reception even in town. Looks good but functions terrible
B00NB2TO38|5|Great product
B0009IK50S|3|My mistake I bought the wrong replacement. Next time I think it will be easier to buy a complete blade
B00AC5COYI|5|Bought with Powerbomb header and installed both. Gave awesome sound to the bike, now the CRF250L really sounds like a thumper! Nice clean deep sound. Very easy to install. Also lightens up the bike quite a bit, the stock muffler was heavy!
B0066TN0TM|5|Part worked perfectly. Exactly the same  colour as the original when light at night too.
B002OARCYQ|5|My wife loves the floorboards.  Little hard to get on but woks great.
B001UE0LLI|5|Very satisfied
B0122LV652|2|Parts were broken and missing key fitting pieces upon delivery. Not satisfied at all
B003B44C6U|5|Haven't used it yet, but it looks like it will be exactly what I need. It's a good size and definitely really durable!
B000TYOS3C|5|I really thought this item would be hard to find, and expensive. I was wrong on both accounts. Fits perfectly, looks just like the original.
B0058VF7KO|2|No directions.  No idea how to hook up halo portion without directions.
B001O0TZ7E|5|Works great!  Fit my 2003 Subaru Legacy
B0023VOV8Q|1|Disappointed it already has condensation so there had to have been a crack in it.
B003U91P3O|5|Pros:<br />-Decent quality, plastic looks and feels the same as the original mirror.<br />-Mirror glass is clear and even despite the other reviews.<br />-Cheap.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-None really.
B00OA66IG0|5|Works great, much easier washing my new f-150 than i could have imagined, works great with new 2000 psi 1.4 gpm electric pw. I've filled the container with about 3 oz of concentrated soap; the rest water and washed my truck 5 times and still have some left in first container. At this rate the gallon should last the life of the truck. I rigged up all hose connections with brass quick disconnects and I purchased a water filtration system that I hook into the water stream only for final rinse, this works great also. Get some good quality drying towels and good micro fiber towels for final drying and truck will look new after every wash. Love it!!!
B00QHZV7IQ|3|Works as advertised, but feels cheap like won't last long, and about 20% of time has signal lag.  Almost backed my truck into the hitch once because of video delay.  I was able to mount it on back of trailer after hookup, so in that sense it's better than usual built-in camera.
B0009IR0A6|5|works just fine
B00G7VTO1C|5|Now, people don't like it. It's the state flag! When I travel people ask me about it! It's not bad. It was made bad by one person. I'm proud to have it on my van. You want someone to blame it on? This country and the one who run it into the ground!!!
B0006JLU22|5|Just returned from a 1000 mile round trip family RV vacation. Drove through an Armageddon like storm with 40 mph crosswinds and driving rain.(for about 75 miles)They not only stayed attached to the camper but also kept out all the rain. The vents were open the entire time. Easy to install (watch the YouTube video first and it makes more sense) Make sure you take all supplies and tools up with you the first time. I love them!
B001C9VL9C|5|Fits perfectly, extremely easy to install - won't be ripped off by the dealer again for such a simple maintenance item.
B00RPOS600|5|Nice product.
B00ZBMKPAW|3|Not brite enough and one of the 2 was defective....will not buy again
B00BQMJV4M|5|Great product worked wonderful
B000BZ6Z4Y|5|perfec
B0080HJL7S|5|I’ve owned various garbage bags in the past and I am pleased to see that this bag is really well made. The bag keeps shape and is very easy to use.  I really like how there is a velcro tab I can just reach back while driving and pull the tab to open the lid, drop a piece of garbage in and close the lid back up within seconds and without taking my eyes off the road. I also tested out the water proofing which is quite appealing to me because I have children that sit in the back and sometimes they might throw some unfinished pop cans or juice boxes into the garbage bag and those can easily leak.  The material used in the liner in this bag seems to hold water no problem which is really nice.  Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase so far. - item received as part of promo for review
B000C2WDIS|4|This hose has a thinner wall thickness than OEM but was a perfect fit.
B00LE4P5E2|3|It says no drilling required to install, there is no possible way to install this without drilling! Every piece requires no less then 4 screws or bolts to be used. It's not an issue since I am fine installing it and have the tools to do so, but be warned, if you don't, you will need tools to do this.
B00G2T6O30|5|Excellent Case with clean, sleek, lean design and non obtrusive to the eye
B00BLQDTZU|2|It a comfortable helmet but the visor for the inner sun visor. The leaver to move it up and down broke.<br />only had it for 2 month.
B000E2AR70|5|Excellent product i should have ordered a few more fast shipping too
B000EDQR8M|3|On the high setting it still does not keep my 24 foot camper warm in the back of it where my bed is. There is no partition so nothing to prevent the heat from circulating. Since it is low profile, I would buy it again as I have a warm sleeping bag, because it is mounted on the back of the table in front of the door.
B004A130X4|5|It went on without any problems and less than 15 min it's make the truck look great thank you
B004J0UDTK|4|Perfect Radiator fan to corolla, it's too early to judge it but i trust that it will be a very high quality radiator fan
B000CSD2QY|5|works great..
B007HFX5NK|5|Looks great! Awesome fit (after a small width adjustment of the flange). Better than the original vent in many ways. A few more dollars than the basic vent - but well worth the investment.
B000VJJVIW|4|I was tired of nearly getting killed on my Honda Metropolitan because its stock exhaust is ridiculously quiet.  I wanted to try something a little louder to draw some attention to the drivers next to me and i think this will definitely do the trick.  This exhaust system is WAAAAAY louder then the metro/ruckus stock exhaust but still tolerable.  I will probably have to rejet and adjust my weights a bit with the new install as I lost a decent amount of the initial pep/acceleration, but gained a bit more top end (previous max was 40mph, hit 42mph on a straight-away with the dr.d exhaust).  I installed this exhaust in about 20 minutes using small electric impact wrench for the bolts. A breaker bar wouldn't hurt if you don't have an impact if your exhaust is rusty/old. The kit also includes some rudimentary directions/pictures which were helpful.
B005O01OMY|4|little small from the original
B004HM0QBK|1|Bad product will not fit 134-r
B00QU7LWFE|4|Gives my 2004 F150 the look I was going for. The turn signal socket did not fit so I just use my original, thus only 4 stars. I also silicone around the housing to prevent leaking in the future...just as a precaution.
B00TMISI3M|1|not recommended. terrible smell
B00GPRSZ54|5|It makes my car GROOVY
B001NVINVS|5|Beautiful patches.  I clearly didn't read it correctly because I ordered two, thinking that the price was for just one.  No biggie, i got 4 for the price I was willing to pay for 2 :)<br /><br />From what I can tell they look to be very high quality, good construction and identical (which helps when using them together or in the same area).<br /><br />Good packaging!  Would highly recommend!
B00G0OM2BK|5|Fit great easy install. Hopefully last. Remember. To fully dismount n mount it correctly to prevent cracking/ braking it. Especially when changing air filter. Completely take off intake before trying g to take off air filter cover. Trust me.
B00BFE3H6O|5|Like most people who have bought a used Xterra or Frontier the cup holders were in fact missing. After searching extensively for a set, I found these that are better priced and fit perfectly. Save yourself the time and just get a set of these here.  I'm glad I found these!
B006AFAWYI|5|Love, love, love this system for washing my RV. It takes considerably less time than doing it with a garden hose. There are water restrictions in California were I live due the the drought, so this is ideal. Most campgrounds nationwide prohibit the washing of vehicles so this is a life saver. Yes, it is expensive, but worth every penny if you cherish your ride like I do!
B00KY0A2MC|5|what a great price. this beat out everybody. the car has never been better!
B0077S1BBU|5|Cheap and works well so far. I'm not sure if it really is an OEM item, but it works.
B001HLYL06|5|I bought this for my 2010 Dodge Avenger 2.4. It says it doesn't fit but it definitely does. Noticeable improvement in the throttle and it has a gutsy rumble to it, not a pissed off bumblebee sound like most 4 cylinders. Install was also very easy minus having to put it on a lift
B00N2PLPRM|3|Everything about these is great except the fact that the bolt used to mount them is extremely fragile. I have now gone through two of these because the bolt has snapped once while tightening the nut, and once from what I'm assuming was just the vibration of my bike.
B0001CLCD6|5|This part fit good so far so good.
B007J7E4XG|5|Go Bucks!
B00T6HQFLQ|5|OK, to be clear I am usually weary of miracle in a bottle additives, especially with automotive fluids...BUT (you knew that was coming), this really does work. I use it in my 6.0 powerstroke with Rotella synthetic oil and the truck runs so much better than it did before. I didnt really know what stiction sounded and felt like really until it disappeared. I was getting used to it. This is worth every penny.
B000K3EM06|4|Works great but doesn't last long
B00P6OOAC4|4|Install a little challenging because of bolts/nuts not quite OEM specs.<br />For an old car they work just fine.
B00B0TN1PG|5|FYI, sizing from the Bell website:  XS 54-55 cm  / S 55-56 cm / M 57-58 cm / L 58-59 cm / XL 60-61 cm / XXL 62-63 cm.  CM = head circumference in centimeters.  Hope that helps.
B00T6JF52Y|5|These look great on my street glide! Ive been stopped by a lot of people asking where I got them.
B0006MRRU8|5|as advertised
B004WEZMBW|1|Like everyone else... The Brass screw that mates the tripod to the base that the panels attach to will not thread together.The Brass screw that mates the tripod to the base that the panels attach to will not thread together.  Sad I wasted my time with this item... Amazon needs to pull until goal zero fixes the issue!!
B001RKH7FS|3|This didn't work as well as I thought it would.  Ended up returning it.
B00K30NBOY|4|Well crafted and solid, reliable mechanism.
B0006H938M|5|Easy install and the height difference was perfect from the stand one.  I also like the handle better in the front than the lever in the back.  Makes it easier traveling with kids.
B000ET9SAU|5|Great experience. Fast shipping.
B00BYH6C1E|5|I've been using this product for a month now and it's wonderful. It was easy to install (just needed a bit of elbow grease) and does it's job. I'm still able to move both seats back and forth, at first there was a squeak, but it's gone away now. The manufactures also went above and beyond by including a few nifty and very useful extras!
B00ZE3WK4M|4|great kit great price
B000HT4KRI|3|no problems with them
B006B1Y2O2|5|Great!
B00BMEU9WW|5|great deal and worked perfect thanks!!!
B00SKV20KO|5|They are in my dodge charger now and all the haters hate my mats and stickers.
B00P2VWCQ2|1|Didn't work
B00KTIU7FG|1|My key barely fit in it. I would recommend this product if you are very good with your hands, very good using small tools and a file. If your precision isn't perfect it's easy to bend the parts that come with it and install it wrong, since the metal connector for the battery doesn't come pre installed, mine got a tiny bit bent on installation and as a result my key didn't fit and it didn't work. Then the case fit way too tightly, and unlike my stock key which opens up with ease, I had trouble opening it with a file again.<br /><br /> It would have helped if there were installation instructions. NOT USER FRIENDLY.
B001G8AIMU|5|Just what we needed
B002YIACG8|5|Works great
B00NIJUUCS|5|best stuff ever
B000PA03AC|5|worked great and easy install!
B00D7HZ6FC|5|I have only had it for three months and it has already recovered more than it cost. I have ordered another unit.<br />I have 7 wet batteries three of which were at the brink as checked by resting voltage and specific gravity.<br />All three have responded within three weeks each, like magic!
B00KTIY4ZA|5|This makes unlocking your car easy and its convenient yahoo use.
B000AP1MUW|5|Performs as wonderfully!
B003SOKEXI|4|Work just has it was suppose.
B000KYYMKK|5|WORKS GREAT AND WAS EASY TO PROGRAM!!
B007MI5SDW|4|Nice complement to the Raider front box.  Looks good on my 4 wheeler.  Smaller than expected but not terribly so.
B002INP6QU|1|This product broke right underneath my car almost crushing me, I do not recommend this product at all, if there were away to get my money back, I would, it almost cost me my life.
B000DCNF16|5|Filter Drier worked great on my 1994 Toyota Landcruiser, 4.5L Gas. Works great.
B008TW15O6|5|Starting a collection of skull items for the vehicle I'm trying to get.
B000BRQ0TW|4|Somewhat weak. Only 900psi. But great thing is under water works j-b weld. And nsf certification makes me reassure. First, leakage of water is not completely solved. But when I reapply it, solved.
B00KSEUX6Y|3|The item is exactly like the one from the dealership; my only problem is I have not had time to sit down and go through the steps to program it; I am hesitant since I don't want to be unable to get into the car without setting off the alarm.
B007Z8VG30|5|Sticker is great quality
B006JRL8W2|5|What a great tool when washing my 1/2 ton supercrew pickup.
B000E28C7M|5|It's K&N so the quality is there. I absolutely love the ability to take this off with a common wrench. So much easier and faster than using a filter wrench.
B007WURPQ8|5|It's a great warm weather jacket and the picture doesn't do it justice.  It fits perfectly and is well made.  Very pleased.
B008FHX0DE|5|Does what it is supposed to.
B0085IJXI4|5|Excellent service.  Wiring was perfect.
B00C4UIK6A|1|Very expensive tool and very poor. The Auteltech never answer any emails about this tool. The tool have the promise of updates, but Auteltech never updated this tool. I am very much disapointed with this tool. Don't buy Auteltech products!
B00JIJ4LWW|5|Was great.. Used for my purses and my leather chairs. Went on easy.

B000C55T7W|5|these are a perfect fit but they are painted BLACK not white<br />Same as the ones the ones i took off but  only lased  about 4 years
B009YY4NEC|5|PERFECT FOR MY BAR
B00065ZIJ2|5|is very easy to put on. I have this on my 1993 Jeep Wrangler when the top is off and it works like a charm. The key is shaped in such a way that makes it impossible to copy.
B0016IVB1W|5|Great price on an OE mount.
B00FRHOJYE|1|Both wipers are defective, sleeve sliding off both and not thoroughly removing water. I think I was sent broken ones by accident?
B00YXYWUC0|5|Nice thanks.
B005PD5L6K|5|Ok,on time good thanks!!
B0066QWL7W|5|Perfect without &#34;stealership&#34; price!!

B009DJTKYQ|4|Factory  FORD Emblem from old grille did not fit , had to engineer a  spacer between grille and emblem. Looks GOOD!
B00MPULBGK|3|Very nice finish but not what I was looking for. Slanted or italic style of numbers and letters the picture shows is not what you get. Looks just like oem face
B0009N0W60|5|Very nice addition!
B00QR67P1S|5|Installed sensor and it works great.
B004ZF39T0|5|Great product! Really easy to install, took me about an hour or less. I love how bright the 6000k are!

B001NYB4X4|5|Good  price and great service.
B000NVW1LM|5|Absolutely Positively Works!
B00ADH6FHW|5|Looks great and it goes good with my personalized license plate!!!
B009F7UE7I|5|Cannot speak to longevity but size is SPECTACULAR for the price.  I am able to fit my gear (I am a woman so not as large as man) and my 6 year old's gear in this bag...I'm talking 2 pair of pants, 2 pair of boots, 2 helmets, 2 goggles, 2 gloves, 1 chest protector (his) and some elbow pads~!
B0009F9UZM|5|👍
B00CMC5DII|5|Best tool for tapping into a vehicle harness without any wire stripping. Highly recommended. The high cost is easily justified the first time you use one of them in a congested vehicle harness.
B001QXRPUI|5|Absolutely loved it.  Brought some sheen back to my leather lounge.  Used in my car too.
B000C7UMAE|5|fitted to my 4.0 Wrangler TJ and works a treat. Took a couple of days for the PCM to learn it but now idles perfectly.
B002VE3VHW|5|This cover is good -so far- I have bought 4 car covers from &#34;BUDGE&#34; And they all have been junk.
B00COXVNNO|3|If you're looking for a basic Bluetooth OBD II scanner that works with your Android phone/tablet, you can give it a try. It's compatible with Torque, ScanMaster and most Android OBD II Apps. However, I returned this item because of the following reasons:<br /><br />1. Does not read ECU on one of my cars (2000 Nissan Sentra GXE)<br />2. Does not compatible with FORScan software on Windows OS (which was my main purpose of purchase this scanner)<br /><br />There are a lot of discussions on these ELM 327 clones. Basically most of those clones that claimed version v2.1 would not work on FORScan software. If you need a Bluetooth OBD II scanner for FORScan, keep looking. I will update if I find something that works on both Android and FORScan software.
B000C19DGY|5|Great Product
B007PK17BO|5|Fit perfectly in my 2015 cx5. Love them.
B0015YBX7Y|5|Works well, as advertized.
B00GKRQ7DG|5|Came out perfect. I love it! And the fact that there is no clear square around it makes it so much better
B007GPGMKE|1|Peeled off 2 weeks after I put it on. I degraded area well before placing. It curled up immediately.<br />Save your money
B008FCE6DW|5|The parts fit perfectly and assembly was simple (once I realized that the tool provided was dual purpose).
B00L2PJA9E|4|Very nice running boards, look great on the jeep. Had them installed by someone else so not sure how hard they were to put on.
B00PEEK3BS|3|A bitch to get on window.  Going very slow didn't help an messed up
B003UTQCOQ|1|Total junk, been on my truck for 5 weeks and already making a horrible noise. This is why my mechanic tells me to buy AC Delco. Don't waste your money...
B008H0QAB8|5|The cover is pretty thin and does what it's supposed to do, but we are getting some heat damage here in Texas.  I put some airfoil insulation in the skylights to try and help out - will see if it works.  Our fiver is a tad over 38' king pin to bumper and this has plenty of room. I really think I could use the smaller one. Classic Accessories themselves are great!  I found a rip on one of the corners even with using swimming pool noodle pieces to cover the drains.  I took a picture and submitted a claim online.  7 days later, I have a new cover sitting on my porch - no questions asked.  That's service.
B00GDHTR3K|5|@.@
B0000AXWSI|5|Excellent quality.  Much better than a competitive brand I had recently bought in an emergency.
B0006H938M|5|The toilet was exactly what we ordered it fitness space thank you very much we received our $25 rebate appreciated
B00RCEJQV6|5|Vería goog
B00PXZ919I|5|This is a quality DA polisher.  Comes with enough supplies to get your feet wet.  Huge fan of Chemical Guys and their customer service.  I really like the soft start feature so you can slowly spread out product before going to work on it
B00BTMQMSC|3|These lights aren't as bright as other brands.
B003VBJZP6|5|Good product. delivered on time
B00UM6B9MK|5|Love helmet! Runs a little big
B000BUTD8Y|5|i love it
B00N8ACHTG|4|They look great. They where hard to put on.
B00WRV96G4|5|yes honda
B00IN4IUZW|5|Look great I'm sure I'll have to paint the separate top piece eventually but look great the way they are
B0018PW15I|1|Attempted to fix a leak between the automatic transmission and transfer case.  THe can said it may take up to 5 coats to seal a leak.  I used over 10 and it still did not seal the leak.  If fact the leak did not change at all.
B00SM2EAMC|5|Perfect fit. Very satisfied
B007Q1DQHK|5|the best
B0056PIEM0|5|Great quality vinyl decals, clean cut and hollow (without a background) Just be careful when you apply it, make sure you don't reap it off when trying to remove the paper the holds the sticker in place because the glue is a bit to strong.
B00LD7K8VU|1|If you don't mind a decal that says &#34;BLABK FLAG&#34; you'll love it!
B000AA4RWM|5|nice...easy to use
B00F6D4UKW|2|cant see out the window when they are wet. took it off.
B008H3YM74|1|Not as advertised. It's a standard 120v/250v switch - not a lighted 12v switch.  Too much effort to return it.  I'll find somewhere I can use it.
B007PLZGO2|1|Received a completely different decal.
B00NKMX27S|5|Perfect during cerakoting for the pistol barrel.
B00757KJTI|4|Great replacement antenna for my 2008 Tundra.  Quite pricey but that's what happens when parts are made to fit a specific purpose!
B0007RDVFW|4|I haven't experimented with too many tire shines.  The consistency kind of reminds me of hair conditioner (I've often wondered if that's really what it is). This one gives a coat that looks rather nice and is not super intense. I had no problems with it streaking off the tire onto the car since it's pretty much absorbed into the tire once it dries. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because it does not last very long. You can get a week or two out of it if there is no rain. Once you drive through any water, this is gone and the dullness is back.
B0009H51RQ|5|Filter does exactly what you'd expect it to do.  It fits right, my truck runs and I'm back on the road. Fram always has this sort of thing down.
B00REJXVEW|5|Was as described,feels and looks good,seems to be good quality.would buy again.
B001NYN8S8|5|.Works like a champ still
B00E6ABZAY|5|nice
B0058J4QS0|4|Shipped Fast. Packed Well. Install was simple on my 2001 F150 Stepside  maybe 15 minutes. Not a &#34;smoked&#34; as they look in the pictures but look better than the factory red ones. one of mine has a &#34;rub&#34; on the lens. not awful but in a noticeable spot. Also be aware that you will be using ur existing reverse light bulbs and u can see them clearly when parked. i would suggest picking up a new set to install because your originals are probably crusty like mine were.
B008CE0R5E|5|Wonderful wheel stop!  My garden hose reel cart did not have a wheel lock so I bought this wheel stop.  It works so perfectly.  Thank you
B00G620ZVU|4|Very heavy duty and bright they never put instructions in the box though.
B00A9ZA1GO|3|looks good and functions ok.  but the leather wrap started coming off when it got hot and wind hitting it while riding.
B00JBHY0PO|5|I like them
B00AM1Z67O|5|I love it
B000FP0A46|4|I have used Faria gauges in the past and think they are the best on the market for their precision and price based upon 15 years experience usung them.  They are built in the USA and I think they have a lifetime warranty where you pay the shipping.  This tach works flawlessly w/o jumping or oscillating all over the scale.  The needle moves smoothly across the dial. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the instructions for setting the tach/engine selector switch are wrong for my engine.  There are 6 switch positions to select from to match your outboard engine to the tach.  Their recommendation for my engine was wrong.  It was based upon a range of engines built over a period of years.  After trial and error I finally selected position 6 which was not on their engine range list. It works perfectly.  Note:  It was not easy curling up into a ball on my side and reaching over my shoulder with my head turned under the dash to reach the switch the the 4 times I changed the setting.
B00W9OQNX8|5|Bright' Lights up the whole trail.
B009P38AGE|5|Just as listed works on my trailer.
B001BS4OX4|5|Great price, delivered on time in good condition, perfect fit and works exactly right in the vehicle.  Can't ask for more than that.
B00W4B8O6U|5|Fit perfectly and are comfortable
B00AMLNKMW|4|Bought this light and hoped it would be brighter than my other but it's not. But still a bright light and I didn't have a problem with the suction cups
B0093E8SRG|5|Seems to be of equal or better quality than the O/E  piece that broke and shape is an exact match..
B000COD57O|5|Installed these in a double DIN for my sxs. They all work great, but do get a little warm after a few hours of continuous use.
B00BITHR9Y|5|quick shipping item looks well made , need to see how long it will last , but it looks identical as factory , felt strong also .
B007HQ6E6E|5|Working great. The local John Deere parts place wanted $350.00 for a &#34;John Deere&#34; branded unit. This fit perfectly and works great. saved a ton of money
B0022UPHHM|4|Wish the valve stem head would rotate separately from the cable.
B00D8KJ8AM|5|Perfect fit for 2012 BMW Convertible
B00OBVWF5M|5|Just OUTSTANDING!
B00PV5DQV4|5|These fit my car great and look sporty.
B00IO985MY|1|I only had them on for 2 weeks and there already squealing
B0080E5800|5|Fit perfectly in my 2005 Volvo S40 without turbo. Don't know if the turbo model has the same fit.
B00V337VNM|4|Pretty decent looking, definitely worth the price.
B0002Q7HZ8|4|Nice quality v-belt for a good price.  I used it to replace my John Deere LX176 mower transmission drive belt.  JD OEM belt are way over priced.
B003WZRLZ2|5|The tool worked great and shipping was amazing!  Thank you!
B0009IQZH0|2|Totally overrated and overprices.  Just use any old towels
B007IQFJ5U|1|Stupid thing. Waited a long time for it to get here. Inserted nine-volt battery. Followed instructions, but the only thing this is good for is issuing a small &#34;chirp&#34; when any of the buttons are pressed. Press and hold  &#34;A&#34; to reset? Get a little &#34;chirp&#34; immediately (but not in 3 seconds). Press &#34;B&#34; to arm device? Get a little chirp. Shake device? NOTHING. This should just be called a chirping toy. Worthless.
B0068MV15C|5|Exactly as described.
B000CALMPK|5|Works just fine. It's not a hot rod carburetor, but it works well for my International Loadstar 1600 with the 345 CID engine.
B00SBUYYG2|1|I have received the package. It was not the correct item. Plus the item was in a poor quality.
B00ABQJMVG|5|These are so cute. Comes with 2. One for each mirror. Love it!
B001KSAB5A|4|these are great as a temporary solution if you cant afford to replace both mirrors :)
B000CQPR6Y|3|Too big for a Dodge Grand Caravan 2003
B00A6AS2WC|5|Exceptional tool and with the slim line design I am able to work in some tight spaces doing brake rotor measurements without removing the actual wheel/rim...
B006QBOKIK|4|not smoke, but just like the picture
B00GQ4DTGQ|5|well what can I say It works , i got it fast , not much else really to say .
B00A1A6PT4|5|Much more durable than the crappy plastic ones that were on the engine.
B000IYLETE|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '94 Explorer Sport. No issues.
B007GQ4MS2|5|very good
B00CEKWIQI|4|Arrived on time,a little hesitant with only 2in but they lowered my ej2 a solid 2 1/2 in.not bouncy(i installed new struts and all new bushings and tophats )smooth ride. Nice aggressive look with the performence I expected.  :)
B00F2NHVX4|5|These are great at keeping the dirt from circulating back into your car wash bucket.
B00KMZI2JE|5|Does a good job at what it is designed for.
B000OI4BLW|3|Poor chrome job would have returned but already had two of them on, would not buy again
B000Z0HVHA|5|Was more than i needed which was great
B00J6ZI566|5|Easy installation and looks great on vehicle, nice appearance...not a big, clunky hunk of metal hanging from bottom of car.
B00HWIZZTY|5|Solid piece, nicely finished.
B00RSOLXFM|5|I luv it.
B0067F0Y94|5|love this rummy for me and those quick runs to the store for small things
B00KFXRRUS|5|Exactly what I needed!
B00JIV2FLO|5|Great shield. Perfect fit. No problems
B0030DIURE|5|Easy install. perfect fit
B00KJGPN2K|5|Best investment you can make if you ride longer than 1 hour. Great range,features,sound even with face-shield wide open at 80mph. I have tried it at 4 different long trips over 8hours of ridding music and communication. Best feature hands down is the fact that you can be talking to someone and at the same time with out having to do anything extra you can hear your music in the background.
B00KN0UOEE|5|I started using this first on a 1985 Porsche spoiler. It was gray and the sun was taking its toll. Applied the 303 as directed. Now the spoiler is a black matte looking like new. It really does the job.
B002KJS2MM|5|Perfect fit
B00261FNB2|5|Perfect for adding that extra bit of room for installing CB antenna and Hi-Lift jack behind the tire.
B0057CXXAU|5|;)
B000CF6RZU|4|fit well, easy to install.
B000CO7QLK|5|Excellent product.
B00RK7FNJO|5|Awesome quality.  Love that the stitching matches my interior
B000C91F08|5|Quick ship and perfect fit. Thanks
B005VPS358|5|2000 XJ great upgrade<br />great ride, also replaced coils springs, shocks, tires, and upgraded to H4 headlights with relays<br />see full review and photos under Moog CC782 coil springs
B000B6CW6I|5|Works great.
B0027I88VQ|5|Great
B001AJH1HK|4|We like how these mirrors are easy to install and we don't have to keep the extended mirrors on when we aren't towing.It gives much better visiblity behind us as we are towing our travel trailer behind our '04 Suburban.  I knocked one star off because it did hinder being able to adjust the drivers side regular side mirror, which was aggravating when we had the trailer parked and were just driving around.  I don't know if this would be a problem for others or not.
B000E4U0OI|5|This handle was a perfect fit.  Will order more if I should need some more handles.
B002YLGBEW|4|it was a decal style sticker, not just peel and stick but overall, it met my expectations because more importantly it meant a lot to the person that it was for. and that's what matters the most
B00AYIJL3A|4|No complaints beautiful piece of vinyl has been on my check now for a little over a year
B00979N8L8|4|These gloves keep my hands really warm but the fingers seem to be a little short for my hands. I would suggest getting one size bigger. Other than that, very happy with the product!
B00S8K9T4W|5|Love it!!
B001CSMBNS|5|Very nice and good quality
B00K5CAZB2|5|good quality
B002HXXNUW|1|Too large/ receive damaged must return I wanted it as I went on vacation. I was disappointed Will return it after I get back after Aug. 7, 2015.
B0081SANYG|5|Good quality  nice copper terminals
B007KQ8LY4|1|Scent only seemed to last for about two weeks
B00HJ748M8|5|Was a perfect replacement for my camper.  I was worried the fit would not be the same, but it fit just like the original.  Would recommend for anyone needing to replace one.
B004BWU8H8|4|Easy to install on my new 2015 Wrangler unlimited. Sees very secure, use it to keep my CCW and garage door opener safe when im out of the Jeep due to the soft top. My only issue is that when I was tightening the seat bolts back down, the right side bracket did not sit completely flush due to a weld being directly under it on the seat bracket. This made the paint/coating on the lock box crack. I haven't had it installed long enough to get it wet or drive the jeep in the winter so I am curios to see if the cracked paint will promote rust. So all I can say is be careful bolting this sucker down!
B009RZR7Z0|5|All was great and fast!
B003YJJS2U|3|It does cover the jack but it fits very tightly so I doubt it will last very long.  Other than that it is fine.
B00157TGXY|5|great price
B004UKHK7W|5|We used this on dry rotted, leaky rubber slideout roofs. You can see the difference. Easy to apply and cleanup. I advise you wait till you have a day or two of dry weather before applying and to let it cure.
B000JFHMR0|5|Very pleased with the product.
B000GBGNUO|5|Thinner than factory original but works as well
B00PG2QA1K|1|This is a big disappointment! Very poor quality and  flimsy and shorter than most side tables. Not worth $21--I might pay &5 for it.
B00M6RNQNI|5|Super.....
B00BENMA8W|4|it ripped the first week of having it. very cheap fabric.
B007C7GBB6|1|Won't stay tight, no matter how hard you torque down on the lock nuts.  Just pound some hardened steel shims between your shank and receiver.
B0036E9VB6|5|Fast unit.
B000182BAI|5|excellent fit, ride amazing!!!
B00IV855VW|3|Looks okay from a distance. Mine seems to bubble up when it gets cooler and then improves somewhat when hot. Perhaps I was supposed to install it on cool glass, not in the middle of a hot day. I don't know for sure. Could've been my fault but it was $3 and I love Springfield XDs so...
B00DSD4N22|5|Cool
B000HBM6RW|2|Does not work worth the price. I would expect this bar to work better than others or not dissolve/last longer. It lasts just as longer, if not shorter life span and is no different.
B008XZOH8U|5|TRUMP!
B00BGZ3IUC|5|I had broken the part that connects to my key ring so this was exactly what I needed.  Works great.
B004RFKBEO|4|Thanks to everyone that has written a review I was prepared to do some adjustments to the parts if needed so I was not in a rush. A file came in handy to hone down a weld so one bolt would seat correctly and one bike tire loop had to be pounded out so the rod would fit thru (looked like it was damaged in shipping). Other than that it isn't too heavy and holds four mountain bikes nicely two 26&#34; and two 2-24&#34;. Plus it doubles as a cargo carrier.<br /><br />A couple obvious tips: Take your time and study the diagram first. The 8 smaller bolts connect 2 pieces together, the 8 larger ones 3 pieces together. Don't tighten until all bolts are in and seated. It does wobble but the StowAway Hitch Tightener worked great - just order it at the same time. [[ASIN:B0001CMUV4 StowAway Hitch Tightener]]
B00IPS4APU|4|Pros:<br />Works fast<br />Visibly reduced affected area (up to 75%)<br />Prevents further cracking<br /><br />Cons:<br />Does not fully repair the small chips/cracks<br />Resin bottle depleted quickly<br /><br />Other Thoughts: I used this to repair 1 large chip and 4 medium chips, have not tested on large cracks.  By then the resin bottle was empty but only half the curing strips were used. It did visibly reduce the visible damage, especially at the outer edges. Small black discoloration remained in the center of the crack, likely due to resin unable to enter that area. Tapping on and around the chip lightly while the resin is applied helps the smaller air bubbles escape. For $10 you shouldn't expect professional quality results, but its worth it to erase that blemish  if its in your line of sight, and to prevent further cracking. Also, would recommend you keep a paper towel handy to clean up drips that may leak out during the filling process. Would also recommend cleaning the chip/crack from any dirt/debris, as it will prevent the resin from going where it needs to!
B00AAHOYJG|5|excellent
B006J45FVU|1|Order wrong one did not fit 2015 f150
B003YLMPZA|5|Paired with new blower purchase and it works.
B000KKLLFS|5|Good caps. They do their job well.
B00C0SQPZO|5|People are over dramatic about it scratching easily! I've been using for months and it still looks near new. It went on great and is a great addition to my helmet for sunny days.
B00W10XV5I|4|came with two different size screws.  one size were too small(4).
B00QFSAPP6|5|Great product, came as described. More than enough length to wire two spot lights on my Suzuki samurai. Will buy again for the Jeep.
B0030MEJFC|5|sticks like a pro
B000KJPTHU|1|I used turtle wax brand but I heard this was better.  I was very disappointed.
B00M1Y3AJQ|5|Excellent motor oil. Was also an exceptional deal at price point until Amazon raised the price substantially after I bought it.
B007ED84XG|1|The shade is very cute  but it fell apart in less than a week. The suction cups actually came off the shade so there is no way to attach the shade to the window.
B0028NEWCO|2|The fit nice....however they are way smaller then I thought they would be and I don't have a a large head
B002Q1FFY2|5|Easy to install, only took me 30 minutes from start to finish.  I bypassed a few of the step listed by utilizing my motorcycle lift to get under the bike so I didn't need to remove the foot rests. I would recommend these to anyone instead of installing an engine guard and then cursing pegs.
B0024E2S0U|5|Works well, as advertized.
B002IP43B2|5|Fit the bill
B00DHPZWRG|4|It's a little bulky am I'm still trying to get used to it but it does seem to get rid of some of the extra heat.
B00PJIHP8I|5|These are AMAZING! If you are debating purchasing this product..do not.. BUY IT NOW! They are bright and show stopping!
B00TQHHCTK|5|I needed a tire pressure gauge that would read over 80 pounds. This fit the bill perfectly.
B008RW44T6|5|Bought this for my 2003 EVO 8.<br /><br />Pros: Nice quality, it has a nice brushed finish, and is very stong. No bending with tighting.<br /><br />Cons: None
B00CHDKA1M|5|Easy to install!
B002XL2IEA|5|Works well, as advertized.
B000CLJK9O|5|Perfectly!
B00BQYCJNU|4|Very soft and plush, almost too plush if there is such a thing
B00WX6U1TY|5|Great replacement
B002BEC1NC|5|Fits perfectly on my helmet. Looks great.
B002WTHW26|4|Excellent!
B000IYLFTI|5|works great fit real well, with no issue,,,
B00032KC3K|3|Bought 2 packs of 4 screw covers. 1 pack was complete with the 4 covers. The other pack had 2 of the 4 screw covers. My order wasn't complete.
B000CMJW64|5|Perfect.  It keeps my steering wheel nice and cool. It's very soft and comfortable too.
B00KTUY1IS|5|Works very well to reasonably quickly inflate a low tire
B004JAVR4K|5|Works really good, fast deliver
B001G6MLAY|3|Good
B002JOVUO0|5|yes
B00CCSD6CW|3|If you know how to use it, it works. Dont use a hair dryer! It won't work for sharp curves!
B00CI93ZKI|5|Love it - Looks great on my car and has withstood a lot of weather.<br /><br />Would definitely order from this seller again.
B000BRFQLK|4|Inexpensive but works.
B0085YBIXQ|5|Threw these on my 01 ram 1500. Didn't wanna go to big so got 33s with no rubbing ever. Perfect. Maybe could of went bigger but didn't wanna.  Perfect buy
B009APIXRI|2|Worked great for about 2 hours, then the battery goes dead and it's useless.  Easy to remove and set up. Just doesn't last very long.  For this kind of money I would look elsewhere.
B003SOJVEQ|5|Wow.
B00OMSUTJS|5|High quality filter
B00GBW0BLO|4|OEM parts for the low, low gotta love it.
B00VNBEJ1G|5|These lights are amazing! I read all the reviews and not everybody agrees. I think it depends on what kind of car you install them on. Each car will differ. I installed them on a 2010 Toyota Tacoma. I live in the country, so there's no street lights whatsoever. These lights are extremely bright, can see farther and wider. The street signs and road stripes really pop out. I also installed the OPT7 DRL's, which are almost overkill. But when it's pitch black outside, I can see everything. I don't think drivers in front of you appreciate all that brightness, but more cars today come with HID lights and they're just as annoying to other drivers. I would highly recommend these lights to anyone or anything from this company. They put customer service first, which is very hard to find today.
B00368OY4Q|5|great upgrade to fit your new dual core rad. cooler temps and sound.
B003UHMBV6|5|Perfectly!
B000G0T280|5|great for my 97 prelude. 3 in. front and 2 1/2 in. back. nice and stiff, easy install with the right tools.
B00802FT6U|5|Lights work great only draw back does not have 3m tape and instead used brackets you must screw in. Company has wonderful customer service
B00LB4ACQ6|5|Works great
B00WNGV0WG|5|I am so happy with this travel tray. This tray is made soft on purpose for safety (thank goodness!), so that if you were ever in an accident, the table won't injure your child's stomach. It is almost like cardboard inside. There is a lip around the tray so that toys and pens won't slide off at every stop or turn. Plus it's just held &#34;in place&#34; by a strap to go around my son, so it can be removed anytime and used in my car or my husband's. My son uses his iPad in the car, and I'll always try to place something between the iPad and his stomach, but the toddler pillow is too hot during the summer so he sets it aside, and I'm always yelling, &#34;Not on your stomach!!&#34; at him. Now he can place his iPad on the table/tray and I feel very good that he's got it placed on the table instead of directly on his stomach. I'm also kind of glad they went with a neutral color, I'm not too hot on having pastel blue or pastel pink stuff in my vehicle. Product provided at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.
B00JMLY5PO|1|not the right color. Gold tint
B00F6768EY|5|Arrived on-time properly packaged and as represented. Thanks!
B00480FHJC|4|fits my 2008 Jetta, had for about a year now (and the car has DRL), and these are still going, what else can I say? car bulbs.
B00C5TA2QQ|5|It fits very well. Is a great thing, works perfectly.
B009OJ43KQ|1|My winch came already installed from the dealership. It is installed on a 2014 Yamaha Viking. My Viking has only 182 miles on it. The last two trips out I have had problems with the winch not working so I took it off the bike and disassembled the motor cap and found bad seals and corrosion damage under the cap so I called kfi for assistance to find out why? I spoke with Trevor at kfi who is in the tech department and I explained what had happened and he asked how long it sat on the lot at the dealership and I stated that I was not sure. He had me snap some pictures and send them into him. I sent them in and did not receive a call back so I called and he said he got them but it was not covered under warranty because it was water damage. He then proceeded to tell me he could sell me a replacement motor and I asked if this would solve the problem but he said it could happen again! He stated that it is not water proof but only water resistant and if kept in a garage from hot to cold it will create condensation and ruin the motor again. I stated to him that I would not buy another motor that would just do the same thing again is just a little over a year. I explained to him that I had a warn winch on my 08 Yamaha grizzly since new and had been subjected to mud/water/riding and hot/cold garage and it worked perfect for the seven years that I owned that bike. Very very disappointed in the customer service and warranty from kfi!!! I am also including the photos I sent to kfi.
B00U3BTHTG|5|Fantastic bumper package!
B0016C5YF2|2|useful but they need to be beefed up.  I have broken a couple trying to collapse them back down.  For the cost they should have stronger shafts.
B00HWI7QXM|2|Great lights I love the look but the function was horrible for me, the wire harness on my driver side headlight is always shorting out. I've actually got stopped twice by the cops because my light keeps going in and out
B00RA3L8MY|4|bright lights
B002XM5G70|5|It  was just what I needed. Go sale thank you Amazon
B011GY6G74|5|Very simple and easy to install. Satisfied with strength of adhesive!
B00YZOO04E|5|Good
B00PSPUI9K|5|great
B008Z6B3NO|5|Cute sticker :)
B003WZXYH6|5|The best purchase
B00JLJPOB6|1|I believe that it is defective
B000C913S2|4|good
B0072SAB9I|2|This product does not work well on wet car it desolves quick bit great if on dry hot bumper
B000C57XGM|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '94 explorer Sport. No issues. Even though you only need 2 you do in fact receive 10 of these.
B001C9MR36|5|Firmed the rear sunspension up and ride is greatly improved. No issues a few months after install.
B00DJBQ1SW|5|Easy to use, lightweight, and very sturdy.. I've used these ramps without any problems multiple times since purchased. The straps work perfectly the ramps are TOUGH. Would highly recommend.
B001GSMSYG|5|Sugino is THE only choice for new, quality square-taper cranks.  If you are a tandem rider and need a new (or in my casse smaller 170mm) crank, these are visually appealing as well as solidly made.
B000TYQ9G6|5|worked perfect - took about 10 min to replace and restored m 4wd
B000CRO4IK|4|This thing can hold a lot and comes with a sticker to put it in your cup holder, but over time the sticker will lose strength if you put a lot of change into this and it weighs a lot and there is enough room in your cup holder for it to move back and forth
B00VWK6LDC|5|Nice and bright, look great at night
B000EDUUHQ|5|Work very well in small cupboards
B004L5E8NA|5|love it, fits my GLK350 2012 like a glove!
B001DRLPZ8|5|A OK
B001GG29OM|1|Could not get the product to adhere to the glass.
B00CZL4DIW|5|Great! A little hard to do by yourself but with another person fairly easy to accomplish. Fits well
B0002SR4Q8|5|yes!
B0052FRQEQ|2|The fitment was good but they when and changed the screw holes on the back so you cannot use the original factory screws to install this. Good thing I had an array of bolts in the garage and found some that work
B0066SA0KA|5|Awesome.  Look fantastic on my 2003 e320.  Made it look like new
B00XXLZ2O2|5|Works great. No streaks on my car.
B00BDMQCEW|5|Love love love. Got these for Christmas and they fit 2013 Dart perfect.
B008IEVDXS|5|Excellent
B00J62ZTJU|5|Great looking nerf bars and they took about 45 minutes to install. Worked perfect on my 2014 Nissan Frontier.
B00TA5ECJQ|5|I used this siphon over the weekend to drain my snowblower and generator, both which had a fair amount of gas in them left after the brutal New England winter.<br /><br />After completely draining both I've come up with some pros and cons<br /><br />PROS<br />* well built, quality construction<br />* works well regardless of how much gas there is to pump. The &#34;shaker&#34; style siphons need a few inches of gas to get those siphons started<br />* thoroughly drained - I drained so much gas I couldn't start either machine because the tanks were practically bone dry<br />* fuel filter - a must for any siphon for gas. This filter is removable for water based liquids.<br />* the source end is thin enough to fit into a gas tank neck of a car, many other siphons can't do this<br /><br />CONS<br />* not gravity fed, have to pump the bulb to move the gas. So if you have a fair amount of gas or fluid to transfer then you want one that is gravity fed like the [[ASIN:B00N5C28BO GasTapper (TM) Gravity Model - Liquid Transfer Gasoline Siphon Pump 18' of Fuel Hose & Modern Car Adapter - Made in USA - See all 5 models by searching for &#34;GENTAP&#34; in Amazon search bar]]. There is also the [[ASIN:B000EH0ORI Hopkins 10801 FloTool Shaker Siphon with 6' Anti-Static Tubing]] which has great reviews from people that siphon a ton of gas using it, but it has no fuel filter.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />Its a very well made pump, for the few times a year I need to siphon gas (at the end of winter and summer) this is perfect. I had no leaks, or drips - this is a well made product. If I was siphoning more gas I'd go with the gravity version of this pump I mentioned above.
B004BTOTZ8|5|factory fit. fixed my misfire issue.<br />Have only had them installed for less than a week. Will change rating if any issues arise.
B007KDLQY4|5|fit great  will buy again
B000IOJC4I|5|I am very pleased with the prompt service and a decent price for decent product.
B004A42MZI|5|Great product, this activated my new AC Delco sensors when $100 specific TPMS tool would not, including a much more expensive TPMS tool Discount Tire has, this is the real deal worth the $20!
B000ICYC4U|5|This product is a great polish. What ever you apply it to becomes alive. I used it on my  bathroom fixtures and they came to life. If you purchase this product use it on a spoon and compare the polished spoon to one not polished and the Metal Polished Spoon will pop out at you.
B0001EW4FE|5|If follow the directions it works great easy inst5
B00DUTDZIC|2|Arrived on time.  Got almost through the install only to find out it is missing screws.
B000H6P55W|5|We have used this for all long road trips  for the past 3 years, it works great!  We have driven through snowstorms, rain storms and the things inside didnt have a drip of water in it! Awesome bag!
B001URQUN8|1|Pice of s***
B004YIDDSA|5|Very durable. Exactly what my husband was looking for for his company work truck. And he has given it a beating since installing it and it is holding up just like new
B00I8SIT8Q|3|Finally got around to putting this on and this was an fairly easy install with help from you-tube. Immediate improvement over the Yoshimura exhaust as far as exhaust note even with all the baffles in. I removed the baffles and OMG this thing sounds like a beast. It's not loud and rattled sounding like those that just take of the muffler. It has a very throaty race bike sound to it. I notice drivers looking in their mirrors to investigate the sound which makes me feel a lot safer. Get lots of compliments on the look and the sound.<br />Now for my only complaint. I originally got this because I really like the shiny blue tip. It matched the rest of the anodized blue custom parts perfectly and really made the bike pop. I have not been running the pipe for very long, maybe 2-3 months since install for 22 miles/3-5 days a week. The blue finish is almost non-existent at this point and looks almost a pale blue/silver. Not sure if it was just a bad tip and didn't hold up to the heat, but really disappointed and don't want to spend the $$$ on a new tip if the heat will just fade it again. If it wasn't for this I would give it 5 stars.
B00B3HXMBI|5|Good stuff
B004UTCY6A|5|beautiful
B0079QRT66|3|Great bag overall.  On first use, the velcro straps in the back failed, allowing the bag to slam into the rider's back.  It has D-rings, so we just used cable ties to attach it to the ATV rack instead of the velcro.
B00A3VPDT4|5|Perfect....
B007Y0CYN0|5|Excellent product and prompt delivery.
B004EQ8882|5|Just like it was posted
B00KWDR3JQ|5|Works as expected. Easy to install.
B0055FFMGM|4|would like to have another gray or black one in the bunch but the scarfs are great.
B0085IJXCU|5|Exact fit...perfect replacement part.
B00076RLHW|2|Normally I consider customer reviews with a grain of salt.  Some people you just simply cannot please, no matter how good the product.  I consider the CURT 31114 an excellent product, but for what truck?  The front receiver hitch I purchased was supposed to fit a 99 F250SD, only requiring installer to drill a couple holes.  As long as you don't plan to reinstall the front bumper, that's exactly how it will go.  To reinstall the front bumper requires adding spacers between the receiver mounting surface and the bumper mounting surface, which kicks the bumper unusually forward.  This info is not to be found in product information or in the installation guide, which is almost worthless.  I read there would be challenges in the product reviews, and thought &#34;no way a manufacturer would sell the assembly for an application it was not suited for!&#34; They took my dime and proved me wrong.  Product is great, two stars!!  The design/fit is a pitiful &#34;fail&#34;, minus three stars! I will make this work because I need it now, but I will be more cautious with CURT products in the future. Changed my mind.  placed hitch against frame mounts and hole were 1/2' skewed.  Had it one day, then dropped this pos in the mail for a refund.  I'll try another brand and see how that goes.  Price was right, but way too much effort even at that price.  Hope I can find one built as well that fits.
B004GSPEKI|5|Love the scent. The scent is so powerful as the other revierwers had stated so I dint take it completely out of the packet, revealed a little portion of the material at the top n left the cover on. My car smells so good now.
B00IKPSPK4|5|better than ebay
B000VAOH8K|2|Gauge appears to not work on a consistent basis.  Will have to send to manufacturer to remedy
B000FQ1PYY|5|Work great
B0096EFVBO|5|Great product
B001H494DC|4|worth the money....
B00O83SM0A|4|Great product
B00GJX1L6Y|5|Easy to install.
B0081K3RLK|5|Defenders of the force!
B000E4JWJ2|5|Got it installed it . the mirror fits perfectly looks and works just like the original .
B000C2O8ZE|5|as advertised
B0002KKIXC|5|Buy this for cleaning carpets. It especially useful for cleaning in cars.
B00GRHRTEU|5|Great price. Very easy to install. Any one that has heated mirrors on their  Jeep Wrangler these mirrors are the best option for removingy your doors. The mirror relocation kits do not work with heated mirrors due to the heating element wires. With these mirrors you don't have to remove the factory mirrors. Plus the mirrors are about the same size as the factory mirrors. They stay tight and in place evenat high speeds on the highway.
B007G2KIDE|5|Verry nice carpet and a great price. Love it !! :)
B0068543T0|1|Didn't work for me having to take to a car audio place all it did was blow fuses.
B00INVEQUI|5|Very useful for running new circuits in a car. Wire is good quality.
B00CF13SP6|4|I love this keychain, I would just have the logo placed on both sides of it.
B00HRZVC6W|5|Great, Mats are of good quality. Happy with this purchase.
B00C0SQ8KG|4|bien
B00YUZD5HQ|1|Could not get the fob programmed to work with my 2012 Jeep. The SKIM could be programmed, but the keyless entry could not. Now I'm out 27 bucks.
B00B2YE2GQ|5|It´s nice.
B005WIS2M8|4|This item is really small which I knew from description. size does effect play on some games so the 4 star rating.  On whole we enjoy this game set it is a welcome addition to our game chest and travels ever so well. I would buy this again or gift it to a friend.
B0052FRY6Q|1|This product is not at all as pictured, The product photo shows interior electric door handles and the product is for a manual lock. They will not work with an electric lock. In addition, if you click additional details, the Product Description states exterior handles which is also incorrect.<br /><br />If you are looking for manual lock interior handles, this product is for you.
B00CFH9LO2|3|Nice product. It fits expectations
B001FANQXC|5|Installed easier than anticipated. Did NOT come with the vacuum pump relocation kit, but didn't need it as a 2015 has bolts instead of studs so no cutting or grinding was necessary.  Pump is low enough in stock location. Every bolt, nut, and spacer was there.
B00LH4M420|4|Good product. Not Raptor big, but not too small either. Clips that come with are worthless. I would recommend some sheet metal screws with washers. Looks good and an awesome price.
B00IW33T5A|5|yes!
