B0028EVH7G|4|good quality
B008UR7J6I|5|The interface is not exactly a snug fitting connection for a '99 Accord, but as long as I don't move the unit it won't fall out.  Otherwise the unit works and transmits data as expected.  I'm not a mechanic or well read on OBDII, so if you are a DIYer like me, this unit requires you to read the instructions and play with it so you can understand its functionality. The whole reason I purchased this is to get a jump on the diagnosis if the check engine light should come on and it's necessary to visit a mechanic.  Additionally it's important that you learn and comprehend the setup of the software and output readings otherwise you might as well spend hundreds of dollars taking it to a shop to be diagnosed and fixed, defeating the whole purpose.
B000CPI6VI|5|Used to convert my 06 Jeep Grand Cherokee to the 4 pin hook up on my jetski trailer.  Adapter fits well.
B00SA8T7CQ|5|Ir is a great product
B0077FIVPW|3|That was purchased for a 2007 Malibu Maxx. The coil does the job butit's not a perfect fit. Had to grind the opening on the tab above the hose connection so that it would fit properly on the alignment tab coming off the radiator. Hose connection worked fine.
B0007ZDRSU|5|My  favorite interior car dressing.  I used this on my first car and I still love it  7 cars and 25 years later.  The aroma is fantastic too.
B004Q8819E|5|Fits  perfect in my F250. thank you
B000YCAMXY|5|i got this one time and it was durable and really nice when its raining or snowing and u want to have the window down! it install easy and is very strong material. i would recommend. i got a 04 chevy silverado ext cab
B006P89NWW|1|Totally disgusted with this company, They send whatever they like and not the product you pay for. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone, do NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!!
B00B2YHHCW|4|just as labeled.so far they are nice and bright and cool looking lights!!!will see how long they last,for the price if they last they are worth it!!
B008Y6W3UC|4|They drained my battery when my engine was off and lights still on.  Also noticed flicking but not sure if that was my lights or the ballast.  Worked for my lights and way better then the ones I had before.  Worth getting and trying out!
B007AXVN8I|5|Simple and nice lip. In my opinion makes the car look mean. Easy to install.
B000CMJ0YI|1|This product only fit four out of six stake pockets of a 2010 Silverado. Even then they started to pull out of the pockets and I had to stop tightening the load. The eyes and threaded rods are separate pieces and the rods were starting to corrode after only two months when I replaced them with another Highand product that was far superior. It has no rubber blocks but plates that fit inside the stake pockets and one piece eyes with threaded ends.I can not reccomend this model.
B0013VT5N8|5|These plate covers are low profile, so I am thinking they will work with most plate frames. They are not a simple flat clear film type shield, meaning they have a rim and the face will not touch your plates. Imbedded UV protection, so I am hoping the Arizona heat won't make them yellowed and unattractive. You don't want to get pulled over just because your plates are not visible enough! The price I paid was half of most online stores and I am happy about that. If you have specialty plates you will appreciate the protection, as plate covers keep them nice. I bought a frame from Car Decor and wanted a nice cover as well. These shields work perfect for my frame and complete a finished look. I would recommend these to others.
B000K7OG9O|5|Good quality and fit well, No problems, Satisfied. Made with good quality leather. Studs mounted firmly, makes the bike look great. RAM.
B00B1F0INW|4|The packages stay put!!
B0055DQVQO|3|The seller should use a more appropriate &#34;universal image&#34; for the product that they are selling.<br />It gives the buyer the feeling that they are getting an complete replacement kit when they are *NOT*
B002MQMM4M|1|I had it in two days but when I  was going to install it I figure some pieces were broken in the inside, I had to put crazy glue then put it together, I did not return it because I was driving without a mirror and I didn't wanted to get a ticket other wise i would send it back.
B000E35UV2|4|Easy to install and works.
B00J2CI3TW|1|I would not recommend these ! There cheap I received mine broken ! And the one that was not broken was as bright as a dead flash light ! Does not improve any driving conditions
B00G8DUZGW|5|Just got it cut yesterday after receiving it in the mail from amazon. Shipping was quick, only about 8 days, got it as a spare, but it looks amazing and sturdy so now it's my main key. Came slightly warped, key was slightly bent but pliers fixed it quick. When I got it cut I bought the stores spare as well just in case this one didn't work.....Put it in the ignition and she started right up. Love it and I'm buying 3 more this Friday. (I ride a 2002 Yzf R1 and would recommend it to anyone who needs a new key, or would just like a much better looking one.
B009NL093U|4|It's a keychain. Nothing to get excited about. I've had it for two weeks and the paint hasn't chipped or faded. It holds my Legacy key and keyfob perfectly. Is it supposed to do more? It looks good and the ring is high quality. No complaints.
B00LBOK8JW|4|Not sure where the size is on the packaging, but I ordered the thin type (4.2&#34; diam) and received the (4.5&#34; diam). Nice lights but now I have to return and reorder, very annoying.
B0054YCW62|1|Cheap junk.  I bought two of these...thankfully.  I needed them both for one trip.  One shredded on the trip up...the other on the trip back.  Buy rope instead of these...you will be better off.  Also, there is no way to keep the clips fastened to the net, so they fall off and you lose them.
B0019891NO|3|Product works but forget it staying in place. Needs a stronger nut and bolt. Does not stay in place. Oh well looks like I will just need to get a larger nut and bolt with a wing nut.
B000XQ8OP4|5|Car in front of me threw up a board that punched a hole right through my bumper.  Did not want to spend the money to take it to the shop.  Luckily the hole was in a good spot where this bumper would normally go, so I put the bumper pad over the hole and presto looks like new.  To balance the appearance, I put the other pad symmetric from the center line on the other side of the bumper.  Adherence is very good and the color matches my silver 2007 Camry SE.
B0006JLW34|5|perfect replacement for the original plug. makes draining the system very simple.  I reccomend this mod to anyone with a hot water tank in their RV.
B005NLQAHS|5|Just being able to reset engine codes alone is worth the $20.00.  everything else it does is a bonus.  no more trips to the auto parts store to get engine codes.  Well worth the price.
B0002LBKF6|5|it is easy to remove and does a good job of removing light oxidation..followed up with Meguiar's Gold. very Nice.
B001ACE6KW|5|Very nice gloves. I ordered a Large and they seem to be pretty accurate in terms of sizing. The overall fit and finish is very good and they seem like a quality product. I have not ridden with them yet, but will update when I do. The gel pads on the palms are a nice feature too. Overall, I am happy with my purchase.
B00B57UYSA|4|Great cover up for my dash. I've noticed that alero dash covers peel up after a couple years. Mine started to peel up really bad and so did the airbag cover. So I bought this and it works great! Looks so much better! Has little sticky pieces on back to stick to dash but it didn't even use them. You just have to bump it up once in awhile. Makes my car look so much better!
B008X032DG|1|Save your money and buy a brand name like KYB.<br />These clunked and rattled with in 6 months.<br />Absolute Junk
B008NQL00W|5|This is a must have for App Radio 2 users since it requires a double pulse to bypass the parking break. Instals quickly.
B0006JLW5M|5|just order the right size.  it fit just fine and has survived a 2700 mile trip.  looks good.  not quite as heavy as what came out so may not last 20+ years.  but happy with it for sure.
B000JQQQKS|1|What a disappointment as these really don't work as bungee cords since they stretch out and do not have any tension. So, they work as ropes with hooks on the end! I've tried all the different color sizes and they all do the same. Don't expect these to &#34;bungee&#34; if that's what you are looking for. These are going in the trash.
B001GG09GW|5|Awesome I love it
B006P88TJ0|5|cool
B0012DRW2I|5|Living in Arizona, you have to have one of these.  reduces the temperature in your vehicle and keeps the sun off your interior.  Worth every penny.
B007PYFFXQ|3|The sticker was printed forwards, not mirrored, therefore making it hard to use as a window sticker. I don't think it will last long if I put it on the outside of my car, so I'm not very sure what to do with it. Also, as someone else mentioned, the sticker is in the shape of a clear square- not just the fish. Another small thing is that the fish is printed opposite of the picture shown, but as I said, the words are facing forward on the sticker. I can't complain about how fast it shipped, the concept of the sticker, or the price.
B004SG55UC|5|Best of the best.
B0015D4ZH0|5|The winch was shipped in a timely manner. Installation was easy, and bolted right up to my mounting bracket. The winch has plenty of power to lift my plow, so glad I didn't pay the high dollar at the dealership for a winch.
B001O0ZA3W|5|Great fit. Looks good and only too three days.
B00326S1YG|5|The mats fit perfect and the qualiy is very good for the price the site was easy to use and I love the color
B00C4YL27A|5|You cant ask for much more in a dirt bike stand. It's night and day compared to putting my bike on the triangle stand.
B001EMRU24|5|Just perfect!!!
B000UVUAFO|4|I used this on some small light scratches and a medium scratch that it still said it could cover. When it says to barley sand for a few seconds, listen to it! If you sand too much you can sand more than just the clear coat off and it would result in a dull finish. Even with their clear coat protector, it still doesn't look like it did, but it works great to fill in small scratches and Not be noticed.
B0094JINKC|5|it fit great
B005NLQAHS|5|It works perfectly. With the right software, you can do anything on the car! I use it on multiple vehicles
B003ECULUU|2|The sliding (sideways)  part was not big enough to block the sun from my problem area on side front windows. There was a gap at the top when slid to the rear of the window.
B00480J4KA|5|Ordered 2 of these on Friday for my Lexus is300 (standard shipping). Expected delivery was marked for next Friday, but I received the package on Tuesday. Came packaged nicely in the box as pictured. These bulbs were an exact fit for my 2002 Lexus IS300. They match the original HID lights that my car had before they died. I'm very happy that I spent $~80 as opposed to the $100 a piece that the auto store wanted for these. Installation was a breeze. I did it myself, took about 15 minutes. Very happy with this order. I've only had these installed for one day.
B000EDUUJO|5|Pretty simple. Exactly as described and cheaper than buying from our overpriced local RV store.
B00064NWH8|4|works just fine use in my trailer trailer  the long cord workswell. ihave not one prolble with this i like it.
B0041U93Y4|5|BRAND NEW, TOYOTA BRAND. [ DEALER TRIED TO TELL ME NOT TOYOTA. IT SAID TOYOTA RIGHT ON THE PLASTIC, AND FIT PERFECT FAR LESS THAN DEALER PRICE.
B0007INADY|5|Older cars are great to work on and ensuring things are done quickly and right this is a superior reprint to get all things right. Received book fast and this is a good group to do business with.
B0066TCRN2|4|Product works great just needed to do some touch up on some of the inside walls due to some left over slag.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Work as expected.
B00OVBBZQW|4|Good beefy rack. There was a little bit of muscling needed to get it lined up with the factory mount points, but nothing extreme. I have only used it so far for soft luggage, but plan to try my metal panniers soon.
B000AY68SO|5|Sturdy, looks like it is shown.
B004YEJ9Z0|4|Its sticks really well, nice size, maybe a little too big for me but still looks good. A little retro :)
B000BY6HCA|5|Fits my 2007 Corvette perfectly and keeps the interior noticeably cooler when it must be left out in the sun
B000CMHTTQ|5|Thank you.
B004A35K76|5|Super fast delivery.  Works as it should.  I bought this to replace the exact same original model which was damaged when I accidentally connected the coach to 250V instead of the normal 125V on an out of state trip.  I had Amazon Prime ship to the campground and received it in two days.  Could not have asked for more!<br /><br />On a side note, after removing the cover on the old converter, I discovered the damage was limited to a MOV and a fuse.  I replaced both and now have a spare converter.
B0002KR88A|2|The item that arrived is NOT as pictured. The fuse holder arrives with a loop of insulated wire with no cut ends ot stripped leads. What arrived is a loop of wire with a fuse holder and fuse in it.
B0031WCJ7Q|1|PROS:<br />-Cheap.<br />CONS:<br />-Cheap.<br />-Bad fit.  Fabric is thin and loosens in warmer weather which makes the side windows disconnect and flop around at higher speeds.<br />-Stitching disintegrated after 2 years, rendering it useless.<br />-\\"OEM\\"(original equipment manufacturer)? Really?<br />THE TAKEAWAY:<br />-If you plan to keep your car for a while, save your pennies and spurge for the $400 top.  This is essentially junk you buy when selling your car.
B00126IDDC|5|I have several and testing them on vent fans that run all night and a new 80 watt fridge.  Solar collects sun and batteries have enough to power other appliances at night when the sun is down.
B009HB84WE|4|Seat is very sleek and good looking. Lowers ride height a little and seats further back about an inch. for some rotating or getting higher bars may be necessary as i am 5'7\\" and am past the comfort level with being almost straight at the elbow. i was a little disappointed with the backrest as the height adjustment is just notches that do not really stay in raised position and also wobbles side to side a little during ride. Comparing to Harley spring loaded system,I prefer the Harley. To the good, the seat so far is amazingly comfortable but have yet to take it on a 200+ mile ride. Time will tell. It is one if the best looking solo seats in my opinion. I bought for a street glide and completes the bagger look when tour pack is off. Quality seems top notch, cover is riveted, not stapled on. Foam does not get we when washing and small fender bib is a nice finishing touch. The seat is a bit narrower at tank no giving that riding a barrel feel. For the price on here, I really couldn't be happier apart from the back rest
B002UX1T78|5|I installed these last year in my 2001 Subaru Outback.  They're noticeably brighter than the original equipment bulbs.  A nice clear white light.  Since they are only high beams they don't aggravate oncoming drivers as long as you dim them.  I hope they last another 18 months but at this point I consider them acceptably long lived.  I will buy them again.      Amazon sells good stuff but trust your owners manual, not their make and model \\"Make sure it fits\\".  They OK'd these for the Outback but they're clueless about the H1 low beams.
B005BNG1U4|4|Nice pad for the money and the Jeep writing stands out well. The velcro attachment is off to the side for a comfortable fit, Perfect for the price!
B000K009TM|5|They fit perfect and sound great good investment. Definitely  order again.
B000BQW5LK|5|fit like a glove and worked just as it should
B000JZN0SU|5|Good quality and price.
B0093OHWUA|3|It does keep groceries from sliding to the front of my Avalanche. I wish it had a pocket as sometimes things kind slide underneath.
B005EST0QI|4|Part was as described and connected well. No complaints other than that the mirror is a cheap &#34;objects may appear closer&#34; mirror
B00LWGFWRC|5|Nice very bight
B0074E2IKA|5|Excellent quality. The dog is well made and the VW kerchief stands out.My daughter has pet this guy every morning on the way to school for weeks and it still looks great. She has been known to de-hair some plush animals. While I would have liked it a little softer, my daughter has slept snuggling up to it in her car seat.
B005GGM33A|5|I just bought these to protect my floors in the upcoming winter. They fit right in without any trouble. Thank you WeatherTech!
B00CI7W8DA|1|Did not fit my bike right at all
B00A8MZ7IA|5|these things are great thank you for the fast delivery
B007R6JTAC|3|It fit ok. Not bent right
B00JA392IY|2|These wiper blades did not include any adapters for connectors other than J-type connector. Amazon listed this blade as a direct fit for cars that do not have J-type connector. Other far cheaper blades i have used in the past have always included a handful of different adapter
B0053SKJAK|5|Delivered on time and it worked as intended. no complaints here.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Handy way to travel!!! We went to the Smoky Mountains for the week of Thanksgiving and we packed the bag as tight as it would pack and did great!!! The construction of this bag is well more than I expected!! We have a 2012 Dodge Journey and with three kids across the back seat we need the extra &#34;dry storage&#34;. Without paying what a hard shell costs we found what we needed with this bag!! I'm proud of my decision to purchase this storage bag!!!
B005BNZ59M|2|Does not dissolve solids completely and has caused issues that required outside contractor to fix
B00BL9HIEK|5|I bought this skull ash tray for the members of my Death Cafe that smoke. Since many of the Death Cafe's around the world have a skull in their logo, this is very suitable. It also says &#34;Love&#34; next to the skull though, so I don't have to be afraid that my smoking friends would feel that I condemn their smoking :-)
B009M8WV4E|5|I would recommend to anyone!  It certainly looks better than the boring old gold bow that comes standard with Chevrolet!
B001C6IVZC|1|This mount will not fit 08 Nissan Altima.your correct fit list needs work !!!
B001UJB96E|3|A bit too thin for my peferences in microfiber towels.
B0009IQXFO|5|I like this wash Shampoo and Conditioner.  I suds up, but not too much.  Works well washing up my cars.  Also, I really like the smell.
B000C2SBFM|5|Part was a perfect fit and excellent quality.
B008XDMCT8|5|Bought this for my 2014 Carrera 4S and it fits beautifully. I received this item in no time, and I absolutely love it.
B000E300OY|5|This fitted almost perfect on my 1988 jeep cherokee laredo.  The only  little issue was that the bottle was a little loose inside the support strap. But isn't no big deal. Bottle isn't going anywhere. This does come with a cap. And xap fit very well on bottle.  Installation only took me about 10 minutes.
B00KHX6WMU|5|Perfect !  I was skeptical about the programming method but it worked like a charm first time !  Great product I will order another one today!
B00NCTS7P6|4|The shipping was very, very fast which I loved. But when opened it did have a weird chemical smell, not of wood like others have said. The case fit perfect, but it is very difficult to get off and feels a bit cheap. I haven't dropped the phone yet but the case does feel a bit flimsy. I think it will protect the phone, but if dropped on a hard surface like wood flooring and concrete it will most likely crack. Other than that, it's a great looking case. Let's hope it's sturdy than it feels.
B0002KR88A|4|This thing is great. Electricity goes right through it. Real fast too.
B000RH0LFK|5|This adds to the safety of riding on the streets. I want everybody to see me. So far this product has worked as advertised.
B00G3RIV46|1|i did not even get it
B00077KWI6|1|I am returning the cargo mat for a 2012 Chrysler Town and Country.  For years I have purchased WeatherTech for every car, but they blew it with this measurement.  It falls about two inches short on each side wall of fitting, that's four inches off on the measurement.  Possibly on the earlier Town and Country it was correct but not this one.  I also purchased for the first two rows and a perfect fit.  I called WeatherTech and received less than a satisfactory reply with the complaint.
B000B8GAPK|2|wrong product. If I would have gotten the right thing I would have been happy. I would still like my gas caps.
B000DLBHP8|3|It's great horns for a low price, doesn't sounds like a clown car at all. Sport cars have higher pitch sound. It's the main point, that make them differ from a trucks :)<br /><br />Finally I found metal air horns, that makes great quality sound. I tried many plastic horns, FIAMM, HELLA, and others, none of them make me fully happy. It's better to spend little more, to buy a metal version. I found horns same model, that available in plastic and in metal, version in metal produce reach sound. It's like a music for a ear.<br /><br />The main problem of plastic horns that I found using audio recordings on hq mic, they absorbs some frequencies. So you hear only part of sound.
B001KSDZOO|4|Shipped in ordedly fashion part was a perfect match and quality part thanks
B000KYX076|5|Product arrived quickly and exactly as posted.
B0073W281W|5|Good price works well easy install
B0007D5DZC|5|As described
B00KPYU5WE|5|Direct replacement for my 2006 F150. Solved the issues I was having with the transmission.
B0009XXGZY|2|Though it says this belt is for 2003 Ford Focus SE, I found this don't fit my car. Just waste of my time
B0000AXE6C|4|Good item and I'd give it 5 star but for price.  I didn't have any choice but to pay a hefty price.
B004AHC2Z0|4|fine quality and included fuse puller, and fair price overall. Just wish they were more clear as to the scale; hard to distinguish from the different sizes of fuses and they all look the same otherwise.
B00B4F6U6S|5|I use this kit when rebuilding old Honda Trail 90 engines.  Fit and quality is excellent.  Be careful installing the camshaft seal, it can tear or lose it's spring (oil it first).
B000VKTUD2|5|Fits, filters, works. Put it in my 2008 4Runner
B00K4WRPKM|5|Good
B001TM3YAG|5|This is a great open face helmet. I have purchased Shoei in the past and they run true to size every time. Additionally, the shipping time was super! Very pleased with this purchase.
B00GIWIK0Q|3|I purchased this product with the handybar for my mom.  When you pull on the handle it tends to bring the door towards you also, the car window must be slightly open to use and install.  But it can be useful if you connect it to the handle inside your car. Between the two product I would stick with the handybar.
B0062BHOOG|1|I ordered this with the Campbell-Hausfield inflator. The air pump works just fine. I had it set to 40# for our bikes.<br />The new Viair registered 1.5# I used my old pocket gauge and it registered 40#. so the air gauge isn't worth<br /> sending it back - just threw it in wastebasket. It was a little difficult to get it on the valve properly but never registered anything near 40#.
B008596ES0|5|looks so clean in the cabin of my STi, i love perrin they make great products. Im glad i got the fat knob as it fits perfect in my hand and the perfect weight.
B00B54SJIK|4|Works well - pretty easy to install.  A good solution for Bluetooth use of cell phone in an older car.
B000CITK8S|5|this tender is the best also have 3 more for my Harley's
B000C2UI4E|5|still working quietly !
B0016I8E1M|5|This was exactly what we needed, it is strong and well built. Much better quality than others I had looked at.
B0069TND14|5|I love them . I have bought multiple pairs.
B007A8J67S|5|Found this in the warehouse deals as used, but brand new in box and still is. I used the old chain and have this as a spare.
B0051D3MP6|5|Love these, great product, comes with other attachments goodies. I have 3 of them, all on my motorcycles.
B0041CDORE|4|Works well for the most part. Put this on my 13 road glide with Ness big sucker air cleaner and baffle free mufflers. Also removed the cat. Performance is good other than a little uneven popping from pipes while descending hills. Show me a Harley that doesn't do that and I'll eat my hat!
B001Y8Y58U|5|I popped the old ones out and put the new ones in.  I have to say, they stay very snug on the wheel of the car and look pretty cool and a discreet kind of way.
B000N5UVME|5|Love these!  Super easy to put on and sound great.
B000FQ7RJ6|2|not as well made as original. The springs are smaller than the original.
B001CA784I|1|Put these on my truck which was a pain in the rear end and hard on this old man's back. Spent another hour trying to figure out why my truck ran worse than when I put these on. Finally had to get my shop to look at it. There was a wire that was bad. They didn't seem too surprised about it and they said it happens. I was not amused. Next time I will buy these locally so I can get some money back if something like this happens. Learning the hard way.
B00GR2W6CU|5|Good strong bright material
B00IV72IY0|5|Easy install on Honda Fit...
B000BUU5YU|5|This is a well built cable with very robust easy to grip handles. The cable does not get hot even under heavy load of my 15k air conditioner.
B00AZFZGMC|5|excellent low profile design
B0000C6F0W|4|It works as expected.
B009TC50LE|5|Unit fit fine and black color also worked out with out having to paint.
B00KTHQR0Q|5|Worked perfectly on my 04 Dodge Ram. A little chintzier than the OEM remote but well worth the money.
B00D6MO898|5|these worked perfect and were exactly what was needed for the application (2011 charger) Installed HIDs flawlessly. would recommend to anyone
B00RD4D9AO|5|Packaged well. Easy to install. Top Quality!
B00067BVDC|5|What I love about these bulbs is that they are incredibly bright and white in color.  Neither yellow nor blue, they produce pure white light.  If you look at the headlight assembly when the bulb is off you can see a slight blue-ish tint.  Definitely buying a set for every car that I own.
B00429YAA6|3|works great
B0082LJMC6|5|This stuff is awesome! As an artist, I want my work to last, and this stuff does it!
B00877SL2M|5|All bulbs worked.if bulbs done work at first just take them out and turn them around. Package came a day sooner than expected.  Very pleased.bulds are nice and bright
B00BITI6Q2|5|Perfect fit for my 2002 Toyota Corolla LE.  Installation was very easy.  I'm very glad I made the purchase.
B00NJ903MY|1|Got a set of 880 bulbs. One of them broke when I twisted it in the light fixture. Cheep plastic now there are broken pieces of plastic stuck inside my fog light.
B0002RNSIC|5|Works Perfect! Plugged right in, wired properly so all the lights do what they should, everything is great with this product.
B001SGC45E|4|I'm sure it will work great...I just didn't need it as the tail light I bought came with one. Maybe you guys could advertise that a little more clearly so that idiots like me don't waste $15 bucks on a needless part that will cost that same amount to return!
B004C443RG|5|I bought these gloves for my dad who uses them to protect his hands from the sun while driving.  He wears them all the time and loves them.  He said they were very comfortable and are getting softer every time he wears them.  I am glad I purchased them.
B00027H0HM|2|I ordered 2. One had no hardware with it and one works intermittently....I have to press the trim switch about 10 times with nothing but a click each time before it finally powers up the motor....the up solenoid works correctly. so,  it is not the motor or the switch.
B00DYXPD5C|5|Well done, great job! Thank you.
B003S8DZ3U|3|1 star if you don't have two active keys already as it will cost $89 to cut and program this second key.<br /><br />5 stars if you have two active keys already as it will then cost you nothing to do it yourself for this third key.<br /><br />So... that is either $12.50 for another key, or $101.50 for another key. All depends on how many keys you have now.<br /><br />UPDATE: These particular keys (grey colored) do not need to be programmed, just cut. It is the black colored keys that need to be programmed.
B00026Z3E0|4|work good, like the locking pin, makes me feel safe
B00KDV9RC8|5|I put this sticker on my garage refrigerator a spoof. The green color is strong with clear borders on the white portion. The die-cut edge make me give this simple sticker an A+.
B00BR5L3QW|5|Helmet looks exactly as pictures!  Fits perfectly and I ordered exact to my size despite reviews I read about sizing up. Took 5 days to deliver, (awesome sauce) and I love the many vents it has for air flow! Over all I'm pleased! Oh and it's lighter in weight than I expected which is also a plus!
B000GZTEP6|5|Took less than 30 minutes and two beers to install.  Rode 1100 miles the next day in weather as cold as 17 degrees.  Heated gloves worked 500% better than usual.  Unplugged them on return trip due to lack of need.  Other riders were quite envious.  If your hands get cold and wet and your joints ache then I strongly suggest these awesome wind deflectors.  You are much much safer when you can operate your switches, levers and controls quickly and comfortably.  DON&#34;T BE A CHEAPSKATE!  Get these!  Of course you can choose to just keep using the cold as an excuse not to ride and accept yourself for the weak weanie you are.
B0013LJ5NS|5|Fast and simple.  Stronger than OEM.  Stainless steel insert should not rust with the bolt.  Suggest you do both sides because the bolt sizes are larger than OEM and it will save time swapping wrenches.  I used a strong magnet to get out the remainder of the steel bolt that broke off when my OEM bolts seized.
B00M5YC7Q4|3|Great product. Disappointed my 2 switches I ordered didn't come with jumper wires.
B000B5XV82|5|Great price fast delivery
B0036E9VB6|5|A must have for the trails!  Works great and fills tires up quickly.  I used this along with the Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On so I could connect straight to the battery.
B008QXZ6Z2|1|Wrong item for me- returned
B004MWS8OM|5|Rack was well packaged. Came with 1 gasket to protect paint and 2 bolts with nuts. One metric and other standard which was nice.
B007QQO40S|1|Mirrors snapped with slight movement and screws broke off with minimal torque. Way too short for a motorcycle. The photography is deceiving, the mirrors are not quality.
B007G7PWYY|5|make my engine smooth, a little bit more power, sounds great when you put your foot on the floor, it is good for your engine, clean, save your gas. my car is subaru 2012 forester 2.5X. fb25 engine. i will use this oil on my old audi a4.
B004W4OHJU|5|The lights were a big improvement from the old stock headlights. Installation was very easy, just followed the supplied directions.
B000QR6XJ4|5|Effective, non sticky and non toxic.
B0027A6PAA|5|Fit with minor adjustments and fixed my problem!
B000I16FB4|5|THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS PRODUCT OTHER THAN IT WORKS AS IT SHOULD. I NEEDED A PISTON RING COMPRESSOR TO INSTALL THE PISTONS IN MY '76 HONDA CB400F MOTORCYCLE ENGINE. THE PISTONS ARE SMALL, SO I HAD TO HAVE A RING COMPRESSOR THAT WOULD WORK ON PISTONS A BIT UNDER 2 INCHES IN DIAMETER. I DID A SEARCH ON AMAZON AND PICKED THIS PRODUCT BASED ON THE DESCRIPTION AND PRICE. IT ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND WAS EASY TO USE, THOUGH BETTER INSTRUCTIONS WOULD HAVE HELPED--I'M NOT A VERY EXPERIENCED MECHANIC, BUT I FIGURED IT OUT AND IT WORKED WELL.
B0058WXNOK|1|if you want to spend 10+ hours on fixing your lether chairs, this may be a good product for you, but if not, do not waste your money on this thing.
B0002MABGE|4|It installs easy, and stays in place. My determined german shepherd couldn't get through it or knock it down. Made from quality materials, this item doesn't give me the impression that it could break easy. My only gripe with it, is actually just how it is designed to be universal. The edges of the barrier slide out (like a trombone) to accommodate wider vehicles. This is great, and gives a custom fit and feel. Other only problem is there is no way to secure them in that position. So my dog would occasionally slide them over enough to get her head through and lick my passengers. Not a huge problem, after they were gorilla taped in place.
B004STOM58|1|I may have not thoroughly read description but not as good of quality as I was expecting,  felt like a fake police badge for Halloween looks nice....
B0016KFW1U|5|Great hitch, much beefier than the factory hitch.  We haul a 7500 lb travel trailer over all types of roads.  We've been down 2 tracks, logging roads in Maine, etc. while hauling the trailer.  I think I would be nervous with the factory hitch on there when going over some of the bumps we did.  This hitch is obviously not the weak link.  I really appreciate how it also attaches much further up the frame closer to the rear axle than the factory hitch which also reduces the strain on the rear frame of the vehicle.  Definitely the right choice, we have it on our 2003 2500 4x4 8.1L Suburban.
B003HB5VIU|1|terrible , bought them for Honda std 15 inch wheel,  they dont make a snug fit,  i went 3 blocks and lost<br />one,  of corse i could hav  used  furnace black cement to hold them on,  but, when i get a flat<br />forget it.......they do give clips and tension ring,  that doesnt help
B001GS0DJ8|4|Works great.  The only problem is I have a four door but the deflectors on came for the front doors.
B001AIZ5HY|5|Made my headlights look like new.  Took about 2.5 hours and was a little scary.  But follow the instructions and you will have new looking headlights!!
B004L0P1M2|5|I got this pretty quick that works great
B00825FB9U|5|What a difference these new light has made to the overall appearance of the car at night.  All lights were plug and play with absolutely no issues with install.
B004PNRCJA|1|These towels are generous in size, only they are not absorbent.  Water beads literally stand on the fabric, as if it contains a water-repellent.  Nothing wipes dry; instead it smears water over surfaces.  So far, they are useless.  They will probably require many washings before they might prove useful.  Only time will tell.
B000LT6WXE|5|Awesome product fit perfectly also provided spacers for the oil dipstick and plug wire holders.<br />The headers also gave my truck a seat of the pants improvement has more pep and seems like a bit better mph.
B007VP2CI0|3|not for led glow but fits well for M3 E36 99. I was hoping it would illuminate but I think I might just get a little creative.
B00LC9ZQD4|5|I would give this 100000000 stars if possible. . I don't think Dr.Speedometer is on amazon anymore but if he is BUY THESE.  I am making a custom gauge panel with these and it looks so professional.
B000E4DF18|5|Great product.  Dropped right in.  Not only did it replace my broken headlight it is now much brighter on that side due to the shiny new reflector.  Thinking about replacing the other headlight as well since the improvement is so dramatic.
B001PWFPRU|4|Rubs a little but works great.
B0080DT93I|1|DO NOT BUY FOR 2008 AUDI A6 QUATTRO!!! These set of disc pads DO NOT FIT. I do not know who is responsible for the nomenclature (Amazon or Wagner).
B008TDXFWU|5|Nice great OEM quality. I love the look of the yellow fogs on cars and it is really great for night driving.
B001JT3DYQ|4|Was actually better quality than I was expecting. I used it for a go-box and was very happy so far.
B002797J5Q|4|Bought this to replace the stock assembly on an 84 Rabbit. Fits and works great. Quality is about what you would expect for an OEM replacement part.
B007Q8ERJY|3|these are two seperate mats not a full mat like the picture shows. Still fits and works great but i wanted to cover the hump too.
B007Y3BKNC|5|rg 4tb4tbrg  e rg
B0077YWU6Y|4|I purchased this for my 2011 Nissan Versa Hatchback, as it had no center console. It arrived quickly and very well wrapped.  A couple things - there were only 3 holes to attach the top part of the armrest to the part that inserts into the cupholder and the fit in the cup holder was a little loose, making it wobble.  I just used the three screws that had holes and that seemed secure enough. I then wrapped the part that slides into the foreward rear cupholder with a little grip shelf liner and double -stick tape that I had around the house.  Now it fits snugly, no wobble.  It looks like it came from the factory, and matches the charcoal interior perfectly.  I'm happy to have an armrest instead of bracing my arm against the passenger seat. It also provides a tiny bit of extra storage, but not much.<br />So, with a little tweaking, it's great. But don't expect a perfect outcome straight out of the box.
B00C5K3W26|3|its a good rep ... not the one i was looking for.. recommend not for 9th gen wings
B00JRHI0W2|5|This is the second one we have purchased,  one for our home and this one for our rv. I have had hip pain on other great named mattress but when I went on vacation and a pain free night and morning I asked the office what the bed was and went home and bought it and we love it so much we bought it for our rv!!*
B000BYB4NC|2|This was stated to fit my '97 F150 with a v6. It's not a direct fit, it's a universal wire set, and the connectors would have to be forced into the coil pack. I am unwilling to risk damaging the coil pack to install universal wires. I returned the wires to Amazon.
B0007VQ3PI|4|Hi, Great priced. But Box was opened on end and bars was scraped, when droped off. Did not notice scrapes till mechanic installed when I was on vacation. Took pics of damaged box and scrapes. When you need it asap what does one do. Thanks.
B006ZS291Y|5|I love the smell of this car wash! You also get plenty of suds , right down to the bottom of the bucket!😎
B002O5JKYG|1|I purchased these lights in 4300k, which is supposed to be white. I installed them and they are almost a green color, not white. I will need to purchase another set, since the green color isn't bright enough at night time. I hopefully will hear from the customer service from this company, and see if I can get a replacement set in white, if not I will purchase another set from another company.
B000C6WMB2|4|I read some good reviews about this line of brake rotors from Raybestos. Bought them on sale for my 2000 Maxima. One month of service - no problems so far.
B0002Z9M02|5|I have a 2003 ford diesel,  this product fits perfectly!  Also very easy to install.
B002Y0EOT2|5|I use it for HVAC and its great,  one side is hollow and the other magnetic.  comes with a decent case, I cut out a piece of cardboard and laid it inside the case to prevent the bits from moving around
B000QUXYXE|5|Hubby got these for his truck, arrived in a timely fashion and worked great.
B005KDOA9Y|5|I put a set of these on a 2004 Honda Odyssey two years ago and was amazed at the difference of illumination produced. The light is much whiter in color and that improves your nighttime vision tremendously. Road signs, reflective lane markings (white and yellow striping) and the reflective dots (Botts' dots) are all much brighter and can be seen from greater distances than with regular halogen headlights. Also, the beam pattern seems to be a little wider and that gives you better side vision of the shoulders of the road and the beam seems to illuminate farther down the road increasing your forward vision too. Although whiter and brighter, they don't seem to affect oncoming traffic like 'projector beam' headlights sometimes to.<br />The higher price may be a little hard to swallow but believe me, they are well worth it. Just be very careful when installing them and don't touch the glass bulbs with your fingers or let the bulbs touch anything oily or greasy. The bulbs operate at very high temperatures and any oil or grease will cause a hot spot on the glass bulb which will lead to the glass breaking. If you do accidently touch the bulb or get it dirty, don't fret, you can clean and wipe off the bulb with a clean cotton cloth or paper towel.<br />I recently traded in my Odyssey for a new 2014 Nissan Frontier and the first time of nighttime driving with OEM light bulbs and the terrible yellow tinted light made me immediately order a new set of these SilverStar zXe for my new truck.
B00BMU999A|4|Good looking, inexpensive covers.
B0031I80AA|5|Been at least 30 days and the drums aren't warped like the aftermarket drums that I replaced...I'm sold
B00GG9FJKU|5|I use it when drying my truck.  Works well when you are drying up water spots with a medium nap microfiber.  Definately leaves a glossy shine.  I find it works better with the car a bit wet.  It tends to streak a bit and needs an extra wipe or two when using on a fully dry surface.<br /><br />As economical as you could ask for.  I bought the 32oz and dillute 1:3 with distilled water.  I have 4 cars I regularly keep up with.  I think this stuff should last me at least a half year if not longer<br /><br />I also use teh Optimum Tire Shine and have been pleased with that.  Again, very effective and very economical
B000COBC7O|5|I didn't have a hundred plus dollars to replace my headliner, and I didn't have the time. So I used these Dorman Help things I found on Amazon, and they worked really good. I even placed them in a somewhat organized pattern and I think they look fine. I recommend them.
B00CS9CO6Y|5|Perfect I have a juke so I was concerned about the size and slope but we had no problems and it definitely saved room on the inside of the car
B00B0L1M3C|5|Item is delivered exactly as pictured. The only flaw I noticed was in the black finish on the inside. It was chipped off in a small oval pattern. Other than that it arrived in pristine condition. Definitely recommend this item to people looking for a pill fob / cash stash.
B0085KGOH0|5|I bought as a extra precaution for camping long weekends and only had to use once. It worked great and dumping wasn't to hard.
B0013916XW|5|QUICK SHIP-OEM PART
B000C2EFV6|5|Everything you need to change spark plug seals and valve cover gaskets on an 02 Subaru Forrester.
B0041TOQ92|5|Great price...cheap and effective!
B005HQ343W|5|These door sill guards like really sweet and sporty looking installed. These were one of a few Fiat/500 accessories that we added to our 2012 Fiat 500 when purchased.
B006PAGJXQ|4|a little lite but all in all it did the work, i was able to charge my jet ski batters with no problems
B0037WQ228|5|excelente
B004AE0DAY|4|Very close to the factory fit.  Top forward corner does not fit tight to the body like the original. But much less expensive than what the dealer wanted to charge.
B000ARPVNO|2|Used 2 bottles. Did not fix problem.
B00AGAGCRE|5|This is a great little light bar.  I hooked them into my brights using a relay and just pay attention to ensure I dim quickly for oncoming traffic or when catching up with someone.  they light up the road in front and more importantly the ditches on both sides of the road.  Very clean bright white light.  I have now bought 5 of these.  After buying 3 and installing on my wife's car, my neighbor wanted to buy two, so sold two, then bought one more.  Installed it on my car, then loaned my car to the same neighbor, who wrecked my car.  He brought it back without the light bar.  All the other broken pieces were there, but the light bar was missing.  Had to buy one more to replace it.  Used them now all winter in temperatures down to -40 without any problems.
B000CITK8S|5|I bought this to charge a car battery for a car that is driven only occasionally.  I bought one very similar to this one about two years ago (also from Battery Tender) for my father.  It worked but made a buzzing noise the whole time it was plugged in.  This new unit is totally silent and still works perfectly.  Battery Tender makes good stuff.
B0043AV4NK|5|Everything I wanted . Sounded perfect after I did a resanator delete . Would recommend to everyone that needs/wants a muffler for a decent price that sounds good . Has a very deep sound like I wanted .
B00GUF74HQ|4|this thing was a giant pain in the ass to install because the &#34;tool&#34; they give you for inserting the tailgate component would not work, at all.  So the &#34;9&#34; or &#34;10&#34; turns or whatever it was went out the window when I had to improvise to make it work right.  Took me almost two hours to install that one lousy piece...because it did not work as easily and magically as they said I had to move slow for fear of screwing it up and also screwing up my tailgate.<br /><br />With that said, now that its installed, it works like a dream.
B00AXAO71K|5|Holds alot. Zippers work well. It has a great design. Reflective straps and tie downs work well. I would recommend this product.
B00407V5B2|4|Fixed my son's Scion mirrors with this and also the lower stone guard. Color was a good match. Drys fast and when I put the clear coat on top it looked great.
B00062ZSCC|5|i have used this filters on all our family vehicles.they never fail easy cleaning and refills good as new the engine never gasp for air because the flow is very efficient.
B001THQP84|5|I use these to hang my party lights around my 10'x10' canopy and they are perfect! Don't look anywhere else to hang your lights!
B001JBD34O|5|I should have bought a second one! Came quick!
B004NPMAD8|3|Ok, first of all I receive shipments from Amazon 2-3X a week.  I buy quite a bit for home and shop use.  I figured I would try the Texas Tea oil I saw here for some of my kids cars to save them some money.  I have 9 other cars/hot rods and I run Royal Purple in all of them.  I received a 6-pack case of Texas Tea today as well as a 12-pack case of Royal Purple, both by UPS my same regular driver.  RP arrived as normal in great shape.  The Texas Tea arrived with no damage to outer box but when I opened it, the TT packaging was saturated with Oil.  One of the bottles was slightly loose enough to spill out during shipment.  Maybe a fluke but not a first good experiance.  As for the quality, I will write a review later on that after I do some simple testing.  I am not an Engineer but I plan on during some basic tests.  I have a 2002 Chevy 2500HD that I alway run RP and initially I did some basic heat tests comparing the exhaust manifold temps running regular brand X full synthetic. I saw a drop in Exhaust manifold temps in the 25-30 degree F.  Lower temps mean less friction resulting in less wear on your engine internals.  I'm due for an oil change so I am curious to see what happens when I swap to the Texas Tea.<br /><br />So yes the price is great on Texas Tea but Engine Rebuilds cost a lot more so I will see the results after some basic tests.  I also emailed Texas Tea Oil today to get some comparison data sheets on TT versus RP and others.  Let's see what they come back with.
B000CQSKV8|5|Great for the price
B00389O50G|5|Simple & Quick RE-Usable Wire Connectors. Xlnt product. Wish more retailers carried this item in stock. Easy to use and can even reuse them. I will not want to be without any in my tool box.
B000VU9D20|5|i used two of these to replace a 16 gang fuse block in my 79 lincoln mark V, everything works like its supposed to.
B00D329UYO|4|Good heavy quality,but the back mat won't fit my car<br />(2013 Chrysler 300).
B00S1KHJ96|5|Very, very pleased!
B004R900GO|3|The engine stand seems well built but had to modify front cross leg so stand would fit between legs of engine hoist
B000BN3TF4|5|I ordered this rug on tuesday and recieved it by ten oclock next day, WOW!!! Outstanding service amazon. Minor adjustments twenty minutes later it looks like it was factory installed. Easy peasy install. It feels nice, look s better , very satisfied with product. Great price., free shipping, christmas  without the fat  guy.
B004QQH1JC|5|Great replacement parts got it with in a day after ordering
B00HZBR4JM|1|The stickers I received were cut offset. This left an white edge on the whole right hand side on all of the roundel.
B006JRQEYY|5|They are great. A must have for any truck. Very easy to install. Should have purchased them when I bought the truck.
B00AA1J0GE|4|I bought this as a xmas gift for the wife. I like the idea of not having to use a seperate remote to start the car. Istall was fairly easy. I do have one problem with it, it starts the car every 4 hours no matter how many times i reset it. I've turned off that feature but it still starts the car evry 4 hours, thats the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
B000CB6ADS|5|2006 Honda Element - 6mm Fit the front wipers, using the original Honda blade assemblies, on my vehicle perfectly with two sections snapped off.  These are a good alternative to wasting money replacing the entire blade assembly every 6 months.  Thank you TRICO for giving me a money saving option - - $6.99 +tax, per pair, at AutoZone.
B004303ZGY|5|Thise mats made my new lanai. It looks like an elegant outdoor room I enjoy using. I added the fabric screens for bug control and am so comfortable.
B000EAIERW|5|these seem to be very well made, I missed the word (pair) so I ordered four, it would have been nice in the caption if they had said grab handles, no biggie, I know enough people with jeeps.
B00BEJOV4W|5|great deal
B0009JKI8G|5|Good.
B00GMPM3RK|5|GOOD FAST DEL NO PROBLEM
B005G87LTO|5|Was great fit perfect in in my car
B000W8DLEC|5|This thing blows... hard!  :)
B00BVB5HFA|4|Thanks
B0087PAKE6|4|Nice Lock pin.  very quick shipping.
B000HDJLSW|3|The basket arrived more quickly than I anticipated,  which is a big plus but there were three things that tarnished this product for me:<br /><br />First, the tubes were bent where they connect. I thought about sending it back defective, but opted to try to straighten them out by smacking it with a rubber mallet. Thankfully, it worked.<br /><br />Second, the instructions said to put the basket on the roof rack and snap the saddles into place. Easier said than done, unfortunately. I had to take the roof rack down, flip it over, and hit the saddles into place with the rubber mallet too.<br /><br />Lastly, the knobs that are supposed to tighten on the u-bolts were nearly impossible to tighten.  They almost didn't seem to be threaded. Eventually, I grabbed a pair of pliers and they ate up a few of the knobs, but I just could not tighten these by hand anymore. I enlisted some help and they had the brilliant idea to use a socket wrench. Once we found one big enough, it worked like a charm. I can already feel that I'm probably going to end up with at least one blister.<br /><br />All in all this took about an hour and a half to do.<br /><br />It seems to be a good basket. I haven't used it yet but it appears sturdy. Other than the excessive labor to put it together (not to mention it got all scratched up while I was doing this) I'm happy with it.
B001PIAYU2|3|ok but go another step up to delete the emissions and spend the 749.00 to save fuel i had this on my 2008 powerstroke was ok performance wise but not enough features for the price go to the better one that has emisions delete youll be glad at the pump you did
B002ZIAWYY|4|Claims to be the lowest profile \\"DOT\\" helmet on market... but it still looks like a mushroom sitting on my head.  It's apparently good quality, but not what I was expecting.
B000C55MQK|5|Significantly improved ride, load capacity, and overall road handling for the cost of a pair of shocks.
B00A9ODEJ6|5|Perfect fit. Easy install
B000EBICHI|1|Awful!  Doesn't stay in place (the latches aren't efficient).  Once I manually put it into place it's fine, but annoying.  I would have spent the money on something sturdier.
B0009N4F7C|5|My car didn't come with any cupholders so this product is a great way to get around that. It clips right into the vents. I got one for each side of the car (driver and passenger). It holds most size cups except really large ones (snapple bottles dont fit though). They stay on good, and you can use the heat and A/C to keep the desired temp of the drink. I would highly recommend it
B00BFDJ72S|5|I bought it for my Honda 1999 CR-V but it was not the same style. But it worked perfectly with my dad's 2003 Cr-V
B00MMZ0H7C|5|It fit and works well
B00192JFI6|5|Works well
B0045WBVUM|3|Mounted to the stock seat on my Harley Heritage Classic.  The pads literature claims &#34;up to 6-hours of riding&#34;. Although this pad does provide more comfort for longer trips, after about 3 hours of riding I still get a little monkey butt.  I've tried more air, less air, medium air - all to no avail.  I weight 193 pounds at 6'1&#34; and do have a little natural cushion in the seat.  Better than the stock seat alone, but not as advertised.
B000AMBOFS|3|Gets ok.
B005F64SR0|5|Works well way more accurate that's a stick guage.
B00J26DDR0|1|The shipping was fast however, the product is poorly made and the painted insignia came horribly faded out of the box. Severely disappointed in this product!!!
B004A7S4DY|5|does what its supposed to do got it really fast
B0036GNSGS|4|I had this on my motorcycle for last 1 month and it works perfectly. Locking it is bit tricky but you will get used to it.
B0083KQNBO|1|I figured a cable is a cable, what could go wrong.  Well..<br /><br />I was approached at the airport parking lot by a guy needing a jump.  I jumped at the opportunity to use my new jumper cable set (never used it, still in the case).  After about 20 minutes of no success I realized I had my multimeter with me.  14.5 volts on my end, about 7 volts on his end with his battery connected (0 volts with is batter not connected).  So, thats a 14.5 volt drop!  He got a shuttle bus to stop and give him a jump.  Worked right away.<br /><br />Moral:  When you get your jumper cable, test it before you need it!!  Just measure the voltage at the end to make sure it works.  If it doesn't, send it back, if it does, keep it.
B0001EXR1O|2|Be ready to work!!!  This hood shield is not a no tool installation item as stated.  I've NEVER seen such a piece of garbage install kit with anything I've ever installed.  I finally ended up installing it with very short self tapping screws.
B00AE27RN2|4|These were exact replacements for my bumper clips on an 06 TL.  Cheap and work perfect, what else is there?  I'm glad I have a stock if these since every time I need to take a few clips off I break at least a few of them.
B00KWGSKA4|5|Inexpensive, fit, black, arrived quick... Perfect!
B004XEKJUK|4|Pretty good. strong. looks real nice. its made to wear around your neck so if you hang from your chain like i do only one side will say honda. while the other side is inside but nbd.
B00CIC43BU|5|No more beeping noise. Good price
B001DC1VRK|5|I ALWAYS receive what I purchase from amazon on time, or early.  This product had the dimensions on the amazon listing, so I knew it would fit my 4runner.  It is a great product that I can reuse and, though this may be without a huge knowledge base, I feel as though my truck runs better with this filter.
B00DIKCM6E|5|Easy to install (about 2 minutes) to replace the ones that broke on my 2006 mitsu eclipse
B000EQR87S|5|Easy replacement and actually locks into place unlike my old cap. Simply pull the wire connection apart to remove the old fuel cap, and push the new pin into place. Simple. Couldn't ask for more with this product.
B005V2SJZ0|2|This was cited to fit 2013 500c; it does not.  Holes do not line up.  Unfortunately, had totally unpacked it and thrown away boxes before I figured this out.  It is the holes above the tire that are incorrect.  I finally fixed this by inserting one bolt that lined up.  Then cut two steel straps 5&#34; x 1.5&#34;, drilled holes, and put them into threaded holes in car frame.  The steel straps overlapped the bracket to raise the tire, and they appear to be working well keeping the tire firmly in place.  I am not happy with the solution, but felt trapped after I had removed the packing materials.
B0079GQKDE|5|It's a great tool had to modify it for the Ford F-450 and 550 Super Duty Trucks but after that it works great.
B00OPMIR2M|4|Well built, quality tire gauge. Comfortable handle, bright l.e.d. tip light. The only thing I would suggest is that NorthONE develop a model with a slightly narrower tip/head at an approximate 90 degree angle which would be better suited for use on motorcycle tires,
B00GNTZE76|4|Not as bright as i wanted but still worked
B00B8X2DN0|4|Easy to pop into place, makes interior look nicer
B007EHOWNI|5|Does the job.
B004J6N5CG|1|Pathetic!!!
B007AHH7CK|4|I like Kuryakyn products a lot, and have quite a few of them. Most of the time, they're an exact fit. The Phase 7 LED Headlamp isn't quite one of those times. The Phase 7 is built very well, with a solid plastic shell and thick clear lens, and it seems like it will be very durable. It's certainly bright and clear, much more light than my stock headlight. The not-so-exact fit came when I put my headlight mounting/adjusting rings together around the new headlight...the blocks on the shell don't quite line up with the notches in the rings, and the rim of the shell is 1/8&#34; to 3/16&#34; thicker than the stock, so the &#34;outer&#34; chrome trim ring has to be pushed and squeezed a bit to get the screws holding things together to line up, and it doesn't tighten down completely. It still fits within the headlight nacelle's outer fascia ring though, and still goes back together cleanly and adjusts properly, so it's not a detriment to function. The other issue is that most folks will want to use a zip-tie to bundle up the 6&#34; connector wire lead that comes with the Phase 7 as opposed to the direct connection on back of the stock headlight.<br />One more note: replacing just the bulb only requires releasing a bracket at the back of the stock headlight shell. Replacing the entire headlamp requires full dis-assembly and re-assembly of the headlight mounting and adjusting mechanisms. It takes about 30-45 minutes unless you've done it a lot, and the adjustment springs and their nylon blocks can get lost easily if you're not careful. Kuryakyn apparently assumes you have the mechanical know-how to do this, and maybe a shop manual for your bike, because they include no instructions. Give yourself time, have a clean, clear workbench with a soft cloth to protect fragile finishes, and think it through and you'll be fine.
B002SE1G9U|5|These window shades are made to look sleek on the vehicle, not stick out. They are easy to put on and give the truck a sharp look. They come with a thin film on the outside of the shades to protect them in transit that you have to remove before placing them on your vehicle. They provide just enough air during the rain and it makes me feel more comfortable leaving the windows vented when it's hot outside. Fits perfect on a 2012 Ford F-150 Super Crew Cab.
B0053ZK8RW|5|Love my Anaheim Ducks and my stickers 👍🏻🚨🐤😁
B0068ERU9Q|5|good cheep fit well will see how they hold up
B000CFSF14|5|Love the sound.  installation was a breeze.  Definitely a little better throttle response.  Most of all, Free 2 day shipping with Prime.. to HAWAII!!
B00DP89L04|5|appears to be a well made cover. Fit's my 2015 RTL like a glove.
B00BZFZH0W|5|Durable product. Easy to install and use.  Lockable feature is nice. Both sides lock.  Used on my 2008 Saturn VUE.  Center on car racks.  Pop out the ends (when unlocked) turn clockwise to tighten gripper that sits around the luggage racks on car and you are good to go.  Used with a soft top car carrier that fit in between and tied off on cross bars.  Good product!
B000E4RC3K|5|My mechanic offered to order this for me and said it would run me about $60. I browsed online through various car parts websites until I decided to look for this item on Amazon. The price was unbeatable, the shipment arrived quickly and the product was exactly what my car needed, so I am one happy person!
B002E54VSG|5|Easy to install work GREAT. GREAT PRICE  THANKS
B000CMHVBC|1|I bought this thinking i could save time and effort in the mornings this winter... while test fitting it i noticed that because they put the straps to secure it at the bottom with NOTHING to secure it at the top even the slightest hint of wind will fold the top of it down and open your windshield to the snow and ice you intended on avoiding<br /><br />attemping to flip it the other way just would not work...<br /><br />had they put some straps at the top as well (or even just the top and let the bottom be tucked under your wiper blades... or even some weights in the bottom) this would have been just fine<br /><br />cons: designed by a monkey on crack<br /><br />pros: easily folds up compactly so you can put it back in the box and return it
B00JEGXVL6|5|Love this antenna!!!! Great reception too!
B005XQG3VG|5|I wish I would have ordered this sooner instead of trying to glue my mirror together.  It was affordable and easy to install.
B002KJW6OC|2|Good product for the money, but would not work my car
B0052SF0LO|4|We have a feed shack outside of our horse pasture in Alaska (58 degrees north). This time of year we only get 2  hours or so of sun above the horizon at our location and at that it is low on the horizon. we use the LED solar motion light t provide light inside the shed while mixing and weighing feed, or restocking the shed. it gets a total use of an hour twice a day. So far it has worked very well even after a few cloudy, rainy, or snowy days in a row. I would recommend it to friends. the only negative is the sensitivity adjustment is difficult. a wave of the arm turns it back on so that is not a deal breaker.<br />Now just to figure out a way to keep the water from freezing.
B00RVUGJES|4|They came on time and they look great on my Challenger.
B00C7FO78C|5|Nice  colors and stitching
B000N2XOHQ|5|Easy to install.  Granted, I looked at a few videos (on You-know-what-Tube) so it was not completely new to me.  Took my time and the car cranked right up, nice and smooth.  Great upgrade.  Car:  bone stock (okay, technically not anymore) 1973 Mach 1 with 302 and factory distributor.
B002HSX7P8|5|Took my 1998 VW beetle to the garage,  they charged me $88 to read the code then another $750 to do some repair work.  Two weeks later the engine light came back on.  This little reader and an internet search showed that the code is intermittent on these cars.  Clearing it got it through the CA smog check and it hasn't come back on since.    Also,  the CA smog check caused the ABS light to come on (front wheels rolling,  back wheels not) and the reader was able to identify that and clear the code for me turning the light off (and that one hasn't come back either).    Simple to use,  works well.
B00199BO4C|5|Install was way too easy. Big upgrade from stock coil on my 62 Falcon 170 cu. in. Runs great! Hotter spark so I think I can open up the gap on my plugs.
B008R5LHM0|5|Works very well! I use it for my scanner and it works very good!
B0002JMUZC|1|Filter in box not in plastic bag or inlet outlet caps  for debris prevention injection systems do not like dirt.
B005S5DDGK|3|The product is fine. But the instruction is not clear enough. I need go you tube to learn to install it. Maybe my electronic knowledge is not good to install it with simple instruction.
B0030VH6M6|5|I have a 1997 Jeep Wrangler Sport and these fit perfectly into my new fuel tank skid place that I ordered from Amazon.
B0053VIJAE|5|Great
B0073RYG1W|3|The hole for securing it in the trailer hitch is drilled to far back for the light to fit snuggly thus allowing it to wobble/shake.
B000CHT88Q|1|dont waste your money on this book . it expain nothing in this book . very poor book for mazda trucks .
B00DRK81AQ|5|Works as advertised
B000CM5CIQ|5|This fits Perfectly! (I have a 1997 Pontiac Sunfire).  I would recommend that you break out your other mirror first though (my dad did not for mine, but it looks okay, you can just tell there is a mirror behind it). Other than that, its a perfect fit, and it was worth the money!
B003I43Y44|5|You can never have enough pivots for you helmets I keep a set on my bike ever since lifting my visor on the freeway and snapping my left side pivot and had to ride 200 miles home with my visor off.
B00E3J2FQG|5|Literally the day I put this sticker on my truck, I rolled it. but i liked it and ordered it again
B00RUDWVWA|5|perfect fit and look
B000EQ0O9M|4|Its the second set of these pads that I have installed for my Nissan Pathfinder. They work well with very low dust. I prefer them over OEMs.
B000COC0RK|5|NEVER dissapointed in K & M.
B004AII79E|2|Did not work for my application
B000MS9VZK|5|You get what you pay for. Best battery for my truck. 2003 Tacoma, bought it new in 2002.
B007JSGR9Y|1|Won't read my '05 Freestar.  Took vehicle to two different Autozones, both read with no problems.<br /><br />Inferior product.  I feel as if my money has been stolen.
B001B0X00U|5|This is a great Plug.  Once you install this you will notice a difference right away with starts and idle. Best thing about this plug is that this will probably be the last plug you need. Spend the extra $$ and get this over stock. Using this on my Kymco B&W 250 (2004).
B00189BHA4|5|So light and easy to install, why did I not buy this sooner?  This top is very well made, heavy duty mesh.  Drive with the confidence that the seagulls can not bomb you with a bikini mesh top overhead!
B001AM8Q26|4|Everithing was ok, Shipping great on time!!
B00D950HO2|4|This product is no joke. It is well made, and very sturdy. The welds and bends are top notch. I would recommend this product for sure
B005GGLUXO|4|I really like the mats. They look great in my tundra. I have spilled food, drink and sand and it all cleaned up nice and quick, I did have to use water for the sand. These mats go well into the plastic lining around the floor, If possible match the color to the plastic lining of your truck not to the color of the carpet it will look much better.
B00ABZCETY|5|What a great product I really liked the looks of these extenders and I was not disappointed  when I received them they matched the snaps on my vest perfectly
B000M3V95U|5|This product is amazing. I also tried Windex on my car window and this product is way better. It makes the glass so clear that you can easily forget that the glass is there at all. I does dry without streaks. I would buy again when my bottle runs out, but one bottle should last a long time.
B00DWE4QWO|5|Straight forward installation, love the addition of auto headlights. Works great without expensive dealer programming.
B000C2GE6K|4|Good easy to use gasket.
B006QLLKAG|5|Good Product it fitted correctly in my 2012 Ford Escape.
B002308E9O|5|Another tool that you can't do without, but use for 2 minutes!<br /><br />High quality.
B005MZV26O|5|Perfect for the animal lover in you.
B001AVS8S4|5|Fit my 2003 SV650s perfectly. Went with this and a 47T rear sprocket for a little more pull and im never going back.
B004A130X4|5|Came earlier than expected very good
B001O0AMZS|5|Great Lug nuts, once i got the right size. . . . . . . . . . . .
B004BE621C|4|Product works great, my only complaint is the plug to change from brake to axc is difficult to get back in because the wires are so stiff.
B002KQA8EK|5|works good, need better description for size matching to wheel size
B00V2ZG9PW|5|Look super cool on my intruder, very nice and original design and super fast shipping
B000BO6O96|5|Works Great
B00FXHU0AA|5|I bought this at over $300 off of dealership cost. What also sold it for me is it has a 6 month warranty.
B006Y7D35W|5|Very nice I jujst waiting for put in place and have fun...
B000LV7XR6|5|We have the 26\\" on one vehicle and the 22\\" on another and they are all superior to any other blade we have used. They are quiet, even with a dry or almost dry windshield and clear the windshield in the heaviest downpour. They don't lift or streak in heavy crosswinds or at highway speeds. We do not yet have long term service with these blades but we have had a set in use for a year, they still preform like new. (We keep the cars in the garage when not in use, which probably helps.)<br /><br />Delivery was reasonably quick and the price was reasonable. Occasionally Amazon puts these blades on sale with exceptionally good pricing and free delivery!
B00HHG910A|5|This Key Finder has saved my skin a number of times. I bought in late May, but wanted to use it a while before wrote a review.      I lose things a lot, multi-tasking, walking from room to room, \\"delivering\\"  things. When I am ready to leave the house and my keys aren't on their hook by the door, I used to go into panic mode, franticly looking for them. It is so GOOD to calmly walk over to the hook where the key finder is, press the button, and hear the \\"beep\\". It saves so much time!      My second is attached to the top of my iPad cover. That's another object that I walk around with. The only thing I have to remember is not to put it behind my purse because the beam won't travel through it. When you need your iPad, you need it NOW.    So far I haven't lost the finder. If I do, I will do something like Greg did. Thank you, Greg for the idea!    Stephanie
B007BJ79X4|5|fits really easy
B007G9ICOO|4|Product was as described, great improvement over the factory headlights.
B0015554KU|2|At close range with a flashlight you can see small reflective pattern areas under the red caps but at night - shining a variety of lights at them from various distances and angles - these fasteners present a dark circular silhouette - there was nothing reflective about them.
B000JQWZ12|5|This seemed to work great!  Purchased for our trip to Hawaii and these bands definately serve there purpose.  I get motion sickness easily and we took a 5 hour boat ride with some pretty crazy waves and I was totally fine from beginning to end... it was great!
B003SZUT6E|3|Grill just seem like its something I couldve made with some wire
B00D61EZVA|5|good
B00BTGSGFK|5|Use these for all my waxes and sealants.
B002ZTGLV6|1|I purchased this unit over the others because it was the only one fairly priced with a complete steel tube frame and a shell cover that had good visibility up front. Finding the correct mounting method for my snow thrower took a little time, but that was expected considering this is a universal cab so I was not upset by that.   The problems with this product are:  -The powder coating on the steel tube frame is extremely poor and scrapes off while connecting the steel tube frame together.  -The unit did not assemble correctly. Each pipe of the frame is labeled so you know how to assemble them together correctly (since the manual was completely useless). What you can't see in their example picture is that the top four pipes (L shaped - one from each corner) are supposed to all connect in the middle together with one bolt. The issue that I faced with this is that none of the pipes when pulled into the center were even close to the same height. I double and triple checked the assembly of the cab to make sure I didn't goof along the way somewhere, but everything was correct. So the only way I was able to make it \\"work\\" was to just bend the life out of each pipe until I could make all of the pipes, more or less, meet at the same height so the holes would line up enough to force the bolt through to hold them together.   The good things about this product are:  -The cab can be quickly detached  -The cab shell seemed to be of fair quality and has good visibility.  -The steel tubes so far seem strong.  My Conclusion:  Instead of dealing with the hassle and cost of returning this item, I plan on rebuilding the upper half of the frame with my own design - they way I thought/expected this unit to have came.  I absolutely do NOT recommend this product to anyone.
B000GUYK3M|5|like the title says  this piece was a perfect fit , the finish was flawless ,shims were supplied along with it.
B0048J01RG|5|Good stuff...FAST!
B003CEODQI|5|Works great holding up my High lift on my FJ cruiser roof rack.
B003V4YUN0|1|Bought the Rain-X brand bracketless wiper blades last year.  At first they were fantastic just like cheaper blades when they are new, but the quality of wipe deteriorated within a month or two.  I live in California where there is no snow, so I dont't know if these work better in snow, but for rain I will buy the cheapest name-brand alternative this season.
B001QUI5K0|2|The part is cheaply built. The motor side plastic fan was not flat, and the extra wobble required that I bend the frame a bit so that it wouldn't rub the middle support in front of the fan.
B006WQSD1O|4|So far no problems.  I've read some forums where people said they had to replace them after 4 years.  I won't have this car in 4 years so that isn't going to be an issue.  Big O where I bring my car for service wanted $249 for the part.  Auto Zone wanted $89.  I didn't even pay half that.  Good deal.
B00EPPMRQG|5|It is very well made, single piece of metal with bent ends, and what looks like machined teeth.<br />Fits nicely on my grizzly G0519 mill.
B005909KWA|5|I used these tools to put an AUX cable in my car. Audio DIY is not something I have ever done or plan to do more of, so I didn't want to spend a lot of money on these types of tools. They worked great. Definitely recommend them.
B00032K4FG|1|Arrived with a crack in the plastic screen. Very frustrating.
B001GN2C1K|5|Easy to install.  Just plug it in and you are good to go.
B00S77RO7A|5|Fit perfectly and easy to install.
B007X0UG0Y|5|Excellent
B005DUMX16|4|So far so good.
B000BNZPT2|5|Fast, easy install.  Looks factory.
B000FW61SI|1|The plastic is not of acceptable optical quality. View through it is distorted to the point that I don't use it.
B00GLQBDVM|4|Didn't fit my car but they are nice pedals
B00L4DDUL8|1|Not what advertised. Lousy design and quality.
B00FV1MMGS|1|ehh,, it is okay.when I first got it  I was extremely aggravated. plastic edge is rough, but what i hate the most is the picture doesn't show that they put on the front vent visors a huge AVS in white paint. Which totally distracts you from the sleek smoke black appearance. and you have to look at it every time you open the door update.,,,, I was able to remove the crappy looking logo/text on the vent visor by using nail polish remover. I don't use nail polish so I had to spend an additional 4 dollars to remove it. Now it looks much MUCH better.  HOWEVER. it is very thin and flimsy. I wish I had bought the oem version first.The oem shade is MUCH much sturdier and worth the extra money. You get what you pay for, and in this case you get less.
B000CIV6CG|4|Just like any exhaust kit it took some work to get everything together and once it was done I wasn't really happy with the placement of the outlets but the sound is nice and quiet. As far as the fitment goes you really do get what you pay for.
B00DZ3AQJY|5|Love it!
B0052XJ6IW|5|This switch was identical to the factory one. It was cheaper than anywhere else and it was the same thing! One screw and a wire, that was it!
B000P7O5DG|5|As described, works great. Gets the job done.
B0045L8I5Y|5|love it thanks
B009EJRBZ0|4|This thing is about the size of a regular water bottle, comes in a case with hose and added fittings.  Just note this is not a heavy duty inflator, and used best for top off or emergencies.  Fits behind seat of my pickup without taking up a lot of space, so for me it works for purposes described.
B00AQUUYV4|3|Looks good. Very good construction. No mounting hardware at all not even bolts. Very dim
B000X90YUO|5|This unit really pumps the tires quickly! I wish the airhose was just a smidgen longer; it's a little difficult to reach the rear wheel on the opposite side of the battery.
B003YM8YMM|4|This is really a useful bit of additional storage. As a matter of fact the zippered storage was far larger than I expected - while the pouch for sunglasses is far smaller than I expected.<br />With the top down, the pouch pokes up above the roll bar - not a big deal, but something to consider.<br />Nice to have the additional storage right above my head
B008PPN93W|3|Love eTrack, but I specifically bought the black painted stuff to match my brand new trailer. The eTrack wasn't outside for even 24 hours before the gloss of the paint was lost, and the black turned into more of a dark gray. Cheap paint is used, and chips off easily.
B000JZSPBM|5|This is an awesome product. It was everything I hoped for. i BOUGHT 2 OF THEM AND THEY ARE AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN OEM.
B00BH4G2AK|5|I used this on my external DVD drive for my MAC and I absolutely love it.  It is very cute and is easy to apply.
B0006JLW84|5|Good quality Camco White Polypropylene vent lid.  Replaced original one on our trailer.  Was very easy to install.  Seems to be lasting fine...
B000MY1RB0|5|Turned titanium wrap into silver...cant even tell it was titanium
B008XN7NUG|5|I'd give 5 stars for this product. It works perfect. I buy it then sent it to my brother in Iraq. I totally recommend this product.
B0002UEMZ2|5|I bought this to keep the bolt, that holds my hockey skate blades, from coming loose during games. It is working perfectly. I never have to worry about them anymore. And when I want to replace the blades it takes a little more effort to break the seal, but it is easily manageable. I wish the auto manufactures would use this when they assemble the dashboards. It would eliminate a lot of buzzing and rattling.
B001FEVKA4|4|great
B00HZSLEMI|3|Do these power fold in?
B006FUT0CS|4|I like it. Works well and is fairly priced.
B00AY23T5W|5|Makes my bmw look almost new
B005R3SSMW|5|If you have a Prius and don't want to spend $70 on an oil change, then order this and go to Walmart to get the jug of 0-20W oil at a huge savings.  I did the change without this tool once...just once
B001TCXQAY|5|Great tool for second thermodynamic law research.
B00U3DJ5NM|5|large Alien flashing the LLAP sign!  I love it!!
B001NQQ9WI|5|It's only job is to stick and it did.
B0007RDVE8|5|My dad works for a car restoration body shop and he loves Mothers products.  He recommended them to me after I bought my new car this year, so I loaded up on their products to see what I thought.  I really do love the shine that this wax gives my car and it works really well in conjuction with the gold showtime instant detailer.  I purchased the Mothers yellow Microcfiber applicator pads to help to apply this to my car.  It goes on easy and comes off really well leaving a streak free finish!
B00EPVKJU6|1|This set is horrible. The ballast are light and cheap, one of them had a dent in the center and wouldn't stay on more than 30 seconds. The light output is also horrible and they are extremely blue. Don't waste you money on these.
B007ICURP6|5|shipping was a pain the first time but then after talking to Amazon I got a replacment shipped next day. They sound great on my GT500 matched up with a BBK xpipe.
B004W97G8O|5|I must have been a lucky one, they were a direct Plug-and-play with no modifications required on my 2001 mitsubishi eclipse spyder gt.<br />I love them over the stock ones but one thing that many would have not noticed is that they have a outer ring on the tail lights that looks a bit silver for some but its just the glass.<br />I love them and I love how they look with the plastidip job I did on my car.<br /><br />best thing is that they are legal and look amazing!
B000VKRQBA|1|This was ordered for a 2010 Sienna. The Amazon app said it would fit a 2010 Sienna. It did not fit a 2010 Sienna. The sheet it came with said it was made for a 2012 or later Sienna. On the bright side, Amazon paid to ship it back, then refunded my money.
B0016I8E1M|5|This carrier is very nice.  It assembled in a few minutes and fits nicely in the 2\\" hitch.  you need you own hitch pin as this did nto come with one.  Just use the one you have with you ball.  But if you don't have one, keep that in mind.<br /><br />The thing weighs a lot and this is pro and a con.  It takes a little effort to put 75lbs in the receiver and to get the pin in.  I did it by myself, but having a second person would make the task easier.  But once on the weight keeps the carrier from moving and of course makes this a strong rack.  The rack can hold 600lbs,  but you need to keep in mind ht etonge weight of the vehicle and the hitch.  In my case that is 400lbs so I once I duduct the weight of the rack, that leaves me with 325 lbs capacity.  That still is pleanty.<br /><br />The light kit is a great addition.  The picture shows it, but it is not included.  Well worth it IMO to avoid a rear end collision.<br /><br />The unit could have been packed better and had a small scratch on it.  But, a little touch up and I was good to go.  It will get scratched up anyway.<br /><br />In short this rack it tough and capable.  I'm very happy with it.
B00C4B18JU|5|Excellent item - perfect direct fit for our Lexus.  Takes a bit of time and you need the RIGHT TOOLS before you start.  Read the instruction a couple of times before you start.  2 people is really a requirement.
B000CO86BY|1|Great Product, and Great Price.
B0083CJAOO|5|Love it! It's super bright<br />An is perfect for my company
B0040MM0TI|4|Pretty good product no problems at all sucks that there is no instructions but that's in the description. Overall very satisfied with purchase.
B00PGH5UZC|5|Great item at a reasonable price.  A perfect fit for my CX-5 keyless fob.  Nice leather and several different attachment options.  Fast delivery.
B0027IAQ3O|5|Perfect fit. Quality product.
B000R8F47Y|5|Works great. TIP: Take the hooks off to avoid a timely untangling.<br /><br />Fit great and love the ability to resize via moving the hooks as needed.<br /><br />2013 GMC Denali.
B005G3LA2I|5|These were surprisingly brighter than I suspected. Never hurts to be more visible.<br />Your group will appreciate it when there's a lot of snow dust.
B0051V459K|5|Long lasting break pads with low-to none noise and dust.
B002R0O7PU|5|Looked and fit like the original.
B000C560CA|5|Easy on and off great product
B005ASY23I|4|Great product fast and easy to use.
B008LXPWA6|5|My son loves them when he rides his 4 wheeler.
B0012TWSSA|5|I used this for crafting, and it worked beyond my wildest dreams. I honestly thought I would get overheated but when I put this on to test the fit, I got cold! It was awesome! I knew then I had made the right choice.
B000C53RG2|5|Bought these to replace the front OEM shocks at 70K miles.  They are extremely comparable to OEM in feel and control.  There are probably better shocks out there but for the price, these are hard to beat.  I have read of quality issues with Monroe shocks but have had none thus far myself.  Granted, I have only put 6-7K miles on these shocks.  I could use a set for the rear too and I am seriously considering these.
B001KSE0XO|2|BEWARE!!!! This glass does not fit into the groove. It's about an eigth of an inch too big. If you buy it, DO NOT remove the old glass. This glass fits over it.
B0002KM5L0|5|This tool is simply awesome.  I have done the Pump-N-Bleed thing for years, and hated that.  I moved on to the Miti-Vac which has done me well for years, but would end up with a lot of wasted fluid chasing bubbles out of the lines because of imperfect seals on the bleeder valves.  Not to mention the pain in the butt of having to go back and forth to re-fill the reservoir then back to bleeding.  Not that big of a deal, but time consuming.<br />Now, the Power Bleeder.  It took me a few minutes to get going with it but use it once and it is brain-less.  I have multiple vehicles so I needed multiple adapters.  I used air tool couplings (quick disconnects) for a couple of reasons.  First, it allowed me to swap adapters easily with good seals and not lose fluid all over the engine compartment.  Second, it allowed me to get a good seal screwing the cap onto the master cylinder reservoir without the PVC hose twisting up.  I did what every guy will do (not read the instructions) and ended up not getting a perfect seal the first time and lost some fluid.  Should have placed a rag under the master cylinder.<br />Others have stated that they only used the bleeder to pressurize the system and didn't put fluid in the container.  I put the fluid in the container.  This made the bleeding very easy.  I pumped up the container's hand pump to 15 psi which allowed me to complete the whole job only having to re-pressurizing the container one time.  I also used the Genesis Magnetic Bleeder bottle.<br />I strongly recommend this tool to anyone who does their own work on their car.  It is well constructed and should stand up to frequent use.
B001UO6ET6|5|I used this on my late model sedan and it's awesome. Together with the polish, one application will last 6-12 months on my car. I garage my car and don't drive it frequently. I get positive comments on it a lot. This may seem like an expensive product, but it will last a long time if you follow the directions.
B000C2CH4I|5|Didn't need everything in kit but what I did use worked awesome on my 95 YJ.
B00G5RTYYK|1|I just got this in the mail today, had to go out of my way to pick it up from the post office.. and I'm extremely disappointed and planning to demand a refund as soon as I'm done with this review.  I opened the package to find a single 8 1/2 by 11 inch piece of paper with strips of slightly circular tape spanning the page's 8 1/2 inch side from top to bottom.  I have not even attempted to put this tape on my tires yet because there is no possible way whatsoever there is going to be enough to cover both of the rims on my motorcycle.  At most, I estimate there MIGHT be enough tape here to cover one side of one tire.  And it's nothing but colored vinyl, it looks cheap and gimmicky.  There's no way in hell I'm putting this stuff on my bike.. but then again I didn't get enough of it to do so if I wanted to!
B00EP3PW4M|5|Fast shiping and a perfect fit.
B00GS9LI5I|4|I love the look of my new tire cover. It is a bit expensive, but definitely worth it. As others have stated in reviews, it did come with a few paint scratches on it. I wish they would have given the cover a few coats of paint, as it seems to only have one. I would recommend this company to a friend, just wish the cover had a thinker coat of paint.
B000F5ECRM|3|Tool does exactly as advertized but crankshaft really doesn't need held the only way it can be turned or moved is by hand.
B006E0PEDI|5|nice got them quick nice quality would buy again.
B004SET8D4|5|The hub arrived on time and fits well,  Thank you!
B007T4EY66|5|It was a little hard to fit on my crf250l but it fits with no trimming and looks great
B004LWVEKS|5|This is one of the best battery chargers I've bought, and don't think I'll ever need to look anywhere else for  a charger again. Not only does it produce some great, quality charge which helps return batteries to their  maximum capacity, but it does it quickly too. In terms of pricing, I would be happy to pay more for a charger  of this quality.
B004804NWE|5|Toughest hose I have seen yet.  If you use it properly dumping is a breeze and is a clean operation.  I always drain the grey water last in order to flush out the hose.  Just a lil tip.
B003ZS3290|5|1. Can not beat the price.<br />2.  I use it for a hitch mounted bike rack and it serves its purpose.<br />3. Extremely easy to install (easier with two people).<br />4.  I installed it on a 2011 Jeep Cherokee.  It rests below the bumper, unlike the factory installed hitch on this model.  When I was trekking through primitive  roads in the Rocky Mountains, my bike rack bottomed out a few times at the hitch.  This, however, was to be expected.  You can purchase a hitch that rest higher, but that would require cutting into the bumper or paying for a professional installation which would cost much more $$.  5 Stars it is.
B00JEUHVNG|5|so far so good! As promised by the name...Rugged!
B000VS8WLA|1|Product appears to be a &#34;second&#34; or &#34;goof&#34; because the tubular step is NOT welded squarely to the receiver insert so it sits crooked when installed and looks terrible because it is very easy to notice in relationship to the horizontal lines of truck tailgate and bumper.  The black traction plate is also improperly mounted too close to the receiver insert so when used as a step the finish of tube gets scratched by shoes as top of tube is not covered as it should be.  Very, very poor craftsmanship and quality control from Go Rhino.  I am not going to return because I am going to modify this piece of garbage myself, what a huge disappointment.
B00OO2W4SG|4|Worked Good. Painted Well, the Pick-up Panels are for racing though. It's on our 2008 Vette and looks good.
B008B2ZGAS|5|Excellent helmet. Quiet and very comfortable. Would buy again. Fits my head like a glove. Great looking graphics. Worth every penny.
B00BI4UW2S|1|As a veteran, I really wanted to love this sticker, but 3 letters ended up folded under themselves and 6 letters wouldn't transfer to my window.  I'm left with some unreadable phrase. The backing is different from the high quality POW stickers I bought, it held fast to the letters.
B00KAR14QW|4|Good product ! excellent value
B002JH7PEQ|5|i Like the power inverter because i can charge items that require a wall plug outlet. I am a trucker, my company issued me a device that can be charge only on a electrical wall outlet. With this product, i can keep my battery with power, just i need a cigarret outlet, which is standar in any normal vehicle.
B00ALGB7LO|5|Part fitted nicely and it was delivered on time.
B00A6RL3MG|5|Fit perfectly in my 2002 Ford Explorer.  No problems. Easy fix.
B00EI37NYQ|4|Put this sticker on my new pc build,looks great. however, there are a couple of flaws id like to point out. first, tryng to take sticker of paperback was a &#34;NIGHTMARE&#34;.I had got pretty livid with this process after messing with it for what would seem like 10 mins.Secondly,item is not quite 4&#34; (and yes i actually measured it with a ruler)Other than that the end result is worth the tedious work ,as it looks amazing
B0021VM4J6|4|Easy install. Check Youtube for videos. The videos were very helpful. The videos I watched were of kits from other companies but almost the same as the Zone Offroad kit. I Installed the kit a couple months ago no issues. Took around 3 hours then I had new tires installed and the truck aligned. Looks great.
B000BW8LQW|4|Bought this set for an 86 Jeep CJ7. The plugs work great, definitely smoothed out my idle. However, the boots did not fit correctly with my distributor cap. The boots themselves fit over the plug holes, but the ones I received are all right-angle boots. Because of this, it proved difficult to bend the plug wires around that angle inside the boot to correctly insert them into the cap's plug receptacle. I ended up throwing out those boots and just re-using the ones that were on my Jeep, which have no angle.
B0022ZAFOC|5|I put these in my Harley Sportster, and I swear it runs smoother. I've since put them in my chainsaw and mowers, all start easier and go further on a tank of gas.
B001ABMWU4|5|Easy to install just make sure that you reconnect he vacuum lines on the bottom of the factory intake piping towards the manifold and they are nice and tight because they can come lose or disconnect when you install this without totally removing the entire factory piping and assembling out of car like the instructions say to do! LOL I had mine on for a few weeks before I figured out where the vacuum leak and sound was coming from!  Follow the directions and you will be good LOL
B00NI2VPVU|3|The keyless entry have been working okay however I am not completely satisfied with the looks or the quality.
B000BLGPFM|4|Did good I thought they would be white but they were a yellow color but a great light and very bright fit my jeep wj perfect!
B0001MQ7EK|1|Handle broke immediately :(
B000P72C90|5|This magnetic spark plug socket was exactly as advertised.  It was also delivered faster than advertised.
B000CO8SCG|5|Had a little trouble getting it to attach but once we did it works great
B00MJV9KQS|3|I guess I was mistaken . I thought both ends were hinged , I have two 10' sewer hoses because of different camp ground hook ups, unless I keep them hooked together it is hard to get both out
B001OCOKM2|5|Dee Zee DB-2600 Heavy boxes(Steel)from Amazon are great. The only thing I can see to do and I have, is drill a hole in the bottem to drain the water out I don't care how much they claim to have sealed them your still going to get road splash inside them, which is no big deal, your not going to be caring your jocky shorts in them. They are great boxes and so far they haven't rusted any, but I'm not holding my breath because after all they are steel.
B004W8F312|5|nice tool, fits well no drips
B001CST5H8|5|Good rear lowering kit for GM SUVs. It worked great on my 2015 GMC Yukon. The parts are high quality and the instructions are good. Great price from amazon too!
B005FL74G2|5|I love these brakes.  They look great, stop consistently, have just the right amount of brake grab for that near factory feel, and don't warp when coming down a mountain pass under heavy braking.  I have purchased 3 sets of these for two different vehicles and have been very happy with all of them.<br /><br />The one downside is that they don't come with brake grease, so you will have to purchase that separately.
B00684TAYY|4|This is a great remote. I would have gave it five stars, but when I program that the porn when you push the lock button does not activate. Other than that this is very easy to activate it literally takes less than two minutes.
B006UKAZ1I|4|You can get rebuilt baffles for most 2 stroke seadoos, for less than half the cost of new just look on ebay and type in \\"rebuilt seadoo fuel baffle\\"
B000BO71DE|5|Works Great!! Best I've ever used!
B003ITFA9Q|4|Coming from an Innovate LC1 wideband with db gauge, this was a DREAM to install. o2 sensor in exhaust, wire harness runs to the gauge, then from the gauge there's a second harness with four pigtails. Power, ground, and two auxiliary outputs.  It's SO EASY to install compared to the rat's nest of wiring that an Innovate is.<br /><br />That said, I do miss the range of my LC1, which read as rich as 7.4:1 AFR. This pegs at 10:1.  It's still okay, since ideally I'd be higher than that anyway but it would be nice to see exactly where I'm at pre/during tuning.
B001RAQGXC|1|Not only did it not remove a tiny windshield scrape after an hour of polishing, but the white polishing crap has embedded itself all over the windshield and cannot be removed. Useless.
B0076KBPNI|5|Connected to my HTC One and the Torque Pro app.  Lots and lots of info that is beyond me for the moment with error codes.  Pretty awesome.
B002LFAQFG|1|I was under the impression that Borla was stamped or etched on the tip but there is nothing just looks like a cheap tip from the auto parts store. This is the only item that u have ever got from Amazon that i was not pleased with
B00BBF68BS|5|My uncle has a garage and lift he uses to work on cars so that made this install a breeze. There was some grinding involved. We had to grind about 1/4 inch of the existing strut bolts because the new ones that go on top of them protruded past the spacers. You don't want the bolts to be longer than the spacers. So we grinded them down ( very easy with the right tools ) and they fit perfectly after that. The install took about 2 hours ( grinding only added 10min ). I love the way my XK looks now with it being leveled with the rear. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a cheap leveling kit to make their Jeep stand out.
B008G3KCHE|5|Made my truck look great. Well built would recommend them to anyone.
B0072UGXSY|5|Exactly what I was expecting and came with clear instructions.
B0065S6S8Y|5|goood
B00M1OUBES|2|Before i start this review i will start out with a few facts that many will bring up regarding my review.  first, i am a licensed red seal technician and factory trained/certified dealer tech.  i have built many cars and spend 8 hours a day fixing them.  yes i read the directions and yes i know fully how to use it.<br /><br />my first test for it was a 2007 pathfinder.  i completely disconnected the battery and put it in manual over-ride. it managed to slowly start it once which i was a little dissapointed.  i tried a few more times and it could slowly crank it but not enough to start.  the next was a 2008 g35 with a battery that was showing 8.6v and was putting out 110cca (rated 550).  i let it sit for 30 seconds and tried to start it, no  go, let it sit for another 30 seconds, better but still no go.  i tried manual over ride and let it sit for another minute, still wasnt able to start it.  at this point i was vrry dissapointed, it should have easily started it but i feel due to the cold ambient temp (-1 celcius) the lithium battery was not at its ideal temp.  if its anything like my cordless tools lithium batteries dont like cold.  i returned it and bought a clore jnc660.  yes its big but i need it to work so the size is a trade off.  i disconnected the battery on a 2010 pathfinder with ambient temp around 0c i started it 10 timea back to back with a 2 second pause in between and the gauge still shows over 13v full charge.  i am very impressed.  amazing device and was only 60$ more than my gb30.  the gb30 is a good device for someone with a small 4 cylinder car in a warm climate but up north its maybe not the best.  overall a good device just not ideal for me.
B001P2FP7K|5|look great
B000GELE0U|5|I love my bike rack!!  I can't wait to be able to use it...dang snow!!  Many thanks for the quick shipping and the quality of the product!!  I would order from you again!!
B004I15GYW|5|Fits perfectly
B009CD0QVO|5|Excellent service and good product
B000C13UG8|5|Fit and worked as advertised.
B0015DU8QW|5|Works pretty well
B0068M7DZ4|5|Good deal on a plug that works in your Volvo, Experts say if you have a high boost turbo only factory Volvo plugs can cut it, for ALL the rest of us this is the plug to use. In my T5 and R models and doing fine.
B000VDRWRU|4|Fit: Maybe a little on the smaller side.  My hands are right on that Medium/Large line so I bought the large and they fit perfect, where large size gloves are usually a little loose on me.<br />Finish: My only complaint is that after getting caught in a bad rain storm, some of the black dye in the palms literally washed out of the glove leaving a couple grayish-greenish spots in the palms of the gloves.  I simply took a black sharpie & colored it back in.  So far so good.<br />Function & Durability: Since I haven't gone down with these on, I can only speculate that I think they would do a good job of protecting my hands.  The gloves are nicely padded & the leather feels quite durable.  Not to mention that they look pretty bad ass.<br />Some people have complained about stitching & things coming apart, but I haven't experienced any of that.  I would say that this is probably the best protection you're going to find for the money.
B001AW1ZSI|5|Replacement for an old Harley spark plug. Not the same as the original, but it gets you down the road.
B000LMT8F0|4|This is a great set of bags for the price.  I used them on a long trip because of the larger capacity.  I was skeptical about them being waterproof, but we rode in light rain for several days, and everything inside stayed dry.  The outside discolored after it got good and wet, but cleaned up once it dried.
B009I6BEDY|5|very nice
B00MGN9F0A|3|I like this item, but I'll be darned if I know how it's internally wired. It's switched, but it only powers down the right hand USB outlet. The left hand outlet at this point is dead regardless whether the switch is on or off. The lighter outlet is always live, with no affect by the switch being on or off. I know it's wired correctly because my dealer installed it, and I went over everything he did, and it is correct. I have a 2013 Triumph Street Triple R ABS and we chose to wire it into the relay used for the heated grips which I don't have a use for as I use heated glove liners powered directly off the battery.<br /><br />As others have said, the fit of the item on the handlebars is straightforward and the wiring is simple whether you choose to use a relay or connect directly to the battery. My install runs through a relay and is powered down when the ignition key is off. As of now, I only need one USB for my phoe and the lighter outlet for another item I use, so the second USB is no big deal and I don't feel like pulling the box apart and resoldering wires and regluing plastic. Doesn't look like anyone else has had my issues, so I guess quality control is the issue. Hence only three stars since it serves my purpose and wasn't completely dead on arrival.
B0007QGT34|5|Simply the best .... Not much else to say.  I Don't care to much about the unconventional bottle size (most gear oil utilizes that style bottle) reason being is you're most likely have to use a pump when changing gear oil.  Most pumps are for the conventional quart style bottles.
B000JL6Y0K|5|Great price, too!  I wish it were a little more heavy, but super cute and fits snuggly under my helmet!
B002R0I30U|5|Fit perfect and fixed the prob lem.
B00B8XE85Q|5|Second car I have put these bulbs in. Easy install and look great. No complaints.
B000FRQL06|5|First off the price is amazing, its the cheapest price I've found and amazed on how well this product works for so cheap. I rated this a five star because you couldn't ask for a better injector .if your thinking bout buying injectors for a throttle body go with this . If you need them soon, get them over night shipped ... I can't explain how good this price is. I've talked to a few ppl about there cars and how cheap they got they're injectors for the lowest was 80$ these are 50-60$ you save about 25$ its a no brainer not to get this . If you have old injectors and they're leaking thats not good. First your wasting gas because they're not spraying second its being to rich and third your wasting money on fuel .
B00C5SJRHC|1|I wanted this for my Rokon motorcycle that has 8&#34; wide tires.  The product description said the wheel chock is total of 9.6&#34; wide, which should be wide enough for 8&#34; tires.  However, the wheel chock is NOT 9.6&#34; wide, it's 8.2&#34; wide (including thickness of tubes) and the inside width is 6.5&#34;, not nearly wide enough for my motorcycle.<br />I didn't notice a question/answer had been posted that said the chock is for 6&#34; wide tires.  Well, I'll be returning it.
B0028OO33Q|5|Awesome part works great
B002E58JPC|5|Great product. Works as expected.
B00LG07MZE|5|Nice item, collapses to a very compact easy to store size. Fits my Ram 2500 winshield nearly perfect. An absolute must to help protect interior and dash from sun damage.
B000FQ1TTA|5|This oil cap fits a Jeep 2.5. Plastic is black, seal is rubber. Fits in to hole for which it was designed in the top of the valve cover. This oil cap prevents oil from coming out of the engine during operation or while engine in inverted. Oil cap may be easily removed to allow the addition of oil.<br /><br />Pros: cap is black in color, which helps hide dirt and grime.<br /><br />Cons: ineffective as a flotation device in the event of a water landing.<br /><br />What else is there to say? It's an oil cap.
B00HNKYD0I|1|After trimming the pieces to the desired length and installing them, the door edge guards kept peeling off, and when outside temperatures began to reach 90 degrees the glue dripped off the guards and got all over my new car's finish.
B00JJ7J42U|5|Love the safety kit.  Looks great in my new 2015 Jeep Cherokee!
B00BD5GYWO|3|I like the printed set I purchased, however it was to small for my seats and I did not save the paperwork that came with it to return.
B007JSGR9Y|5|easy to use
B00MEWPIOK|5|Wonderful. Very nice, sturdy and heavy shiny license plate frame. Looks great on my black car.
B000CMCNJC|5|It installed nicely, and replaced my very worn 2006 Honda Odyssey original equipment Mitsuboshi belt. Did it at the same time I did my timing belt, and it appears to be of excellent quality. My car is quieter with this belt...
B0091XUAY8|1|Not very bright and only worked for two months.
B000GKIDVM|1|Book had the wrong spec and I snapped a bolt and I don't like the way it described this better off spending the money on the factory service manual
B000ZIC18Q|5|Worked great, arrived on time
B000BQN1CC|4|Here's everything you need to know about the Warn Front Receiver hitch for WJ Grand Cherokee.<br /><br />For one, it fits 1999-2004 vehicles, but Warn developed this product in 2002 and never updated the description.  So if you have a 2003 or 2004, yes it will fit!<br /><br />Trimming your front bumper is absolutely required to fit this front hitch.  The lower 7-slat design hits it and the front fascia will not go all the way back on without trimming out the backside.  Also, the location of the hitch pin interferes with the slats so the middle two have to be cut out entirely.  Don't purchase this unless you are OK with some trimming because there is NO way to make it work without trimming.  Now, if you are into wheeling and Jeeping, you'll know that some of this is expected.  I'm ok with it.  It's very easy to trim and still make your Jeep look good.  If you have a 2004, then you are in-luck as you have a different front fascia that is more open and does not require trimming.<br /><br />You will also need to do some drilling.  One of the frame holes needs to be enlarged to 7/16\\" so that the fasteners can pass through. The directions are not clear at this point and I drilled out the wrong hole.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who has done this.  As a tip: do not drill out any hole that has a nut welded in it. These are the mounting holes for the front skid plate.<br /><br />Which brings me to another point - if you have the factory tow hook package up front, you have to remove them to install this hitch.  That's ok because you gain a much stronger recovery point and you can sell the tow hooks to another Jeep enthusiast for $60-70.  You also have to remove the OEM front skid plate (if you have it).  This hitch will hit the front skid and the holes don't line up...so it is one or the other.  The good news is that the front skid doesn't really protect much and is up so high you will probably never hit it on the trail.  You can make it work together by welding new tabs tothe front skid plate.<br /><br />So there's all the bad stuff out of the way.  Most of it is pretty minor but you deserve to know what to expect.<br /><br />The good stuff:<br /><br />This hitch is beefy, made from 1/4\\" plate steel and powdercoated black.  The powdercoating is high-quality and does not chip or scratch easily like some do.  The hitch does not stick out very far (it is shorter than the license plate) so you don't have something sticking out of the front, ruining the lines of your beautiful WJ.  It positions a multi-mount winch perfectly, just a few inches in front of the license plate.  It's at a very good height to make installing a multi-mount winch by yourself easier (they are very heavy). As a bonus, it adds vital protection to the bottom of your radiator and A/C condenser which are surprisingly vulnerable.  In this way, it is MORE useful than the front skid plate (which only really protects the sway bar)<br /><br />All in all, I give it 4 stars because of its strength, versatility, looks, performance, and protective ability.  The only thing holding back a 5-star is the amount of trimming required and that the hitch pin hole is absolutely inaccessible without cutting out the middle slats of the front bumper.
B001JT1CEE|5|Wire is wire. Get some for light duty projects
B002PQW4SI|5|Fit just like OEM parts, look great for a faction of the price. Installed in less then five minutes, both sides, perfect fit!
B001CF5EIU|1|Didn't fit on smittybilt bull bar. Unusable
B007VREQWI|1|Item arrived Defective.  The top pipe on the vertical column arrived severely dented / out of round...  So much so I couldn't even insert the turning plate into it let alone spin it...  Upon close inspection there's no visible damage to the powder coating which leads me to believe that the part was dented before powder coating, something quality control (if there is any) should have caught immediately.  I've e-mailed JEGS through amazon and am waiting to hear back on how they are going to take care of this.<br /><br />I'm really hoping they'll just send me a replacement and tell me to keep the defective one since the Fedex man delivered the package in a rain storm and didn't bother to plastic bag it, so the box was mush by the time I got home from work and just fell apart when i tried to move the package inside.  I don't want to have to try and find a box to ship this POS back.<br /><br />Also I went to put this thing together the first free day I was able to pull my motor out, now I have to wait until the next free day (which could be weeks) I can find to pull my motor since I don't have an engine stand to put the motor on...
B007ZDOS9Y|2|The spherical shape of this flange did not even come close to matching the shape of a new Honda flex socket gasket.  I didn't want to risk welding this up only to have leaks.  Maybe there are different flex socket shapes over different year/model Hondas, but for an Integra/Civic/CRX, this flange does not look like it would make a good seal. Maybe you have to use only a Blox gasket, but this is not clear from Amazon or Blox descriptions.  I need a quick and high quality repair, not more experiments, so I'm going with OEM Honda.<br /><br />Comes with way too big \\"D\\" shaped holes that the spring pigtail falls through.  Does not have the nice OEM size looking holes like shown in the product photo.<br /><br />The finish on the stainless is very nice, and the stamping otherwise looks to be very high quality.
B000EDST1K|5|Travels well on top of the stove.
B000YC6R24|4|The design of the Kia Sedona you need these to help keep even a lite mist out. They were easy to install. Do pay attention to the leave windows closed for 12 hrs. it helps seat the deflectors.
B000C5UFT4|5|Some cars need better performance o2 sensors and this would be one of if not the best out there, works great on my 427ci LS1 motor.
B000C57Y7U|5|perfect fit, good quality for 02 Silverado 3500
B005VFWOOE|5|shippment arrived without delay. product was as described in ads. I just love its design.so far I had only positive remarks and/or reactions.
B002QZD8EC|5|excellent product until now it has worked so good...no problem with the product.thanks you very much. nice day and regards
B0068EQCPO|5|Just what I wanted at a great price... quick delivery.
B0017KJ0A8|5|Awesome just got this and the 4x4 one that matches for my 88 jeep wrangler. This thing looks sweet, plus it feels great. Comes with a cool silver nut for under which was nice addition also, it's a cool knob you can just wipe clean in seconds highly recommended for all you off roasters out there
B0002J229Q|1|It was not the right wiring harness. It wouldn't hook up to my truck.
B005DLUS8U|5|Very nice goes with my black car very well!  Had it for about 5 months now and it's not faded or chipped!
B00B9IVRCW|3|Like several of the other current reviews for this item, ours didn't work.  Luckily I came back to Amazon, read through the reviews, and we were able to find the unattached yellow wire and get it working.  Very poor quality control on the vendor's part.  Hopefully the product will continue to function now the yellow wire has been grounded.
B004LF4SBW|5|This Main Circuit Board for an RV converter was just what we needed to keep our 12dcVOLT system up and running. The 12dcVolt lights had started flickering so we called WFCO and after a few simple trouble shooting steps it was determined that this Main Circuit Board was what we needed. Our order was delivered promptly. We carefully followed the installation instructions and the new board and was up and running within 30 minutes (115acV input and 12dcV output).<br />Trouble Shooting: While the light flickering was accruing we disconnected the 12 Volt Battery. The lights started getting dimmer by the second proving that the Converter was not supplying the 12dcVoltage required. We reconnected the battery and placed the order for a new MBA.
B004GD9AA8|5|Fantastic deal on OEM handle. Fit like a glove. The panel clips from GM were more expensive than the handle! I need not mention the dealer cost on this part but it was overpriced. I have 35 years of journeyman experience as an automotive and truck mechanic.
B004QUBZ9A|3|You have to modify to fit your application-mine is a snow thrower
B00480FHJC|5|Phillips, Thank you for removing g the needless greedy markup for a car headlight bulb, and providing us with a comparable to factory replacement at a bargain basement price!!!
B0002SR8AK|5|love this .. it came in handy a lot when i put in my new headlights on my truck and in my wifes truck .. so definitly buy it im glad i did
B000TKFMFY|1|My car is several years old and has a water leak problem. We had a heavy rain and this cover provided no protection at all. BEWARE! There's a difference between water resistant and water proof.
B007WQQNQA|2|As an experienced 30 + year mechanic, a lot of &#34;back yard mechanics &#34;are causing many headaches for the professional with this tool ! ( and high repair bills for the customer) . NEVER EVER pierce a computer sensor wire with the probe !  Corrosion will eventually set in and cause the resistance of the circuit to increase ! This results in&#34; check engine lights&#34; and many hours of labor to repair.
B001F22FDC|5|Awesome git the truck great. Easy to put on. I think the truck rides better now than with  the factory shocks.
B000CB42O2|1|Does not include any hardware. Item returned
B005T3X0FU|5|great price. was a life saver. my second one. got into an accident earlier this year. rear ended someone. protected alot of my car.
B00RSOLXFM|3|👍
B002WRRNFO|4|Got this thing to go under the seat of my jeep wrangler 06'. The cable is convenient and I might end up placing it in the back seat instead.  It is durable and well built. The only problem I have with it is that the locking pin (as seen in the figure as the end of the cable that is inserted into the box) is not fixed to the box. You insert it and then turn the key to lock the box, and then unlock the box and remove the pin to pull the drawer out. A bit inconvenient and is altering my thoughts of securing it under the seat because it might be too difficult to get the pin out.
B00B7QEUWU|4|Great cover. A bit heavy to move easily but does a great job
B000AMKU44|5|A little tight to open and lock in place, but a very good addition for the road.
B000KPSA0W|5|I had decided to spring for this unit as opposed the \\"660\\" because of the few [but amazing] reviews I had read (particularly the ability to leave it plugged in and it won't overcharge). The 660 comes up as #1 in regards to user reviews here on amazon, but that simply because of the NUMBER of reviews. This JNC950 unit has equally good reviews, but only 10% of the reviewERS. Well, I decided to spend the extra for this unit. It jump started my 91 camaro from a complete cold and dead battery - didn't have to hook directly to battery terminals either. It then started an old piece of crap camry several hours later. This thing was seam less - both cars cranked as if their batteries were completely charged.    if you're looking at the 660, but want something even more hardcore - buy this unit. It's worth it, it's not a toy (heavy as hell) and will jump start anything. no frills attached, no light, no nothing. just a jumpstarter.
B0031HQ0PI|5|Strong.  A little tough to pull down at first, but as I figured, getting easier.  Gas escapes, which is why these slowly fail, which means being a little tough to start is not a bad thing.
B000C2SHC4|5|Received in good condition.
B007R55BEQ|5|love it
B000FPXXHC|5|As described, and correct for for my 1983 CJ7. Works as expected.
B0075D0S1Q|1|They are as described, however they do not stay on the wheels at all. I purchased six of them, I only have three left now. And many hours wasted looking for them on the side of highways. I was so excited to get them, they are not cheap either. So I'm rather annoyed that after just a few weeks of having them on my trailer three have already fallen off.
B00JIIZCM6|1|Review of this product is soo good. But it's not all that. It works the same as leather cleaner from local store for cheaper.
B005MZM69G|5|The description says it all really. Connection is easy, and the battery has already lasted me more than a year. You may need to look up the manual for your specific alarm unit to know how to connect it though. It doesn't come with instructions.
B00E1SM8IY|3|Bought these for a 2004 Ford F-150, turns out there are many different calipers for that year.<br />These were smaller than my OEM calipers so I couldn't use them. I gave 3 stars because they arrived promptly and seemed to be good quality.
B001VXXUWK|4|I am a wood turner and I have used many different brands of face-shields; many of the shields fit too close to your face and cause viewing problems. This face-shield has many adjustments and can be moved out further from the face. It never fogs up and the clarity is outstanding. I do wish the face-shield lens was made of a thicker material; but the wraparound construction will probably increase the impact strength. I do have one slight problem and that is that the lens is so clear that at times I am not sure if I have the shield up or down; but I can live with that one!!
B0075JYPNM|3|It's an okay sticker. Love the quote but as other reviewers have said it is small. I don't mind the smallness but my issue was with actually putting the sticker on the car. And before I get a bunch of &#34;you need to read the instructions&#34; comments, let me tell you that this is the issue, no instructions were sent with the decal. Seeing as I have never put this kind of decal on my car before it's taken some time to figure it out. Looked pretty junky before we figured out that the plastic top coat comes off. Seems like getting instructions may depend on who your seller is. We will see if the letters come off now that we have the top layer of plastic off.
B00513G82U|4|Make sure all nuts are tight, I lost the top portion of the locking mechanism that the latch hooks in to because the nuts vibrated off. Other than this operator error, this works/fits/looks great on my '02 Road King.
B00LR6F2AY|1|I must say I was really excited to get these for my Challenger, however, it looked more like a cheap Chinese knock-off than a genuine Mopar part. They appeared sturdy enough, made a decent construction, the paint-job was horrendous. It looks good from a distance, but when you get close there's no denying it. I've attached a photo so you can see how poor a job they did. Very disappointment.
B0006MRR1M|2|I have had to replace this valve 3 times now.  As far as I know this is the only available valve for the La Toilette. The plastic valve works poorly when new, and the plastic lever wears out very fast. I wish I could find a better quality valve (metal).  The good part is Amazon sells it much cheaper than an RV store and it is delivered to your door. You should buy two so you don't have to order as often.
B000KXA6HY|1|It does not do it's job. Plain and simple. How do you find such a large flat surface area to begin with? Even with it, it only have about 10 lb lift power.
B003YNQEO6|5|Great product
B002PYBZJO|5|This is a must have if you have any sort of modern car. I've used it quite a bit and it's a powerful troubleshooting tool. I mean, how great is it that instead of a tedious process to figure out why your hoopty is running rough to have the computer tell you &#34;Cylinder 5 misfire&#34;. That narrows it down quite a bit and saves tons of time. Going to AutoZone will get you the error code, and maybe some advice. This will tell you what's wrong.
B008IK7TSA|5|Works great, only had to adjust the idle. The choke lever is too long though.
B0018PSATY|1|The advertised 12 oz. is actually 1.2 oz. This makes this the worst Hylomar unit price I've ever seen rather than the best. Very successful marketing however, as I bought several other items from Auto Alley and paid the shipping charge all because of the \\"great deal\\" on 12 oz. of Hylomar.
B008XKE7DA|5|Excellent product, excellent price, excellent shipping.
B00CHET878|5|My mom loved them!!
B003V9TC10|5|I bought these for several vehicles for easier access to the valve stems and as review title says:No leaks,works great.
B00CGGXRK6|5|Ordered this for a vacation road trip from Texas to Alabama and it worked like a champ on my 2014 GMC 1500 short-bed. Took a little longer than promised to install, but overall not that difficult. Would definitely recommend this item if you're looking for a cost-effective way to keep rain and elements off any items in your bed.
B000KF8HZA|3|pricy
B00NEL6HK4|5|Excellent filter,and yes it does fit right in if you know how to put it in properly.
B00BUVBVCO|4|Got this for my husband who likes it and also a die hard  St Louis Cardinal fan. Would buy again.
B000R5G0DO|5|works good
B00062YFNA|5|Competition Cams 79011 Pushrod Length Checker<br /><br />One complete turn equals .050 inch. Couldn't be simpler to use! Highly recommended! Very happy with purchase.
B003CH3Z8W|5|Great
B005FYR3NI|5|Bought these for my Hubby's Teryx...They are great! Easy to put on and will work great!  These were cheaper than others for his Teryx, so we thought we'd try and are pleased with them!
B00AEUZH9A|5|love this helmet it looks really good and fits just right thinking of getting some of the graphics tattooed on me
B007TG7IJY|5|I never thought i'd be excited over wipers!  These things are nice. As soon as they come out of the box you can see the difference in materials.  The soft materials give it a natural curve that hugs the glass well.  Wipes away without a streak. Very nice. Wish I'd known about these decades ago!
B003WSNYXW|5|Love it.......
B000UKBE28|5|The caps that I have received are black and made our of semi soft rubber.  They fit right in where the old plastic ones had deteriated in the sun and work just fine so far.  it was easy to take out the old ones and put in the new.  I just used a pocket knife to pop them out and pushed the new ones in.
B001GFW5Q0|5|Used this to wrap PVC drain pipe running through stack from second floor through to basement. Provided good noise dampening. Planning to use around pex tubing in the basement for heat insulation. Easy to cut and apply.
B00IJL8WNY|4|Can't complain for the price - fits my seat nicely and looks good. I love that it's two-piece, and it even covers more of the back of the seat than the original upholstery did. I did break one or two of the elastic straps installing it and could've used a couple more hooks than were included, but it wasn't hard to work around that. If the elastic were stronger, I'd give it 5 stars.
B00AZ4S49K|3|Didn't fit as well as I thought they would.  But a friend helped me w/ a trick he learned and they fit perfect!
B0007T25U2|5|Kind of pricey but gives a new car a finished look. Note the price is per cover, not for two.
B00DAL9908|4|Looks nice, good quality.
B000H2W270|5|this is a K30, made by K40.  take note its not a k40
B000CJ0MUC|3|Even though amazon's vehicle matching tool said these would work with my truck they did not. My truck requires the hub to be part of the rotor (2WD) these rotors were for a 4x4. Probably great rotors, just were the wrong ones for my truck.
B008FIH17Y|2|The scrapper worked perfectly on frost but on the first ice of the season(less than 1/8&#34; think) it broke. This supposed to be a heavy ice scrapper so I was shocked when it broke so quickly. Side note, I am the Hulk. It broke on the handle which makes me believe that it was just a defective molding but when I wanted to replace just one of the gloves (wife won't let go of the other) I can't get a replacement for just the broken one. Guess I'll have to go to a brick and mortar store for things like this, not Amazon.
B002G4IR6W|5|It looks awesome! It is high quality material. Seems like it will last a long time. It's easy to apply. Ships quickly. Seems like it will last a long time. You can't go wrong.<br /><br />The only issue was there's no directions included. Not that you need them, but it would be nice, especially since I had trouble figuring out which side went down. (the sticky side is the side on the white paper.  The side on the clear plastic faces out.)
B00MYS5ZDS|5|Great product easy to work with and matched the red on my gti perfectly thumbs up
B002TF2T4O|5|The register is located in a high-traffic area and this will be the third unit I've purchased in 8 years; but the first time I've bought this brand. Appears to be a heavier unit and should last longer than the previous two. Good value, fit, finish and quality.
B005RJ3GBE|1|Got this last year to replace the factory Shell that had a broken key chain connector. From the beginning the factory key did not fit properly therefore the key wouldn't &#34;flip&#34; out. You have to hold the button and pry it out every time you need to use the key. The &#34;d&#34; ring broke off after a month and the entire shell cracked and fell apart. Avoid this item at all cost! I finally went to VW and got the factory original for $62 and moved the guts over. Works like a charm as it should.
B00AUFOC36|5|Very easy to install, great product.
B002RNFP3A|4|Works good.
B007UV8XP6|5|This key chain is so cute! It matches the 2013 Camaro RS package I just bought. I wish I could have found a key chain in the shape of the car, but this is very cute. It's also quite heavy.
B003TQIIPG|3|got my package today, okay packaging. the description said it comes with a spray gun.<br /><br />FALSE! they even highlighted where is says &#34;GUN&#34; on the receipt. so I'm assuming the person forgot. I am very upset. I wanted to spray it on, on the weekend. but i guess ill have to wait.
B003JIGOUK|5|Fast delivery, excellent product!
B00HDPO8CG|5|Worked out great
B00CHT67HC|3|These were okay, the price was right, but the length was way too long. Also looked like these were worn, the bottoms looked like they were dragged around. I did not hassle with returns because who knows what size a new pair would be. I had my wife, who sews fix these to the length I needed.
B00IIJAGSQ|5|I am a 62 year old woman riding a for the first time in 30 years. These things are saving e a lot of  scrapes, bumps and bruises. Very easy to use.
B0000WUM4C|4|Works well.
B003A2E7KE|5|With hurricanes being more frequent to landfall you would be better off buying these, the side feature lights up an entire area. We all have them cheap flashlights in the drawer while those don't last long or the batteries 'get crusty' just toss them out if they get that way for that's battery leakage over time. With these you can charge them up once and theres no leakage to corrode anything and they hold a charge for a looooong time
B004GFS2C8|5|Worked surprisingly well for a crack in the front windshield
B001EP0GQS|5|Its a good thing we can add this tow package in our Lexus without the cost of the dealer. Its very simple to put in just need a extra hand to hold it while you screw in the hitch.  I did it by myself using a couple boxes or anything that can raise one side, to get the lift I needed while I screw in the other. must buy if you plan to maximize your vehicle with towing!
B008AYL912|5|My lights are great I travel a lot of back roads and the illumination was awesome.
B00176DDPK|5|Arrived quickly, worked just like if i had bought it in a store. Just make sure to let it get to room temperature before you start spraying
B00FRHOGU6|1|The worse blades. My old ones use clean better than those ones.
B001ABPKUS|5|These are exactly what you need if you are in need of a set of extension mirrors for towing a travel trailer!  We have a 2012 GMC Sierra 1500 and a 2010 Keystone Travel Trailer and before we got these mirrors, it was very difficult to see when towing the trailer.  However after receiving these mirrors from Amazon, even I can tow the trailer!  They give you a view that the factory mirrors could never do!  They have very little vibration and are so easy to get on and off the factory mirrors!  They have padding included so you don't scratch your factory mirrors!  Everyone towing a trailer should have a set of towing mirrors!!
B00I5VCGGW|5|better than I expected, these are thick and clamps will take a finger off if not careful.
B00D9AG9P8|5|great service,  very happy
B00B1M3224|5|Sent these to my brothers family- they were attacked! They gave the stickers a 5 star and they immediately went on cars and laptops.
B00018ZWFO|4|This battery has worked out very well for my nephew's power wheel. It has definitely been a lot better than the battery that came with the car and it seems to be the exact battery. My nephew rides around in his car about 6-8 hours before we charge it again. The only reason it's 6-8 hours is because he drives it on the yard/grass and our driveway that isn't of pavement which takes a requires a little more power. I think if he was to drive it on smooth pavement the battery would last a lot longer. It was definitely a good buy since I was skeptical it would turn out like the one that came with the car which it didn't and not to mention, the total price (including shipping) was about $25! Most people I spoke to said they had purchased their power wheels batteries for at least $35.
B006Z907TY|4|Like another reviewer said, I wish I didn't need this but am relieved to have it. I can fit into a regular seatbelt but sometimes I feel very constricted. I bought this after a flight a month ago where the flight attendant had me wait right inside the jet bridge door while she made kind of a huge production about getting me a seatbelt extender. I felt as though I were a character in a movie where a drugstore clerk gets on the loudspeaker and asks for a price check on something really embarrassing. Anyway, I brought this extender on a recent United flight. It worked in both the large plane and the much smaller connecting airplane.<br /><br />The one flaw I have found with this seatbelt extender is the difference in color from most airplane seat belts, which are usually either gray or blue. This extender is black. A few reviewers commented that the color difference makes the extenders more noticeable to flight attendants, who might give you a hard time about not using the airline's extender. Conscious of this issue, I slipped my belt on discreetly and then used either my coat, shirt, or airline blanket to cover my black extender while still keeping the blue airline belt visible during the seatbelt check. I had no issues. If you are just using your extender to give you an extra inch or so of room, I recommend concealing the long seatbelt \\"tail\\" that hangs off the extender. I tucked mine into my shirt.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a great product but use it carefully to avoid extra attention from the flight crew.<br /><br />Update on 1/19: I used this extender again (on another United flight), and this time, the flight was longer and I was seated more conspicuously in the exit row. I was also one of the last people to board the plane due to a very short layover, and I thought the entire row would notice me using the extender. If nothing else, this experience made me realize that most airplane travelers are not (despite how I felt busting out this extender) staring at you. I don't think anyone noticed. I also realized about halfway through the flight that my extender had become visible while I was sleeping, despite my earlier attempts to conceal it. The flight attendant definitely saw it when she did a seatbelt check, but if she noticed that it was an extender, she didn't say anything. I noticed that a few of the other seatbelts nearby were not all the same color. So I will use this going forward with a little less paranoia, and I still highly recommend it.at you. I don't think anyone noticed. I also realized about halfway through the flight that my extender had become visible while I was sleeping, despite my earlier attempts to conceal it.

B0016IUXTS|1|Amazon is trying to pull a fast one here but not with me! This AC Delco # 24231519 is for a set of five bolts. Amazon sent ONE (1) bolt in some kinda of re-packaged baggy definitely not OEM . If you look anywhere like Rock Auto.com this AC Delco number is for a bag of FIVE (5) BOLTS. Does Amazon really think I am paying 5 BUCKS for ONE metric bolt, I DONT THINK SO!!!!!
B00CZEZNGU|5|Produce lots of nice quality light. Well made and easy to install. They also look good in my trailer.
B00LNDQ930|1|This light was installed in RV within 3 days the bulb was smoking, the insert bulb melted. Waste of my money and time!
B001UEBT9G|5|i love these decals because they are a great accent for my rear window on my truck and they look fantastic. GO BRUINS
B004ZF48OA|5|The real deal no words
B002UJVNFA|1|They are really really bad! They do not hold air enough as they should. They are also relatively short! they look very cheap too.
B000NKCM2Q|5|the sound is amazing,beast.! i have a stock exhaust and it sounds like a monster. people won't ever think that a civic is coming. i love the increase in acceleration. you will definitely notice it @ 2,7k rpm up to 7. i love it..!! definitely recommend this product. plus its a k&n, reliability and brand has its reputation. 5 stars
B000FQ1QW0|5|I replaced my old fixed position 4 Pt harness with this inertial reel system and it was long over due. Easy installation and works like a charm in my 1974 Alfa Romeo GTV. Street use car.
B001P6GONU|5|Good Quality. Great price!
B001NPUNLM|4|This car cover is slightly small for my 2000 Camry. This makes it challenging to put on. It needs labeling as to front back and sides. It doesn't fit well at all if you try to put it on backwards, and there's nothing to tell you that you have put it on backwards. I labeled the front back and sides with tape so that I put it on in the correct direction. Then it's a tight fit, but works. However, it seems to be well made and is lasting well.
B00AVQSFT6|5|It fits Nicely slides right on and adds color to your keychain. I loved it. i bought it to add color to my keys its Pretty and pink.
B0027M109Y|5|Helps save gas, easy to install,improves gas mileage,need to buy kit to clean to clean filter rather than replacing fit better than regular filters.
B009UOPSOK|5|Easy to change bulbs and lookf great.
B00FRHOJYE|5|easy to install and works as well
B000VX9DYA|5|Gosh it carries my helmet.
B00480J4PU|5|These headlights are definitely whiter/brighter than factory OEM bulbs.  I liked them so much I bought an extra pair as backup.
B0012ZEZ8A|3|I purchased this \\"kit\\" as an xmas gift.  What I received was all the described items stuffed into an amazingly small brown soggy box.  No padding, nothing.  No joke, you could not get a tighter fit.  Unsurprisingly, one of the bottles burst leaving quite a messy affair.    Meguiar's is decent stuff, but please purchase at your local retailer.  This version has been \\"value engineered\\" down to the most pathetic packaging imagineable.  The only upside is you get to enjoy the pretty smell without even opening the box.
B00CBKOP7G|5|Clean fit and finish, threads were the exact size and gave no issues during installation.<br /><br />i bought these to correct the codes that the VW/Audi ATQ V6 is known to throw for the down-stream O2 sensors.  There was a factory TSB to reprogram the ECU, but since that program has expired long ago, the easiest solution was to install these spacers.  I think it took longer to get the car in the air than to install these.  Installation is simple - remove the O2 sensor, install the spacer onto the sensor, and install back into the exhaust.  Took maybe 5 minutes under the car to do both sides.  CEL went away shortly after installation.
B004MDEV38|5|The only way this install could've been simpler would be if someone else actually did it.  Five (5) bolts and you're done.  The printed directions were spot on.  The YouTube video was even better.  If you screw this up you're stupid!  Fit and finish are excellent.  It's made in America.  Glad to know we still make something worth buying.
B000RDLAZY|1|It didn't fit the car it said it would and it didn't look at all like the photo had to return it.
B000COC0GQ|5|Bought on feb.19 2012 for my WRX.  40,000 miles later and I'm just starting to think about taking a look at it.  I paid $33.80 back then.  I plan on keeping the car for a few more years.  So, I saved money not buying disposable paper filters.
B000H0UK0I|3|If you do not want to put a lot of money into a bike rack then this is a good choice.  It was well built though the frame work is thinner then the expensive ones.  The fold down feature is great and easy to use. It has some side to side movement that can not be corrected by tightening the bolts.  It is easy to load and straps are secure but no additional stability straps are included.  Bungee cords work but you need to use padding in order not to scratach the bike.  The rack did not come with assembly or installation instructions.  The very odd shaped cotter pin is very difficult to put in and remove but it did not come with instructions so perhapas there is an easier way I am not aware of.  If you only haul you bike occasionally for short trips this rack is a good cost saving choice.
B008BE02GO|5|Agreat headlight bulb. It provides a wider and longer depth range.
B0009JKI86|5|NICE AND QUIET.
B000C5G88Q|5|Just a little hard to get into place without breaking (probably better to do i t when it's not 30 degrees outside) Dresses up the truck quite well.
B004QEF9WA|1|This does not fit a 2&quot;pipe on the hitch jack.  I should have read one of the other reviews but did not.
B000U0Z2L2|5|I purchased six of these and not one has failed
B000EPXYLS|5|I bought these for my '99 Civic Ex, they are rear rotors. Originally my Civic had drums in the rear, but I did a trailing arm swap two years ago for rear disc.<br /><br />This is a very good deal going for ~$20 dollar per rotor with free shipping at the time of this review. Usually that price is around $45-$60.<br /><br />The rotor is coded R for right or passenger side, unfortunately I could not find a similar deal on the left rotor so I ended up buying two of these and mounting them on both driver and passenger side. I was a bit worried about this, but an hour's research in the subject leads me to believe that the R or L rating for slotted rotors only really matters for rotors' with &#34;vanes&#34; which is in the reference picture but NOT on the actual rotor. This rotor is one single piece without any vanes.<br /><br />So far after a weeks ride on these rotors I do not see any ill effects of the inversely mounted rotor.
B002692308|5|Fit very well, arrive on time.
B006ZSUR5O|4|Lift works well however it has a dead spot up until 40% of the way up. After that the pressure kicks in and lifts the hood with tremendous force. I would certainly buy this lift again.
B00FA7X0DM|5|Dragonfly decal is beautiful and better that advertised
B00851UX7Q|5|I use this for my 2015 Ducati 899 Panigale. So far so good fits great and provides plenty of clearance so as not to rub on fairings.
B009ANA37I|3|Came with a dead battery.  Difficult to change it out.<br />Smaller than what I had expected, but not in a bad way.<br />Packaging was all crushed.
B00INCTGY8|5|Great fit! Well made!
B0053ZNMDE|5|A bit expensive but far less messy than the liquid.  We use it for small machine screws (#8, #10, 6mm, 8mm) when assembling AC motor drives.
B004K2MG3I|5|Great
B004A35L6Q|5|Dealership wanted over $900 to replace my hydrobooster. Midas wanted $700. I replaced it myself with a few metric tools in about 2 hours. The only problem is that the rod that connects to the brake pedal is slightly shorter than the original part, which causes the pedal to not come back quite far enough to close the brake switch to turn off the lights. I've fixed it by putting a few rounds of tape around the pedal to make it bulge out and hit the switch. I've recently learned, however, that this is a common problem with after-market hydroboosters and a little time on Google should yield instructions to adjust the switch. I'm looking forward to fixing it for good.<br /><br />The part came on time and save me a ton of time and money.
B0007RDVE8|5|This polymer is very easy to apply and take off and leaves a very nice shine, I used it in my Audi black 2014 to provide washed look and depth... but I confess I did an experiment, I want to protect the paint and a long lasting shine, Second I want a just washed look and add depth in your paint (3D Effect), so I bought the “California Gold Brazilian carnauba&#34; and &#34;Mother Reflections Car wax&#34;. On the first day applied the carnauba and the second day the polymer. Result...the paint protected, extreme shine and looks always like car from exhibition of autoshow.
B00KMNUL5E|2|Tried to replace my turn signals with these.<br />The turn signal worked great, but the running lights didn't. The white LEDs would flash on for a second when you plug it in, but then go out. The car works fine with standard bulbs, so it leads me to believe there was a problem with the bulbs.<br />Amazon gave me a refund though, so no problems.
B009DK0I9Q|5|I used this item for my 1995 Suzuki Escudo. It worked just fine and felt sturdy. it also came with the little piece of plastic to attach to the end of the door rod. It looks fantastic and was just what i needed.
B002LF0BQA|5|Perfect fit for the front of my 07 Camry.  Light weight molded vinyl with tall rims- should catch any potential spills.
B0010GG7YG|5|Exact GM part.  Installed easy and works great.  Fixed my issues.
B0000AYES4|5|I use it all the time and it works great!!! I have a construction Company and it is so nice to be able to change balls Immediately when you need to. All I can say is buy this product and you won't be unhappy. Good Luck on yours!!
B001O0GHCA|4|Nice finish, great fit w/ supplied key wrench. Seem well built & sturdy. Reccommend this product to go with matching lugnuts
B008M603YM|5|Item came exactly as described. Color matched perfectly. Instuctions came with. I had a shop install it. I didny want to mess up trunk lid due to the fact of drilling holes.  Overall great experience with company and purchase.
B008NGZTA4|3|The print of the decal is fine, but the glue is not as sticky as I would have expected.  Even after applying one to glass, I could shift it around with my fingers, almost like a water-transfer decal.  Its still on there, but I dont know how long it will last.  If it stays on for the long haul, I will certainly upgrade my review.
B000GGO52C|4|This is not the first time I've used POR-15, nor will it be the last... this stuff is so tough!<br /><br />My first experience with silver instead of black. Wow, I stirred it for, I don't know, 7-8 minutes, and there was still a bit of oily dark streaking in the can. Well, after coating and drying, the color of the resultant finish is not, er, monochromatic. Instead a bit mottled. As this is only the inside of an old keggerator I'm going to use, it is not a big deal, no one else will ever see it.
B005SH6NRO|5|Item delivered on time, was as described
B00TEFRIAM|5|Awesome product..delivery was on time...very pleased
B006IC6OJ0|1|Quality of film was not as described and not what could be called as 'carbon fiber' because the texture and pattern of the sheet, was much smaller and cheap quality. I even paid paid for return shipping. It was very unsatisfied transaction.
B0024E6W4S|5|Great fit on both sides, and a quality piece.<br /><br />Somebody needs to clue in the marketing department that you shouldn't cover a clear plastic part -whose whole function is to be clear- in stickers.  Other than that, it does exactly what is supposed to do, which is a good thing.
B0024E6ZRW|5|Works great.......I think you need to buy two per step it would probably work even better than one.I plan to buy another one in the future because I do a lot of camping....Word to the wise,It might not be a bad idea to purchase both Save-a-Step heights because I noticed that sometimes when you level your camper the step height can very a lot and the last time I went camping I had to add some wood underneath the brace so that it would be high enough to reach the bottom of the step...other than that good product...
B000E4D5YA|5|I ordered the product off of Amazon for less than 50% of what toyota sells it for.  Its just like OEM, you can't tell the difference.  Product arrived in 7 days of shipping, and even came with light bulbs.  Very happy with the product.
B000KL38U8|5|I would recommend these floor mats to anyone. They fit perfectly in my 2006 Ford F-150 and do a great job protecting my carpet from all the mud, sand, and water. Must have, especially during the winter!
B002YCE5V2|5|Great product!
B000JZH0D6|5|It's a well constructed belt that's clearly superior over a stock replacement. Glad I purchased it, and have peace of mind. Even if I didn't have all the boost and aftermarket parts, I'd still buy this again as a stock replacement. Being that for only 40 bucks more I don't feel like I have to worry.
B007GCDM46|5|Worked out great for us.  About half the cost of the same battery from Verizon!
B007TG7HVS|5|Super easy to install and they work great.  I have to fit 12 more words to fulfill my comment box but I really don't need anymore than that first sentence.
B00JOC23MI|5|Fit as advertised.Looks great.
B008Y3OVLY|5|Does what it's supposed to do, what more can I say?
B003FBV8ZW|5|nice
B0067UCAXM|1|The box arrived clean and undamaged, the mount was wrapped in a sealed plastic bag, but the mount to the engine had the wron offset from the centre pin to the first engine mount bolt. I will have to return it and search for another mount. It appears that the MTC 9077 Engine Mount (Right) Bj0N-39-06Ye appears to be correct, but I will do more research on the DEA mounts.
B001341K92|3|None of the gems fell off but it yellowed badly from the sun.
B004I0NCIU|5|The installation was a pain in the neck. But the price was prefect. Very happy with this product. I would purchase it again.
B000C3YTM0|5|Great product
B0050HC6V4|5|great item.recommended seller
B00E9ANSGU|5|Great cables, long reach 25'.  You can pull in front or behind a car to jump it.
B002QBNH9W|2|The carburator starting to work good almost one week after it i feel loss power again now scooters is down
B001NAUBU0|5|Always an excellent product and prompt delivery via Amazon.
B000JFJLP6|4|After 2 yrs mind still working
B00BTHQFMU|4|The light was cooler (more bluish)  than I expected, but not annoyingly so. The color is very close to that of the leds in our refrigerator. These were rated at 5,000K, if I were to do it over I would have looked for something in the 4,000K range. They all went in easily and are much brighter than the halogen bulbs they replaced.
B006FYWZTE|4|They are a decent enough replacement, but they feel flimsier than the originals.
B00B3UTGEW|5|Matched perfectly
B003XWB7UE|5|Amazing tool for occasional use!
B00URUPSYQ|5|WOW! This is a deal.  Great value and price.  Product met and exceeded my expectations.
B003IS3HV0|2|I'm used to Maguires...I like the smell.  Honey leather was real thick and did not have the smell that I am used to.
B005VKQZ80|5|This is the OEM part and, as expected, fits perfect. Just be aware that it comes in the light gray color (not black) and DOES require color match paint to be applied.
B000CO86BY|5|Great quality! Well done and able to hold my heavy SUV 2004 Mercury Mountaineer V8.<br />Don't listen to bad reviews.
B007K94YVU|5|I put these in my 97 Cummins.  Boost is mechanical, other 2 are electric.  I put the trans temp in my engine oil because I have a stick shift.  I probably need to separate the signal wire for it from others wires though, it picks up from my stereo and the needle bounces when the stereo volume is up. This is only with the oil temp though (its mounted on the dash), the other 2 are mounted down low by the transfer case shifter and they don't get any interference.
B000EQ1PSQ|5|Had a leaky caliper that I just couldn't get to seal up, so a remanufactured unit was the way to go.  Exactly as described, this is a drop-in replacement for the stock caliper.  Looks so nice on the car in place of the rusty, leaky unit that I might replace the remaining three.
B0000AY69V|5|I have used this for 2 weeks, after a friend with a Corvette Grand Sport recommended it. So far, it has worked perfectly, even on my black car. I wash the car, pull it into the garage, and quickly dry it with the Absorber. It requires almost no wringing, but I can easily wring the water out, when I need/want to.<br /><br />I'm very pleased!
B0009H520C|5|All comments are based my first eye detection. It's seems nice!<br />But it takes me more than 15 minutes to place it in my 2009 Ford Escape!
B0015PK3AG|3|I thought the product was kind of cheesy for the price. You must make sure it is on the housing perfectly or it will slip on the plastic flats. Once it is applied, was a bit difficult to remove off the housing, other than that, it works.
B00A6AS6LY|5|I suggest it, easy to use, etc, even with the shipping costs to New Zealand, it's still worth it, and based on EricTheCarGuy's channel on youtube, it probably lasts a good long time. :)
B004ZF39ZY|1|I purchased these lights they weren't as bright as everyone said they would be and within 2 days of them being installed the driver side light when out was very dissapointed with the product
B00JHEG8D8|5|Nice his kit came on time and a parfect fit.now my view is a lot better.
B0010DP45W|5|Not that hard to put in, saved over 200 bucks, working good.
B00DTL448Q|4|good quality and good price I like
B006PPM6CO|5|Works. Good price!
B005CD4MQS|3|I like these antenna toppers, and others have commented how cute they are.  But the four came crammed in a small mailing envelope, so one was crunched. After several months on the car the topper is fading.  But I guess I have three others when the first starts looking awful.  I attached this to my Forester antenna (the topper now smiles down on autos behind me) but it took some work:  I reamed out the existing small hole about halfway through the ball with a fat drill bit slightly smaller than the antenna diameter.  I then took a small button and some upholstery thread and attached the button to the top of the topper behind the sunrays where it doesn't show, dangling a length of thread through the reamed-out hole.  Then I attached a length of soft black electrical wire to the thread, and wrapped the wire the length of the antenna to anchor it from wind and thieves.  Overkill?  Probably, but the topper is still on my vehicle 6 months later.
B0083CIKKE|1|Couldn't get reception if I was outside the radio station<br />Shoulda made a donation to a &#34;GOOD&#34; cause!
B0040CZ7PM|5|Work great! Just be sure you order the right ones, I did and they work great!
B00IR90FZG|5|Excellent item. I like them
B0006O2PBW|1|seems nice because everybody knows how good BLACK ICE SMELLS heck i remember the first time i smelled black ice, i thought wow, this smells like regular ice, but is black. definitely a much stronger smell than unfrozen water or other colors of ice.  The reason for the one star however is because unfortunately having the air freshener turns out to be a bad idea in the winter - you can't smell the black ice coming up on the road, and everyone knows how hard it is to see. with the smell of black ice all around you, you're never gonna notice the smell of the ice on the road until it's too late.  DO NOT USE IN WINTER!
B007SKAKPU|5|was everything that i needed and is a valuable asset to my tool box. recommend this equipment to everyone who wants to have a &#34;heads-up&#34; on there vehicle diagnostics.
B00N1QBLCG|5|Fun
B005O0CXTM|3|These are good quality lights for being aftermarket. This is a Thai made part, higher quality than Chinese or Taiwanese parts. Taiwanese versions have lots of visual flaws, fit issues and lenses that fade and become hazy and chalky. The Thai parts come the closest to OEM Toyota quality compared to all of the aftermarket manufacturers.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of with these lights is the different bulb socket used on the amber signal. Using the sockets from the North American market trucks will only fit the clear marker/clearance light and will require alteration of the housing or use of a universal style socket in the amber signal repeater. No bulbs, wiring or hardware is included. I have yet to see how the plastic lenses hold-up to UV and how the color and clarity are affected. By appearances, just out of the box they look very good. After paying the price plus shipping it ends up costing nearly half of Genuine Toyota lenses (which come with bulb holders and short harnesses). However you can't order (Genuine Toyota) them through the USA dealer network.<br /><br />The physical fit into the fender is typically good with this brand and the chrome finish is good too.
B000C91FF8|5|Drop in replacement for secondary catalytic converter and associated piping for 2001-2004 Nissan Frontier with 3.3L V6
B00DX8BBRC|5|Bought for my 5 year old son, he loves the look and it fits him perfect
B00B7U6I12|4|Works great, took 3 weeks to get here. -1 star for poor delivery speed.
B009FUFCDQ|3|Not the same quality of the previous 30 that I bought from Amazon Basics.  The first purchase was Zwipes 85% Polyester, 15% Nylon a nice thick fluffy feel, the second purchase 90% Polyester, 10% Polyamide a noticeably thinner and less.<br />When I called Amazon they didn't know what Polyamide is and why the made the change.
B00139YMUQ|5|Accurate .nice on time
B000HVTERW|4|I got this because the hanger system built into my car could barely hold onto one hanger.  Definitely does the job although I have one criticism, the main hanger sometimes comes off the hook in my car (2006 VW Jetta).  It could be just my car but I fixed the problem by rubberizing the main hanger.  Not expensive (local hardware store) to do by any means and it fixed the problem 100%.
B003SOKEXI|5|Good. Popped right in and worked perfectly
B00K1C1WC2|3|These are great for light use and the bright color is a plus, they are at a good price.  I use these on a boat and small trailers on pretty flat pavement.  If you have a very large trailer or a very steep incline go to the heavier sets.  I saw a large camper that had crushed two of these in Alaska and went down a pretty big incline. If I remember correctly the red ones and the blue ones are different thickness and do not weigh much more. There is one company that makes a solid rubber one however it is like picking up a concrete block. The expandable brakes that go between the tires on a dual axel are probably great and lock for theft resistance but are a bit of a pain for short term use.   The guy that says he accidentally drove his tractor over one of the yellow ones and it did not smash must of been in mud.  Believe me these will smash, they will expand back a little afterwards but the integrity is pretty much gone. If they stand firm he would of certainly noticed when trying to drive over a good one on a hard surface as it would of been a good seat belt test on a tractor.  Next time you are in a pay per day camp ground ask if they have any as people drive off and leave chocks, hoses etc. all of the time.
B00603DSGO|5|This mount works great!! I would recommend this product.
B00032K3RA|2|This is pretty dumb why is there only one frame instead of two? I mean I would expect that to be common sense. There are two number plates on a car not one.<br />The quality is very good other than that.
B004SRRLPS|5|Everything went fast and smooth very happy
B000E8OV3U|5|Very well made shock for a ford truck.
B00INVEUFO|5|good product and fast service
B004J1F37G|5|Great product! finally a clutch that has a release bearing that fits my 2007 Nissan frontier 4.0 v6 6 speed manual transmission.
B001F0M7L4|5|all good
B009FUF6DM|5|Great deal, great product...glad I bought them
B00D8IQE4C|5|I love my hitch everything I wanted and was looking for gives my white and black truck that lil something to make it it's own
B005JCPJRI|3|Thought this product would last but shredded as soon as we tried to use it just pulling a small car out of the ditch...paid more money to have this toe strap but it just went to waste
B001D1OPPG|5|Huge, very heavy when full. I didn't use the trailer hitch though, keeps coming off. Easier to use a strap trough the handle then attach to the underside of the hitch.
B009PDF7S8|5|well respected company, great product, great price what more can I say.<br />I bought these for a minivan and they look great on it. they were also very easy to install.
B0074OVNQ0|1|I order these lights thinking the LED would be an upgrade from stock. The design on these lights are made to fail. You have to use your OEM bulb sockets which cannot withstand the heat of the LED lights. The brake light on the passenger side burnt out in a little over a month. I returned the lights to get credit and the company \\"Movement Automotive\\" still has not credited my account and it has been over a month. I would recommend paying the extra money for the SuperLux LED tailights. They are much made with a higher quality and look much cleaner.
B009MFBE8G|5|I FALL IN LOVE AT THE MOMENT I SAW IT BEFORE I ORDER IT
B0084UK4D6|5|As always with weathertech products exact fit and great quality
B001F7CFGO|5|Fit fine on my 2003 350Z.  NOTE: Had to unhook battery for couple of hours for computer to completely re-learn settings. Before that, did clear engine lean code but it came back on after a few miles even though it was running fine. Unhooking battery did the trick (so far).
B0065KKXL0|5|excellent
B000R97782|5|Working most of the time alone on trucks, this tool is realy handy to lift and align big truck hoods.
B009MBPE6I|5|I haven't actually used this gun yet,  but it looks and feels like high quality.  Have an old DeVillbiss gun (like 30 years old) and it still works good, but wanted to upgrade to new technology.
B00BH0JVF2|5|Nice, safe. I wanted this kind of caps. They look nice on tyres and no worries about thefts.<br />Cons: Just a little bit hard to tighten safe pin.
B00I50553E|5|These worked perfect! Excellent quality with a great price.. They were easy to install as well~
B000FS3UHW|5|If you are building or restoring your automotive A/C system, this stuff is great.    The roll is huge.  Other places had rolls half the size for the same or higher price.    Shipped and delivered super fast.
B003UT3S6Q|5|Cleaning the wheels is my least favorite part of washing my car, and this product definitely makes it easier! Compared to budget cleaners like Meguiar, Black Magic etc, Sonax really works. For long neglected wheels, brown from brake dust, it does the job considerably better. Not quite a spray and rinse operation, it loosens the dust enough so that it can then be easily wiped down with a soft rag. Try that with the cheapo products - you will have a much harder time doing this.<br /><br />Sure, it costs a lot more per ounce, but until I find something that is as effective and costs much less, I think I'll be buying more of this stuff.
B0006GK5NA|4|When I left the pump running for a week, it lost its pumping capability. The replacement arrived quickly and was easy to put into place. Works great, just have to make sure to not go away for a week at a time.
B00700ZEMM|4|Good
B000AM8BPE|5|Been using this stuff for 5 years, I think it protects great. My 5 year old naked paint (stripped of wax with dish soap) was mistaken for post-buffed and waxed by several people. That's with the harsh salt of winter every year.<br />[...]<br />One tub lasted me most of the 5 years, re-ordering now.  This is typical hard paste, and needs to be applied appropriately lightly and wiped off quickly.
B00LNN3MRQ|3|This would probably be a good replacement of your spring is broken, but I felt zero difference with it installed over the factory spring.
B000IY8PAA|1|Seemed to have very well for 8 months and suddenly the clutch fan burned and caused the compressor to lock up.  So I am in process of replacing it with a new one.  Could have been simply a bad unit.  I thought of returning it to the seller but they stated that I would get parital payment for returning it, then I had to pay shipping for returning it and shipping for them sending me a replacements so the costs calculated to be about 60% of the cost.  I threw in the towel and bought one locally.
B005HYSLLO|1|It fell off at some point a few days after i put it on. It needs to come with lock washers. Im kickin myself because i know better. If you buy this product plan on addin lock washers.
B005BHCE24|5|This bag is huge, so be careful in choosing the size of Wolfman you go for:  This one may not fit exactly in the place you're thinking of putting it on the bike.  That said, if you know you need a high quality, waterproof bag, this will do you fine.  I suspect it will last forever.  It's roll-top style, which is what makes it waterproof, but also makes it difficult to access items.  You need to disconnect the bag from its tie towns, unroll the top, retrieve item, roll top back down, and reconnect bag to bike.  Use it as a secondary bag to access infrequently accessed items and you'll be set.  I did a 7 day, 4600 mile trip through the American SW with this bag last year, and it was large enough to hold all that I need.
B000C5E4ZU|2|Nowhere on the packaging does it state Dorman. Just bugs me to be victim of misrepresentation. Still not sure on fit but will update once installed.<br />Update: Took truck and part to shop, mechanic said part would serve me better in the trash. Let him order one and install it. Wish I had saved my money on this part.
B00CUK12GY|5|great looking tag , great colors , just right size<br />should look great on front of my blue ford truck
B000E4N1YY|5|I put this in my '99 Suburban and it was a perfect replacement for the original. With the help of a couple of YouTube Videos it was about a 45 minute project. Now it looks and works like new.
B002ZTK734|3|Everything was fine, but I received two of the same foot pegs, which means on my brake side the peg is backwards. Otherwise, eveything fit well and while I wouldn't consider myself a rookie, installation was pretty straight forward.    *Edit: Amazon was quick to send me replacement parts at no cost to me with next day shipping. Very impressed.
B00BFINC7E|5|I would like to say I give this product a five star rating. It looks great on the car and adds a touch of elegance to the automobile. Thank you for that assistance. However you need to send out instructions with these kits. That would save a lot of time for customers.
B00AS2E5VU|5|And these smaller sized sanitizers make it easy to tuck one in almost anywhere, which I appreciate. I've tried them all - this one and the vanilla are the best, IMHO.
B000KFKDW0|1|The unit is nice looking and fit nicely in my car. However after a couple of alignments, the unit continued to give erroneous reading especially while stopped at a traffic light. Perhaps the power lines were affecting it.    I have had 2 vehicles that had a compass built in and there was no erratic opertion with those units.     I returned the unit to Amazon.com and got a full refund. I was pleased with Amazon's service.  Tim Brown
B0010B00IA|5|Works as intend  for a cooler  I try to carry reusable &#34;ice&#34; on my 60 mile rd trip to the store and it keep my ice cream from melting
B005QZMWEQ|1|Bought these on rockauto. Now I have play in them after 15,000 miles.<br /><br />Yes they have grease nipples.
B00029WYVW|5|Good brand
B007O5GY0E|5|Product was just as presented, Well priced. Arrived and installed easily.
B000RFPQ16|5|Hit with reach, I love my air hammer and this just adds to where I can use it.
B00D9C2CDO|5|This item saved us so much time and space. Excellent product that I would recomend to anyone!
B00DP100HY|3|I like these sunglasses as they make colors &#34;pop&#34; when you're wearing them.  They're great for blocking the sun's rays.  HOWEVER...they always break above the right-side lens next to the nose piece.  There is obviously a defect in the plastic mold.  I have had 4-5 pairs break in the past couple of years and they always break in the same place.  Don't waste your time to super glue them back together; they won't hold!
B00Q7FJZT4|4|Slightly different than the stock coils . The  plug is at a lower angle which made some of the wire plugs hard to get on because it was facing obstructions instead of above them .  And the stem on the coil has a slight angle to it which made the bolt that holds the coil down harder to start one handed . Putting these coils in as a knuckle banging job and these slight differences then the stock coils made it even harder to do  . 2005 F150 , 5.4 engine . In for a week and running good .
B001F11ZQQ|5|Great product I have been using this LED for years.  Great quality and not those cheap LED lights you get from China
B005VNM1EO|4|The quality of this genuine Toyota product is a must if you plan on keeping your vehicle. I have tried aftermarket replacement products that did not last due to the cheap plastic. I even replaced my door handle several times before I wised up and bought this one. This is very expensive for a simple door handle which accounts for the only con I have with it. Pay the extra money now and save yourself time and money later.
B00KI2QUSQ|5|Well its pretty much the exact same kit as sinister diesel etc, and i dont know who made these kits first, but so far it works great. Wont have to worry about flash boiling the coolant. Smoother transition for the air into the intake. Maybe slightly better mileage and cooler egts.<br /><br />I believe it took me around 6 hours to do this job. Im sure id be faster if I have to do it again, but there were times I was questioning my sanity and possibly my sexuality, im kidding on the last partHELL YEAH BRO, MY DIESEL IS CREATING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF TESTOSTERONE NOW, WITHOUT THE NASTY SIDE EFFECTS. I apologize. Product is great, good luck with the installation
B008AGDXRS|5|good
B00GKTZAHS|4|Well, they weren't what I'd expected. I thought they would be bigger. But I just didn't read the description good enough, I guess. When they first arrived, there was only 8. I contacted them & they sent me 12 more of the correct ones. The sheet of 12 were much smaller than the sheet of 8. I can't really use them as I had intended. But they aren't horrible. Just would recommend if you want to put them on your vehicle, get bigger ones! Unless, it's on a license plate or you want it small.
B00EJFH6YA|4|Good lights, fairly bright , but no harness? good thing I know how to wire in harnesses. Fits perfectly in pushbar also, also easy to adjust the beam angle
B0081K3ORM|5|good quality....looks great on the back window
B00752TROG|1|Was not packaged very well. Glass was broken
B003EOZMX4|5|This was recommended to me by a very helpful BBK tech they are very nice and will work perfectly for my built be sure to double check that these are the proper size for your application..if so dont hesitate they are well made and priced even better!
B00076QA4C|5|Yes, the cargo net works, I just need a better glue to stick the holder to the side of the cargo space.
B00NBEV08S|5|This Toyoa tail light was shipped so quickly. It fit perfectly and was installed in about ten min
B001CF1A6U|5|Good
B00IR3NB5S|4|great price and matches exactly what i had on my 3.0L Mercruiser
B000JZ9T4O|1|This is a good part but is a knock off AC delco.  They are not selling you the same quality delco part you will get with the same part number on it from a gm dealer.  I know this for a fact because I have worked at a gm dealership for 26 years and still work there and have repaired so many of the vehicles using this exact part number . The delco parts Amazon is selling are frauds.  The hvac delco parts Amazon is selling are fakes not even clones.  They aren't even made to the sane measurements as the oem parts.  Quality of the Amazon delco condensers are the worst I have ever seen out of any cheap chain parts store brand.
B00G3Z3TMM|5|simple to install and great price!!
B0082122I2|3|The wiring harness for power supply is not compatible for the SC-901 head unit in my C70 despite description. Had to run to Best Buy to get a separate wiring harness so I could get power. The pin cable was an easy fit though.
B000P7O5DG|2|I bought this adapter to go with the Wagon Heated Seat Cushion. It does not fit tightly enough into the seat plug. I have to keep reinserting it. I bought the cushion because of back pain and I need the heat to be steady. The plug from the seat fits nicely into the car outlet so I know it is the adapter that isn't working properly
B009F10S3Y|5|Easy to apply works and looks great
B004FDY27K|3|It may be my phone, or it may be this device, but I could not remain connected to it for more than 5 minutes, and the max volume is WAY too quiet to be of any use while on the move, unless you have a full fairing.
B000I8VLBG|5|Worked perfect on my 2006 Cummins. Plenty long to reach a convenient location out the front bumper. My truck was from Texas so it didn't have the cord but had the heater installed.
B0094CR094|5|Heavy duty plate, nothing cheap, The plate sits right and has nothing wrong with it. The rime stones dont fall either
B003VCELCW|5|Ever since I heard about them I have put fumoto valves on every vehicle I own, they make oil changes a lot less messy and a hell of a lot faster.
B002GISKFQ|5|Space saver, keeps my junk from moving around, and was super easy to install.  I got black thinking it would blend into the shadows under the seat but, in hind sight, I might have chosen a color to match my Rugged Ridge floor liners/mats.<br /><br />I have not yet tried the rifle storage option but that seems good and the parts for the rifle rack come with it.  After this deer season, I may need to update everyone on the use of the rack inserts, but that too seems logical and well made.<br /><br />Using this easily doubled (maybe tripled) the amount of junk I can store under my back seat and it stays put, stays clean, and stays organized.  I'm glad I spent the money and got one.  Love it.  C
B004Q3OEV8|5|this is the second set of these that I've had from this company and I really like them. easy to install and they look nice.
B007XE8C74|5|A Great product.
B000S2SKIY|5|Part worked perfectly
B00194ARD6|5|Excellent jacket , my 15 year old nephew loves this jacket. Very high quality, nice fit, great look. This was a great deal, especially for the price.
B001B423FO|5|good product
B001OMRD1M|1|Horrible quality this is less than (1) year old and it corroded, if I could give zero stars I would. Waste of money.
B00CMVB2NE|5|Great price for this coolant which is NOT readily available in stores.  This is a new coolant for Chrysler.
B000KPU8MK|5|the power probe 3 works as advertised. i have resolved no start issues with small engines in short time. repair accuracy 100% with no comeback nor repeat issues. this product really saves time...
B00J56WTXQ|5|Great price and quality and color was a perfect match.
B00G9CGLWY|5|Great summer jacket! I'm sure the liner works well in the winter too.
B000NU3T3W|5|perfict
B000CB7BAY|5|I ordered this wiper blade for a toyota rav4 2006 and it just fit perfect.<br />It looks exactly like the factory wiper blade and installs in less than a minute.
B003REP8PI|5|These rubber mats are exactly what I was looking for my girlfriends car. She is a huge Pens fan. They work great and she is happy w them.
B004MSYQBU|5|Zackly what the doctor ordered!!! Will do what I need.
B00IO1ABB0|1|You need to change the pictures or be more clear. I thought I was getting 5 keychains. Disappointed cause I didn't even get to pick the one I wanted then.
B00480N104|2|Bought and installed in my car in March 2014 and in October 2014 (7 MONTHS) one lamp is already dead. Limited night driving and no daytime running lights so minimal usage resulted in a quick burnout. Call me unimpressed.
B00ICR1UB6|5|Good product, received on time and works as advertised.
B00K7YI808|5|bueno
B002UPOX9M|5|F350 6.4L:<br /><br />Used this between my exhaust and transmission lines where during regen was exposing lines to very high temps and causing my transmission temps to rise.<br /><br />Placed this over the exhaust and strapped on using stainless steel ties and the temp was almost gone to where the lines are very close to the exhaust.
B00DTNYWNQ|1|Ordered twice and received yellow and black gloves both times! I would Not order these, as you will not get these gloves!
B004W900GE|5|Look great!!
B000C7QHR6|5|Exact fit easy install
B0006H938M|5|Works great, I like the taller height. And better flush than the original.
B00480KOP4|5|These did the trick to replace the stock H11 bulbs and provide brighter low-beam illumination for my 2007 Honda Pilot.  I had to remove a tab from these with a dremel (google for instructions if that's why you're looking at these), but they've been providing a nice bright light at a cheap price with no problems for several months now.  So cheap, twice as bright, and since the pilot has projector style beams, doesn't blind oncoming drivers.  WAY better!
B006GJKNYW|5|okay
B00K7930TC|1|the rivets did not stay on, they fell off and its gone now :{
B0024E6QX0|5|Fit perfect. Works great. Keeps all like out.
B008H08LQU|5|Super bright for the money..put them in my integra and they light up everything. I got them fast and that came from China. From order to house 5 days..ordering more for my wife's car....love them...
B003PI5WNY|5|Very well built nice paint bolted up very easy.
B00GXJIZ5Y|4|works great for an 2005 Arctic Cat 500 TRV
B001CF1Y0C|5|May only be rated at 8,800 lbs, but it sure does work and if you add a snatch block you can almost double your pulling power.<br /><br />With out a snatch block, I used this winch to pull down a seventy foot tree and I only had about forty feet of line out.  I couldn't believe how much force it had to pull that tree down with having so little line out.
B001R9UTJ0|5|I live in San Diego and ride 365 and it doest really get that cold but this is great for keeping your face a little warm as well any insects from your mouth.  Its light enough to ride on hot days too. After a while it stretches out but if you throw it in the wash comes out like new again.
B00T53VFWU|5|Very satisfied with the product.
B0046I72PS|5|not only was my remote old but I'm getting there as well. I am happy to push the buttons again and not have to wonder what button does what, ha ha  good job and thanks.
B00NN4UTVK|5|would say this product is an absolute must-buy simply for its ease of accessibility. It detects problems with my car without me having to spend hundreds on outside source detection and repair. This also saves time. I also appreciated that its codes were USB transferable to a computer device. I would argue it's the quintessential OBD scanner on them market.
B0009TPX7M|5|fit perfect.
B000GZO6M2|4|This windshield was supposed to fit a Suzuki S-40. It does but not very well. I had to modify it on the band saw to get a really good fit. It is a good quality windshield, looks nice and has great wind protection. My wife loves it.
B001UFZC1G|5|Got this sticker for my fiance's tool box and he loved it. All of his co-workers are jealous and asked him if he could order them some.
B002E5DT1G|5|Great
B00B2I27ZK|4|The tailgate Handle cover is very attractive,looks nice on my truck but I installed it on a rainy day and almost lost it not sufficient tape
B0024GIWDK|1|Its too tight, I ordered this one after measuring my head size but it didn't match the spec.
B001V371HA|5|Great product with fast shipping
B002ANU68Q|5|Great. Just what I wanted.
B00T2G2L1Y|1|Bases did not fit into PC74 socket for Jeep/Mopar instrument cluster.  Heads of LED are too large to fit through the hole in the back of the instrument cluster.
B00BMU96CA|3|I originally ordered a smaller size, which turned out to be the wrong size, and tuningpros were great in their communication and shipment of an exchange. These were the hubcaps I got in exchange. They could be a few mm larger, as 1 flew off the first time I drove my car after installing them.<br /><br />So far the other 3 have stayed on, so hopefully it was just an off size on the 1.
B00OZ42J4C|4|I purchased this for my 2000 Grand Marquise.  wrong, it doesn't fit the windshield completely, but  enough that I can see.  The elastic freezes to the body of the car when it gets that cold.  I concerned about theft as my car is in outside parking lot.  Overall it can use it,  I have just purchased another one for my daughter who stands 5' even, and when she has to clean off windshield she can't reach.  So this will be a Godsend I I can just keep in on her car. for more than a week.  She lives in an area that is a little shady. So I know that I'll probably be buying another one soon.  It would b e nice if this could b e  fixed about thieft and straps freezing. maybe lining the strap with a stretch fabric that dosen't stick to metal.<br />4 stars
B002BQJC0K|5|Very  good value. The gloves are comfortable and fit well. ( I ordered XL which is my normal glove size, and these fit perfectly.) Since it is now August and I am in Tennessee I cannot state how warm they are in cold weather, however I am confident they will be fine. If you are looking for a pair of affordable winter gloves for motorcycling, skiing, ect. I would highly recommend these.
B00CWMRZEI|3|Harley brand lower fairings cost around $500.  These are only $84..!  That should tell you something.<br />I purchased the lower fairings plus the “TMS” quick release mounting hardware.  The fairings look just like the ones I've seen on my friend's Harley.  The plastic does seem a little thinner than the HD brand but nothing serious.  The fairings came disassembled with out any assembly hardware nor instructions.  I ended up checking “YouTube” for independent videos on how to assemble the fairings.  Other than a little “trial & error” selecting screw types and sizes, there were no major problems assembling the fairings (using YouTube videos as a guide).<br />Mounting the fairings on the bike (06 HD Electra Glide Classic) was a bit time consuming.  The fairings were loose fitting on the case guard.  So, I ended up using pieces of a bicycle tube around the case guard to take up the slack.  It took a while to find the right amount to use in order to make the fairings fit tight and solid.  (btw:  I did read other reviews before I bought.  So, I wasn't too surprised by these problems.)<br />After two days of aggravation, frustration and “trial & error”, I finally got them installed and they look great..!  They are solid on the bike and unless you knew better or did a close inspection, you would never suspect that they are aftermarket.<br />Bottom Line:  A real bargain but be ready for some aggravation..!
B003G0S9YA|3|it's a little hard than what i expect, but its nice floor liner, easy to clean and it fit good.
B0006IX7X8|5|I have used camco products for years when rving and they are top quality.  Even though these are for the cupboard, I am using them in the freezer compartment of a side by side refrigerator to increase food storage space and keep  the frozen items from falling out.  The rubber feet are smother than the ones meant for the refrigerator but stlll work great.
B003CJHBBM|5|I used this steering stem bearing kit to replace that on my son's 2004 PW80.  It's a great fit and the bearings are much higher quality than the stock ones that were in there.  I'll buy from All Balls again.
B003VARMGG|1|This can't be installed in any door thicker than about 1/4&#34;  as the lock won't fit into the hole due to the right angle of the latch which isn't removable.
B00FRHOMNM|4|One of the best rated wipers. Really cleans fast. But... I have noticed after a couple of months that sometimes one side come unclipped when I lift the arm to clean the window, the clip comes apart. IMPORTANT note, that is the first time this has happened in 3 sets on 3 different vehicles. So still reliable.
B0068EU46C|5|Very nice piece.  Nobody else around here has one.  Just the way i like it.
B000C34KYC|5|I frequently look towards aftermarket vendors whenever it comes time to replacing something on my car, but still want OEM performance and durability or better. This Gatorback belt I hope will live up to its claims because the cross-hatch design really does make a lot of sense for decreased heat which will add to its longevity.<br /><br />I had a squeal whenever I would start up the car in the morning, and now that squeal has disappeared. The engine is also more responsive, something that I can't quite put in words but its something you can definitely feel while driving. I can't contribute this to the product itself as I needed a belt replacement regardless.<br /><br />No problems with fitment.
B00LO0M918|5|Awesome had to flip some of them over but worked excellent.
B00080QHMM|4|handy, easy to read
B00ITC7536|1|Garbage. It arrived without the shunt. Garbage.
B00335HQRY|4|Excellent front coverage and protection.
B001P2CYRY|5|I got these clamps to replace the OEM radiator clamps on my 2004 Subaru WRX.<br /><br />They are absolutely perfect. They look nice and tighten beautifully. And no leaks!<br /><br />Word of caution:  I hear it is very easy to crush the plastic fittings on the OEM radiator with t-bolt clamps, so only use these if you have an all metal aftermarket radiator.
B000C11JFM|5|Excellent quality and works very well. Great price, promptly shipped, and easy to read instructions. Look on Youtube for videos.
B0082LK5ZO|5|works like magic !
B000C55Y0Y|5|Everything looks to be well made from quality materials. Fit and went on with no problems.
B000N9R0UG|1|This did not fit my motor as advertised.
B00F8PMIYI|5|Very impressed with the quality of the hub assembly I received. It was shipped quickly and my questions were promptly answered by the seller. When I need more parts, I'll not hesitate to choose Callahan.
B0016HPUS8|5|All Ok Good Seller
B000LY9GZ0|4|Installed this on my 2006 Ridgeline<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Looks great!<br />- Makes the truck look tougher<br />- Somewhere to put some small 4&#34; LED bars<br />- Use for bump gates<br />- Some protection from running over brush<br />- Light weight<br />- Comes with extra splash guard plastic buttons<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Unclear instruction for install<br />- This bumper is a light duty so do not expect to pull a stuck truck out from it.<br />- Have patients when cutting the splash guard plastic<br /><br />Overall great product and took about 2 hours to install. I would recommend this to other Ridgeline owners!
B005XARUCI|5|Was super easy to apply to my window!
B005NLQAHS|5|High quality! Syncs each time.
B001TLITTI|1|Very low quality said it fits and didn't
B009DJZDR4|5|Perfect fit and color
B00AAYG6EU|5|These lights are bright! They have the perfect blue hue I was looking for. Quality product. Will be buying again.
B004NVA7SW|5|product meet my expectations greatly and was easy to install, did not have any problems and they are working great.
B000VT0I16|5|Wow blazing fast shipping. I got them Monday and wasn't due untill Wednesday. My husband put them on my Nitro in about 10 minutes they look great!!
B00N1TRFJQ|5|perfect!!!!
B000JFNAK8|5|works great if you have newer car and going to work on it you need these
B00GS4EXLY|5|Worked great as a replacement ballast when one on my wifes car went bad. No flickering, easy plug and play, very high quality!
B00GHUFZAW|5|Worked great for my car, and inexpensive.
B007TYBP3G|3|one of the lights where the bulb goes in was siliconed to hold it in place. other than that they are very nice
B002G3G0Y4|5|Great quality and easy to install. Best price too.
B000WJA5ZY|4|I had originally bought this to mount on my jeep dash but it is to heavy and was lifting the dash cover from the weight so I bought the 4 inch one and it is perfect. I still give it 4 stars because my husband wanted one for his truck so I just bought the suction base for the windshield and a x grip.
B006X27RF0|1|see what happens when you buy cheap junk? You send it back. don't buy this unless you own a moped.
B001J8U91C|5|Good riser height for standing up on my XR650L (I'm 6').  Gives the impression of being plenty beefy, though haven't put it through the ringer yet (it did survive one low speed digger just fine)
B008900BRU|2|I purchased these for my jk after installing a lift to help with driveshaft/exhaust crossover problem.<br /><br />On my previous jk I had the teraflex spacers.<br />I figured they must all be the same so I ordered these rugged ridge ones.<br />The install is always a bit of a pain getting the exhaust to work with you, but as with the teraflex, decent instructions were included.<br />Now when I put the spacers in and used the supplies hardware I realized the bolts were too long, and possible a different thread size.. They would not thread nicely and I would have needed 3 or 4 extra washers under each bolt to make it work. Unacceptable. I went out and bought my own hardware that would work.<br />Product works, but should have just gone with the teraflex kit. I didn't have any problems with teraflex.
B003K20JXI|5|love it keeps my coffee hot
B00BJ8FED0|3|Smelled awful when I first got everything. I've had it for about a year and it's pretty matted down. I wouldn't buy this again but it was great while it lasted.
B000GHJCLK|3|The new roof fit fine, but within a few weeks of installing it, it started getting mildew spots on the outside. Our white top is now speckled with black spots that don't seem to wash off.. So, if that bothers you.. either choose a different top, or get a black one that doesn't show it.
B001KZDRYK|5|Been working on getting my 02 jetta 1.8t road ready for over a year. decided to take a chance and look online and found it. less than half of what dealer was asking and the exact same part! fits perfect. thanks
B007NNH1V8|5|Made modification to dust cover like I was told in other reviews and it works great.  Glad I bought it
B007XWU54E|5|This is the best bag for buck, sounds good and price was as good as it gets.  Would definitely recommend and or purchase again!
B00JIEX722|5|Yes Extremely BRIGHT.. Enough said.
B0042Z0E6E|5|This mat is fantastic! Looks good. Dries quickly. The first time we used it we had a thunderstorm and it was dry in no time. We packed it up in it's bag and 2 weeks later when we checked it,  it was fine. Highly recommended!
B001Q1UT1W|5|all you need. place and press easy to clean floor and it doesn't move
B00R609GW0|5|great item
B0066COASY|1|Horrible!!! Doesn't not work in the least bid. I'd give it negative stats if I could. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
B005POFVB4|5|FABULOUS PRODUCT!  This product really lasts a long time.  I applied only one application to 3 different automobile tires. they all held up very nicely.  Traded in one of the autos so I put a coat on the new one too.  While I was at it I applied a second coat to the other two.  The tires look GREAT.  I have already purchased another bottle so I will be ready to do this again when the first bottle runs out.
B0052FRW2W|5|The door handle color matches very well and works perfectly!  This is much cheaper than getting it from the auto mechanics.
B000CGGHDG|4|Installing this was a &#34;three handed job&#34; but I was able to get it done and it does not leak.  After dealing with a leak for a couple of years I got tired of the car dotting my garage floor - no problems now.  Thanks.
B002P8SMDW|4|Was very easy to install on to my 2003 Honda Accord. Mirror works great.  There is a little vibration at Highway speeds but not very much so it is still easy to see out of while on the highway.  The mirror itself gives a larger viewing area then the OEM part.
B00QV4IB1E|3|Comfy
B005LTIU9S|5|All a/c techs should have one replace schrader valves with no loss of freon. Simple and great 4 the environment as well as cost of going through the expense of loss freon
B00J39IT0C|5|It was the exact same key remote I needed for my hhr. It was cheaper than me going through the Chevrolet place.
B007GR5D3O|5|had the battery for 4 months. It works wonderfully;  is light; and powers my Vulcan 900 LT very well.
B00EC0Y7GM|5|Perfect fit! Easy replacement.
B004ROMJIQ|5|Adding the valve caps for my Hyundai Sonata was a nice finish to my car. The mini wrench is helpful in securing it so that it makes it difficult to remove the valve caps unless you have the wrench. I always tighten them to the point where you would need the wrench to remove them, plus it also serves as a deterrent for potential thieves.
B000BUU5TU|1|I cannot stress enough that you should not buy this product.  It is defective.  You stand a small chance of getting one that works out of the box, but you should be aware that something with this level of quality cannot be expected to work for any given amount of time.  It also requires you to drill a hole in your black tank which is a heavy commitment for a product that will surely fail.<br /><br />Even after reading quite a few bad reviews on here I decided to hope for the best and ordered this product. I really wanted it to work. It is a good idea and could easily be made to function as advertised, but it does not. It is manufactured with with the same attention and care as something you would expect to find in a dollar store.  This item would be a good value at the dollar store, if you only bought it for the hose and tossed the actual rinser in the trash right away.  They have spent much more time on the packaging than the actual item.<br /><br />I am so glad that I took the warning of others and tested the rinser before drilling a hole in my black tank.  I attached it to a garden hose and turned it on gently. Water went everywhere but where you would expect it too.  Every seam sprays water. It does not spin, only leaks badly.  A small amount of water came out of the two jets but it did not compare to the amount that was coming of the joint below it.  The unit eventually separated from the supplied hose and shot off about 5 feet onto the ground. I packed it up and returned it.<br /><br />If you are the manufacturer and you are reading this I hope you are ashamed of your product.
B003BVWK5I|3|Price was okay and so was the product.
B00C5AK224|4|It works on 2.0 Jetta.  No engine light so far.
B0055FJSFI|4|This kit is a very standard HID kit.  For beginners and enthusiasts on a budget, this kit is definitely worth the $50.  We got the 8000K lights for my wife's 1996 Dodge Intrepid.  Install was slightly confusing since the install manual only showed how to properly connect the bulbs to the ballast... and no mounting instructions.  However, we figured it out, and install didn't take very long.  These things are bright.  No doubt, they are HID lights.  Distance, density, and spread are all 5 stars in my book.  The only downside to these is that they take a little longer to charge when you first turn them on.  So, we turn the engine on, turn on the lights, fiddle with our android phones, and viola.  Charge only takes around 10 seconds.
B0051BW1J6|4|Arrived in great time, looks good. Haven't installed it yet.
B001LQJAOY|5|Great price. Swapped  very easily.
B009HK235O|5|Extremely durable, perfect fit and works great!
B00FB7XH6Q|5|Buy this kit. As those of us in the VW business/hobby know... when it comes to Engine Gaskets kits, all kits are NOT created equal. The kit I received was the very best you can buy anywhere at any price. It was the German made Elring kit. These kits contain the very best pushrod tube seals in existence (they are white in color, those &#34;reddish/orange&#34; ones that the other companies' kits include dry up and leak within a year or so). This kit is not one of those cheap and low quality kits made in China or Brazil; again it is German. Since it supplied to equip all of the 1300, 1500, and 1600cc air-cooled engines it will contain pieces that will not be used (an added bonus to be stored and saved just in case you can use them for something). It is for both single port (with the 34mm O.D. crush seals or the 38mm O.D. crush seals where the cylinder head and intake manifold meet, both are included) and dual port engines. Many additional yet typical gaskets and seals are included.<br />  I have been a &#34;VW nut&#34; since 1982. I have owned an import auto repair shop specializing in the big four German marques since 1995. I have literally assembled at least 100 VW air-cooled engines in that time. Trust me, you will not be disappointed with this kit.<br />  If you are working on a 1200cc VW air-cooled engine, again most of this kit will work for you too. In fact, I will be using this gasket/seal kit to assemble an December of 1965 engine with in the next few days. I have already checked, everything I will be needing is included.<br /><br />Hopefully this helps you decide on which kit to purchase.
B000Q7XMSE|2|Does NOT fit for 2nd row with just 2 seats. Great, now I have to pay to ship it back.  I must have missed where it says it does not fit that.
B0076QWJDM|5|Easy to install. Quality made. It did take awhile to get here but happy with purchase. Would recommend this product.
B00WP0YLM6|5|Good for detering burglars
B004L439FE|4|worked good
B000C5J1OO|5|Ordered this after messing up the Timken I waited TWO MONTHS for from my local parts store.  This got here in LESS THAN A WEEK from Amazon and it was a better deal than the Timken for a few reasons;<br /><br />1. The Timken costs around $90 at the parts store, this is a better deal.<br />2. The installation cup was a little thicker and better on this.<br />3. The instructions were better on this.<br />4. You can remove the installation flange(the rounded portion on the back) on this after you have it on, I don't remember that being an option on the Timkin, (not 100% sure that you can't on the timkin, but 100% you can if you want to on this one.)<br /><br />Mainly I'm just kind of kicking myself for waiting 2 months for the first one from the local parts house.  I put this on the rear main oil sealing surface of the crankshaft of a 1994 Chevrolet 6.5L Turbo Diesel.
B007NYZ4F2|5|Seems like good quality parts.  Installed perfectly.  You will need a press to be able to install the hub into this, or you will need to pay someone to press the parts for you.
B007Z755KQ|5|Paid $132.00 with Prime and it arrived in 2 days.  There was no damage to the box or contents and there were no missing parts.  Everything was in new condition.  The bars fit perfectly on our 2014 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport 4-Door.  In regard to the installation, don't tighten down the brackets to the frame initially as you'll need some wiggle room to properly align and set the bar to the bracket.  The finish is a somewhat shiny and I think it looks sharp on our white Jeep.  I took a couple pictures after installation and have added them to the customer image gallery for this listing.
B0002SRCKG|5|Hammer it in the old seal, pull it out! I've replaced half a dozen oils seals with this tool.  Sure beats a  screwdriver
B000BWDUMM|3|I purchased the Accel 8132 cap and rotor. The CAP fit my '94 Suburban, but the Rotor didn't. I had to go buy another rotor locally. Amazon was very accommodating and refunded me the cost of the second rotor. That was great. Amazon did offer me a full refund of the set plus they offered to pay my shipping costs, but I had installed the cap and didn't want the hassle of removing it. I think Amazon offers Excellent customer service!
B004GCZFVW|5|Great fit perfect
B00K0VMXDQ|5|This a great product.  Perfect for everything it does.  Highly effective and easy to use.  Every vehicle should have one.
B001TXWNLQ|5|I love these!<br />They are very handy to have on hand.  In fact, I keep one in my car at all times in the event I am traveling and forget my charger at home.  I can then use this with my car charger and whala!
B009P0QGRM|5|It was so easy to install. Very simple and quick. Works like a charm. Would highly reccommend to any one for camping, tailgaiting or any where you need portability. Very light weight.
B003UM7B98|5|This jack is excellent.  It's small, and has a low profile, to get into hard to reach  places, and it's very strong.  I liked it so much, I bought another one.  The two jacks make rotating tires a snap.  If you tinker with cars/trucks, this is an excellent jack  to have.    Update: As of 9/23/14, I now own three of these jacks.
B001A5SQJ6|4|Fits my CaymanS not perfect but well enough to get the job done.
B00CC2ZYCS|5|HIDs or LEDs? My truck has a full interior led conversion. All of my friends have HIDs and simply hate that they do. They are always having problems with theirs. Yes it looks nice and sometimes I get jealous. So I decided to buy from OPT7. You will not regret it. I have not had any problems with them and the 6k is the perfect color. I get compliments and questions from everybody. &#34;How come they haven't messed up yet?&#34; I always reply, &#34;That's what happens when you buy from the best.&#34; They are bright and amazing.
B007QBOVW4|3|did not fit my vehicle, electrical connection is different from original, wires have to be spliced.
B000C8NTUI|5|Fit Perfectly , great quality.<br /><br />A few tips.... First, On 2001 Ford Explorers make sure you have the 5 Speed Automatic Transmission. This will not fit the 4 Speed model.<br /><br />Second.... The night before the install lay the gasket flat and put a large phone book on it over night. This will make it much easier to install if it is flat.
B0041CADZU|5|I'm a year in and it's great.  Also great customer service
B0018ICAMO|5|met all expectations
B000F1698Q|3|It's good for the price.I had to velcro it down in alot of areas.Doesn't fit as well as I thought but it'll keep the sun off the dash and that's good enough for me,for now.
B0040UAVOG|5|Delervery time was good would recommend to others I just taped mine to storm door to worn others lol
B002FDISWW|5|I installed it in less than 10 minutes. now my hand and arm do not hurt after 10 minutes of riding.
B005QDPJD4|1|Just bought from amazon.com, arrive just in time but when i compare at the pivot website, i found that my pivot raizin is a fake one.<br />How come amazon send me the fake pivot?
B000CQI2E8|3|I ordered this for my 1996 Ford F250 Regular cab pickup with bench seat because my truck has no storage or cup holders. The product appears to be built fairly well and the materials look durable, but it doesn't fit very well into my truck.  It would work nicely in a truck where the seat in not as deep as mine.  There are lots of nice little cubbies to keep stuff, but I was surprised to find out that the large back portion could not hold standard 8.5 x 11 documents.  A portion of the back compartment is filled with plastic dividers and a pen holder.  So other than the clipboard area on the cover, there is no place for documents.  Not well thought out for a &#34;Contractor&#34; console.
B003PJRBZ0|2|This was not what I wanted. I am waiting to see if I get my refund. Curt was not helpful with my questions.
B0015D4ZH0|3|This is a strong winch,just be careful it jumped the spool on me and I had to remove take apart and repair .Now I keep my eeyes on the spool while winching.
B00IA9XWSU|4|Looks good.  Reasonable price. Still can't figure out where its made.
B00029J3KW|5|I used a pair of these to replace the stock resonators on my custom '09 Pontiac G8 exhaust setup.  These completely eliminated cabin drone.  Also, in addition to my previous mods(mid-muffler replaced with X-pipe / stock axle backs swapped out with Magnaflow 11225's), this increased exhaust flow and resulted in more low to mid rev-range torque.  Highly recommended to all!
B00GHT6SF4|5|Perfect fit and finish
B001KS8NWI|5|These filters were designed for the higher pressure ZR1, but will work on any of the Gen 6 Corvettes.  Much cheaper here than at my dealer.
B0041CC89O|5|cant beat them for the price
B00KNFJUGW|5|Fits quite well and looks good.
B003YK96YO|5|This step is great. It still works as good as new. Others rust and stiffen up. Well made no wobble or looseness
B006RYVULG|5|excellent!!!
B000N9OE1E|5|For heavy oxidation this is the best!
B001C90XQE|5|Well it was bound to happen sooner or later, the brake pads on my 2006 Forester were worn and the car would shudder when I would apply the brakes on the freeway. It was time to replace my brakes.  The naturally aspirated \\"Fozz\\" as it's affectionately called, is not a high-performance vehicle nor am I a racer.  So I basically wanted a set of brake pads that have a good reputation for build quality, longevity and daily driver performance without breaking the bank.  I purchased the EBC Ultimax brake pads for the front and a set for the rear (UD1004). When the package arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find out that EBC included noise abatement shims which you peel off and attach to the back of the pad. The friction side of the pad is coated with a red 'Brake-In'layer which helps to remove deposits from your existing rotors.  The coating basically scrubs the junk off your rotors and preps the surface, so that the new brake pads have a cleaner surface to 'bite' against.  Working on a Forester is very easy and this brake installation was no different.  After bedding the pads, I took her out for a spin and was very impressed by how quiet the brakes were and the initial bite, which was very aggressive.  The performance of these pads is better than OEM, however the brake dust left on the wheels was slightly more than the original pads. I did not have to smear any brake quiet grease on the back of the pads.  After 2,500 miles, of panic stops, stop and go traffic and freeway driving, these pads have exceeded my expectations and I would heartily recommend them.    P.S. I also upgraded the front rotors to Centric Premium Brake Rotor (120.47018) and the rear rotors to Centric Premium Brake Rotor (120.47011).
B00FEAOMQE|5|Great for price
B001TXWNLQ|5|saves lots of time.  works great.  never have charging issues or electricity issues since purchasing this adaptor.  does not get hot, does not cause any issues
B00MB86T4K|1|It worked properly for 2 days.  Then started running full force all the time, making a roaring sound constantly.  Sent it back for a refund.
B00A9OCO4M|5|Everything I expected. Easy to install. Works well and looks good.
B00DCR7TN4|4|Perfect fit on 2005 MINI Cooper Convertible.  2 minutes replacement job.  Signal strength is good if not ever so slightly better than the factory model it replaced, at 1/3rd the length.  Looks great.  Materials of good quality.
B00DZIB9GS|4|Cleans as expected
B000CAINEI|5|Works as described.
B00B2QEVHE|5|got them yesterday and they're amazing! havent put the bench seat ones on in the back yet (need to vacuum dog fur out first) but they look great, fit my corrolla s (newer model) just fine. Had a bit of room in the seats but that was expected. they look JUST like the picture. Super excited.
B0040TE3XW|5|their awesome
B0031HY8E8|5|This product was a great replacement headlight for my 2004 Ford Expedition.  Shipped and arrived on time.  It came with everything you need to install right into your vehicle (already installed on assembly).  The only reason I replaced my factory lights was due to the small pings from driving back and forth from the east to the west coast.  It took me less than 20 minutes to remove and replace both of my headlights.  This headlight brings back the \\"NEW\\" factory look to my Ford Expedition.  I would buy this product again without hesitation!
B000ELFMV2|5|This wheel cover was a challenge to install because one must stitch it in place. The key to a good installation is pulling the string really tight, which can be hard on the hands. Also, the string is wax-covered and tangles easily. Once it is on, though, it looks beautiful. Really professional looking because of the leather quality and the stitching. It comes in many colors and the sea blue was really a great color. I had to return the first one because I ordered the wrong color, but they were really nice about the exchange.
B002UYWH1O|5|I purchased my rear floor mats, trunk mat and storage holder for my new Mini Cooper Clubman from Amazon. Excellent service and fast delivery.
B00IO943MA|1|Cheap material , They make noise,  squeal, and make wheel very dirty , I replace the pads after 3 weeks for a better quality pads.
B007AL4W4M|5|Plug and play on my 2012 Tundra
B00F5MUB66|5|Best camper shower ever.
B0096BH6X8|1|I dont like it . It came off while I was driving .
B004QUDYP8|5|These chains make it possible to mow my lawn in spots I could not before. They give me the traction on hills so that my tires don't spin out.  I have a common size riding lawnmower that probably uses the same size tires across all the brands - Craftsman, Husqevarna, John Deere, etc. I also purchased some bungee clips so that the chains would fit tight on my tire and not wear the rubber down as quickly. I would highly recommend for anyone with traction problems.
B006OQ35GU|5|Want to know your tanks are clean? This works as advertised. Until I can get my wife to do it, like that is going to happen...
B00GQRTQE2|4|Great! !!
B000636OW4|5|I installed laminate flooring in my new home and have tried every recommendation for cleaning it, all of which left a residue and/or did not clean well. I had a can of 848 Plastic Cleaner by Sprayway I decided to use and it works like a charm, no residue and it just eats up spills and other unmentionables; I have two cats. I highly recommend this product which was originally intended to clean lucite products but works well on glass and other hard surfaces. I had to buy a case of 12, but that will last me a very long time. Thanks, Sprayway for manufacturing this product!
B00EN9ZX88|5|My motor cycle now stops
B004I36GU8|5|Light was easy to install with no tools required.  Looks identical to factory installed light it replaced.
B0042C5BPQ|5|The perfect replacement for my scratched up original emblem badge piece on my older BMW car! Thanks for making this available to me.
B0009V1WSE|1|Hitch coupler lock fell apart after a months use. Lock cylinder fell out of lock.
B008XCUX0E|3|I bought two of these. One worked perfectly. One did not work. Given the low price and ease of return I would judge this quite a bargain. Name brand instrument of the same type are over $100.
B00PT18QAQ|4|Decent gauge.  I would recommend making the tip a little deeper.  It would help guide this gauge to the valve stem for better connection.  You have to be at a correct angle when making a reading otherwise air would just leak out.
B000VHM19A|5|Great Fit!!!! I play basketball and flag football and it fits comfortably.. i would recommend for anyone that is having shoulder problems like me.
B001O216WE|1|The valve caps were too short for my valve stem, and have some type of weird light reflector in the end. In 'short', not worth the price.
B000E9C21M|5|Awesome product
B0000BYEXO|5|Great battery.  This puts an end to any leaky battery fluid in my jets ski.  I plan to replace all of the conventional wet, open cell batteries in my jet skis with these.  It also turned the starter at near full speed when the charge was down to 10%.  I hadn't used the ski for a couple of months and allowed the battery to slowly discharge.  It started right up.  I then checked the battery condition with the battery charger and determined the low charge status.  I was very impressed.  Good purchase.
B004G7QGCE|5|I put this on my Infiniti G35 coupe, replacing the stock knob. The weight of the knob feels great, and the finish is beautiful. Did not need to use the locking nut that was supplied with the knob, but some applications might call for it. High quality product, I definitely recommend.
B00K275XY4|4|I only used it once so far. Everything seems to be okay. The trailer seems to clang back and fourth a little excessively.
B000EALHHG|3|For all the hype, I expected better performance.  Works as well as what I was already using (soap and water) but does not appear to be any better.
B002N5DE2G|5|good to have as back up
B006H33ZEC|5|Very simple to install  Next day delivery arrived by noon and were on my JK that afternoon.  Look and work great!
B00OAA70EA|5|So easy to install.
B000JFJLP6|5|Finally, after owning several different jump starters that didn't perform, I found one that does what it's supposed to do....start a dead battery, and when it's needed! I highly recommend this unit. Used it right out of the box the day after it arrived to jump a truck at work....it was fully charged from the factory, and started the truck, a forklift, and another car all in the same day and it performed flawlessly!
B001DRJNBG|5|Put this filter in a Subaru Outback.  Took 10 minutes.  This filter is an exact match to factory filter and easy to replace.
B000ABB1P2|5|This products works as advertised.  We use it regularly to remove light scratches on plastic products.  We would recommend to others.
B00EN9DOP2|5|Installed carb and the motor fired right up.  Great fit.
B00150T13G|5|I really love the smell of this air freshener. I've had it for about 3 weeks so far and it's still going. The little case is nice and it comes with 2 little adhesive squares to stick it under your dash or wherever you want. I just wish it were a little cheaper or at least available locally.
B008IYHD1Y|5|Great
B005ETK74Q|4|I had pro-mechanic installed this item and working just fine. Price was reasonable.  Other mechanic quoted $1200 installed but, $400 was my final cost as installed.
B005EODOTQ|5|Initially, I thought that this product was way over priced, but I took a chance and bought it anyhow. I'm glad I did, because now that I've used it, I find that its well worth the price. I guess that saying still holds true \\"if you want good stuff, you will just have to spend the bucks\\". This in my drill motor is saving not only a lot of my time, it saving a lot of ware and tare on my back and knees, plus my wheels have never looked better. Highly recommend.<br />(Note: thanks again Tony)
B003XPFM6G|5|Great piece, fits perfect, and works awesome
B000E7H4HQ|5|Awesome  product and speedy service.
B001Q6GSWG|5|great item looks great. solidly built better than any skunk 2 standard manifold ive seen
B000H0RCLI|5|I bought these 2 years ago and can say easily after this long that hella puts out great lights.  they are super bright & well built.  Strongly recommend!!
B00B938WKW|4|They fit a bit tight around the handlebars and depending on your bike they can make your bars get really close to your tank or windscreen when you turn far left or right, but usually a handlebar adjustment will solve the problem, not super stylish but I think it's well worth it for how much it helped with comfort, I recommend these over regular risers because they bring the bars closer to you, a necessary addition for my FZ6.
B0091X3M48|5|great skin cover
B0030GF2NQ|5|Perfect for what junior drivers.  Looks small when you get it, but can be seen very well on the car.  It works great and really stops people from tailgating my daughter as she learns to drive!
B0016HNVAM|5|This fixed our faulty rear hatch on our 2008 Saturn Outlook.  Did take a bit (30 min) to install but just took off the inside door panel at bottom near latch mechanism and u can see the green plug from the old switch. Swap out the old and pop in the new. Instant fix.
B000WJ3LMS|5|Great tool at a great price! Purchased for aviation A&P course.
B002GTKAHQ|4|Can see behind you better than you would think
B0009Y2CFS|4|Bought this for my uncle who takes his dog with him everywhere.  My uncle, an avid hunter, keeps the blanket in the truck for his dog on cold morning and evening hunts.  His second I have bought.
B004VR07OC|5|More than I was expected, was easy to install and it is very nice, I am very pleased with the product and the service.
B000EON01I|5|The cover arrived via FedEx faster than I expected. The instructions could use some tweaking, the pictures of a couple of the steps are not clear enough to determine which direction the foam strip should face. Here's a hint...go to You Tube and search for Access Lorado and you will find some incredible videos by actual installers that were a great help. Even with this in mind, installation was fairly quick and the cover looks incredible on my truck.
B00C66ALNW|5|As expected
B0051D3MP6|4|it's work fine
B000BYELNC|5|I purchased these for my wife's and my car - we are both impressed by these wipers.  They have worked though one PA winter with a lot of snow and ice and are still going strong this summer.  Granted, you'll pay a few bucks more than you would for a lower grade wiper blade, but these clear you windshield and rear window noticeably better.  I found this performance advantage worth the extra money, and I'll certainly buy those again in fall.  I have tried a number of brands and types, and I find these to be the best I have seen.
B004GCBFX4|5|This bumper skin has been on the car a year. It took paint well and has survived a minor &#34;nudge&#34; rear end collision. It is impossible to tell this isn't the OEM skin.
B00M1YUV9I|5|I bought this for my daughter as a gift and she loves it. Great quality and simple to apply.
B009CNYJG2|4|So far so good, very accurate, back light and many functions including DC Amps.<br />The clamp is heavy duty, with a strong spring.  You can clamp on to a wire<br />and let it hang while testing the voltage.
B000FG9XQG|5|I bought four of these last year to put on my fifth wheel trailer and I bought four more to add and to have some for back up incase one ever fails  Love them and they are very bright.
B0015YC0PI|5|Fit well, made out of strong material, good buy.
B006LSJU3S|1|The package came within reasonable time, but there were no sunglasses in the box! A pretty mindless mistake if you ask me.
B008FYKU8A|5|Great, great, great
B007FHZLPA|5|The Helmet looks great and very comfortable to wear with great features. The helmet looks better with a smoke shield. you can buy an SS shield for $30 + or i was able to fit a BILT shield from Cycle Grear for $15 . My advise is to try the product at a local store first to make sure of the fit and don't rely on the size charts.
B0006JJ588|5|This makes winterizing the travel trailer faster and uses so much less antifreeze.<br />I should have purchased this a long time ago.
B00KY6OLR8|5|Fit perfectly and easy to install.
B0070YDBGE|4|Only dislike I have with this is it won't flip up as far as I'd like . Otherwise it's great .
B00BQE5JAK|1|Terrible, put them to my amp and went out in 3 seconds
B005Y5TW0K|5|Not the highest quality helmet but nicer then I expected for the price. I would trust it. My girlfriend loves it and it fits as expected compared to other helmets. Looks very nice, graphics are well done.
B000NWPHHQ|5|I service my own vehicles, and the 2007 Dodge Nitro that this is used on has very limited accessibility to the oil filter (the frame and a crossmember restrict available space). The friction surface on the filter makes hand  installation (and removal after 5,000 miles of use) relatively easy, and should the filter be overtorqued at installation, a filter wrench can also be applied to facilitate removal.
B0087M9EMI|5|This is good and solid.
B0091SXKUY|4|Things got better.<br />However, I have a lot less hat.
B000KW1OR6|1|Based on reviews of product I thought this would be a great find. I was REALLY disappointed. Product seemed cheaply made. Tried to recharge two different ENEL3e batteries and neither would take a charge after leaving them plugged in for over 3 hours. I've been using Nikon batteries and charger for over 6years and never had any difficulty with Nikon battery chargers.     I was also disappointed in supplier - SF Planet. I requested 1 day shipping and product was sent in soft Priority Mail envelope (rather than a box) which resulted in external product packaging being deformed. Supplier finally sent me return authorization but not after first suggesting an exchange and then asking me to describe what did't work?? After having paid for expedited shipping I chose not to pay to return product--it goes in trash.     Based on the other reviews of this product, perhaps I just got a lemon but based on my personal experience I would not recommend this product or make any future purchases from SF Planet.
B002DTMVF8|5|Great price on this product. It is the best product on the market for my 2 cycle 1999 boat motor.
B004QPCLC0|5|great exact fit for my 2004 Toyota Camry
B000C7YKGG|5|Nothing much to say besides I put these in my daughter's car six months ago and all is well.  Seems to have been a good value.
B000JZFUNI|5|Great replacement for my 2001 Honda Civic EX Coupe. Much cheaper than most places! Be sure to use OEM Honda power steering fluid, as other fluids may damage the unit in the future!
B006NYI8ZG|1|Used this mount on my Corolla. Junk! Buy OEM. Same goes for Anchor I reviewed elsewhere here. Junk!
B000VHS7PW|5|One of the first things I do after buying a new vehicle is to replace with a K&N filter.  I can not state a hard-fact % gain in mpg or HP -just that Its noticeable.  I am getting nearly 33 mpg hwy (projected 31) in a Ford Edge w/ Ecoboost and my Lexus Hybrid has crept up to 36mpg hwy (projected 34).  They are pretty simple to clean so I also recommend buying the recharging kit (though it does not need to be done often).
B001EOV3JS|5|Great Product and super easy to install
B006QH6XQG|3|Battery is just as described. Starts BBC in race car fine. We'll see how long it lasts in a race car.
B001JT7B3A|5|I have mounted this on the back frame rail of my FJ40 landcruiser to plug in camping accessories.  Has been watertight and no issues.  Have pulled about 8 amps through it with no problems.  I used butt splices covered with heat shrink to make a watertight connection and used 10 gauge wiring directly to the battery and a 15 amp fuse on the positive side.
B00BE5IKUM|4|works well
B00AMMC7R0|4|Great
