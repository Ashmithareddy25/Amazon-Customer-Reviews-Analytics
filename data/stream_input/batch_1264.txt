B004LWZW4W|5.0|this movie was a surprise hit of the year. great film overall. this does not follow the previous remake with Mark Wahlberg. this is a prequel that is very well written giving details such as how the apes began to speak and how Caesar rose to become their leader and how they came together as a species that sets off a revolution. really exciting for family of all ages. there is some minor disturbing scenes of animal abuse that parents would need to explain to their kids just so you are aware but it's nothing graphic. more of just telling them how wrong it is. i recommend this movie to anyone who grew up watching the series and movies as a kid and everyone who is new to this franchise. 5 stars all across the board.
B005N95JA4|2.0|Is \\"No Spare Parts\\" really from the Some Girls era? It sounds more like the boys are cashing in on that hip-hop rhythm that's been going around for the last few years. And if you don't don't know what I'm talking about you haven't been listening to the current country and/or pop or you're just too caught up in the sheep-dip to realize it, as it's the same rhythm \\"everybody\\" is singing along to these days.  Other than that these songs sound more like the non album b-sides from the Voodoo lounge era. In fact \\"So Young\\" was issued on the \\"Out of Tears\\" single along with another non- album track called, \\"I'm Gonna Drive\\".......not that there's anything wrong with that!
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|to me this movie seemed like the modern version of The Goonies. i don't mean it's a remake of that movie or anything to do with The Goonies film. the characters just reminded me of when i first saw the Goonies. great film, great story, great characters (all fresh fish). overall a great film for the entire family and alien lovers. im not going to give you a breakdown of the movie you can find that elsewhere here on Amazon or anywhere else. im simply saying this is a great movie you should definitely buy.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Ordered this like yesterday and got it today.  Item is exactly as promised.  Good to know that this kind of service exists.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|the previews to this movie got everyone excited to see this. i went to the theater believing i was going to see a big battle between Cowboys and Aliens. sadly the battle is not so big and the movie tends to focus<br /><br /> ***SPOILER ALERT***  more on the mystery of who the girl (Olivia Wilde) is and where she comes from.<br /><br />***END OF SPOILER***<br />the big highlights from the previews are actually not so big and pretty much what you see in the previews. nothing new. Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig do a great job but is not enough to keep you interested. if you think you're going to see an \\"Independence Day\\" ala Will Smith style you will be very very disappointed. that is what i thought and would have loved this movie to be but it's not. i give this movie 3 stars because its not complete trash and the actors did a great job and there is so much potential to the movie but it's worth a rent not a buy.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This is the best Harry Potter Movie of the series and explains everything and when you go back to watch the others now everything makes sense!!
B002SSUQFG|2.0|I was very excited to get this watch from Amazon because it appeared to be a great watch, except that the band was very thin(narrow width), almost to the point where it could be confused for a womens size band.  I do not have large wrists either, and this watch looked very small on me.  The band is narrower then the diameter of a quarter, so be aware of this before you purchase.  No fault in the watch other then this.  Have returned the watch.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones are an amazing value. They sound great, don't leak too much, and are comfortable for almost everyone. I love them.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works great in Kindle Fire!  It works the best of any weather app out there and I highly recommend it.  One suggestion only.. fix rotation issues so it can work portrait or landscape mode.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was easy to understand, easy to get sucked into it. A well thought out plot with vivid descriptions. I felt as if I was there observing like a fly on the wall. The pulse racing tensions kept the pages turning till the very end and left me asking that's it? You ended the book there?<br /><br />If you are a fan of [[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]], Delirium is a no brainier. I am eagerly looking forward to the sequel!
B002JTHFUS|5.0|With the exception of their early work and \\"Achtung Baby\\", this was the pinnacle of their creativity in terms of a truly great band.  The music is dreamlike and phenomenal, with murky lyrics that, when caught, are really beautiful.  They were so young and fresh faced with their sensibilities still intact.  I haven't had much to say about anything else they have done for the big production arenas they have filled, and would never pay to see them now that they are &uuml;ber rich and above everything.  \\"The Joshua Tree\\" was okay, but it had such an Americana, southwestern feel to it that didn't rest well on my audio palate.  That was where they started to loose their way.<br /><br />This special edition of this collection is great!  As the description explains, there are a few nice extras included with this, and the rarely remembered \\"Making of Unforgettable Fire\\" documentary, which I had taped on VHS in '85, is nicely transferred to DVD.  There is also a nice colour version of \\"In the name of Love\\" Video as well as the sepia version.  One other video for \\"Bad\\" was also an interesting surprise.  The video for \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" could have been cleaned up a bit as it looks that someone transferred it from a VHS.  There could have been some digital enhancement to this video especially since it is the namesake of the collection, and they all look of about the same quality.  However, they are okay, and bring back many wonderful and nostalgic memories of when I saw them perform in '85.  The live aid, as well as the meadowlands, performances are also ones I had never seen before.<br /><br />I had forgotten how unforgettable this was, and I'm glad this was available.  I wouldn't pay this kind of money for anything else they've done since.
B004SRNH10|1.0|Although AIR 2.7 works on Amazon's own Kindle Fire, and a \\"captive runtime\\" AIR 3.1 app works fine, the separate AIR 3.1 runtime in the Amazon Appstore is not compatible with Amazon's own device. Seems ironic.
1451648537|4.0|It's odd to say that a 600 page biography isn't definitive. The writer had exclusive access to Jobs; his friends, family and employees were encouraged to participate. The author is selling the book on the basis that it's unvarnished and nuanced. This is supposed to be the definitive guide to the personality behind the inventions, brands, inspirational products, tirades and impassioned speeches.   It's a brilliant book in many respects. It's well written as would be absolutely expected from a writer of Walter Isaacson's experience and talent. It also gives us a glimpse of the generous and caring side of a man often described as a tyrant. Letting Steve speak to the reader at the end of the final chapter is inspired and Steve's words should be studied and dissected by young entrepreneurs for years to come. Don't sweat the profits, focus on making great products!  But it's strangely flawed. Other reviewers have pointed out that there are moments of Job's life that are glossed over and, perhaps, covered better elsewhere. The \\"Second Coming of Steve Jobs\\" arguably does a better job of describing his mental state when he was heading towards bankruptcy as Pixar and NeXT gobbled up his remaining resources. If you were to judge Jobs solely based on this book, the only stressful point in his life was his resignation from Apple and success was inevitable in one form or another. Working at both Apple and Pixar concurrently was tough but that's written off in about a paragraph. It's just a footnote to greater success. Is this really the case? There's little sense of the road less traveled and the soul searching he must have done. What motivated his decisions, what was his thought process like? Despite the many quotes from the author's long discussions with Steve, these mostly have the polished veneer of an Apple keynote. Isaacson was taking minutes at Steve's ultimate product launch, himself.   Perhaps we are all simply too familiar with this flawed genius and it's asking the impossible for a writer to discover something new, but that's how this book is billed. The fundamental problems in this book are   1) it lacks reflection as the author was under huge pressure to publish. Isaacson should have waited until Steve was dead, the dust had settled and gotten more objective and reflective contributions from the many interviewees in this book. Very often, we don't understand a person's character and contribution to our lives until they're gone and our minds adjust to never seeing or working with them again.      2) The author fell prey to the reality distortion field. Spinning his life as a series of stories is Steve's intellectual backyard. He owns it and it plays to his brilliant showmanship and the ability to entrance that has been the hallmark of his career.      3) Steve was dying and Isaacon simply didn't push him hard enough to get to the juice of his personality flaws. Many contradictions in his lifestyle and beliefs are laid out but we never get the psychiatrists chair treatment that his fans would like. Iaaacson couldn't arguably as, by the time he started the book, Steve was frequently ill and his longevity was uncertain. Isaacson simply couldn't risk p!ssing him off, nor did he want to hurt him. This is understandable and it's just unfortunate he didn't start the book years earlier.    4) Isaacson may not have studied the unofficial biographies or dismissed them as he wanted a fresh perspective. Fresh can be a synonym for naieve. Therefore we see a rediscovery of old narratives without the benefit of critical analysis. The author's biography of Einstein is, by contrast, revelatory and confrontational in its depiction of the 20th century's most brilliant mind.   This biography is essential reading (no mistake about it) but this is ultimately hagiography of a 20th and 21st Century iCon. What made him tick? Who knows but I suspect that if Isaacson was to rewrite the book next year he'd provide us with better insights. He has been analysed better in fiction (see his sister's \\"A Regular Guy\\") What a pity.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|I was at the show in Cleveland the night they filmed this DVD.  It was a great show, but like all concerts, where you sit has a direct effect on how you hear the music.  I didn't have the best seats in the house so the sound mix, while I am sure it sounded great in the headset of the front of the house mixer, was not the best from my vantage point.  Watching the DVD and remembering the show as I saw it live allowed me to hear everything I missed at the live performance.  That being said, for Rush fans this is a must see.  They played Moving Pictures in its entirety, included 2 songs from their upcoming album (BU2B and Caravan), plus revived some previously retired performances (Closer to the Heart) and some that I believe may never have been played live before this tour (Presto).  In true Rush style and with an incredible sense of humor, they included some skits with that are sure to tickle your funny bone.   One of the things I like best about the live show was seeing fans as young as 8-9 years old attending the show with their parents.  But not just that they were there, they were really into the music.  It is nice to see older Rush fans introducing their children to this incredible rock band.  Strongly recommend this to all Rush fans.  Sit and enjoy it with your kids and let them experience the awesome music of Rush.

B00009XITP|5.0|What a Girl Wants is a delightful love story for the true/hopeless romantic. I really enjoyed this film about love lost and rebuilding broken relationships.  I still don't know how I missed this one in the theatre!  The acting is really superb, especially by Colin Firth who is outstanding, and he and Kelly Preston have such excellent chemistry.  The story has such a good balance of humour and touching moments, and it is very enjoyable with a good message. It also ties up all the loose ends nicely and leaves you with a happy feeling. It sort of reminds me of the Parent Trap a bit as well as Cinderella or the Princess Diaries. The scenes from Britain and Morocco are very nice and add to the cultural flavour of the film.  I also like how songs with such fitting lyrics are used to add to the emotion in the storyline.<br /><br />In terms of the acting, it is amazing how much Colin Firth can say with his eyes!! It is interesting because in this film we see so many different moods for Henry Dashwood, and unlike his role as Mr. Darcy, Colin Firth smiles quite a bit. He has such a nice smile and actually looks more like his fellow actor and brother Jonathan than I had previously thought (excellent actor too esp. in Victoria & Albert). During this film, because we see so many different sides of the character, I came away feeling that I knew Colin Firth a little better, even though it is about a fictional person.  Kelly Preston is really good as Libby and shows such touching emotion in her role as the woman who only ever loved one man. Amanda Bynes also does an excellent job and she is a great comedic actress.  There are some famous British stars in this film including Anna Chancellor, Eileen Atkins and Jonathan Pryce who also add class and talent to their supporting roles.<br /><br />Libby Reynolds is a singer who decides to go to see the world and meets Henry, her Knight in Shining Armour, in Morocco. \\"They fall hopelessly and passionately in love\\" and are married in a Moroccan wedding ceremony. They plan to make it official when they return to London, but his family and advisors get in the way. Henry is a man of Title and with the sudden death of his father, he is Lord Dashwood.  His advisor (Jonathan Pryce) tricks Libby into thinking that Henry wants her to leave, and convinces Henry that Libby leaves because she has another man.  Unknown to Henry, Libby is pregnant with their daughter Daphne. For 17 years Libby and Daphne live in China Town in New York.  Daphne works as a waitress at wedding receptions where her mother's band performs, and she feels sad when she watches the father-daughter dances (I cried during that part) and wishes for that kind of relationship with HER father. Every birthday Daphne always makes a wish that her father will come to find her, but her mother doesn't tell Henry because she is afraid her daughter will get hurt in the same way she did. Daphne always feels that part of her is missing because she doesn't know her father, and so when she is finished high school she goes to London to find him and also finds romance (Oliver James) along the way. Her father is engaged to the daughter of the advisor who got rid of Libby and is starting a political career. Eventually, Henry discovers what his true priorities are, and what he is willing to sacrifice to do the right thing and find true happiness.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this film. There are a few mildly offensive words used, but everything else is as clean as a whistle.  The worst for me was the bejesus comment.  However, if you love romantic films, especially with a British flavour, you will love this movie.  It presents hope and that our dreams can be even better than we imagine..

B001EAWME2|3.0|To be clear, the audio is ok, but the actual image quality is like a dirty, grainy DVD, there's nothing blu ray about this one. However, great movie although it never really makes an effort to explain its own backstory which leaves you feeling stupid at the end of the movie for not understanding who the hell Billy and Agnes are. I bought it because I heard it predated Halloween as one of the first slashers, which is something you don't brag about on the back cover of your movie unless said movie has enough actual substance to join the ranks of a classic like Halloween. In the end, I prefer Halloween, but I regret not seeing this movie sooner as it belongs in any horror fan's collection. It definitely does suspense a little better than Halloween... creepy phone calls galore and you never see the killer's face nor find out his motive for slaughtering a bunch of girls. I recommend it, just don't expect the transfer to look like \\"The Departed\\" or anything.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I got a pair of these some ~10 years ago with a WalkMan (portable cassette player). They have been my favorite pair ever, and only now did they just go out.  They have better sound quality than all the other ear-buds I've had, and have lasted a long time.  I was ecstatic to find the same product number selling here on Amazon, and just ordered another pair.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SUCH A QUICK SHIP!! I would definitely do business with you again!
B001EN71CW|1.0|Obviously the series as such is fine.  All the indoor/outdoor scenes are in full HD, the space scenes were upscaled and it shows, but that's not a deal breaker considering the additional content of the blu-ray set.<br /><br />The problem is that the disks themselves were extremely poorly authored.  For example, clicking the \\"disc menu\\" button on the remote control does not actually return one to the disc menu, it simply doesn't work at all.  This isn't specific to a DVD player either, it happened on two different models tested (Samsung, PS3).  The disc menu navigation doesn't work right which results in one being dropped out of the disc menu altogether.<br /><br />Perhaps more importantly whoever mastered this DVD thought it would be a good idea to add anti-piracy notices to the end of EACH episode, in multiple languages nonetheless.  Here's a hint, a few seconds of anti-piracy text doesn't stop pirates, that really shouldn't be news.  Still, instead of making the anti-piracy stuff into one chapter they created 8 CHAPTERS out of it so that one has to hit the remote 8 times in order to advance to the next episode.  This totally breaks immersion.<br /><br />We own approximately 900 DVDs and Blu-Rays and not ONCE have we experienced such a poorly authored disk.  It's 2011, this shouldn't have happened in the first place and there's no way it should have made it through quality control/quality assurance.  Total fail.<br /><br />I bought this when it was on sale for $18 for the set and for that it's acceptable.  I would never pay anything close to full price for this set and advise that you don't either.<br /><br />The thing to do with this disk is to rip it and put it back together without all the authoring flaws, alas now that I have read the anti-piracy notice I am aware that I am not allowed to do that.

We were excited to find out that we were selected to start a contest on our blog to give out \\"Start Something that Matters\\", a book by the founder of Toms Shoes Blake Mycoskie.    I have always been inspired by how Toms has created success through giving, but after reading this book I have come to truly admire the social good they have created. I have yet to meet Blake but you, like I, will get the feeling through the book that when he tells you about why he does what he does I am almost certain his eyes gloss and his voice is filled with conviction.

0385535139|3.0|...for the paperback.  I've always bought John Grisham's books as soon as they are released and have read them as soon as I can in hardback, and I've loved almost all of them.  This one was different. It took me so long to read this one, whereas with his others I've finished them in no longer than two to three days, usually two.    The good things about this book are its humor and the character of David Zinc.  Not just that he is a character in the book, but his show of integrity and intelligence, and his willingness to walk away from a huge law firm with hundreds of lawyers who spend 80 hours a week billing by the hour.  About halfway through the book, it picks up a little speed, but it never gets to the usual page-turning tension and suspense that Grisham's other books have done.  Finley and Figg are laughable, as they are intended to be, with their \\"boutique law firm\\" that is almost, but not quite, a real law firm.  Finley and Figg are literal ambulance chasers and are lucky to be making five-figure incomes.  They never see the inside of a courtroom and hope they never do.  Once Figg finds out about the drug Krayoxx, a cholesterol reducer that has been linked to heart attacks, he goes on a mission to find people affected by the drug and hopes to join a class action suit against the pharmaceutical company that makes it.  From there on out I thought the book got lost in and bogged down with lawyers, patients, and back and forth phone calls among all of them.  Then the defense team steps in and they have to be kept track of, as well.  The writing just wasn't as clear as in previous books.    I certainly won't say that I won't read the next Grisham novel, because I will.  I've always loved John Grisham's books and look forward to each one.  This one just wasn't my cup of tea or my dose of Krayoxx.

B001DF68MA|4.0|Would have given 5 stars but I thought the foot rest design was weak - should either extend further or be removable.   Pros: easy to install/remove (at least the seat part), allows biker to balance weight extremely easy, comfortable for the child, nice to have the kid right in front of you.  Cons: foot rest not removable/doesn't extend too far (rated for children up to 40 lbs, but they will outgrow it long before then), rider must adjust the way you pedal to accommodate, not suitable for rides longer than a few miles.  Net: great product for the price, exactly what we needed.
B000J10EQU|3.0|Way back in 1978, Warner Brothers took a chance on the unknown Chris Reeves and an intelligent screenplay and found themselves with a hit. Unfortunately courage left the Warner Bros lot in this one and the result is a hodgepodge mismatch of a film with parts that is great filmmaking and others that will have you scratching your head in disbelief. Watch the film carefully, especially the scenes that were cut (available on the DVD version) and you will see what could have been an outstanding reboot of Superman in film. It looks like Warner Bros did not trust the abilities of Brandon Routh and limited his screen presence in favor of screen time to the more experienced Kevin Spacey. Big mistake. Spacey's Luthor overwhelms the story which is tailored to the character of Luthor instead of where it belongs, with Superman.  The screenplay also was obviously altered to fit into mass audience appeal. The more interesting storyline, 'What is Clark's purpose in life after failing to find Krypton' is obliterated in the final cut. This film is a failure of the studio, not the cast nor the director. Hopefully, the next reboot will get it right.
B005ORVN1Y|5.0|The Sector Box sets are the latest and supposedly greatest reissue for what must be one of Mercury Records' most profitable back catalogs - that of Rush, the Canadian trio many of us consider to be one of rock's greatest bands ever.  Featuring the last Terry Brown produced album (Signals) in a 5.1 channel mix, Sector 3 provides us with several of the band's greatest achievements, notably Signals itself and 1984's dark and spare Grace Under Pressure.  This box also features the fresh, appealing, melodically inventive, though occasionally gimmicky Power Windows and Hold Your Fire, which represents the zenith of the band's increasing use of keyboard and synthesizers to provide color and effect.    Most hard-core Rush fans find a considerable amount to disagree over when it comes to 80's Rush - many believe it to be too gimmicky, too keyboard intensive, they lament that Alex was essentially pieced out of many songs and, in some cases, whole albums (though that is really a stretch, especially when applied to Signals), and that the band fell victim to a penchant for keyboard technology and the fashion of the times (this was the 80's, after all...)  I grew up during this time (junior high-senior high) and bought all of these albums on vinyl upon their release, so I can't really hate them.  After 25 years, though, I can start to be more objective about them.  Some are great, even more so than when they were released - such as Signals and GUP.  Power Windows remains a strong album lyrically, but some of its effects and \\"moments\\" are growing less appealing with the passage of time.  Hold Your Fire, which I used to refer to as \\"Power Windows II\\" or \\"Son of Power Windows\\", is another very dualistic album for me, with great tracks such as Second Nature, Prime Mover, Lock and Key, and High Water being offset by Tai Shan, Time Stand Still (yes, I said it), and Turn the Page.  Finally, we have the last live Rush album of the 80's, A Show of Hands, which I now love instead of merelyliking alot.    These CD's have been completely remastered after being transferred from either the original master tapes or 192 khz copies apparently made 7 or so years ago for the band's archive.  There is a great internet article about this remastering process where the mastering engineer Andy VanDette talks about his love for Rush, the honor and privilege it was to remaster all of their albums, and the process of doing so.  For example, he notes that he tried for 3 days to use the Grace Under Pressure master tape for this set, but just could not get it to sound better than the 192 khz copy; the original tape had just deteriorated too much since 1984.  He does not mention every album specifically.  What is clear, however, is that VanDette has boosted the bass considerably on these remasters, something he alludes to in the article.  Looking at the wave forms of the songs, it's likely that some compression has been used in some places, along with the bass equalization.  Overally, there is a heavier feel to the music generally.  On Signals and the studio albums I thought this was to the good for most songs, especially for those listeners without speakers like we had in the 80's (i.e. we had very large ones).  On A Show of Hands, the new transfer is clearly better than any previous issue - this album finally sounds and feels like a live album!  It has weight, presence, and sounds much more like the Rush I remember from concerts during that time.  So is this box worth the price?  If you love Rush and you like 5.1, you might consider this a mandatory purchase.  However, many folks out in Rush land suspect that all Rush albums will be remixed in 5.1 with the different vocal takes and the other small changes you hear here.  If you only listen to CD's and or rip CD's for iPod, these are the best sounding remasters for those purposes.  It is unlikely that there will be another remastering done to the Rush catalog again, so this will likely be the final statement.  I thinkit has been well-done, and in good presentation.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game! Its a classic. Easy to use, doesn't freeze up my phone and you can exit and pick up you left off. Much better than than the other one I tried first.
B002BWP49M|5.0|The movie was much better than I expected - while I agree the wolf voice overs left a lot to be desired the scenes of Bella wasting away were very good.  I was hooked within the first 5 minutes - there was just something in this movie that the others lacked. As I had to work the evening of the release I talked my 67 yr old  aunt into coming to see the movie with me for the first show Friday morning.  After seeing the movie she was hooked, read the books, and then watched all the movies in one day. Now she threatens me with haunting if she passes before the next movie and she does not get to see it which is hilarious as she is healthier than I am.  Just goes to show love stories appeal to all ages and we have a date for next November to see the last movie together - neither one of us  can wait :o)
B000UJ48SQ|1.0|First off; I have not purchased THIS PARTICULAR version of this all-time great film, however, I do want to purchase it for a friend who has bluray.  The problem with this particular release is that the bluray version seems to be a terrible transfer.  My real issue here aside from the fact that Warner Brothers continues to foist garbage transfers on an unsuspecting public is that ONCE AGAIN, Amazon.com refuses to separate it's product reviews, so it is simply IMPOSSIBLE for me to ascertain the quality of the DVD RELEASE vs. the BLURAY RELEASE.<br /><br />AMAZON.COM, if you are going to continue to provide customer reviews, PLEASE STOP mixing reviews for separate products together;  The QUALITY OF INDIVIDUAL RELEASES IS DIFFERENT AND AFFECTS THE CUSTOMER'S DECISION TO BUY!

0393061310|4.0|I thought this book was pretty good. It gave me some insightful views on fields of study I never even knew existed. Basically the book is about a short history of the world in thirteen thousand years. Jared Diamond talks about everything that helps a society evolve to become more advanced, such as plant and animal domestication, military, population size, and literacy. Diamond hits the nail on the head in his porpouse to inform the every day reader in on what really is going on around the globe into the earliest times.     I would recomend this book to the knowledge seeking reader who is interested in anything about the world from all kinds of different time periods. The book can be a little confusing considering how it jumps from topic to topic so abruptly, but for the most part its easy to keep up with, even if you have no background knowledge to support your reading. Overall, i liked the book, lots of facts, new information i never knew before, and helpful knowledge, Diamond did a good job with this book.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|Hi everyone, For people with both an XBOX 360 and PS3 but wish to replace the PS3 controller should try this one. This controller is the size of the XBOX one but it has the LT and RT triggers slightly curverd upwards unlike the PS3'S which is curved down and makes your fingers slip. The middle home button light up as well as the button right of the start button. It's wireless with the wireless adapter included. But know this you must turn on the PS3 manually from the front. If you scroll to turn off no problem. It also has rumble. So if you love your XBOX controller and wish to replace your PS3 controller buy this one. Overall it works great feels good. Right now my PS3 controller is on early retirement.

159514188X|5.0|This book changed the way I look at many things. Taught me that sometimes we do things just because we may think they are funny but you never know how they affect that person. Maybe for you it's no big deal but for that person it could be another rock slowly sinking them.<br />Reading this I have been made aware that the littlest think could be that last shove for someone on the brink. I admit that I am a person who criticizes and gossips and I make fun of other people, never giving thought how I am hurting another person. I have made a promise to myself that I will try to minimize these things and not be so critical. A lot of us do this and don't even notice.<br /><br />Clay was a character that we should all aspire to be like. He's kind, caring, honest, smart and just a great person. I'm not saying he's perfect but I admired the way he tried to be the best he could be all the time.<br />Hannah was a different matter. She was a very troubled girl being eaten away by her insecurities. She sought acceptance and comfort but no one gave it to her and in her mind the best way to stop hurting was to simply commit suicide. I loved the way Asher used the tapes to show how Hannah felt but you also knew Clay's side of the story which was also very crucial.<br />Suicide should not be an option but sadly many people recur to it daily as a solution. I want to take this opportunity to say that if you have ever thought about ending your life, or if you know of someone to please take action. There is help. There are other ways. I am no expert in such matters so if you'd like to know more information visit [...]<br /><br />All Content © Crazed Bookie

B005FLX2WC|5.0|The combination of Beths voice and joes guitar is epic.  There are some slow blues numers that really simmer and a couple of high energy tunes for fun.  Beths voice is a chameleon.  Sometimes reminds me of Nora Joses.
0857685627|3.0|I must say that I'm not a Halo gamer. I just bought this book because I've been hearing so much about the whole Halo mythology and its immense popularity in the gaming industry. Being an avid fan of conceptual designs, I grabbed this book thinking that as the title suggests, it is really about a comprehensive look at the art and concepts of the whole Halo series. Turns out it's just a mixed bag of various small scoops on the elements of the Halo series. The artworks featured, while good looking, are never as great as I thought they would be. I should have just got purchased the Halo Encyclopedia instead.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I'd actually give this 4.5 stars. It was a darn good book. The only reason I didn't give it a full five was that I felt it was just a smidge too \\"cute\\" with the insider jokes. As a child who grew up during the late '70s/'80s, it's clear that I am the perfect target age for this novel. Younger or older readers might find the references confusing and anachronistic.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable tale of a video game world. One of my friends complained that there wasn't enough happening in the \\"real world,\\" and I understand that complaint. The great majority of the tale takes place in the fantastic online OASIS universe. It's an admirable debut for Ernest Cline, and will look forward to checking out his next project.

B000AAF1U4|5.0|This film is beautifully animated; the characters are so unique and different. The landscapes, the animals and overall design in this film is something to admire. It teaches lessons to both kids and adults about appreciation and friendship. The unique bond is created between Pacha and the prince being forced to take a trip back to the palace is enchanting. The selfish prince who is turned into a llama by one of his subjects ends up at the hands of Pacha , a peasant living in one of the villages in the princes province. The films can stand up next to the classics like Aladdin and Hercules and your family will love it. Enjoy this classic; this is when animated movies made were to be watched for everyone!
B004EPZ03O|4.0|What was supposed to be a romantic anniversary between Gary (Jason Segel) and  his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) turns into a trip to bring the Muppets back together, when Gary brings his die-hard muppet fan brother Walter along \\"who's also a Puppet/Muppet\\".<br />  Together, they must stop Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), a greedy oil tycoon, who wants to get rid of the old Muppet theater to drill for oil. The Muppets have to re-unite and put on a telethon show to bring in enough cash to save the theater. However, due to old relationship problems between Kermit and Miss Piggy, bringing Piggy back might be harder than expected and finding a celebrity host for their show is also much harder than Kermit expected.<br />  The Muppets marks the return of the beloved puppets that  haven't been on the big screen since the 1999 film, Muppets in Space. There's plenty of entertaining songs \\"such as, Am I Man or a Muppet ?\\", celebrity appearances \\"like,  Zach Galifianakis, Emily Blunt, Neil Patrick Harris, Jim Parsons, Alan Arkin, Sarah Silverman,  Selina Gomez and Jack Black\\"  and a faithful story to keep Muppet fans and new audiences entertained.<br />  Screenwriter and star Jason Segel (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, How I Met Your Mother), due to his love for the  Muppets has given us a surprisingly charming, smart and funny Muppet film, that is one of the best in Muppet franchise. Critics would agree, since the Muppets is one of the best rated films of the year, so check it out, but be warned, a lot of the songs might get stuck in your head for days.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|First off - for anyone interested, this blu-ray is definitely region-free (Im in the UK) so dont worry about that.  This film isnt perfect. Lynch himself wasnt happy with it. But a lot of people love it! It falls off a bit towards the end and the final battle isnt really as good as it should be but its got so many good points that these outweigh the bad easily.  Classic 80s sci-fi!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have been trying out so many different applications to sync my Kindle Fire to my desktop, and none really did all I wanted them to do, and some are costly once past the trial period.  This application is a true GEM!!!!!  Very easy to set up on the Kindle and the desktop.  I went immediately to my desktop from the Kindle and it was like being on my desktop!  There will be no need to sync two or three different programs now to get all I need.  I use the Palm Desktop as I love having a calendar and contacts, memos, and tasks all in one place.  I am very spoiled with the Palm desktop and was trying to find something to match it in syncing.  With Splashtop - my whole computer is there!!  Right now, I would give it a 10 if I could!  Definitely a must have!!!!!!!
B003X2O6KW|5.0|Just when you thought he was out, Kanye comes back even stronger. This is by far one of Kanye's most catchiest albums to date. With songs like Hell Of A Life, All Of The Lights and Lost In The World, Kanye proves once again that he is a creative genius. Five Stars!!!
B0065SQ960|1.0|What on earth happened here?? These are some of the worst remixes I have ever heard. I was not thrilled with the \\"Born This Way\\" album to begin with, so I had hoped this remix album might be more my thing. Instead I was tormented by awful noise from start to finish. What is up with that Goldfrapp remix of \\"Judas\\"?? Seriously--is that some sort of joke?  I am really perplexed who put this horrific collection together. Was s/he tone deaf?? I will never listen to this again. Do not waste your money!
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is very addicting.  It has a good mix of easy and challenging levels.  Unfortunately, I'm done with all the levels.  I'm patiently waiting for an update.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|I watched this movie yesterday. I bought it on a whim. Today, I'm still recovering! I laughed, I laughed some more, then I laughed until I thought I might pass out. I'm certain that my face changed colors a few times.<br />This movie takes where horror spoofs ( Scary Movie specifically) went wrong and fixes a few things. If you took Friday the 13th, Evil Dead, Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and mixed them with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, you would get Tucker and Dale vs Evil.<br />On a final note; beer cures everything from depression, bee stings and severed body parts.<br />Now, a word of warning.<br />Be careful when eating popcorn while watching this...you may get choked.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game runs very smooth and is fun to play.  It's a great way to kill time and can be pretty addicting.  I'm glad I was able to score this game when it was free.

B000JIHP88|5.0|We got this as a mobile to entertain my son before he could roll over, and wound up keeping it until he was around 1.5 years old. He absolutely loved it, from start to finish. The mobile was calming for him, as was the music. After he was old enough to stand and get into trouble grabbing the mobile, we removed it but kept the musical base. That base was his lullaby every night for pretty much the whole time.<br /><br />The mobile slowly rotates when music is playing. The base is bulky, but attaches safely onto the rail of your crib with a (non-marring) screw-in pressure clamp. The mobile plays several different songs, but my son always wanted the same one.<br /><br />Pro:<br />+ my son loved it! as a mobile when he was very young, and as a lullaby music box when he got older<br />+ buttons are accessible from the crib. The unit was mounted high enough he didn't hit the buttons on accident, but could turn it on to self-sooth in the middle of the night, if he wanted.<br />+ mobile is cute, and removeable, which extended its usable life for us.<br /><br />Con:<br />- the mounting hardware is a bit bulky. We had to keep the crib an extra inch or two away from the wall because of how long the large pressure screw was<br />- the whole thing is a bit big and bulky. This in general doesn't matter, but when we wanted to bring it with us on trips or on the airplane it took up lots of room. Probably not a consideration for most people :)<br /><br />Overall we were very happy with this mobile. We even took the base on trips with us to help our son feel comfortable wherever we happened to be traveling to, especially at night.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|I recall seeing the video for \\"Yellow\\" back in early 2001, and turning to my wife and saying, \\"They remind me of Travis and U2.\\" Liking both bands, I went and got \\"Parachutes\\" which was not as good as I was expecting. So, I skipped \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" in 2002, until I heard \\"Clocks\\" and \\"The Scientist\\". I bought that album and felt it was an improvement, and I was becoming a Coldplay fan. I bought \\"X & Y\\" in 2005 and thought it was the band's best work until they surpassed it with 2008's \\"Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends\\". Now comes \\"Mylo Xyloto\\".<br /><br />Unlike other critics of Coldplay, I have felt that the band has always had there own sound, but they continually borrow from the U2 play book. I have never felt that the band was trying to be U2. Coldplay is like a U2 offspring--there are similarities, but ultimately, Chris Martin and company are working their own row. The comparisons to Travis and other bands has been set aside at this point in Coldplay's career. I might also add that I grew up with that late 70's/early 80's punk/new wave generation, and so Coldplay reminds me of those good vibes. They are not alone, however, because you can point to The Killers, Bloc Party, Snow Patrol, Travis, The Futureheads, Keane, Interpol, White Lies, Stellastarr*, AWOLNATION, The Airborne Toxic Event, Cold War Kids, Blue October, Cut Copy, Florence + The Machine, Friendly Fires, Kaiser Chiefs, Matt & Kim, Mumford & Sons, Dan Black and others are working the same musical angle.<br /><br />This is to be celebrated. I felt the 1990's grunge movement was mostly dreadful. Whining, moaning, complaining--that was the alternative movement of the 1990's with a few exceptions. I see someone has felt the need to point out Pearl Jam having more integrity than Coldplay. Peal Jam is so musically separate from Coldplay, I don't even see the need for comparison. Within the genre, Coldplay do a fine job at what they do. I would never compare them to grunge music, heavy metal music, country music, reggae music or rap music--that's not what they're doing. No, what Coldplay are doing is making uplifting, melodic, alternative rock--like U2. Coldplay have yet to reinvent themselves like U2. But even, U2 came back to the music that made them popular in the first place eventually. To me, Coldplay has grown artistically as a band from album to album.<br /><br />I agree with some who say that \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" is the band's attempt to appeal to their fanbase by keeping the vibe from their previous two albums intact here. However, the band does push itself in other ways with the electronic hip-pop of \\"Princess Of China\\" with Rihanna adding just the right spine tingling vocals. If you had asked me back in 2005 would I picture Coldplay working perfectly with Rihanna I would have told you I don't see it happening. \\"Major Minus\\" is another track that has a more aggressive approach than what is expected from the band. It's more electric guitar heavy than most of what they have done in the past. The production from Brian Eno is also another shift in the band's overall sound. It still sounds very much like Coldplay, but the production appears more layered here, more produced. I like production values. I can't tell you the number of bland and boring acoustic sets I've heard from numerous artists throughout the past decade. I like the fact that Coldplay are experimenting with production values with Brian Eno. I like what Eno does, so I'm biased in that respect.<br /><br />There are a few tracks, ballads, that are certainly reminiscent of \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Fix You\\" such as \\"Us Against The World\\" and \\"U.F.O.\\" There are also a handful of rocking uplifting \\"Beautiful Day\\" type tracks here like \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\", \\"Charlie Brown\\", \\"Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall\\" and \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart\\".<br /><br />\\"Paradise\\" is also a bit of a departure for the band with its mid-tempo beat and swirling electronic bass textures and acoustic piano breaks.<br /><br />There are three short musical interlude segues that I felt (and I see others felt too) were unnecessary. Why didn't the band and Eno just make \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" part of \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\"? The same for \\"M.M.I.X.\\" with \\"Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall\\" and \\"A Hopeful Transmission\\" with \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart\\". I admit I am not a fan of musical interludes/spoken interludes/segue ways. They distract from the overall listening experience for me. I really wish someone had told Eno and the band to please just make them part of the main tracks, do not break them up into separate songs.<br /><br />All this being said about \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" it easily makes my best of list for 2011. It has exactly what I am looking for: Strong, memorable melodies, uplifting choruses and verses, strong production values, and lyrics that are relatively accessible and appealing. It's the type of album I actually look forward to listening to repeatedly when so many albums I listen to just fall flat for one reason or another.<br /><br />Here is how \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" compares with the band's previous works:<br /><br />2000 Parachutes: Three Stars<br />2002 A Rush Of Blood To The Head: Three and a Half Stars<br />2005 X & Y: Four Stars<br />2008 Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends: Four and a Half Stars<br />2011 Mylo Xyloto: Four Starsues that I felt (and I see others felt too) were unnecessary.

B001DHXT1G|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to not be $20 or more. Thanks to cyber week deals I got a movie I have only been able to watch on TV or rent because I refused to pay so much for a movie that have been out for such a long time already.
B000002U82|1.0|I really tried to like this album. seen it on all the top album lists + how it was in the charts for a million years. i cant stand it. even tried listening to it every day for a couple of weeks to see if it needed to grow on me. well it did not. whats with all the sound effects????? clocks, running,cash registers, ect. oh, and that chick screaming for what seems to be hours. grew up + still love, beatles, stones , led, zep, hendrix ect but sorry to say , dont dig this album at all!
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Great movie, the actors done such a great job. Ryan Gosling mmm...need i say more. lol But everyone was great Steve Carroll is always funny. Lots of twists but a must see.
B005ZV8Q2S|1.0|There is no other way to say it, this is just a bad movie. I expected it to have some level of crude humor, but from the first word everything was about the F word. My wife and I normally like Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman movies, but this was just a bad movie. If you want a movie with a predictable plot, and extremely foul and crude language, you may like this. Save your $ and watch something else.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I don't always get to watch the news at night before bed; nor do I turn on the TV in the mornings while getting ready for work. The weather in the south can be so wishy-washy, which makes knowing how to dress difficult. It's great to be able to check out the day's weather in a flash on my Fire!
098357670X|5.0|If you want a comprehensive book about caricature, this is the one!  Tom Richmond really illustrates how forms can be pushed and pulled to create a balanced, yet exaggerated likeness of the human subject.  Yet, he takes it further, by explaining the importance of making a caricature more than just showing physical likeness.  He guides you toward making a statement about the personality of the subject.  This book is just what the world has been waiting for in caricature training.  It's so full of information on every aspect of this art form, presented in his intelligent, witty style of writing.  And Tom has filled every page with color examples of his own work for inspiration.  When I first received this book, the first thing I did was flip through and look at all the hilarious artwork!  I couldn't put it down, and I hadn't even started reading it yet!  The whole book is total eye-candy.  It's the best book out there on the art of caricature.  I don't see how future book could ever top this one.
B003VNKNDC|1.0|I added this Transcend 4GB USB drive to make my $25.00 minimum for free shipping. It was defective. It will connect, and disconnect 2 or 3 times every time I plug it into the USB port.  I updated the USB drivers, and tried re-formatting, and still the same problem. None of my other various brand USB drives (including a TransCend USB 3 32GB drive) do, or ever did that. I don't fault the company. I think this is just one of the few defective drives somehow got sold by TransCend. I mean NOT to discourage anyone from buying this or any TranCend drive. I took a replacement from AMAZON because I stil think the drive is a good value for the money.<br /><br />Although Amazon makes the return almost painless whereby one prints out a free shipping return label to just affix to the return package, I think the estimated date range to expect my replacement from AMAZON is too far off. On Dec 3, 2011 the replacement and return were authorized by Amazon and they estimate my replacement will be between 01/06/12 and 01/24/12!  Although, as good as Amazon is I'll bet I receive a replacement in about 7 days. If not it is no biggie, I don't have a pressing need to use it right now.<br /><br />UPDATE:  03-19-13<br /><br />The second drive is just as quirky in Windows 7 PRO 64-BIT. Windows tools always has to run on the drive before I can use it. AND today I could not put Windows 8 PRO 64 on it using MS's Windows 7 USB DVD Download software to put a Windows 8 ISO onto a USB Drive. The drive is very frustrating to own.  I contacted Transcend on this second exact same drive and asked them to replace it with a drive that they tested and is NOT quirky and that I can put Windows 8 on.  :-[

B0002VYOWW|5.0|I haven't seen the blu-ray release of this film (and I primarily purchase blu-ray relases), but I found that the pre-blu-ray Superbit releases were pretty darn spectacular both visually and audio - Cliffhanger is no exception. The DTS soundtrack is crystal clear and rocks the room. The transfer shows very little grain and the colors seem natural and well balanced. There isn't a lot of evidence of DNR scrubbing though I'm sure there was some. A side note: I wish studios would start applying DNR a little more judiciously. They recorded movies on 35/65/70mm film and a little 'noise' adds both texture and depth to each frame (IMHO), but I digress. The bottom line for me: I really couldn't be enticed to trade-in my Superbit collection for new blu-ray transfers unless they offered something totally unresistable (like the new Citizen Kane, Ben Hur, etc.).
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I got this as a gift for Christmas. Its compact, durable, and sharpens quite a bit,excellent multi function sharpener, great stocking stuffer.
1856697525|5.0|This book is visually stunning. The text is informative and unpretentious and the collection of Bass' artwork, from film posters to corporate logos, is breathtaking.  The book as a whole provides fascinating insight into the creative process of one of the most influential designers of our time.
B003R0LBVW|3.0|I love a book with complex characters, the ones I don't like because I either recognize one of my own character flaws in them, or they are too pathetic.  I think the author developed the characters well and I was completely dialed into Patty, Walter, and Katz.  I liked seeing how all of their obsessions ebbed and flowed over the years and how the same passion could be their own destruction.  The author also writes well, but in this reader's opinion, he wrote too much.  Half way through the book I started skipping pages of wandering thoughts - all of which could be summed up ten pages later in three lines of dialogue. I literally 'flew' through 40% of the second half and only reengaged for the ending, and I didn't miss a thing.<br /><br />Overall, I am giving this book a three because I really liked the flawed characters and how the author wrote them in a way that made me like them despite myself, and the story, or point of the book, but the author did not give the reader enough credit for grasping the implications of Walter's passion for conservation and over-population (something I completely agree with), and therefore, wasted some of this reader's time.  But I also applaud him and am thankful to him for bringing up the issue of over-population.  It is the White Elephant in the world and most people/all leaders are afraid of touching it.  But now that I mention this, I guess that is why the author had to write so many pages about over-population...<br /><br />Written well.  Complex characters.  Complex, yet rewarding story.  But doesn't give the reader enough credit for grasping an idea (at least this reader).
0691143692|5.0|Item delivered on time and in excellent condition. No complaints at all. The book is good; pretty detailed. I recommend it for anyone interested in the medieval society of byzantium.
0394721780|5.0|I'd like to give this book 5 stars because of the person behind it. I love Julia Child's engaging character, and it reflects in her cookbook. She is a very determined lady who does things the right way. This becomes obvious when reading her book. Although, I haven't tried any of her recipes yet, there are some which I certainly will try out. I'd recommend the book to anyone with a a sense of humour and enough enthusiasm to try old-fashioned recipes.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|Just writing a review to get the word out that this is worth a lot of watches so it is worth owning!  This movie is a hoot from beginning to end!  Although they should of called the film Tucker & Dale vs. College Kids...that is my only complaint!  My wife and I sat and watched this with our 18 year old college student and we laughed our butts off because we know how teenagers act and we could relate!  Although this is a low budget movie it is pretty well done for the special gore effects.  The one-liners from the two hillbillies is what makes this movie though!  For a horror movie...this one is quite original!  Think Evil Dead movies...if you enjoyed that series....you'll enjoy this one!
1463514581|4.0|Rose is by far one of the most interesting characters I have read of in quite some time. I love that she didn't let herself be dragged down by her history, as many characters would had they been in her position, she always had such a positive outlook on life. Also, she is the sort of character you cannot help but root for and want to befriend in the hopes that some of her positivity will rub off on you. Furthermore, I very much appreciated that Denise was able to give us Rose's history in little bit and pieces (from all sorts of characters, like her sister, aunt, etc.) as opposed to more large information dump- it just made the book flow so much more naturally and made everything seem so much more real.<br /><br />It becomes evident as you read the book that Denise doesn't dilly-dally in her writing, that she writes everything with a purpose, which, too, makes the book flow all the more naturally and makes it a literal page-turner- keeping you engaged (and on the edge of your seat) the entire time while reading it.<br /><br />However, I must admit that the ending did throw me off a bit. I just felt that so much happened in the last bit of the book that I had a hard time keeping track of everything. When I thought the storyline was going in one direction it would go in the complete opposite therefore resulting in me having to reread a bit of the end (but this could have totally been my fault since I literally read this book in one sitting and therefore was most likely tired/ past the point of comprehension by the time I came to the end).<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this book to those looking for a funnier read, albeit a funnier read with quite a bit of action. I cannot tell you how many times I burst out in laughter while reading this book. Also, I challenge you to not start talking in a Southern accent after finishing this book, with all of the characters constantly dropping their \\"g's\\" and saying things like \\"crappy doodles\\".
0465043577|4.0|I am finding these reviews to be almost as informative as the book itself and it is all previously stated better than i can relate. Four stars for making all this information accessible and not overly academic. If you are not an economist however, I suggest reading Taleb's Black Swan first. I read Mandelbrot's book first but lacked perspective, now after reading Black Swan I want to read Misbehavior again!
B005OOSPZO|5.0|This isn't a review of the movie as that is 5 stars however Amazon.UK has the Blu-Ray version without the book for less money and it's 3 minutes more in length which tells me you are paying for the book so you might want to pick up the US version and the British version. I would also like to point out that the packaging is not the best for the DVD. It is enclosed in a paper slip at the back of the booklet and will scratch when pulled out over time. I don't know who the bright guy was who invented this but they could have redesigned the book so that the DVD would fit in a plastic case.
B00267N3DQ|1.0|I bought this gift used for a \\"cheap\\" gift. I figured it wassnt to bed to spend $18 for this blu ray used because new ones are around $30 and up. So I get the package ontime, which I was happy about, open it and there is a Burned copy of the disk is there. I can say they did a great job by putting the picture on the disk and making a decent looking package but the disk when you looked at it was blurry. Also there was 2 disks not three.The outside package was folded and tapped and it had written on the back of it kodak paper. Really now, when did kodak start making the movie covers for disney? Ill answer it for you, they didnt. I didnt bother playing the disk because it wassnt a orginal Disney blu ray. How can someone have the balls to burn disk make a make shift case for it and try to pass it off as a deal. If I paid $2 bucks for the rip off I eat my loss, but $18 your out of your mind. Product was returned.
B002NUULNG|2.0|I originally picked this up because it was supposed to be an \\"upgraded and enhanced\\", and hoped it would be beautiful on Blu-ray.  80% of it was.  The enhanced animation was beautiful.  The colors were vibrant and the picture was great.  The biggest sticking point, which immediately dropped my review from 5 stars to 2 (I would've given it a 2.5 if I could), was the CG animation that replaced scenes that were done spectacularly in the original DVD.  I've seen better CG in videogames than what was on display, and I actually got upset enough to start screaming at my T.V.  The difference is so absolutely jarring that it becomes a major distraction.  To put it into perspective, think of the stuff that was tacked on to the original Star Wars trilogy when Lucas re-released it.  Yeah it's that bad.  GITS is one of my favorite animes, hands down.  The original animation is still a sight to see, and the story is complex, mature, and absolutely spectacular.  It's one of the few animes that would do well in a full U.S. theatrical release.  I really don't feel that this version deserves the 4 star rating it has, it deserves at the most an overall 3, which is the other reason I'm giving it a 2.  I'm hoping and praying that they release a 3.0 with the original animation enhanced, and throw out the CG crap.  ONLY buy this if you don't already own it on DVD, and/or can stomach some extremely poorly made and executed CG scenes.  If you have the original DVD, and consider yourself to be a purist, AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS!.
0316098329|5.0|It took me a little while to get into this, but once I did I was hooked! The story is not as dismal as the premise may sound. Highly recommend it!
0930289234|5.0|Amazing. I love the approach to so many different characters, all with their mistakes and sins but never without some moments where you have no choice but to sympathize. Every single panel and every single word was clearly thought out and only make the story take you deeper after each read.<br />I was able to find a used one (but still in great condition) for less than 10 dollars. There really isn't much more I could have asked for haha.

055299703X|4.0|Bill Bryson's more recent books, in particular Down Under and The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, display a gentle wistfulness, a geniality, that was missing from his earlier books.  His earlier writing was characterized by a combination of the humor of Dave Barry (which I enjoyed) and the self-absorbed whining of Paul Theroux (which I did not).  Down Under is Bryson's description of several trips he took to Australia.  He starts with a long train ride in search of The Outback.  His description of Broken Hill, a small town on the edge of the desert near the start of his journey, is typically appealing:  \\"Broken Hill was a positively delightful little community--clean, trim, cheerfully prosperous.  Unfortunately this was not at all what we wanted.  We wanted proper outback.....This wasn't the outback at all.  This was Guildford with the heat turned up.\\"   Down Under is readable and gently funny.  It is worthy of the compliment due the best travel books--it makes the reader want to visit Australia, see the country and meet the people.

B005LZW8FO|5.0|Finally, a movie that displays a breath of fresh air into modern day cinema. I was glued to the story line, its related characters and paticularly how the movie displayed both extreme ranges of human tragedy to our abilities to evolve love and forgiveness from our personal actions. The story was so believable that I felt (literally) the pain and anguish early in the beginning but also shared in the peace originating from her altruism displayed in the latter part of the relationship that formed unexpectedly. I do not want to in any way give away any significant part of the characters and their specific roles as I personally believe it would take away from the emotionional experience of each individual viewer. I know this must come across sounding odd, but I sincerely believe you will find the (personal)journey it projects so worth while during its evolution that at least everyone who chooses to watch this beautiful adaptation will not regret their own personal experience. I would love to see many, many more movies of this caliber in the near future. Truly designed to inspire, force viewers into seeing their own humanistic side while leaving us thinking how each of us could contribute in making our world a much better place.

B0018M6J90|5.0|Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day is a charming movie set in London at the start of World War II.  It is a fast moving action picture of romantic rivals, amusing mistakes, a stalwart heroine, and an unexpected romantic hero.
0143038095|4.0|Technically this wasn't the last book I read. I read Confessions of a Shopaholic most recently, and really liked it. I needed a light read after the last several books I've read had characters with cancer - I love heavy drama, but need an escape from reality once in a while too. Before that I'd been reading Bodily Harm by Margaret Atwood, a book I'd had forever. I'd gotten to page 186 when I found it had been bound wrong - there was a segment that repeated after page 186 and then a gap of probably 20 pages, so I got all that way and couldn't finish it. I would have exchanged it at Powell's, but wasn't really that into it anyway.<br /><br />So, on to the Joy Luck Club. I tend to love books about Chinese culture and especially tales about women. This was right up my alley. The book tells the story of four sets of mothers and daughters. The mothers were all born in China and the daughters all born in America.<br /><br />The book starts with the mother that started the Joy Luck Club having recently passed away. The Joy Luck Club is a gathering of four women to play mah jong (and eat, gossip, etc.). Each chapter is told from a mother or daughter's perspective. The mother's stories all tell of their past in China, and evolve into their current relationships with their daughters. The daughter's stories tell of their upbringing in the U.S. that shaped their current lives (their current relationships with their mothers, kids, husbands/lovers, their careers, etc.).<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, but wouldn't say it was one of my favorites. I enjoyed Snowflower and the Secret Fan more (recently been made into a movie). I found it a bit confusing to keep track of the characters. I had to back track a lot to remember who was who. The stories were all really good on their own, although they didn't overlap as much as you'd expect. But maybe I was a little more distracted with a new baby? It may have been me, not the book.
B004A9F9ZI|1.0|I ordered this and expected a dvd in the mail. Make sure you know what your getting this isnt a dvd it down loads on your computer and you cant watch it on your tv unless you can hook it up to the internet. This is a major hassle i ended up just going back and buying it agian on dvd. Buy The Walking Dead on dvd NOT AMAZON UNBOX VIDEO!
0307887960|5.0|I am a 47 yr. old woman going through menopause. this life style change(diet) was my last effort at weight control. Atkins didn't make since because of all the fat allowed. I hate counting ANYTHING!<br />I liked the concept of this one because it restricted the sodium & fat (which makes sence) and after the protein phase you get veggies you just have to wait for the fruit. If you want to lose weight fast and be done with it this diet is not for you. At first it is kinda fast but levels out when adding veggies.<br />It has taught me to be aware of what and how much I eat and the importance of bran, fruit & veggies. Some people might have trouble with constipation but YOU HAVE TO DRINK LOTS OF WATER. If you are not much of a fan of water, get 0 calorie flavoring to add to it. I have lost 30 lbs. in 4 months. I had to skip to the 3rd phase because I coldn't go anymore without fruit. I have been doing this for 1 1/2 months and have hit a plataue. i will go back on protein for 5 days to kick start it again then back to the 3rd phase. Holidays have stumbled me so that is the reason. I would recommend this life style change. The book is a must have tool. You will referre back to it, time and time again.
0938045695|1.0|Useless book.  Waste of money.  Gives a nice history of the kettle bell but what's the point of that.  I need to know the excises.  And this book doesn't deliver.
0385534639|3.0|I read a lot of reviews on this book before deciding to read it. And I wish I would have listened to the readers that said this was a slow read. It was tedious trying to get through the extremely detailed pages. The Storyline was interesting and inventive but the book doesn't start to pick up until 200 pages in.   I would skip this book and go to some other books that are quick paced and more fulfilling like:  Divergent  Die For me  Delirium  Wings series  Falling under  Firelight  poison study  Hunger games

B004OZOTSQ|4.0|Extremely simply and easy to use.  Not the most secure interface, but acceptable for home use where all my network shares are writable anyways.  Would give it 5 stars if I could move a file on the device without deleting it and re-uploading it.  Sort of assumed this would be part of the Pro package.

B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I ordered this case with my Fire and received it almost three weeks ago.  It's a fantastic COVER for the Fire but I find it lacking when it comes to using it as a stand (which it purports to be).  The ridge that holds the case upright doesn't lock in (so that if you aren't using it on a perfectly still platform, it slips out) and it only allows a 75 degree angle, and not a more laid back 30 degree angle (which is optimal if you are using it on, say, an airplane tray).  If you are only looking for a way to transport your Fire safely and without much extra weight, this is the case for you.  If you want to also use it to allow for two hand use (or no hand use) of the Fire, I would look elsewhere (actually, I am looking elsewhere, but haven't had any luck yet...).
0307272702|3.0|I expected more than I received from this book. I was hoping for recipes and more practical tips. What I received was more along the lines of a scholarly, updated version of Dr. Atkins' research - essentially that carbohydrates and sugars are making us fat.<br /><br />I wish that I could say that I enjoyed the book or would recommend it, but I wouldn't. There are a lot of other books out there on the subject that are more enjoyable and more practical to read.

I can add as many cities as I want which makes it super easy for me to see how the weather is at the Mt for snowboarding or see how the weather is for the parents back home or of course see how it will be wherever I find myself. its free, easy to use and I don't have to be searching through tons of websites to get what I need to see.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|Everybody knows the movie is fantastic, and I'm sure the transfer to blu-ray is equally as impressive, but I received this product with a giant puncture mark through the case.  There was no damage to the box, so I assume it had to be due to how the movie was handled in the warehouse.  It literally looks like somebody attacked it with a screwdriver.  Luckily it didn't damage the disks, but regardless it's still annoying.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I had the first 2 books for a while before I actually ever read them. I'd started the first one, Uglies, a couple times but couldn't really get into it. I decided to give it another chance and this time just started where I left off the last time. I'm really glad I did pick it up again because I really enjoyed it and the rest of the trilogy. I really like how it's set in the future, but it alludes to the 'Rusties', which is what they call the people of the past, which I presume is right about this time. I think the author did a really good job of mixing the parts of the story without putting too much emphasis on one. There's some romance, but the books not centered around it so you get a good taste of the romance but you're not trudging through Tally (the main character) obsessing over a guy like other books tend to do. Also, there's lots of talk about how the Rusties destroyed nature, didn't recycle, used too much oil, etc. and it really makes you think about what we're doing to our planet. Of course, that's what the author intended and he really did a good job of that. And I really think the whole operation-to-be-pretty thing is just brilliant. You also get the controlling, futuristic society but in this case, the people in the city aren't really aware how controlling it actually is. And the writing was very well done. Lots of imagery. Overall, I really enjoyed the series and I would recommend this book to anyone.
B005K17RU0|5.0|the app makes it easy to tell what the temp is and feels like at different hours and days of week. its one of the apps I check before I leave the house
B000FC2PKG|5.0|I just have to say, this was the first book by this author that I have read. I can't wait to download the rest in this series. I was intrigued from page 1 and even when I had to set it down, I couldn't wait to get back to it. Other people have already divulged plot information so I won't repeat any of it. Suffice to say, this was an excellent book.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|I decided to review POLTERGEIST mostly because i know this movie became a classic and then a cult throughout the years but its also a perfect example of what i call fantasy/horror. It is a perfect match between  horror AND fantasy....It is also another example of an epic artistic collaboration between director TOBE HOOPER (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Toolbox Murders) and Legendary writor /director STEVEN SPIELBERG from  which i don't even need to quote films.<br /><br />Another reason would definitely be Heather....Even today in 2011, I still have lots of questions from friends and entourage regarding my views on THE EXORCIST and that little possessed girl who died making the movie...every time i have to explain that NO, they are not talking about the exorcist, they are talking about Heather O Rourke in POLTERGEIST. YES, Linda Blair from THE EXORCIST is alive and well!! Sometimes still making appearance in movies!!! Some say that Heather , the cast and the set were  cursed because they were making a movie about ghosts and bad spirits, some still believe that's the reason why she died........<br /><br />Poltergeist is another movie that got me hooked right away and marked my childhood. I must've been the same age as heather when i first saw it, or maybe a year or 2 older. She became a friend right away, a friend that would help me not to be scared throughout the movie, i was very scared of ghosts and monsters at that age but i was also fascinated by it at the same time. I must've figured out this cute little girl would probably take care of all undesired ghosts and help me watch the whole thing without being scared! And she kinda did in a way....the magic aspect of this movie got me hooked for the whole ride!!.<br /><br />With poltergeist 2 and 3 that followed a few years later and local TV station playing all of them at least once every year , me and my sister quickly got to know heather (\\"Carol Ann\\" in the movie) and poltergeist. She was kinda like a heroine to us, just like what ALICE became for me a few years later in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 - THE DREAM MASTER.<br /><br />The quality of the film is exceptional, it is a very good story that will get you hooked pretty quickly, the acting is good and you actually get to care about them!!!. As for action and suspense and surprises this one is definitely a winner in my book!!! Special effects are great! And we even have some truly sad and compelling moments in there too. This remastered version is fantastic!!! A few minutes in the movie and you won't even be able to tell it was actually done in 1982!!!!!<br /><br />To end my review, i would definitely say that this is a real classic!!!! A must have!!! Especially if you've never seen it!!!. Heather..(or Carol Ann)..will always be in my heart and remembered for this excellent movie that was also part of my fantasy/horror addiction...(which i don't want to get rid of...lol)............So thank you heather for those magic moments!!!.......RIP...<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!!me a few years later in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 - THE DREAM MASTER.

0786891416|1.0|I don't understand the high reviews for this book. I couldn't make it past the first 25 or so pages because it was so poorly written and just wooden. It became obvious to me in just those first pages that this was not so much a novel as an extended ad for a number of brand-name products that are mentioned prominently and described in detail as part of the narrative, even though they are useless in driving the story or developing the characters. I see enough commercials on television; I don't need to waste my reading time on them.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I have a large collection of flac files on my computer which I play through Foobar2000.  When I plug the built-in sound card into my stereo receiver, a get an electrical feedback hum. The computer (a Dell Zino) also generates a lot of low level rumbly noises which ruins listening to soft passages. (Bad Zino!)   Since my computer has an optical, toslink output, I'd thought I would try this little DAC. Running the sound from the optical out through this little DAC and into my stereo receiver and guess what,  both the electrical hum and the rumbly noise are gone. I can listen to my flac files through my big stereo system! WaHoo!!  Not bad for such an inexpensive DAC.  Update Dec26, 2011  I have been listening to this little DAC for about a month and am very pleased with the sound quality.  It plays 16/44 quality flac files, 24/96 flac files & 25/192 flac files beautifully. The only con about this unit is it makes a soft \\"click\\" noise when the track changes. At first this irritated me but I quickly learned to not notice it.

B004SIP7XK|4.0|There was a lot to like in this taut and generally entertaining tale. It raised good questions, and raised them well. None of that \\"discussion about...\\" nonsense where no opinion about the theme is proposed. Thoughtful and challenging indeed. And the screen reeked of the grubby, the cheap, the crass, the violent and the dangerous. I have seen few movies where I said as often as I did here, \\"Boy, I'm glad I don't live there.\\" These were nasty people who have made bad choices and suffer the consequences of their behavior. A place where no one was trustworthy, and strangers were not welcome. This all worked wonderfully. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman were pros who knew what to do, and Amy Ryan, so wonderful in \\"The Wire\\", was utterly convincing and absolutely unrelenting as a shallow, stupid, foul, and arrogant mother.<br /><br />So, what didn't work? Well, unfortunately, Casey Affleck, a nice enough guy, just could not pull off the brooding, conflicted protagonist. His boyish appearance, used unsuccessfully as a plot device, made the struggles he endured seem off-kilter. This role needed someone with more snarl, more snap, more depth. I repeatedly thought of Bogart in \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"Casablanca\\", a tough but good man trying to do what's right. No one could stare without speaking as Bogart could. Casey was not close. And he<br />had been asked to be so.<br /><br />One of the commonly voiced complaints about contemporary actors is how there are no grown-ups. They all seem like boys, even when playing men. And that was terribly true here. This young man sounded like a kid. He was never man enough to do what this character did, and that discord was, for me, a nagging flaw.

B005HNG1S0|2.0|I do not understand the raves this disc has been receiving.  To my ears the recorded sound is harsh, boxy, and although the winds sound excellent the strings sound steely and hard.  The piano sound is excessively reverberant and clangy.  As far as the playing goes, Ms. Grimaud simply does not understand Mozart's piano style; she is stiff in her phrasing even with her willful rubatos, pauses, and decrescendos at he end of phrases.  She lacks elegance, nuance, and dare I say it: beauty.  Perhaps this is due to the horrid piano sound captured by the DGG engineers.  As to her \\"controversial\\" playing of the Andante (Mozart's tempo marking) of K.488 in a Molto Adagio tempo, for me it simply does not work; the effect is not of greater profundity or emotion but rather sluggishness--the music seems to fall apart under her fingers.  Artur Schnabel made the same error in his recording of the concerto K.467, playing the Andante as Adagio--despite his gifts the music simply does not work at that tempo.  I am not reflexively opposed to fresh approaches to traditional playing of the classics, but it must serve the music, not distort it.  I have not heard Ms. Grimaud's other recordings, and based on this one, I have no wish to.  When it comes to Mozart I will turn to Schiff, Brendel, Goode, and Bilson.
B006GLQIVC|3.0|i agree with the other Amazon reviewers that the show got a bit too far off course this episode. It opened by having the ghost of Elizabeth Short, the unsolved LA murder victim from more than 50 years ago, open the episode as a ghost, walking into the house for a dental appointment.  If we could have just used her and not digressed with others as well, it would have been fine.  However, we went spinning off into many other directions as well.<br /><br />The spin I liked the least is that we are going to get an anti christ baby because the wife is bringing forth the baby of a spirit. The other baby is her husband's so that baby will be normal.  Meanwhile, Jessica Lange is getting ready for the babies in a rather deranged fashioned, while also entertaining a toy boy.  This toy boy gets involved with the ghost of the young mistress as he and Lange start fighting over these babies. I cannot stand this young mistress ghost. Every time she comes on camera the show starts going downhill.  Obviously we can't just kill her off as that already took place and we've still got her. But there must be some other way of getting rid of her.
1577314808|1.0|Eckhart Tolle and others who preach this new age spirituality are dangerous.  His teachings afford people the opportunity to deny their wrongdoings and hurtful acts to others and gives them a pass to do what makes them happy without regards to other people, their needs and feelings.<br /><br />If Eckhart Tolle is such a spiritual man, why is he charging people money to read and hear his misleading practices?  Beware and don't fall for this.  Also, don't line the pockets of an individual who is leading many people astray. Many thanks to Oprah Winfrey for unleashing this fake spiritual fraud on others.<br /><br />This crap only works if everyone in a house is willing to fall for it.

B0064NTZKI|5.0|This is an excellent documentary about Allen's entire career.  There are many, many film clips and they are all choice highlights from his films.  Interspersed with these clips are interview segments with Allen present day and during earlier days.  There are also clips of mini interviews with the people with whom he has worked, including Tony Roberts, Diane Keaton, Scarlett Johannsen, John Cusack, Owen Wilson, Mariel Hemingway, Gordon Willis, Marshall Brickmann, Martin Scorsese, his sister Letty Aronson, now his producer, Dick Cavett and so forth.  Although Mia Farrow is covered, she does not participate in any way since they have never resumed contact in any way. She was, of course, Allen's other major leading lady but he ended up having an affair and marrying her adopted daughter years ago.<br /><br />Even though I have seen every single one of his movies, I really liked the choice of film clips presented here.  It was very enjoyable to see them and to learn some of the tidbits about what else was going on while making them.  Everyone contributed some major insight about the film clip which was unknown to us before.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the way he present day took us to his old school or walked down the street with his sister and they talked to present New Yorkers.  There was even old footage shown of his parents who finally died near the century mark.<br /><br />Although the focus was on the work, there was enough of a human dimension presented here to make this a very important summing up of a creative life while the creator is still around to share it.  If you love his work, you need this film in your collection.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B004EPYZPS|2.0|Pinch me if you haven't seen most of these scripts before:  (1.) Military has secret alien project.   (2.) Alien escapes.  (3.) From, usually a military escort like a convoy, or train, or ship.   (4.) Alien looks like any combination of the following (in this case - all): Predator, E.T., Alien.   (5.) Poor alien is misunderstood. Needs better make-up or a Victoria's Secret casting resumé.  (6.) The military (or any enforcement agency) is always portrayed as dumb-assess.   (7.) Scientists look the same today as they did in the '40s, '50s ... Although I know an athletic female astrophysics student at Yale who's hot. Come on, casting director evolve into the 21st century.   (8.) Usually one notable CGI scene which in this case is the train wreck.   (9.) As usual the teens need to show the adults what dumb ... they are and save the world.   (10.) Alien is anatomically and biophysically impossible most likely because the writers, directors and producers have zero interest in taking advantage of an educational opportunity. Alien spaceship violates not only every conceivable physical law but is illogical as well. If it's familiar it sells! Money, money, money!  (11.) Everybody lives happily ever after. Alien gets her modeling contract.

B004IZMQI2|1.0|This book just not very good unless you're very spiritual or religious. The author talks way too much about angles to make any sense.  Even if you try to look past the religious stuff, there is not really any useful tips on how to win the creative battle, as the author calls it. Unless you like to pray.  I suppose I wasn't the target audience, but hard to know without reading it.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I've previously purchased [[ASIN:6302383455 Godfather 1902-1959 Complete Epic [VHS]]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXAA The Godfather Collection (The Godfather / The Godfather: Part II / The Godfather: Part III)]], so shelling out another $60...despite the great reviews I'd read about the restoration on Godfather I and II...wasn't something I'd planned to do. But Amazon offered a \\"Black Friday\\" price on the set that was almost too good to be true and I went for it. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The picture on the restored films is warm and vibrant. I didn't do a side-by-side comparison with the DVDs from the 2001 set, but that's not really necessary. Even the dark scenes have a clarity and definition that I don't remember in earlier versions.<br /><br />It's also nice to have the films on single DVDs. I understand technical restrictions, quality control and the need to occasionally split feature films across multiple discs, but it's nice to be able to put the DVD in and watch it, period.<br /><br />The sound is excellent, but I don't have an audiophile setup. Sounds great on my system, so that's all that matters to me.<br /><br />I just received this and have watched the two restored films but have not yet seen the new documentaries. It was a wise marketing decision to carry over all of the \\"bonus\\" content from the 2001 set in addition to the three new documentaries.<br /><br />And Godfather III? Well, it's still Godfather III, isn't it? Often referred to as \\"misunderstood,\\" that may be true. I've always enjoyed Joe Mantegna's performance, and the saga does benefit from \\"closure,\\" but...well, it is what it is. The real draw here is the new versions of the first two films, which are two of the greatest films in the history of cinema...as \\"essential\\" as essential gets.<br /><br />My only caveat is to do what I did...keep an eye on the price and when the iron's hot, strike.

B006GLQIVC|5.0|SPOOKY LITTLE GIRL episode.   This show is magnificent.  This episode is not.  In fact, it's an annoying disappointment.  Everyone following the series went into this episode wanting to know more about Tate and Violet-- mostly Tate.  We wanted more of the story we'd been following.  But there's almost NO Tate in this episode.  The show takes a dramatic, inexplicable, and unwelcome departure from the story line to accommodate a guest appearance.  I'm still too ticked off about the whole thing to mention the guest's name.  Her presence was unnecessary and did nothing to further the story.  The appearance reduced the show to an episode of Scooby Doo and I hated it.  There were some good parts of the show, but the precious time lost to showcasing the guest really put a bad spin on the whole thing.  Hayden was wickedly awesome (as usual).  Jessica Lange takes Constance over the top with her masterful portrayal of a tortured, desperate woman.  Really an excellent show.  Again, just a bad and frustrating episode.  Enough with the guest stars.  Give us what we want: Tate, Violet, Vivian, Ben, Constance, Addie, Moira, Luke, Larry, Nora & the Surgeon, Infantata, Hayden, Marcy, Troy, Brian and the rest of the crazies we love and can't get enough of.    Elizabeth Short?  Really?  Cut the crap, Murphy.

B001YV502C|5.0|I've had this movie on DVD for years, but after replacing my home theater system with one that handled all the new high definition sound formats as well as high definition video.  No \\"upconversion\\" of a DVD will ever hold up against a well produced blu ray disc, and this disc is well produced.  The sound is amazingly good.  Every explosion and every gunshot will having you ducking for cover.<br /><br />I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it in a theater.  I feel I have to take issue with those who take issue with what they claim is \\"left-wing politics\\".  It isn't politics you are seeing in the movie.  It is a people that have given up any and all hope for the future.  Under such circumstances it isn't strange that they should decide they didn't want to support anyone who \\"isn't us\\".  That isn't politics, it is the darker side of humanity that a lot of us don't want to admit exists.  This movie is a study of people and its characters are extremely well portrayed.  And for those who were so annoyed with the blood spatter on the camera lens for a while, it gave a feeling of being there...reality.<br /><br />Some find this movie depressing.  I was heartened by seeing some who would risk all to do good things.  It is something I don't expect.
0385341008|5.0|A lovely story of friendship, courage, faith, and love. The history was interesting, the characters charming, and the writing was enjoyable.
B0032KNA4I|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I hated it...because the science was so screwed up and Roland Emmerich was still clueless as the the characteristics and capabilities of the aircraft the film portrayed.  The second time, not so much...it was, after all an action/disaster movie with good special effects.  Then I got a new home theater system and figured this would be a good movie to try it out on.  Well, its no surprise that the effects are still good and the sound is fantastic, without being over the top.  A funny thing happened.  I started looking at the characters and realized they were believable.  Once you look at the people, the movie comes together and becomes very enjoyable.<br /><br />Are there flaws?  You bet.  A student pilot is not going to get into a twin engine aircraft he has never flown before and take off a minute later.  He is certainly not going to fly from Santa Monica to downtown Los Angeles and still be lower than the US Bank building.  The cargo plane called an Antonov 500 in the movie, is actually an Antonov An-225 and isn't capable of a number of the maneuvers shown in the movie.  Also, it is referred to as a Russian plane, when it is actually made in Ukraine.  I used to think things were important.  I'm reminded of two other movies, Armageddon and Deep Impact.  The former had lousy science and absurd space shuttle flying, but you gave a damn about the characters.  The latter had pretty good science, but lackluster characters.  Armageddon was the winner.  So is 2012.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey is a wonderfully crafted series with great characters and a good choice of actors/actresses playing the roles.  Maggie Smith plays her part so well, as really do most of the cast.  I love the fact that you must listen so that you catch the subtle moments of humour, sometimes quite unexpected.  So the Series is great, but the information provided is lacking.  IE as mentioned in some other reviews, neither the packing nor the disc list the name of the episodes on the packing or the disc.  This is extremely annoying and also I feel quite sloppy.  Perhaps those who make the decisions on the written information provided could take a leaf out of \\"Sailor\\", or \\"Lewis\\" who provide good written information.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Since this book was so awesome,My Chickie, Rhonda and I did a joint review.<br /><br />Bitter Sweet Love!<br /><br />Rhonda: This book was simply wonderful!!! Not since Perfect Chemistry has a Young Adult book captured my attention this way.  On a whim I opened this book up to finally read it, and WOW, I was hooked from the opening pages.  This was such an emotional journey of ups and downs, and I was constantly on edge waiting for that detrimental moment when everything was truly going to go up in flames.<br /><br />Elena: That is so true Rhonda! I'm a huge \\"Funtes Brothers\\" Fan, so I had to jump on Rhonda's  wagon and read this novel.Especially when she was teasing me on how good the book is. Lol!! She did not disappoint with this Rec. It's PERFECTION! Exactly what I like to read in a YA novel.<br /><br />Rhonda: Abby Abernathy is running from her past in every way, from her parentage, to who she is.  She and her best friend America run off to Eastern University, where she can start fresh.  And almost immediately she runs straight into Travis Maddox, who smacks of everything she's running from. Abby already knows the scoop on Travis and what a ho dog he is. Travis is a bad boy in every sense,  he's doesn't hide what he is, and has no shame... at all!!! He fights in a traveling fight ring called The Circle where bets are made, and this is how how makes his living.<br /><br />Elena: This couple will leave your draw dropping with their confusing relationship. Abby sees right through Travis and knows the real man he is and always will be. She promises herself not to fall for his charms. But who can't?  Rhonda and I gushed over his nickname for Abby, \\"Pigeon\\" That says a whole lot. Lol!! Travis is an irresistible cutie pie! Travis isn't used to the hard-to get chicks, he's more of a chick magnet, no one refuses him. Except, now  he's met his challenge, Abby. Abby changes Travis in so many ways, but at times she's too dumb to realize she's truly special to him.<br /><br />Rhonda:  I agree Elena,  Travis and Abby are completely dysfunctional, but so perfect together.  They had my emotions in a state of chaos all the time, they had my heart breaking on several occasions for each other. I was angry with both of them on several occasions but my heart just kept rooting for them to finally get their act together even when there was one obstacle after another constantly being thrown in their way, and at times they were their own worst enemy.<br /><br />Elena: Friendships, Heartaches, Tears, Love, Devotion, you name it,this book will throw it at you in such a manner you'll have a Love / Hate relationship with  the characters and enjoy the plot of the story just because it made your toes curl.<br /><br />Rhonda:  You are so right Elena, there were times when I didn't think my heart could take anymore, but I was so in love with the story and characters that I had to keep going because I just had to know what was going to happen.  Jamie McGuire knocked this one out of the park!  One of the best YA novels I've ever read, and I must give a shout out to the secondary characters, Shep and America.  These two were so much fun and I think they gave the story a good balance.<br /><br />Elena: Trust me,you don't know what you're missing till you've read the novel and realize you can't bookmark your page in fear you'll miss what's gonna happen next. It'll suck you in and spit you out feeling whole. I Loved It!ysfunctional, but so perfect together.

B004ZJZQH4|1.0|This disc is the most anti-consumer user-hostile Blu-Ray (or DVD, for that matter) I have ever encountered. People should not have to skip through not 1, not 2, not 3 but FOUR(!!) previews to watch the movie they paid for. Not only that, but by the time you get to the main menu you'll be treated to - you guessed it - MORE ADVERTISING!!! What makes a bad situation even worse is all the other crap that you have to wade through to get to the movie. Here's what happens after you load the disc into your player:  *Progress (loading) indicator (For BD Live?)  *Animated Universal Pictures logo  *Notification that your player is \\"Loading a fresh preview from the internet\\"  *Preview 1  *Preview 2  *Preview 3  *Preview 4  *Menu asking you to select your language  *FBI Anti-piracy warning  *Disclaimer: \\"The views and opinions expressed in the interviews and/or commentaries are solely of the individuals...\\"  *MPAA rating  *Disclaimer: \\"Availability of network-related features subject to change...\\"  *Animated BD logo  *Apollo 13 Main menu (displaying ads for other Universal BD movies, the \\"ticker\\")  This is the kind of consumer-hostile design which turns people to download movies from the internet. When I load a movie into my player, I want to be taken directly to the main menu with a minimum of fuss. I paid for convenience and I didn't get it. Had I known this disc was authored this way, I would not have purchased it. Help discourage this kind of behavior by NOT purchasing this disc.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|I thought new authors had learned not to write in first person-present tense.<br /><br />In present tense, one informs on events that are happenning.<br /><br />One cannot write in present tense about past events, only future or planned events.<br /><br />One could say that some people will read anything, I mean the readers who look at the words and don't READ the story, they are the sort of people who wouldn't know a dangling participle if you slapped them in the face with one.<br /><br />I don't and I never will read and enjoy a book written this way.<br /><br />Not only that, the story, at the start, convoluted by the badly mixed tenses, was written in a way that did not interest me in the least.<br /><br />But then again, if kids like it then let them read it, as they don't know any better, but it will confuse their attempt at writing.<br /><br />As for me, it didn't \\"hook\\" me, or \\"pull me in\\". I could not identify with the character because of the hopping around with the tenses -<br /><br />\\"When I wake up the other side of the bed is cold.\\"<br />\\"I woke up and reached out,the other side of the bed was cold.\\"<br /><br />Do you see the difference?<br /><br />The difference is in the quality of writing.<br /><br />But then again, this was written for kids who are still learning to read.<br /><br />On the upside, the plot was good, and I look forward to reading this in past perfect, and then I could recommend it to all my friends on facbook and the other thirty-two sites. Until then...<br /><br />By the way, does anybody know in which tense I am writing?
B001UV4XIS|1.0|The movie is fine, but if you want the digital copy for your Ipad, or other IOS device, forget about buying this.  unlike other digital copies that we have come to expect from the movie studios, the Ultraviolet copy is terrible.  Downloading a 2GB file took 3.5 hours.  in comparison the same size file through itune to about 2 minutes.  Loading the Flixster software is slow awkward, and sems to be very invasive, (read the things it requires you to share to load the software)  I plan on deleting it here.    If the download were merely the MPEG4 movie that it's extension claims it is, I would be willing to put up with the terrible download, and crappy software interface, but it isn't.  It has proprietary copy protection built in, so you can only play it in the flixster window.   If you are looking for the digital copy, don't waster your money on the blue ray bundle, just download the itunes version.

0062112430|5.0|First Impressions: I read Delirium when it was first released back in January of this year, but I didn't have my blog then so I never wrote a review for it. I recently was given Pandemonium, the second book in the trilogy for review, so I thought it would finally get around to writing a review for Delirium. I did a quick re-read to freshen up my memory, not that I really needed to, but honestly I loved this book so I didn't mind! It was one of my favorite books I read this year, and before I go any further, if you haven't read it, you really need to because it is wonderful!!<br /><br />First 50 Pages: Delirium was one of the very first dystopian books that I read besides The Hunger Games and I think that it was the cause of my love for the genre. The first 50 pages of this book really hooked me right in both times I read it and I loved the setting and the premise of the story line. The world Oliver had created wasn't too different from the world we live in now, yet it is still unique. The author uses an amazing amount of detail and her imagery and world-building skills are fantastic. It was so easy to become completely absorbed into the main character, Lena's world. I love dystopians that doesn't seem far-fetched and it was easy for me to visualize most of the things in the story actually happening in real life. So, that is a major plus in my eyes.<br /><br />Characters & Plot: The basic story line revolves around Lena, who feels comfortable in her safe and secure bubble of a government-managed United States. She knows what to expect to happen in her future and everything will be chosen for her: her college, her career, and future husband, and even how many children they will one day have. Once Lena turns 18, she will have a procedure done to cure her of love. Yes, love. In this world, love is a disease and it is thought that it is the cause of just about everything that has ever gone wrong. All people are cured of the love disease, except for people called \\"invalids\\" or sympathizers of those \\"infected\\" with the love disease. Lena in the beginning of the story completely believes that love is exactly that, nothing more than a nasty disease that she cannot wait to be completely protected against and she even counts down the days to her own procedure. Lena's mother suffered and died because of the disease, and Lena's worst fear is of turning into her mother, who committed suicide.<br /><br />Then she meets Alex, a strange and kind of mysterious young man close to her own age 95 days before her procedure. In short, everything Lena thought she believed about the world she lived in, and even her own past, is thrown all out of wack. This book isn't fast-paced. It takes its good old time to get going, but I didn't mind because it left plenty of room for world-building and time to connect with each of the characters.<br /><br />I loved the transformation Lena takes in the book! She starts out as a character that really relies on everything being predictable, and she was predictable. She did exactly what she was told with no questions asked. She wasn't a risk taker and she knew, and accepted, what her future would be. She was like a caged animal, in fact, she pretty much was a caged animal. By the end of the book, she is anything but predictable. She takes chances. She has a chance at a real life and she makes her own choices. Were the choices she made the right choices? Well, I guess I will find out in the next book. This book ends with a major cliffhanger that left me screaming for more.<br /><br />I usually don't care for too much romance in books, but this time it was acceptable and expected deeming the circumstances. I loved the chemistry between Lena and Alex and the risks and lengths they take to stay together. It kind of reminded me of William Shakespeare's, \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" In fact, the play was referred to quite a few times in the story, which I adored because it is one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />Hana was also aninteresting character who makes a great transformation. She, unlike Lena, starts off as a bit of a wild-child. She takes the risks Lena had a hard time taking, and by the end of the book she turns out to be more like Lena was. She was only able to push herself to a certain limit, but she was content with what her future would be in the regulated world. I'm interested to see if she will continue to be on the same path in the next book.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: This book is absolutely incredible. I have nothing negative to say about Delirium, if anything, some people may find the pacing a tad slow but for me it was perfect. I have a feeling that Pandemonium is going to be more action packed because of how Delirium ended. I very, very highly recommend picking this book up!

0451450523|5.0|This book is hauntingly beautiful. Beagle somehow captures the beauty of his unicorn in the eyes of the creatures around her, except for humans, who don't usually recognize her.  What is amazing, is how she is flawed, taking centuries to realize she is the only one left and almost not caring enough to seek out where they have gone.  Schmendrick is also flawed, trying so hard to do some \\"real\\" magic, causing more trouble than he solves (almost).  Molly Grue is the most innocent, although she is grimy & gritty and one hard woman.  At least she, of all the other characters, keeps a grip on what's going on and The Plan.<br /><br />Each character grows and changes... except, maybe, the vain spider.
0439023513|5.0|The conclusion to The Hunger Games trilogy is every bit as shocking and stunning as the first two books.  I've never described a book as a rollercoaster, but this one truly is. The entire trilogy is.  In this book, Katniss must come to terms with the last line of Catching Fire; \\"There is no District 12.\\"  This is the book where the rebellion finally hits high-gear. But as the book unfolds, Katniss begins to wonder if the alternative to the Capitol is much better.  Although some aspects of Collins' writing bothered me slightly- some things are glossed over a little conveniently glossed over, like how Katniss communicates with an Avox- a man who has had his tongue cut out, and she's often drugged and put to sleep when she's angry, or upset, and all that emotion is glossed over, and left for her to deal with a few days later, or when she comes around, the decisions she found difficult have been made.  Katniss is a slightly changed character, she almost seems to have PTSD in this book. It makes sense, when you think about what she's been through, but it's not the same person readers would have fallen in love with in The Hunger Games, but it's a logical progression for her character.  All that aside, Mockingjay is outstanding. It takes a slightly unexpected turn, but it all makes perfect sense given the events in the previous two books.   Any hope readers had throughout this book is stripped away by the time they're done. However, it's as grisly, nasty war, and nasty grisly deeds are part of that. It was always going to happen, after Katniss volunteered for Prim.  Yes, this book is dark, and grim, and relentless and nasty. So is war, which is the point Collins is making. Katniss exchanges one army for another, as it were, and finds herself being used in the same way, just by different people. The whole point is that the soldiers on either side of an army are essentially the same, and doesn't that make war pointless?  The choice we've all been waiting for her to make- thechoice between Peeta and Gale, is, as it turns out, almost inconsequential when compared to the choice she ends up making in the end.  I think a lot of people reading this book were hoping for a fairytale ending, and that's why they were disappointed. But it's war, few wars have happy endings.  I genuinely was nearly in tears at the end of this book. It's just brilliant.  For those of you who think this book is unsuitable for YA readers, have a little faith. So much YA fiction is trivial, as though all of life is rainbows and bunnies. I didn't read YA fiction when I was younger for that reason, it was unrealistic and soppy. Suzanne Collins writes it the way it should be. Realistic, and with the assumption that her teen readers are as demanding and intelligent as adult readers, which they are.

B004KSQN7C|4.0|I am a Britney fan, and none of her albums have failed to impress me. As far as Femme Fatale goes, the one word I would use to some it up is: catchy. There are so many great beats and killer hooks, everybody will be able to find at least one song that jives with them. There are a few standouts: \\"Till the world ends\\" obviously, \\"I Wanna Go\\", and \\"Inside Out\\" are all songs that I like. Brit said she wanted to stray sonically from her old material, and she pulled it off quite well. None of the songs are classic Britney, for example, one of my most favorite songs, \\"Trip To Your Heart\\", is a dream. Her soothing vocals and awesome production come together in an unworldy sound. Another great song is \\"Criminal\\". It uses a folk-style flute and a guitar, which is not used on any other song in the album. It's one of those songs you fall in love with instantly. Now these songs are great, and for the most part the whole album is fun and entertaining. But there are a few problems I've had with it. First off, Femme Fatale is a producer's paradise. every song uses heavy synths and copious amounts of auto-tune, which leads to kind of an unnatural sound. Also, her collaborations with Sabi and will.i.am leave a lot to be desired (Sabi MURDERS \\"drop dead beautiful\\" by the way). It was said that Britney did not write a single song and that she didn't have a big involvement in the album, and it shows. Some songs like \\"Drop Dead Beautiful\\", \\"Big Fat Bass\\", and \\"How I Roll\\" I think she sang just so she could get the big bucks. Generally speaking, it's a great dance album that should definitely be on the playlist for your next party, and in your car, everybody will be jamming out.
0374275637|5.0|We were lucky to be alive when 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' came out. Per Kahneman, that statement will probably unconsciously \\"tune\\" you to regard this review more seriously -- mortality makes people put more trust in authority.  Some books are Fast Foods, quickly chewed and forgotten. Some are gourmet and need slow ingestion and deeper focus. 'Thinking..' belongs to the later category. Whatever you do, make sure you have time to reflect after each key chapters. Just close the eyes and run through a decision you made -- among get married; bought first house; had stress level up after first kid; never watched a documentary in last 2 years despite having a lot in Netflix queue; have lesser faith on voters of Alaska, or Hawaii etc. -- and a lot of worthy self-introspection will ensue.  Metaphorically speaking, Kahneman's model breaks the 'logical brain' (not the hardware) into two components - fast (System I) and slow (System II). Think of System I being Dr. Watson - quickly arriving at decisions, not always accurate, neither insightful; while Sherlock Holmes (System II) is lazier and does not want to deal with every single question as producing an answer is taxing to the detective. System I is shallow, but extremely fast in processing because if follows some models and heuristics. When the models do not work as intended, go against -- say, probabilistic answer of whether a brief 3-line narrative about a person maps to a lawyer or artist -- it often creates 'fallacy'. When the models always produce a certain output from a given input set, the process is often an example of 'bias'.   e.g., A vaccine would save 90% impacted vs. it would kill 10 - may produce different emotional outcome even though both inputs are logically analogous. Similarly, while describing a person starting with positive keywords and ending with negative ones will have highly variable impact than starting with the negative keywords, even though in both sets we use the same keywords.   Most of these biases, heuristics and fallacies are fairly well known thanks to the slew of behavioral economics books published in last 4 years (Predictably Irrational; Nudge; Blink; Being Wrong; How We Decide; You are Not So Smart etc). What set Kahneman apart from the other books are (a) genesis thinking - he and co-researcher Amos Tversky are practically founding fathers of this science, and (b) an exceptionally lucid narrative expressed with humility that reaches out to the opposite side of opinion and try to honestly reconcile. e.g., Kahneman carefully calls out the difference between an expert's fast thinking that is honed with years of experience (a fire-fighter getting out of a house without knowing why; a doctor diagnosing a disease by looking at patient's skin tone etc) and the usual person's day-to-day decisions, especially inter-personal or financial ones. While doing so he also establishes a strong case against the \\"econs\\" that consider humans a perfectly rational agents while taking financial decisions.   The second half of the book is a mind candy as Kahneman delves deeper into 'Prospect Theory' and establishes a Profit-Loss-Risk Aversion-Risk Aggression quadrant. This is especially important segment for young people in today's tough economy.  Very rarely we do get a chance to transform ourselves. Most of the times the transformation happens through up-leveling our thinking and a mentor showing us a completely new plateau we were not even aware of. 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' does precisely that. Buy this book and gift to people you work with, you are in a relationship with or people who you think 'do not understand you' or vice versa.   By all means, if you are serious about introspection not reading this book would almost tantamount to a petty crime.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I have been using this app for about a week now on my Kindle Fire. I have to say, it is my favorite alarm app to date, this includes other alarm apps that I paid for as well. It has more features in it's free version than most of the other paid versions of alarm apps I have used. I really, really like the Volume Crescendo feature and the feature that allows you to use any mp3 sound file you have loaded in your device's storage. No more jumping out of my skin every morning to the rude \\"Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!\\" of my usual alarm clock.  The ad banner at the bottom of the screen that other users have mentioned hasn't been a nuisance in my experience. The Snooze and Disarm buttons are large enough on my Kindle Fire that I haven't once accidentally hit the ad button, even in a blurry-eyed still half-asleep state.  The one nuisance that I do have to mention (and the reason for 4 stars instead of a perfect 5) is that, when the alarm is armed, it constantly shows as a notification, so I always have an extra notification at the top of my screen. This is only a small nuisance though, and was perhaps intended by the devs to remind you that the alarm is set so that you can disarm it if you want to sleep in the next morning. But, if that were the case, I just wouldn't have an alarm scheduled for that day. So if that can be remedied in an update, I'd edit this review and give this app a perfect score of 5 stars.  All-in-all, you'd be hard pressed to find a better Alarm Clock app out there (paid or free), and definitely not a free version with as many features. Great app.
B001EC3JME|2.0|I had first bought this for my Maglite XL100 since that flashlight doesn't come with a holster and this was what was in \\"frequently bought together\\" section under the product picture(s) and price on here. It worked fine for about a month or so until the holster started to stretch out. I noticed the flashlight starting to slide out the bottom of the holster. I got into the habit of checking it throughout the day to slide the light back up into the holster. Eventually, I lost that flashlight. I bought an XL50 to replace it and wrapped the handle of that flashlight with a layer of grip tape. This worked OK until the holster stretched out further and this flashlight eventually dropped out and was lost as well. I can't recommend this holster for any flashlight that doesn't have a flared end on it but it should work fine for any traditional Maglite-style flashlight.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really like this case.<br /><br />I have been using this case from the day my Kindle Fire arrived. It fits perfectly and securely, adding very little bulk or weight to the Kindle Fire at all. This was my deciding factor in ordering this case as opposed to another, and I must say I'm very happy with my decision. I love the Kindle Fire's size and I didn't want a case that was going to add too much bulk or weight. This case fits the bill. (I also own a Kindle DX which I still use for reading; it's a bit lighter than the Fire and the battery life per charge and larger, non-backlit reading screen still make it a better device strictly for reading).<br /><br />I was trying very hard to find a negative aspect of this case to include in my review to be completely objective, but, honestly, I haven't found one yet.<br /><br />Here are the features I like best about this case:<br />* The non slip material the case is made of is great.<br />* The felt-lined interior surface of the (screen-facing) cover will protect your screen suitably.<br />* The built in stand for watching movies in full screen is a great feature which works perfectly without adding any unnecessary hardware or fold out protrusions.<br />* The \\"spine\\" of the cover is made of, what appears to be, a sturdy yet pliable material, allowing you to fold the cover completely back without worrying about wearing it out.<br />* The \\"clips\\" on all four corners of the main case body that secure the Kindle in it are tiny yet effective. They don't cover any portion of the screen and, once your Kindle is securely seated, you don't even notice them.<br />* The outer \\"frame\\" and backside of the case form a hard, protective shell for your Kindle to sit in.<br />* The elastic hand strap built into the backside of the case also doubles as a cover strap by pulling it over the outside edge of the case and flipping it over the cover. It keeps the cover from opening and flapping around.<br />* The entire build method and material used seems sturdy and should last quite awhile. I was skeptical at first about the way the front cover folds backward and then in half to create the stand that holds the Kindle for a viewing angle, but now that I've used it for over a week, I haven't found a single sign that this will become a wear point. I believe this case should last a good, long while.<br /><br />Overall, I can't find anything that could be improved. I'll update this post in a few months to report on the longevity of the case. But so far; flawless. A perfect case for your Kindle Fire.<br /><br />*** Update ***<br />The cover is still going strong, 1 and 1/2 months later of daily use. No problems at all. I kind of expected to see some signs of wearing in the fold-points and maybe some separation of the rubberized cover from the felt interior covers. But as of this writing, it looks as good as the day I bought it. No issues at all of the corner \\"keeper tabs\\" popping off the Kindle. It has, in all respects, become a part of the Kindle Fire itself. I couldn't imagine toting my Kindle around without this cover protecting it. I highly recommend this Kindle Fire cover. I can't find a single negative aspect of it. And I actually tried hard to find one. I hope this helps.<br /><br />*** 2nd Update ***<br />I've used this cover for almost a year now, and I am still very satisfied with it. It is showing very little wear, and I take my Kindle Fire with me almost everywhere I go. I had to have my Kindle Fire replaced because one of the speakers blew out and was crackling. I put the case on my replacement Kindle Fire (thank you Amazon for the painless replacement under warranty) and it still looks nearly new.<br /><br />There is a bit of wear on the bottom corners of the cover where the rubberized material has worn off just a bit revealing the hard black plastic underneath, but this is to be expected after a year of daily use and traveling.<br /><br />The elastic strap that acts as a cover holder is still strong and has not worn out or become loose.<br /><br />The corner clips that hold your Fire inside the cover are still intact and I had no problems at all removing my defective Fire from the case and inserting my replacement Fire.<br /><br />Overall, after a year of use, I still give this case/cover 5 stars. This is one of the best accessory products I have ever purchased.<br /><br />If you have a Kindle Fire, BUY THIS COVER/CASE, you will not be disappointed. MARWARE makes excellent products.
0812550706|5.0|First of all, I must remind all haters of this marvellous book that that Ender, Bean, and whoever other children in the book may be portrayed as \\"unrealistically\\" gifted  are NOT offensive. Please, people, can we not assume that these children are meant to be based on real autistic or other mentally advanced kids of the real world? This is a SCIENCE FICTION book. Therefore, all characters, technology, worlds, etc. are completely advanced and NOT intended to be realistic.  With that, I would first like to say that this is without a doubt the best novel I have ever read. It has the perfect balance of revelation, suspense, mystery, and thrilling battles. The whole idea of the Battle School and everything that lies within it is the highest level of creativity I have ever encountered. Each and every character represents a different personality - Bonzo Madrid is the complete and utter moron, the idiot of the book, the Spanish commander obsessed with pride, the anti-Ender young teen. Ender is the hero, the main character, the center of fame. Bean is the companion, the silent marvel, the super-intelligent six-year-old.  One thing that kind of caught me awkwardly was imagining six- to ten-year-olds with pre-puberty voices swearing and attacking each other with guns that freeze a hit target.  This book requires a very mature reader and is a great read for middle schoolers and high schoolers alike. Quite possibly the best Sci-Fi book of the century.
0545265355|5.0|I have read the entire trilogy, and loved it.  Like so many reviews that I read prior to this purchase, once I got into a book I couldn't put it down.  The author really pulls you along through the series.

0865478570|5.0|David Bellos' book on translation is a little modern masterpiece. By turns witty, funny, introspective, erudite and common, this book defies simple qualification. It's about translation, yes, but it's also about much more than that. How did language first come about? What is 'language' anyway? Why do different people speak different languages? And where does translation fit into this? And speaking of translation: what can it do, and what can't it do? Why don't we all just have little Hitchhiker's Guide fishies in our ears? Failing that, how about machines or computers - can't they just do the work of all those professionals we call 'translators'?<br /><br />Bellos artfully and sensibly navigates his way through these questions. This is a well-read and wide-ranging tome. The reader is transported from Plato to the Roman Empire to Louis XIV's France and to Ottoman Istanbul; from the Nuremberg Trials to the world of modern-day literature.<br /><br />And it's quite a revolutionary journey. In poppy, understated prose Bellos claims that language is not a vehicle for the transmission of one's own thoughts into another's mind. Rather, it's a social construct: a messy, confusing and wonderful way of saying \\"I am not you, but me.\\" And translation? Translation allows one group to share its experiences with another. They don't share abstract antiseptic ideals in a Platonic sense, but rather ill-defined 'meaning.' Cooing a baby, touching another's arm and saying 'The pen is in the box' are all analogous acts. They are at once social and abstract, at once thoughts and feelings and meanings. Translation allows us to make sense of this fizzy abstraction of socio-language. If, after all, something can be translated, then surely it has some meaning. For what is translation if not the transfer of meaning?<br /><br />Is That A Fish in Your Ear poignantly and unpresumptuously speaks to these issues. It's a wide-ranging little masterpiece. Particularly recommended are the last 15 or so pages of the book, Bellos' so-titled 'Afterbabble.' If you've no time for anything else, borrow the book from a friend and read the Afterbabble. You won't be missing mental food for weeks afterward.titled 'Afterbabble.' If you've no time for anything else, borrow the book from a friend and read the Afterbabble.

B00005JLK1|2.0|I bought this movie based on the cover art and even though I read the reviews here I was hoping that I would still end up liking the film.  Other reviewers have already dissected in details what they liked or not like about this film.  I have to say this movie turned out to be underwhelming in acting, story and special effect.    The nearest equivalent film that I can think that was opposite to this film was the Alien.  It had good acting, story was similar in that main characters are trapped in an confined area and the special effect actually made me jump out of the chair (really did) the first time I saw it.    This movie is okay as rental.  Unfortunately, I bought mine.

B005LJITS0|3.0|So most people critiquing this movie whine about the problems with the ultraviolet. Who cares, I am critiquing the movie. It's a cliche' superhero movie with all the testosterone BS but at least the love interest recognized him with his mask on which is more than we can say about Lois Lane! And if nothing else...Ryan is one awesome piece of eye candy!

B006GLQIVC|4.0|American Horror is a fantastic show. It's creative, intriguing, suspensful.. It's worth every cent to own these episodes. However if you don't pay complete attention-your apt to get lost.  The show is somewhat labrynth-esque in nature. It's a maze of murder, suicide, love triangles, hauntings and posessions... which are mostly fantastic.   Some bringing in and out of the character scheme doesn't flow smoothly. It could definitley be brought less choppy, more into a smooth transition. By blocking in and out the characters in such rapid succession, it confuses the story and leads to un neccessary extras to fill the time block in.   Pull out the fluffers and get back on track and this show will be given higher ratings.

Interactual is bad software in and of itself (it sends information about how you use it out to the content creator without notifying you) but it's also not compatible with Windows Vista or 7, and the DVDs are set up to block you from viewing them on a computer using any player but Interactual.  While it's installed, it will mess up the graphic display on your other players, and even if it's uninstalled, the DVD will halt playback or only play without sound.  There's no available fix for this and they don't even still make the Interactual player.

B000PGTPE6|5.0|Probably most people are more familiar with Springsteen's oeuvre than I am, since I just didn't pay much attention after his first couple of albums for no particularly good reason other than lost interest in popular music in general.  A friend ripped a copy of the Seeger sessions for us though and I was crazy about it.  The often seamless mixing of folk, country, jazz and dixieland genres within songs is to my ear absolutely delightful and Bruce's overly-gravelly voice (really he's not much of a singer to my way of thinking)works well in this sonic environment.  The performances in these shows keep the spirit of the original recording despite variations in arrangements and the video recording just adds to the interest and fun.   CAUTION: Springsteen does \\"drop the f-bomb\\", as they call it these days. on one of his songs, I think it was \\"Open All Night.\\"  I wish artists would avoid such crudities although it does to some extent fit the situation.  I can grudgingly let something like this slide as long as it doesn't characterize the performance, but it could be a dealbreaker for some.

The box could be stronger, but the board and pieces are really a good quality.  The pieces are translucent, and nearly sparkle as you play.  We found the game worked best with three players...more was too crowded to allow anyone to actually play out completely. No dice to roll or cards to suffle, and a bit like tetrus in it's looks.  Good stuff. We played with a 7,10,17 year olds and us parents, nearly 50.  Everyone had fun.

0553381695|3.0|Like a lot of people, I bought the 4 book set after watching A Game of Thrones on HBO.  The first book was magnificently written, and Martin is as great a storyteller as anyone.  His wit and sarcasm are brilliant, and there are so many wise and witty quotes attributed to his characters that it is impressive indeed to think that they all came from the mind of one man.  And the intricacies of all the sub-plots are amazingly well thought-out.  That being said, A Clash of Kings seems to be devoted entirely to setting people and events in motion for the next book.  A common theme among Martin's negative or neutral reviews is that at times he seems to be telling a story for the sake of telling a story; and has no idea where the story is heading.  I have only 150 pages or so to go in ACOK, and not a whole lot has happened in the first 800 pages.  The most perplexing surprise is that, despite the name of the book, none of the chapters are written from the POV of any of the 4 kings - the most conspicuous absence is Robb Stark's. Well, okay - there are a few mentions of Joffrey's being in need of a cosmic bitch-slap, but that's about it.  Also, Martin has made the jump from historical fiction to fantasy in this book (well, technically at the end of AGOT), but that's okay - after all, the series is called A Song of Ice and Fire, so we know that dragons and trouble north of The Wall will come into play, but . . . when?  Also, a minor annoyance is Martin's obsession with detailed descriptions of meals and wardrobes.  I guess this can be chalked up to historical research and an attempt at accuracy, though.  But - enough already.  I'm giving this book (and the series so far) 3 stars, because I loved AGOT, and I'm on the fence about how I feel at this point in the series.  I'm wondering, will the book end with a whimper like the rest of the book, or will he pull a Stephen King and wrap it all up in a bow in the last 25 pages; whether it makes sense or not?  We shall see.  In the meantime, I still have 3 books to go before I hit the \\"waiting period,\\" if I make it that far . . . .
0525423656|5.0|A great 2nd book in the Matched series. I love this world Ally Condie has created! I feel like I'm there in the book with Cassia and Ky. I care about these characters AND I love the plot. I want to know what's going to happen, and I want to read to find out if my character friends are alright in the end.<br /><br />I enjoyed the two points of view this time. The book switched between first person POV from Cassia and Ky. Even with the chapters being headed with the character's name for the POV I still got a little confused when I was rushing through during exciting parts. Not a big deal though. I liked getting to know Ky better by getting into his head. I wonder if Ally will add Xander's POV in the 3rd book.<br /><br />The setting was mysteriously beautiful. I have visited some of the southern Utah terrain that inspired the setting. The characters go on a difficult journey during this book. They all seemed relatively safe and sound in their town during the first book, but Crossed sends them to unknown places and situations which made for a new level of excitement. I can tell the third book will be an exciting finale.<br /><br />Ok, who's Team Ky and who's Team Xander? I have to say I'm both. I'm Team Ky because I think he's awesome and strong and a natural leader and wise. I'm Team Xander because he's smart and mysterious and fun and caring. Tough choice!<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful read! I loved it!<br /><br />Happy Reading!

B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin  \\"III\\"  #1  (1970)  #30 R&B.  On their 3rd album, Led Zeppelin turned the volume down a tad.  This brings to mind a great folk-rock record of the mid 60's by the Incredible String Band.  Although the album starts off with the thundering \\"Immigrant Song\\" #16, nothing else was as brutal on this album.  \\"Friends\\", has some fine Jimmy Page pickin' and some good orchestration.  \\"Celebration Day\\", is a good little rocker, fun times.  The blues of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", a classic track in the Zep library.  \\"Out On The Tiles\\", is our Zeppelin, \\"Gallows Pole\\", folk tune nice mandolin by Jones, Page and Plant at there best.  \\"Tangerine\\", is a gentle acoustic piece, played a lot in the late 70's and early 80's on rock radio, hardly ever heard nowadays.  The classic \\"That's The Way\\", good groover.  \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\", is just that a good acoustic stomper.  The album closes with the great slide guitar workout of Jimmy Page, on \\"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\\".  Led Zeppelin would release \\"The Sticks\\", album in 1971.  The band would keep growing.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I purchased this Forerunner with Amazon's lightning deal (Nov 2011) and I was suspecting something was up reading the number of reviews where people had trouble with this watch and given that it was put on sale so much during Thanksgiving. But the 5 star reviews were very positive and they gave work-arounds to all the problems mentioned. And this watch was much cheaper with a lot of functionality than the newer versions with better user interface. So I thought, why not give it a try. I received the watch yesterday and it does not work. I have returned it within 24 hours of receiving it. I followed all the instructions on installing the ANT device software before connecting the USB stick. I install the USB stick and it can't find the ANT device software. Windows 7 starts finding the ANT device software itself. Once installed, I try to connect to the device (which has been fully charged). It cannot find the device at all. Tried 4 different USB ports. Device could not be found. I start configuring the watch. I select English as language and quickly tap the bezzle per instructions to select. The watch beeps but nothing happens. I cannot select a language. If I can't even program the watch itself and can't download setting from myGarmin, then this thing is absolutely useless. I cannot get out of the language setting mode. Contacted Amazon and returned the watch. I thought I would be able to work around all the usability issues, but no.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin \\"II\\",  #1  and #32 R&B.  This follow up to their classic debut, is just as good, but doesn't get as many spins as there first.  Everybody knows \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", #4, i'm kind of burnt out on this tune, but overall it's still a strong hard rocker.  \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\", is a gentle folk rocker that gets a kick in the pants by a Page guitar solo later in the song, good stuff.  The funky and perverse \\"Lemon Song\\", the lovely  \\"Thank You\\", good organ by Jones.  The smoldering \\"Heartbreaker\\", one of Page's classic riffs, goes straight into \\"Living Loving Maid(She's Just A Woman)\\", #65, a radio staple.  \\"Ramble On\\", great tune, everyone does great on this one.  Then you get the blues riff rocker instrumental \\"Moby Dick\\" and it closes with the blues rock of \\"Bring It On Home\\", love the harmonica work of Robert Plant.  They would switch gears for their 3rd album in late 1970.

B005H0IW6W|5.0|From the first time I saw him perform \\"Everything\\" on one of the morning shows, I have been hooked. I, my husband, my three year old and even my one year old love Michael.  Our three year old son even knows all of the words to \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\"!  He is simply fabulous and now to have him singing Christmas music is even more fabulous!  Don't let your Christmas collection be without Mr. Buble!

B004SJ3AXI|2.0|Not as good as RIO. Set up for you to fail. I've tried rebooting and I stol can't get it to stop trying to down load.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|These headphones/mic combo is the best on the market for the price. Many variable sound settings to be adjusted to your liking which is magnificent when annoying chatters start up, or if your on a momentum swing you can turn that expander knob off, blast them fully with the bass fully blasting as well and you will be hearing gunshots in your sleep, TRUST ME.   No real fault with these besides the fact that if handled roughly from alot of the younger gamers out there, these will BREAK under pressure. But anyone who cares for what they purchase will take care of them and they WILL LAST for a very long time. IF you dont put oil in your car for over 100,000 miles ten to one your are going to purchase a new car not far after, same with these. Everyday use accompanied with everyday car after use will have these bad boys or girls dependind, lasting for a very very long time.  DEFF. worth the money since there are not alot, companies or brands, that even make a full headphone set with mic included at this price.  It is a little complicated to SET UP, and ilL BE THE FIRST TO STRESS THIS ONE LITTLE FACT THAT HAD ME GOING CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!  YOU WILL NEED THE RCA CABLES FROM BACK IN THE EARLY 2000'S LOL.... YOU CANNOT GET THESE TO WORK W/O THE RCA CABLES, SO I SUGGEST BUYING THE RCA CABLES , OR KNOW WHERE THEY ARE BEFORE PURCHASING.   i couldnt use mine for over a week since no walmart or best buy supplied them in my area so giving future buyers the heads up to how they HAVE TO BE SETUP!!!!!!

B000TNF7NS|5.0|I just want to say this album is suberb rock n roll heavy metal whatever you want to call it. If you love guitar this is a must or if you love to rock its a must. Every song is great not a bad song on this album.
1451627289|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this book.  11/22/63 was my 7th birthday so I defintely remember the Kennedy assasination so have looked forward to the release of this book.  My daughter bought it for my birthday and I spent Thanksgiving weekend reading it. As far as I'm concerned there wasn't a dull moment.  Loved all the references to other King books. Those always make me smile, like I've met up with an old friend.  Long live the King, may he keep up the good work for a long time.

B00026ZG10|3.0|If the opening scene is not a dead give away (Things blowing up and suddenly he is being chased by bad guys on ski's) this is a spy movie although it dose go more into the \\"Action\\" of the film.    This is your typical spy movie and your typical Arnold Scwarzenegger film, The rest of the cast makes this film fun (Tom Arnold and his typical humor).  Over all this is a fun film but it is a typical movie in several ways this film is enjoyable to watch and it is fun but be warned it is typical.

B0064Y5U24|4.0|Unlike most albums every song on this album is worth listening to. Nickelback has always produced albums that were worth buying just for that reason alone. Not every one of these songs will make it too my iphone but most will. If you like Nickelback you'll like this album. As far as people saying they sold out, well that's just rubbish.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|My kids 7 & 9 were glued to this even though there are no words spoken for the duration of the movie (about 28 minutes). They loved the constant action from start to finish. However, when it reached the end my son looked at me with tears in his eyes \\"Mommy, that's not how movies are supposed to end.\\" Uh-oh. Hey, I didn't know it wasn't a happy ending. It ended up initiating a conversation about what bittersweet is and how it's the happy parts you need to remember when something sad occurs. Yeah, that didn't really help.  Did the kids like it? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes. Just be prepared to know that (spoiler here....) the snowman doesn't make it past the day he is made and the fun and adventurous night - in the morning he is melted.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I've used a few transmitters before, & they are all quite weak in audio & RF. This unit, as I've read elsewhere, is strong enough to eliminate outside interference. I planned to hook up my Sansa Clip+ with included cord, but no need--I used both a thumb drive & a microSD card, & they play very well. I just don't understand how they can sell the best transmitter I've tried,along with a built-in bonus mp3 player,plus a remote control, for less than $50..?
0307891372|3.0|Guide is lacking in some areas, and I'm already feeling like some of the pages want to come off of the binding.  You will probably also finding yourself having to check out several different pages for the exact info you are wanting to get. I think they concentrated too hard to give you specifics about things that don't really matter, and don't cover more relevant material. This guide is a decent effort I give it a \\"C\\". At this price and considering its all thats available I would say it is a fair deal.
1466208686|5.0|I have been preparing for Software Engineering interviews, and have tried a few other books before I came across \\"Cracking the Coding Interview\\" and \\"The Google Resume\\". Gayle's books really do stand out due to their layout, design, teaching style, and the \\"empathetic\\" voice...they speak to the student directly.   Gayle's empathetic voice helps in tackling some of the \\"dull\\" topics like bit manipulation. She lays out the important facts and key tips in order so you don't get intimidated by the topic, and then offers important preparation problems for extra practice.  I would HIGHLY recommend this book.

It was so incredible that I cannot put it into words! Could it become better than that? Yes! Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children COMPLETE came out a couple of years later, filling in any \\"holes\\" that the previous movie could have had.<br /><br />This story, is as the title says, \\"complete\\" in many ways: extra scenes that helps the story understanding and development, deep story-line added and so on.<br /><br />Now it's time for Advent Children to embrace the HD world. The dvd is a BluRay one with an incredible image and sound! You won't regret getting it! Ever!

0439023513|3.0|I read through this trilogy in a matter of 4 days, with Mockingjay taking me the longest to get through. I was hooked with Hunger Games and couldn't put it down. It was fast paced with a strong heroin that would do anything to save her family, including sacraficing herself. My heart went out to Katniss as she took her sisters place and was thrown into a world where humanity was a joke and she had to live with killing others for survival. I felt bad for her in Catching Fire when it seemed as though things may turn around for her, yet she was distracted and didn't see what lied ahead as she was thrown back into the games. I believe she started to fall for Peeta as he made it clear to her he would give up anything, including his life to keep her alive. However, in Mockingjay I was very disapointed that the strong heroin I came to love became so broken, weak and self absorbed. She ultimately let the Capitol use her as a puppet. Most of the book centered around her being the spokes person for the revolution and filming propos in order to rally the rebelions. This was not what I expected. I understand Collins point that many wars are created and driven by what we see instead of us actually living the truth; however, I would have expected Katniss to tell them to shove their cameras where the sun doesn't shine and go into the battle head on for the suffereing that was caused to the people she loved.   My heart wretched when Peeta was captured and only to be rescued after he was hijacked. The character with the soft heart that I came to love was turned into a weakened tormented individual who wouldn't tell the difference between memories that were real and not real. I understand that in real life war situations most people who are tortured come back changed and can never return to their former selves because of the suffering they endured and the horror they witnessed but I was hoping that Katniss would fight for him and make him remember why he loved her for so long. Insteadshe stood by and did nothing until Haymitch pointed out that if the roles were reveresed her would never leave her that way. The action finally comes when they are sent on a mission to film props that make the sharp shooters look as if they are in the line of battle when they are not. Not until most of her crew is killed does she decide that her final mission will be to kill President Snow. Although in this part the action was fast paced it seemed rushed. So much of the book had been dedicated to her doing nothing but being the mouth piece for the revolution that I assume it didn't gie much time to develope the war itself.   I was disapointed with the ending. It left me sad and depressed. I realize that in real life many people may not overcome the horrors or injustifications that war brings with loss but I was hoping that there would be a more hopeful approach to the ending. This book had all the elements to go out with a fire but instead to me it went out with a flicker.   Some of the characters I grew to love such as Finick were killed off and others I enjoyed such as Johnana were left undeveloped. I felt as though Katniss spent most of the book in depression feeling sorry for herself instead of taking her future into her own hands. In the end I did not understand the reasoning behing Prim's death. It arroused irritation in me since the entire series began with Katniss taking Prim's place in the games, yet ultimately she died anyway. I finally thought I was seeing some of the strong characteristics of the old herion I loved when instead of shooting President Snow, Katniss turned her arrow on Coin. I couldn't have been more wrong because instead of justifying her actions and speaking out against what had been done she goes into depression and contimplates suicide. I know Collins wanted to show that not everyone recovers and wanted to give a real life perspective but this left me sad and depressed in itself. It could be because I get to involved with the characters I read about. Ultimatly instead of being able to live what happed to Gale or Peeta during this time we are merely told what happened to them while Katniss was in her state of morphling addiction.   Lastly I longed for the point in the book that she would finally realize her love for Peeta and make the choice between the two boys that loved her that she had strung along. But alas another disappointment. Gale, whom she thought would stand beside her no matter what, her life long friend, takes a job else where as they have grown apart during all the grief they shared. I was hooked on Peeta from the start and thought that he was always the person that would sacrafice anything for her but I wanted her to realize it and fight for him. It seems as though she instead settled for him because he was all that was left that reminded her of her old life. This seems unfair to me to do to a character that was willing to give up everything to keep her alive. At least knowing they were to be together I had hoped Collins would have developed that aspect a little more and show him as he returned to his previous self. This did not happen. In the end we see him still struggling with the fact of what is real and not real, her still battling the fact that she still cares for Gayle as she still feels as though she is alone in her depression. In the final chapter we see that Katniss and Peeta have children which she seems to state was a little forced. Although beautifully written when Katniss speaks of her children you can still feel her sorrow and grief.   For a series that was so addicting that I read the first two books in a matter of a few days this would not have been my choice for the ending. Perhaps this was Collins entire point though that not all things end with happy endings. It causes the reader to want more, to justify the wrongs and restore everything to what was happy and what we as the reader can live with. I guess she is smart in the tactic that it will get you talking, itwill upset you and it will keep the book on your mind. I wouldn't not recommend the first two books for the lack of what I felt for this one but I wish this book could have taken the fire the first two had created in me and kept it a blaze intstead of putting it out and leaving me with smoke.

B005NPLXJ4|5.0|After reading so many negative reviews of this brilliant album I just had to say something that speaks to its creativity and brilliance. What is wrong with us, America? We hate commercial (canned) rock and American Idol crap designed for various markets and when we get a REALLY cutting edge work of art we reject it? First, play Iced Honey, an absolutely amazing track that kicks butt and is as good as Sweet Jane (from Lou Reed's Velvet Underground) or, like, Holier Than Thou from Metallica's black album. Most all reviews skip the fact that these songs were solicited from Lou by an internationally renowned director to complement the themes of, and provide musical accompaniment to, a new version/fusion of two German plays from around 1900 about a small-town girl (listen to Brandenburg Gate) who becomes a prostitute and reflects on the decadence/angst/anxiety that could be found in Berlin and in her own soul. It is a profound, sonorous exploration of this subterranean life. Lou is brilliant exploring this underbelly, these depths, of unspoken things in society and our souls. AND LOU AND METALLICA PERFECTLY WED THEME WITH SOUND!!! The music perfectly complements the disturbing themes that are explored. Does nobody remember their own youth (at the least!) and the angst and/or anxiety they felt toward being? This is all about that but in the context of an exploration that is both life unplugged and that spews contempt on our absurd petit-bourgeois way of living. Please give these tremendous songs a chance. Of course we all so drink our own Kool-Aid can we even appreciate the irony of Cheat On Me? Do we have it all figured out or can we appreciate the sexual confusion of Mistress Dread? Junior Dad, a tremendous song and profound in its reflection on father/son relations, expectations, realizations. And as with much Lou Reed, you have this underlying soundscape out of which emerges his grim, unplugged, fact-facing, despairing voice, it's moving. Hetfield's backing vocals areoutstanding and Metallica is so on their game. When I read all these negative reviews I wondered if we were even listening to the same record. Give this a chance, there's not much like it made any longer.

B005C7MVC6|4.0|Bon Iver is the newest record by singer-songwriter Justin Vernon. It was released June 21st here in the United States and slightly earlier worldwide. It has received rave reviews for the most part and has gotten an 86 out of 100 cumulative score on Metacritic.com. The 10-song album was written and produced by Vernon himself and is the culmination of a long period of success since 2007 in the wake of the mononucleosic tear jerker and critical knockout, For Emma Forever Ago.    In 2006, Justin Vernon retreated to his father's cabin in northwestern Wisconsin while sick with mono and disillusioned by the breakup of his band. There, armed with primitive recording gear, he began recording songs as they came to him. He had not intended to record an entire record but luckily for us he did because the result was one of the most achingly beautiful pieces of art in years.  In 2007, the world got its first helping of Justin Vernon's solo project, Bon Iver, with the self released album For Emma Forever Ago. Playing with themes of isolation and depression, the album gave us an intimate, if not fleeting, glimpse into the gloomy mind of the artist and flew in the face of big record labels with its huge success despite low budget production. Well, this raised a few eyebrows and opened a few pocket books and, as a result, Bon Iver was signed to the hugely popular indie labels Jagjaguwar and 4AD. With a new budget, it was time for a follow-up.    It came in the form of the eponymous Bon Iver. Bon Iver kicks off with \\"Perth,\\" a track that plays like a summary of every idea introduced in Emma. A woozy guitar riff gives way to Vernon's instantly recognizable falsetto, setting any sophomore slump notions to rest and perfectly setting the tone for the rest of the record.   Tracks like the swooning \\"Towers\\" lay to rest any preconceived notions of being self-referential by introducing church cadences and chirping synths previously unheard in Vernon's compositions. This time around, Vernon seems focused, as if he has awoken from his dreamy delirium ready to show us he's more than just a fluke.    With all its overarching beauty and confidence, Bon Iver is not without its problems. While the record retains much of its predecessor's moodiness and tone in terms of lyrics and subject matter, it does not retain its sense of intimacy. Gone are the cheap buzzing microphones and humming desktop computers that gave the first full-length album its timeless feel. This is forgivable though. If artists didn't grow and change, we would have missed out on hundreds of amazing albums (e.g. Bob Dylan going electric or Radiohead's Kid A).    Bon Iver is a powerful and convincing sophomore effort that is worthy of your time. It is a record that rewards patience and demands attention. Although it doesn't retain all of the same qualities that we fell in love with in certain other previous efforts, it does introduce enough new ideas to more than make up for its omissions.
B004M3H17Q|3.0|I immediately took issue with the album for the simple fact that the first couple of minutes of a few songs sounded very similar in terms of vocal style with a musician that I do happen to really like, Justin Vernon from Bon Iver fame. My husband and I unfairly dismissed it right away but my husband came back to it a week or two later and did some research on Blake and his previous releases and had somewhat of a change of heart. I, being the stubborn person I can be sometimes, had my mind made up about it. However, I eventually came around somewhat while listening to it on my MP3 player on my phone in the car.  The song that made me perk up and pay close attention was \\"I Never Learnt To Share.\\" The crazy, frantic, and indescribably hypnotic nature of the beat and the funky-futuristic breakdown towards the end of the song really grabbed me in a way that I wasn't expecting. However, I still wasn't completely in love with the vocals as they sounded like a blatant rip-off of another vocalist I am a fan of, Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons.  But aside from this small disappointment, I decided to actually give the album a fighting chance and listen to it in its entirety. The album gets off to a nice and interesting start with \\"Unluck,\\" a simple, melodic, piano-driven song with fairly simple vocals. There is the occasional break in the monotony with a strange, record-scratching effect interrupting every five seconds or so. And then the beat in the background comes more into the forefront, building and building, and it jumps back to the original pattern at the beginning and more effective, Auto-Tuned vocals appear.   The fourth and fifth tracks (\\"Lindisfarne I\\" and \\"Lindisfarne II\\") basically sounds like Blake was shamelessly copying tracks that he probably listened to repeatedly from Bon Iver's For Emma Forever Ago release. The only noticeable difference was that Blake used even more voice-effecting computer techniques for his vocals, to which I would say the popular quote \\"Too much of a good thing can sometimes be bad.\\"  One of the few all-around great tracks on the record is the Feist cover \\"Limit To Your Love.\\" The cover is actually done very well and one of the few instances where Blake's delicate, vocals seem to work to his advantage. It could easily compete with the original version and that is saying a lot because I am a huge fan of Feist. And again, Blake's brilliant producer skills come into play and lend a special touch to the original version. I never thought a hip-hop beat could make this Feist classic sound even better.  I think that Blake's self-titled debut is at least worth a listen for his talent as a producer alone. He, however, has a long way to go as far as learning to find his own distinctive style as a vocalist and as a songwriter. Maybe this is just the case of a brilliant producer who wants to do too much. Maybe he would be better off producing for artists who have that extra something that makes them \\"them\\". Or maybe Blake just needs a little more time to come into his own.

0142000655|5.0|East of Eden is going to be a book that lasts for centuries. It's one of the most modern, classic novels. John Steinbeck pains my heart with his characters, but I think that's his intention; there's a sprinkling of all his characters inside all of us, and I think that's the beauty of his writing. There are few books I've read where the character is the one talking, not the author. I love his writing, his deep insights, and a true look inside human nature and inside the human heart.

B003NFM3JK|5.0|First off I must say that I am generally NOT a Jim Carrey fan.  I find his humor to be crass and most of his movies are not funny to me except for a few.  However, I find this to be an excellent movie and Jim Carrey's flexibility in acting are great in this movie.  He plays a wide variety of characters, from Ebenezer Scrooge to the Ghost of Christmas Past, and the Ghost of Christmas Present, and a few more.  I was impressed with his voice overs.  The animation is outstanding and I enjoy the \\"special effects\\" which compliment this classic story by Charles Dickens.  I remember when it first came out in theatres.  I decided not to see it because as I have stated, I am generally not a Jim Carrey fan.  I saw it on DVD last Christmas season and was quite pleasantly suprized.<br />For those of you who are not a Jim Carrey fan, I must say that you should see this movie if you chose not to watch any of his other movies.  This one is NOT a disappointment or insulting in anyway.  I really enjoyed it and will watch it during the Christmas season for years to come.  Highly Recommended!
B005KJZDXK|1.0|I bought the LP to collect the red vinyl, and that was fine.  I also got a code for a digital download version, which was great because I'm not planning to play the LP.<br />But the singing.... vapid and insipid. Zoey is cute but her singing is so lacking... it's sounds like someone singing in her sleep.  It's like the sound you get when you blow in a ditzy blondes ear and hear it rushing out the other ear.
B000056HE9|4.0|What a great holiday classic movie this is.  In the movie are the great Hollywood actors and actresses.  These are Cary Grant, David Niven and the beautiful Loretta Young.  I won't go into the details of the plot since there are many who have before me.

B005UBNKZG|5.0|I purchased this processor to build a new workstation.  I primarily run virtual workstations on my work machine and I really wanted to give this new 8 core processor a try.  Boy, am I impressed!  This thing just crushes any workload I can throw at it.  I paired it up with a Gigabyte 990FXA motherboard and it works like a dream!  16 gb of ram installed.  I run linux as my base operating system and am running VMware Workstation with ease.  I have had 6 virtual windows machines running inside my box with absolutely no hesitation on this workstation.  Even running folding@home in the background this thing just never slows down.  If you are looking for a processor than can handle heavy workloads, this is the chip for you.  I'm planning on buying two more setups identical to the one I have after the first of the year.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I like these books.  They are easy to read, easy to understand.  They are a bit predictable but I don't expect less when reading young adult books.  I have to say that the love triangle somewhat resembled Twilight's love triangle.  Some parts seemed to be unoriginal but all in all I really liked them.  I am looking forward to the movies to see if there is depth added that I found lacking in the books.
B001E45XT4|3.0|The product itself was great when it arrived. I shipped these to my husband in Afghanistan so we could Skype. He said it was comfortable enough for him to wear it for long periods of time. Unfortunately, after 2 months, the microphone no longer works. It was great while it lasted. Good thing we didn't pay full price for it..

Also, when I got sick, I realized other people would write about me if I died, and they wouldn't know anything.  They'd get it all wrong.  So I wanted to make sure someone heard what I had to say.\\" - Steve Jobs reason for having Walter Isaacson write his biography<br /><br />I did not intend to read this book.<br /><br />I did not know Steve Jobs, but I know several people who did, including a few who worked with him.  Most described the experience of working with him as 1) priceless, and 2) one that no amount of money could get them to repeat.  I have heard many stories of his brilliance and brutality.  I, have read several books about Apple (the early years and after Jobs returned), and watched an excellent documentary on Pixar.  And I don't usually read biographies.<br /><br />The fact that I did read the book is testimony to the genius of Steve Jobs (and Jeff Bezos) and the talent of Walter Isaacson.  I was in a hotel room one evening having trouble falling asleep, and downloaded the first few chapters of the Kindle edition (for free) to my iPad.  No one has approached Jobs' genius for creating an immediate, exhilarating user experience in the digital age, and it's hard to imagine he could have chosen a better biographer than Isaacson.  Within fifteen minutes, I was hooked.<br /><br />Isaacson clearly did his research, and the fact that Jobs gave him complete access to his life, and encouraged friends and foes (in Jobs life, many people are both) to speak honestly about their relationships and experiences with Jobs gave him the detail he needed.  But his talent allows him to tell a richly textured, deeply affecting story from cover-to-cover (undoubtedly, an antiquated expression for a digital book).<br />As a father of an adopted son, I was especially moved by the description of an incident when Jobs, at six or seven years old, told a neighborhood girl he was adopted, to which she responded, \\"So does that mean your real parents didn't want you?\\"<br /><br />\\"I remember running into the house, crying.  And my parents said, `No, you have to understand.'  They were very serious and looked me straight in the eye.  They said, `We specifically picked you out.'  Both of my parents said that and repeated it slowly for me.  And they put an emphasis on every word in that sentence.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the book, Isaacson reports similar details that give the reader keen insights into the events that shaped Jobs, without injecting amateur psychological suppositions.  The result is great reporting delivered in a wonderful narrative.  As I read the book, I realized that my image of Jobs, while accurate, was a caricature.  By the end of the book, I had a fully formed picture of a brilliant, passionate, and deeply flawed human being.<br /><br />Steve Jobs never read any part of the biography.  He gave Walter Isaacson complete control of the story, although, after seeing the initial design for the book cover, he threatened to kill the project, until he received complete creative control of the cover design.  Initially, I was amazed that someone who had guarded his privacy so closely would relinquish control of his life story.  But then I realized that he simply followed the process he had used in business.  Jobs did not personally create technology, films, commercials, etc.  But he carefully selected incredibly talented people, provided them the resources to create \\"insanely great\\" products, and exerted absolute control over product packaging.  Steve Jobs, the book, is not insanely great, but is an informative, interesting, and worthy result of his and Walter Isaacson's creative process.e responded, \\"So does that mean your real parents didn't want you?\\"   \\"I remember running into the house, crying.

086571701X|3.0|I got the ipmressions from the other reviews and from the title that this was going to be a step-by-step guide to set up my system. I found that it had lots of useful information, but the info was generic. For example, you will not find out how to make a bell siphon, only that you could use one for one of the set up options.

B00650SSWG|5.0|I know a lot of people have compared this to No Strings Attached. On the surface, it looks that way. However, this movie was sooooooo much better than that. There are so many laugh out loud moments, the script is great and includes a lot of great jokes and one-liners. Justin and Mila have great chemistry and while I wish Justin would come out with a new album, there's no denying he's a great actor... especially in this movie. This is probably my favorite role that I've seen him play. This movie has definitely become a top favorite of mine!

1451627289|5.0|I'm one of King's \\"constant readers\\". Having come of age just as King was first topping the best seller charts, I've read most of what he has written. And while I'm still sure to buy and read his latest, I'm not as sure to love it as I once was. I loved 11/22/63.  For me, King's books are never about the horror, the gore, or the supernatural. Sure, I willingly suspend disbelief to enjoy them; but that isn't WHY I enjoy them. The reason I love King's books are two-fold: He writes some of the most loveable and fully fleshed out characters of any author, and he is a pure story teller. There is not a lot of literary pretense, just a lot of manic page turning.  11/22/63 is no exception. For a few days I hated all aspects of my life that didn't permit me time to read. I didn't want to work, sleep, or interact with my family. I just wanted to follow the exploits of Jake Epping in the mid-twentieth century. And when I finished, I didn't know how to feel. I was exhilarated to have just read such a wonderful book; but I mourned the fact that it was over.  The thing I was most pleased about was that with 11/22/63 King didn't fall into a trap that he often lands in. In my opinion, for the last 20 years or so King has had difficulty ending his books. The buildup is usually wonderful, the characters fully alive in my imagination, and then he realizes that somehow the story must end. Sooooo, the plants come alive, or giant insects invade the story, or something else just as implausible and unsatisfying. Not so in 11/22/63. The conclusion is just as enjoyable as the rest of the book. The only letdown is that it's time to put the book on the shelf, and try to find something else to read.  For anyone who has been mildly disappointed by the books of middle aged King, and who long for his vintage books: read 11/22/63. It is pure pleasure!
B001AQT0OU|5.0|and I'll tell you why all Kubrick films except 2001 and maybe Eyes there is image on the top and bottom where the stupid black bars are for your modern day lcd/led/3D tv sets I watched these movies when they were on vhs when they were in 4x3 and in a nut shell he filled that lens in a box frame not a rectangle or a big rectangle but a square there are important images on top and bottom to fill the ol movie screens and ol tube tv sets. It's bull every movie before 2000 was mostly filmed without bars now its understandable you make a movie in a circle frame or any shape technology is that deranged. Even the new Godfathers 1/2 are wrong. Again missing imagery cropped from top and bottom because of tv technology which are all RECTANGLE I don't care what Lord Bullington/Leon says. Look at all the Kubrick 4x3 and compare to the now black framed and you'll see there is top/bottom detail missing. But I have to live with Blue Ray because it's better than all the past 1999 versions and prior since Laser disc quality/old technology couldn't be helped. Still I miss the image that was once there and now gone and to me it is significant like taking a expensive square work of art and cut the top and bottom to make it a rectangle it's insane.<br />your friend, Stanley Kubrick<br />I REPEAT THIS REVIEW HAS MERIT BUT LEON IS RIGHT I COMPARED THE 4X3 VIDEO AND THE BLUE RAY DVD AND THERE IS NOTHING MISSING SO MY REVIEW WAS WRONG BUT SOME OF THE OTHERS LIKE THE SHINING YES IT'S CROPPED. THE BLUE RAY IS THE DEFINITIVE BEEN CLEANED UP AND DONE WITH 2011 TECHNOLOGY WHY DON'T THEY PUT OUT A REGULAR ONE DOES EVERYONE HAVE BLUE RAY?
B0031SCV46|4.0|I'm sure this was once in a million, but one of the keys on mine is not flush with the others, like its spring is slightly stretched out...  Not enough a problem to send it back, but bummed its not perfect.  I'll probably fix it myself later, but...  I would still recommend the keyboard, but if anyone at M-Audio reads this, turn the lights on over there, it's easy to see this problem.  For those wishing to reprogram the midi patches, they only offer \\"Direct-Link\\" which will send down sets for a few apps.  There used to be a great GUI based programmer (Enigma) but it doesn't work with this unit, I found that most irritating (if anyone knows a third-party solution, please post a link).  Also you only get one free tech support call, after that it requires payment.
B000HF6XV8|4.0|Interesting movie and well acted, I liked most scenes except  for the scene where the kids are calling the spirits,that   scene could have been deleted. Movie had very nice sceneries  as well.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|This is a lovely, quality cover for the Kindle Fire. The look and feel is expensive. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five is there is no way to convert to a stand. After I received my Fire, I realized I would like to be able to stand it up. but I'm happy with this cover, so I'll continue to try to figure out a way to prop it up, and will update if I succeed. But it looks good!!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|was WAY worth it =) I like the way the boxset came instead of having a bunch of cases it is compact with all disks in one box =)
0061974307|3.0|The physical quality of the used book was NOT represented appropriately.  It was VERY dog eared and very used.  I would never have sold it to someone else and probably would not have given it to a friend.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Great quality and very comfortable!! The sound in this thing is amazing. Truly a great price I paid and truly a great item! :D
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I love the Breaking Dawn Part I OST! It has so amazing music that fits perfectly the mood of the film! I think the movie was the best of the series until now and the OST is also very impressive. My personal favourites are \\"From now on\\" and \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth (Wedding Edition)\\". Thanks a lot
B001P9KR8U|1.0|The movie is fantastic but don't waste any $ on this DVD release. It looks like one of those put out quickly to cash in on the Oscar buzz. There are zero extras on this. That's right--no commentary tracks, no deleted scenes, no making of's, etc.<br /><br />Come on! There is a huge goldmine of stuff they could have done as to how this movie even got made, a look at the actors who we know little of and a look at Mumbai itself.<br /><br />Shameful release really that shows almost no understanding of the DVD market.
1400069181|4.0|The book was not extremely well-written, not because of grammar or any problems of that sort, but because stories jumped quickly from one to the other. I think, honestly, it was a result of the author wanting to share a lot of examples of how a business or objective pursued for a greater cause can really make a difference. And I loved reading about all the different companies (large and small) that are truly making a difference in the world, even with small steps.   Blake shares the story of TOMS shoes and how through trials, he and his team have made a successful business than is for-profit, which guarantees that they can continue to do \\"shoe drops\\" (when they distribute the shoes to the children in need) on a regular basis and without waiting for the next order. His story is inspirational, one of overcoming obstacles and thriving in a world that says looking out for \\"number one\\" is most important. I really enjoyed reading more about the TOMS story and some of the people who have helped TOMS become the great organization it is today.   Some of the other organization he focuses on in the book are chartity:water, FEED projects, and method, among others. Reading more about these companies helps me to see the need for business men and women to step outside of the box and work for something bigger than themselves.  Blake shares a ton of practical advice for readers to take the areas in which they feel challenged most, overcome whatever obstacles stand in their way, and really start something (anything) that matters. One of my favorite thoughts from the book was about clarity. So often we want every step of our future to be completely clear and well-planned before we want to pursue it. His words challenged me to see how nothing will ever be clear entirely until I'm in the moment. I need to fall in love with an idea, no matter how confusing and cloudy it may be, and follow it boldly because in the midst is where I will understand how it is going to work out.
B000M4RG42|1.0|Honestly, was this such a controversy over who exactly raised the flag on Iwo Jima that it warranted a feature film. The battle scenes are terrific but the whole angst over the three soldiers who are held up as heroes lost me. I just felt the movie was much ado about nothing. Worthy of maybe an hour documentary or investigative report on \\"60 Minutes\\" but not an entire movie.<br /><br />I also spent half the movie going: \\"Oh, look, it's the crazy murderous husband from 'Desperate Housewives.' There's the guy from 'Mad Men' and the crazy neighbor chick from 'Two And a Half Men.' \\" Very distracting to put such TV stars in the bit roles.<br /><br />I'd sooner have seen a straight war movie on the Iwo Jima invasion.<br />I sure hope \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" is a lot better.
B005V3F1EQ|4.0|While the vinyl album sounds pretty good, I was dissapointed to see there are liner notes or lyrics, just a cheap white liner. I bought the CD when it first came out, which has liner notes and art work, but those words are so small. This is my first Janes Addiction and I love it. I bought most of their back catalog and can see why long time fans are having a hard time enjoying this album, it is different than the first three, but sometime change is good. I am a new fan of this band and I hope they continue to write music together.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Whereas Flags Of Our Fathers falls flat, Letters From Iwo Jima rises to become certainly a front-runner as one of the best war films ever. The main reason this movie works so well is the acting which is beyond first-rate and the way the characters are drawn in a fantastic script. There are some \\"holy ____!\\" moments especially one suicide scene and a \\"flame-on\\" of a soldier in another. The way the movie was shot also helps evokes the barrenness of the real Iwo Jima and the way the island was turned into scorched earth.<br /><br />The extras are worthy of Oscar consideration as beyond the ubiquitous \\"making of\\" is a look at how they cast the film with the various Japanese actors' backgrounds and how they were chosen for their roles revealed. There is also thrown in the Japanese premiere and press conference which was a nice bonus touch (why don't more DVDs put those on their extras).<br /><br />If you understand Japanese (the movie is subtitled in English), they have tried to accurately recreate the way the Japanese language was spoken and used back in 1945 but early on you'll hear one soldier refer to Americans as \\"American\\" rather than \\"America-jin.\\" That was sort of odd.<br /><br />Also, as a huge cultural insight into the Japanese psyche back then and comparing it to the way it is now will be endlessly fascinating to any person who has spent any length of time in Japan. I'll leave that at that otherwise I'm apt to go off on some social anthropological rant.<br /><br />Anyway, on so many levels this movie works whether you're a fan of war movies or not.
B0011UBDTK|2.0|I was eagerly waiting for this set to arrive, cause always thought amazon products were the best. But these Cd's are far from good. I think they are used ones. Every episode gets stuck and I have to Stop resume and start the whole thing again.
B000MXPE7O|1.0|At 2 hours and 47 minutes this thing plods along and the worse thing about the DVD package is the extras are only \\"deleted scenes\\" meaning they actually edited this movie? What was it originally, an over 3-hour epic?<br /><br />I was pleading telepathically for Matt Damon's character to morph into Jason Bourne and start slapping people to wake up out of their comatose-like acting. Despite heavy hitters such as Angelina Jolie's lips, William Hurt's wig and Alec Baldwin's gut showing up to gain screen time, apparently Robert De Niro was too lazy to actually lift himself from a chair during two scenes in this movie.<br /><br />A complete mess at attempting to \\"explain\\" the CIA's rise in a movie. maybe it does depict accurately how the CIA started, works and goes about its business. All I can say on celluloid it's not worthy of watching unless you enjoy paint drying while waiting for a bus that never comes. Excuse the analogy but this topic is better served in book form or as a legit documentary. As a movie, this thing is a total snoozer.
B000025RX4|5.0|The writing and guitar playing on this is not Johnny's typical blues, but a collaboration with Rick Derringer on hard and funky, commercial rock songs. They trade leads on this with all the fire of Duane and Dickie, but with their own touch. I didn't listen to this album for about 20 years and when I heard it again, I immediately realized that this is one of the great lost gems of that era! Get it! Get it! GET IT!  Oh, bonus note, the original version of \\"Rock and Roll Hootchie Coo\\" is on here and it cuts the Rick Derringer solo version to ribbons.
B006FTCH2E|5.0|This film is well worth the money and I'd say is without a doubt the best film I've seen in the last few years. At a high level it's about atoning for guilt for an accident that destroy's another's life. It doesn't seem possible, but through a lot of work and in this particular space the atonement is accomplished.  Magnificent! I wish I could articulate this better because it is incredibly moving.

B0063IH60K|4.0|My early review was a bit critical.  Now that I've played about 2000 games, maybe more.  Maybe lots more.  I have to say BE CAREFUL.  It's addictive.<br />Its problems are mostly the kindle's: normal (my) fingers are too large for the electronic keyboard, and it often seems to respond whimsically.<br />Similarly, auto-fly works when the target is to the left.  When it's to the right, less often.
1451648537|5.0|Amazing book about an amazing man. I found the book very difficult to put down, but sometimes it was hard following the author as he skipped back and forth through time.  Excellent read for anyone in business or thinking about starting a business. I wish this book had been available when I was growing up. Actually, Steve Jobs was available when I was growing up. I just don't think anyone really knew what the heck he was doing or why he was doing it. Now we know.
1594202842|4.0|I happened to see this book in the ebook listing of my public library's catalog, and having read all the media hype about it, decided to put my name on the waiting list. I was fully prepared to hate this woman after all I had read about her. I was pleasantly surprised at my reaction to the book. It was written in a self-deprecating tongue-in-cheek manner rather than with a tone of superiority. The author was committed to what she describes as the Chinese method of parenting (or rather, her interpretation of it), which worked out fine for her older daughter, but not so well for the younger one. In fact, she was forced to modify her harsh approach with the younger one and give her some space.   In analyzing what she describes as the difference between Chinese and Western parenting, she makes some valid observations, but her approach is extreme. While she claims to have done all in the name of her children, to me what was most telling was reading the notes she left for her daughter Lulu, which she had inadvertently forgotten to put away while entertaining some of her Yale students in her daughter's practice room. The depth of research she put into her daughter's music was over the top and an example of extreme micromanaging. It is one thing to shepherd your children to music lessons and to make them practice, but the work involved in understanding the music and then giving specific advice as to how to execute the various sections of the composition made me wonder who she was doing it for. She documents her children's outbursts, but doesn't seem to address the accusation that she might be the frustrated musician, and maybe she would have been better off taking lessons herself and having her own creative outlet rather than foisting it upon her kids.  Still, she recognizes some of the shortcomings of her approach, but in the end, although she had to loosen the reins on her younger daughter, she is unapologetic. She even feels that her heavy-handed approach gave the rebellious daughter the tools to follow her own passion (tennis). In all, it was a thought-provoking memoir, designed to shock, but it did raise some valid issues regarding parenting styles.
B005HIEFC4|4.0|Worth watching once cute and funny just as I expected.  It is almost identical to the Ashton crusher comedy released a few weeks back.

B005MW8CUG|5.0|This is a lovely package - the shiny box is perfect, the postcards are lovely. The bonus CD is amazing - the Frail & Bedazzled demo is just shredtacular. And a DVD, at twenty-five dollars? More than worth it, even if you have a copy already. Perfect tribute to one of the best albums of the 90s.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is every bit as fun and addictive as the major MMO's out there. The world design is almost identical to WoW, but the game itself is far from stale. The controls are accesssble and well-thought out, while still being compact and low on screen clutter.  There is plenty to do, and the Arcadian server is pretty lively. Looks great, plays great, and I'm having a blast! Playing on a Kindle Fire and it runs super smooth.  Great job, Gameloft!

B003Y5H51K|3.0|I first popped this movie in expecting to be drawn in fast but I quickly got distracted doing something and pretty soon there was screaming like crazy in the cave and im like seriously what happened? So right i would go back and than get distracted again!!!...I finally just sat on my couch and determined as  all Heck to watch this movie all the way through. This movie was eh there was the obvious diving scenes that was pretty cool and I loved hearing them talk even though I ended up not really caring WHAT they were saying! I think there was some parts that could have been cut out like a lot of the fighting, i got it that daddy and son don't get along from their little chat on the screen so I didn't care for when they were arguing for how many minutes. It annoyed me that Josh blamed his father for that lady drowning...she was freaking tired. he should have demanded her to stay but since she went she wasn't in the state of mind and panicked so fast. I know nothing about diving but I'm sure that if she had gotten rest, her thoughts would have been a lot more clear. When the storm was first starting and those four people were coming back up and they started screaming and dadada, i think they could have made that scene into a 2 minute than instead of what it was. I loved George's character, when he got decompression sickness and was dying that made me upset. It really annoyed me when they were like telling Frank not to drown that one guy that broken every bone in his body like really, so you gonna let him be in pain? i was thinking you are idiots. When Frank and his son made it to where that military thing was they could have done something to get out in my opinion, and than why go back?!?! And all that drama between Karl between Frank and Josh my god....cut that whole crap out...Freaking psycho he deserved to get left alone in the first place. OOH and about his girlfriend if you are unexperienced why they heck are you going down there? I thought Karl said that they metat another expedition that maybe she knew something but than Frank was she came down here knowing nothing, mistake number one and mistake number 2....blah blah blah...where was the sense from her and her boyfriend obviously not where its supposed to be!!! When the son drowned his daddy cuz he was hurt and slowly dying, not gonna lie it made me tear up cuz at that point you just saw that the boy finally understood his father. But ya know after the father died, I really didn't care if Josh made it or not. I think Frank should have gone all the way, he got everyone to the point where they were and yea he should have been the one to conquer it...but eh whatevs..... I think if you enjoy watching movies about people going to unknown places and something happens to them that they start dying off than you may enjoy this movie....if not than you may not. if you are weary rent it....no harm in it!!

1594484805|5.0|Drive is about \\"the 3rd drive\\" which relates to people's intrinsic motivation (rather than basic motivation and extrinsic motivation). It is a book that exposes the research data related to intrinsic motivation and tries to convince the reader that there is \\"something wrong\\" with most traditional management theories related to motivation. (and he does a good job convincing).<br /><br />The book is an easy read and written a little bit too popular. (this was pointed out very well by the great Amazon review of Walter Bock). Still it is worth a read. The book is structured in 2 parts and a bunch of appendixes. Part 1 talks about the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards and why the external rewards don't work (at least, don't work in a modern knowledge-worker setting). The second part then answers the question: \\"If extrinsic motivation doesn't work, how can we create an environment in which people are motivated\\".<br /><br />Dan Pink's answer: 3 elements are important for intrinsic motivation:<br />- Mastery<br />- Self-direction<br />- Purpose<br /><br />Mastery is about getting good at something. Self-direction is about being in control of your own life and decisions. Purpose is about trying to achieve something meaningful. (these 3 points are very similar to the work of Richard Hackman, which was referred at times).<br /><br />The book is a very easy read, well written. It contains interesting stories and facts and does a great job at convincing the reader. This book is important as extrinsic rewards are still everywhere and are destroying the motivation to do work. It will take a long time to change that, but this book is one step in the right direction. An important book and thus, even with its drawbacks, still 5 stars.
B0032KLAKE|2.0|Again Hollywood uses its facilities to slur the Catholic church in particular and Christianity in general.  Gere is the slick, bigshot lawyer who cares little for the truth.  To him the end, which is winning his case, justifies the means.  No one in the movie is a decent human being.  The Catholic bishop who is murdered brutally near the start of the movie is a sexual pervert, presumably murdered by the overgrown altar boy (19 years old) caught fleeing the bloody scene.  Gere's legal opponent is the DA Laura Linney, Gere's ex-girlfriend.  She is clever too, but not quite as clever as Gere.  The ending shows the triumph of evil in a dysfunctional world.  If you like movies with no hero and a hedonistic, atheistic theme, you may like this tripe.  But it has no surprising twists as some have written here.  The ending can be predicted by anyone with a normal functioning brain.  The only satisfaction one can get from watching this is Gere's ultimate defeat.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This Blu Ray edition is excellent...It comes with both the black and white version and the colorized version. A lot of people claim to only be a fan of the black and white version \\"so was I\\" but, after seeing the colorized version I was truly impressed with the extra depth that it added to the picture and I may be converted to the colorized version. I have the older DVD Silver Screen edition in black and white and was happy with it, but after comparing the two...hands down the Blu Ray wins, both black and white and colorized.  I say this because the Blu Ray version is so clean it is hard to believe that this movie was released on December 20, 1946.  The only flaw with this movie \\"that I have seen\\" and it is on both my DVD and this Blu Ray is on chapter 15-01:13:55 where the screen size changes and at Chapter 18-01:26:57 where it changes back to normal, this may have been a flaw from the original editing of the movie...other than that if you want a dramatic increase in picture quality then go with this Blu Ray version, you will not be dissapointed.  Oh, as for the sound quality, I could not tell the difference between my DVD and this Blu Ray as they are both THX certified with enhanced sound clarity.  Enjoy
1439192812|5.0|(disclaimer: I have scanned through this book and read a couple of chapters. So this won't be a direct review of the chapters of this book, rather it is about the impact it could have.)  There are so many schools of theology and debate which mould young minds to argue against reason \\"intelligently\\". These include tactics of sneaky diversion from the topic in question (usually about evidence) AND ontological arguments that are more easily absorbed by children than some of the sciences. They also learn to demonize any hope of themselves becoming free/rational thinkers. (I've had firsthand experience).  These schools/environments have produced people like William Lane Craig and Zakir Naik (who I believe are the most dangerous weapons against civilization).  I find it analogous to - the difference in mentality between people who are well-read and travelled versus small-town folk who aren't/haven't. They are usually genuinely honest and nice people, but differ from the fortunately educated. It shows in their ignorance about a lot of things like race, religion. (I have noticed this in every country I've been to).  However the isolation from rational thinking happens even in the most educated of environments. Because children are brought up by parents following religious traditions, they soak in anything and the grown-up religious community make them believe this nonsense (as opposed to other fairy-tales) even when they reach adolescence. And the cycle continues with every generation..  Beyond a certain age, it is very difficult to undo certain ingrained ideas/concepts. The concept of rational inquiry is the key to living a civilized life. For instance, not supporting a presidential candidate because of the God he/she believes in. Or not wasting your money with priests/evangelicals. Or not being gullible for recruitment by a radical leader because of the pleasures of the afterlife.   This book could make a more inquiring next generation, who give more importance to thingslike climate change, rather than destroying the forces of \\"evil\\" on earth.  At the very least, if you don't want your children to sound like the one/two star reviewers of this book, I urge you to save a child and buy this book.  - MJ

B004HILSZ2|2.0|I'll try to avoid harping on irrelevant-but-obnoxious (to me) traits of his book, but one is that this is a book of devotion to the almighty dude: I'm a man, and I found the male chauvinism nauseating.  He makes little effort to hide the fact that he's genuinely, madly, hotly in lust with several of the hedge fund principals, including Salomon Bros. government bond trader, Craig Coats Jr.--whom Mallaby introduces as a \\"tall, handsome, charismatic stud... whose main tool was a firm belief in his own instinct\\" (p.222).  Women in the book are at best worshipful supporters and at worst, queens (such as Mary Meeker, analyst for Morgan Stanley, p.259).  Probably because she was an indispensable source of information, Carole Loomis is treated neutrally.<br /><br />This gets more irritating when you consider the sympathy, even vicarious anguish, that Mallaby feels for billionaires he likes when they lose a billion or two.  Their prior winnings are evidence of their status as superlative beings, but their subsequent misfortunes are heart-wrenching tragedies.  It's probably why narrative journalism and investing are especially bad together: in financial markets, every loss is somebody's win, but if the winner is in the room, it's joyful.<br /><br />Mallaby often \\"steps back\\" from the narrative to describe what lesson the reader is supposed to have learned from what has just \\"happened.\\"  Nearly always, this lesson is spectacularly wrong.  For example, Mallaby describes the manner in which the Quantum Fund (led by Druckenmiller and Soros) shorted the UK pound in 1992, thereby wrecking the [[ASIN:0255365667 ERM]], then, in 1997, squashed the Thai economy--the entire economy--like an unsuspecting kitten.  That's how Mallaby describes it, and so far, it holds up in court.  The team from Quantum shows up like Columbo, discovers the Thai authorities have been concealing the true nature of their balance sheet, and bust them--in the process, ruining the vast majority of Thai households and enriching Soros, among others.<br /><br />Like a psychopath's best groupie, Mallaby accepts without reservation that 100% of blame for the catastrophe goes to the Thai authorities for failing to do what the people at Quantum wanted them to do in the first place--viz., devalue the baht and make good the Quantum short on the baht.  He repeats this narrative many times in the remainder of the chapter, so that he starts to sound like [[ASIN:B00118T63C Anton Chigurh's]] lawyer, if he had one.  The concept that the authorities in countries like Thailand or the UK have other prevailing concerns besides appeasing the demands of shorts is simply too outlandish for Mallaby.<br /><br />Later, the Quantum fund decides to take an opposite position in Indonesia (hedge funds ideally can switch positions so quickly they make money on both sides of a temporary spike in prices).  This time, the expectations of the Quantum fund managers were dashed.  Mallaby cheerfully takes this as evidence that Quantum fund cannot possibly be a superpredator (p.209), and later, when Soros personally loses hundreds of millions on a rogue investment in Russia, he again (p.219) insists that this \\"makes nonsense\\" of the idea of Soros as a superpredator.<br /><br />Mallaby, in other words, has learned one lesson from the hedge funds and applied it to the ideological point he is pounding: if your man makes money, it's because he's the greatest mind since Jesse Livermore.  If he loses it, it proves that he's just a soft touch.  He repeats this sort of head-I-win, tails-I'm-too-good-for-this-world narrative with the Farralon Fund--and none of the inferences he makes about that particular story even make sense.  He makes no secret of the fact that he thinks critics of the funds are disgusting--literally, aesthetically, disgusting--and mocks them on the rare occasion he brings them up.<br /><br />At first I was mildly interested in his descriptions of how funds differed, but it became obvious he was toobesotted with the man-musk, and too bored with the technical details, to actually provide anything but the most vague summaries.  There's not really anything of financial interest that wouldn't have been readily available from reading a Fortune magazine profile online, and that's not saying very much at all.ical details, to actually provide anything but the most vague summaries.

0307888681|4.0|Seriously scary and realisitic 'history' of worldwide war against zombies....i watched 'walking dead' for season 1 and a few eps of season 2 and i still can't remember the names of any of the characters - neither did i really care about what happened to any of them...reading this book is a different experience and one that the writers/creators of 'walking dead' should observe and incorporate into that show...i loved the set-up of the book - interviews all over the world with different people about how the war started, progressed and ended (sort-of ended).  there are some very sly references to actual pop culture celebs and phenoms...my favorite oral history was about the 'real world/celebrity rehab' mansion filled with desperate celebs and their hangers-on - it is exactly what would happen in real life awry with zombies...there are lots of other memorable characters and the portrayal of a world overrun with the walking dead is chilling and realistic and foreboding.  while reading it you will be placing yourself into the various stories and thinking - what would i do to try and survive?  i really hope every government official who has anything to do with disease control and disaster prep is reading this book and taking notes!

0877180121|4.0|I usually teach older children piano, but I recently added younger children to my classes.  So I wanted a book that was simple and easy to use and wouldn't frustrate the younger students.  The notes are large and lessons are presented in a logical sequence.  However, I feel that more pieces should be given to reinforce notes learned before new notes are introduced.  To make up for this deficit, I sometimes have students play the same pieces over several times (even when they come on another day); young children can get bored with this because they feel they already know the piece being played.

0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus follows two groups of people in two timelines that eventually converge. The first plot surrounds Celia and Marco, two brilliant young magicians who have been pitted against each other by their masters in a complex game, with the Night Circus as its venue, that even the two competitors don't understand the rules of.  The second plot follows Bailey, a young man who dreads becoming a farmer like his father and finds his only solace in the Night Circus when it comes to town.  I can see why this book creates such a divided reaction -- the plot moves along languidly, dropping small hints and revealing clues slowly as we spend much of 300 pages just getting to know and understand the world of The Night Circus, as well as its characters, and then racing along for the last 60 pages or so.  This is one of those books that could not only divide people, but a person reading it at the right or wrong time might love it or hate it.  Personally, I loved it. I enjoyed feeling almost like one of the Night Circus patrons, moving in awe from tent to tent, wanting to explore each square inch of the circus grounds.  Morgenstern creates magical-realism at its finest, blending the mundane and the fantastic, and leaving some of the questions about how it works unanswered, to keep that edge of mysteriousness.  I will say I found a few things at the climax to be a tad deus ex machina-y, and I feel it ended somewhat abruptly. (Personally, I would have been happy if it hadn't ended at all.)  Overall though, I thought it was a great book that really captured my imagination.
0240810961|5.0|The title of the review states it,  this is the best book on drawing I have ever read.  The book is a bunch of short chapters further grouped by an overall topic.  It is the first of a two book series.  The editor of the book took lectures by Walt Stanchfield (a Disney animator) and put them together in book format.  Because of the shortness of chapters, it is easy to pick and put down the book after a short reading (like reading magazines) and not feel like you have to read it all the way through.  I also think you can put what you learn in just one chapter to use right away without having to read further.    Though the lectures are geared towards animators, anyone drawing (at any skill level) will learn from this book.  I think my drawings (which have nothing to do with animation) have improved since reading this book.  And I have a better idea of how to approach my drawings instead of looking at a blank sheet of paper and thinking \\"ok what now\\".  What you will not learn is mechanics.  You will not learn how to put pencil or pen to paper (though there was one chapter on holding the pencil loser).  You will not learn anatomy.  You will not learn the correct way to draw a hand or face or where to place subjects within a drawing.  There are plenty of books on mechanics.  This book is about taking what mechanics you have and making your drawings better.  What you will learn is how to make your drawing more interesting.  How to capture the essence of what you are trying to draw.  How to get more realism (not realism from a physical sense - wow that is photographic - but realism in the action sense - yes that is what it woul look like if someone was holding a box and trying to lift it).  This is done through a series of text and example sketches (some from the lectures which are very sketchy and some from Disney animation).  About the only thing I would have liked to have known is how large the originals were.  I like to compare my drawings to what I am learning and oneof the things I like to know is time it took to draw and size.  I highly recommend this book and I am anxious to read the next.
0316154687|3.0|Is there anyone better to read when you want to relax and laugh a bit, than David Sedaris? I still think \\"Santaland Diaries\\" is must-read material for this time of year and \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is one of the funniest books I've ever read, full stop. So it's a given that when he publishes a new book I have to buy it immediately. I know, \\"When You are Engulfed in Flames\\" came out in 2008, this is 2011, but I did try and read it 3 years ago but I gave up frustrated. The solution to completing it this time? - audiobooks.<br /><br />Sedaris reading his stories is a different beast to reading them yourself. I love podcasts and felt that him reading his stories was like listening to a podcast, telling everyone funny stories that had happened to him, and so I got through this book in a day after a few enjoyable hours spent listening to him while driving.<br /><br />His bad baby sitter, Mrs Peacock, was a funny and strange character who demanded back scratches and that David and his sisters clean her house while their parents were on holiday; his Italian neighbour in New York, Helen, who was this extremely bullying and unlikable person and who beat up a disabled kid for accidentally pocketing a biro of hers; and the Normandy neighbour who turned out to be child molester.<br /><br />While his characterisations of real people is always brilliant, what I liked better were the anecdotes centred around himself - arguing with cab drivers for whom English was a second language; giving up smoking in Japan; or sitting on a plane in first class next to a Polish man who couldn't stop crying as he'd just buried his mother. The foreign element tips it over for me as it reminds me of the brilliance of \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" which also focused on language and communication issues. And most touching of all were his love letters to his boyfriend Hugh, for who is clear he is deeply in love with.<br /><br />\\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\\" is not his best book but definitely an entertaining audiobook, particularly when Sedaris attempts voices of some of the characters. The anecdotes are far from stale but also not as entertaining as other volumes and this is why it took me a few years to get around to finishing it. Having done so though, I'm glad I did, and can recommend this as an antidote to hours of tedious driving.aris attempts voices of some of the characters.

B006GRBK4G|5.0|This picks up where Mark Neale left us in \\"Faster\\", his panoramic story of the MotoGp era from 2001 to 2002. The film mainly focuses on the 2008 to 2010 seasons. Despite the cover, Rossi on the malevolent Ducati, the 2011 season is barley mentioned.   But what a story. This is motorcycle racing in its glory days. Most of the narrative is around Valentino Rossi, one of the greatest sportsmen of our time and unequivocally one of the best there has even been in the premier class. The basic story, his move to Yamaha, quick dispatch of Biaggi, Gibernau and up to 2010, of the new pretenders is expertly told through interviews with riders, the eloquent Michael Scott, ebullient Julian Ryder and the proto-Nietzschean philosophy of Dr Costa. Along the way, we get insights from the always effacing Colin Edwards, a surprisingly mature Jorge Lorenzo, taciturn Stoner and from the up and coming Marco Simoncelli, who's sadly premature death gives the film a very touching aura.   The action shots are stunning. We see bike control around switchbacks, chicanes, slide saves and we learn about the physics of 1000 tires, breaking at 1.6G and the dead on accuracy of Rossi at Lap 1 and Lap 25 in practice. The Mugello crash, which allowed the field to rearrange itself in Rossi's absence, is given the importance it deserves.   The movie is really Rossi but all the better for it. Neale is clearly impressed and delighted by the rider community but he makes no bones that the Rossi phenomenon is likely to be stopped by injury one day and he has caught it at its very best.   If you liked On Any Sunday, Dust to Glory, Faster, then this for you. If you need waking up after a slouch Christmas dinner, then this is a must...for all the family. Also some great bonuses, especially the Red Neck/Real physics section.

Its an excellent movie and the actors and actresses are excellent. This was the movie that introduced me to Dudley Moore and I am sad to here he has passed on. I hope the other other acters and actresses are still working. Next to the remake of Miracle on 34th Street this is my favoite Christmas movie. Or at least one of many. This movie started a tradition for my famiy where we would go to see a Christmas movie in the theater the day after Thanksgiving or as some people call it black Friday. Unfortunaly it ended a few years ago because other than tv movies they dont make those movies anymore. Still any Christmas movie is one that I like. Merry Christmas.
0385534639|2.0|Incredibly boring. Yes, the imagery Erin uses to depict things in the novel are flowery; however, the book dragged on painfully, and was completely anti-climatic. I almost closed the book halfway through and shelved it for good, but I'm not one to give up on things I start.
0525423656|2.0|The first book in the series was definitely better. I expected some more forbidden romance going on but it was mainly about climbing through the desert. There was more romance when the two were apart longing for each other. I also found the bit about the farmers, the rising, and the enemy all a little confusing. The lines were a little too blurred and too little explained. Don't get me wrong, it was okay, but Matched was definitely better.

B0032O6S4I|4.0|We got this for my son when he was 3 and he loved it.  When we first got it we did not show him all of the tiny pieces, but put together the main zoo entrance and pens and gace him the incredible animals and the people (without all the accessories). This was the perfect decision.  Now those parts aren't lost and a year later he is old enough to play with them.  He loves all the plants and the baby.  The moving elephant ears are awesome and he thinks that making the giraffes eat from that tall basket is awesome.  He plays with this with his older sister and tons of friends and they are able to use the zoo as a zoo, a dungeon, a hideaway and many other things.<br /><br />I love how realiztic the animals are and all the wonderful little details that came with the zoo.  Just be warned the pieces are tiny.  There are little souvenir animals that are smaller than a fingernail.  So if your kids are younger you may want to hold back some pieces until they are older.<br /><br />We have a playmobil little pieces box that I keep and take out when I am with the kids that houses all those accessories from the different sets.  Works great!

There are always fresh ideas on this show and even though they face some of the same villians, you will never know the ending.

0756404738|5.0|Overall: 9.5/10  A Wise Man's Fear isn't quite as easy to get pulled into as The Name of the Wind.  All of the same qualities are present in the sequel to make it a great book, but everything feels a little bit more forced than the first.  This isn't to say that it is bad, but A Wise Man's Fear doesn't pull you into Kvothe's world quite as completely as its predecessor until more than halfway through the book.  However, there are a great many contributing factors.  First of all, The Wise Man's Fear is about half again as long as The Name of the Wind, which means that it necessarily moves a little bit more slowly.  Add to this the fact that the University, fresh and new when Kvothe arrives in the first book, is now a little old hat, and you have a necessary start to the book that isn't as exciting as it could be.  This combined with a large number of intermissions between the beginning and middle that pull us out of Kvothe's story and into the present day lead to a slightly boring and somewhat disjointed start to the second book.  However, keep reading because, the second half of the book is stellar.  Writing: 10/10  The listening experience doesn't changed significantly from the first to second book.  The writing still flows smoothly, and the reader does an excellent job, the primary difficulty in the first half of the book is chapter organization and subject matter.  However, much of what is somewhat boring in the first half is necessary for later in the story, so it's worth the effort to read.  Characters: 9.5/10  Again, Rothfuss leads us deep into Kvothe's mind and personal worldview.  Kvothe is still an excellent character, but the secondary characters in The Wise Man's Fear are much more real than those of the first book.  Pella, Simmon, and even Devi are more fully developed, and new secondary characters like the Maer Alvaron, Tempi, and Vashet are also very well developed.  These strong secondary characters allow Kvothe to feel even more real by comparison, which leads to a more strongly character driven book.  World: 10/10  Again Rothfuss' world is excellently developed, from the forests Vint, to Felurian's twilight glade, to the windy hills of Ademre Rothfuss paints a picture of his world that is both believable and beautiful.  He includes a vast amount of detail that will keep world lovers dedicated for ages.  This is still where his writing shines the most, and I have not doubt that it will continue to do so.  Plot: 10/10  The plot of Kvothe's life takes an interesting turn in this book.  I won't say much, because I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but if you are a discerning reader then you'll probably catch the gist of it by the end of the first book, although I must admit that the execution of this twist is wonderful.  Pacing: 7/10  As I mentioned above, The Wise Man's Fear has some pacing issues.  These aren't difficult to overcome, the story is still interesting and the writing is still good, but almost the first half of the book left me with the feeling that Rothfuss was simply waiting until he could start the second half.  He fills the space with interesting stories, and necessary events to get from place to place, but it leaves the reader with the feeling that something is missing.  Commentary: 8.0/10  Rothfuss' commentary in The Wise Man's Fear was more blatant that in The Name of the Wind.  However, it reminded me of an extended version of Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, with different ideas presented through cultural conflict.  Kvothe travels from the University to Severen (in Vint) and then to Felurian's glade and then to Ademre, before returning to Severen and the University.  In his travels Kvothe encouters several different cultures, and much of the commentary in the book is presented in the form of conflicting ideas in and between these cultures, and Kvothe's reactions.  While very different than the commentary in The Name of the Wind, the commentary in The Wise Man's Fear is about equally well presented, with some ideas presented more strongly or completely than others.  However, like Stranger in a Strange Land, I do not agree with a lot of the commentary that Rothfuss make in this book.  Conclusion:  The Wise Man's Fear is definitely worth reader, especially if you like The Name of the Wind, but don't expect it to be the same book - of course, that would be boring.

B004EPYZTE|4.0|I am well aware that critics bashed the crap out of this movie. And honestly speaking, I know Conan the Barbarian isn't the greatest movie in the world. At the same time, it's not the worst movie of 2011 either. It's decent at best. On a more personal level, I was entertained from start to finish. The movie is extremely reminiscent of a 90's B movie. That may be why critics weren't too kind to it, and audiences are divided. For the average moviegoer, this movie boils down to personal preference.   For me, I really liked it. From the action scenes to the casting, the film does its job of being a solid action movie. The greatest strength of this film is Jason Momoa. He is Conan. He has the physique of an 80's action hero (think of Stallone or Schwarzenegger), but the personality of a modern anti-hero. The question you may be asking is if he's better than Schwarzenegger's Conan? The answer is based solely on personal preference. Both of them play Conan equally well, but their different. Schwarzenegger's Conan was stoic and cold. Momoa's Conan is primal and purely instinctual. Again, I love both, and I think Momoa makes an amazing Conan.   Stephen Lang's Khalar Zym, was nowhere near as amazing as James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom. But you could tell Lang had fun playing Zym. And when an actor has fun playing a villain, especially one that is as clichéd and cartoony as Zym, you can't help but be sucked in. And I fell for Lang's Zym.   There are problems with this movie. There is no denying that. But every problem I have lies with Marcus Nispel's direction and the film's three different writers. I think the choices Nispel made during filming and post-production weren't acceptable. And the script, after three different writers, still needed polishing. But by sheer luck, Conan the Barbarian is the director's best film to date, due to his star's Momoa and Lang. They carry this movie into B movie (or passable) territory that hopefully will find an audience.   There are plenty out there who will disagree with me liking this film, but I say give the film a chance. It's not for everyone. Conan the Barbarian isn't better than Schwarzenegger's classic, but it's not worse either. It's a good action film, with a good cast, and great set pieces. One thing I should mention for Blu Ray fans is this Blu Ray disc is reference quality. The picture and sound are demo worthy. As for the 3D quality... it's not horrible, but there are better 3D Blu Rays out there. It's average. There's some depth, and some pop out moments, but overall, it doesn't compare to Avatar or Beauty and the Beast 3D Blu Rays. For the price though, if you're a fan of the film, or end up liking it, it's worth buying.

Yes, they take the tempo too slowly in \\"Tempus Fugit,\\" but it's really great to have some Drama tracks on a Yes live album at last.  Benoit David sounds pretty good throughout, but you do notice the difference between him and Jon Anderson on longer held notes where his voice stands out.  When singing with Squire, you really cannot tell the difference.  On the other hand, you can easily hear why Trevor Horn insisted on changing out Oliver Wakeman from the band.  He uses some truly appalling patches for the sounds, and he misses quite a few notes.  Adam Wakeman would have been up to the job, but I think Oliver would not have gotten it without the name.  Tom Brislin and Igor Khoroshev were far better within Yes.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|About halfway through the DVD.  So impressed that I realized I wanted to write a brief 5-star review.    I admit that I was worried this got rushed out in light of her health problems. I was way off.  Yes, as some folks have already noted, her voice is a little scratchy at certain points.  But she sounds (and looks!) absolutely fantastic.  Really nice production all the way around on the DVD/CD combo makes this a must-purchase. I just sent one to my mom for her birthday and I'll be gifting this all over the place.  I almost lost my mind during the Turning Tables/Set Fire To The Rain back-to-back portion.  Wow...   If, God forbid, she's never able to sing another note, she'll have left us with this spectacular performance.  About the two versions.  She doesn't curse constantly, but there's enough on there that you might consider getting the edited version if you want to play the concert for children.

B00000IQV7|5.0|Robin Williams depicts a warm and charming personality driven to be his own best person under incredibly challenging academic and internship circumstances.  I found the additional clips depicted the real Patch Adams integrity in action in everyday medical practice.

This movie is a great gift.
0393338398|3.0|I'm a huge Michael Lewis fan but I actually found this to be his weakest book so far. Being European baseball is not a great sport for me but as he usually writes about other subject is an compelling and easy to understand way I thought this would be a hit as well.   While its a compelling story about how to do things differently it never really caught me to the same degree as his other books. If you are new to Michael Lewis start with another book unless you are a big baseball fan let not the big movie cover win you over - he has too many other good books out there.
B005LJK3AC|3.0|This is a solid, middle of the road comedy.  Not near as sexy as I was hoping and not near as funny as I was hoping.  That said, well worth the 99 cents we paid to rent it.

B005M2A4D4|2.0|What a shame.  The performances by Smith and Gillian continue to be cartoonish caricatures that are suitable (I suppose) for pre-teens, but not very engaging for a more mature audience.  In addition, now we have a Doctor who not only condones the use of violence and killing but actually states that he \\"kinda likes that idea\\".  So much for \\"the man who never would\\".    We also have some new universal constants.  Apparently \\"fixed points in time\\" that could never be altered, now can.  Good luck to the writers developing future episodes with that immutable constant of the Whoverse now gone.  But not to worry, because now we have a new constant as replacement... evidently now the one defining characteristic of the Doctor is that \\"the Doctor lies\\".  How sad that it has come to this.  The brilliance of the Tennant and Eccleston years is gone.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|This new four disc set finally finds all four extant versions of Blade Runner(released June/82...has it really been that long?!),in one convenient package.We have the original 1982 version,the 1982 International Cut(with extra tweaks and footage),the 1992 Directors Cut(with more tweaks and the unicorn footage added) and finally the 2007 Final Cut,most preferred by Scott and its restoration personally supervised by him...and it certainly shows.<br />As to what version is the best,well many better qualified reviewers and people other than myself have weighed in on this one,but I must say after a thorough look see at them all I can say I still prefer the original version;while at the same time I can see and appreciate Scott's Final version also.The original version just has so much more depth to me.The film's dystopian vision combines a future time frame with,in this case,a decidedly 40s look and feel.It is all reinforced with Deckards narration throughout which evokes a Bogart character of Sam Spade or Phillip Marlowe.To add to this is the \\"fat man\\" Egyptian who Deckard questions in regards to the snake scales,replete with the white suit and red felt hat,which brings back a Sydney Greenstreet character from the Maltese Falcon or Casablanca.Furthermore we have Rachel whose dress and smoking bring back memories of a Joan Crawford or Bette Davis.The cherry on the cake is the entire look of the city which has a good dollop of Metropolis with a dash of Logan's Run thrown in to boot.This look is in all versions of course,but that mixed with the aforementioned attributes,creates,for me at least,a much richer viewing experience.<br />The Final cut is beautifully and lovingly restored.Scott has gone to great lengths and has taken care of some needed fixes like the slightly out of sync lips-to-voice in the latter part of the film.You might notice near the end where the dove flies out of Roys hands and upward,the sky is blue in the previous versions.In the final new version the sky is grey.It makes sense as one may ask where is all the rain coming from?One bugaboo they have NOT taken care of in any version is that of Leon's conversation.Specifically,Leon,a replicant,has infiltrated the Tyrell Corp.and is under going a routine verbal test with a corporate employee at the beginning of the film.Just before Leon kills that employee,he says\\"Let me tell you about my mother\\".On a playback of the convo in a Spinner later on,Deckard now hears\\"I'll tell you about my mother\\". All they had to do was switch the first convo into the playback in the Spinner,but.... .<br />I won't go into any great detail on the(now)well known plot,but for those who may be new to the film,I will give you the Readers Digest version.The time is 2019 and the main protagonist is Deckard(Harrison Ford)a so called Blade Runner.He is charged with running down and killing rogue replicants,built by the Tyrell Corp.A small cadre of replicants have come back to the city to infiltrate the corporation,intent unknown.As the film progresses we find out they want their incept or inception/creation dates,altered,thus extending their lives.It turns out this is impossible and the film comes down to a showdown between the last remaining replicant Roy(Rutger Hauer,in possibly his best role ever)and Deckard.Hanging off a building girder and about to fall to his death,Roy saves Deckards life,and as he watches Roy die he is left to ponder why.Deckard returns home to Rachel(a replicant who Deckard has fallen in love with),and they both flee the city for a new life.<br />All the films stars both major and minor including:James Wong as Chew,Darryl Hannah as Pris,E.Emmett Walsh as Bryant,James Olmos as Gaff,Joe Turkel as Tyrell,Joanna Cassidy as Zhora,Brion James as Leon,etc.,ALL to a person do a wonderful jobs in fleshing out their roles.Scott does a great job in bringing the ever wet and depressing atmosphere of the city to life.Vangellis,who was on a role from his previous award winning triumph the year before for his music in Chariots of Fire,is on hand to provide the always subtle but appropriate music for this film.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1.The first three films have been remastered nicely and all come on disc three.That is alot of info to put onto one disc and I thought the compression ratio would become a factor but it didn't surface as one..surprisingly.The Final cut is on disc one.All discs by the way are feathered one over the other in groups of two,on either side of the case which opens up.Extras abound here and they include:a new documentary on the making of the film with deleted and altered scenes,numerous featurettes new and old on the production,design and restoration of the film.There are enough extras here to keep a fan glued to his or her seat for literally hours.<br />All in all a highly recommended DVD set.A remarkable job in remastering and restoration is in evidence here and all versions are here for your enjoyment.My preferred version is the original but I also can see and appreciate Scott's vision for the Final cut and like that too.The beauty of this however is that we can all decide where our loyalties lie in the end.or his music in Chariots of Fire,is on hand to provide the always subtle but appropriate music for this film.

B004QK5N5W|3.0|This very basic adapter works, but it comes off way too easily.  Once you connect it to your Ipad or Iphone (I have the Ipad 2), try not to move your device or the adapter will partially slide off and you will lose the signal.

B003Y5H5AG|5.0|First of all,  I don't usually take the time to write reviews but thought I had to this time, after seeing all the one star reviews panning the film.  And I must say that I don't know what those people were watching.  This is a great family film with comedy, action, and emotion.    PROS -  1) Keeps your interest throughout the whole film.  2) Good Clean Fun, no deragatory speech or offensive language, no smarty pants characters who make others feel down (like the Chipmunks Part 2).  3) Lot's of funny moments which will make you laugh.  CONS -  None really, except if you want to see a traditional animated film, this is not it.  This movie has real humans with computer generated Smurf characters.  BOTTOM LINE - It's fun, relaxing, and will make you feel good at the end.
B0034G4P94|5.0|This movie was pretty incredible. Excellent acting, sweet story and amaaaaaaaaazing fight scenes. Sooo bummed it didn't do better at the box office. A MUST SEE!!!!
B001BTG3OQ|3.0|This is a decent speedlight.  But I have two issues with it.  1) The hole where you put the sync cord or the cord to the Pocket Wizard is too big and the cord falls out.  The only way to fix this has been for me to keep a rubberband around the cord pushing it into the hold tightly.  Even a screw-in cord hasn't been successful. The other issue is the over-heating.  It doesn't happen that often but it's annoying when it does happen.  At least the unit stops firing and doesn't commit suicide by overheating or that would make me REALLY angry.    But overall, it gets the job done and batteries last pretty long too.
B004EPYZPS|3.0|I've been a fan of J.J. Abrams since Lost, Cloverfield, and the reboot of Star Trek.  Paired with Steven Spielberg, I was expecting something great, especially when critics were praising this film so highly.  Many people will say it's a cross between The Goonies, ET, and several other childhood films, which I will agree is *mostly* correct.  However, I found that it seems to lose it's tone about halfway through and the overall theme of childhood innocence gets lost.  I will say the acting is fantastic.  With children as lead actors, their roles are cast perfectly.  A little cliched, perhaps, but the band of friends fits well.  Kyle Chandler as the sheriff/father fits his role quite nicely as well.  The premise builds a nice story of a strained father-son relationship after the death of the mother, as well as takes us through the bonds of friendship and the childhood fun of making a home movie.  On a cinematic standpoint, the camerawork and score work well with the film.  Abrams has always gone over the top to drop the audience into a colorfully distinctive world full of emotion and life, and this film is no different.  What I didn't enjoy were certain elements to the alien/monster itself, which caused the story to stray from being about childhood innocence amidst a supernatural crisis to being about children stuck in a violent battle between humans and the alien.  Ignoring the cliched components of a secret military train getting derailed, I had expected this film to veer toward being about an ET-like creature, where ET was misunderstood by scientists but was a caring creature deep down that only a child could understand.  This alien, however, doesn't seem to value human life and showed no restraint in lashing out with unsympathetic violence (aside from a random scientist it decided to bond with early in the film).  Some may argue that this is a more realistic or simply different portrayal, which is better since Abrams most likely didn't want to remake ET.  However,I felt that it took away from the warmness that the film could have offered and made it more gritty as it got to the end.  Aside from that, I'm not a fan of movies where suspending disbelief is overly necessary, but this film absolutely requires it.  From the overly dramatic train wreck scene to the battle where kids are running around unchallenged by the plethora of soldiers, I found myself sighing with disappointment.  That and, despite being called \\"Super 8\\", the kids' film really doesn't play as big of a role as I would have thought.  In fact, in the last third, it is virtually nonexistent.  It was a nice attempt to create a unique film and I will not deny that the basic premise, acting, and camerawork are fantastic.  However, I just didn't feel the *magic* that many critics said this film had.

038572179X|5.0|It's not often a book can rank on Time's list of 100 Greatest Novels of All Time and still be a good leisure read, at least for a seventeen-year-old.  However, Atonement's riveting and unique plotline set in the fascinating world of war-ravaged England and France kept me in eager anticipation from page one.    Ian McEwan has a way of writing that brings out the beauty of simple objects and events, such as the broken vase that came to represent the relationship between Robbie and Cecilia: not much at first glance, but containing too much sentimentality to let go.  McEwan lays down the facts in exquisite detail but offers minimal emotional pull, forcing the reader to create their own and stretch their imagination.  On multiple occasions, I found myself watching the scene unfold instead of just reading about it.  For example, the scene involving the RAF officer at Dunkirk actually made me pity the officer, when I wasn't focused on my anger towards the soldiers.  Getting emotional about a book was a first for me.    The book in general is captivating, as it takes a twist to the typical war-time love story.  Instead of focusing on the couple, the story follows the regret of the girl who separated them.  The separate parts allow readers to understand the different sides of the same story and set the playing field for dramatic irony.    Unlike the movie, which has a simpler job in creating foreshadowing, the book keeps you guessing until the end as to who really committed the crime by choosing to point the finger at a minor character that the reader never meets.  I won't spoil the end, but it has a Shutter Island-esque effect that makes one wonder how much was a lie.  Some readers may be dissatisfied that the story didn't go their way, but I personally appreciated McEwan's dedication to telling a believable, individual story.  The multiple surprises tucked into the last half of part three and the epilogue, combined with McEwan's flowing, descriptive paragraphs, will makethis book one of the most memorable ones on my shelf, and I look forward to rediscovering it in coming years.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This album opens with the line \\"Happiness hit her like a train on a track,\\" which reflects the tone of everything that comes after. Everything, even pleasure and love, comes out of Florence Welch's artistry like a fist in the gut, unexpected and brutal. She grabs bluesy traditions in songs like \\"Hurricane Drunk\\" and \\"Kiss With a Fist,\\" then hit a lush prog rock tone in \\"Rabbit Heart,\\" keeping us constantly on our toes.  Florence's use of retro traditions amid contemporary sounds reminds me of acts like Gomez or Paloma Faith. Like those acts, this album has an unmistakable European club vibe, but bolsters that sound with an intensely American feel. But where Gomez channels blues and Faith contemporizes club jazz, Florence uses a much wider swath of American sound. Almost no sound (except country) goes untapped.  Additionally, my honey points out a certain similarity to Bjork. Like the Icelandic Golden Throat, Florence creates an intricate soundscape that equally rewards fans for frenzied dancing and more restrained thoughts about the lyrics. In fact, I would consider Florence more successful than Bjork, because her dissonances are more subtle, sneaking past your defenses and surprising you with sudden insight.  If I had to find one fault, I'd say that I wish every single song didn't have to reach for the stars. Pretty much every track is an elaborate showstopper that tries to rock your socks off. Sadly, this leaves you with little opportunity to catch your breath, and the songs start to blend together. Just one or two slower-paced tracks could have taken this album from merely exceptional and into the ranks of near-perfection.  In a pop landscape where nearly every hitmaker sounds exactly the same as every other, Florence Welch taps others' songbooks while still sounding uniquely herself. Her lush songs, many of which conceal brutal themes in excitingly danceable tunes, reward multiple listenings. I wish more acts of this caliber came out of the major labels today. And I'm thankful I found this one when I did.
B004EPZ06Q|2.0|Movie is pretty good. Reused some jokes from first one that made them less funny. Ultraviolet sucks. I will never use it.  I use audials tunebite 9. Let's me legally store DVDs on all my devices, copy them, and convert formats as I want for my own home use.
0062073486|4.0|I won't go into the premise of the novel, as so many have already done so.<br /><br />I've delayed reading this one for many years...perhaps because it didn't feature one of Christie's familiar detectives and perhaps because the premise was too unsettling. How or why was one to invest in a story where you can be virtually sure everyone dies and the murderer is never caught? Now that I have read it, I'm sad I cheated myself so long. Somehow there's such atmosphere to it...just a rich, awful suspense that gradually creeps up on you as the plot develops. It was wholly unsettling. It's not that the characters were particularly sympathetic; they weren't, given that the murderer had them all pretty well pegged. But there's something naked and human about anyone looking inevitable death in the face, and especially facing perhaps violent murder. I had to have a black chuckle or two at some of the irony, too.<br /><br />There are a few distinct implausibilities, and somehow it seemed a tinge too easy for the murderer, like these people were just a bunch of sheep that could be cut off one by one from the others and destroyed at will. It was almost as if the murderer were omnipotent. (Given who the murderer is, the insight into people makes some sense but I kept on expecting the characters to do something the murderer didn't anticipate or somehow throw a wrench into the murderer's plans.) One of the things I've appreciated about Christie is how her mysteries were always complicated by real life...unfortunate coincidences the murderer or detective has to cope with, secondary and even tertiary agendas that obscured the truth, even sometimes the murderer's own preconceptions and biases.<br /><br />And yet, I was soon engrossed in the book and any flaws seem pretty minor. My overall impression is of a tightly plotted and even devilishly tricky plot, but something seems to transcend that. What of each of these characters?

B000QCS8TW|4.0|I finally got fed up with fan boys claiming this is the best series to ever grace the earth EVEN AFTER the last installment(s), and wanted to make a note for new readers to the Song of Fire & Ice saga.  This book get's a solid 4 1/2 stars.  The series as a whole after five installments, 2 stars.<br /><br />Basically, be prepared to enjoy the first half (Books 1-3), and wear a straight jacket for the remainder (Books 4-5).<br /><br />This 1st installment is a great book and definitely leaves you wanting more.  While certainly not Tolkien quality as some have claimed (admitting they are different writers with different approaches), GRRM continually brings a wonderful new angle into this genre.  No reason to repeat all of the positive reviews on this site (regarding any of the F&I books) since anyone looking through can get a feel for the positives... and (in the end) ultimate negatives regarding this series.  And here is where new readers need to research, what is being said about books 4 & 5 BEFORE they start diving in!<br /><br />To the point: Books 4 & 5... rubbish.  Waste of time.  It was extremely painful getting through four, but I kept promising the fifth (and initially / supposedly planned as the LAST) of the series would make it all worth while as well as reach a climatic conclusion.  Nope.  Five was worse.  Goes NO where, ties ZERO loose ends, kills any mental stimulation regarding all of the previously enjoyed characters, etc etc etc meh.  And now we must wait for installment six... SEVEN as rumors now claim?  I kept wondering if George Lucas had somehow gotten involved and starting adding his input on how to draw out BS sequences and potentially kill a series.  Can anyone say Robert Jordan?<br /><br />Now, as time continues to pass, there are worries that GRRM may never even finish this series due to his making readers wait nearly 8 years for the latest installment of nothingness (and over TEN years for certain favorite characters to even have a mention).  And if he were to \\"rush\\" the next book due to his new TV endeavor, many fear it would understandably fall short.  And rush he may have to... because where the heck is the TV series going to go once they reach the fourth installment?  Nobody would continue watching.  And applause to GRRM for getting the TV series in motion, nothing wrong with notoriety and building upon one's passion... however fears of where it can possibly go does remain.<br /><br />My advice if you are looking to read this epic... WAIT until (or if) this series of novels concludes and decide what people have to say about it then. If people rave about the conclusion, GREAT!  I will explain exactly as I have here.  Starts fantastic.  Dies, burns, & infuriates in the middle.  Concludes with ...well, we will see.book due to his new TV endeavor, many fear it would understandably fall short.

B002ZG981E|3.0|Ordered the Blu-ray on Black Friday as \\"new\\" from Amazon, not a third-party, and what I received was a copy of the movie with an expired digital copy. Beware if you expect to get the digital copy along with the movie.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|The subject matter is phenomenal and thought provoking.  As far as Herzog's documentary is was not as good as his \\"Encounters\\" film, in fact I felt it was a little dumbed down.  I still rate as a 5, giving more weight to the importance of the contents.  Humans everywhere should view this film as it demonstrates that our intellect may not have changed as dramatically over the past 30,000 years as one might think.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed with the bonus features on the dvd as there was only one - nothing more than Herzog fiddling with a hand-held camera taking videos of soundtrack musicians practicing.  I would have loved to learn more about thought/feelings that went into the music composition and perhaps hear more of Herzog philosophizing.  This documentary fell short in terms of bonus content when compared to the \\"Encounters\\" disk.<br /><br />This was my second time viewing the film, the first was at a crowded theater in NYC.  I felt I got more watching the documentary at home, particularly with subtitles on.  Even for me it was difficult at times understanding English with strong French accents.
B00288KNJU|5.0|I don't have kids so I never saw a reason to have a collection of movies for younger viewers. We recently moved back home and all our friends have kids that range between 2 to 8. The first night we had our friends over, another friend (with no kids of her own) was playing the babysitter role and thought it would be a good idea to entertain the little ones with a showing of Dark Knight. This went over with the children about as well as you think it would. My purchase of, A Nightmare Before Christmas, led to the recommendation of this movie. It was cheap so I picked it up. The next gathering we had, over the weekend of Halloween, the kids picked this movie over Disney favorites such as The Lion King, Bambi, and Sleeping Beauty. They wanted a spooky flick in accordance with Halloween and this one provided just the right level. As far as the actual movie, I don't know much. I would watch for a few mintues while checking on the kids, the pictures looked great on 1080p and it sounded good. I liked the parts that I watched and I will finish the entire movie one day. It's kid approved, good enough for me.

B004WCTLNY|5.0|The Adjustment Bureau is one of my favorite movies of the last few years. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt play perfectly off of each other while the sci-fi plot tosses enough compassion and endearment in to keep cynicism in check. It's the kind of movie I relish, in no small part because I'm a gigantic sucker for the magical power of true love.<br /><br />Furthermore, I love this movie because it is the kind of movie that reminds me of the great movies from the 30s and 40s - optimistic movies that take the world we live in and people we can relate to and put them in situations that reveal their strong sense of truth and the goodness in humanity as well as their unfailing belief in love.<br /><br />I admit that it's way too easy to knock The Adjustment Bureau for being heavy-handed and hokey, and it is without a doubt. But thanks to genuine and endearing performances by Blunt, Damon, and Anthony Mackie as the bureau member with a conscience, the movie manages to sink its hook deep inside my heart and take me along for a thrilling and glorious ride.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|This was my very first Led Zeppelin Lp record. I purchased it in 1975, four years after it's release. I consider it to be not only their best album, but the best Rock & Roll album by any band. And I'm saying this even though my favorite band of all time is The Beatles. Even though 'Revolver' was voted the best Rock & Roll album of the 20th Century, I feel that Led Zeppelin IV deserves that spot. It's not 'timeless' per say, but it does reflect the time in which it was created. I'm surprised it's the least expensive mp3 download on Amazon. This is the one recording by any group that I feel is flawless.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This movie is SO touching and inspirational!! It has a great story line and come out but the great thing about it is that the whole movie actually happened to a real person. I think that that point really made the movie a whole lot more dynamic than if it had been a 'made up' movie. This is a GREAT movie for all ages and everybody will want to see it again and again. To sum up this movie in one phrase I would have to go with \\" LIFE CHANGING\\".
B005EXA8LY|5.0|Much has been said about the music, which I love as well. I'll focus on the sound quality of the BluRay edition.  This disc is my new reference for audio quality in my dedicated multichannel audio room. The lossless high-definition audio caries the full impact of the wide dynamic range of Steve's compositions. The density of mixes in some of the tracks are clearly layered and arranged across all channels, with every last note coming through clearly. The 5.1 mix is the best way to hear *everything* in this magnificent album.  By feeding your processor the Dolby TrueHD bitstream, you will have the cleanest and most accurate reproduction path and spot-on time alignment (assuming your processor is well setup).  Playing this album on a great system reveals the magic that Steve performs on his mixes, with soundscapes coming from both inside and outside the circle of speakers. I'm constantly amazed by the new details I hear every time I listen to this masterpiece.  Highly recommend to anyone with a first-class multichannel setup, this album will reveal things you probably didn't know your system could do.
B005JU5JTI|5.0|I am surprised this movie only has 2 stars. I found it funny. It has the same kinda feel as Bad Santa which I also found very entertaining and funny. Too say the acting is bad is completely far fetched all the actors did a great job and brought their characters to life. I (probably not among favorable opinion) have to say this movie was far better than the over hyped and not so funny Bridesmaids which I found to be dull.
B005IZLPKQ|2.0|The damage that Marvel has wreaked on the multiplex continues with this visually arresting but ineptly executed clunker.<br /><br />The two leads, Chris Evans and Hayley Atwell, look good in uniform but are woefully devoid of charisma.  Casting directors, just because an alleged actor or actress has a nice body, it doesn't mean he or she can carry a movie, even a special effects extravaganza like this one!<br /><br />Only the ever resourceful Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci make much of an impression here, and that would be -- look what good actors will do for a paycheck...<br /><br />The director Joe Johnston must take a large part of the blame for the lack of suspense here.  I liked his \\"Wolfman\\" and \\"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\\", but this film must take its place among his growing list of misses.<br /><br />Really, American film makers are going to have to find more worthy sources of inspiration than Comicon -- or the mortgages on their McMansions.<br /><br />Finally this DVD appears to be devoid of any extras, but in this case that's probably not an issue.  I did wonder, however, how CGI managed to make such a transformation in Evans' body from 90-pound weakling to hulk.  I am guessing the color green played a role.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This is an excellent series to watch. The story is compelling, The fighting is well done, and the women are beautiful. This is definately a show for adults not for children. Lots of nudity and gore. If your into that then this is a must. Only downside is that it is short, only two seasons.
1451648537|2.0|This is not a biography but rather a story of Isaacson's super hero comic book character, Steve Jobs. The book reads like an a priori piece, feeding you conclusions before you get a chance to discover who this great man was. Isaacson quickly builds up toolkit of descriptions which he then plugs into equations that generates plot. The toolkit includes:   - eccentric education  - attention to craftsmanship  - love of art  - relationship with drugs  - ruthless impudence   - reality distortion field  From page 137, an example of Isaccson's equation at work:  \\"'Well, weve got to finish it,' Steve Capps said. And so they did. Once again, Jobss reality distortion field pushed them to do what they had thought impossible. On Friday Randy Wig- ginton brought in a huge bag of chocolate-covered espresso beans for the final three all- nighters. When Jobs arrived at work at 8:30 a.m. that Monday, he found Hertzfeld sprawled nearly comatose on the couch. \\"  People get hired, people get fired, Jobs has girlfriends, gets married, has a best friend, has children, runs 2.5 companies, rebuilds Apple, and puts a dent in the universe with insanely great products.  All of this feels 50 miles away, detached, un-opinionated, and frankly cliche. Isaccson gets away with all of this because, to most readers, the events in this book are fascinating on their own.    I highly recommend reading iWoz to get a better picture.
B005OSUL9I|5.0|This disc goes up to the top of the list in the collection here.  I've always admired Anna Netrebko but here she raises the bar even more.  The singing frequently brought tears to my eyes, and it was not just the lovely Netrebko, the beautiful Elina Garanca is equally appealing in this Blu Ray and is capably backed up by D'arcangelo and others.  The chorus work, orchestral accompaniment, the period costuming, .... Excuse me for raving but it had me transfixed.  Netrebko has put on a little weight so is not quite as super slim as previously but, if anything, it has added a mellowness to her voice without losing any of the power of a great soprano.  Her acting is utterly convincing.<br /><br />If you love opera and the female voice in particular, you are guaranteed an enthralling experience.  And the music itself, completely new to me, is a revelation in the best company that anything offered by Verdi or Puccini. Add in a plot based on history, and you end up with a great package.<br /><br />I cannot commend this operatic performance too highly.  You MUST add it to your collection.
B004SBBDB2|4.0|I have iPad 2, iOS 5.1, newest version.  Almost all the time I use \\"AVplayer\\" to play videos.   After all the tv plugs are plugged, plug to iPad2,   and then I need to setup 'wide screen mode off' in iPad 2.  Setting -> General -> TV out -> turn off \\"Wide Screen\\"  and then play AVplayer, touch/click tv icon. Enjoy.  My tv is Pananasonic TH-42PX50U, I used Component 2 plug in.

B003TJR2HS|1.0|I own four Honda accords; each one has an apple 30 pin pass through cable for the factory radio that charges and plays 12v iPod's through factory radio/cd aux.  The cable in the cars now will play iPhone's itunes but will not charge due to the 12v vs. 5v needed to charge.  The dockStubz says that it converts the 12v to 5v but it did not work on any of my Honda's.  It did allow the iTunes to work, which already worked with cables in cars now.  I returned 4 dockstubz back to Amazon.

0670022950|4.0|How does this sound for entertainment: Your date asks you out to the theater to watch a live cat slowly lowered into a fire and burned to death, howling with pain as it is singed, roasted, and finally carbonized?<br /><br />If that isn't your idea of entertainment, don't hop into the next time machine heading back to medieval Europe.<br /><br />In 16th-century Paris, throngs - including kings and queens -- flocked to watch such gruesome spectacles, shrieking with laughter as cats and other animals were tortured to death on stage.<br /><br />Torture and violence were woven into the fabric of life, from the sexualized sadism of London, where elaborately designed and decorated torture devices were the pinnacle of artistic creativity, to the widespread practice of hacking off the nose of anyone who spited you (the source of the strange idiom, \\"to cut off your nose to spite your face\\").<br /><br />In contrast, whether we know it or not, we are now enjoying the most peaceful period in all of human history. Indeed, the precipitous decline in violence of all types may be \\"the most significant and least appreciated development in the history of our species,\\" argues Steven Pinker, a renowned professor of psychology at Harvard University, in an epic tome, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.<br /><br />Given the tenor of the daily news headlines, Pinker knows his claim sounds far-fetched. But in 800 pages of research and analysis, augmented by hundreds of charts and tables, he convincingly establishes that violence is indeed heading in one direction: down.<br /><br />The decline is drastic across-the-board, in both state-sanctioned and individual violence: International wars, civil wars, terrorism (an obsession far out of proportion to its prevalence), slavery, sexual violence, child abuse, infanticide.<br /><br />Key to the decline, Pinker argues, is the diminishing currency of both tribalism and faith-based dogma, with its belief that suffering will be rewarded in the after-life and its press to defend unverifiable tenets with violence.<br /><br />Our ancestors were a \\"morally retarded\\" bunch, he argues, who couldn't see past their own noses - that is, if they still had them - to consider the perspectives of others.<br /><br />A combination of scientific rationality, literacy, mobility, urbanization, and technology has enabled humankind to become more self-reflective and to feel sympathy for others - from racial and ethnic minorities to women to homosexuals to children and even to animals.<br /><br />In his zeal to share his glad tidings, Pinker has an annoying habit of glossing over current problems. He pays scant attention to the United States's current practice of endless war, or the escalating costs of military engagement. He claims that the political disenfranchisement of African Americans has been remedied, ignoring the fact that millions of Black men in America are systematically denied the right to vote due to felony convictions. Similarly, he trivializes antigay violence, relying on FBI data that drastically underestimates its prevalence. It's hard to be too thrilled when inner-city children are still sleeping in bathtubs to avoid being killed by stray bullets. At times, he seems overly enamored of his own brilliance, rambling on and becoming repetitious.<br /><br />Still, the central theme is crucially important. Despite all of the world's problems, the dramatic decline of violence, notes Pinker, \\"is an accomplishment we can savor, and an impetus to cherish the forces of civilization and enlightenment that made it possible.\\"enets with violence.

No horror here, just great storytelling and memorable characters in King's memorable and easy-to-read voice.  If you like King, you'll love this book. If you don't particularly like King because of his darker books, I'd suggest giving this one a try.
B003Y5HWJU|2.0|I haven't and won't buy this series.  It is so exciting, I fall asleep every week watching it.  I'm not sure whether it's the slow story pace, lousy story lines, or what, but it just can't keep my interest.  If you have seen it and enjoyed it, by all means buy it.  If you are buying it because you heard it was a great series, or you like mob series, like the Sopranos, you will be very disappointed, I believe.

B002S9DRA6|1.0|To be honest I don't know for whom this compilation was released. Definitely not for fans as: 1) disc one doesn't contain all singles, 2) disc two is a compilation of remixes but surely not the best ones and surely not the ones fans would like to hear. 3) disc 3 contains very poor quality leftovers from last album and truly it's hard to say that is something fan would like to hear.<br /><br />I am very, very disappointed with this release. Enigma never was and never will be a radio friendly band/project. If there is someone who wants to get some kind of the best of Enigma then LSD compilation from the beginning of 2000s is much better choice as contains really the best songs, not specifically released as a single.<br /><br />Being a fan in the past (who admires The Cross of Changes and Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!) if I really need to get another compilation, I would like to have album containing ALL single versions of the songs on one disc and very special and rare remixes on another disc. Bonus disc with demo version of debut album or demo versions of most famous songs would be super addition.<br /><br />But instead of that we have received very poor compilation that will land for years on the shelf. Highly NOT recommended. I suggest you better get  [[ASIN:B00005OMTT Enigma - Love Sensuality Devotion: The Greatest Hits]] which is very special kind of the best of and contains real gems.
061891868X|5.0|[[ASIN:061891868X  I only recently began reading the book but I was quickly impressed with the clarity and depth of Smolin's writing. The physics discussed in the long introduction and chapter one was impressively accurate and clear. I'm a physicist of the older generation and not a trained in particle physics although I do know the major results of the standard theory and so I benefit from his discussion and appreciate being further educated. For years I have wondered what has happened to string physics and was not impressed by the apparent paucity of its results. Doing very advanced math is useless if results are meager and seem unlikely to get better. It's too bad since there are many fruitful areas to study and put resources into.

0061928356|2.0|As a mother of three internationally adopted children, as well as being an adoptee myself, I picked up this book thinking that I would identify with the characters and the story. Given the demands on my time, I have to choose my books carefully. Unfortunately, reading this book was a waste of my time. In theory, the book was based on a good premise, although the execution was poor at best. The text read as though it were a pre-teen novel with absolutely no character development. As the reader begins to ever-so-slightly identify with the characters, the chapters abruptly end and skip forward many years, losing not only the stream of thought, but also the potential empathy. Each character was so hollow and flat that is was almost unbelievable. For example, a doctor who marries an Indian and adopted an Indian baby yet is afraid and obstinate about going to India. In addition, the significant events that define their marriage are laughable. For a doctor and adoptive mother who should have presumably been more culturally aware, Somer was unbelievably simple-minded with little depth, as was both her husband and child. Her character is not remotely like-able or believable in any fashion. Furthermore, the actual trials and tribulations of adoptive parents weren't considered, while in contrast such silly, minor events caused stress in their marriage. The supposedly intelligent adopted daughter's thought processes and insights about her adoption and journey later in the book were so watered down that you couldn't feel sympathetic to her cause.  I continued reading, hoping that the book would improve. The more that I read, however, the more I realized that the author did not understand nor could she articulate her subject matter. The author's weak attempt to create a story about an adoption through the eyes of a mother and daughter fell woefully short.

0385534639|5.0|\\"The Night Circus\\" is easily the best book of 2011, possibly the best novel I've read since \\"The Time Traveler's Wife,\\" whose author provided a glowing blurb for this book. It is a magical, hynoptic, romantic and tragic read that will end leaving you feeling satiated and yet wanting more all at the same time. The reader begins the book in a similar fashion as the two protagonists do their competition: with limited information and no idea of where future events will lead. The book takes the reader on a fantastic journey with likeable characters that you are sorry to say good-bye to by the end. I'm hoping for a sequel!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'll cut straight to the point..I'd  heard about Stepen King and seen a few of his stories that made it to the big screen. But I was not attracted to what I perceived as his genre (horror), so I'd not read a single one. (May have to reconsider that now!)  When I read the description of \\"11/22/63\\" I was hooked.  I read it completely in about 3 \\"sittings\\".  It had everything that I love in a good book...first, a great story  and second, well painted (told). This story grabbed me from the first page and didn't let me go 'til the the very end.  It had an subtle underlying tension (for lack of a better description)that kept pulling me along in the story.   I was a senior in high school on 11/22/63 , so I remember things and attitudes portrayed. Time Travel for me.  So if you love a great story and a well told story...this  is a must read.

B002PQ7JQK|4.0|What a blessing that Gary Hutzel investigated the original \\"Trouble with Tribbles\\" stock negative to evaluate whether it could be used for this particular DEEP SPACE NINE time travel Tribbles episode several years ago. Remastered from the original negatives we have been able to re-experience the original series with a clarity and richness in textures and detail first on DVD, in HD and with Blu-ray the experience is equally breathtaking, one has the overall impression that the scenes with Bill Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and colleagues were not shot forty years ago but just the day before yesterday.  However, just as with other classic titles remastered in HD, the ultimate high definition experience is limited to \\"straight to camera\\" material. Combined with other film material (e.g. footage of USS Enterprise model + footage of starfield background, bridge main console + viewscreen) the subsequent result of the two is a copy that inevitably lacks the detail of each original. And seemingly the original SPFX footage elements (USS Enterprise in front of a bluescreen)- unlike the original ILM SPFX footage of ST-TNG we will be able to see in January 2012 with this market demand Blu-ray test disc sampler - were no longer available.  Thus, the original STAR TREK SPFX scenes are rather soft and seem out-of-focus compared to the scenes shot straight on stage or on location. One can only hope that the original, separate SPFX elements can still be located and properly restored.  Why? Because frankly, I didn't find most CGI shots made for TOS to be that convincing either in HD, especially stern views of the USS Enterprise: The strange surface gloss and illumination of Kirk's starship in a variety of shots clearly reveals it (and other vessels) to be CGI, the same applies for the Galileo shuttlecraft (the CGI version now takes off like an X-wing-fighter in special-edition-style, which makes you wonder why they need a space consuming runway and hangar deck in the first place).  If the original SPFX shots seem too static and boring in retrospect, the new CGI shots are often erratic and hectic and definitely more DS9 than in sync with the original context and series. I think the director's edition of the first motion picture is a better example how to 'upgrade' classic material for new audiences.   Some of the digitally added new elements are definitely great (like the moving starfield behind Kirk and Lenore Karidian in \\"The Conscience of the King\\", new matte paintings enhancing the previously 'limited' surroundings), but some are rather unnecessary and distracting. I hope this is not the last and final 'word' on the original series.

B006BQI1V2|5.0|Loved the movie, wonderful representation of the book. Read Sarah's Key yesterday and watched it after. Always feel like book will be better than movie, but it the movie was a wonderful compliment to the book. Breaks your heart, but a part of the history of France you do not often hear about...
B004EPYZPS|2.0|I went to see this movie the first week it was out with high hopes. Being a huge fan of lost i was excited to see this since JJ Abrams produced it.<br />The beginning of the movie is decent, but as soon as the stupid aliens show up it was ruined. The actors were below average. Why make a big name, big budget movie have little 10 years as the lead actors? I would have liked to see the dad have a bigger role(the guy in friday night lights). He was the biggest star of the movie and he was only in a few scenes. I went with my uncle to see this and hes a huge movie buff and he fell asleep it was so boring!<br />This movie was like Battle:Los Angeles. Suppose to be a huge hit but fails in almost all areas.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I bought these turtle beach headphones for my best friends birthday. These turtle beach headphones have been amazing sound quality Is fantastic. He absolutely love them. Another great part of these headphones there great headphones amazing sound quality. There very durable and the range of the warless signal is very good. The only negative thing I have to say is if you are planing on using these around your Internet modem forget it. If you are using your wifi signal these headphones signal strength is so strong they will kick you off of the wifi signal. But if you move the modem further away that will no longer be a problem. All in all I'm impressed with the headphones and they came in the mail withen days. 5 stars for me
B0000640SB|5.0|This is one of the best sci-fi movies, one of the best comedies and all round one of the most enjoyable films as far as I am concerned. The idea behind the film is clever, the dialog is crisp and witty, there is great use of film techniques, the acting is first-class and the movie doesn't waste a second. It's got more action packed into 98 minutes than you'll find in most 2 1/2 hour movies AND their sequels combined.<br /><br />Worth watching over and over again to see all the throw-away pieces of business, funny asides and topical references layered into the main body of the film. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are wonderfully well cast and Linda Fiorentino delivers her lines with such great timing and conviction that it takes a couple of viewings to realise how good at comedy she is.<br /><br />Not to be missed.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I will begin by saying that the transfer for these movies is absolutely gorgeous. This blu-ray set is on of the marquee examples of HD home entertainment. What can be said about these movies that hasn't already been said? A promising first movie, an action heavy second movie, and an anti-climatic third movie. But, herein lies the beauty of these movies: every time I watch them, it's like I'm unfolding a new layer. While I was disappointed with Reloaded and Revolutions when they first came out, as I revisit them I am beginning to appreciate what the Wachowski Brothers created. Sure, they may not be as refreshing as the first movie, but viewed as a whole they weave a story that is both compelling and gripping at the same time. It's the story of a savior beginning to understand his powers, then sacrificing himself for his people. It is true that these movies will probably not reach the same status as other trilogies like Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings, but I believe that these movies truly define a generation. This set does the series justice. In it you will find all 3 movies plus the Animatrix in full gorgeous HD, a slew of special features exploring the philosophical implications of these movies, and a slew of documentaries exploring the production of all three movies. Definitely a set worth owning, and a series worth revisiting.

0141018828|5.0|I didn't buy the book here on amazon.com, but in a local mortar and brick store.  The author was an emperor of Roman Empire who obtained the knowledge and wisdom mainly from the Greece (Stoicism).  The concept on the Nature, Reason and the Providence shares a lot of similarity of the Tao, which originates from China.  Moreover, the determinism, the self abstinence and service to society, all of these can find the equivalent in Taoism.  After reading the book, I got answers for many questions.  Absolutely you have the right to disagree.  Persuading you is not my purpose.  Do all human beings share the same God?  Yes.  Did God give all human beings the same wisdom?  Yes.  Are there universal things regarded as virtue to all human beings?  Yes.  They are  Love, forgiveness, Peace, Service to others...  Did the east and the west divert later?  No, but human beings in different societies emphasize different aspects.  Should people fight for their beliefs?  No, it's against the basic universal virtue: love, forgiveness, and peace.

B0002EXH5O|4.0|5 stars for the content and 3 for the re-mastering.  As for the original work, suffice to say it's a staggering expression of the form, metal at the edge of human achievement, Megadeth finally in actualization of this perfect marriage of impossible technique and decimating power.  Notables would include \\"Holy Wars\\", \\"Five Magics\\" and \\"Tornado of Souls\\", all propelled by a relentless rhythm section and embellished by Friedman's exotic lead work.    As for the remastering, well, the drums are the first noticeable difference.  Boomier and less natural sounding to these ears, the intro on \\"Hangar 18\\" almost sounding like a drum machine.  Vocals are further up in the mix and when \\"Take No Prisoners\\" rolls around, it's obvious they were redone, along with those on \\"Five Magics.\\"  Not awful, but certainly different.  And let's face it, you don't listen to Megadeth for the vocals anyway, so it seems rather unnecessary, unless the originals were indeed lost as was reported.  Thankfully, nmost of the guitar work sounds untouched, save for the intro on \\"Five Magics\\" and maybe the main riff on \\"Poison Was the Cure.\\"    Certainly the added tracks make this is a must for Megadeth enthusiasts, but it's recommended new listeners seek out the original recording, Mustaine feeling it necessary to tweak what was a fine production to begin with.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|one word for this book- \\"wow!' I have never wrote a review, but i believe this series is worthy of one, although it is a young adult series I thought it was great, and def recommend this book to anyone and everyone who will listen! Read this and ENJOY! it's so diffrent and has your attention from the beginning which i think is important
B000001DYA|5.0|There had been many metal songs and surf was a huge factor in it's style to what metal was to become. hard blues was the true root even but this was perhaps the first true metal release. (DIckie peterson(bass, vocals) denied this to his dying day , of cancer in 2009 at age 63, rip) but few metal scholars would disagree that this one was a whole cd of metal, the name didn't exist even yet.  But like I said metal and heavy garage had been around in songs but not in a full album till this one. This is all hard and blasting and aggressive. THe band was like all metal bands capable of pretty songs too and such but at this point they were a eeruption of things to come. WHich is why this one had a top twenty hit and the record went to number 11.  They did move on to psych rock which is metal in a way too. I  have this one and it's the shape of things to come in some ways , but it's not as structured as later metal. Still it's a classic and at the time it's amazing that this went so high on the charts.  The later stuff is good and more standard rock perhaps , but this is a must have for early metal fans.
0553801473|2.0|I was blown away by the first few books, amazed with the scope, pleased or disgusted by the characters in turn, but the last two books I found to be slower and slower and not a little annoying in the way that chapters were pulled out of book four to make book five.<br /><br />Do us and yourself a favor George...trim the fat, move the story along and give us more of what you're great at and stop with the run on lukewarm extremely fragmented glop that this has become.<br /><br />My recommendation to those looking to buy...don't bother until the series has been completed.

B002SSUQFG|1.0|Funny I thought it was a sport watch. I own this watch for 8 months and it add 10 seconds for every minute it make. It good to show it off but it's impractical for a real world use like sports. (Like how long do I run between point a to point b.) Second the bands on the watch are got to go because, if I ware them too long, the straps smells. I wash it with soap and water and it still smells. Personally, Unless you're collector who don't use it for sport,  I'm not recommend it. Swatch watch, automatic, I own once lasted about 8 years. I recommend to find a better watch for your sport need. Sorry Seiko 5, it didn't live up to my expectation.
141935972X|5.0|Once again Diana Gabaldon has outdone herself. The smooth transition from present to past, the excellant description of what life and sailing the high seas was like in those days and the way she puts into words the colors, heat, humidity that make you feel like you actually are in the middle of the Indies.  The intrigue and excitement continue with the re-introduction of one we thought dead and the way Claire and Jamie seem to always find each other and work and think as one all draw me back again for each new adventure.
B004LR5K0I|2.0|Walk A Mile In My Shoes: The Essential 70's Masters includes 120 of Elvis Presley's 1970's songs. However only 11 of these songs are truly outstanding. Outstanding songs include The Wonder Of You, Burning Love, It's A Matter Of Time, Separate Ways, I Washed My Hands In Muddy Water, Whole Lot-ta Shakin' Going On, Tomorrow Never Comes, Make the World Go Away, Funny How Time Slips Away, Merry Christmas Baby, and You Asked Me To. In addition, there are four other notable songs, which I will name in this review. The Elvis Presley of the 1950's and 1960's was the King of rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and slow romantic ballads. However, the Elvis Presley of the 1970's is a different singer ; he is an artist that sings mostly popular songs first recorded by others, country western music, and heavily orchestrated live performances. Almost completely gone is the rock and roll Elvis; all that remains are Burning Love and Whole Lot-ta Shakin' Going On. Almost completely gone is the rhythm and blues Elvis; all that remains are I Washed My Hands In Muddy Water and Merry Christmas Baby. Almost completely gone is the slow romantic ballads Elvis; all that remains is the beautiful The Wonder Of You. The Elvis of the 1970's interprets other artists material; examples include James Taylor's Steamroller Blues, Bob Dylan's Don't Think Twice It's All Right, Eddy Arnold's Make The World Go Away, Frank Sinatra's My Way, and Waylon Jennings' You Asked Me To. The Elvis of the 1970's rarely records in the studio. He either refuses studio recording or abruptly cancels scheduled studio sessions at the very last moment. The Elvis of The 1970's performs live in concert, where the accoustics and live recording equipment make Elvis' live performances clearly inferior to songs that are recorded in the studio. As a result, even a beautiful song like The Impossible Dream would have sounded so much better if Elvis had recorded it in the studio. Compared to Elvis Presley's 1950's and 1960's songs, Walk A Mile in My Shoes; The Essential 70's material is a huge disappointment: 105 of the 120 songs are not even notable! Eighty-seven percent of the music found on Essential 70's Masters is either poor or only  satisfactory and seems to drift by without exciting or captivating the listener. I fairly award the music found on the Essential 70's Masters a three star rating. The Elvis Presley of the 1970's was not the King of any type of popular music! Ten years of making mostly mundane movies, serious and escalating prescription drug abuse, Priscilla's divorce, aimless living, and regular concert touring took a very heavy toll upon the musical achievements of the 1970's Elvis Presley. Fortunately for me, I am a devoted fan of Elvis' outstanding music, a serious collector of 87 of  Elvis Presley's cds, and I already own copies of the 11 outstanding songs that are found on Essential 70's Masters. Walk A Mile In My Shoes: Essential 70's Masters is entirely expendable for the serious collector of Elvis Presley's music! I am going to sell these five cds. This sale tells me that I already own enough of Elvis Presley's music to fully appreciate his musical legacy. The packaging of this five cd set is the worst cd packaging that I have ever encountered! All five cds are jammed into a small box in a way that made it extremely difficult to remove the five cds without bending or cracking them. The box does not protect the five cds, so one has to use one's own cd cases to store them. I award the packaging of this five cd set a one star rating. Taking into account both the music and the packaging, I award Walk A Mile In My Shoes: Essential 70's Masters a two star rating. If you are a serious collector of Elvis Presley's music, I strongly recommend that you NOT PURCHASE Walk A Mile In My Shoes: Essential 70's Masters.  John
B004WCTLNY|1.0|THE HIDDEN MESSAGE IN THE PLOT  You must understand this first! There are two stories of creation in Genesis. One is given of men created in the plural sense,and the second the creation of a secret place called Eden with only one man called Adam to begin with.<br /><br />Simply put, after Cain slays Abel, God removes them from Eden to stop them from further access to the \\"fruit of the two trees\\" with a flaming sworded angel guarding the path.<br /><br />Cain married a woman and founded an entire city given his long lifespan, which God began to reduce in humanity at various intervals of time, as stated in the bible.<br /><br />These sons and women of men, were hybrids, for lack of a better term,  derived from some of the \\"ancient aliens\\". The ones we are finding out about more and more today, thru archeology, ruins and ancient transcripts translations found across all nations and ancient civilizations. Ones who worshipped their own alien gods.<br /><br />These are the people that called on God for salvation and refuge, see Isaiah 63-65, and vowed to set aside their alien gods in exchange for life and protection thru God. Especially Isaiah 63:19 We have long being like those whom you do not rule, like those not called by your name.<br /><br />These are the men that existed outside of paradise in times given like 2 Esdras 10:45. 3000 years of time before ANY OFFERING was offered in it.<br /><br />Now as end times approach, we realize how far we are straying from the path of our salvation and redemption as defined in narrow terms by God. Example, our soul, the soul of man rationalizes the \\"common sense\\" of same sex unions and argues the right to even use the biblical name and ritual blessings of marriage, a concept defined and given to us by God in exchange for His protection and His way.<br /><br />(Note: I am not judging these people, I know some wonderful people, it's just I HAVE NO RIGHT TO JUDGE GOD by teaching my children its acceptable to redefine God's parameters of marriage to suit our mortal human liking.) Civil union is man made and excellent for contractual and legal reasons, it suits it's purpose. Marriage is God defined and it's ritual is for those who obey God's definitions.<br /><br />If you have read all of 2 Esdras, then you will understand  the angel Uriel explanation of the three parts within us, the soul of man, the spirit, and in the middle is the mind which is the visual interpreter. The mind is the holographic dream machine, the trickster, or the inner eye that enables the spirit within us to grow and change. (2 Esdras 5:22).<br /><br />Angel Uriel explains we have to earn our spiritual passage to leave earth and join God in His new world. This lifetime of mortality is a CONTEST for our soul of man to grow because it is limited (2Esdras 4), and we must enlarge our spirit through understanding first,  and this understanding comes thru the mind which acts as interpreter.<br />2Esdras 7:14 ..unless the living pass thru the difficult and futile experiences, they can never receive those things that have been reserved for them.<br />2Esdras 7:50 For this reason the Most High has made not one world but two.<br />2Esdras 7 57 127 this is the significance of the contest that all who are born on earth shall wage.<br /><br />This movie theme explores the concept of DIVINE INTERVENTION thru 'ANGELS' - not helpful ones but forceful men in black suits who like biblical angels also admit they do not know God's plan in it's entirety.<br /><br />It's disgusting in that it also ARGUES:<br /><br />1) the SOUL OF MAN is forced to accept divine intervention. (The strange office scene with mind altering wands)<br />2) Exploiting the concept of undying love, the soul of man is entitled free will to redefine eternal happiness, and that if only we try hard enough God will relent in giving us an eternal Earth where we can incorporate our own chosen version of eternal happiness.<br /><br />Take note there is also only ONE suited angel who decides to help man force God to change His plan.<br /><br />Yet God has already given this freedom, and in Isaiah 65:17 God creates a new heaven and earth Reserved for those who accepted His challenge of spiritual growth and reform in the mortal Life of flesh,  and in Isaiah 66:24 agrees the soul of man shall continue, their worm shall not die. It's just those who did not want to accept His enlightenment will not be relocated to His new heaven and earth.<br /><br />The freedom of choice was always... and has always been ours. It's just we must know that this earth will be destroyed, the sun and the moon humbled, read 2 Esdras and Revelations. And As the Spirit never dies, and we must choose in what world we would like our spirit to pursue in.<br /><br />2Esdras 7:21 The Lord strictly commanded those who came into the world when they came, what they should do to live, and what they should observe to avoid punishment.<br /><br />For those of us who have forgotten this instruction during our 'flight/journey' over into this earth to be born mortal (who has not dreamt of an exciting airplane ride full of anticipation) and once here we can CHOOSE to be reminded of God's word by the brave few who attempt to act as ambassadors for God.<br /><br />This movie is reprehensible for trying to trick ignorant people into believing God is forceful and only concerned  with reforming us to His liking regardless of our hearts desire. That God will relent into incorporating our desires if only we demand it. And lastly to sympathize and side with the one dark lonely angel who will help give man what his heart desires.<br /><br />Quite shocking, but no more shocking than some of our dreams can be as the trickster of our mind attempts to offer persuasion and bring enlightenment or even confusion.and earth Reserved for those who accepted His challenge of spiritual growth and reform in the mortal Life of flesh,  and in Isaiah 66:24 agrees the soul of man shall continue, their worm shall not die.

0062060554|4.0|I purchased this book on a whim because I thought that the premise sounded interesting and there reviews were fairly positive.   I enjoyed reading it, however it was kind of slow in the middle.  It's also possible that I enjoyed the book more than others because I'm in the field of psychology and I find matters of the brain fascinating. However; you do not need to be in psych to like this book! I don't mean to discourage anyone from reading it.   If you can get it from a friend or on sale- to do. This isn't a must-have book for my collection.
0061969656|3.0|This is my first Cornwell book. As much as I enjoyed it, I'm sure it won't be my last.  At first I thought his opening, \\"Every day is ordinary, until it isn't,\\" was hokey. And the smaltzy dialogue of the first couple pages made me wonder if I really wanted to continue. Fortunately I did. This is carefully plotted and the characters are mostly quite believable. There is a pair of twins that almost make me cringe, but the plot moves quickly enough and there are enough clever little twists to keep me very entertained.  The immediacy of first person narration was a good idea. It also lets the author off the hook for complete historical accuracy. Hey, even history books have enough inaccuracies to sometimes qualify as fiction. The narrator, though, is cocky and arrogant, proud of his paganism, and still likable.   What I liked most about this book is the attention given to details regarding setting, action and realistic human motivations. Cornwell makes the scene come alive for the reader as if he has been describing events in real time.  There were a couple things I didn't like. One is that the antagonists have no real presence in this book. They're the Danes, of course, but they're always at a distance and never up close with faces we can visualize. They lack depth.  Our hero always thinks faster than anyone around him. Since there's seemingly nothing he can't do, he seems unrealistically invincible. His antipathy to Christianity wears thin after a while and it goes beyond mere characterization and doesn't contribute to the plot since (in the first half of the book, at least) it becomes quite heavy handed. The same goes for the monks who \\"sing like little birdies\\"--meant as caricature? What's the point?  Ultimately, I was left with the impression that Cornwell is a natural storyteller with a very keen eye for detail and invention, but here he probably got a little careless in places.  One thing I'd prefer to see here is a much more detailed map of England.

B000AGTPUK|5.0|Are you looking for a holiday movie that is uplifting? Strap your seats in and enjoy this ride to self-discovery for several children in this fantasy.<br /><br />No film is perfect. One problem with this one is that the story is not feature film length. So there are a lot of exciting scenes of the train/children on roller coaster tracks that are enjoyable and breath-taking but do not contribute to the story. By the end, it seemed a little too much. But not enough to take away from the story.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is excellent in the several roles he takes during the movie. The special effects live up to their name. And I like it when special effects are a thing of beauty as they are here, as opposed to being used for ugliness as they are in horror movies.<br /><br />I will always say this. I don't believe children should watch movies or TV without the accompaniment of their parents, regardless of the rating. This allows the parents to be in the habit of knowing what their children are watching and provide opportunities to take advantage of teachable moments. But this is definitely family fare.<br /><br />Let me close with comments from my particular world-view, which is Christian. One plus side is that it shows belief as an important source of joy in a person's life, as any Christian can testify. Two dangers. 1) Is the emphasis having faith rather than the object of faith? 2) Is faith seen as independent of reality/reason? There are other things that might make some Christians uncomfortable -- it almost seems Santa's being worshipped by the elves.<br /><br />The caveats I mention should not keep you from enjoying this excellent fantasy.

0811870413|5.0|A great book for the serious bread baker!   Like others, I spotted Tartine Bread in a kitchen store and was intrigued by the beautiful cover. I have always wanted to make delicious sourdough bread. The book looked like a complicated read, and for the beginning cook it might be a bit hard to navigate. However, when I purchased the book I made a personal committment to put in the time to learn to bake REALLY good bread.   I read the instructions multiple times in order to fully comprehend them. I bought all the equipment Chad suggested. I spent three weeks nursing the starter; smelling it and looking at its behavior. When I felt I had everything in place, I made the leaven in the evening before baking. When it \\"floated\\" the next morning I actually cried with joy! Throughout the \\"baking\\" day I read and reread the directions at each step. The end result was two loaves of the most delicious sourdough bread I have ever tasted. The loaves look beautiful (very close to the way they appear on the book cover), and the texture inside is delightfully complex and slightly chewy while the crust is crackling crunchy. You cannot buy anything like this in a supermarket or even at most bakeries!

B005M68S4W|2.0|For the sake of balance and perspective, I'm giving this a lowly two stars.  It may possibly be worth three, but surely not the uncritical five automatically awarded by most of Mr Bennett's slavishly loyal fans.  First up, most of the heavy lifting on this album is done by the guests, not by Mr Bennett.  k.d. lang, Josh Groban, Norah Jones, Faith Hill and Mariah Carey are especially good, so much so that one sometimes regrets the strained intrusions of their aged host and mentor.  Even on the less-successful pairings it's hard to entirely dismiss the notion that Mr Bennett is somewhat creepily leeching on the fresh, nubile talents of his partners in order that he may continue to haunt our nights a little longer.  Which is why I've come to think of these as The Vampire Duets.  He also loses at least one star because so many of these songs simply do not lend themselves to a duet.  What, pray tell, is going on with \\"The Girl I Love\\", the decidedly muddle-headed duet with Sheryl Crow?  It also has to be said that the visual image conjured by Carrie Underwood crooning \\"It Had To Be You\\" to the (great?)grandfatherly Bennett is more than a little uncomfortable.  Ditto Faith Hill marvelling at him in \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\".  Finally, the Taste Police must surely requisition a star for the shameless over-production on most tracks, the phoney showbiz banter that would have us believe that Tony and John/Willie/Josh/et al are BFFs, and the sheer cheesiness of Bennett and Lady Gaga on \\"The Lady Is A Tramp\\".  If Ethel Merman and Mary Martin came back to life and sang a duet on Letterman like they did back in the 60s you'd surely be struck by the incongruity.  For all their greatness, it would seem hokey and embarrassing in the 21st century.  Which is exactly how I feel about Bennett and Gaga romping through \\"The Lady Is A Tramp\\" as though there is some common ground in there somewhere, either lyrically or artistically.  It's a bit like watching your grandfather dirty dance with a wild teenager, who thinks it's hilarious to respond by sticking her tongue in his ear.  You can chuckle and say \\"There's life in the old boy yet\\".  But you know it's wrong.
B000KI6286|5.0|Nine times out of ten, when I read a book before seeing the movie, I enjoy the book much more; but the movie \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" (TYFS) is that rare occurrence of a movie which is the equal of the book.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book TYFS, which I still rate as one of Christopher Buckley's best.  In movie form TYFS is even more impactful, due to the stronger sensory experience of the cinema, while being equally funny and insightful - but not, of course, as pleasingly long or in-depth.  What makes TYFS succeed so brilliantly is Buckley's satirical behind-the-scenes view of how Washington politics and politicians work, and what they say, feel and do, both in public and behind closed doors (which, of course, is quite a contrast).  Although certain scenes in TYFS are a bit over-the-top, and one might quibble with certain things the characters say and do, one gets the sense that there is a lot more truth about our political system in TYFS than there is in today's 6 o'clock evening news.  Movie writer/director Jason Reitman faithfully transfers Buckley's views to the silver screen, and the production values of TYFS are top-notch.  Aaron Eckhart us simply amazing as lead character Nick Naylor: he is perfectly cast as the handsome, well-spoken lead lobbyist for the tobacco industry, and he gives a great performance.  The supporting cast also turns in a series of fine performances: notable are Katie Holmes as an unscrupulous investigative reporter, Maria Bello as a fellow lobbyist (for the alcoholic beverages industry), Robert Duvall as the patriarch of the tobacco industry, and Sam Elliott as the original Marlboro Man.  The settings and cinematography are outstanding, and the producers even got Joan Lunden and Dennis Miller for a couple of talk show scenes.  Any quibbles about the movie aren't worth mentioning, aside from the fact that the movie is definitely for adults, even though there's nothing explicit about the visual images.  So if you are someone who takes a skeptical, perhaps cynical, view of the goings-on in Washington D.C., and would enjoy laughing at how you suspect Washington really works, then you will thoroughly enjoy \\"Thank You For Smoking\\".
B00005N6KG|3.0|When I bought these, I was under the impression that they had ear buds on the tips. Not so. These have a hard round tip with the speakers facing forward and they have an odd fit in my ears. You can hear well enough and they are very light, but I can't imagine why they would want to design these this way.
B005GVA2L0|4.0|This is the first album I have purchased by Evanescence.  I have always enjoyed the past albums I have heard from them but when I heard this album when it was streaming online I had to pick this one up.  This is a very good album to purchase for any Evanescence fan or anyone who wants to give it a try.  Evanescence continues to keep their sound but bring forth  \\"What You Want\\" was an excellent choice for a first single that displays a more up-tempo sound than what they have delivered in the past.  I completely agree with another reviewer on how the beginning of the song \\"Sick\\" shares a resemblance of \\"Forty-six & 2\\" by Tool as I thought the same thing instantly.  This song is another gem that would be a great future single.  It's actually difficult to find any song I dislike from the album because I find myself not wanting to skip any tracks.  You have your share of the more up-tempo numbers like \\"What You Want\\", \\"Erase This\\", and \\"Never Go back\\", the mid-tempo rockers such as \\"Sick\\" and \\"Change\\", and the ballads such as the epic \\"Lost In Paradise\\" and the experimental \\"Swimming Home\\".  If you're thinking about purchasing this album, then I suggest you pick up the deluxe edition.  The song \\"New Way To Bleed\\" opens up with chanting from Amy that reminds me of a Lacuna Coil-type melody that I noticed right from the start.  There are also the up-tempo numbers of \\"Say You Will\\" and \\"Disappear\\", the latter being possibly my favorite track on the album.  The closer \\"Secret Door\\" is a softer number that somewhat captures the sound of \\"Lacrymosa\\" from The Open Door only softer.  While reading other reviews, I can't help but wonder how some feel like all the songs sound the same.  Were you looking for more ballads?  If you have the deluxe edition, then you have four of them at least (including \\"My Heart Is Broken\\" which is more of an up-tempo ballad).  I find each song on this album is unique in it's own way.  The only resemblance I noticed were the choruses of \\"My Heart IsBroken\\" and \\"End Of A Dream\\" have somewhat the same structure but that's about it.  Maybe those reviewers were looking for an album similar to the experimental sounds of The Open Door.  But to conclude this review, the only cons to this album I find is the lack of a choir that appeared on such past songs such as \\"Everybody's Fool\\" or \\"Lacrymosa\\".  A second con is that this album doesn't capture the eerieness of past songs such as \\"Snow White Queen\\" that kind of sparks more of a gothic feeling to their songs.  However, Evanescence still continues to achieve their sound including Amy's capivating vocals, the hard rocking musicianship, the piano, the strings, etc...  If you are one of those individuals who found lost with Evanescence due to feeling that their previous effort The Open Door was underwhelming compared to their stellar release Fallen, then give this album a listen.  I think you'll be pleased.

We watched this awesome movie and we were very inspired by the unity and strength of the Hamilton family..   We have movie night, and this was one of the movies our children wanted to view.. We were so happy and inspired by the message this movies delivers. The scene where Bethany inspires the community to go back into the water was so touching to me.. I myself would have been scared.. But God does not give us the spirit of fear, but a spirit of power, love and a sound mind..   This movie Blessed our spirits and household.. I love the spirit of the movie, I love how no matter what negative statements were made, the family never let that get them down or bring them apart.. Many families fall apart when tragedy strikes. I am so glad that this movie showed the strength of family, faith, unity, and love..   If you have not viewed this movie, you are missing out! Purchase this as soon as you can, you will want to add this to your movie collection..   Be inspired... then inspire.....

1594202842|4.0|I couldn't help but feel sympathy for Amy Chua after I finished this book. It's rather well written, although disturbing on many levels. It's not that I have major objections about her child-rearing philosophy (I do). It's just that the book shows a highly intelligent, successful woman who is also beset by a profound identity crisis, deep-seeded insecurity and an almost pathological belief of stereotypes, despite her prominent protestations to the contrary.  Chua begins her book with a disclaimer - she is only \\"loosely\\" using the terms \\"Western parent\\" and \\"Chinese parent.\\" She acknowledges that strict parents come from all ethnicities and nationalities. Politically correct platitudes out of the way, for the rest of the book she is right back stereotyping in her binary world: East vs. West; Orient vs. Occident; her parenting philosophy against everybody else's (including her: father, mother, husband, and mother-in-law, it seems). At certain points her daughters and husband point out this cognitive fallacy to her, but it never seems to occur to her that it might be true. She is, after all, a woman hellbent on a mission - to single-handedly stave off the vanguard of impending familial decline represented by her daughters' generation.  What's that, you say? What impending familial decline? Therein lies the fuel that stokes Chua's furnace - a fanatical, possibly pathological trust of stereotypes and trusims. Like a religious fanatic convinced Armageddon is on its way, Chua believes the truism that the grandchildren of immigrants (i.e. her daughters) are destined to lead a slow slide into oblivion. The irony is that the objective likelihood of this decline is all but remote. Among her many accomplishments Chua can boast dual undergraduate/graduate degrees from Harvard; tenure at one of the foremost law schools in the country (Yale); and published author. In addition, she has a sister with a PhD, MD (read: VERY smart doctor) from - where else - Harvard; and is married toanother law faculty member at Yale who was in his younger years an aspiring actor at Juilliard. Hardly the hallmarks of a family pedigree circling the drain.  Chua's actions have the behavioral hallmarks of a person backed into a corner. Placing large bets on music to \\"save\\" her family, her daughters are heavily immersed in the world of classical music performance, with Chua bankrolling extravagant sums on instruments and teachers. Her sacrifices are not just financial, but physical and emotional. Chua scolds, pleads, cajoles and bribes her children into practicing their instruments well into the night while working out the nearly impossible logistics of directly supervising her children's many hours of practice with her career and running a household. These efforts bear fruit when one of her daughters ends up playing in Carnegie Hall.  But that's the problem. Chua's pursuit of objective evidence that she has somehow staved her family's decline is Sisyphean. Her daughters' accomplishments are never enough to allay her worries, and she is quick to interpret even the slightest hint of rebellion (or what she would term \\"non-Chinese behavior\\") from her daughters as a sign of failure. In short, doubt and insecurity pervade her being.  Despite the criticism that Chua's strong-armed parenting style has garnered, it extends from the lack of a cohesive sense of self. Despite outwardly self-identifying as a Asian-American and arriving in the US as an infant, she seems to identify more closely with her Chinese roots. With her inveterate belief in her family's the eventual decline, she fears that her family's Chinese roots will be extinguished with her. This explains her overly aggressive Chinese \\"Tiger\\" parenting method (even shocking her parents) as well as the foisting of an unwanted Chinese identity on her children (who like most American-born children of immigrants likely identify as American).  Luckily for Chua, her daughters are unlikely to end up in psychotherapy. Admittedly, as Chua states children are more resilient than \\"Western parents\\" assume. They are, also, unlikely to end up heralding a decline in her family's fortunes - although this has less to do with her parenting style than who she is. It is more than ironic that Chua felt the \\"Chinese way\\" was the only way to ensure success for her children, while being married to a Jewish man whose upbringing was markedly different culturally/religiously/etc. Despite these differences in upbringing, both grew to become scholars at Yale. This suggests that it's not so much the parenting style, but rather the example that each parent sets and who that parent is. Children of high-flyers will likely become high-flyers themselves, even when left to their own devices - because children emulate those around them. There may be periods of rebellion the road, but these are character-building, if anything. Micromanaged parenting driven by a pathological fear of failure, as in Chua's case, may produce successes but it also runs the risk of producing uncreative, passive automatons.   The devout Amish are comfortable releasing their adolescents into the world to experience all sorts of risk taking and rebellion (rumspringe). Yet a majority of Amish return to the fold; we might all learn from this, take a step back and let our children figure out what is best for them.

B000PC6A3E|5.0|First of all, \\"Batman Begins\\" is one of my all-time favorite movies. But I am not planning to review the movie itself since you can find it in Imdb or many other places.  It comes in a nice slim box and a packaging which is pretty straightforward to open. There is only disc which contains the movie + all the extras. I haven't watched the extras yet, so can't comment on that. Will update my review once I do. I would give 5/5 to both audio and video quality of the movie itself and I absolutely love it every time I watch it.
B004ZN9OTG|4.0|i bought this hoping to find some improvement, or change to the sound of this album.  It doesn't seem very different to to me than the earlier version I have of it.  I think there's more bass, which this album didn't really need.  So if you're sitting on the fence as to whether you should buy this remaster, I'd say save your money, because there isn't much of an increase in sound quality.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I love this video series!  The quality is excellent and I enjoy seeing the additional scenes which were cut for television.  I haven't watched the movies yet, they must be at the end of the set.  It's nice to see the story in  order instead of mixed up reruns on tv.  I would recommend this product to anyone who was or was not a fan of the show.
B004X60QE2|5.0|Eureka is different. After Farscape and Stargate went off the air, I thought I'd never find a great scifi series. And then Syfy (then Scifi) picked up Eureka. What a refreshing show. It took the usual scifi/fantasy genre and made it fun and funny, not always serious and this series has no problems making fun of itself. It's completely irreverent and I love it. Word to the wise: Syfy has since canceled this series so the upcoming season (summer 2012) will be Eureka's last. The only good thing about this? Is that I can purchase the series on blu-ray when they get the complete series out.
B0026KX4HS|5.0|One of the few movies that I can watch over and over again.  Vincent D'Onofrio is great as the \\"bug\\".
B005M2A4D4|4.0|The series is great--give stars, but I buy the dvds for the extras and the subtitles--since I often can't understand the British slang.  But these subtitles are not always complete and sometimes incorrectly transcribed.  Can't the BBC give the scripts to the people doing the subtitling?
B003Y5H5AQ|3.0|First, let me say that I enjoyed the movie. I have been a fan since the Hanna-Barbera cartoon from the eighties.  This is a cute and enjoyable movie, even with the occasional low brow humor and over-indulgent slapstick that channels old Hollywood physical comedy.  No the story isn't overly complex, but it does dabble in backstory that pays attention to the canon from Saturday morning cartoons a la Hanna-Barbera without going into too much depth.  It's enjoyable for all ages, whether kids or kids-at-heart who want to be nostalgic or just entertained.  The cast was a good fit, even if Hank Azaria was subject to brutally obvious Wile E. Coyote moments in the story.<br />Now the downside: Even though I won't rant with a verbal tantrum that some of the others have already posted, I will say that I share their disappointment about my purchase of a more-expensive 3D Blu-ray version of this film, to find out that doesn't include all the extra features like \\"The Smurfs - A Christmas Carol\\". This one item in particular is a substantial omission from the 3D combo pack, and apparently it's not available through iTunes as of this date. It's also disappointing that the digital copy included is not an iTunes compatible format.<br />I do not like the new Ultraviolet streaming format for various reasons that others here have already (rather irately) mentioned, as well as one particular reason of my own. When we, the consumers, purchase something that includes a digital copy, we do expect to be able to use it with our portable devices without the over-complications of creating multiple new accounts to access it, and to receive low quality streaming that the new Ultraviolet Digital Version seems to impose.  My main issue with the service is that when I download Ultraviolet Digital Copy instead of streaming it, I haven't been able to find a selection in the software that allows me to choose where to store the file.  This is a major inconvenience when you are using a computer that only has a 256GB hard drive like the Macbook Air, and when you use a network storage device such as Time Capsule or WD Sharespace on your home network to store audio/video digital media. It also means that (so far) it will not play on an Apple TV.  I understand the right of the manufacturer to produce their own digital copy format, but that doesn't mean it is the format that consumers want, or want to pay for in lieu of important special features that are included with less expensive editions.  I definitely don't want to purchase two copies of the Blu-Ray combo packs to get everything that is typically included in all of them, including the 3D version.  My suggestion is that the industry pick a standard for digital copies just like they did when they all caved and went with Blu-Ray, and also select a standard on content inclusion/exclusion so that consumers aren't disgruntled or disappointed.256GB hard drive like the Macbook Air, and when you use a network storage device such as Time Capsule or WD Sharespace on your home network to store audio/video digital media.

0060936223|2.0|The parts concerning her family and her decision to move to NY to pursue art are beautifully rendered. Then she meets Robert Mapplethorpe, and the narrative runs off the rails.<br /><br />Relentless name-dropping, pointless anecdotes (except to drop a name), nonsequiturs (she talks about her interest in the Koran, but drops it, doesn't attach it to anything), lack of insight into herself (new heights in codependence) and Robert (Robert's a user and they are both relentless social climbers), obvious self-censorship/omissions, and other things that strain credulity (she found an empty purse with money in it right when she needed it: um, yeah.) The writing, after the initial section, was pedestrian, as many other reviewers have said. Lots of telling, very little showing, humorless. The result is a deeply sentimental and frustrating book to read.<br /><br />OK, starving artists, tortured artists ... I get she loved Robert Mapplethorpe and that's great for her and him. But he comes across as a self-aggrandizing user, not to mention perpetually adolescent and grandiose. \\"It's genius, isn't it?\\" he says referring to one of his own pictures. Um-ok. His artistry always seems about him, to make a name for himself, to reflect glory on himself, and he never breaks through that.<br /><br />There's also real lack of insight into the artistic dreams they were pursuing, a question of identity, specifically, walking a well-trodden path, living a cliche (it's practically paint-by-numbers, going to all the right places and meeting all the right people), and never really breaking free of it. Her favorite, Rimbaud, got it and moved on a century earlier. If she did get it, and she may have, but she didn't mention it. It's a big hole in the story.<br /><br />Am I sorry I read it? No, it has great material to work with and thought-provoking. But it's a very flawed book, and don't mistake it for real writing. It's not. It's lazy writing, and obviously so. The National Book Award referees discredit themselves with this choice.

B004UXUUDA|4.0|I read the novel, [[ASIN:0312370830 Sarah's Key]], back in the summer of 2009, and rated it 5 stars. I thought this movie adaptation was very faithful to the book and, though quite sad, I did enjoy it very much. It touches on an aspect of the Holocaust that I was previously unaware of, and set me off on an exploration of other literature that dealt with this subject. The film stars do a fine job of portraying the characters, and the cinematography and dramatization of the setting, past and present, bring the utter horror of this black mark on human history to light. Definitely, though, if you want a complete experience, read the book as well.<br /><br />This fictionalized account of the roundup and of the relationship of two families connected through an apartment on Rue de Saintonge in Paris is haunting and memorable. \\"On July 16 and 17, 1942, 13,152 Jews were arrested in Paris and the suburbs, deported and assassinated at Auschwitz.\\" Those Jews were drug from their homes in France by FRENCH police following orders given by the Nazis. On the day that she was rounded up by French police, 10-year-old Sarah Starzynski had locked her little 4-year-old brother, Michel, in a cabinet telling him that she would be back to let him out when the police let them come back home. The families of men, women and children (most between the ages of 2-12 and most BORN in France) were not allowed to return to their homes; instead they were taken to the V&eacute;lodrome d'Hiver and sequestered there in abominable conditions for days. Then they were separated by sex, husbands taken from wives and even worse -- mothers were torn from their children. These confused, hungry, and mistreated citizens were loaded on cattle trains and taken in convoys to the camps.<br /><br />The story shifts from past to present with chapter changes, moving between scenes of Sarah as she is imprisoned in Vel D'hiv to American born, now French citizen and journalist, Julia Jarmond Tezac who is assigned the story when that tragedy is to be memorialized on the 60th commemoration of the Vel' d'Hiv'. Julia soon discovers that the French are largely ignorant of this deplorable event and their embarrassment at knowing that this was done keeps them from remembering those lost families - and in fact, many French families simply took over the homes and possessions of the former Jewish occupants. Sarah's story affects Julia in ways she never imagined and completely alters her views of herself and her life. Julia becomes consumed with knowing what happened to Sarah and her family and begins a mission of discovery.<br /><br />What she learns provides a lesson and an admonishment for us all: Zakhor.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great app. Probably the slickest you'll find on the Kindle. If you use your Kindle Fire mainly for reading a lot of pdfs, as I do as an academic, this app is exactly what you need. It's fast and powerful.  The only improvement I can think of would be to make moving files between notes easier. If I upload a photo as a note, I'd like to be able to copy the image and add it to another note without having to get my laptop. Currently I cant seem to do this.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|Super 8 is a remarkably entertaining movie, especially for those of us who lived through the '70's, before working class became coterminous with working poor.  If you missed that decade, the ambience provided by the old steel mill town of Weirton, West Virginia may seem implausible and a bit hokey.<br /><br />The plot line is pretty simple, and I admit that it does invite comparison with another of Spielberg's films, namely the blockbuster hit E.T.  The parallels are not so close, however, as to legitimate the suspicion that<br />Spielberg is just stealing from his past successes and recycling old ideas.  After all, the kids in Super 8 are older, the action scenes are astonishing, viewers are treated to a really cleverly done instance of a film within a film, and we've even got romance.<br /><br />I have no idea where the kid actors came from, but they are very good.  Each in his or her own way is engaging and, for the most part, quite believable.  The kids are at their best when appearing in their own zombie-themed movie, so be sure to watch it along with the closing credits.  It's really interesting to see them portray kid actors making a kid movie -- stilted, stiff, and stammering -- after they've shown us that none of these afflictions of youth and inexperience hamper their performances in Super 8 proper.<br /><br />Glyn Turman does a fine job as Dr. Woodward.  (He's probably best known as the mayor of Baltimore in the HBO series The Wire, and fans of In Treatment will also recognize him.)  The rest of the adult cast is adequate, but it's the kids who steal the show.<br /><br />I first saw Super 8 in a theater and a year or so later on DVD.  I loved it both times.  It is, indeed, a lot of fun.
B005ORVMT2|4.0|Is anyone else's album jacket for All the World's a Stage slightly mauled? :-) I don't particularly like the way it was folded up. Maybe it has to do with the fact that it opens up into three sections instead of two, I don't know.
0061353248|4.0|Having majored in marketing, minored in economics and had the privilege of teaching both subjects at the college level I'm interested in research that helps to link both fields (i.e. economics and marketing).  Dan Ariley's book contains some insightful research and information that is of practical use to consumers, investors and business people.  I read it shortly after having finished George Akerloff and Robert Schiller's 2009 \\"Animal Spirits,\\" which is an excellent book that discusses the subject of behavioral economics from a more macroeconomic perspective.  I would have given Ariley's book a five rating, except for the research and information in Chapter 5 (The Influence of Arousal) which I found to be morally objectionable and in poor taste with little or no worth as research or practical information -- unless you consider the revelation that college-age males make worse decisions about sex, birth control and STD prevention after watching porn on a computer screen, with a plastic covered key board, to be particularly useful or enlightening \\"research.\\"  Chapter 1, \\"why everything is relative,\\" in addition to introducing the subject of behavioral economics, demonstrates how consumers can be influenced by advertising with product and price display to choose to buy things businesses want us to purchase.  It's closely related to  Chapter 2 on \\"the fallacy of supply and demand\\" which  emphasizes the extent to which demand can be created and manipulated by suppliers, and though it is a good point of emphasis from an economics perspective it is hardly a startling new revelation.  Vance Packard's 1957 Book \\"The Hidden Persuader's\\" may seem a bit dated, but no one since has done a better job in my opinion of describing in detail how marketers use psychology to manipulate and entice consumers to buy their products.  Even so from a consumers perspective it is valuable information to consider when evaluating purchase decisions (i.e. Do I really need or want to buy this, oram I being manipulated to want it by fad, fashion and advertising?)  Chapter 3 on \\"the cost of zero\\" offers a useful insight.  Some of the research though is questionable.  For example the conclusion that accepting a $10 coupon for free versus a $20 coupon for $7 is not optimal is in my view suspect in making unwarranted assumptions.  If I don't want to shop at the store offering the coupon for a discount and don't particularly value their merchandise at more than say 50 cents on the dollar, but will take $10 worth for free, then it's perfectly rational for me to accept the free $10 coupon without offering to pay $7 for a $20 coupon.  Also if I need my cash to buy groceries and gas, and we're talking about a clothing store or electronic outlet coupon, my decision in rejecting the coupon for cash deal is not at all \\"predictably irrational.\\"  Still from a consumer perspective Ariley does a good job of reminding us it's worth considering that a lot of the \\"free\\" stuff businesses offer us isn't worth the time or effort, and may cost us more than it's worth (e.g. especially if we get enticed to pay much more to use the \\"free\\" coupon or to buy a lot of stuff we don't really need).  Chapter 4 on \\"the cost of social norms\\" is really excellent and offers a fresh original view point that would be useful to those studying psychology, marketing, business management or economics.  The idea that there are business and personal circumstances in which paying people to do something may actually motivate them less than allowing them to do it for free is worthy and useful research.  Perhaps one lesson to be applied is that by developing better social relationships both in business and in personal settings we can learn to do a better job of helping others, and in return receive more help and assistance for ourselves in return.  Chapter 6 on \\"the problem of procrastination and self control\\" is a good reminder of the importance of improving our self-discipline and in learning the importance of setting key deadlines and milestones for ourselves and others in reaching our goals.  Another important application is putting a renewed emphasis on disciplining ourselves to save and invest for retirement, and not simply sitting back and hoping social security or a pension will be sufficient.  I somewhat disagree with Ariley (despite his experience to the contrary with student papers at MIT) however in suggesting we might need to put more controls over others to force them to avoid procrastination, even though from a business manger perspective I would say it might suggest the importance of supervisors monitoring deadlines and milestones with subordinates to assure projects stay on schedule.  Self discipline can be learned, and if we incentivize it, and people are held responsible for not meeting their own deadlines, it's a virtue that in my view can be revitalized in modern society.  Chapter 7 on \\"the high price of ownership and why we overvalue what we have\\" might be a good reminder to those who are keeping a lot of extra stuff around to sell it, give it away or trash it to improve their quality of life.  It might also help those looking to sell homes, cars or other items to set realistic prices so they can improve their chances of finding a buyer in a reasonable amount of time.  It might be a good reminder for investors to not hold on to stocks too long once their prospects for price appreciation have dimmed (i.e. don't hesitate to take some profits or cut losses ).  Chapter 8 on \\"keeping doors open\\" emphasizes the importance of making commitments early and also reinforces the lesson of chapter 6 in avoiding procrastination.  We may have lots of options and opportunities in life, but we have limited time and resources to pursue them.  So it's important to choose what is best for us and not to delay too long in making those choices.  Ariley emphasizes there are economic and social costs to such delay, and most of us would do well to heed his advice.  Chapter 9 on the \\"effect of expectations\\" and Chapter 10 on \\"the power of price\\" are very useful and closely related.  Often things such as placebos in medicine work because we expect them to help us, and we often find more enjoyment or relief from a product such as the higher priced pain reliever because we believe paying more gives us more benefit.  By examining those beliefs and doing some research ourselves, we might just be able to save some money by buying lower cost generic drugs, shopping at discount stores and finding lower cost substitutes that work as well or better.  It's worth asking ourselves do we really enjoy it that much more because we paid more for it, and is it really worth the extra price over lower cost alternatives for the benefit it provides?  Chapter 11 and Chapter 12 on \\"the context of our character\\" is also highly useful for understanding ourselves and others regarding our integrity in business and other economic relationships.  For one thing it explains why people are far less likely to steal petty cash from work, but don't mind pilfering office supplies or cheating on expense accounts.  I suggest reading it in conjunction with George Akerloff and Robert Schiller's 2009 Book \\"Animal Spirits\\" in it's discussion of \\"corruption\\" as an undesirable behavior influencing economic decision making, and the importance of keeping it under control in sustaining economic growth and national wealth.  Chapter 13 \\"Beef and Free Lunches\\" ends on a light and humorous note with a discussion of an experiment Ariley conducted at an off campus pub in posing as a waiter to serve drinks (often free) to customers to observe the degree to which their choices were influenced by the choices or suggestions of others.  The one lesson I'll take from it is to try and order first when I'm with a group in a restaurant so I get what I want and am not influenced by the choices of others.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|I have a 62\\" Sony TV. I could not believe the poor quality of the picture on this DVD. It looks like an old super 8 movie in some scenes. A am very disappointed. All the other DVD versions of the Harry Potter series look good except this one. How did they muck this up so bad? Is this DVD an actual Bootleg?  I saw the movie in the theater and this DVD does not do it justice. If I were a star in this film, I certainly would not be happy about the poor quality of the DVD either. It makes them look bad.
0446547654|1.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and many of his books.  But, this is by far his worst. I felt like I was reading some horrible remake of The Notebook, and actually could not believe this book was by the same author! It is very predictable and unrealistic, and at times, honestly disgusting. The use of ghosts is overdone. The ending was ridiculous.  I was so disappointed.  He needs to move beyond the type of book he has written so well before and find a new focus for his writing. I do not recommend this book - do not waste your time or money.  If you haven't read some of his other books - try The Notebook, Three Weeks with My Brother, or the Last Song. Any of his prior books are better than this one!
0385534639|4.0|Masterfully written, I felt like I was treated to a holiday in a magnificent circus myself as I read. Couldn't wait to disappear into the story again when I had to put it down. I love how it is written in present tense- and how each fragment of the story shown gradually builds the whole picture. Loved it!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Excelentes actuaciones. La imagen de Blue Ray permite un mejor disfrute de la calidad visual de la película, tomando en consideración los negros más negros.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|I've been eye-balling this box set for a while now. When the price dropped to $63, I had to get. Amazon is like the stock market, prices keep going up and down. Why? Who knows, but I'm glad I finally got this set. If you're a fan of early Genesis you'll enjoy it, but the remixing has it's plus and minuses. The clarity is superb. You'll hear things you've never heard before, that's a plus, Then again, sounds you're used to hearing will be mixed way down, that's the minus. Or is it? You'll never know until you get it.
B001U5V03U|3.0|The director, Francesca Zambello, is not working in top form here. She brings to her Royal Opera House DON GIOVANNI more than the rudiments of an interesting visual style, and she certainly shoulders some responsibility for thought about character and theme. But she draws from Simon Keenlyside one of the nastiest, most reptilian and charm-free Dons in my experience, surely her choice more than his, and balances the scales with the platitudes and bromides of a contemporary feminist. Over and over, her blocking emphasizes an idealized sisterhood which crosses class lines, with the three women achieving unity in their victimization and perseverance. A Virgin Mary icon literally watches over this trio of beauties as they bond in struggling against a male-dominated world of abusive brutes (Masetto), unrepentant lechers (Giovanni), and paternalistic patronizers (Ottavio, Commendatore). All three women join hands to wield one weapon against the Don at the close of Act I; Elvira and Zerlina console Anna during \\"Il mio tesoro\\"; \\"Mi tradi\\" is in part an Elvira suicide attempt prevented by the other two. Elvira appears  radiantly happy in the final scene when announcing her plan to spend the rest of her days in the convent. Of  *course* the Elvira of such a production would be happy about that prospect, both for what she is leaving behind and what she is heading toward: spiritually enlightened sisterhood forever.<br /><br />None of this is necessarily invalid, and dumber things have been done with this opera, but it is heavy-handed and anachronistic, and not realized with the subtlety and grace that might have gotten it over. Zambello's interest in the women comes at the expense of the men: the Giovanni and Masetto are just unpleasant, while the more genial Ottavio and Leporello seem undercharacterized, stock. Throughout the opera, parts that tend to play awkwardly even in good productions (the Don's slo-mo flight from Anna near the beginning, with Leporello chuntering away inthe corner) predictably do so here, but easy parts are also muffed (the Don/Commendatore duel; the Don's escape at the first act finale, here done with a rope in the manner of a rock climb; the first Don/Leporello confrontation with the statue, done without a statue). It is a half-baked, neither/nor GIOVANNI, showing the impulse of \\"It's been done so often one way, and I want to do something else\\" without that impulse carried through to a thorough, convincing \\"something else.\\"<br /><br />There are some excellent vocal performances, but that can be said for most DON GIOVANNI DVDs. Most successful are the mezzo Donna Elvira of Joyce DiDonato (a sympathetic and beautifully calibrated acting performance, allied to tight runs and an absolutely seamless voice) and the Leporello of Kyle Ketelsen (vocally wholly agreeable, and well drilled in the standard comedic Leporelloisms to the point of expertise -- but whether his performance has much to do with the production around him, or whether the director's imagination was seized by this character enough to really incorporate him, I am less sure). Also impressive is the Zerlina of Miah Persson, who gets all she can out of Zambello's very sexually liberated and sophisticated take on the peasant girl. The Don Ottavio, Ram&oacute;n Vargas, gives a characteristic performance: never an actor, but sincerely engaged and likable. He sings the part mellifluously, if not as well as he subsequently would in fall 2011 at the Met (another lackluster GIOVANNI, that one by Grandage). In New York, it seemed to me he had achieved the stature of mature artistry; in  London three years earlier, the long-breathed phrases in the middle of \\"Il mio tesoro\\" are a bit labored.<br /><br />If Vargas always seems to be Vargas rather than the character, his basic stage savvy is nevertheless put into sharp relief by the very green Masetto of Robert Gleadow. The latter has a nice voice, but his scenes are hampered by stiffness and diffidence, accompanied by furtive sidelong glances, surprising to encounter in a broadcast performance. No such concerns are raised by Marina Poplavskaya, who throws herself passionately into the production's very black-and-white, unambiguously virtuous and wronged Donna Anna (I did like the detail of the character's mourning veil). Poplavskaya's haunting timbre and compelling presence compensate for the shortish breath line and hit-or-miss fioritura. Zambello shrewdly has the Russian soprano let down her waist-length blond tresses as she prepares to navigate the rapids of the second half of \\"Non mi dir\\" -- the distraction is welcome. Eric Halfvarson is only a serviceable Commendatore. In the title role, Simon Keenlyside is in rough vocal estate, and portrays a facet of the character (brutality) with zeal and professionalism, while other possibilities are deliberately underexposed.<br /><br />I find the contribution of the conductor, the late Sir Charles Mackerras, a challenge to review. Speeds are on the fast side, attacks are aggressive, phrasing pushy; the period-style horns rasp away authentically, the timpanist clubs away with his hard sticks, and the overall sonority elicited is thin and watery. It is surely the performance Mackerras was trying to conjure up, it is academically defensible, and I am sure it is the way someone else likes music of this vintage to go. I found it a trial of the nerves, but my preference for the richer and sleeker sounds of, say, Riccardo Muti (especially on his second DVD, the one from Vienna), is a subjective one. What is more clearly problematic is the poor sound balance, every time to the detriment of the vocal soloists. I wondered how this came off in the house, and whether the octogenarian conductor was suffering a not-atypical decline in hearing acuity.<br /><br />Extra features are very good: a comprehensive behind-the-scenes video tour of the ROH hosted by Deborah Bull (not directly linked to this DON GIOVANNI; the Hytner DON CARLO was being prepared at the time), and five minutes each allotted for music director Antonio Pappano (whom I wish had conducted) to interrogate Mackerras and Zambello. Pappano's questions are better than the inane ones the Met's star singers typically pose to each other on Saturday afternoon movie broadcasts (e.g. \\"Is it difficult to go from tragedy to comedy?\\"), and Zambello is so thoughtful and poised that I wish I had enjoyed the product of her efforts more this time.

B005P06AAO|5.0|You do realize by \\"trash\\" I'm referring to Jersey Shore, right? I saw a preview for this show over the summer, and thought it looked like a pretty interesting premise. Especially coming from a network that seems to be more focused on reality then airing shows with actual substance. Watching just the pilot I instantly saw something special, and knew I'd be tuning in next week. Awkward offers something that a lot of comedies can't touch, and that's truth and razor sharp wit. People keep talking about New Girl, 2 Broke Girls, but honestly this show came out strong right out of the gate and Awkward has those two shows beat when it comes to consistent quality. It deserves a bigger audience, and MTV has finally got a good show on their hands. Don't mess it up!
B005R4255C|5.0|Love the show. Love the \\"soundtrack\\" of Cirque du Soleil's Michael Jackson's Immortal World Tour. It seems like most commenters here expect a remix/mash-up album to complete with Michael's original releases. That is never the intent of remix/mash-ups and this is no exception. They could never be better than the originals. Kevin Antunes did a great job on bringing Jackson's vocals forward so you can really hear them differently. Michael liked to use a lot of different sounds in his songs and Kevin Antunes highlights Michael's unique sounds and speeches. The CD is great and should be judged for what it is. It is true to the show but it is not in comparison to the original work of Michael Jackson. That would be blasphemous. Enjoy it for what it is....a soundtrack to a great show that brings Michael's music and messages to people to rediscover and enjoy. It is my hope that it will prompt people to buy Michael's original albums who don't already have them, especially his later work. Michael's amazing work didn't stop at Thriller and the world (and critics) need to be reiminded of that.
0545128285|3.0|I enjoyed reading the short tales in this book. They are amusing and contain themes that little ones could benefit from upon hearing. The trouble is I doubt most kids could comprehend the writing. I read it to some kids ages 10-11, and they were lost. I would say it is around 7th/8th grade reading level.
0316098329|4.0|This is a fascinating book; one I could not put down. The premise is interesting and I think the author did a marvelous job telling the entire story in a five year old's voice. While I had a problem with some of the situational dilemmas, most of the story really worked for me.<br /><br />In case you've been locked in a room yourself and missed all of the hype, this is the fictional tale of a woman abducted - held captive in a room for seven years - as seen through the eyes of her five-year-old son Jack who was born in the room. Emma Donoghue weaves an interesting tale.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Service was quick and accurate, and the price was fair, can't ask for more than that.  I am very happy with my product.  This series is the best I've come across.
1250004217|4.0|This is the WW II book I was hoping for when I read Julie Orringer's The Invisible Bridge earlier this year. Rosnay's story is of young Sarah, a Jewish girl born in Paris, who is included in a round-up of Jews by the French police in July of 1942. Her story is researched by an American reporter living in Paris who, coincidentally, has relatives living in the very apartment from which Sarah was removed.<br /><br />The author weaves the two stories - past and present - together very nicely, and puts a human face on the horror of the Holocaust while still offering a hopeful outcome.<br /><br />Well done! and, thanks to everyone who recommended it to me!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Intuitive design, aesthetically pleasing, and easily used.  &quot;Pro&quot; is right, everything you need for Word, Power Point, and Excel in one nice package.
0307477479|4.0|This book seems to have won every award possible known to man. It's a series of vignettes -  stories which could easily stand alone, but are strung together by differing characters. For a while, I amused myself trying to figure out which character would appear in the next chapter. It reminded me of a Picasso, or a Dali; there was a lot in here, a lot of stimuli.<br /><br />The writing is strong, almost too strong, to the point that I wondered if the author had a thesaurus beside her during the writing process. There were a lot of big words in here, or maybe just a lot of capacious colloquy.<br /><br />This was a fascinating piece of post-modernist writing. I'm just not sure how well I'll remember it in a year.
B004EPZ0BG|1.0|Characters were not realistic, the conversations between them were ridiculous.  Many scenes were crude and meant for cheap shock for laugh value.  If you like to see Justin's butt over and over then you will not be disappointed. The movie only made me chuckle softly once or twice.  Overall waste of my 1 hour and fifty minutes.
0812550706|4.0|I'm not much of a fan of the sci-fi genre, but this book was very entertaining.  It's the story of young Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, the third child created by the government as a child-genius, drafted to be a military leader, who suffers from loneliness, anger, and really misses his sister.  If you're looking to be entertained for a bit, this book will do it.

I will be implementing my travel checklist as a whay to mistake proof my packing for business trips.  The author also provides some key principles for developing a checklist and some insight into the barriers to implementation.  Having a useful tool doesn't necessarily mean that it will be widely implemented even if the results are evident.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I just have to say I was sad to see the Percy Jackson book series end. But if I could not put this book down YOU SHOULD buy it.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|I loved the original movies, but my imagination, and modern technology, conspired against me so much so that when I first heard that George was updating the originals with more added scenes, I thought, \\"Cool!  Gotta see that!\\".  I'm not a purist.  If adding something to something great makes something that is great even greater, I say...uh...great.  Anyway, I actually love all the CGI changes except two, and one of them I could live with...  The change I can live with: Han no longer shoots first-  I didn't really notice the first (and only) time I saw Star Wars: A New Hope in the theater that Han shot first, nor did I realize how important to his character development that scene was.  It was the audience's first encounter with this anti-hero who would soon become one of the most beloved heroes in movie history.  However, a lot of that development in who he was to become was firmly based on who he was to begin with.  So having Han shoot first was really an awesome way to tell the audience what a bad guy he originally was.  Sure, he shot another bad guy, and the other bad guy would have shot Han if Han hadn't shot first, but a bad guy who takes out another bad guy can still be a bad guy.  Right?  But to make the other bad guy just a bad shot, and to give the anti-hero enough of a heart to wait until his protagonist attempted to kill him before he took his shot was a pretty major, and disappointing, decision by Mr. Lucas.  But I could have lived with that.  The scene was short, sweet, and not enough to ruin the trilogy   (note: you may have noticed I didn't include the prequel trilogy as part of the series; I still hold out hope that someday in my lifetime a new and upcoming Star Wars fan and director with the same focus Lucas had in 1977 will re-make the prequels, and Jar-Jar with only be a humorous footnote in the margin of Star Wars history.  I hold out the same kind of hope for the Harry Potter movies, but that's another review, and a lot less traumatic).  The change I CANNOT live with: Little Annoying Annie replacing Papa Darth-  However, having said all that, the scene that ruined EVERYTHING Star Wars for me (except the Dark Knight and Legos video games) was digitally replacing Anakin \\"Big Bad Daddy\\" Skywalker, the man who used to be Darth Vader, one of the most infamous villains-turned-repentant-father in Hollywood lore, who's former visage could chill your bones just by turning his helmet towards the camera, with Anakin \\"Annie\\" Skywalker, the teenage whiner who was only mildly interesting to watch when he got really, really mad.  And even then he flailed his light saber around like a Kung-Fu wannabe while battling his better, Obi-Wan.  Meesa no unnastan da logik beehine dat disizhun!  Seriously, when I started watching the updated CGI'd \\"original\\" trilogy on DVD, I was digging the experience (\\"re-digging\\"?), and was so excited when at the end of Empire, I saw that Mr. Lucas had chosen to make the victory celebration more appropriately celebratory.  One of the few issues I had with the original was the wimpy musical number selected to end this epic experience. Imagine my horror (too strong a word?  I think not!), when, while emotionally engaged in the final scenes, our heroes and innocents happy, reunited, entire planets celebrating in a fashion appropriate to the occasion and scope, with space-high fireworks and various species-appropriate orchestral music, not just a bunch of paper mache koalas singing \\"Kum Bi Ya\\" in aboriginese, and I'm thinking, \\"Yeah!  Awesome!\\", the scene that carries the most weight and biggest pay-off arrives.  Obi-Wan, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker (Luke's FATHER.  Not his brother, not his cousin, not his roommate) appear as we last remember them: healthy but aged and wise.  But wait.  What?  Who's that kid where Daddy Darth should be standing, uh, floating?  It isn't Anakin Skywalker as we remember him, but as we've been trying to forget him: as the whiny, non-heroic, non-repentant, goofily-grinningTEENAGER, healthy yes, but aged?  Nuh-uh.  Wise?  Not even.  Not to put to fine a point on it, but not even in the right trilogy!!!  Put back the old guy Mr. Lucas should.  Since that terrible experience (I still mumble about it in my car on the way to and from work), I haven't even had the desire to go back to my DVDs, let alone buy them on Blu-Ray!.  (deep breath) Anyway, I think we all get where I'm coming from.  I digress.  Sorry, Mr, Lucas, but if you were to ever bump into me on the street, and then, out of the blue, were to ask me (and why wouldn't you?) what I thought you could do to get me to watch anything Star Wars EVER AGAIN, I would tell you, \\"Mr. Lucas...\\" (no reason to be disrespectful), I would say, \\"Mr. Lucas, in my humble opinion, your position in the sci-fi universe would be elevated from the current Emperor of the Imperial Army, back to Original Esteemed Jedi Master, by first of all returning Sebastian Shaw...\\" (the man who played Vader unmasked; don't be too impressed, \\"R. White\\" set me straight on this) \\"...to his proper place as the spirit of St. Anakin, and second by giving Han Solo back his anti-heroic dignity, and letting him shoot first.  That, good sir, would not only make me want to continue viewing your original trilogy in CGI, but I would then HAVE to buy the Blu-Ray version, because then, and only then, would STAR WARS IV, V & VI return to the top of my ten-best-movies-of-all-time list (at, coincidentally, positions IV, V and VI, only behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy)!!  Plus I would quit complaining to anyone who will listen about Anakin the Ghost-Child, and start gratefully recommending the original trilogy, on BluRay, to all my friends!!\\"  And no, just because Star Wars beats Star Trek, that does not make me a Star Wars fanatic.  There are other reasons...  So there you have it.  Just a casual fan, briefly (!) expressing his opinions about a movie series that was created 30 years ago.  No big deal.  Thanks for reading.

B00006EXCC|5.0|This is how it was recorded in the 60's.  No fancy remix making all the music \\"blend\\" and \\"segway\\" nicely, but when there are drums, they come in loud and clear and then go.  When there's a guitar riff, it comes across hard and clear and then is replaced with the Jagger's or Richards' voice when it goes back to vocals.  So nice to have a true version of what was cut back then.  The UK Version is also a bit more raw than the US version, I've been told, but I've not had a side-by-side comparison.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|These headphones are great and sound awesome. they are very comfortable and because they go around the ear sometimes hot in warm places. i kind of like the 10 ft long cable but it depends. the one thing that kind of bugs me is that if i plug them into my phone or ipad they are not extremely loud. even at max volume i dont think they are very loud. im hoping someone can give me an answer to this problem, if its an amp, which one in specific. but when i plug em in to the speakers in my computer, i am amazed at how loud they make em, they sound perfect. i was also kind of hoping they could block out sound, but sadly no. it makes up for it with the quality of the sound though.these headphones are good for most music, i havnt found music these headphones dont sound good in yet. but yea in all, the sound is amazing but not that loud by themselves, the cable dosnt bug me as much, they are very comfortable but sometimes warm,why do mine say made from china?,and i would recommend these headphones, they are cool, im not gonna lie these headphones leak sound alot but they are not bad. again if someone could help me with the volume issue.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Based on previous reviews I decided to download this book and I'm delighted I did. One of the best books I have read this year. I was completely engrossed from the first chapter and it only got better.  I hated for it to end. I can't wait  to read more from Ms. Swank. She is definitely a gifted author.  This book is a steal at .99 cents. Don't pass it up.

0321704452|3.0|When I first skimmed the syllabus for EGR 641 and saw the book title The Naked Presenter, I kind of chuckled at the thought of being naked while presenting. My first thought was that this was going to be a book discussing the humor behind presentations - perhaps a collection of stories making light of the oppressive and dreaded presentation utilizing slideware. I purchased the book and began to read; I was initially disappointed - I was looking forward to this humorous book I'd psyched myself up for. Anyway, I sat down on a Saturday and read the book cover to cover. Surprise - I came away feeling no longer disappointed, but more relieved that I now have a fantastic tool-book that perfectly complements and reinforces what I'm already learning in my Professional Communications class. While I really enjoyed Garr Reynolds' zen-like approach to delivering presentations, I also enjoyed the more cosmetic aspects of the book - the print quality, the layout, and the ease of the read. But, generally I left the read with one aspect of The Naked Presenter that resonated most with me: Allow your presence to manifest by engaging the audience in passion, proximity, and play.   I learned that you must properly engage your audience to become a great presenter. \\"When it comes to presentation delivery, the problem generally is not the display of too much emotion but rather the utter lack of it\\" (Reynolds 100).  According to Reynolds, the power of the smile - the sincere smile is infectious and contagious. This I also agreed with and have found to be true. Ensuring that you tap into your audience's emotions; utilize sincerity in smiling; interact in proximity; and encourage play via tone and facial expressions - these are all valuable lessons that Reynolds thankfully expands on.  The only criticism I have of the book is that there was no true exploration on the tricks and trades of slideware - or Reynolds' dissection of slideware tools he found to be most effective and why. Also he didn't share his tips or tricks of the trade with physical or technical trip-ups. (I think that the only trick he shares utilizes the B key for a black screen.). He does discuss the process of developing your presentations by brainstorming, sketching visuals, etc., but I would have liked to learn more about the products out there that get his stamp of approval for presenting.   However, The Naked Presenter, is a book that teaches you how to project yourself. After all - that's what a presentation is (a projection of you). Reading Reynolds' work teaches you that the power behind the presentation is not in your slides, but in the presenter. The presenter is the key to what message the audience comes away with. I highly recommend The Naked Presenter and am pleased with its principles. I plan to practice these principles right away beginning first with showing my jounetsu, passion.

B005N95JA4|3.0|lets see we have Miss You and Shattered with some so - so material in between. I wonder who writes the reviews for this website? The author states, \\"as good as exile..\\" though a \\"smidgen\\" more exiting...are you nuts? Anyway, record is worth getting for Miss You and Shattered. Now, about the second bonus CD. THIS is something I wanted! Stones stripped down and smokin. Fantastic!
B005GUQIDC|4.0|I just want to say that this is an artist to look forward to. The things she can do with her voice is amazing and it looks like she got good help with song writing as well. Songs are really intricate yet still catchy at first listen. My gripe with this album is its rather mundane and safe production. It sounds like a studio CD when her more \\"live\\" vocals are far more moving. Seriously, you haven't heard her until you go and watch her Sing Sing Studio videos. Go to youtube now and watch them, it may be the same song but the presentation is vastly different. Thank me later.  Favorite so far: Settle Down, Two Way Street, Call Me, Wandering Limbs.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Works great on kindle fire and boosts my productivity quite a bit. Notes are easy to manage. I've got access to notes across all my network connected devices. The tagging feature is very useful organization and quick searches. Evermore is awesome.

0525423281|5.0|My Thoughts: You might remember my gushing review Of Anna And The French Kiss last year. I loved that book so much. It was incredible so Lola had a lot to live up too. Would it live up to the expectations, would it be incredible? Would it just be ok?<br /><br />We are introduced to Lola Nolan. Come on, even that name is neat. She has a very unique style and is very creative. She lives with her two dads (this is a bit complicated story) and has lived in the same house forever. During the years a boy lived next door named Crickett. His sister is a famous skater so they move around a lot, coming back here and there. Rewind two years, and we find out Lola and Crickett liked each other, but nothing was ever done about it. They end on a bad note and don't talk for two years. Lola moves on to a new guy, Max. Max is 22 years old. Quite a bit older. He's also in a band and has tattoos.<br /><br />Lola is going on with her life when a moving van pulls up and it's none other than Crickett's family. Oh no, what is she going to do? Can she face the boy who broke her heart?<br /><br />As time goes on, Lola and Crickett connect again and get to know each other more and more. It's like he never left and she feels attracted to him for who he is.<br /><br />But of course there are obstacles in the way. The boyfriend Max, Crickett being away at college, her family, his family, of course there has to be problems separating them. I'm going to stop right there, I don't want to ruin one bit of the plot. I want you to experience the magic of Lola And The Boy Next Door all by yourself.<br /><br />And yes, there are some Etienne and Anna throughout the book. They are in it quite a bit actually which was kind of exciting.<br /><br />When I started Lola And The Boy Next Door, I knew I was going to enjoy it. There is just something magical about Perkin's writing style. She makes you feel alive. She makes you feel like you are really the girl who is in love with the boy. She makes your heart jump, she makes your heart ache. It was charming, cute, sweet, brain candy, and realistic.<br /><br />I loved Crickett. I loved how he made a bridge to connect their windows, I loved how he wore his pants tight, I loved the bracelets he wore and how he had to write everything down. I loved his love for his family. I loved how sweet he was.<br /><br />I loved Lola too. I loved her sense of style, I loved how you could tell she wanted to be strong, but sometimes it just got to her and she had to let it out. I loved how she would speak her mind most of the time, I loved the different wigs and clothes she wore. I loved how she was proud of it.<br /><br />Point blank, I loved Lola and the Boy Next Door. And this is the exact kind of book that makes me love YA. I adore Perkins. I adore Crickett and Etienne. How Perkins can create two totally different guys and make me fall in love with each of them the same is incredible.<br /><br />Lola And The Boy Next Door was everything I hoped it would be. I did like Anna And The French Kiss a tad more but I think that has to do with Anna going to Paris, and who wouldn't want to meet a hot french guy?<br /><br />Lola focuses more on having the boy you are meant to be with right in front of your eyes all your life. It has to do with romance, soul-mates, magic.<br /><br />The whole time I was reading Lola I was mesmerized. There is just this sweetness about it that makes me want to jump up and down, and smile, and laugh. And be happy.<br /><br />Overall: If you couldn't tell by now, I loved Lola! I want to go on a date with this book. A little extreme huh? Well, can I take Crickett on a date instead? Just for one night? Please Please Lola? If you haven't picked up Lola And The Boy Next Door, do it now! Go order it right now! While your at it, order Anna too!!!!<br /><br />Lola And The Boy Next Door is a must read!!!<br />Cover: Love it! I loved Anna's cover too! I love how we get to see their faces this time and that they are sitting in awindow! I also love that they look like how they are described. Lola is very stylish and Crickett even has bracelets on! Hot! Adore!<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes<br />________________________<br />Review Based On Hardcover Edition<br /><br />Taken From Princess Bookieore!

B0046MOV8U|3.0|I found that this concert just didn't do that much for me.  Beyonce's other Blu-ray, The Beyonce Experience LIVE, is much, much more to my liking. The songs are just better overall. There are some songs on this title that I like, most the other title is just a better example of Beyonce's true talent.

B0067QPVJ6|4.0|A group of Norwegians discover an abyss...the hard way and uncover something they need a person who specializes in frozen dead things...Enter Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who is introduced while listening to \\"Men at Work.\\" She comes along so this movie isn't all about men at work.<br /><br />As it turns out, it is just another alien spacecraft and there is a frozen alien in the ice. Oh yes, there is also the proverbial storm on the way. The movie reminded me a bit of \\"Alien Hunter\\" which in turn reminded me of an earlier version of \\"The Thing.\\"<br /><br />The alien appears early in the movie and quickly gets filled with lead. If you have seen any of these films you know the rest of the story.<br /><br />The \\"scientific\\" aspect was better than the previous films. I still didn't buy them performing the world's first alien autopsy and no one films it. The cells as viewed under a microscope was very primitive special effects, apparently they had blown their $8 million budget when it came time to create that scene and resorted to drawing pictures on cards and flipping them real fast. The rest of the special \\"Re-animator\\" type effects were fairly decent. Good one to see.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity
B0025UHKNS|1.0|Here are my impressions after having the watch for about 3 days and using it a few times in that period.  I used it for an ~7-8 mile run, 8k on a rowing machine, another walk interacting with the basic features. My background: I'm a fairly serious and toward-the-front but absolutely-not-placing runner (5ks to ultras, roads and trails):    1) HRM did not \\"just work\\" out of the box.  After lots of frustrating attempts to get it paired, including jiggling the battery and trying a new battery, I *again* tried to re-insert the CR2032 and finally must have not had a good connection the first ~dozen times because during \\"Searching...\\" from the HRM setup, it immediately said that a HRM was detected.  I can't speak to the accuracy yet, but pairing was much flakier than I thought it should have been.    2) I really dislike the location of the \\"lap\\" button.  For runners (and IMO) this is the most important button and it should be the easiest one to find and press for workouts.  Setting up \\"auto-lap\\" functions with the GPS is definitely NOT better - you want to start and split on points on a track, not a dependency on when the GPS thinks you've crossed some threshold.  The lap button is one of the physical buttons on the lower right.  My old Timex had a large, flat button on under the face of the display which was super easy to find and press.  I'm not trying to nitpick a small bit of the design - I really think this is important on a watch like this which is why I call it out.    3) Not crazy about the displays during training.  For some reason, it keeps throwing up a big banner \\"Hold reset to save activity\\" obscuring most of the display. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong and I'm sure I don't care right now about saving activity, I just want a stopwatch to go and tell me some splits.  Also, I don't like the layout of the time values in the UI - it displays the following (laid out like this)    AGGREGATE_TIME <-- this is big  LAP_PACE TOTAL_DISTANCE <-- these are smaller    Again, for a workout I would much rather see my split time, but the watch doesn't give me an option for this (after you mash the \\"Lap\\" button, you see a display for ~10 seconds showing that split time).  I can review this extensively afterward, but I can't see it during the workout (at least not easily - maybe I just haven't figured it out yet).  I haven't trained with a GPS in a while to have an opinion on whether I would rather see lap distance vs. total distance, but as far as I can tell, the device doesn't give me the option so hopefully I want total distance.    4) general design and overall feel - these are good.  The HRM is like others I've used but other reviewers give it high marks so I'm guessing it will be accurate (I can say it feels identical to others I've used before). The GPS locks fast and seems OK, which is my basic expectation for a device like this in 2011. The watch feels a lot less bulky than I expected (though I would still only ever wear it during exercise), which is a significant plus. I very much dislike the bezel. This is pretty, but aggravatingly not easy to use / takes time to learn.  To interact with it, you tap, tap and hold, or slide to scroll between menus.  I believe buttons would be more precise and more intuitive, but uglier and much less sleek. It's obvious from the reviews that others either prioritize differently or that I'm just clumsy or haven't learned to interact with this very well yet, but that's my initial feeling on this.    5) a couple more things I'm not crazy about: I used to have a 10* series Forerunner.  The GPS was slow to lock and this was like having a graphing calculator strapped to your wrist, but I really liked the small map UI that this device offered.  I once took it on a backcountry snowboarding trip with friends and that device helped me realize that on our descent we had veered far from our uphill course. It might have saved out lives.  The 405 really can't do this because it seems that its \\"return to start\\" behavior only gives you a compass reading for your trajectory to get back to the srart (the 10* had a small map). The manual indicates tha the battery will only last about 8 hours. This would not have been long enough to get data for a 50 mile trail race I did last summer (I guess I should get faster!)    6) the offered \\"workouts\\" functions look pretty good, but I haven't tried using these much yet.    Overall, my initial sense is that I like a lot of the data this looks like it will capture, but it seems better for people who want to import the data into a computer so they can look back on it after the workout than if you want it to help you measure and improve performance DURING a workout. It also seems to miss what I believe to be basic important design elements for such a device (how you get and interact with lap splits), however it does LOOK good.  A lot of this is influenced by having a 10 year old Timex that stores 50 lap splits (more than you can usually find) that is simple and works really well, so I'll try to come back and revisit this review when I've spent more time with the device. So for now, even though most of my feedback is critical, I'm evaluating at 3 stars because I want to give it the benefit of the doubt that it will impress me over time with its more powerful features.    UPDATE: I've completed my first and probably only workout since getting the HRM to pair and it's inaccurate enough that I have to demote this product to 1 star.  The watch seems kinda OK (more on that) but the HRM is just laughably inaccurate. The workout I did was three repeats of an ~5.5 mile loop on trails that includes some elevation change.  Here are the stats from the watch: [...]    Before starting, I wet the HRM and it was in the correct place on my chest and I'd say it was on quite snugly (i.e. I believe I was using it right).  If you look at the HRM data, it says I spent most of the workout at 230bpm+ and finished with an average 199bpm. I'm pretty sure - and I'm going to check this again now - nope, my heart did *not* explode today, so I think this is probably wrong. After the workout I hit the split to cool down for about 5 minutes and looked at the HRM again and after those 5 minutes it said I was at 234bpm!     So, the heart rate monitor is, in my opinion, terrible.  Let's go back to just the watch for a minute:    The frustration I mentioned in my original review about the split button is still affirmed.  I had trouble hitting the split and when it doesn't work, I naturally compensate by holding the watch with another finger opposite the split button but this results in an interaction with the touch bezel and my split not getting recorded. This might be the type of thing I'd adapt to with the watch, but it's annoying to need to adapt instead of this just working.    I'm pretty positive now that there isn't any way to customize what data is shown on the training screen and I think it's not designed well for people who are serious about running. Cumulative time is less important than split time, Garmin - this isn't news.    I established that the HRM definitely works poorly for me but the HRM data + watch calculation of my caloric burn earns the watch itself another ding, too.  I'm 6' and weigh >180 pounds and the Garmin has this profile data about me.  Somehow, the watch estimated this run (16.25 miles with 3400' net elevation change) to be a 1359 calorie run.  First, I don't believe that - this is a challenging run and I was moving at about an 8:48 pace (the total pace calculated on the Garmin connect page is off because there's a 5 minute split at the end where I was standing around the parking lot to collect HRM data but did not move).  That would put my net (I assume this is showing net - if it's gross it's even worse) caloric burn rate at 83.5 calories/mile (keep in mind, the watch thought this was a 199bpm workout). I don't even know how it could project that.  I'd love to think that this accurately reflects my efficiency as a runner, but I think it's just a lot more likely that this product deserves a 1 star review, so here it is.

B004SGWYVA|3.0|let me start out by saying if you are a boy who is 18 or under, this series is for you. its got well animated action sequences, blood all over the place, and giant bouncy boobs plus panty shots every 5 seconds. i gave this 3 stars, but you would give it 5. you guys are young, you dont want to think to hard when you watch something. so watch this, i know you will love it. also, if you wait after the credits of the last episode, they even hint at a second season...zomb-gasm!!!  for all you guys who are in your early 20's or older and are not young at heart, then this will probably just be an average piece of media to you. you've all seen hundreds of action movies in your youth and action doesnt get you pumped like it used to and blood isnt shocking anymore. since your hormones arent out of control anymore, sexual content every 5 seconds is just annoying. the story has its unique parts, but mostly you know whats going to happen. that guys going to die, this guys going to live, the groups current headquarters are going to be invaded by zombies. as adults, we just know whats going to happen.  as a man in my early 20's who doesnt even watch super hero movies anymore, i have rated this 3 stars. like i said, its not completly unoriginal. i wanted to finish this series just to figure out the small things i couldnt guess. some people i obviously knew were going to die, but some i didnt. even if i watch a movie and can guess 99% of the outcome, i still finish it to figure out that 1%. its how i work. but if your not like me, and your looking for a story filled adventure where you have no idea whats going to happen next, this isnt for you.  now listen carefully, all you who are not of man flesh, for this series is NOT for you. maybe, if your a female 18 or younger who enjoys action like the boys of your same age do, you might give this 2 stars. simply because you enjoy the action, but if you watch this, you will be HORRIFIED by how much they toy with women in this series, unless your a lesbian. they make it look like the word girls is just japanese for sex, and ive seen anime do it before, BUT NOT LIKE THIS!!! to you, the sexual content just might be more scary then the zombies.  if your a mature, pure girl who is in her early 20's or older, DONT WATCH THIS SHOW. just give it 1 slut of a star and never watch it.  p.s. this is my first review ive ever made for anything on amazon. i hope it was helpful, and i hope that no one was offended by my silly, crude, jokes. for all i know, amazon could delete this review by tommorow morning=)

B000ICM0YY|5.0|As a huge Gilels and Beethoven fan I had to get this.  As with most others I am very saddened that the complete set wasn't recorded.  Especially Op.111  Listening to this set opens up a whole new world of Beethoven.  The rich warm sound of Gilels is an absolute joy to listen to and it has made me rediscover beautiful sections in many sonatas.  I found myself deeply moved by Op.10 No. 3 again for instance.  I think Gilels' Waldstein is the best I have ever heard and I love the fire of his Appassionata.  The CDs come in cardboard envelopes inside a cardboard box. So its budget, but that just makes it more affordable.  One of the sets you have to own.  I bought the Pollini set of late sonatas to compliment the set and it serves very well.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|I've been buying CD re-issues lately to fill in gaps in my collection, and to load them onto my iPod. A lot of them are really over the top with compressed and un-naturally bright sound. I suppose this makes them sound better in some mp3 players, through less-expensive headphones or ear-buds, but they certainly sound terrible on my home stereo. And I'm not comparing them to the vinyl originals, either. Even the first wave of digital re-issues sound better in many cases (and IMHO) than the hyped-up sound and volume of some of these new digitally re-mastered re-issues.  Well, I'm happy to report here that the new re-issue of Pink Floyd's The Wall sounds almost as good as my vinyl edition, bought on the day of its release in the US. This is the new but standard red-book CD in the digipak (which I just bought from Mars on Amazon) I'm commending, not the 5.1 SACD or the gold CD. It has dynamic (loud and soft) contrast, its not (re)-mastered at the highest possible volume, and they don't seem to have boosted or altered any frequencies when compared to the original (vinyl) album. I usually don't think of CD's as being anywhere near vinyl, but this one is close. So I gotta give credit where credit is due. This is one of the few new CD remasterings that I've heard in a while that actually sounds good. I'm sorry I don't have any of the other new Pink Floyd - maybe somebody else could write about them.
B000001GXB|5.0|I find myself listening over and over to Op.111  The playing is excellent (although not with the fire of Richter, but who can match that?)  Sound quality is good too. Something that puts me off the Kempff recordings a little.  This was my choice to compliment the last sonatas in the Gilels set and I am very satisfied.  An excellent set to get. The last sonatas are very special and amazing to listen to.  I think Pollini does absolute justice to them too.
B004LWZW2E|1.0|This didn't scare me and it was cheesy. The chucky movies are scarier than this. Long story short, no impressionable visuals or story line. Save your money.
B000001GGV|5.0|I am not always a fan of Pogorelich, but this CD does not disappoint.<br />I am not perfectly happy with the set of sonatas, but that's just because I prefer the ones on Shiff and Horowitz recordings.<br />This CD is a good compliment to the other 2.<br /><br />Sound quality is, of course, excellent.<br />Its well worth buying this disk for some very good Scarlatti.
B004WDRSO2|5.0|I ordered this movie, and it was sent to me very fast. Came still in the shrink wrap, and in perfect condition. It was shipped on time, and was exactly what I ordered. Would recommend this company over and over again.
1847879071|2.0|The book overall does a great job integrating formulas, theoretical underpinnings, and detailed worked examples, including SPSS command procedures and output interpretation.   However, does $ex, $emen, etc., really sell stats to undergraduate women? Or does it make them feel uncomfortable in a subject they might already worry about mastering because of gender stereotypes?  Countless examples from Field's book show research on sexuality. Why?  I assume he thinks because undergraduates have that on their minds, it might be a nice teaching tool. I disagree and I would like to hear reviews from undergraduate women whose professors used this text.   It reminds me of a 65 year old econ colleague telling me that in his intro to econ, he talks about how the supply curve is like a p#allic symbol. He is also the same professor who announced to his students that he could not believe a woman had gotten the highest score on one of his exams, because that never happens. At any rate I shared with him that when he was a cute, young assistant professor, maybe the young women were in fact titillated  by his comparison and use of Freud to explain supply and demand, now that he was more advanced in age, they most likely thought of him as a dirty old man or a lecherous grandfather.       As a professor I try to make everyone feel included in the classroom, and at my age, I don't care if there are $ex examples personally or not, but I am not an undergraduate female doubting my skills and having a male professor teaching me stats while talking about libido and 3jaculate. It sounds like there is a a psychology lab experiment in there somewhere! Maybe Professor Field can use those results in the next addition of his text. I have read the text and would not suggest its use because of his research examples.    Why the dollar signs and hashmarks in my post?  Amazon would not post my original review because I used words from the actual book to describe examples and that looked like profanity tothem.  Thank you for making my point for me Amazon. Wow.
0634022296|5.0|I recently bought this songbook with the hopes that it would provide more chord-based instruction rather than tablature and standard notation. Right away, I knew I hit a home run. The layouts of every song penned by the four Beatles is very easy to follow, with each chord chart displayed. The key changes are mapped over the lyrics, so you can sing along and make the changes as you read through. The chords and keys are completely accurate. The only negative I can think of regarding this book is the absence of time signatures and tempo suggestions at the start of each song. But this is only a minor inconvenience. It is best anyway to listen to the songs first and remember the feel and tempo of the guitars (or other rhythm instrument). The book works well for learning in conjunction with the recordings. Also of note is that this book does not include cover songs performed by The Beatles. On some of their early records, The Beatles recorded their own versions of songs by mostly American stars like Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, and many different R&B groups, so if you are interested in learning The Beatles' versions of these songs, you'll have to find them elsewhere. Included in the book are some very early Lennon/McCartney/Harrison songs which never made entry into The Beatles official recorded canon. I highly recommend this book, as it is educational and very fun to flip through, whether you're a kid learning to play guitar, or a studio professional.
B005FUTBV4|5.0|i loved this movie.  kevin smith is the best director of all time and i am very sad to hear he is retiring after his next movie.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|Great acting by all, particularly the kids. I liked the story line and the setting. The train crash was really well done. The extras kept me busy for another 2 hours. I particularly liked learning about the making of and the day in the life of a new kid actor. Overall it's a very good movie that I\\"ll probably watch again in a few years as I won't remember much about it.  But, like others have said there are a lot of similarities to other movies, except for stand out moments like in ET or Stand By Me that I am going to remember. You can tell in the Extras that J.J. was shooting for that, but just doesn't quite get there. I started out confused in the beginning due mainly to the trailer showing a train crash that I thought someone died in the crash, but I wasn't sure who or why until much later. Other than the boy looking at his mother's necklace throughout I didn't see a lot of emotion about the loss. The girl showed much more emotion acting in their little super8 movie then he did and the scene at the end where the boy goes from being totally scared to being totally calm facing the monster down a leap in direction emotionally. Also what was with the dogs, were they just scared and running off. What was the monster doing with the people? The violence in which he took them and then the pristine health of the victims didn't seem to match, particularly if they had been drug through tunnels. I guess they wanted a scary movie that was politically correct or didn't scare little kids too much.  Maybe it's because I am much older and I don't see the memorable moments with the same eyes that I saw ET or Stand By Me. I hope JJ keeps making more though as he's on the right track and hope to see the kids in more movies as they were naturals.
B002L6I9Z4|2.0|My son received this as a present.  The flash is too bright.  The picture quality is terrible.  The camera does not hold a charge.  So, about the only redeeming quality is that it is cute and the kids like it.  Basically it is a really poor quality camera with a Lego label.
B000W91RUG|4.0|I got hooked on this after seeing a few episodes on TV, so I decided I should go watch the all the earlier episodes.  Turns out I saw many already.  The first season was good, and it's interesting to see the character development still taking place.  I would highly recommend this DVD, and I plan on buying the second season.
0393064476|5.0|I was watching Charlie Rose last month and saw the author of this book interviewed by Charlie Rose. When it was mentioned that this book was about the Renaissance, I wrote it down immediately and took notes on the show and then checked for it on Amazon.com. My brother Zachary, is a Renaissance Historian and a professor of History at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago.   I knew that my brother would know about this book but took a risk to buy it for him as an early Christmas/Chanukah gift and did so several weeks before  Thanksgiving. As it turned out this book was on his wish list of things to read! I don't think he's had time to read it yet but he told me that it had good reveiws! So I feel lucky that I got it quickly and had it sent to him. He was surprised and happy with this gift!
B0053YGYO4|2.0|Mylo Xyloto is a strictly mediocre album.  After all of the waiting since Viva la Vida, this collection is supposed to represent the absolute best of the best songs that the band has been working on for more than 3 years?  Hard to believe.  Now Coldplay is my favorite alternative band, but the guys have released a disappointing album that doesn't sound much better upon repeat listening.  Princess of China is the best track, and it hardly features Chris Martin at all.  The lyrics are awful in general and overall this is a very overproduced sound with no heart.  Hard to admit it, after all of the anticipation of how great this album could have been based upon their existing body of work.
0439023521|1.0|I'll keep this short.  This book is a quick read because the prose is simplistic and lacks depth and detail.  There is a compelling quality to it, but after a lot of reflection, I found that I was compelled because I hoped that something good would come of all that happens.  In the end, though, nothing at all good comes, other than Katniss and Peeta survive.  They're still pawns of the system, still victims, and they've learned nothing--they haven't grown as characters at all.  The message here is \\"survive at all costs,\\" and the author keeps the main characters from having to make any difficult decisions by having other characters kill the combatants so that they don't have to.  And did I really just read a book in which 24 teens are put into an arena to kill each other?  Given the fact that there's almost no literary value to this work at all, that makes it pure entertainment.  Have we as a culture slid so far into depravity that we now entertain ourselves by reading about kids killing kids?  22 teens die in this book--22 teens are murdered by other teens, and there's no reflection on that fact at all on the part of the protagonist (who is also one of the flattest protagonists I've ever seen).  Truly sad and disturbing.
B001SH290S|5.0|This is my fourth copy of Blue Train. I fell in love it with the album on a small system in a dorm room capable of filling the room but not set up for active listening. Some years later, with a system that allowed me just to sit and listen, I bought a remaster and then, a bit later, an SACD version of the remaster. None won me over. In the previous releases, the numbers didn't fill the soundstage with genuine integrity. Instead, each instrument was neatly but discretely located. And the horns had a digitized bite: not the attention grabbing surge of a horn, but a kind of scrape that so many CD's betray. And I'm not a \\"vinyl is the only way\\" kind of guy. Quite the opposite. I love the clean, dynamic range of a brilliantly mastered CD. And that is just what we have here; Analogue Productions has got this one right. It swings with a kind of energy and integrity that its predecessors lack and the horns have the most natural tone without sounding smoothed over or softened to compensate for the kind of edge that digital sources can bring. Just brilliant, a complete home run. (That this is an awesome Coltrane album I take to be an already settled issue.)
B002VECM6S|5.0|Such a great story!!  Great acting all around, and such a \\"feel good\\" movie.  My husband and I both love it and have watched it multiple times.  Sandra Bullock absolutely shines in her role!!
B00650SSWG|1.0|I rented this movie because of the positive reviews, and found it to be a waste of time to watch. I rarely post reviews, but had to do it this time to offer another point of view. Uninteresting storyline - it has been done sooo many times. The characters are cartoonish and use profanity for impact. Unartistic use of nudity and tasteless toilet humor. This movie has no redeeming aspects to speak about.
B0068TJLSY|4.0|This is a good family movie, for teens or older. The kids do a really good job of acting and I think that makes it especially appealing -- for both kids and adults. But it's somewhat light on plot and a bit predictable, but it still keeps your attention.
B00632HWOG|2.0|in general it's a nice app. But, the limited display of new messages is a major handicap to the usefulness.
0525421580|5.0|I was sent the book promptly with an invoice included if I had any problems with the book. I would order from this company again.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I bought this movie and the first Chocolate Factory for my grandchildren. They love both of them. They want to watch them all the time.
B0068TJLSY|3.0|We thought the acting was good.  The special effects especially during the train crash were enough to make you sit up straight in your seat. After the train crash, the movie got more and more incredible.  With the writer producer team of JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg we really expected a movie in the ET class - it was NOT.  The thing that bothered me most is that depicting the US military as the villain is a movie ploy that is shabby and has gotten threadbare with repeated use.  We just expected better.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|Conan is not a fantastic movie but it is a good movie. I found it better than the Scorpion King and just as good as The Prince of Persia. It has a good story with a nice array of characters to fill the world of Conan and for those who thirst for blood there is plenty of it splashing the screen. All the actors do a great job in their roles, the special effects are just right not to over the top and the enviornments fit the feel of the movie perfectly. This movie wont blow you away but it will entertain you. I was a big fan of the comic book series back in the day and with so many stories available I hope there will be many sequels to come.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I was eagerly awaiting this movie to come out on DVD. I saw it twice in 3D in the theater. To my disgust, it didn't come out with a two disc DVD version, but one DVD and Ultraviolet Copy. I don't plan on buying such a waste of money. I can rent it from Blockbuster and Netflix to my heart's content and watch it here on Amazon Video.   Warner Bros should be very ashamed of themselves for this.  I don't have a Blu Ray player nor am I planning on purchasing one in the near future. In fact, I would say there are many movie viewers who don't have Blu Ray Players.   To make us purchase one, so that we can see the \\"extras\\" is selfish and greedy, typical of Warner Bros.  Stay away from the ultraviolet copy as the other reviewers have said. It's not worth they money.
B001H1255E|5.0|First off, I simple love Loreena McKennitt. Her music is so soulful and rich. I have been following her for years and have all her cds. She put out a small Christmas album a few years back that was only 5 songs, but oh what a 5 songs it was. I waited with baited breath to see if she would expand on that album and glory be she did. Midwinter Nights Dream is a luscious album that is my all time favorite Christmas/ winter's album ever. Even though I love Christmas music I tire of that same old music done just a little different. This album highlights songs that are not over used and creatively composed. Noël Nouvelet! is one of my favorites by far. And oh my, her version of Good King Wenceslas is filled with middle eastern drumming that gets you up and dancing. Enjoy the quite and the celebratory energy of this perfect winter's album.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a fun game. I love to play it on my kindle fire. my husband likes it too. thanks
B005LJITS0|5.0|Green Lantern was wonderful in every way.  It was a perfect Comic Book Film.  Felt like it and transcended it.  Couldn't be improved upon.  The click-ish (cultish) comic book fan press tries to squash comic films for a variety of reason's I am sure.    It was so refreshing to move beyond Batman and Superman for a moment.  If you read the 1960's-1990's Green Lantern comics you could see this had the right casting and action and storyline and special effects to work perfectly.  One only hopes DC does more of their great characters and gets them to the screen sooner.  Watchmen was great.  And we will see much more as well I am sure.  I hope to own the video soon.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I just went to a Christmas party and got this star wars set as a present. I'm so glad i got it now because on amazon this is $99.99 very high price. But it must be because it's Blu-ray and have extras on it. I can't wait to watch it!
B004LROUNG|1.0|I've read most of Grisham's book, I usually finish one on a flight to Asia. Not the Litigators this was a real sleep inducer. I had to force myself to keep reading thinking it would get better. I think someone on his staff wrote this then he put his name on it to save time. He is still one of the great trash novel writer of our time..
B005HXGE9G|5.0|New twist on old songs. Very powerful voice, some songs better than the original in the new arrangement. Worth buying.
B005J4TLN4|1.0|Moses is some cliche always angry don't mess with me chip on his shoulder thug, him and his gang rob a nurse, then they kill some alien who crashed on our planet, after that they start getting attacked by more aliens, at that point I'm not sure what the writer intended, are we suppose to start rooting for these thugs just because they're kids? I didn't because none of them are likable, the rest of the movie proceeds to turn Moses into some unapologetic anti hero, in the end all this movie's really doing is glamorize thugs
B0053JJLLC|2.0|Just cannot understand why so much effort was put into this book. . it is totally sci-fi.  Maybe all his books are written that way...  very poor and not entertaining.  Shirl in Seattle
1451648537|4.0|Not my favorite style of writing but still manages to keep you interested throughout the whole book.  There is much more to tell than what's in the book. I wish the author would have written Part I and II. One ending with Job's ouster at Apple and I,I life after Apple and the comeback.  I am sure there are much more interesting details that were left out. Specially when it comes to Jobs business dealing and relationship with Silicon Valley Alumni's
B0026OR2PE|5.0|I really loved this book. It is full of very practical advice and information. It reads like a conversation, full of examples that helped me visualize his ideas.  I highly recommend it.
B005O30Y5Y|2.0|I won't review the movie because we all know it was great.  This Ultra Violet thing is a total scam.  I tried for one hour to register and it just went in a loop.  It is completely impossible to register (you actually have to create two accounts - one with UV and one with Flixster).  I am convinced the whole thing is a scam to obtain marketing info on you and place tracking cookies on your computer.  You actually can't register unless you consent to allow UV to share your info with all sorts of marketing entities.  There is no way this UV thing will be in business 12 months from now.  Just buy the movie and skip this UV nonsense.  After all is said and done you will never register and never get the movie on your Ipod or Ipad so why pay for it as an option?

B0041D843M|5.0|I have always been very knowledgeable about nutrition & Health, So I Thought. I ate Meat & used Dairy most of my life. I loved Cheese and milk in my coffee, not anymore! I have always boiled or steamed my veggies and cooked my meat in olive oils thinking I was being a bit more healthy in doing so. I drink Distilled water use Bragg Aminos & Cider Vinegar and have read numerous books on healthy foods. Even though in the past I always ate Meats, Milk, Cheese and Oils In moderation I never thought they could be so destructive to my health. In the last year I started to lose weight because myself & my Wife decided to eat chicken breast instead of Beef and incorporate more vegetables into our diet which were saute, boiled & mostly nutritionally destroyed in the cooking process. We ate whole wheat commercial branded breads and not enough raw vegetables & fruits. I was diagnosed after a blood test with type 2 diabetes after constantly being thirsty and unexplained constant weight loss. I was in denial and in shock. I ate what I thought was healthy. Lean meats like chicken breast. Lots of vegetables olive oil  Whole wheat bread organic nut butters etc. I immediately started doing research on how I could have given myself diabetes I always thought that people who are heavy users of white refined sugars and corn syrups are the ones who get diabetes. I started searching for answers because I am not going to be a customer of drug companies or a pill taker, sorry I don't do prescriptions. I know from years of reading Paul Bragg books & other books on natural foods that the human body can heal itself of almost anything. I Found your book \\"THE CHINA STUDY\\" which I have read about in other books I've read about health and nutrition. I was blown away in what your book taught me about eating the way I was eating. Meats, Dairy, Oils and how they are so over processed and nutritionally dead and destructive to the human body. I immediately started to follow your advice based on your years of research Dr.Campbell and the blood glucose numbers keep going down every week. Thank you for challenging the status Quo and spending your life doing such wonderful research to educate people like me who thought they really new allot about foods. Thanks for saving my health & educating me. I am truly amazed at what I Am Seeing happen day after day!   I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERY HUMAN BEING ON THIS PLANET! IF YOUR NOT A READER THEN I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE DVD \\"FORKS OVER KNIVES\\" WHICH I ALSO BOUGHT. THE DVD IS BASED ON THE CHINA STUDY AND HOW A PLANT BASED DIET WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE!  THANK YOU T.

B0033780Y0|1.0|I found this unreadable.  The writing was horrendous, as if Freestone dictated it into an audio recorder and someone transcribed it.  He goes off on tangents and writes about only a small portion of Mercury's life.  What he does write about is mostly his own life inside Queen.  I gave up after Chapter 1.  All I could do, at that point, was skim it trying to find some coherent sentences.  I failed in that regard and went on to another book.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I loved the movie in theaters and when I ordered it on Amazon it was on time and just like the page promised.
0062060554|4.0|For all lovers of thrillers, especially psychological thrillers, this book is a great read. It is filled with intrigue and disquieting moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br />Yes, you do have to suspend belief a bit to get into the gist of this book. The main character forgets everything about her life every morning when she wakes up. This might be hard for some of us to believe, but if you do as I did, and just forget a bit the way our mind works for a well structured story, you won't be disappointed. Christine, our heroine, s an interesting person whom we get to discover along with her when she reads her own, daily, journal entries. She has a fresh voice, and a way of looking at her life, such as it is, that makes us root for her. The rest of the characters suffer a bit, since they are not expanded too much, but still they play a good bunch of supporting roles.<br />The writing is straightforward, which is a must for theses type of stories. It's confusing enough for the reader to keep track of what Christine knows and doesn't know, so to have writing that is almost start, helps to keep us interested and focused.<br />This was a fun book. It has some faults, but overall I truly had a good time reading it and I can recommend it without issue.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|As soon as I saw this when it first came out on tv about 3 years ago, I instantly fell in love with it.<br /><br />Yes, I know it had swearing, smoking and some other things like that, but It's not meant to be a a classic and classy Jane Austen story because it's a MODERN Jane Austen comedy and SUPPOSED to be set in today's world mixed in with the Jane Austen era. Of course it's going to be crazy and the casting not all that fantastic. They deliberately intended with this as it's not meant to be a 'serious' drama, so of course the actors will be made to act not as professionally as they usually would.<br /><br />I thought it was funny, romantic and very well made. 'Amanda' is not exactly your standard Jane Austen film 'pretty girl' with manners, she is an ordinary girl who swears and seems a bit of a dreamer which made it more likable as she was realistic, and not this gorgeous and perfect girl. It was hilarious seeing the reactions of her going into the 'Jane Austen' world with her modern clothes, modern language and appearance!<br /><br />I also liked how the other characters looked more as they would've looked back in Jane Austen's time, not just with clothing, but in appearance as they looked quite 'natural' and not with so much make-up on as other films. In other Jane Austen films, the girls are always stunningly beautiful girls, nice to see a difference in this film, same with the men.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|While this is not my favorite of the soundtracks, it is definitely still great. I was hoping that Muse would be on there, as well as Paramore or Linkin Park. I hope that the final soundtrack will be more like first one (Twilight).
0920668372|1.0|I have to agree with the \\"creepy\\" crowd.  I really love my sons, but if I ever drive across town in the middle of the night and climb in their window, someone stage an intervention.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is great with no annoying ads. I especially like being able to customize my own card backs. Pretty sweet!
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|Great movie and price but the ultraviolet digital copy I could do without. Another software that I have to install in my computer, if they would have let iTunes be the playback software of choice this would have been much better in my eyes.
0312576463|1.0|I usually don't review books that I ditch, but I got 3/4 into \\"Freedom\\" and begged off, I just couldn't deal with the depressing characters anymore. I just didn't care! Much too long and depressing! Family friend Richard Katz was ridiculous with all the sex stuff. I did read the ending (no big deal), and felt very disappointed I started it in the first place. Just not my type of book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|A must have great weather app for the kindle fire. You must be connected to a wifi network in order for it to work.
B0056369RO|5.0|I find LMFAO to be a good group to listen to because they seem like they are just having fun with their music.  It is not really serious, and it's got catchy beats.<br /><br />I like the entire album, and find myself listening to it more than I probably should!!
014241493X|5.0|John Green is a fantastic author.  I strongly suggest that everyone (mostly teenagers, but anyone older will still love it) read his books.  Paper Towns is funny but thought provoking, and carries lessons that are valuable for everyone.  And, on a sidenote, if you wind up reading his books, and liking them, you might just be a nerdfighter.  Look John Green and his brother up on youtube, specifically on their channel, the Vlogbrothers.  And if you like what you see, check out the numerous groups that the nerdfighters have formed, like the facebook group \\"Nerdfighters of the Greater DC Area\\".  If you enjoy John's books, odds are you won't regret this.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I like it. Amazon always has the music I want to buy, Google Play is lacking in that department. This player is fine, works when I need it, simple to use.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|If you are searching for a hysterical tale full of wacky characters and humor that boarders on pure silliness, then you have come to the right place. The laughs in this film come from the characters themselves, not just the scripted jokes, and the voice actors did an excellent job of capturing the inflections that make you laugh out loud. Also, this is the sort of film that laughs at itself and doesn't take itself too seriously. The stylized animation style, though not flashy or groundbreaking, is endearing in its own way. The story is simple and to the point with an excellent moral. Overall, it is the characters that make this film one of my families favorites.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|I really love this movie. I bought the DVD to replace my VHS - I don't know why Disney only decides to revamp and rerelease some movies and not others.<br /><br />This movie's heroine has a dry, sarcastic wit which I find very refreshing. Phil's character provides more slapstick humor that makes the kids giggle every time. It's a well rounded movie with fighting, humor, and glurge. The music is my favorite part.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|The headset was superb the first month. Then the left ear went out. Then the left headset snapped off. Then there was a short in the wire and wouldn't work unless I held it a certain way. Lastly it went into the trash.
0671027344|5.0|This book is spectacular.  After reading it, a friend of mine said \\"it should be required reading for anyone entering high school,\\" because it covers all manners of problems that the average adolescent will face, while also having so many more.  The main character, Charlie, uses his simple prose to convey unbelievable beauty.  I don't have a single criticism of this book.  It is honestly one of my favorites ever.  And the movie is currently being made, starring Emma Watson.  So you should check that out.
B003L7DK6U|5.0|Still-astonishing martial-arts dexterity and speed from Bruce Lee, a pulsating \\"Shaft meets the Far East\\" score by Lalo Schifrin, state of the art age-old oriental wisdom direct from the Shaolin Temple to you, cornily \\"hip\\" 70s dialogue complete with mightily righteous \\"Afro\\" hair, a quality villain who expires most enjoyably, entertainingly bad acting - what more could one wish for?  And on blu-ray? Well, a few blu-ray transfers have been disappointingly lacklustre (\\"Wall Street\\", for instance) but this is emphatically not one of them. A few grainy shots aside, the colour and resolution are superb and worth the premium over the standard DVD issue.
0807014273|5.0|This book is amazing, I enjoy the first half more in which Viktor E. Frankl focuses on his experience in the holocaust camps. Very well-written and analyzed. Definitely a book someone should pick up.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|UltraViolet is a short-sighted power grab. It is poorly executed and ill-conceived. I sincerely hope that sales are dropping for the films that ship with UltraViolet. And I hope that any talent that benefits from deals containing a share of DVD/Blu-ray revenue starts making their voices heard as well. This format needs to disappear.
B0064YKDNA|5.0|I did not think I would love this show so much - but I do!!  It is cute, funny and has a great cast.  The episode \\"Naked\\" had me laughing so much!
B0050KEVO6|4.0|I found this on a Pc last year and had hours of fun, I was so sad when I had to stop! I started playing this app this morning and its terrific! when I get stuck I just ask a friend or my bro for help and we figure it out. I feel sorry for the people who just quit and give it a bad review, they are missing out!!
0316010669|2.0|The first half of the book was definately worth the read and i would suggest you buy it just for the ladder half, however about halfway through he gets entirely off subject and starts talking about Coke-cola and Pepsi in taste tests vs entire drink tests etc... How things are advertised etc...  I can see how it fits into the subject, about Thin slicing, but he got so far off subject that i was no longer able to hold an interest in the book and stopped about 3/4 the way through.  The first half of the book talks about Thin slicing; the process in which your mind relates the information it is receiving to past events in order to gain an understanding of it. He gives numerous examples of this and it is rich in detail. Definately a good read until he gets off subject. Two stars.
B003UESJF6|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  Despite its rather conventional ending, 'Megamind' proves to be a highly entertaining twist on the superhero genre. Satirizing the origin of the Superman comics stories, we're introduced to two different superheros, Megamind and Metroman, as they arrive on earth from separate dying planets, in space capsules at the same time. Metroman's  is smooth but Megamind's is anything but--crashing into various meteors and debris like an out of control bumper car. A flashback chronicles how Metroman ends up with an all-American family but Megamind plops down in middle of the Metro City prison where he's raised by inmates to be a 'villain'. But Megamind is actually more like The Wizard of Oz than a hardened criminal--his dark side can best be described as a mischievous youthful offender, capable of rehabilitation.<br /><br />  If Megamind's delinquent mindset is his Achilles heel, Metroman is also trapped by his celebrity status. An Adonis with a chiseled jaw, Metroman flings babies in the air with aplomb as police officer shoot their guns as part of a blind celebratory approbation. Megamind and Metroman periodically battle one another for the affection of love object Roxanne (Roxie) Ritchie, a perky TV newscaster voiced by the talented Tina Fey. Roxie isn't impressed by their clumsy attempts to win her affections. She's bored after being kidnapped by Megamind and after being brought to his lair bluntly tells Megamind that your \\"plan never works\\". When Metroman arrives and engages Megamind in yet another physical confrontation that always ends in a stalemate, Roxie wittily queries: \\"Girls, girls, you're both pretty. Can I go home now?\\"<br /><br />  'Megamind' breaks into its second act when Metroman fakes his own death and the blue-skinned Conehead finds himself experiencing an 'existential crisis'. Without Metroman, Megamind laments, \\"it's just too easy now\\". In his 'despair', Megamind's delinquency in Metro City (or 'Metrocity' as he puts it) multiplies exponentially. Megamind steals all the artwork in the city's museums and places them inside his own office inside City Hall. He throws currency all over the streets as if it's confetti, but none of the mischief makes him happy. Finally, using an idea he appropriates from Roxie, he decides to create his own superhero so he can once again find some meaning in his existence. NY Times critic Stephen Holden puts it most succinctly: \\"The movie's central joke -- that good and evil are meaningless unless both exist in continual opposition -- is unusually sophisticated for an animated movie.\\"<br /><br />  Megamind's new opponent turns out to be Roxie's cameraman, Hal, a geek who expects women to flock to him without mustering any effort to charm them. Before being injected with Megamind's new preparation that alters his DNA, Hal is a harmless nerd who reminds me of a caricature of Bill Murray's cameraman in the classic comedy, 'Groundhog Day'.<br /><br />  There are tons of funny moments in 'Megamind'. Here a few that come to mind: when Megamind tells Roxie they're making renovations at the Metroman Museum (\\"we're having the walls and ceilings removed\\"); when Megamind throws the dynamite at his mini-bots and apologizes (\\"Daddy's sorry\\"); Minion's expression when he leaves Megamind (stifling his tears and then displaying a stiff upper lip); Titan's lame comment after Roxie rejects him (\\"Wow, our first fight\\"); the reaction of the man with the baby in the restaurant when Bernard is transformed back to Megamind (his eyes are wide open in disbelief!).<br /><br />  Despite all the good stuff, 'Megamind' loses its way when introducing 'Titan', a character that diminishes the comic tone of the film's second half. Although Megamind was always up to mischief , he never had murderous intentions (remember how surprised he was, when he thought he had killed Metroman). Before Megamind's misguided intervention, Hal was like many other geeky guys who simplyhadn't discovered the right way to charm women. Remember it was Roxanne herself who confronted Titan and reminded him that he was not such a bad guy after all, BEFORE he was transformed. This is what Roxanne says to Titan right before he ties her up on the tower: \\"I want to talk to the real Hal...I want to talk to the guy who liked being a cameraman, and eating dip and being a nerd and being not as scary as the Titan Hal.\\" In Roxanne's view, before the injection, Hal may have been \\"self-absorbed\\" and perhaps a little \\"selfish\\", but certainly not in her eyes, a creepy stalker. He had his \\"issues\\" just like Megamind and Metroman, but they were all multi-dimensional characters.<br /><br />  Only Titan is a one-note character. He has no charm and doesn't really fit in the Megamind universe due to his unpleasant attitude and non-stop nastiness. When he actually tries to kill Roxanne by lobbing the bus at her, the movie suddenly turns in a rather sour, unfunny direction. I realize that once he was injected, all of Hal's bad points were magnified to the point where he became a psychopath. But why was that? Why couldn't Hal remain the goofy nerd, even after Megamind injected him? Everything else in the movie was FUN, but once Titan turned into who he was, things weren't much fun anymore.<br /><br />  In essence, there needed to be some kind of explanation in the script as to WHY Titan became a psychopath.

This is what Roxanne says to Titan right before he ties her up on the tower: \\"I want to talk to the real Hal...I want to talk to the guy who liked being a cameraman, and eating dip and being a nerd and being not as scary as the Titan Hal.\\" In Roxanne's view, before the injection, Hal may have been \\"self-absorbed\\" and perhaps a little \\"selfish\\", but certainly not in her eyes, a creepy stalker. He had his \\"issues\\" just like Megamind and Metroman, but they were all multi-dimensional characters.    Only Titan is a one-note character. He has no charm and doesn't really fit in the Megamind universe due to his unpleasant attitude and non-stop nastiness. When he actually tries to kill Roxanne by lobbing the bus at her, the movie suddenly turns in a rather sour, unfunny direction. I realize that once he was injected, all of Hal's bad points were magnified to the point where he became a psychopath. But why was that? Why couldn't Hal remain the goofy nerd, even after Megamind injected him? Everything else in the movie was FUN, but once Titan turned into who he was, things weren't much fun anymore.    In essence, there needed to be some kind of explanation in the script as to WHY Titan became a psychopath. Perhaps he encountered some Kryptonite type substance that made him act that way or perhaps Minion used the wrong DNA when the formula was being prepared. Some may believe on the other hand that Hal was innately bad and Titan merely represented a magnification of his evil nature.

No matter how much I may like a particular film, I will not spend money on any movie that ships with UltraViolet. And I am not just going to let them move my money around - I will also not buy this movie in any digital format or from Amazon.co.uk. This needs to stop.

Great for anyone interested in flying, or simply needing an easy to read watch. Family owned company with a quality product.<br /><br />EDIT: Been wearing for over a month, keeps perfect time and all functions are GO. I wanted to add this because some reviews of Invicta indicate they stopped keeping time. If this watch has an issue, I will update again, but so far I am very happy.<br /><br />EDIT: 7/16/13 This watch is still going strong. I have yet to replace the battery even though it spends weeks at a time unused. It still looks great and keeps perfect time.
0446573019|5.0|Unlike some thriller authors, David Baldacci doesn't stick to the same formula in every book or keep trotting out the same characters time after time. He has built a fascinating stable of characters over the past 20-plus novels -- some I'd like to read about again, such as \\"Oliver Stone\\" or the sisters who are police chief and a disgraced ex-cop in D.C. And I'd like to see John Puller, the new protagonist in Zero Day, return so we can learn why his brother was convicted of treason. (I'm betting he was set up!) What impressed me most about Zero Day was the author's skill at pacing the storyline. The tension built steadily toward the end until in the last 50-odd pages we learned the stakes were far higher than one could have thought possible. And some excellent plot twists involving characters who were not as though they appeared kept me engaged right to the end. As is always the case with Bsldacci.
B005UT29Z0|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  'Margin Call' is first time writer/director J.C. Chandor's distillation of the 2008 financial meltdown. Chandor creates a compilation firm based on Lehman Brothers and other Wall Street firms that tanked during the Wall Street economic crisis. The action is compressed down to one evening and a following morning despite the fact that the actual meltdown took place over a few months. The characters are entirely fictional and I heard that Chandor, during a talk at the new Lincoln Center film center, created the characters without consulting anyone specifically on Wall Street but then had some friends who were in the financial industry, look the script over once it had been completed.<br /><br />  The plot is rather simple. Things come to head at Chandor's fictional firm, when seasoned risk management executive Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) is fired after another company downsizing. As he's being escorted from the building, he hands his subordinate, former physics ace, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), a flash drive containing a snapshot of the seemingly deteriorating financial situation at the firm (one wonders why 'security' allowed him to hand the flash drive over to Sullivan). A series of executives then are informed of the crisis, culminating in the arrival of the big boss, John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) who decides to sell off most of the company's assets resulting in big profits for the few executives and employees left at the firm but curtains for the rest of the underlings as well as a nasty kick in the pants to the overall US economy.<br /><br />  Frankly, Chandor's attempt to dramatize the economic crisis is admirable but the subject matter doesn't really lend itself to palpable drama. Part of the problem is that many people (including myself) don't really understand how the financial system works. Chandor goes to great lengths to provide a simplified explanation for the financial collapse, but to be honest I still don't understand what it's all about, despite all of Chandor's attempts at transparency.<br /><br />  Without a tension-filled plot, Chandor must fall back on strong characterizations of the principal players. Jeremy Irons really saves the day as CEO Tuld. Irons is the only actor amongst the solid cast, to turn his amoral financial executive into a flesh and blood human being. He also happens to have the best lines of dialogue in the script. Irons serves up a superb speech at the film's climax, detailing his cynical philosophy that financial downturns always occur in history and are unavoidable.<br /><br />  The rest of the cast do their best in roles that are sorely underdeveloped. Quinto neatly conveys the integrity of a former \\"rocket scientist\\" who admits taking a job on Wall Street, simply \\"for the money\\". But Kevin Spacey struggles in his role as Sam, the ethical company man who refuses to quit because he also \\"needs the money\\". Chandor awkwardly attempts to humanize Spacey's Sam in the final scene, where the executive attempts to bury his recently deceased dog, under his ex-wife's lawn. The problem is that we don't find out enough about Sam to care about him. The same goes Paul Bettany as Will, whose main claim to fame is that he hangs out at strip clubs. Simon Baker does his best as the cold as steel executive Jared but he too lacks a back story. Ditto for Demi Moore's Sarah Robertson, who's thrown under the bus by CEO Fuld right before the big sell-off. Stanley Tucci ends up with the sorry sad sack role as the canned supervisor, who also throws principles to the wind by returning to the company one last time, after being threatened with retaliation by the sinking firm.<br /><br />  Mr. Chandor must be commended for not only bringing the story of the the great 2008 financial collapse to the small screen but ensuring there were no happy endings. As in real life, the traders and executives broke no rules in this unregulated industry and hence were only guilty of ethical lapses, which of course were not punishable in a criminal court of law.<br /><br />  There are those who may be satisfied with Chandor's sketchy and generic take on the financial collapse that precipitated the current financial downturn, but there are many more books and documentaries that will provide a more thoughtful and detailed reckoning of what really went on Wall Street during those heady times. If however, you wish to start with the basics, 'Margin Call' should be your baby.f ethical lapses, which of course were not punishable in a criminal court of law.<br /><br />  There are those who may be satisfied with Chandor's sketchy and generic take on the financial collapse that precipitated the current financial downturn, but there are many more books and documentaries that will provide a more thoughtful and detailed reckoning of what really went on Wall Street during those heady times.

The book is very complete with information on a variety of things that you probably forgot about. It includes lots of cool pictures as well in case you wanted to peruse some of the things that you missed the first time around.  I highly recommend it to any Lost fan.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|There is NO reflow text and text size options on the kindle fire version. Makes reading regular 8.5 x 11 pages very difficult. The version on my HTC incredible is better as it does have them.  They say it does reflow text but there is no option I can find.  I wonder if adobe is losing it.  I hate version 10 on the PC while I enjoyed version 9.  Looks like quality control is seriously lacking.  Guess I will look for a better reader for pdfs.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The description is a little deceptive, the Blu Ray / DVD count is wrong, but the content it describes, is what comes with the discs so it can be overlooked.  Pretty standard packaging, Cardboard box with the thin plastic disc cases that have each movie separate, and some bonus content.  The quality is what you would expect as far as Blue ray when it comes to video quality and sound.  If you love the Matrix, your going to love this.
B001E45XT4|1.0|This headset appears to have a design defect in the headband.<br /><br />We purchased two of these headsets; my son's broke after about a week, on the left (microphone) side, right at the joint between the upright and the curved portion where it telescopes into the top part of the headband.  Mine lasted about six months and broke in exactly the same place.  There is a \\"stress riser\\" point where the upright is recessed to accomodate the microphone boom when it is swung out of the way, and this is where both headphones failed.  When I disassembled both headsets (hoping to repair one or both), I discovered that both headbands also had significant cracking in the same location on the opposite side.  If the left sides had not broken first, the right sides were ready to break soon anyway.<br /><br />Other than the weak headband, these headsets have fantastic sound and stay comfortable for long periods.<br /><br />Great value for this price point.  But the headband, being made entirely of plastic, just won't last.
038572179X|4.0|I saw the movie version of the story before reading it. I absolutely love the book version.  The book gives you such a pleasant feeling of resolvement at the end that the movie does not.  The tale is interesting, romantic, and rather capable of pulling at your heart strings.  The story is actually quite beautiful and intriguing in its entirety.  Recommend.

The binding is very high quality so this should last you a lifetime (so you can pass it down generation to generation and everyone can enjoy the best comic strip ever written).  If your looking for the complete collection this is the set for you. Just be aware that the books are very large and can be heavy.
B004L35GAQ|4.0|Like a lot of folks, I heard Sail and then bought the CD. However, there is a really wide variety of sounds and styles on this album and you won't get bored. Most of the songs have good beats and interesting progressions. The album trends towards electronica, but with a heavier edge to it like Nine Inch Nails...but not quite as dark. The album is a really cool balance of sounds and needs to be understood as one piece. This group is really moving into some unexplored modern rock territory here and it sounds good.
B00127RAJY|5.0|First and foremost - do not start ANY new high-intensity workout regime without consulting a doctor. The folks who ruined their knees obviously skipped this step! It's common sense people - if you're not a teenager anymore, have pre-existing knee problems, or experience ANY amount of pain when working out, you NEED to consult a doctor before even starting a new workout regime!<br /><br />I have a bad knee - this requires me to modify Jillian's workouts just a little bit. There's a LOT of jumping (high impact!!) in this workout. Listen to your body. When me knee starts cracking, I switch to running in place during the jumping jacks/jump rope/butt kicks portion of level 1. I don't do full lunges...whatever it takes to NOT screw up my knee more. I still got an incredible workout! Oh - and you CAN drink water. She even says you can pause for no more than 5 seconds - that's plenty of time to sip some water. I do it ALL the time while doing this workout.<br /><br />Bottom Line: This DVD provides a killer workout, but you should consult with your doctor before beginning this high-impact, high-intensity workout regime. Make sure you have something to pad your knees for knee pushups. Make sure you have water open and handy - you'll need it! Days 1-4 are the hardest - you'll be shakey and sore. Just a warning!

0380789019|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books.  READ THE PROLOGUE. Don't skip it. It's incredibly brief and you'll be glad you did. I usually skip them.  This book is an incredible tale of a man whose world is inverted. You meet exciting characters and see a new coinciding world that you couldn't imagine. There is nothing that I found inconsistent in this book or bothering. It is a fantastic tale and I fully recommend it.  My mom didn't quite enjoy it as much as she did, but that may be simply, because I enjoy fantasy and dark twists more (though I would not call this a dark book).  Fantastic and Interesting read.
0061726826|4.0|Faster, Less Detailed Review: A beautiful novel, one that will keep you glued to its pages up 'til the very end. I mean, I read it in one sitting of 2.5 hours. Delirium tells the tale of a young girl who has to decide whether to conform as the rest of society has done or choose the ultimate freedom, follow her heart. This novel shows her struggles, hardships as Lena Haloway agonizes over her decision: stay with her 'cured' family, let the government provide her with a match or give in to the unthinkable: love?<br /><br />So the words 'dystopian society' gets tossed around a lot when dealing with certain books. This concept can most definitely be applied to Lauren Oliver's Delirium. It depicts a dark vision of the future, an undesirable one, yet realistic nonetheless. I felt like at any moment the government could suddenly decide that love is a dangerous disease, one which the general population needs to be cured of. And that's probably one of the most thrilling, tense aspects of the book. The concept is possible.<br /><br />I was sure, from the moment I read the description, that Delirium was going to be a hit. Big factor of it's success, at least with me, would be the setup. Lauren Oliver managed to convince me that this society is real for the moment and this is what's happening. The government has decreed love, or more correctly, amor deliria nervosa, as a dangerous, fatal illness that everyone needs to be cured from. All persons over eighteen must be released from the possibility of obtaining such a disease. It was sickening, for me, to watch how the US population allowed others to make decisions for them: whether or not they should love, who to be with, who to marry, who to procreate with, what kind of job to have, where to go on with education. It was disgusting. Over the course of the book, I developed a festering resentment for the government portrayed in this society.<br /><br />Second biggie for me was the characters. These characters were real. You felt for them. In some ways you WERE them. At one point in your life, you felt as Lena felt: insecure, alone, and scared to love and be loved. Or perhaps you could resonate more with Alex: the boy who lost both his parents, grew up on forbidden land, born illegally so to speak, and was eventually separated from everything he'd ever known to fight for something he believed in. Or maybe you could identify more with Lena's older sister, Rachel, who took the chance to love despite what society thought, only to have her heart broken, and free-fall into a dark place, one of pain, of emptiness, sorrow, then gave in to the opportunity to make the pain go away forever. And while I was reading, I thought, would I be as brave as Lena's mother and risk everything, give up everything just to feel love, including the pain it brings?<br /><br />Though I was stunned by the time I got to the end, the ending played a huge role in my loving this novel, thinking it great. While I was shocked and sad, I turned it over in my head for awhile, and came to the conclusion that any other ending wouldn't have done the book justice. It needed to end the way that it did. Even though I may not have wanted it, may not have liked it, it was a great closing to this beautiful novel, one that I think spoke louder than anything else in the book.<br /><br />Want something amazing to read? Want a book that will keep you mesmerized 'til you get to the end? Pick up a copy of Delirium. Actually, I should say to pre-order it. *sigh* But, I do wish they could have given the cover a little more umph. It was so, so good, and yet the cover doesn't have too much going on. I do like the style of the font though. That's something. xD!E them. At one point in your life, you felt as Lena felt: insecure, alone, and scared to love and be loved.

B005NQ94KS|1.0|I bought this movie because I've liked Anne Hathaway in past roles. I had hoped for a real romance. If this movie had a plot, a script written by a competent writer, a director who wasn't asleep at the wheel, and actors who had studied somewhere besides the local community group, it might have stood a chance. This was a shameful waste of money that leaves the audience feeling suicidal at worst and ripped off at best. I haven't seen anything this hopelessly depressing on the screen in decades. Hathaway must have been truly desperate to take this on.

The movie has interesting background, but be warned. If you like the comic, this is literally nothing like the comic. Not even the ending. Since not as many people read before they saw, as a movie, definitely a good time.
0525423656|3.0|Why read: I loved Matched and picked up Crossed at BEA.<br /><br />What impressed me: It was a sequel to Matched! And all the characters were there! And, sadly, that's about it.<br /><br />What disappointed me: Crossed is definitely one of those books that struggles with being in the middle of a trilogy. Gone was the society that I loved to read about in Matched. Gone was just about every tiny romantic element. All that was left was Cassia's quest to find Ky. Her journey through the big, bad, non-society world. It reminded me a lot of the first half of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It was a whole bunch of dragged out moving around without anything all that interesting happening. Little was revealed that made this book necessary, never mind interesting. I was very disappointed with Crossed.<br /><br />Recommended: Only for fans of Matched that plan on reading the series as a whole.<br /><br />Continue series: I have to. I didn't enjoy Crossed as much as I had hoped, but Matched was absolutely fantastic and I definitely need to find out how it all ends.

What excitement would there be in normal solutions? This is a MYSTERY novel. It's DAN BROWN. You should read this book if you'll be excited by the strange science he weaves into this book.<br /><br />This book was a fantastic read. There is no way you could possibly guess what really happened and I LOVE that.<br /><br />If you like the type of book where there's a twist you couldn't see coming and ESPECIALLY if you love science (though you by no means need to love science or know anything) then absolutely give this one a try.

B003UESJH4|1.0|This is one of the most boring and over-rated movies I've ever seen.  I don't care that it's historically accurate.  It's just not entertaining at all.  Many people go through far worse things in life and I'm supposed to feel bad and enthralled by the struggles of the born with a platinum spoon in his mouth King of England and his st-st-stammering (P.S. it's a studder or speech impediment, not a stammer)?!?  Please...  How does this bore-fest beat out one the best movies of the past years?  I write of none other than Inception.  Now that movie was enthralling with a twisting plot, excellent direction, acting and action.

6305090564|5.0|One of my all-time favorites. Believe me, I'm no fan of horror/terror flicks, not in the least. But when it's blended with comedy, you won't find a more appreciative fan. Movies like '[[ASIN:B0018OIK0E Shaun of the Dead]]', '[[ASIN:B0053TWVA0 House II]]' and '[[ASIN:B002WY65VU Zombieland]]' are multiple-plays for me.<br /><br />And 'Deep Rising' is tops on that list, with just the right blend of hyper-kinetic action, sharp comedy and vicious monsterfest - all rolled into one powerhouse blast.<br /><br />This was the first time I actually saw a different side to Treat Williams. My only other exposure to his career were in a ridiculous 1970's musical and the &uuml;ber-classic Sergio Leone film 'Once Upon A Time In America', neither of which were memorable or particularly interesting from his character's perspective. Had absolutely no idea the guy could be so funny or believable as an action star. And as ocean transporter Finnegan, he mastered that ever-so-difficult comic skill: Deadpan Timing. How many actors work that in as a script 'must have' and then completely blow it? Lots. So it's appreciated even more when done right.<br /><br />However, this might be attributed to hit-n-miss director Stephen Sommers, who seems to have the uncanny ability to make movie magic with modest budgets and second-tier actors, but then he'll turn around and lay a doo-doo bomb when given carte blanch&eacute;. Appears to be one of those creators that works best under extreme constraints, forcing creativity to fill-in the gaps where funding falls short. Some filmmakers, particularly from the independent/guerilla school, just can't transition to a big budget project - that's a fact. I'm hoping his upcoming reboot of 'When Worlds Collide' falls into the former Sommers category and not the latter. It's literally one of the preeminent Sci-Fi classics, a touchstone film. And for anyone trying to reinvent the wheel, has the term 'career-damaging' written all over it.<br /><br />Honestly, after all the different performances I've seen both on the small and big screens, this is Famke Janssen's sexiest, most endearing characters. She's so delectable as Trillian - the perfect combination of smart thief and sexy chick. You almost wish someone had recognized the potential and produced a film just for her character. That red dress, that crooked smile - yum. In 1998 she was female perfection defined.<br /><br />And was there ever a more perfect film weasel than when played by Kevin J. O'Connor? Nope. And that's why he's so freakin' hilarious. And as much as I dislike typecasting actors, you have to admit, it's a solid career maker for some. That shrill nasal voice gets me every time - in every role. I literally cannot see the man without busting a gut. (laughing)<br /><br />Then there's the merc team. What a lot! You couldn't make up a better crew of hardcore contractors than this - impossible. Led by the incredible Wes Studi, whom I never tire of. And like Williams, I had no idea the man could be so damn funny! He needs more work - period. Love him in every role I've seen him, be it character or lead, small or big screen. A stupendous top-shelf actor whose mere presence elevates a film's status by one full grade.<br /><br />The remainder, in my mind, will always be The Standard when it comes to pay-for-play gunslingers: Jayson Flemyng, Cliff Curtis, Djimon Hounsou, Clifton Powell, Clint Curtis and the much missed Trevor Goddard. Man, I truly miss that Aussie. Fantastic action stud whose star was on the rise when personal issues took their toll. Even my young nieces were confused that one of their favorite pirates was missing in the subsequent Disney 'Pirate' movies. Broke my heart to tell them that he had passed away and 'The Curse Of The Black Pearl' would be his only appearance. So sad.<br /><br />A favorite that hasn't lost any edge over the years. If you enjoy this kind of monster-comedy-thriller, then this is definitely your movie.he small and big screens, this is Famke Janssen's sexiest, most endearing characters.

That red dress, that crooked smile - yum. In 1998 she was female perfection defined.  And was there ever a more perfect film weasel than when played by Kevin J. O'Connor? Nope. And that's why he's so freakin' hilarious. And as much as I dislike typecasting actors, you have to admit, it's a solid career maker for some. That shrill nasal voice gets me every time - in every role. I literally cannot see the man without busting a gut. (laughing)  Then there's the merc team. What a lot! You couldn't make up a better crew of hardcore contractors than this - impossible. Led by the incredible Wes Studi, whom I never tire of. And like Williams, I had no idea the man could be so damn funny! He needs more work - period. Love him in every role I've seen him, be it character or lead, small or big screen. A stupendous top-shelf actor whose mere presence elevates a film's status by one full grade.  The remainder, in my mind, will always be The Standard when it comes to pay-for-play gunslingers: Jayson Flemyng, Cliff Curtis, Djimon Hounsou, Clifton Powell, Clint Curtis and the much missed Trevor Goddard. Man, I truly miss that Aussie. Fantastic action stud whose star was on the rise when personal issues took their toll. Even my young nieces were confused that one of their favorite pirates was missing in the subsequent Disney 'Pirate' movies. Broke my heart to tell them that he had passed away and 'The Curse Of The Black Pearl' would be his only appearance. So sad.  A favorite that hasn't lost any edge over the years. If you enjoy this kind of monster-comedy-thriller, then this is definitely your movie.

1451627289|5.0|With such a vast catalog of work, it has become increasingly difficult for Stephen King's output of the last ten years or so to measure up to the past, or to be deemed \\"King-worthy,\\" so to speak.  Mixed opinions abound when it comes to the final three Dark Tower books, Cell, Lisey's Story, Duma Key, and Under the Dome, not to mention  the Bachman novel Blaze and the two collections, Just After Sunset and Full Dark, No Stars.  Despite this long-running lack of concensus, 11/22/63 looks like a bit of a comeback for the Stephen King brand.  For one, noted director Jonathan Demme signed on before the book had even been released to helm the film in one of the fastest turn-arounds from a book's release to a movie adaptation King has seen in years.  When an Academy Award-winning director wants your manuscript before the public even sees it, it's usually an indication of a pretty good book.  Add to that the fact that it's being praised by critics and fans both and 11/22/63 comes out a success all around.<br /><br />As a longtime King fan, which admittedly adds a certain bias, I was fascinated by the story, which went in different directions than I expected.  When I first heard that King was writing a book about going back in time to save JFK, I was interested, but less than thrilled.  Time travel is hardly an original concept, nor is the idea of changing the past, so I wasn't sure where King could go with that premise.  Well, he answered my doubts and then some, as far as I'm concerned.  The simplicity of the rabbit hole is perfect, and classic Stephen King.  I'm glad he didn't try to go the sci-fi route with some sort of time machine; instead, he chose a sort of interdimensional portal, not too different from those used in the Dark Tower books.  I was also captivated by the concept of the past fighting back, creating obstacles in proportion to the changes attempting to be made. It all had a feasibility that allowed me to completely suspend my disbelief, as the inexplicable existence of the hole, its random location, and its odd \\"rules\\" (opening on the same date and resetting with each use) made it seem that much more real, and made for incredibly fun storytelling.<br /><br />The book did satisfy my expectations of actually following Lee Harvey Oswald around and intimately observing his furtive lifestyle.  It felt genuinely chilling to experience him as a literary character, and looking over his shoulder had a dark, voyeuristic thrill that kept me turning pages long into the night.  As far as the assassination itself, King ignores some of the more plausible conspiracy theories, but his narrative tells the story of Jake Epping and Sadie, not of Oswald, so that makes sense.  I was almost disappointed when I first realized the book would go this route, but the characters and their stories are so rich and compelling that I lost that feeling quickly.  Jake, in particular, is one of King's best protagonists in many years, a thoroughly likeable, realistic character whose motivations are noble but believable.  He's very easy to root for, and you agonize over his pain.  Sadie and Deke are great characters, too.  King did a fine job of delivering both a mesmerizing plot and fully drawn characters.<br /><br />Speaking of delivering, the end of this novel does exactly that.  Given some of the ambiguity in recent King novels, I thought much would go unexplained, with Kennedy maybe being shot by someone other than Oswald without revealing the shooter, or Kennedy being saved but the changes to the future not being shown.  Not so.  Like early King novels, most everything is explained in an amazing conclusion that idealizes nothing.  King might be a liberal politically, but he has no agenda here to that end, knowing like previous authors of time-travel fiction that altering the past could never lead to a positive outcome, and certainly not to anything we could predict with any accuracy.  The infinite variables make the idea impossible, and readers andJake learn this together in heartbreaking fashion.  While I do have a preference for King as one of his fans, you don't have to take my word for it that 11/22/63 is a great book.  It's earning well-deserved praise from everywhere as one of his best.eartbreaking fashion.

B0054R6BFM|3.0|I have to start off by saying I don't know how to review this book... So many thoughts are running through my head. I'm not giving this book 3 stars because it wasn't good. The book is very well written. The reasons I give it 3 stars are below.  There are many things I could say, I'm not sure I should say them. But anyways here goes. I'll start off by saying that I do know what suicide is up close and personal. My mom killed herself when I was 21.  I didn't like the idea of the tapes. EVERYONE carries enough guilt around after the suicide of a loved one. More often than not, guilt they should not have to carry as it's not theirs to bear. You blame yourself for so much, I can't even image the real impact on people of receiving tapes of what they did making them feel guiltier.  If you take the book into context, each and every person had their own share of guilt, however in the end, who is really to blame? No one really. These are things that happen in high school (well most of them anyways). You must learn to deal with them and stand up for yourself. The real problem is, as in most suicide cases, not the people surrounding the person who commits suicide, but rather the person who commits suicide themselves. She could have saved herself. I know what rumours are like, I was one of those girls in high school, however you have to overcome them and those boys who think you're a piece of meat? You find the right way to push them away and make them understand (I found that a knock on the head with a heavy text book works wonders). She felt guilty about the rape but she could have also prevented that. She could have reached out for help more.  The bottom line is that life is hard for everyone. I would hate that a teenager could pick up this book and see it as a reason to justify an act they may commit. Like saying \\"Well she did it for less then what I'm going through, so why can't I?\\" Because to me these reasons didn't justify the means. Suicide is never the answer. Maybe I'm being harsh, but I have lived through the aftermath of a suicide (and still deal with every day). It's one of the most devastating type of death you have to deal with.

B004J4WKDI|5.0|Two ruthless masters, two rivals who were pledged together since a young age, only one can be the winner...  The Night Circus brings you into the midst of a universe of dreams. A place where the smell of caramel wafts through the air and the lights glow magically under the night sky, for the circus only takes place at night and no one knows when it will arrive or when it leaves. Every tent flap you lift brings you into a realm more enchanting than the next.  However all is not as magical as it seems behind the scenes of Le Cirque de Rêves, for the circus is only a platform for a duel being played out between two rivals. A duel that is a game of wits and imagination. From a young age Celia and Marcus have been trained by their respective masters for this challenge, however no one expected them to fall hopelessly in love with each other and from that moment on everything changes...  The Night Circus is simply amazing, a must read. I'm an avid reader and I read this book in 24 hours. This book is a page turner, once you start you won't be able to put it down. A stellar debut novel for Erin Morgenstern. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars. Pick this book up as soon as it comes out, you won't regret it!

B004FTSAMC|5.0|I've watched Bones for several years and have enjoyed the antics of the characters. I'm not a person who takes television too seriously. I get nervous when folks who write and star in TV episodes start talking about 'art.' The writing, acting, photography made this an exception. Of course, I can't be sure, but I think even a viewer who had never seen a single episode of Bones might find this particular story moving. Who among us doesn't find that while logic has been a  friend in most areas of our life, it has also shut out choices that we might have made, cut us off from people we might have included in our lives? Most times, I admit, I watch TV to shut off my worries, to get involved in someone else's life for a while. This time it didn't work that way. It made me think. Thanks, Bones.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|The Adjustment Bureau is quite the surprise.  It's a romance/science fiction type movie and... at first I didn't see how it was remotely possible to blend these two drastically different styles together and make something watchable, but after witnessing it I now see how!    Let it be known that I'm a humongous fan of movie concepts that are just plain *different*.  I honestly can't imagine anything else resembling the Adjustment Bureau.  It's definitely unique.  Leading viewers into thinking this is going to be yet another election/politician type plotline and then morphing into pure science fiction is a genius and *incredibly* surprising move.    Many complaints that I've read are that the plot is difficult to follow.  It's actually remarkably SIMPLE to follow- it's just that it's unbelievably different from everything else out there that it's hard to wrap your head around the concept.  It's about these mysterious uniform-wearing men that make special appearances before Matt Damon's character.  These men exist to make sure people do things \\"according to plan\\".  The word \\"plan\\" is a frequently mentioned theme while watching the movie.  You'll hear this word a thousand times, believe me.  These men don't really have a specific name, and at first their presence is hard to understand because they just *appear* under mysterious conditions, so you're not really sure what to think about them until the film gets going.  Well it turns out these men are convinced that Matt Damon's character has the potential to make a significant impact in his future concerning his role as a politician, so they always appear before him in a firm attempt to make sure he sets on the right course without any distractions, however...  Matt Damon meets a beautiful woman that he falls in love with (of course, just *look* at her!) and every time he loses contact with the woman, he meets her again by total chance either during a bus ride or while walking down the city sidewalk, which means this is NOT part of the plan!  Uh oh!  This means the mysterious men are going to cause trouble for poor Matt.  This means, according to the storyline, anything that goes against the plan will result in Matt's memory being erased.    Well... that particular aspect seems to fall by the wayside after a while, because later on the strange men demand Matt Damon's character to make a really difficult decision- either break up the relationship with the girl so Matt can eventually become a powerful leader (I assume president of the United States) and his girlfriend will become the most famous dancer in the world, or... they can stay together and ruin all the potential they COULD have had.  The choice is Matt's!  To another one more element to the storyline, one of the men actually comes to Matt's aid to help him with these tough decisions.  It sounds confusing but honestly the storyline is pretty simple to understand.  It's just a radically different concept that most of us haven't experienced in a movie before.  As a result, hey, I appreciate originality, so I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.    Sure, the concept of being able to change the future by deviating from a specific plan may seem really bizarre and unbelievable, but the fact the Adjustment Bureau is so original won me over in a huge way!  Plus I loved the beautiful scenery of the door concept- whenever Matt Damon or one of the other men would go through a door, they would appear in a different environment.  In one example, they went to a baseball stadium after leaving a dark stairway.  It gets our imaginative juices flowing.  You'll see what I mean when you watch it.  I love the Adjustment Bureau.  Basically the moral is that you have choices in your life, and free will, so you should take advantage of it.

B004UXUX4Q|3.0|I liked this movie - it was solid, the story was complex, the characters interesting and the director did a  fairly good job of keeping it moving.  A few minutes too many of lyrical shots of the Hawaiian landscape, flowers, butterflies...to no purpose except to slow it down so that it was about 10 minutes too long.  The best parts were the two daughters of the George Clooney character:  terrific dialogue, convincing acting and realistic reactions.  Also good were the other supporting players - the older daughter's boy friend, the realtor, the realtor's wife.  I thought George Clooney was less wooden than he was in THE IDES OF MARCH (more on that elsewhere) and he came across as very likable.  What was not so convincing to me was that he  was doing an excellent job as trustee of his family's wealth, as a negotiator with sophisticated developers and as a lawyer.  Just a little too relaxed and off-key to provide any intensity - and, after all, his intensity in work is the reason he is so disconnected from his family at the beginning.  I also liked the travelogue-like bits about the non-touristy parts of Hawaii.  Good movie; if you go with lesser expectations than I had from reading glowing readings, I think you'll like it better.  It did inspire me to want to read the book is was based on.

0525457585|5.0|No matter how good, perfect or sublime a movie may be ... the book on which it happens to be based is always far superior and that is so true of The Neverending Story. Michael Ende wove so many elements into his novel that helps children to build -- or reinforces -- their social mores. He is definitely a successor to Dr. Seuss.  The story revolves around a sorry little boy, Bastian Balthazar Bux, who has everything going wrong for him: motherless, fat, depressed and bullied. His only escape are the books he reads and when he encounters Mr. Coreander, decides to steal the man's book. Locking himself away in the attic, at school (where else would he go?), he begins to read the illicitly gained book. Slowly he discovers that the characters of the book are all talking about him. At first he is dubious and believes he must be imagining it, but, little by little, he finds that he is entering the world in the book.  What happens there, to quote the book, is another story and will be told another time!
B002VHI8FE|5.0|This is the best gritty fantasy series out there, except maybe (and I emphasize maybe) for ASOIAF.  The characters a sharply written, grey - there's no clear cut good and bad guys, although some are obviously more likable than others - the plot moves along pretty quickly, and it has some of the best dialogue you will read anywhere.  The action and dialogue are so real and visceral that you actually feel like you're there, and seeing the world through the eyes of each character.    The backstory is minimal but important.  The way the story is written, it barely feels like fantasy at all.  Feels more like historical fiction than fantasy.    One caviat though.  If you pick up this first book, The Blade Itself, prepare to purchase the other two books.  The first book is not a stand alone book in any way.  It basically sets up the action for the next two books.

B0053TMP24|5.0|This is probably Riordan's second best yet.  It's hard to deliver such an epinephrine-packed thrill ride with every book and still keep the Shakespeare-like style of every character, even the minor ones, having a distinct manner of speaking, but somehow Riordan does it again.  Probably &#34;Olympian&#34; was slightly better, but finales always tend to be better than the series average.  &#34;Neptume&#34; compares favorably with PJ 2 (Monsters), and is about equal to &#34;The Throne of Fire&#34;.  I personally felt that Percy's Achilles curse should have been dealt with a little less like something that could be just washed away, and perhaps more like a consequence of being able to defeat Kronos, but the Jason(the Argonaut)-esque carrying of Hera does carry a lot of symbolic weight.  The humor is less present and darker than in &#34;The Lost Hero&#34;, which fits well with the comparitive bleakness of scene, especlaiiy later in the book.  As always, humorlevel is indicative of situation seriousness, but humor is sligthly more spread out than in previous books.  I personally would love to see Kane and PJ/HoO series united for the epic battle, which will be a lot more epic than anyone else could manage, but that's just wishful thinking.  Percy action is fantastic, with all of those cool water control and earthquake abilities that we have come to expect from my personal favorite character.  Personally, I wish  had Frank's shapeshifting powers--it would make birdwatching a whole lot easier.  And Amazons named Doris and Lulu?  That's as good as the recurring name Leroy, which has been used for such varied nasties as Typhon and the Set animal.  Can't wat for Book 3 for Percy and the Kanes; now, if the first sentence of the next Kane book is something like &#34;The end of the world started during Napping class&#34;, I would do anything do read that book.  In the meantime, I will be reading &#34;Neptune&#34; and enjoying it every time.

B000002J09|5.0|This album represents the culmination of the musical talents of Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Bonham, and John Paul Jones. To date, this album has sold over 25 million copies. Black Dog has one of the most recognizable intros in rock history. The song was a perfect introduction to the rest of the albums well-crafted and thought provoking tunes. Rock & Roll is THE rock and roll song that encapsulates everything that rock is and should be, a fast-paced, fun-loving, and joyous compilation of everything rock represents. Misty Mountain Hop features what is arguably the best drum sound of John Bonham's storied career. The bass drum is hard-hitting and driving, as well as being highly precise and nuanced. Four Sticks is a departure from Bonham's usual technique, he employs four woods on this composition giving a sense of extreme urgency to the sound of the song. Going To California is Jimmy Page's stand alone track. He uses arpeggios, sweep picking, and alternate picking to give tonal variation. The song also has a decidedly country and folksy feel to it. Stairway To Heaven, the most requested song in radio airplay history, is a all-encompassing track that goes on for over eight minutes. The song starts slow, but builds in intensity throughout the track with a grand finale, Page, Bonham, and Jones playing at their best. The album closes with When The Levee Breaks, a song that gives the impression to the listener that you are on a long and compelling journey, much like being on a slow moving frieght train. The monotonous drumming of Bonham adds to this effect. This album is undoubtedly a MUST HAVE for ANY rock collection, your musical library is incomplete without it.

1451648537|5.0|What I most admire about Steve Jobs is the way he could have gone niche, high cost with his beautiful, high quality products - a la Bang & Olufsen - but chose to go mass market.  Niche would have been impressive.  Mass market, in an egalitarian sense, was brilliant.  Isaacson has obviously had to rush to complete the biography, which makes it a bit loose in places, but it is very readable, and that imperfection makes it more human in a sense.  I wanted to better understand a man that has been my hero for many years, and this book certainly helped me do this.

A friend persuaded me to download the sample on my Kindle and by the end of the sample I was thoroughly hooked!  This is a great series, well written and brought to life by a very talented author... I read the first book and immediately downloaded books two and three.  I understand that the first book is being made into a movie.  I just hope that they can bring to life the deep and emotional challenges the characters embrace in the novel.  Great read!
0439023513|2.0|I expected more from this book considering how great the first one was, but the pacing is shoddy.  The book just drags for pages and pages with spurts of action to keep readers from giving up on it.  The voice throughout the book indicates that the author didn't want to write this book.  The ending is abrupt and enough to keep fans from rioting.

B005FHXB0O|5.0|True Romance is one of the most overlooked movies of the 90's.  Unfortunately it was not a commercial success.  It's estimated budget was 13 million and box office returns were around 12.2 million.  Who knows why.  My opinion is that it was poorly marketed and studios didn't quite know what to do with this ultra violent, sharp dialogue style that became synonymous with Tarantino.  However it has achieved a certain cult status since it's release as more people came to realize Tarantino's involvement.  Quentin Tarantino wrote the screenplay and Tony Scott directed. Boy did the two of them deliver.  Each character has a diamond sharp set of lines to deliver that are worthy dialogue for a lead.  The cast is full of A-list celebrities and performances that will be burned into your memory for life.  Gary Oldman as Drexel the pimp with racial identity issues, the epic sit down between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, and Alabama's compelling sincerity are a few of the many stand out elements in this wonderful film.  Even Samuel L gets one of his classic cameos in the beginning.  What more can I say without ruining this movie for those who haven't seen it?  Part of what makes it so special is all the surprises.  So I suggest you sit back, relax, and suspend disbelief while you are taken on a very strange and very satisfying ride through a lesser known piece of the Quentin Tarantino universe.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I have been using this device for 6 months so far i have ran 300 miles . Initially i did not used strap with velcro , so after using it for 50 miles and so , The charging point got rust , i complained to GARMIN about this and they send me a new device   I also used this for a Philly half marathon and the distance recorded by watch was 13.40 Mi and couple other users also reported the same mileage. i think this was pretty much fair with respect to accuracy. i do not expect anything better than this.  Here are my some tips   1) Always clean your device after run . I generally clean it with Hand Sanitizer/ear bud.  2) After i got my new device from GARMIN i switched to Velcro Strap. In summer when you sweat more i will take toilet tissues and wrap it around the Velcro strap , doing so excess sweat is absorbed by the tissues hence there is less chance of corrosion at charging point.  3) to Save battery i always switch off the GPS  4) During rain i keep a small plastic ziploc pouch while running to safeguard the device.  So far i am very much satisfied

B0054TVW04|4.0|In \\"Civilization: The West and the Rest\\", Niall Ferguson presents a lively, grand analysis of why Western Culture has dominated the world for the last 500 years.  In this he follows in the footsteps of Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" as well as David Landes's \\"The Poverty and Wealth of Nations\\" (n.b., the best of the lot).  The book is entertaining and thought provoking.  It is also timely in that it covers the recent economic crash and also predicts the outcome of our future relations with China.   Ferguson suffers by comparison, however, to Diamond and Landes.  In particular, his presentation is not as cogent.  Sometimes he seems to make his points by delineating their negative space - we are given a lengthy list of what is not the case, but then left to our own devices to sort out what is left.  Another problem is the uneven prose.  The most unfortunate, wince inducing expression Ferguson uses is his characterization of Western Civilization's primary strengths (viz.,  decentralization of political and economic life, science, property rights, medicine, the consumer society, work ethic) as its \\"killer apps\\".  On the other hand, I enjoyed his joking reference to \\"Resterners\\", the opposite of \\"Westerners\\".  Ferguson does not shy away from controversy.  For example, he suggests that imperialism provided some benefits to the conquered peoples, and also updates Max Weber in suggesting that Protestantism was an essential ingredient to the commercial success of the West.  But he is reasonable rather than dogmatic, thought-provoking rather than bigoted.  \\"Not as good as Landes\\" can still be quite good.  \\"Civilization\\" is a good read, and will give you much to mull over.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|I'm a man in my mid-30's and this is the first time I've seen this movie.  I've heard about It's A Wonderful Life for years and years and just never paid attention to it.  When Amazon.com had this for one of its Lightning Cyber Monday Deals this past week, I did a blind buy for both the bluray and DVD formats based upon the amount of positive reviews.  Boy, I was right.  Worth every penny.  The movie is so great that I'v watched both the color and B&W versions in bluray.  The making of documentary was also great.  I became an instant fan of the movie and not to mention the beauty of Donna Reed.  The message of the movie is so classic and touching that I could watch it over and over again.  I bought the DVD version so I could give that copy to my father-in-law as he likes classic movies and It's A Wonderful Life being one of them.  I highly recommend this movie to all.  It is one, if not THE most memorable movie you will ever watched.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I saw Adele live at a small 300-500 person venue in 2008 and to see her play the Royal Albert Hall really is something. I was truly riveted by Adele's performance. Really good concert footage and such a great show with lots of re-watch ability. If you missed her tour this feels really close to seeing her live. She is amazing! I am going to watch this DVD hundreds of times. Also will make an excellent Christmas present to any Adele fans!

B005GVA2L0|5.0|I purchased this item as a gift for my boyfriend (he's obsessed with Amy Lee). I didn't choose the gift option because we do not live together, so it came in a box just like everything else I ordered. The CD/DVD set was shrink wrapped in brand new packaging. There were no marks, scratches or dents in the packaging at all. It came a whole week sooner than expected, and though I haven't listened to it/watched it yet, everything appears to be as it should be and in order. I would suggest buying this product from this supplier- it's absolutely worth it, and for the best price I've found so far!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|thank you for giving away the bible for free! the best investment anyone could ever make! If you have never read the bible, give it a try. It will change your life forever.
B005ZV8Q2S|2.0|Overall I really liked this movie. I would have given it a 5 star rating except for all the full frontal nudity.  It didn't seem necessary.  The story line is amazing!  I love all the interaction between the characters.  I just don't understand why they had to put so much vulgar language and nudity in this movie.  If they had cut that out to a minimum, the movie would be amazing.  I loved the characters and it was very funny.  Just wished they had made it a little cleaner.  It had a light porn moment in the movie.  So, if you don't like nudity and sexuality in a movie, then you won't want to watch it.  I think guys will like this movie more then women.

B001QOOCTE|2.0|I think the overwhelming amount of 5 star reviews is due to the \\"idea\\" or \\"concept\\" of this album.  From a strictly \\"musical\\" standpoint....it leaves alot to be desired.  Approach with caution.

1451648537|4.0|I had to read this book as my interest in Jobs and how he thinks has grown over the years.  I had always had the perception that Jobs had genius in finding simplicity where others saw complexity, and the book provides some of examples of this.    The author includes a number of Jobs' quotations, giving the reader another way to gauge how Jobs thought.  I have been surprised to hear some argue that he was no more brilliant many others in the field, in part because he did not write computer code.  I was surprised to see that Gates diminished Jobs on this point, and as a software developer, I believe that design is more important than writing actual code.  The author seemed quite detached from his subject, and I am not sure why.  Perhaps it was his way of maintaining his journalistic objectivity, or perhaps he did not personally like his subject.  The author seemed to favor people like Wozniak and Ives who were personally kind people, whereas Jobs could be cruel, manipulative, and so on.  The author leaves no doubt that Jobs was often quite mean, and one of the author's themes questions why he had to be so.  I don't think he finds the answer.  A problem with the author's detachment, in my opinion, is that he misses the emotion associated with Jobs' presentations.  The iPhone launch, as just one of many possible examples, oozes emotion and shows the relationship Jobs had with his followers.  One can watch that product launch on YouTube and wonder why the coverage in the book lacks any emotion at all.  In that sense, it lacks some accuracy and certainly disappoints.  One does not have to be a fan of Jobs to want to understand the emotion he engendered.  It is impossible to lose the emotion of his tragic fight with cancer which is covered in painful detail.  It is hard to read those sections without wishing the outcome could have been different.    I give the author credit for making the \\"reality distortion field\\" a recurring theme as it does give insight into the man.  Other than this and the cruelty theme, however, the books seems to lack cohesion, feeling instead like a series of unconnected accounts.    Some periods are barely covered, such as his time at NeXT.  Some debated questions go unanswered:  how much of the existing Mac OS comes from the NeXT OS and how much of the NeXT programming toolset makes up today's Mac/iPhone/iPad development toolset?  Is Apple a second incarnation of NeXT technology in some respects or not?  The book does not ponder these questions in enough detail.  If you believe, as I do, that the world has lost a brilliant thinker, then the book is worth reading to learn more about the man.  Hopefully there will be other accounts of Jobs' career as it seems that there is much more that could not be covered in the book's 600 pages.
B000PC0SPU|4.0|With A Whole New Mind, Mr. Pink is showing himself to be another Malcolm Gladwell: narrative non-fiction written in a very breezy, colloquial, yet effective style.  The book discusses the importance of right-brain thinking in today's society.  The prose is very straightforward and reads almost like an extended magazine article rather than a textbook or dry intellectual work.  Most people can probably knock this off in 3-4 sittings.  I won't go into an exhaustive discussion of content, as other reviewers have done that ad nauseum.  As a general description, Mr. Pink outlines specific right-brain qualities and why they are necessary for success.  A must read for educators, business people, and entrepreneurs, though anyone can gain insight from this book.  The first caveat is that some of the recommended exercises in the back of each chapter (the \\"portfolio\\") are way too New Age and over-the-top.  For example, he suggests trying a \\"laughing club\\" or walking through a labyrinth to help you seek \\"meaning.\\"  Secondly, the endnotes are not linked in the kindle version which is frustrating.  Despite these criticisms, this is an excellent read and highly recommended.
0061906220|5.0|This is a fun book for children - and adults!  As an educator, I know children would love the pictures and the catchy song.  Teachers would have fun with this book, too!
B0057DI0AC|2.0|The seller did not state you could not watch the DVD on US equipment. It said triple play, DVD Blue Ray digital. Fortunately I could download and watch the show on my laptop. It is a great documentary on Senna that would only be even better on a large screen. If it is available in US compatible format and you are a F1 fan buy it! Brought back memories of how much I despised Ballestrie and Prost, the glory of France instead of the glory of competition.

B005SZNZAY|5.0|I'm 26 and my first exposure to Chris Cornell was really the first Audioslave album. I was aware of the beast that is Soundgarden but the only time I'd actually heard them outside of black hole sun was through the soundtrack of the ever timeless Road Rash on Playstation 1.    They were noted as a band not to be f'd with on my list of well..... bands not to be f'd with. Soundgarden....the name struck a chord in my heart. They were forever embedded into my memory. I started checking out anything Chris Cornell related I could. I was an aspiring vocalist myself and he was something I always strove to be, a true soul on his sleeve musician. I soaked up everything I could get my hands on and it just wasn't enough.   Loved every single Soundgarden album, what raw powerful emotion in his vocals....the only person I could compare it to was the late great Layne Stayley. Loved the amazing song writing ability of the Cornell solo projects. Loved the ever groovy energy of the Audioslave albums but one thing became apparent...Chris had an alcohol problem. It effected live variations of practically every Audioslave performance I've seen. Scream was an excellent album. It wasn't the album any Chris Cornell fan were expecting but after hearing leaked versions of fully rocked out version who could deny it was Chris coming into his own. His vocal ability had started to come back. I shortly thereafter heard an album by Chris Cornell playing his tunes on Live In Sweden, the live completely acoustic bootleg album. This was the Chris I knew and expected.      Finally after all this time Chris Cornell has gotten sober and has recaptured, surpassed even, his vocal ability from the Soundgarden days and my personal favorite Live in Sweden album. It's the power we all knew but also the age and control one learns from years of performing and finally  sobriety. I can't help but smile while i hear new life being breathed into these classic songs and many of those classics are indeed included here.   I'm glad to say i was around to witness the birthing of one of the finest singers of our time. Long live Chris Cornell and here's to hoping he continues to improve throughout the years. This is truly his finest effort to date. Thank you....
B005KJZDXK|1.0|It's not easy to make a good Christmas album. If it isn't brilliant, it's miserable. This album is certainly not brilliant. Nothing grabs me about these songs. They aren't particularly heartfelt or reinvented. Listening to them every day at work has made work (I work at a nice clothing store, it's moderately enjoyable) almost impossible to bear.
B001E57SH8|1.0|I'm a big fan of Zippo lighters and I love butane lighters too, so I figured this was a perfect match.  First of all, I hate the feel of it.  It doesn't act like a Zippo and it feels cheap and rickety.  Turns out, it is.  It lasted a month.  The flint wheel (the thing you flick to light it) has locked up completely and it won't work at all... and it wasn't even cool when it did work.  This is going in the trash right now.  If you've got a high opinion of Zippo like I did, preserve it by not buying Zippo Blu ever.
B005TPCQ5I|1.0|2 hours of my life I won't get back, the film follows the tragic friendship-but-never-quite-relationship of Emma and Dex bouncing from the 1980's up to present day in 1-5 year steps.  The film just drags on and on with few light spots, only to end in tragedy.  What a waste of time!  Don't watch if you're hoping for a pick-me-up!

If you can find the VHS, go with that -- at least that is the complete movie.  Even when you rent this movie now, you get the DVD version, missing the scene.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Some like to revisit the film [[ASIN:B000HEWEJO It's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition)]] every Christmas season.  I like to return to this film and [[ASIN:B00005JMFQ Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)]].  They inspire a holiday spirit.  The premise of this movie is enticing: two young women swap homes (and lives) for a week.  The English cottage owner (Kate Winslet) and L.A. modern owner (Cameron Diaz) exchange homes and accompanying relatives/friends.  Haven't we all imagined trading our surroundings and lives for a time and trying on another for size? Look at our lives through a different lens?  The week transforms both women as they gain wisdom, perspective and a little romance.  This movie offers deep revelations with a light touch.  I think it will become a holiday classic.

B000069KGM|5.0|Despite the direction that Peter Cetera later took, this album features some of the fiercest bass playing that I've ever heard.  Cetera's playing on \\"Introduction\\" propels the song, much like Berry Oakley used to drive the Allman Brothers.    I haven't actually heard the digital remaster, but I've read some complaints.  FWIW, the original vinyl version is one of the best sounding albums in my collection; flawlessly arranged and recorded, sparely produced, it just flies out of the speakers.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|If you've ever dreamed of walking the streets of Paris, this film will enchant you.  It's a charming substitute.  Midnight in Paris takes you to modern Paris and then whisks you away to the Paris of the 1920's when American expatriot writers and artists lived there and mingled with the French creative class.  Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald are characters in this movie when the character, played by Owen Wilson, is transported to the Paris of the 1920's.   He realizes his modern me isn't living his heart's dream as a Hollywood playwright--he wants to write novels and stay in Paris and these characters convince him that he should listen to his heart. They fantasize about the past and the Belle Epoque in the way he fantasizes about the 1920's in Paris.  He realizes he needs to enjoy the present but live the way he wants to in the present. He should live the life of his imagining not convention.  Rachel McAdams is believable as the spoiled fiance and Wilson is perfect in his role as the dreamy, but engaging romantic.  It's a fun film, with gorgeous scenery, that makes you think about the life you want to lead.  I'd like to see it again, just for the scenery.  My 26-year-old son started watching it with me and stayed through the entire film.

I always liked stories of time travel and this one is great.At the very heart of this book, it is a love story, through and through. The time travel is just the means of telling a fantastic love story. The last chapter of the book made me feel so sorry for the charcter, but oh what an ending. It isn't very often that a book grabs you and makes you feel that way. I have'nt read all of Kings work, but of all the ones that I have read, this is now my favorite.

B005TZFZJC|2.0|I wanna start off by saying I absolutely loved her Rated R album, but ever since then her music has been going steadily downhill.<br />If you listen to Rated R and then Loud and this album, will you see all emotion and meaning has gone out the window in Riri's quest for number one singles. Its really a shame to see a talent like hers become so clearly commercial. Shes had many hit singles since the rated r album but they are all obvious attempts at hits and don't have any true substance behind the skanky lyrics and bombastic beats.<br />It seems she sold herself out just to keep hitting number one on the billboards charts which seem to be working. For example her latest single \\"We found love\\" is the current number one song in the country.<br />The lyrics are painfully generic and the beat sounds like every other dance song on the radio.<br />Rhianna has now become another face in the pop/dance crowd and has lost all traces of originality.<br />If she would stop trying so hard to fit in with Katy perry, Ke$ha and Lady Gaga crowd she be a stand out artist but as of now she doesn't stand out at all.

B0001NBMEE|5.0|I really enjoyed this colorful somewhat fanciful Medieval Romance Saga concerning Prince Valiant and his adventures concerning Camelot [Britain and Britainy] and Scandia [Scandinavia]. This movie wonderfully parallels both semi-realistic Medieval fantasy AND the bold-as-gold Prince Valiant comic series -- to double the fun -- or even triple the fun if the very colorful scenery, woods, seas, castles, knights and maidens are of course included. I found it doublely thrilling -- being both closer [than I expected] to Medieval history in customs, costumes and combat -- as well as fantastical comic-like just-so feats and events. The cliff-hanger plot twists and turns are great fun. While \\"Prince Valiant\\" is very colorful in bold colors -- it has plenty of grey and dark colors to add plenty of Dark Age Gothic aspects -- including some fine Medieval Vlllas, Chapels and CASTLES +++

0307454541|5.0|I first read THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO Christmas week of last year while in Illinois celebrating the holiday with my family. I wanted to see if Stieg Larsson's novel withstood the test of time; and it most certainly does! I had originally thought that the novel began slowly, but it is necessary that we get to know the \\"ruined\\" finance journalist, Mikael Blomkvist. His loss of the libel suit against the ultra rich financier, Hans-Erik Wennerstr&ouml;m is imperative to the main plot line to the book. If he had won the suit, Herr Henrik Vanger couldn't have gotten Blomkvist's interest in the disappearance of his niece decades ago. Facing a hefty fine, a leave of absence at Millennium Magazine, and a 3 month prison sentence, Blomkvist needs money and a flexible schedule.  Though intrigued by Herr Vanger's story about his missing niece, Harriet, and the fact that the old man has been receiving a framed single dried flower on his birthday Vanger clinches Blomkvist's services by promising the journalist ammunition to bring down Wennerstr&ouml;m.  Under the guise of writing the history of the once very prominent Swede family, Mikael begins the year long assignment.<br /><br />Blomkvist realizes that he needs help with his investigation and needs an assistant. Enter the very young looking waif, Lisbeth Salander. The 24 year-old with numerous piercings and tattoos (that includes a tattoo of a large dragon) has done her own investigation of Mikael Blomkvist. She is an egimia to all who know her, especially to her older employer at the Security firm. Her deep investigating tools are a photographic memory and that she is one of the world`s premier hackers. She has a story of her own that is revealed in the course of the novel and will dish out her own brand of justice to those she believes deserve it. This girl whom is a ward of the Swedish state abhors violence against women and more so against those individuals she allows herself to become close to her.  And there are many in the dysfunctional Vanger family who richly deserve her kind of justice.<br /><br />Larsson has created more than your typical crime novel; he has crafted a deliberate calibrated mystery with the suspense of a thriller with enough violence that a true thriller enthusiast enjoys. But the violence is not gratuitous. It has its place within the multilayered plotlines.  Unfortunately, violence against women has been happening since the morning of time, but Larsson brings a modern cautionary tale to the subject. Many reviewers have said THE GIRL WITH A DRAGON TATTOO is a great character study of flawed individuals, and it is true. We readers become enamored with some, cringe at others while ultimately caring for almost all of them.

B0060V1WJ6|2.0|How this move got any 4 and 5 star ratings I have no clue.  Typical Steve Carrell - funny for about 20 minutes and then trying to teach the audience a lesson for the rest of the movie.  Save your money and rent something else.

B0067QPVD2|4.0|When they announced that The Thing was getting a prequel, I thought 1: This is exactly the kind of movie that could use some special effects upgrades, and 2: That the atmosphere of tension and paranoia would be completely lost in the rehash. Fortunately, the effects are solid, and the atmosphere of \\"Who can I trust, who's infected?\\" is still very prevalent. Although the creature looks less of a random deformation, and more like the necromorphs from Dead Space, they still cause panic and fear effectively. This movie is, however, nearly an exact replica of the first one, which caused critics to latch on to the movie like piranhas. That isn't a bad thing, though, as the John Carpenter version was a masterpiece. It is an updated version of John Carpenter's, and is still an excellent movie.

It's like listening to a scarily perturbing monologue with depressing metal being played in the background. Anybody who plays any instrument of ANY kind, or even LISTENS to music of any kind, will hear this and throw it out the window. Yes, i am a metallica fan, and death magnetic got them back on track to the way they used to be.....then they come out with THIS???

0670022411|5.0|I am a Diana Gabaldon fan and adore historical fiction.  I'm not the type to go find a witch or vampire type book at all!  I've never read Twilight and I tried Harry Potter, but it wasn't for me. I will admit that I loved Anne Rice in the 80's and 90's, but that was a long time ago.<br />So, I picked up this book and immediately felt it was wrong for me. I even talked to my husband and told him that the book starts out letting the reader know that this will be a book about witches and vampires. I was going to bring it right back to the library until my daughter started throwing up with the stomach flu...I was forced to sit on the couch for a day helping her and staying with her as she dozed.  So, I picked up the book again.<br />What great luck that I was forced to revisit this gem!  I read most of the book in a matter of 3 days.  Mind you, I do work and was finishing up a major project-but I had to keep reading. I appreciated the character development, the dialogue, and the amazing twists in the plot. I especially enjoyed watching the romance aspect develop with a nice mix of sexual tension and passion. The real story wasn't about vampires and witches who suck blood and cast spells.  That was just the backdrop-although it did make the story so very interesting.<br />What a great fiction debut...I'm ready for the next books and I just hope she decides to make this more than a trilogy!
B006FE17Q6|5.0|No, no, I didn't cry a little bit when Sophia came out of the barn, honest, I was slicing an onion when I was watching it... yeah, that's what it was.  Now, let's talk about football and guns!  Yeah!  Seriously, that was a very wrenching scene - the bad part is, I've been watching these episodes after their air dates and had already had the plot \\"spoiled\\" somewhat by reading reviews/blogs after they aired, so I knew things didn't end well for the kid, but it still got to me.  That's a testimony to a well written and acted scene, right there.  A lot of people have mentioned the story moving more slowly this season as compared to the first, one obvious reason for that is that the writers chose to change the time compression for this season's story arc, I guess to make the search for Sophia span the full season (or half-season, or whatever the hell it is).  The six episodes of the first season covered an apparent period of a couple to several weeks, whereas season two's seven (so far) episodes covered only, what, five days or so of story time?

0307292134|1.0|Picked up the box set and was immediately enthralled by Game of Thrones - creative new world, diverse characters with unique POVs... great stuff.  But - do you remember as a kid when you read Lord of the Rings or another great fantasy or sci fi series?  The sadness that a beautiful world was suddenly snatched away from you?  (back to reality, ha).<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT THIS PARAGRAPH:  The darkness and nonredeemable aspects of the author's landscape are hinted at in book one... take root in book two... and pretty much dominate by book three.  I skimmed the 4th book only - not b/c it wasn't as well-written as the others - but b/c it was friggin' DEPRESSING to see all the characters basically destroyed in mind, body & spirit.  I guess if you look at humanity solely from the confines of a horrific event like the Holocaust (choose Germany, Rwanda, or Cambodia depending on your geo-ethnic bias) you could APPROACH the darkness of the world witnessed in books 3 & 4... and who finds this fun to read?  I know some people do - maybe the same folks who like watching ultra-violent horror movies.  Hey, it's freedom of press & speech for everyone so I'm not knocking all the fans who love this series.  I'm just saying... it ain't for me.<br /><br />Reading these books put me into the same frame of mind as if I'd played an ultra-violent video game or watched a depressing genocide documentary for a week straight... not something I enjoy.  Book one is very film adaptable, but I anticipate HBO will find it near impossible to convert the latter books into something people will continue watching.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|This is probably the best album I've ever heard. I cried ever time I heard 'So Far Away' for a week, and I listened to it a lot. 'God Hates Us' is absolutely insane, and 'Nightmare' needs no introduction.  You will be sorely missed, Jimmy. foRever.

B006ANJ4BW|3.0|Let's all just be honest.  The original Conan was not an Academy Award winner for Best Actor or Best Screen Play but that being said this one is even less so.  I still like this movie though.  I mean, I'm glad I didn't pay the #11.50 at AMC but it is good mindless action.
B0053JJLLC|1.0|Michael Crichton's contirbution to this book is the two and a half page introduction, and the central idea.  This is a Richard Preston novel - and its not very good. Preston is a fine writer in his own right - it seems he was trying to write in Crichton's style and he couldn't pull it off.  The book is really poorly written, almost embarassingly so, I found myself shaking my head at most of the passages.  Chrichton's  estate should request a new book cover listing Preston as the author, no way should Crichton be associated with this novel
0307888681|4.0|I found this book to be a great read, especially at night before bed. I read this book while I was deployed and honestly it gave me nightmares, as lame as that sounds it did, then again the only movies and or books that scare me are ones associated with zombies. Only reason I gave it a four star is because of how it bounced around a lot. I do understand the book is a big interview with a bunch of survivors and there stories but sometimes I would get lost. Overall though, great book!
0307352145|5.0|This book gives readers a peek into what is happening in our society today.  \\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking\\" discusses our recent journey from our society of Culture of Character into  our world of Culture of Personality.  Author Susan Cain talks about all the qualities of the introvert that are being, not only ignored but looked upon as unwanted qualities today.<br /><br />She reminds us that the world would be devoid of:<br /><br />The theories of gravity and relativity (Newton and Einstein)<br />W. B. Yeat's \\"The Second Coming\\"<br />Chopin's nocturnes<br />Proust's \\"In Search of Lost time\\"<br />Peter Pan (J.M.

B004QIG7CW|5.0|Yes, a great fun movie but it's been available since May 2011 and it's neatly Christmas; so where's the Blu Ray version?  If anyone out there knows or is connected let me know if there are plans to release it or if its in the works as I have a six year old who desperately wants it on Blu!  Did Disney forget or are they gearing up for a Directors Cut double dip?
B005OUB7MQ|4.0|After the success of her last album, I was both excited about the release of \\"Metals\\" but feeling a bit tentative as well.  Natalie Merchant (whom I had adored since her first album with 10,000 maniacs), put out two excellent albums (with \\"Ophelia\\"- her second release- being her best IMO) and, after a break, came back with a hugely disappointing \\"Motherland.\\"  Would the same fate befall Feist?  Fortunately, the answer is a resounding \\"No!\\"  Metals is a great album and, having just listened to \\"Let It Die,\\" \\"The Reminder,\\" and \\"Metals\\" back to back, I think that \\"Metals\\" is, by far, the best of the bunch.  5 stars should be very difficult to earn so I give it four if, for no other reason, there is something about the chorus in the song \\"A Commotion\\" that gets under my skin.  However, I can't get enough of \\"The Bad in Each Other,\\"Graveyard,\\" \\"How Come You Never Go There,\\" \\"Undiscovered First,\\" and \\"Comfort Me\\"- shoot, the whole album is good.
B000JIHP88|1.0|I bought this mobile, and we assembly all the parts with the batteries and it doesn't work. Also we read all the instructions, and we wrote an email to fisher price costumer service. Bad product, we don't recommended.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This was one of my favorite series ever and it's so enjoyable to watch it again (and own it.) I really like the way the collection is boxed with separate cardboard envelopes for each season. There is a great episode guide and also the script of the pilot show. So glad I bought this!
B001UV4XWY|4.0|Ignore the bad ratings. This is a thinking man's sci-fi flick. Based on a short-story, the tale involves extraterrestrials, afterworlds and a quite a lof of unexplained mysteries. I thought the acting here was better than many reviewers say. Cameron Diaz is not bad at all as the mother who decides to push the button to gain a million dollars at the expense of a stranger's life somewhere. Naturally, that comes to no good. I liked the spooky score. I was struck that this is really just a 1950s b-movie dressed up in modern guise, while set in 1976. Well worth the watch.
B006H53KV8|5.0|MY HEART is the 29th original album from the GRAMMY award-winning singer Doris Day. It features PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED song material which Doris cut after a brief return to the recording studio during the mid-1980s.   These sessions took place after Doris Day's late son Terry Melcher convinced his dear Mom to return to the recording studio under his guise. Six of the new songs contained on MY HEART originate from these very sessions. Although a few of the recordings were aired during the eighties on the star's American chat show, \\"Doris Day's Best Friends\\", the majority were left in an \\"unfinished\\" state until they were polished and perfected by the multi-platinum selling British producer Ted Carfrae who recorded additional orchestrations to complete the songs.  Doris was fully involved in the music selections for MY HEART which is notably her first original album for over 17 years (the last being \\"[[ASIN:B000CS45PG Love Album]]\\"). As well as the eighties recordings there is also a studio recording taken from one of Day's 1970s US TV specials plus a trio of other Doris Day classics lifted from the vaults at Columbia - each of these were hand picked by the star for sentimental reasons. The album is dedicated to the memory of Ms. Day's son Terry Melcher.  In September 2011, the MY HEART album was released in the UK where it rocketed into the UK album chart at #9. As a result of its runaway success Doris Day became the oldest singer in UK chart history to have a TOP 10 hit with an album of new material. Although initially only available throughout Europe MY HEART is now available across the singer's home country of the USA thanks to her own label Arwin Productions. Better still for the \\"US edition\\" Doris added an exclusive bonus track STEWBALL - a duet with her son.  The MY HEART album packs a truly powerful punch on an emotional level as not only does it deliver some truly unforgettable vocal performances - such as YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL which will not leave a dry eye inthe house - but we are also all reminded from this album just how much we have missed Doris Day's voice and her music over the years she has been away!  This is a DAY-lightful comeback album (better late than never) and here's hoping if her American fans support it as much as her British ones did it will make a piece of pop history on the American BILLBOARD chart. Better still proceeds from sales of this album go to help the Doris Day Animal Foundation. So buy, buy, buy folks as it's all helping a wonderful cause!  Talking of helping the animals a [[ASIN:B005NZ175O Doris Day 2012 Wall Calendar]] is also available now and again proceeds from sales benefit the star's animal organisation.
0393064476|3.0|This was an easy to read erudite book regarding the 1400's florentine scholar Poggio de Bracciolini, his dogged love for ancient latin literature that led him in search of classical texts abandoned in medieval  monasteries; the miracle that it was to find Lucretius poem \\"De Rerum Naturae\\" in an old German library and  the even greater miracle that it was to rescue it from the tides of time and  the turmoil of History. It was an uneasy  life that of the Renaissance with its  wars, plagues, the papacy and religious turmoil.    The influence of the poem in what is considered mainstream thought today-even though I am not sure it is as mainstream outside scientific and cultural circles as the author Mr. Greenblatt seems to assume- is what prompted the author to gush about  this little known chapter of scholarly history. He sees its influence in Thomas More (who tried to apply epicurean principles to a christian world view in his \\"Utopia\\") , Erasmus, Giordano Bruno, Shakespeare,  T. Jefferson and A. Einstein among others.  I think the author is right in assuming we live in a more epicurean society today but by far I think most of us are quite ensnared by other dogmas and thought shackles that might not be of religious nature per-se (Justin Bieber anyone? ) but are just as magical and superstitious.   The author also identifies the inner sorrow of  the scholars who pursued relief from the sordid world they endured  with the balm of their quest for ancient latin texts, a remnant of the grandeur of Rome, stripped even then of its stones and ambitions. But again, I think Mr. Greenblatt is depicting a bit of a flat picture with very little nuance beyond corrupt prelates, ignorant masses  and beleaguered scholars. I am sure, there were other avenues and works going on that would have made the reinassance the splendid period it was.   I also found interesting how the author mentions the many occasions in which the poem's incendiary message  was protected by the beauty of its language; to the point that most scribes and translators claimed to look upon it while dismissing  its content but fascinated by its beauty ( a claim meant to protect them from the Inquisition naturally).I would have liked to see more explanation on that point, more samples of the actual poem.     Epicurus was the founder of a doctrine of pleasure seekers in ancient Greece . Some Roman scholars had embraced its tenets as epicureans themselves. The Middle Ages saw the decline of some philosophical freedoms as ,over time, the Catholic Church had  taken upon itself to root out, mold and regulate  any idea that might threaten its dogma and its power. Paradoxically, monasteries were the last refuge of the  ancient classical texts sought by Poggio and  his competitors. Lucretius poem delivered the philosophical  ideal of Epicureanism and saw the light anew when such an ideal was tantamount to blasphemy. Sensible religious men perished at the stake  (jan Hus, Jerome of Prague) for crimes much milder than embracing epicurean doctrine.     The poem was leaps and bounds beyond , it  hinted at a time and a way of life that could ignore the Gods altogether or assume that, if they existed, they would care nothing for human affairs. The dedication of the poem to Venus just indicates that Lucretius saw the world as in constant erotic tension, a resplendent self-regulated chaos  where the ultimate goal is to find pleasure and avoid fear,  even pain. The poem paints a world where everything is in constant change, where the universe was not created , furthermore, it was not created for us . Its building blocks are \\"atomi\\" or minuscule particles. Its philosophy accepts there is no reward or punishment after death and that all we have is our time allotted to live. Far from being a pessimistic message that would induce everyone to just seek pleasure with no regards for others, it hints at a way of proper living in which the ultimate pleasures are obtained from the common happiness of all and the dismissal of magical thinking, superstition and useless grief. I am not going to attempt to explain Epicureanism in my review , suffice it to say , it has an appealing common sense to it.   In general, the book was well written and entertaining. In some areas it has a bit too much of the salacious anecdote and exaggerated claiming  typical of any book that wants to be in a best-seller list today but I din't mind that. It is part of the pleasure of reading.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Coming from the land of fruit based tablets I'm surprised there aren't more good weather apps but I think it is just too soon to judge too harshly. This one is good just not as flashy as many, but it is certainly worth the price to avoid ads.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|I cannot believe that there have been negative reviews of this film.  It was your classic Steven Spielberg production, a combination of Stand By Me and ET.  A group of middle school friends are making a zombie movie when strange things start to happen, including a massive train crash, the arrival of the U.S. military in town, and of course space creatures.  The main character recently lost his mother in a tragic accident at the local factory.  He has a massive crush on Elle Fanning's character.  They are both the kids of single dads and will eventually discover that they share a deeper bond.  It's a very sweet romance, and the relationship among the friends is also very credible.  It takes your formulaic plot and turns it into something fresh, sweet, and at times funny.  Much better and more authentic than all the Transformer movies combined!  The kids' making of the zombie movie and what goes into the production adds a somewhat autobiographical touch to the film.  I loved it.
1451648537|5.0|This is a brilliant account of a 20th. Century genius. Especially if you happened to purchase the first Macintosh back in 1985. Prior to the macintosh there was nothing but a laborious box with extremely difficult software (DOS). The Macintosh changed everything and in 1985 it was exciting times.I did not realise how much influence Steve Jobs had in the creation of the Macintosh untill i read this book.

0316042994|5.0|\\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is about a family and their religious beliefs, viewed from without, as every family and faith must be if they are to be viewed at all.  The narrator is, by turns, the friend of one sibling and the lover of another, but neither his affection nor his concern can grant him passage to the haunted chambers of the Brideshead mansion or guide him through the tortured relations its corridors resemble. It is a book about belief and religion, grace and wealth, eros and convention, culture and aristocracy--hence, the good and its shadow. Along with Greene's \\"The End of the Affair,\\" this is one of the English-speaking world's classic fictional meditations on the hold religious belief exercises on the human heart, regardless of the passions that pull it in other directions.  What sets Waugh apart (along with the likes of Joyce and McCarthy) from other great novelists is the sheer beauty of his prose.  Reading the first few pages never fails to move me to tears, and I don't know exactly why. But even the sound of the words in my mind is like the linguistic equivalent of a chocolate truffle, melting before you can savor it. Waugh writes like John Singer Sargent paints--with exquisite attention to every brushstroke--so that's it's not just the cumulative effect of the ideas which moves you, but the words and sentences themselves, as if the profundity of the story somehow overflows its bounds to leak back into every word with which it is told.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Saw them on Dancing with the Stars and immediately fell in love with one particular track just had to have it. Rest of CD has not let me down its fantastic. Would highly recommend to anyone a joy from start to finish.    Enjoy listening, download just one track and give it a go, you will be hooked
0425166805|4.0|So if you were like me and had been watching Ancient Aliens this book is something that gives you a little bit of a deeper look than just the television show. Erik Von Daniken discusses some of the mysteries involved in our planet. I really enjoyed the book and suggest it to anyone that likes the show.  Do not buy this in a book store, they will charge you too much for it.

0525423281|5.0|When I first read Anna and the French Kiss I didn't think any other books could come close but the Stephanie Perkin's sophomore novel was released and it was like Anna all over again. At first I didn't know if I was going to be able to connect to Lola like I did Anna but of course was I got going I couldn't put the book down. I loved the character of Cricket and it would have been impossible not to root for his \\"adorkable\\" character. I was also pretty happy to see Anna and St.Clair in this book as well. Just like Anna this one left me smiling at the end and I can't wait for her next novel.
1451627289|5.0|I first read King when he and I were both still able to qualify as sweet, young things.  Young enough, in fact, that when I read one of his earliest novels - \\"Salem's Lot\\" - I was tucked up in a hospital bed after the birth of my oldest daughter, who is now grown and bringing up kids of her own.  I can honestly say it was the only book that ever scared me enough to keep me awake - and convince me that hospitals are spooky places at night.  Since that time, I've read most of his work, although not all.  And I've liked a lot of his stories, disliked a few of them, and fallen in love with a fair number.  I was nineteen years old on that fateful day in Dallas, and it lives with me still.  I can still recall the ice that formed in my heart when the radio announcement came on.  I can still remember what I was doing and who was there, and - above all - I can still remember the comment made by a woman who was a co-worker, but not a friend, and - after this occasion - never would be.  I won't repeat it here, but suffice to say I lived in the deep South, where JFK was NOT well-loved, and I have never again been as repulsed as when I heard what she said; my blood literally ran cold.  I was afraid this book might overlook that horrendous trauma, might make light of it and make all of us who were traumatized by the events of that day feel foolish.  It didn't.  After reading it (and taking it with the grain of salt that King himself recommends) I find that he's actually managed to do something I didn't think anyone would ever do.  He's settled my mind, at least enough to allow me to realize that the detailed truth may never be available to me (although rumor has it that the whole story will be told once everyone who might have been a part of those events is dead).  That pretty much leaves me out of it.  But I can finally conclude that Oswald probably WAS the lone assassin, even though others might have contributed to his madness.  As the old saying goes, sometimes a cigar is justa cigar, and Mr. King has provided sufficient documentation and imagination to allow me to accept that conclusion.  Of course, the fact that his writing is still like perfect music, demonstrating - above all - his adoration of the English language, makes it an easy, un-put-down-able read. It's amazing how quickly 800+ pages can go by when you're rapt and enchanted.  Thank you, Mr. King.  If this were the only manuscript residing on my Kindle, it would still be worth every dime.  Cyn
B005DZMQ5Y|3.0|Dream Theater is back and there are some good tracks on this album but unfortunately the vinyl mix/mastering isn't worth $30.  sounds like it was sourced from 44.1 wav files, it's like listening to a CD. on a good note the vinyl is quiet like a CD.  other technical stuff... the mix also has odd average volume level jumps at times, it is compressed/limited but not to distortion and most surprisingly in this age of the loudness war there are some quiet passages.    final word - avoid the vinyl at $30 - get the CD or download it instead.
B0054R0QFI|5.0|this is a great book in any version. A story with a few sad parts but many great surprises like Amy and luary getting maried but its not to mushy. Great book for ten to eleven year pld girls. If you read this make sure to read little men too.
1609611543|4.0|I took this book out of the library, and am glad I didn't spend any money on it. I already eat Paleo, so I didn't need to be told not to eat wheat. I can sum it up in one sentence: Don't eat wheat, it'll kill ya. The reason I gave this book 4 stars, is because the information in it is SO important. The USDA et al has been \\"Feeding\\" the American people misinformation for decades. For people that have not already made the decision to go wheat free, this book is key. There are a lot of the scientific whys contained herein, which are dry, boring and well, scientific; I ended up skimming those sections. The best parts of the book in my mind are the case studies where the author tells his patients to go wheat free and they lose a ton of weight and cure themselves. This book could save America if it was required reading in Middle School. Too bad that will never happen.
0439023513|4.0|Let me start out by saying that I read the reviews (good and bad, mostly bad though) before I actually read the book. To read all the negative reviews was very disappointing and discouraging. I developed a hatred for Mockingjay without even having read it yet! I am very serious, I debated over several weeks whether or not to just go ahead and read it, taking the risk that it might ruin the whole series for me (which the last 2 books were so beautifully written).  Well I read it, and I really do like it,I definitely don't hate or regret it. Never judge a book by its reviews lol.   I guess I'll start with the negatives:  1. Katniss gets knocked out way too much! Just when the scene is developing it's like BANG! She's either been shot, almost choked to death, literally on fire, or forcefully sedated. Even interferes in the deaths of those she loves  2. The deaths. Neither Katniss nor the readers are allowed a time for grievance unlike the previous books. Why is it that we feel so much more hurt over Rue's death than Prim's? Rue's death scene was moving and tear-jerking, even though we could see it coming. Prim's death was unexpected and it gets lost in the next page of Katniss' rambling about being on fire. Rue was someone who became Katniss' ally for a few days . Prim was Katniss' sister, the one she put up her own life for, the one she kept thinking about during the games, the one she's fought so long to keep alive. And then she's gone like that and I didn't feel anything. I am not saying Rue was not important, she was one of my favorite characters and probably one of the best scenes in the whole series, but just that Prim's death seems so off in this book compared to Rue's. And then Finnicks death and Boggs who I was just starting to really like, it's like poof gone! The end.  3. I hate to admit it but the whole Katniss love triangle gets played out by this 3rd book. I know your in the middle of crazy war confused and all but seriously, still trying to decide who your in love with? Really throughout the book Katniss is unfair to both Gale and Peeta, she really deserves to end up alone.  Ok the good of it all, the perfect pieces:  1. It's realistic if you really think about it. I think that was the problem for most people. The general population want happy stories and happy endings. As the reader we aren't really left with a \\"This is how it goes\\" ending. It's left up to us to decide. Is Katniss really happy? Has she lost her mind? Is she just living, but not really alive? What I was able to get out of it was that, Katniss nor Peeta nor anyone else who survived the wars will ever be the same. She's gone on with her life. I don't necessarily thinks she's happy with it but that she's at peace with it. She has someone who understands her, understands what she's been through and why she is the way she is. She has kids that won't have to compete in a cruel hunger games. Katniss ends up a lot better than she thought she would. She's making the best of her life even if it is unstable and broken, but she's making it.  2. Peeta. No matter how crazy and nutty he gets you can't help but love and feel sorry for him. But that's probably thanks to HG and Catching Fire. Even in an \\"hijacked\\" state of mind he's impossible to hate. Which makes you kind of turn on Katniss for getting so upset with him.   3. The underlying message of it all. No this story wasn't all about war but more than that. The book forces us to question ourselves in the same situations, or that's at least what it made me do.  Would I sacrifice my life for a loved one? For humanity?  What's really right? And who decides when it becomes wrong, when it's gone too far? Would you do something almost inhumane for the good of the world, if it meant defeating your enemies?(Dropping the bombs on the Capitol's children, the Hunger Games itself, making a final Hunger Game for the Capitol's children even though a huge reason for the uprising was to end the games, blowing up a mountain with your own allies in it just to get rid of your enemies, the torturing of the glam team for stealing bread)  What would you do through all this? Many of us would probably end up on morphling like Katniss, or fighters for the cause by any means necessary like Gale, losing who we are in the inside. Or maybe we might end up like Peeta (before he was hijacked) showing the Capitol that they haven't changed me or who I am. I hope I'd end up the latter. But who really knows until you find yourself in that situation.
0938045695|3.0|I took this book out of the library, so I was very satisfied with the price I paid. I am a CrossFit coach, and I love kettlebells. I was looking for valuable information that I could bring to my CrossFit classes. I didn't find much in here, but it was still worth reading, especially for free. I would have been disappointed had I paid full freight for it. There is some humor in the book that I enjoyed. Some reviewers were annoyed at the constant references to the author being Russian, I thought it was funny.<br /><br />There are not a lot of exercises in the book. He emphasizes two main exercises: Kettelbell Swings, and (Turkish) Get Ups. I was already familiar with both of these. There are a few others, the Halo, which was new to me, the Clean & Press and the Snatch. The latter are specifically for Kettlebells (duh) as opposed to the Oly lifts done with barbells. These also were not new to me, but I found the info on them helpful.<br /><br />There are some other inspirational and useful tidbits, like the CIA test. In the end, I can't see doing only kettlebells for one's workout routine, and also can't imagine CrossFit without kettlebells. You'll have to decide for yourself it it's worth the price. There is of course a lot of information on kettlebells available for free on the internet. Nostrovia!

B001EJIMUG|1.0|I found this movie to be so disjointed, very hard to truly understand what the main characters (Anne and Wentworth) were really thinking. Some scenes just did not make sense...almost as if some part of the story was missing. I can count the number of scenes with Anne and Wentworth together and worst still, in the few scenes where they did appear together, they barely spoke to each other, until the tail end of the movie. If we (the audience) were to gain some inkling of their feelings from their body language during these scarce occasions, then that too was sorely lacking. I have not read the book yet but I am a great fan of the author. This adaptation left me with a bad taste and no longer wanting to read the book. If it were not for the several reviews I've read about what the book is supposed to be about, and the praise in such reviews, I'd have just resigned to being perhaps the only Jane Austen fan who never read Persuasion. I don't think this adaptation truly conveyed the essence of the story and indeed, I was very disappointed with this particular adaptation.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I was drawn to this album by the cover, and the fact that Metallica was a part of it - then I had a listen. Is there a place I can bring it back that will pay me for the moments of life I lost while listening to this rot? Honestly, I don't even think inebriation would make it a decent album. Do yourself a favor and purchase something that won't kill your dreams.
1451648537|5.0|So, Odd Jobs kicked the bucket! This Syrian Arab-American, with his Muslim-like cruelty in the way he treated his terrified employees, has been finally told to Shut Up!<br /><br />The book describes Jobs' early beginnings when his bio-father, a Syrian Arab, decided he was not worth keeping & put him up for adoption. Jobs never recovered from this act of being discarded. It affected his psyche for the rest of his life. He never forgave his Arab father either and refused to ever meet with him. Jobs was driven all his life to prove he was not worthless and he ran roughshod over anyone who got in the way of his achieving this goal.<br /><br />His first stroke of luck was to meet his friend Woz, who was technically a very competent hardware designer. Woz designed a motherboard which impressed Jobs. They decided to put the board into a box and call it the Apple II. They formed a partnership which lasted a lifetime. Jobs never cheated Woz the way Paul Allen said that Willy Gates cheated him. The Apple II was not much of a machine. The IBM PC was clearly superior.<br /><br />Jobs next started developing a desktop computer called the Mac. The Mac used the 68000 processor which was considered inferior to the Intel 8080 series. Jobs insisted in packaging the Mac in a curvy box with specially selected colors. He gave the machine an effeminate appearance. Since it did not use the Intel processor, it was never adopted by industry and did not sell well.<br /><br />Isaacson describes how Jobs was abandoned by his bio-father and how Jobs, in his turn, abandoned his own illegitimate daughter and did not show any love for her for the first 10 years of her life. Jobs' reptilian coldness towards this poor child, who never asked to be born, was grossly repulsive and unforgivable. His relationship to his two marital daughters was also lacking in warmth and love. The only person he wished to spend time with was his son Reed whom he loved very much.<br /><br />The development of the Mac was greatly delayed by the constant interference by Jobs in the hardware and software design process. Sales lagged and finally Jobs decided he needed to hire someone with organizational capability to straighten out the mess. He hired John Sculley who had an important position at Pepsico. Clearly this was a mistake since Pepsico has no connection to the electronics industry. After a couple of years Sculley convinced the Board of Directors to fire Jobs which they were happy to do.<br /><br />Some time passed during which Jobs connected with Disney to form a company called Pixar, which produced cartoon movies. During this time, Apple's performance deteriorated under Sculley's leadership and Jobs was asked to return to the company. From 1995 until this point, the Apple common stock had been in a coma. But in 2005, Jobs asked his engineers to improve on existing music players and to come out with the iPod. This was a big success and the stock started to rise. Next came the iPhone which was an improvement on existing cell phones. This device also sold well. These products were the result of the intelligence of the Apple engineers. Jobs contributed nothing except to have screaming sessions followed by extended sobbing about how the colors of the machine tools in the factory were not pretty and that there were not enough curves in the box containing the iPod and iPhone. The only reason that these very competent engineers tolerated this unpleasant verbal abuse and the autistic staring into the eyes of the individual being abused was - stock options. Many Apple employees became wealthy.<br /><br />The author describes frequently the neurotic beliefs of Jobs - his belief in Zen - the many trips to India to sit at the feet of some smelly snake-charmer and ask questions about how to live his life. Jobs absorbed all this nonsense and frequently fasted and ate weird vegan food products. One of the jokes told in the book describes the wish of guests invited to dinner at the Jobs homethat, when they leave, after dinner, they can find a restaurant open.<br /><br />The author describes the contempt that Jobs had for Willy Gates and Steve Balmer and Microsoft. He said that Gates stole all the ideas used in its product line. He said Gates never invented anything and that Microsoft would never be a great company again as long as Balmer was at the controls. He said that Gates is better suited to philanthropy than business.<br /><br />At some point, Jobs went for a MRI checkup and the doctor discovered a shadow on his pancreas. The doctor recommended immediate surgery to remove the cancer before it metastasized. Jobs, stuffed to the eyebrows with Zen nonsense, said \\"No, I do not want my body to be opened\\". Incredibly, he foolishly allowed nine months to go by before he had the surgery, despite his family and friends begging him to switch on his brain and do the right thing. By then the cancer had spread to his liver. He required a liver transplant, which he was able to get thanks to the private jet plane Apple gave him to play with.<br /><br />During the final years, Jobs worked hard improving products, starting the iStore & other activities that might take his mind off the pain he was suffering. He still continued to fast and eat strange foods. He still continued to interrupt his conversation and stare at people without speaking if they disagreed with him. He argued with his doctors and dismissed their opinions in a typically arrogant way. Eventually, things got to the point where he stayed in bed all day. He passed away surrounded by his family.n.

1597801585|4.0|This book is written beautifully with an air of gritty, honest truth that lends reality to the bleak, tense, terror-stricken mood of the dying world it describes. Sometimes it gets a little lost in its lingo for me since the author doesn't hand-feed you every detail so you get thrown in with a mild understanding of the big picture but have to struggle just as much as the characters to find out what exactly is going on, and uncover a little bit at a time the truth of the past and what led up to these events. The characters are all sympathetic, even the ones you learn to hate, in the battle for survival that pits human against human, Yellow Card against Thai, White Shirt against Windups... And you aren't sure who is going to win as you turn each page with bated breath.

0439023491|5.0|I thought book one, Hunger Games was an emotional rollercoater but book two had me on pins and needles. It reminds me of how life is unfair and full of hardships. However, we can find hope in small things such as Mockingjays to continue to persevere. Katniss Everdeen survived the 74th Hunger Games with supposed love interest Peeta. However, the Government, President Snow is enraged because Katniss symbolizes rebellion against the government. Her conduct during the 74th Hunger Games has now encouraged citezins of Panem to take a stand against the Capitol (the government). To prevent such upheaval, President Snow threatens Katniss by planning to hurt the people she loves. In addition, President Snow throws past winners of the Hunger Games including Katniss and Peeta back into the Game for the 75th Hunger Game. As I read, I don't want Katniss to make friends because we know like book one, there really can only be one winner. And I know this time Katniss and Peeta may not make it out alive together. I love Peeta and wish Katniss realized she loved Peeta too. This book is rivoting and another tear jerker. I hold this series in high regard as I do the Harry Potter series. Suzanne Collins has one heck of an imagination. I cannot wait to read Book 3.

0439023521|5.0|This book requires open-mindness and imagination. A book about revolution, strength, and survival of the fittest. Katniss Everdeen, the main character, volunteers herself to take her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games. A game designed for twenty four players to play and only one will win the game. In order for there to be one winner, the players will have to use their survival instincts, wits, pain endurance and strengths to kill others to be the surviving winner. This game was created by the Government to discourage its citezins to revolt against it. However, Katniss did not expect to find allies and an ally who is a love interest who she may eventually have to kill or be killed by. Through out the book,citezins watching the Hunger Games are encouraged by Katness not to continue to be subjected to the cruelties that the goverment inflicts upon them. With this being said, I could not put this book down.At the same time it took me on an emotional rollercoater of feelings ranging from nervousness, anger, and sadness. How this author thought of such plot,amazes me. This is a great book for all ages.

Eugene Sledge gives a very accurate portrayal of the difficulties he had while serving with the Marines during the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa while with the 1st Marine Division. He adequately writes about the struggles we had with both the Japanese troops and the mud during the rainy season on Okinawa. I also read Sledge's story about his time served in North China following WW2. A worthwile read about a young man from Georgia who dropped out of college to enlist in the Marines for the war in the Pacific during WW2. I recommend books from Amazon.

0307593312|5.0|This is my first Murakami novel and now I'm a devotee. I'm always looking for a long-enough book and this one was! and it was well-reviewed enough to convince me to buy. I'm glad I did...Murakami's style is poetic as well as engagingly narrative. I was committed right away to the characters who at the same time were everyday and mystical. Like many people, I'm often puzzled about the interplay of story, magic, and reality, and Murakami plays out these themes irresistibly.
B004AYCWY4|4.0|Bookmarks begins its review of this book by saying: \\"'Like a detective reconstructing a crime' (San Francisco Chronicle), Dawkins amasses a mountain of evidence in this richly illustrated, enormously readable explanation of the theory of evolution.\\" This book is Dawkins' effort to lay out the evidence for evolution. His target is the \\"intelligent design\\" approach to explaining why species end up as they are--explicitly rejecting Darwinian evolutionary theory.<br /><br />The book features many fascinating examples of evolution in action--including demonstrating that many species do NOT exhibit anything like intelligent design. His description of the wacky nerve structure of giraffes shows the willy nilly nature of evolution--and is certainly not consistent with the concept of intelligent design.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with other of Dawkins' works will not be surprised at what a nice read this book is. The author does write well and is persuasive throughout the book. However, those who believe in intelligent design are not apt to accept his arguments.<br /><br />For those who wish to get a sense of the logic of and evidence for evolution, this is a good starting point.

Pros:   - Very Lightweight  - Simple form factor  - Attaches well to Kindle  - Protects my Kindle  Cons:  - The stand is a little flimsy  - Not a fan of the elastic strap (but it serves its purpose well)  - Inside fabric is a magnet for lint  Overall, its a worthwhile investment to protect my Kindle, and you wont be disappointed!

The images speak for themselves and are of a caliber ranked with Cartier-Bresson and other giants of the 20th century. Some argue about the quality of the book's printing and layout. In my opinion, the work is what is important and the publishing  quality is competent. The book is a gem !

0307593312|5.0|Caution:  story spoilers in review<br /><br />Okay, I have read a few of the reviews for this book, 1Q84 and find them interesting and thought provoking. While reading this book, I kept thinking, \\"The style of this author reminds me of another book I read.\\" Yes, \\"The Wind-up Bird Chronicle\\" was the book that kept creeping into my memory.  Until the dots connected, I thought that maybe this was the way all great Japanese literature is written.<br /><br />So what made me love this novel so much?  Well first of all, I love unique story lines that push limits.  Secondly, stories written by authors outside of the US that portray life outside the US (even mundane life) fascinate me.  Third, Murikama's writing style is captivating.  Finally, while reading this book, I kept wanting to get back to the book in place of working, socializing, exercising, and essentially trying to live life outside of the novel.  Hmmm, I think the term is hyper-focus.  I was hyper-focused on this book.  Now add that to the fact that the book is still sticking with me as I ponder loose ends of the story and the story in general.<br /><br />Parts of the book kept exiting and appearing in my life at weird times and strange ways.  Emails with subject line of \\"little people\\" that dealt with marketing aspects of my job.  A dog hair ball floating around my house that looked like air chrysalis. While reading this book, I found myself interfacing with people talking cryptically like Fukaeri. I was actually waiting for a NHK worker to knock on my door.  LOL<br /><br />Yes, parts of this book drag.  As a reader you have the power to scan those pages.  Yes this book seems long and I felt as reading it that this book would make a great series/trilogy.  After reading this book, I feel the author could follow Tengo and Aomame in the new dimension they are in....surely this is not the original dimension they are from since the Esso tiger was located on the wrong side of the sign.<br /><br />Yes, the author does focus on the mundane--such as cooking specifics, menial conversations and boring day-to-day activities but I found that enlightening about life in Japan on a daily basis.  To me how people around the world live their life is fascinating.<br /><br />Yes, the main characters are flat.  However I loved this and thought that the author planned this to demonstrate that the average Joe is flat.  I wish I could say that if someone invented me in a novel that I would be fascinating and dynamic but in reality the average person is simply just an average person.  Boring, with redemptive qualities.<br /><br />Fantasy--I love how the author presented a fantasy situation in another dimension.  The little people fascinated me.  I wanted to know more about them but the author wasn't going to share everything.  I am still not clear about why Komatsu's hair was used in the chrysalis at the end of the book.  Is this fodder for the next book?<br /><br />Sex is huge in this book and I feel that it is well-written while pushing limits.  Both Aomame and Tengo engaged in what many would call unsafe sex:  sex with a married woman and in Aomame's case sex with strange men she picks up.  I think this is essential to the plot because they are each comfortable with their sexual choices and it never crosses their minds that what they are doing is inappropriate.  Once their characters develop in the book and their final goal to find each other becomes apparent do these two leave their unsafe sexual practices.<br /><br />This book reminded me of an American novel I read long ago and loved, \\"Winter's Tale\\" by Mark Helprin.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Someone wrote about Life as We Knew it, by Susan  Pfeffer below, and I totally agree about the two. You can't put this book down! They both make you feel this sense of distress about everyday life. Katniss is a strong young woman that just makes you shiver with delight when you know something else about her. This book and the whole trilogy took me in and I couldn't stop! I read all three in a matter of days and I'm now re-reading them. They made me cry, laugh, and then brutally yell at the not-so-nice characters. This book makes you question who each character really is. You always rest assured though that they are who you think in the beginning after the climax of each stressful part. WORTH YOUR MONEY AND TIME!  You won't be disappointed!  And you definitely won't stop reading!  Also, at first I hated the book because it was so depressing. But that's why you can't put it down! You want to see how it turns out. You can't bare to 'leave' the characters behind!

0321704452|4.0|In \\"The Naked Presenter - Delivering Powerful Presentations With or Without Slides\\" by Garr Reynolds, there were many key points, ideas, and suggestions to help Presenters give better presentations. The basis of the book was to \\"be naked\\" in your presentations, which means to be real, honest, sincere, and to be free, direct, simple, passionate, as well as to be without barriers; but more importantly, it emphasized \\"connecting and engaging with an audience\\".   Chapter one of the book mentions a Japanese phrase \\"Hadaka no tsukiai, which means naked relationship and communication\\". The book elaborates on \\"Hadaka no tsukiai\\" in relation to the Japanese bath, which is a way of life and ritual to promote \\"healthy communication and good relationships\\".   The contributing speakers and/or authors all agreed with this, and suggested several ways to assist you be \\"naked\\". \\"The Naked Presenter\\" addresses preparation, removing barriers, engaging with the audience, being simple, leaving the audience with positive impressions and memorable information, as well as feeling good about your true self during and after the presentations.  Reynolds describes methods to become \\"naked\\" or better presenters. Some of these methods include proper tone pitch, rate of talk or speech, narrowing down your subject, utilizing story-telling, emotions, proximity to the audience, interacting with the audience, eye contact, and rehearsing instead of memorizing your presentation. In regards to Technology, the book reiterates less is best. The book suggests how the lighting should be, how big the font should be, and how many slides to use and how the slides should not only relate to your subject, but how the slides should not interfere with your audience's attention. The use of remote control devices is preferred in order to give the presenter more range of movement on stage or into the audience.  The book concludes with the importance of \\"The Three C's\\"; this is how Contribution to the audience, Connection with the audience, and Change of the audience's thinking, feelings, and actions should be the presenter's goal. After reading \\"The Naked Presenter\\", I am inspired to incorporate as much of the above methods, ideas, and suggestions to my future presentations and forms of communication.   I really enjoyed reading this book, and this book gave me a new insight and approach to presentations. I've been use to standing behind the podium and reading material from the screen or paper, and I will definitely incorporate what I've read and learned to be a better presenter.
B0060BHUXI|1.0|Like most of the other reviewers, I love Il Divo. But this album is a disappointment. It seems as if the producers forget that its the \\" divine male singer\\" we are interested in. Sure, the instruments must be good, but I want to hear the singers, front and center. And I want to hear each voice clearly. Again, I think the producers forget that many Il divo fans favor one or the other member of the group, and want to follow that voice. Certainly Carlos Marin has a fabulous instrument, but so does Urs Buhler, and I strain to hear him over Marin's bellowing. The album has a muddy mix, and it bums me out. As to the song choices, I like a few very well, and a few not so much. That has been true of all of their albums, and I am pretty sure that each listener has a different like and dislike list, so I am not bothered by that. All in all, worth the money, because I enjoy their work, but probably will not listen to this much.

0670022950|3.0|Tn the first part of the book the author argues logically and convincingly, why -contrary to popular belief!- we are at present living in the least violent world there ever was.<br />In the second part of the book, he explains the \\"mental forces\\" ( of lack of a better term, I use this word), which drive violence and which inhibit violence.<br /><br />The aguments throughout are convincing, and times surprising and always well presented.<br /><br />BUT: The book is simply MUCH TOO LONG!! I have read other books by Prof. Pinker, and he always managed to get his point across in much fewer pages.

My favorite parts of the book are the interactions between the two.  Oberon loves Atticus and sausage.  Not always in that order.  Ha!    Atticus is funny, self depricating, and loves his pooch, Oberon.  I have recommended this book and the rest of the series to others and they loved it as much as I did.  The only thing I don't like about the books, is waiting so long for the new ones to come out.

B005HSG3VK|2.0|Marware use to have good products - you pay more to get more.  NOT on this. At $40 it should have been bullet proof and the flap to stand it up should have a slot or latch to lock it.  Flimsy and probably wont last a year - should be $10 but they only reduce it to $30.  Buy 2 of the $10 ones and come out ahead.

B005RYF5JA|5.0|Saw this concert on PBS with all the pledge interruptions. I would have had to pledge $100 I do not have to get it. This morning I went to Amazon and sure enough it is there for pre-order. You just know I did. It will be my post Christmas gift to me.   My 7 year old granddaughter will join me as she also loves their music!
0920668372|5.0|This is a great book about the love, intense love we have for our children. If you have a problem then the child parent senario may be off in your own family. This is a symbolic idea of the family circle and the love shared. Thats what most writings are about, the idea not the literal event. Relax and get the family love. Share it with a little one and it may make a difference forever. I have adult children down to 8yrs old. I am now a Grandma if this creeps you out then I am sorry for you. Its a STORY BOOK not real life, get over it. That is what kid books are! And this one is GOOD:)
B003L77GRO|5.0|I received my season of Dexter in less than a week. When you need to finish watching it you do not want to have to pay a huge fee or wait any longer than you have too to finish watching one of the greatest shows ever,
B005GP7F8Y|4.0|This has long been one of my favorite films!  I am happy to have it on blu-ray at last.  I do not know what these other reviewers were complaining about:  the picture quality and sound are excellent!  The only problem I had was getting the language to change from German to English.  But that done, I really enjoyed watching the film again.  The score by Friedhofer is one of his best!!  The only major thing wrong is that it is not in widescreen!  I recommend that you ignore the other reviews and buy this blu-ray!

B005H0IW6W|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this album! Michael Bublé is an epic singer. I usually don't like listening to any versions of Christmas music other than traditional, but I've been listening to Bublé for a long time so I trust him with the Christmas music that I listen to. He does a fantastic job! I, literally, could listen to him sing all day. Michael Bublé is already thrown in with the legendary singers Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, etc. He just belongs to our generation:)  Buy this album! Enjoy the jazzy, traditional, talented perfectness that is, Michael Bublé!:)
0385344325|3.0|Rough and ready, independent, righteous and, yes, often self-righteous, brave, intelligent, skilled -- a man capable of what few men are, a man who never fails to please ... until, unfortunately, now.  Jack Reacher is a myth built on ideals and values Americans, men and women, cherish, created by an Englishman, Jim Grant writing as Lee Child.  Truly, Jack Reacher is the American knight-errant, traveling the width and breath of the U.S., saving damsels and the oppressed left and right in his own special, economical, and laconic style.<br /><br />And, for the most part, he's not much different in the origin novel THE AFFAIR.  Except that he is in very important and subtle ways:  he is too cold blooded and he is too arrogant.  Too cold blooded exemplified by the gunning down of the runty, stupidly prideful militia rat; too arrogant in his long-winded explanations to the local Mississippi vermin as to why they don't stand a chance against him:  three of you, six of you against me; please, bring an army, you cretins.  Then, it takes forever to do something, even the smallest thing like walk from point A to point B.  Add to these problems that the plot taxes credulity and that Reacher makes love like a robot.<br /><br />Surely, Jack Reacher deserved a better, richer, deeper origin myth, because he is a wonderfully empowering guy myth.  Please, Lee, do better next time.  As for you, who are new to the Reacher series, try any of the earlier books to understand the man's popularity.  My personal favorite:  ECHO BURNING.<br /><br />Finally, what's this about Tom Cruise portraying Jack Reacher?  How do the filmmakers plan to resolve the fact that Jack is 6'5\\" and Tom is ... let's just say considerably south of that?  But, of course, film is always imaginatively smaller than the printed word.

0446585025|4.0|I love Ellen. I think she's hilarious, original, and unafraid to be herself. This memoir, her third, proves all of those things. I haven't read her other two memoirs, but I certainly plan on it.<br /><br />I'll admit, some of the chapters were a little silly and pointless, but in its entirety, this book was funny, lighthearted, and entertaining. I was literally laughing out loud by page two... where Ellen claims her pen name is Danielle Steel. Bahaha. I was cracking up. Meanwhile, my boyfriend, a non-reader (yes, the horror!) had no idea who Danielle Steel was! Aaaanyways... now that I think about it, I was actually laughing when I first picked it up and was reading the back of the book. For real, next time you're in the store and you see this book, just pick it up and read the back.<br /><br />I've seen some bad reviews of this book, criticizing said pointless chapters and such, but honestly? Just look at the title of the book... Seriously... I'm Kidding. This book isn't meant to be taken seriously, it's for fun, so lighten up, you Negative Nancy's!<br /><br />Moving on!<br /><br />I don't get to watch Ellen's show very often, but if I was retired, I would most likely watch it every day. My point is, even if you don't watch her show, this is an excellent book to read if you like Ellen at all, and or just want a funny, positive book to read. It delves a little bit into her personal life, but not much. One day, I'd like to read a more personal memoir by Ellen, but for now, I'm enjoying laughing my butt off at her humorous essays, anecdotes, and ramblings.

144234430X|5.0|Stephen King's epic time traveling adventure, 11/22/1963, is a character driven novel full of suspense, thrills and romance. King fans should love it, but this book could also bring in many more readers who weren't really a fan of King's horror novels. No horror here, just a little sci-fi, and a great story from a great storyteller.<br /><br />At over 800 pages, the plot is really quite simple. Jake Epping is living in 2011 when friend Al Templeton shows him something. Al has discovered a loop in time, a wormhole that allows him to travel back in time to 1958. Al has been going back it time for years and each time it takes him back to the exact time. Al came up with the idea of stopping John F. Kennedy's assassination, and convinced Jake that it was a worthwhile goal. So, the novel is about Jake going back in time to 1958, and living in the past for five years until the time comes to stop the assassination. Then, Jake plans to return to the present, where he will be five years older, but only two minutes will have passed in real time.<br /><br />Jake doesn't really begin trying to stop Lee Harvey Oswald until the middle of the novel. And that is what I enjoyed so much. You are taken on a journey where you meet many wonderful characters. Jake first tries to help a man from 2011 by preventing his dad from killing his siblings in 1958. Then he tries to save a young woman who is killed in a hunting accident. Then, he winds up south of Dallas in the town of Jodie, TX, where he becomes a school teacher, and meets the beautiful, but tall and clumsy Sadie.<br /><br />It is fascinating to witness Jake establish a life during the 1960s and all its romanticized glory. King takes away some of that luster by portraying the past as it really was, but still it is a fun journey to take. And then there is Lee Harvey Oswald. We get to know Lee and his family well just as Jake spends months witnessing Oswald's life, primarily to make sure he is acting alone.<br /><br />The last fifty pages are an exceptional ending to a great book. Loose ends are tied up, questions are explained, and I closed the back cover happy I read this novel. I must point out a few possible flaws in the novel. As a novel based on time travel, there really isn't that much. Jake spends the majority of time in one time period. This novel truly is more about stopping JFK's assassination than time travel and all its paradoxes. I must also point out that considering all the political ramifications surrounding Kennedy's assasination being prevented, King thankfully avoids preaching or offering up political commentary. This is just a fun story focused on an event that altered the course of history and forever changed the lives of those who lived throug it.at book.

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Arrived new and in box as advertised and within the time frame. It may have even come a little early. No scratches, plays just fine, everything you would expect when buying a DVD, so it's good.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|This review of GREEN LANTERN is for all those people, like me, who couldn't tell you the difference between Green Lantern or Green Hornet, who don't read comics, or who don't care about the origin of super heroes. GREEN LANTERN was a big summer release in 2011, and even though it featured an obscure superhero, my son and I checked it out. And...we really liked it.<br /><br />The origin of how Hal Jordan became the Green Lantern is easy to understand and interesting, even as Hal travels the universe in his green ball of energy. The scenes in outerspace don't quite seem real but also don't have much to do with the story. The acting is entertaining, led by the always humorous Ryan Reynolds, who excels in all but the few parts where he has to act macho. Blake Lively is attractive, although a bit unbelievable, as a fighter pilot/business woman.<br /><br />This is an easy to understand, funny, superhero movie. It's a little light on the action, and it may not have all the backstory or elements that fans of Green Lantern expect, but if you don't care about all that stuff, you should enjoy this rather short (1:45) film.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Wow! What a bargain....a wonderful CD and an even better full concert DVD. This concert really shows his strength as a classic jazz singer with full orchestra (set at the gorgeous Wiltern in LA). If you just know this guy for his pop hits, you are in for a fabulous treat! Can't rate this package high enough...10 stars! (BTW, had NO problems playing the DVD in my standard DVD player and I live in southern U.S.)

B000002H97|1.0|This album is for anyone who does not like angry thrash metal and more poppy type tunes such as \\"Enter Sandman\\".  Its Metallica with its fangs removed and turned into a radio friendly hard rock sound.  There are a few good songs such as My Friend of Misery, The God that Failed and maybe one or two other songs but really, if you want speed metal thrash you must go older, matter of fact everything they released after this album is garbage too.  I do not mind when bands change but really Metallica jumped about 20 sharks and they have become a joke in the metal scene.  Get Master or Justice... Forget this album was ever made.

1590171993|5.0|One of my great joys as a reader is to come across a \\"forgotten masterpiece\\" as the critics like to call them.  There is a great satisfaction reading an author you've never heard of and discovering a book that will remain  a part of you. Such is \\"Stoner\\" for me. The New York Review of Books reprint series is a treasure trove anyway,  but this quiet, passionate story of one man's life is a literary gem. Williams writes with an affectionate  sureness of the deep mysteries within any of us. Highly recommended to everyone.

B004EBZX6W|5.0|Great free app.  This one is a must for any Kindle Fire user.  Helps you know which wifi network signals are around, how strong/weak your signal is and what is the cleanest/less busy wifi channel available in your home area so you can get better connection and less interference from your crazy neighbors.  Note: You have to change the wifi channel in your wifi routers settings not on the app. You do this by accessing the settings UI with your web browser (usually 192.168.1.1 or something like that). Once you find the best channel (during peak hours in the evening, set your channel to the one least used and you will be happy)  Helps when out on the town as well trying to decide which public wifi signal to tap into.  Enjoy and be sure to tell others of this great app.
1594202842|1.0|Amy Chua is a horrible mother who yelled and screamed at her children whenever they even slightly disappointed her. I cringe when I imagine how cruel she would have been if one of her children had a learning disorder or a disability. Parents are supposed to love their children unconditionally. Amy Chua loves her children when they impress her, and she hates them otherwise. Her parenting style is abusive, and I'm surprised that Child Protective Services didn't remove her children from her home.

B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Let's see! I love hip hop and this will be the first review I write on any album.  Drake is by far the newest and freshest thing in Hip Hop right now.  He brings real hip hop back to the table.  I bought his first album and was impressed and i must say I was blown away by this album. The first track on this album is amazing!  I hope he can continue to make good music.  Very creative and different sound that just captures you.  If your into the traditional no lyrics and just beats then look some where else.  If you enjoy real lyrics with awesome sound then you need to buy this album.

B001FOPODS|5.0|This Peter follows closely to Prokofiev's music  - but, if you expect some narrator to carry you along, you'll find yourself all alone. The story emerges by itself, wordlessly, and does so in the most beautiful way. The Cat comes through with all the feline smugness you could hope for. The Hunter - well there's a whole new tension that I think Prokofiev never had in mind. If you grew up on the vapidized versions I did, this comes across with a harsh edge, resolved eventually in Peter's favor.<br /><br />But, for me, this is all about the animation. As much as I love CGI, it has yet to capture the extra level of human involvement and craft that inheres in puppet animation. This isn't the \\"happy ever after\\" story the disneyfied version wants you to expect. Instead, it has kids dealing with harsh realities - the way they do in the real world, like it or not.<br /><br />Good music, good animation, and it doesn't talk down to the viewer. Doesn't talk at all, really, but that's part of the appeal.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B004WR125O|2.0|I installed the Onkyo dongle into our new TX NR 709 receiver (receiver very nice so far).  After manually entering network access information, it connected with a signal strength of 45 percent and enabled us to log in and listen to multiple internet radio sources.  We did experience considerable break-ups due to buffering (typical internet download speeds to a wireless laptop range between 20 - 25 MB/s so the ISP isn't to blame).  Also had to do occasional resets to reacquire the router's signal.<br /><br />More recently, I used a powerline adapter to redeploy an aging Belkin Pre-N router as an access point within 15 feet of the receiver.  This boosted signal strength to 90 - 100%.  Break-ups due to buffering were greatly reduced.  Still had to do periodic resets to maintain connectivity.<br /><br />Early this week, the dongle totally died.  It could not find any WiFi access points.  After verifying that the receiver's USB port still worked (with my iPod) and discussing options with Onkyo, we determined that the dongle had died (common according to Onkyo).  It was also out of warranty.<br /><br />With the access point within 15 feet of the receiver, I opted to connect it to the internet via an Ethernet cable.  That solution worked immediately.

B0061S073A|4.0|very nice app. the only thing I would change is the transition screen. My two year old couldn't care less that he is being redirected because how isn't allowed to make that action. Maybe make the transition screen not display as long and have q funny picture or animal display or something. he gets a little frusterated with it. Otherwise great app!
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I purchased the colormunki display after my computer stopped recognizing my old spyder 2. The setup is quick and easy and this product is a big step up from my old syder. I like the fact that it measures the ambient light prior to calibrating your display and has a feature to check ambient light at preset intervals and adjust the display on the fly. You have a great amount of control over how your monitor is calibrated and I fell it does a much better job faster then my old equipment. I would definitely recommend this product to others looking to have a calibrated display without having to remortgage the house.

B000ZN802W|5.0|My friend and I have both read the book and thought the movie was very true to the book and brought the story alive. The cinematography was truly beautiful at times and horrifying at others. It captured the power and beauty but unforgiving nature of the Northern Wilderness.
B006ANJ4BW|4.0|I must say that I enjoyed the film for the most part. The look and feel of it was great. It had stupendous panorama shots of great locations, real and not real. I was very impressed. It was very graphic in its violence with blood often spurting out all over. Some parts with topless women dancing adds a certain bawdiness and realistic feel to the film.<br />The witch daughter played by Rose McGowan was very chilling. I thought she was outstanding. Stephan Lang as the villain was noteworthy as well. He was rather cliche, but pulled it off well. Computer generated special effects were first rate as well. On the downside was Conan, Jason Momoa, was good in looking the part and in the action scenes, but his acting was worse than Arnold's. Can't they find a muscle bound guy that can act too?  Rachel Nichols as Tamara, his love interest was okay. She just seemed mis-cast. She was too demure and then too vicious. She seemed like a good actress though. The most irritating part of the movie is its logic and poor story line. Overall it is typical in that an evil person wants to rule the world. It was just some scenes were just so foolish. If you can overlook that and enjoy some gory violence, naked women, and a little stupidity in the scenes it is a good movie. I would watch it again. It is just that it could have been a great movie.
B0060I0IG2|4.0|It is rare these days for the major labels to invest in projects of this magnitude, a Beethoven cycle from the most important conductor active today and one of the oldest orchestras in the world. Everything about this release had an air of importance about it and it nice to see that there can still be excitement (whether genuine or manufactured) for yet another Beethoven cycle. But the question at the end of day is whether the cycle is a success. And the answer to that is, of course, yes and no.  There is no question that Chailly is a brilliant musician and that his band is a spectacular ensemble. There are too many fine ensemble moments to catalogue individually, but the sparkling allegretto from the Eighth, the ferocious trio from the Fifth's scherzo, or the entirety of the Pastorale bespeak just how magnificent this ensemble really is. The strings rich and plush, the winds idiomatic, and the brass, horns especially, offering biting commentary on these tried and true war horses. Tutti passages never sound routine as Chailly unearths a kalidscope of colors from his players, such as in the andante from the first or the magnificent Konig Stephan overture.  What is most thrilling about this set, however, is that Chailly has a lot to say about this music, nearly all of it good. Chailly's intelligence is evident in the amalgam of styles on display here. Clearly, any cycle from the Gewandhaus must pay homage to its place in the history of the German tradition, and in that sense, Chailly's big string section and dramatic flair are in keeping with the interpretations from Karajan, Wand, and Blomstedt. At the same time, Chailly has as much of the spirit of Toscanni in him, coupled with the latest scholarship from the historically informed and period groups, with his brisk tempos and hard-hitting forward focus. This is most evident in his adagio from the fourth, a full two minutes faster than Bohm's \\"traditional\\" approach with the Vienna Philharmonic, and the finales from that same symphony, along with those of the second and eighth. What we are left with is big band Beethoven that is taught, athletic, angular, idiomatic, and, oddly individualistic.  Chailly opts for the Peter's editions of the symphonies, rather than the recent Barenreiter editions, which might raise a few eyebrows, but it effects mostly how the music is delivered rather than the notes proper. The result is smart - trumpets playing the entire main theme in the Eroica's coda, horns playing throughout the finale bars of the Leonore overture, the \\"traditional\\" dynamic markings for the timpani in the scherzo of the ninth. Throughout, Chailly owns his own brilliant interpretive touches. These include some tinkerings with dynamics - subito fortepianos in cadence figures - unearthing oft-buried textures - the horns in the scene by the brook (!) - and imbuing the music with the extremes that make Beethoven so satisfying. This being Chailly, however, means that not all the choices work. Like Harnoncourt before him, Chailly is sometimes too much of an interventionist for his own good. The ritardando at the developmental climax of the first's allegro is purposeless while the diminuendo he slathers over the main theme of eighth's allegro run counter to Beethoven's contentions. Nor is Chailly string-heavy tonal palette always advantageous; strings smother wind details in the fifth's finale while the antiphonally placed second violins are sometimes obscured in tutti passages.  As far as the individual performances go, there are some real standouts, including a stellar Pastorale - brisk and brilliant, coupled with some of the most informative and idiomatic playing you are likely to hear. The First has the air of Toscanni and Wand about it, which is saying something, while the fourth and eighth sparkle with energy. The Eroica's funeral march is a gruesome affair while the entirety of the ninth is a success. The second, fifth, and seventh are all excellent performance, even if, when compared to Szell or Vanska, they lack that last ounce of cosmic energy.  Yet, despite this long list of success, the cycle falls a hair short of perfection due to Chailly's hard-hitting approach. This is less a function of speed than it is tension; Chailly does not quite \\"let go\\" the way he should in the cantabile slow movement of the fourth, the dolce trio of the seventh, or in second's larghetto. In some ways, despite its obvious tonal and spiritual linkages to Toscanni and Karajan, there is a lot of Solti on display here. Big moments are spectacularly impressive, but some of the more tender moments feel muscle bound. Of course, Chailly is a far more sensitive and idiomatic conductor than Solti - I show my prejudice here - but his fiercely driven and explosively forceful Beethoven may not suit all tastes, most especially those that have yet to warm to fast Beethoven.   With that sole reservation, this set is well worth exploring. Chailly offers so much and his earnest, honest musicianship is infectious. His body, mind, and soul are entirely invested in this music, which is exactly what Beethoven requires. Recommended!

Clearly, any cycle from the Gewandhaus must pay homage to its place in the history of the German tradition, and in that sense, Chailly's big string section and dramatic flair are in keeping with the interpretations from Karajan, Wand, and Blomstedt. At the same time, Chailly has as much of the spirit of Toscanni in him, coupled with the latest scholarship from the historically informed and period groups, with his brisk tempos and hard-hitting forward focus. This is most evident in his adagio from the fourth, a full two minutes faster than Bohm's \\"traditional\\" approach with the Vienna Philharmonic, andthe finale from that same symphony, along with those of the second and eighth. What we are left with is big band Beethoven that is taught, athletic, angular, idiomatic, and, oddly individualistic.<br /><br />Chailly opts for the Peter's editions of the symphonies, rather than the recent Barenreiter editions, which might raise a few eyebrows, but it affects mostly how the music is delivered rather than the notes proper. The result is smart - trumpets playing the entire main theme in the Eroica's coda, horns playing throughout the final bars of the Leonore overture, the \\"traditional\\" dynamic markings for the timpani in the scherzo of the ninth. Throughout, Chailly adds his own brilliant interpretive touches. These include some tinkerings with dynamics - subito fortepianos in cadence figures - unearthing oft-buried textures - the horns in the scene by the brook (!) - and imbuing the music with the extremes that make Beethoven so satisfying. This being Chailly, however, means that not all the choices work. Like Harnoncourt before him, Chailly is sometimes too much of an interventionist for his own good. The ritardando at the developmental climax of the first's allegro is purposeless while the diminuendo he slathers over the main theme of eighth's allegro run counter to Beethoven's intentions. Nor is Chailly string-heavy tonal palette always advantageous; strings smother wind details in the fifth's finale while the antiphonally placed second violins are sometimes obscured in tutti passages.<br /><br />As far as the individual performances go, there are some real standouts, including a stellar Pastorale - brisk and brilliant, coupled with some of the most informative and idiomatic playing you are likely to hear. The First has the air of Toscanni and Wand about it, which is saying something, while the fourth and eighth sparkle with energy. The Eroica's funeral march is a gruesome affair while the entirety of the ninth is a success. The fifth and seventh are both excellentperformance, even if, when compared to Szell or Vanska, they lack that last ounce of cosmic energy.<br /><br />Yet, despite this long list of success, the cycle falls a hair short of perfection due to Chailly's hard-hitting approach. This is less a function of speed than it is tension; Chailly does not quite \\"let go\\" the way he should in the cantabile slow movement of the fourth, the dolce trio of the seventh, or in second's larghetto. In some ways, despite its obvious tonal and spiritual linkages to Toscanni and Karajan, there is a lot of Solti on display here. Big moments are spectacularly impressive, but some of the more tender moments feel muscle bound. Of course, Chailly is a far more sensitive and idiomatic conductor than Solti - I show my prejudice here - but his fiercely driven and explosively forceful Beethoven may not suit all tastes, most especially those that have yet to warm to fast Beethoven.<br /><br />With that sole reservation, this set is well worth exploring. Chailly offers so much and his earnest, honest musicianship is infectious. His body, mind, and soul are entirely invested in this music, which is exactly what Beethoven requires. Recommended!

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Woody Allen's love affair with Paris.<br /><br />A winner of a movie! Thanks for this one, Woody Allen, I hope you win an award and I hope this movie wins many. The first minute or two of this film, scenes of Paris with jazz music, was wonderful! (Frankly, I would have preferred classical cello music, but the visuals alone worked beautifully with their sepia overtones.)<br /><br />My favorite scene involved a surrealistic exchange among Dali, Luis Bunuel, Man Ray and our protagonist Gil where they all spoke about a rhinoceros from their individual viewpoints. (Inspired and hilarious -- loved it!) Other great philosophy came from Hemingway. And on writing, Gertrude Stein said it best.<br /><br />Brilliant cast: Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali, Tom Hiddleston as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Carla Bruni as museum guide. The part of Owen Wilson would most likely have been played by Woody Allen himself if he had been slightly younger, but Wilson does his best to affect Allen's mannerisms.<br /><br />Paris IS a most beautiful city. I've walked much of Paris in the rain and I agree with one premise of this movie: rain enhances the beauty of Paris. (One of my most invigorating days, ever, was sitting on the top level of an open-air tour bus, in the rain, umbrella open, soaring around Paris from one arrondissement to another.)<br /><br />This is a movie I will want to watch at least once a year as I do with Enchanted April, Amelie, Up At The Villa, It's A Wonderful Life and a few other classics where immeasurable love and skill went into their creation.

Layer one look like a regular gummy wrap plus some odd side bars that protect all the buttons, causing a slight confusion at first glance.

What is truly remarkable is that it's not from the 80s when heavy metal was big. Priest was bringing down the house even before British Steel and this album shows off their talent in a big way.  And make no mistake, while everyone is firing on all cylinders (as always in Priest concerts), this album is all about ROB HALFORD.  Only Halford has the voice that can pierce through pure metal.  With the classics 70s tunes like Sinner, Victim of Changes, Diamonds and Rust, and the recent release even has Delivering the Goods.  Listen to the performance of Sinner, at the end of the song Rob screaming SINNER!!! its amazing that venue did not collapse.
0321704452|5.0|\\"Standing up to recite information while others passively listen and perhaps take notes is the common and traditional presentation mode.  But it's an ineffective way to teach, inspire or motivate an audience.  If the lone goal is the transfer of information, you are better off distributing a handout and canceling the presentation.\\"  (Garr Reynolds, 2011)<br /><br />This paragraph was, in my opinion, one of the most powerful statements in the whole book.  It was also a reminder to me that the best presentations are the ones where the audience feels a connection to the presenter and they are receiving the information in a conversational style.  This is Garr Reynolds' opinion and I believe this as well.  The Naked Presenter was written by Garr to help individuals develop a presentation style that is pure, simple, direct, honest, and clear.  I really connected with this style and am excited to incorporate it into my future presentations.<br /><br />I found value in changing my delivery style from a performance mindset to more of a conversation format.  Presentations to me have always carried the weight of me, performing in front of a crowd. Garr's point is that we shouldn't focus on what we will present to the crowd but rather what the crowd needs to receive from the presentation.  When we do that we take the focus off of ourselves and put the focus on the audience.  That produces a much more beneficial outcome to the listener.<br /><br />We should focus on the beginning and the end of the presentation since that is what most audiences remember the most.  The opening should be so interesting that the audience is immediately interested in the topic.  Garr suggests using P.U.N.C.H (Personal, Unexpected, Novel, Challenging, Humorous) to do this.  I find that when speakers use a Personal approach or incorporate Humor into the presentation it is easier for a listener to relate and remain engaged in the subject.<br /><br />End with a powerful finish. This is something that I find valuable in preparing speeches but can at times forget this crucial part.  I thought that Garr's point about reinforcing the central theme after a Q&A session was spot on.  If you don't do that then the audience has a chance to walk out and miss the main point of the presentation.  This can be remedied by summarizing the main points, using a story or memorable quote to inspire the audience to further action.<br /><br />Overall a great read and I highly recommend this book for anyone who needs a fresh approach to presentations.s but can at times forget this crucial part.

B000002UUX|5.0|I can't imagine what the metal community's reaction must have been like when this album came out as I was 1 year old at the time, Dave had just fired 2 band members (again) and he was having major issues with drugs.  It looked for a bit like Megadeth's career was starting to fade.<br /><br />Anyone who thought Megadeth was going to fizzle out because of these issues was completely WRONG.  No question this album is a game changer and benefited from two MAJOR talent upgrades with Marty Friedman on guitar and Nick Menza on the drums.  I don't think this album would have been nearly as good with Jeff Young and Chuck Behler.<br /><br />Without going into a detailed review, top to bottom this is the most solid album from one of the greatest metal bands of all time.  Just listen to it!

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|While I have great respect for what Metallica has done in the past (KEA, RTL, and MOP are 3 of the greatest and most influental metal albums of all time), and I do like some Lou Reed stuff, this album is just....I can't even describe its so awful.  The first time listening to the album I seriously thought it was a joke, how can anything possibly be this bad.  For sure someone from the band, or the record company, would have pulled the plug on this before allowing it to be released.  Considering this is a collaboration of world famous artists you think they would put at least some sort of effort into making it good.    The music component is extremely uninspired (not to mention boring), the lyrics make no sense at all, the songs are very long and repetetive, and Lou Reed sounds like an old man in a gutter strung out on heroin.  I cannot give a comprehensive review, I do not remember any of the songs names, they all mash together and sound like one steaming pile of you know what.  It doesn't matter who is responsible for this, its still terrible and both parties involved should have done better.

B000002HNR|5.0|I first remember hearing this at a VERY laid-back get-together in 1971, in a tree house where we were all (four of us) on some really good acid. I have never forgotten the soul-feeding scream between \\"Alabama Song/Backdoor Man\\" or his lesson on \\"Petitioning the Non-Existent Lord with Prayer\\". In the meantime, it was pushed to the back of my mind until I saw it on here. I am so thrilled to revisit Jim's poetry and protests against the all-confining society against which we must \\"Break On Through\\"! This music will live forever, as long as people are oppressed by the hand that is supposed to feed and protect.

Was really hoping that Daughtry would come out swinging on this one after the last one barely had a real rock tune to it. We know he has the voice and we know the band can rock so why are they holding back? The deluxe should have been sold as a regular disc. I checked for months trying to get a sample of the songs but could'nt find a site that had them so I bought on a guess. Daughtry fans will like it.<br />But I was hoping they'd break the \\"American Idol\\" theme and move up on the rock charts.

B005974CNA|4.0|Enter the skeptics as founding drummer Mike Portnoy departs and is relaced by Mike Mangini. I have to say this was a very good CD, but nothing earth-shattering. Mangini's drumming is a little underutilized, but he does get to show his amazing speed and skills here and there.  The main thing I miss from Portnoy is that he frequently found ways to drive the band and the music forward, especially in my favorite D.T. CD, [[ASIN:B001AXKXEY Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence]].  Perhaps as Mangini and the rest of the band get to know each other and their capabilities, we may see some innovation from Mangini.  So I wouldn't call this a starter CD to hear what D.T. is like, but it's certainly good music. As a fan of D.T., and a fan of Portnoy, I would say to fellow fans that this D.T. is worth sticking with, and to get this CD.
0143038419|4.0|It took me a while to get into this book, but once I did I really enjoyed it. The beginning detailing the breakdown of Elizabeth Gilbert's marriage is kind of dull but necessary to the story, I suppose. Her time in Italy is kind of so-so, but once she gets to India the book gets really good. The whole idea of spending a year eating in Italy, praying in India, and loving in Indonesia is like a dream come true for most women. I find it inspiring that Gilbert actually did this, and I enjoyed living vicariously through her.

0375842209|5.0|I've read many Holocaust books, but this one takes a different, very personal perspective and feels unique. It's an incredibly fast read and an extremely touching plot. The main character is a non-Jewish child trying to make sense of all the horrors she witnesses. There is a sense of impending doom throughout the whole book. You care deeply about Leisel's father and mother, and Max the boxer. It's hard to tell where disaster will come from or to know if you should keep hope alive as you read. When you finish it, you truly feel like you were transported into another life for a little while.

1416550550|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I've read all three of Kate Morton's books, and this is the only one I can honestly say I genuinely liked. It was the first one I read, so I've since read the other two ([[ASIN:1416550534 The House at Riverton: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:1439152799 The Distant Hours: A Novel]]) and have been a bit disappointed. However, this one is obviously very influenced by The Secret Garden (one of my all-time favorite stories) and English Gothic literature. I also read an article that said Kate Morton drew upon her personal experiences as an Australian whose grandmother was an adopted orphan and imagining what her ancestry might have been. I think that personal touch really shines through in this book, which is probably why the characters feel better developed and more emotionally connected to the reader than in other books by Kate Morton.
0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha is a poignant tale reflecting on the eternal conflict between mind, body, and spirit. Hesse's visual and narrative language is so simple and yet so vivid and uplifting. This is a book that speaks to each one of us and at the end lets each come to his or her own conclusion. Quite simply one of the greatest novels ever written.
1416550534|3.0|I keep buying Kate Morton's books and I keep finding them difficult to read and not as satisfying as they promise to be. Actually, I really enjoyed The Forgotten Garden, but I wasn't a huge fan of The House at Riverton or The Distant Hours. I don't know what it is about the writing style or the characters, but these books don't pace well or keep me turning the pages. They all have classic, Gothic English themes that I should love. However, I think they under-deliver a bit. I don't really care about the main characters (fairly one-dimensional), and the plot moves very slowly without any historical detail or interesting plot developments.
1400052181|5.0|This book was simply amazing. Very well written and detailed. Rebecca really put you there. You can feel the work and energy that she put into writing this book. She also did a great job of displaying the strength and courage of Henrietta and her family. It is a work of art. Her persistance paid off. This will certainly be my little known Black History fact in the month of February, 2012 that I will share with in my son's classroom.

We have rape depicted as romantic foreplay and a final shot of Cooper atop a skyscraper that needed to be shown forward and reverse because there wasn't enough footage for the final scene, so we have that weird repeated back and forth movement of his hair in the wind.

1575666286|5.0|My comment addresses the therapy in general as there seems to be a fair amount of long commentary written by critics with no actual experience using this therapy. All I can say to them is 'the proof is in the pudding'. I, too, have read many books \\"cover to cover\\" yet until you actually \\"do\\" something it's pretty hard to comment meaningfully on its value. I have done the therapy, not for cancer, but for Lyme disease. I started in Jan. 2011 and now, almost a year later, find myself in a significantly improved state of health, and free of pharmaceuticals for the first time in 7 years.   I followed the therapy to the letter for six months then tapered off on the number of both juices and coffee enemas, while adding other ORGANIC foods (including meat) into my diet. (If I had a cancer diagnosis, I would have continued with the full therapy for the required 1.5 to 2 years necessary to regenerate a new liver.) My goal was to detoxify my body and strengthen it nutritionally so that  my immune system could function more optimally. That is what the therapy is designed to do. PERIOD. The foods used on the therapy were not chosen willy-nilly, Dr. Gerson developed and fine-tuned the diet over his more than 30 years of treating chronically ill patients, many with late stage cancer. He learned what worked and what didn't. I recommend Dr. Gerson's own book: A Cancer Therapy, Results of Fifty Cases & Cure of Advanced Cancer by Diet Therapy to anyone interested in learning how the therapy was developed or why certain foods or supplements are used or need to be avoided. Of all the books I have read related to the Gerson Therapy, I found it to be the most interesting and informative.  In his book, Dr. Gerson stated that conventional agricultural methods produce foods that not only contain the residues of pesticides, but which also are lacking in nutritional value since the soils were (and still are) not being replenished.  Our bodies are overloaded with toxins from food as well as theenvironment in general, and we are nutritionally depleted. Can anyone seriously argue against that? Yes, it costs more to buy organic produce and meat, but how much is a doctor's visit? drugs? conventional cancer therapy? heart bypass surgery? Dr. Gerson predicted in his 1950s book that the babies of that time would likely not outlive their parents because the babies started life on processed, poisoned foods.  Look at the obituaries--how many people do you see that are 60 years old or younger?  When someone speaks out against this therapy, consider their motives. There is a lot of money being made off the chronically ill, and many people with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. Get well in spite of them.  Note: I used a SuperAngel juicer ($990) for the treatment, not the recommended Norwalk ($2500).
0307454541|5.0|Stieg Larsson carefully weaves his tale of intrigue, corruption, and interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />The book was a bit slow to start, as Larsson methodically started laying the groundwork for the story.  However, around page 150 I found myself completely hooked and from that moment on, I found it difficult to put the book down.<br /><br />I applaud the author's wiliness to delve into the dark reality of violence against women.  The book also has strong themes related to the examination of morality and at times makes you take a closer examination of what constitutes right and wrong.<br /><br />The characters were complex and compelling, often with relationships that are effective, yet beyond the bounds of tradition.<br /><br />I also really appreciated that while this is a 3-book series, the story was complete.  The denouement was a bit drawn out, but necessarily so, due to the complexity of the story.<br /><br />I cannot wait to read \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" and \\"The Girl Who Kicked a Hornet's Nest\\".
B0007KTBIU|3.0|Wow and wow. Disney certainly doesn't restrain itself on this one. This movie plays out more like a Disney parody than an actual film. John Smith is a tall Prince Charming type with flowing blond hair, a commanding voice and the bravery of ten men but nothing beats the introduction of Pocahontas. The camera pans up to her standing in a dramatic pose on a rocky outcrop overlooking the land while the wind whips colorful leaves around her. Since she's Native American she can literally talk to the animals including her raccoon friend, Meeko. A girl in a canoe calls to her and I'm thinking, \\"she's definitely going to dive the football field length down into the lake\\". To my surprise she turns to run down the mountain... before doubling back and doing a flawless dive into the lake. OF COURSE John Smith and Pocahontas will end up together; they are both perfect. It's not enough for Pocahontas to commune with the animals, she literally talks to the trees and they talk back... with faces. Oh, is that not enough for you? She also gets messages from the wind. Still not convinced Pocahontas is perfection? She is able to learn English instantly, no explanation given. She even understands terms she couldn't possibly have any frame of reference for understanding. Rocks and bushes glow at her touch, raccoons braid her hair and she's able to ride on the wind.<br /><br />Pocahontas is hundreds of years of white guilt drawn up into one flawless Native American princess. It's is an 81 minute exaltation to the Disney Pocahontas; the Reductio Ad Absurdum of \\"Disney Magic\\". The actual Pocahontas died in her early 20's married to a tobacco planter named John Rolfe. There is a wisp of a story, a villain and some obnoxious animal sidekicks but they exist merely to complete the Disney formula and pad out the story. This is a story about how freaking AWESOME Native American's are and how only John Smith was worthy of being in their presence. Smith even manages to see the talking tree. There is a song near the end of the movie where the Native American's are shown to be as bigoted as the whites but I doubt the audience is fooled. The Native American's clearly have the moral superiority in this film.<br /><br />So I hated the movie, correct? Actually no. Pocahontas is such a parody in and of itself that you can just bask in its unapologetic unrestrained self indulgence. Like Superman or Mickey Mouse, Pocahontas the character has no depth and no personal conflict but there can be a certain joy and simplicity in such unimpeachable goodness. She isn't a human she's an archetype of female strength and kindness. When her friend Nakoma confesses that she sent Kocoum to save her leading to his death Pocahontas never ever for a fraction of a second blames Nakoma. She is simply beyond human flaws. If you want to be awash in everything that people love and hate about Disney this is the movie to see.<br /><br />Financially Pocahontas was a huge success and it has two really good songs but critically it was pretty middle of the road. I really didn't have a problem with any of the voice acting and somehow through the whole film I never picked up on the fact that Smith was voiced by Mel Gibson. Smith's friend Thomas was voiced by a young Christian Bale. To Disney's credit they showed a shocking burst of historical accuracy by having Pocahontas NOT end up with John Smith and in the sequel she correctly ends up with John Rolfe. Pocahontas is sort of a turning point where Disney reached its extreme before pulling back. After this movie Disney started slowly but surely changing the formula culminating in some wonderful films like The Emperor's New Groove and Lilo & Stich. These films were more highly acclaimed but less successful financially. So what is the lesson here? No idea other than Disney sadly learned from the latter two films to avoid experimentation.a song near the end of the movie where the Native American's are shown to be as bigoted as the whites but I doubt the audience is fooled. The Native American's clearly have the moral superiority in this film.<br /><br />So I hated the movie, correct? Actually no. Pocahontas is such a parody in and of itself that you can just bask in its unapologetic unrestrained self indulgence. Like Superman or Mickey Mouse, Pocahontas the character has no depth and no personal conflict but there can be a certain joy and simplicity in such unimpeachable goodness.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63  I couldn't put it down,Steven King thank you very much for a very heart warming story.  I highly recommend this book to everyone...this is my first review of any of the books Iv.e read on my kindle.  this book was my 153rd
0756686970|5.0|This is a great book.  I'm still amazed of the staying power of Star Wars based on how long ago it came out and how our kids are still dressing as Star Wars characters this past Halloween.  Lego does a great job to present their version of Star Wars for kids. My 5 year old boy loves this book and although he can't fully read yet, the pictures of each of the many characters keeps him very interested (better than some toys).  The book is very informative also for adults and references the Lego Product Number kits where you can order / buy each character or set.  It'll be one of those books that you keep for a while on you or your kid's bookshelf since it'll always be a great reference to look to.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|I'm a fan of concert DVDs since I want that feeling that I'm actually at the concert.  However recently there hasn't been good concert DVDs, since most of them are either poorly shot or the audio is not that great.  I remember the last, best one I saw was Diana Kralls' Live in Paris Concert DVD which was awesome.  Finally the greatness of the concert DVD is back with this Adele one.  I am a fairly new Adele fan and have converted my wife and kids to new fans too, so this concert DVD is a great introduction and summary of who is Adele and her songs.  Besides her great songs & amazing voice (great soulfulness), I like the way she talked about the background of each song during the concert and her upfrontness which is refreshing as well as entertaining.  This is a concert DVD worth getting.  By the way she does curse a lot when she talks about her songs during the concert, so not appropriate for young kids.
0307593312|5.0|I agree with a lot that previous reviewers have said, e.g., about Murakami and women -- the hardest part to take was his view of the perfect, magical woman, and it does read a bit like a shallow Penthouse-y approach, but, then, his generation is the one that porn mags like that were invented for/because of. Even so, it's overdone by now. For me, a woman reading him, it's also annoying and disturbs the fictional dream. Tho I have no objection to explicit sex scenes when well-written, I seldom read books by men of his generation, for exactly this reason. So, that's one strike and it's a serious one, cost him half a star, but only half because the rest of the book rocks. Other problems, I can cut him slack for. Yes, the plot does move along with certain characters suddenly knowing things that real people would have been hard pressed to figure out, but, it's that kind of novel. It's based on a fantasy world that is ever so slightly different from the real one. The plot line is the writing of a fantasy novel by a young girl, the people who willingly and unwillingly, knowingly and unknowingly, get wrapped up in it. There are great characters, but they are great in a fun way -- Tamaru, the security man, dangerous but sensitive. Aomame, escaped as a child from a religious family. Tengo, trying hard to believe he is not really his father's son. Komatsu the editor, talented, bitter and bearing grudges is probably the most realistic of all.   I'm a Murakami fan, and I fell whole into this book, absorbed into another world. It's not the one I'd recommend starting with. Start with the stories, imo. His novels are brilliant but tend to be a bit long-winded, and he especially does not pick up the pace even as the story builds to its climax. There were a few chapters, that while interesting, were entirely unnecessary and one only served to introduce a question that was not answered. Unless he's writing a sequel. I don't know if I could survive a sequel. I might never get out of thealternative universe myself if I kept reading 900-page novels like this. It wouldn't be the worst way to go, tho.
B00000IMTF|5.0|128 reviews, 5 star average- need I say more?  Dio was actually quite apathetic towards this album, but I suspect that is only because deep down he knew he never bettered it, once he was out on his own.  An absolute classic of fantasy-laden, Zeppelinesque heavy rock.  In fact its the equal of any hard rock album ever made.  The songs, the amazing musuicianship (esp Blackmore's guitar playing), Dio's titanic vocals- combined with stunning musical and lyrical creativity, make this a must own for any serious rock fan.  What a shame there isn't more!
B005TBWN0K|4.0|Skitchpad is great if you are looking for a &quot;cute&quot; sketchpad with some and, yes, there are only a few features that set it apart from the rest. Skitchpad is especially great when partnered with Evernote. You can draw with different sizes and a couple different colors. Also, you can add typed text, circles, triangles, rectangles, and hearts. Seeing that I reviewed this for the Kindle Fire, you could only send it via e-mail, and Evernote with NO support to facebook.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|I'll give this movie 5 stars for special effects, but who cares.  Talk about overkill. This is for the video game crowd who can stand to play for hours on end.  If you want a similar thrill as this movie gives but not take 2 1/2 hours to do it you could try to down a fifth of tequila real fast or jump off of a tall building and land on your head.<br /><br />The effects are spectacular, the acting is very good, production values all top quality, and the soundtrack music reminds you when you should feel sad, excited, tense, or whatever.  The problem is I didn't feel much of anything except really bored.<br /><br />My favorite part of the movie was the ending--or should I say, when it ended. Oh man, I couldn't wait for this film to end.  But compulsive as I am to watch a film all the way through, I stayed to the end.  What a waste.<br /><br />Yeah, this is the kind of film the makes you want to stand up and cheer.  When it was over I jumped up and cheered, \\"Yay! It's over at last!\\"<br /><br />The things lacking in this movie are good story and heart.  It's the same old song that we've heard before and it's not one you want to sing along with.  Maybe if they'd saved a hundred million or so and made the film about an hour and a half shorter and then distributed the wealth of what they'd saved to people who needed it, the world would have been a better place and the film makers and investors would have still made a ton of money off of it.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film yet and decide to do so, you can't say I didn't warn you.  Sometimes people think they just have to suffer the torture to see what it's like for themselves.  Ouch--my head hurts.
1419702238|5.0|I typically like to preview books before I buy them for my child and this book was no exception.  My son came home from school talking about this author Jeff Kinney and how he heard he was really good and going to write this book called Diary of a Wimpy kid.<br /><br />I found the book on Amazon and took a look at the reviews and the previews and decided to order it.  I am so glad I did.<br /><br />Secretly, I read it before I gave it to my son at night after he went to bed, and I have been doing that with each book since, because I love them so much!<br />Jeff Kinney is right up there I think with Judy Blume, Beverly Cleary, and Betty McDonald!<br /><br />Two thumbs up for me!
B0067QPVD2|1.0|I read over a year ago that this prequel was being made to one of my favourite films of all time, i was very exited and couldn't wait to see it especially after i read that they were going back to doing old skool make up effects to try and look like the original film. God was i disappionted when finally got to see it on opening night. It was the biggest piece of crap i have ever seen. There was no tension or atmosphere, the actors you didn't care if they died or not and the worst thing was the creature effects were nearly all CGI and most of the creatures looked very similar, not one good really creative creature in the whole film infact some of them just looked ridiculous especially the arm and hands running around. A serious missed oportunity and to be honest i can't see why these other reviewers liked the film all i can think is that they are all younger people who have grown up with crappy CGI effects and no idea's, as far as i can see anyone who is a true fan of the original film will absolutly hate this piece of crap.

0316056863|5.0|This book is so funny!  There were times when I was literally laughing out loud.  Tina Fay is articulate and makes it easy to relate to her.  It's also interesting getting a little behind the scenes picture of SNL, Second City, and 30 Rock.  Additionally, I think she gives some pretty sound advice on leadership and on being a successful female in the workplace.  After reading the book, I bought the audio version so my husband could hear it on our long trip for Thanksgiving weekend, and he really got a kick out of it too.  I highly recommend this book!
0446547654|4.0|This book has lived up to what I've come to expect from Nicholas Sparks.  It catches you and draws you quickly into the lives of all of the characters.  Through the the stories of Dawson, Amanda, and Tuck, Sparks draws us back a bit to feelings most of us have experienced through our lives while getting to where we are now... mixed feelings of wonder, love, pain, regrets, and finding the happiness in where we're at now and the possibilities of the future.  Towards the end of the book, I did think it was a little predictable.  But other than that I've read hundreds of books, and there's only so many ways to end a story, the predictability comes from what Nicholas Sparks has made of the characters.  When you know the types of people, you can predict how things most likely will play out.  And if Sparks were to write a \\"surprise ending\\" it wouldn't really be keeping with the characters he's shared with us throughout the entire book.    This is a book I would recommend reading to friends, family, and strangers alike... and already have.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!

0061251321|5.0|To begin the authors define a tribe as \\"a group between 20 and 150 people. Here's the test for whether someone is in one of your tribes: if you saw her walking down the street, you'd stop and say \\"hello\\"\\". The continue: \\"Tribes in company get work done - sometimes a lot of work - but they don't form because of work. Tribes are the basic building block of any large human effort, including earning a living. As such their influence is greater than that of teams, entire companies, and even superstar CEOs. In companies, tribes decide whether the new leader is going to flourish or get taken out. They determine how much work gets done, and of what quality.\\" The key question is then what makes the difference between tribes that excel and others that do not? The authors argue it is the presence of Tribal Leaders. The continue by defining what tribal leaders do: \\"Tribal Leaders focus their efforts on building the tribe - or more precisely, upgrading the tribal culture...Divisions and companies run by Tribal Leaders set the standard of performance in their industries, from productivity and profitability to employee retention. They are talent magnets, with people so eager to work for the leader that they will take a pay cut if necessary...Their efforts seem effortless, leaving may people puzzled by how they do it.  Many Tribal Leaders, if asked can't articulate what they are doing that's different, but after reading this book, you will be able to explain and duplicate their success.\\"<br /><br />The book's main focus after having defined the tribe and Tribal Leadership is to \\"give you perspective and tools of a Tribal Leader: someone who can unstick the conveyor belt - and make it run faster  for whole groups of people, no matter which stage they're in. The result is more effective workplaces, greater strategic success, less stress, and more fun.\\" This conveyor belt is an analogy for what the authors define as the tribal stages 1 through 5. Each stage is characterized by certain language and behavior.<br /><br />Stage 1: \\"The person at Stage One is alienated from others, expressing the view that \\"life sucks.\\"<br /><br />Stage 2: \\"Stage Two people are surrounded by people who seem to have some power they lack. As a results, their language expresses \\"my life sucks.\\"<br /><br />Stage 3: \\"The person at Stage Three is connected to others in a series of dyadic (two-person) relationships. the language of this stage expresses \\"I'm great,\\" and in the background - unstated - is \\"and you're not.\\"<br /><br />Stage 4: \\"The person forms structures called triads, in which they build values-based relationships between others. At the same time, the words of Stage Four people are centered on \\"we're great\\" and, in the background, \\"and they're not.\\" The \\"they\\" is another tribe - in the same company or in another.<br /><br />Stage 5: \\"A person at Stage Five expresses \\"life is great.\\" Five shares the same characteristics of Four, except that there is no \\"they.\\" As a result, these people form ever-growing networks with anyone whose values resonate with their own. The only Stage Five cultures we have observed (in corporate settings) exists as long as a history-making project lasts or as long as the tribe is so far ahead of its competitors that they are irrelevant.\\"<br /><br />Simply put the role of Tribal Leaders is \\"do two things: (1) listen for which cultures exist in their tribes and (2) upgrade those tribes using specific leverage points.\\"<br /><br />A very interesting, educative and fun read. It helps one look at companies through a new viewpoint with a specific focus on the culture and relationships/dynamics within it. It is filled with practical real-life examples and applications and backed by substantial empirical research. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Below are excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- \\"People at Stage Three approach leadership as though it were a set of tasks they could check off their to-do list (e.g., \\"set the vision,\\" \\"get alignment,\\" and \\"listen with intention\\"). The moment leadership becomes cookie-cutter, it isn't leadership at all - it's management. By making the person aware that he's behaving in a Stage Three fashion toward leadership, you might help him see that he isn't a leader at all. This realization may propel him into the set of epiphanies of the next chapter.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"...The two most important aspects of owning Stage Four: identifying and leveraging core values, and aligning on a noble cause. Everything else the tribe does should be sandwiched between these constructs. Projects, activities, initiatives, processes - unless they are fueled by values and reach toward the tribal vision - should either be rethought until they are consistent with these guiding principles, or pruned. By definition, core values and a noble cause can never be \\"checked off,\\" in the same way that companies complete an upgrade to computer technology.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"...Values must be core, and that means universal...Second, the unity resulting from core cause and a noble cause must be alignment, not agreement...Alignment, to us, means bringing pieces into the same line - the same direction.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"The Tribal Leadership Strategy Map: Start with core values and noble cause in the center, then move to outcomes and go counterclockwise around the model (assets and behaviors). Test Questions: Assets sufficient for the Outcomes? Enough assets for behaviors? Will behaviors accomplish outcomes?\\"<br /><br />5- \\"An outcome, by contrast (to a goal), is  a present state of success that morphs into an even bigger victory over time.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"A stage five tribe can work with any group that has a commitment to values that are core and that apply to everyone, even if those values are different from its own.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"While Tribal Leaders do their work for the good of the group, not for themselves, they are rewarded with loyalty, hard work, innovation, and collaboration. The tribe gets work of higher quality done in less time. The person is often seen as a candidate for op organizational jobs or for positions in government.\\"okie-cutter, it isn't leadership at all - it's management.

B001F12J48|2.0|We purchased this video to watch on our Sony Bravia 3D tv. It comes with a \\"3D\\" DVD and the regular DVD. It also comes with 3 \\"3D\\" glasses. If you try to watch this video using your personal 3D glasses this picture is distorted and there is a large red shadow around everything. If you use the glasses that came with the movie, it takes away the red effect, but it is not 3D and you can only see out of one side of the glasses. Horrible! We took it out and watched the regular version. The video itself without the 3D is amazing. A fantastic Christmas movie.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|Best thing since th next gen gaming systems. Its big enough for the game system 2 controllers and your and extra cords. I got mine and i was worried it wont fit old model ps3. It did. Plus it comes with a protective cover inside so i jus place that between the ps3 and the screen from causing damage. The screen is big enough for 2 people to play at the same time and clear enough to. Its in HD and shows up great for 1080p games. Everything fits perfect for me inside the case even with the original ps3 (fat version). And i suggest everyone to get this item who is on the go. It folds up like a suit case for the go. The only thing to worry about is a power inverter for your car. It also comes with its own hdmi cord and has 2 outlets for headphones. A perfect gift

B005VJ8ATS|5.0|I wanted to see this movie in the theatre, but it was only playing at one art house in the city and I missed it.  Anyway, I finally got to see this beautiful movie tonight.  The movie has little dialog but conveys so much feeling.  This movie is a drama as someone else said here.  It is not a science fiction film, though it does delve a little into parallel universe theory - and the idea of, what decisions in life has the other \\"me\\" made?  Is the other me happy, or has the other me made terrible mistakes?    I loved the actress who played Rhoda.  She is one of those wonderful, natural actors.  The movie was so well acted, I felt like I was watching real people in this real situation.    This movie made me think about how all of our lives can be changed forever with a poor decision or act - and it can happen to any one of us.  I felt great compassion for both of the major characters in this movie.  I found this movie haunting and mesmerizing.  The lead actress, Brit Marling is amazing.  Without her subtle, understated performance, the movie wouldn't have been nearly as moving.  I loved this movie.

B003V6L94Q|5.0|This Zac Brown guy and his band have conquered me. What a sound! And everything else is there, too. Irony, humor, fine writing and storytelling--they've got it all, even the mastery of a variety of musical styles. I wrote a short story listening to the album. Just couldn't help myself. \\"Sweet Carolina\\" brings me to tears (it's not the only number that does that). And I get the biggest kick out of singing \\"Chicken Fried\\" wide open out loud. There's no song like it. It's not on this CD, but it's all the reason you need to buy another of the group's offerings. Long may they live, in the sweet sunny South I love so much.
1451627289|3.0|While it was fun to revisit some of King's past characters, especially those from [[ASIN:0451169514 It]] and the town of Derry, they seemed more like self-congratulatory name-dropping than anything else. Also, there just wasn't enough grittiness in this novel; it all felt like polished wit that was just taking up page space until the end could be sorted out. I still liked it better than I've liked most of his stuff over the past 20 years (hence the 3 stars), but it got too predictable towards the end. Part of that could be because we all know Kennedy was actually assassinated but I'm speaking more about character development and character interaction. There was really only one plausible way for the love interest to unfold and that was indeed the way it unfolded. A writer of King's caliber should be able to surprise me but that hasn't happened in awhile. He still holds my interest--I finished the book in three days--but I'm glad I didn't buy this book in First Edition hardcover (even though I would've SAVED money by doing so!), as I have with every other novel he's ever written. King is definitely more comfortable with short stories and I still look forward to his collections and magazine pieces. His novels haven't really changed since [[ASIN:0451167317 The Dark Half]] or [[ASIN:0451156609 The Tommyknockers]]. If you're a King fan, this book will keep you turning the pages. If you're not, I suggest you read [[ASIN:0307743683 The Stand]] and [[ASIN:0451210859 The Drawing of the Three (The Dark Tower, Book 2)]] before you read anything else (and, really, you could just stop there).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was pretty harsh on the second book in this series, calling Collins weak for not truly pushing the bounds of the human psyche.  I thought the situations Katniss were put it in worked out too conveniently for her and that the author just wimped out.  However, she was obviously just tricking us, because this third book blew all of those thoughts out of the water.<br /><br />This book offers more than just an intense, brutal look at war.  It's more than just a political statement.  It really is a look into how people would actually act in these terrible situations and the trials and moral dilemmas they go through.  I think some people have been overly critical of this book for not having a \\"happy enough ending\\" or being \\"too much for a YA.\\"  Well, I didn't know that all YA novels had to end in cheesy-Harry Potter like fashion (I do love Harry Potter, but come on) just because young adults are reading them.  Hey, welcome to the real world.  Not everyone ends up happily ever after and not everything is put in black and white for you.<br /><br />The author finally did what I hope she'd do.  She let the characters finally unravel and break down from these extreme circumstances, and their true colors came out.  Then it was just up to the reader to judge how they feel about these characters they've come to know.  This is a spoiler, but I don't know why some people are so bent out of shape for Collins supposedly making Gale suddenly the \\"bad guy\\" so that it would be simple for Katniss to choose.  I never really felt like Gale cared for Katniss in the same fashion that Peeta did.  Not to mention, Gale becomes more cold, distant and callous (maybe his true colors) throughout the book, caring less and less about hurting innocent people, and caring more about defending a cause that was questionable in its own right.  That's the person he was and ultimately succumbed to.  And honestly, Gale always seemed a bit emotionally manipulative and I never quite trusted him from the beginning.  Peeta, on the other hand, always had a soft heart, and never supported unnecessary violence - not even close.  Even when he was hijacked, he was still finally to come back to his own (well, somewhat).  Him and Katniss were meant to be together, in my opinion.  This is the beauty of this book though - there are many ways to interpret these characters and their actions.  But I definitely don't think Collin's choice of what to do with the \\"love triangle\\" was a result of poor or lazy writing.<br /><br />If you're looking for some sugar-coated, unrealistic, boring YA than this is NOT for you.  This is gritty, brutal, real, and Collins holds nothing back.  Love it - highly recommend the entire series, just so that you can read this masterpiece at the end.other hand, always had a soft heart, and never supported unnecessary violence - not even close.  Even when he was hijacked, he was still finally to come back to his own (well, somewhat).  Him and Katniss were meant to be together, in my opinion.  This is the beauty of this book though - there are many ways to interpret these characters and their actions.  But I definitely don't think Collin's choice of what to do with the \\"love triangle\\" was a result of poor or lazy writing.    If you're looking for some sugar-coated, unrealistic, boring YA than this is NOT for you.  This is gritty, brutal, real, and Collins holds nothing back.  Love it - highly recommend the entire series, just so that you can read this masterpiece at the end.

140131046X|3.0|I listened to this as an audio book, so my experience of the book may differ from those who read the physical book. Albom read the book and did a very good job with the reading. He was easy to understand and his voice was entertaining, especially when he sang like The Reb.<br /><br />I thought this book was just okay. I read Tuesdays With Morrie a few years ago and while I can't directly compare my experiences, I remember finishing that book with more of a sense of enjoyment than I did with this book.<br /><br />This story is about Albom's rabbi from his youth. The Reb, as the rabbi is lovingly referred to, asked Albom to write his eulogy. Albom has not practiced his Jewish faith in years and really only knew The Reb as a religious leader growing up, so he decides to interview The Reb to get to know him better as a person. The Reb sounds like a spirited old man who loves life, keeps calm in stressful situations, and loves to sing any and everything he can.<br /><br />This story is also about a Christian pastor in Albom's hometown of Detroit. This pastor has a bad past of drugs, stealing, and a few years in jail. However, he made a promise with God and stopped doing his bad activities, and came to be in charge of an old, crumbling, hole-in-the-roof church in downtown Detroit where he houses some homeless people and preaches on Sundays.<br /><br />While stories of the two men of God do not intersect in the story, they are both connected to Albom. Albom interacts with both of them and learns more about himself and their beliefs in God.<br /><br />I don't know what exactly I didn't like about the book. I think I wanted more out of it. I wanted it to be longer and more in depth and for the stories of the two men to come together more. It was just a mediocre book.
B005ORVMT2|3.0|First off, great set, as expected.  BUT the Fly By Night CD is definitely defective, with skitter on multiple tracks, AND my CD of All The World's A Stage is defective as Tracks 8 \\"In The End\\" 9 \\"Working Man / Finding My Way\\" and 10 \\"What You're Doing\\" freeze up on multiple players and will not rip to mp3 with various programs.  I even tried creating a disc image off the disc with no luck, as it froze up. Unless these issues are addressed, hold off on purchasing. Also, if anyone has this issue with All The World's A Stage, please post, as I haven't seen this problem online yet.

0312576463|2.0|I enjoyed \\"The Corrections\\"  and \\"Freedom\\" is more of the same but not as good.  Halfway I began to tire of his characters, especially Walter, who is this poorly crafted tree hugger.  If I'm going to read a 650 page novel I need to feel some interest and/or affection for the people involved. After 350 pages  I didn't give a damm what happened  to any of them.  Frazen  is an excellent writer but he need to learn to shut up when he has nothing to say.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is an incredible story of a family's ups and downs from the viewpoint of a dog. Funny, inspirational, and uplifting, this is a story you will never forget!
0670022411|1.0|I read and heard so many good things about this book that I was absolutely salivating at the prospect of getting my hands on a copy. Imagine my delight when I walked into my local library and a copy was sitting on the shelf. I scooped it up and hurried home to devour it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, A Discovery of Witches ended up being one of those books that did not live up to the hype. Not even in the least. I will give Deborah Harkness credit for the only thing I can say I enjoyed about this novel: the atmosphere. Harkness created a highly atmospheric novel that was very rich in detail and setting. I truly enjoyed reading about the different places: the old libraries, the ancient manors, etc. Harkness crafted this portion of the novel very well.<br /><br />What I did not like was pretty much everything else. I found the characters to be just terrible. Extremes in the characters are really what ruined them for me. Diana Bishop goes from simpering academic (which I did not like) to over-the-top, all sources of magic in the whole wide world uber-witch. The novel starts off with Diana refusing to acknowledge her witchcraft heritage and powers. Then, her acceptance is thrown into hyper-drive and not only is she an accepting witch, she had every super power known to mankind and a few that have never before been seen. It was way too much. I am highly accepting of magical worlds. Magical worlds make up the bulk of what I read. But when a character goes from a simple, magical creature, to being so over-the-top powerful that is borders on ridiculous, well, you've lost me. This is a prime example of why I stopped reading Laurell K. Hamilton's Meredith Gentry series. I do not enjoy conflated characters.<br /><br />Matthew Clairmont was just meh. He's a vampire, he falls in love with Diana, blah blah blah. I didn't find him engaging or interesting. He was overly macho, which I find repulsive in characters. I get that he is an ancient vampire and maybe he has some older sensibilities, but again, those sensibilities were overblown and made me dislike him.<br /><br />The plot was interesting at first. However, once the plot shifted focus from the magical document to the romance between Diana and Matthew, I couldn't have cared less. Add into that my extreme displeasure with the uber-nature of everything about Diana and Matthew, and it's not shocking why I disliked this novel. Also, this book could have been about 200 pages shorter and still told the same story. Characters were not the only things inflated by Harkness.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I absolutely will not be reading any of the other books in this series. I am very glad I got this book from the library and didn't spend a dime on it. If you feel you must read it, I urge you to check it out from the library or pick up a used copy.ilities were overblown and made me dislike him.  The plot was interesting at first.

B005BGBPBG|4.0|This movie is great for an evening with the girls.  I saw it in the theatre with a good friend and we laughed a lot.  John Krasinski is hilarious, Goodwin and Hudson are likeable and the male lead a nicely subtle fellow (realistic for the part) and easy on the eyes.  Given the protagonist's position, I would've had feelings for both guys.  It was fun to follow the plot and guess where events may turn.  The story followed a path of enjoyable frustration (with some character choices) and it was entertaining the whole way through.  Worth watching, especially if you like the actors and/or romantic comedies.
0307454541|1.0|I don't think there are adequate words to express exactly how much I hated this novel. The description makes this book sound like it is about this weird disappearance and an old man's quest to find out exactly what happened to the young girl. That part was OK, but it wasn't enough to balance out the novel.<br /><br />For starters, there were about 200 pages book-ending the novel of totally unnecessary and boring detail about Blomkvist and his legal problems. It went on and on and on. I almost gave up on this book before I ever got to the mystery portion.<br /><br />I disliked Blomkvist and Salander. I didn't find either interesting or worthy of the hype they receive. I didn't find this entire book worth the hype it received.<br /><br />Once I finally reached the mystery portion of the book, it was a huge letdown. I figured out most of the details of the girl's disappearance long before they happened and I was bored.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I read the second book in this series and I am not even sure why. If you haven't read it and you feel you must, get a copy from the library.

0061245097|3.0|OHEMGEE I LOVE THESE BOOKS SO MUCH!!! So full of awesome girl power, supernatural goodness, BONES (the character, not actual bones), and some sexy times!<br /><br />The unfortunate part about reviewing these books is there isn't a ton to say about them in a review, which stinks because I love them so!!<br /><br />Cat and Bones are an amazing duo. Both are such strong characters, and instead of that being an obstacle between them, it totally works. Cat's mother is crazy, which I also kind of love. I enjoyed Cat's group of soldiers, too. Normally, military-type plots don't work for me, but this one totally did.<br /><br />The plot of this novel was very well crafted. Lots of ass-kicking action, lots of tension between Cat and Bones, throw in Cat's crazy mother and her troupe of soldiers, and someone trying to assassinate Cat, and what is not to love about the plot?!?!<br /><br />These books read very quickly, are tons of fun to read, are very entertaining, and I highly recommend them! If you like Urban Fantasy and you are not reading this series, get on it!
B00005JLCI|4.0|This is probably the best \\"regular\\" adaptation of Hamlet on film, and certainly the best full-text one. Branagh did a number of things right with this film. The first is changing the setting to the 1800s; it is a far enough advance that the clothing is far less flamboyant, and more militant. This prevents the viewer from being distracted by how \\"ridiculous\\" the garments look. It also helps plot-wise; since there were no automatic pistols or automobiles, the carriages, swords and honorable duels still feel in place.  All that being said, this is not a perfect film. Branagh overacts a bit as the Prince, and some characters (like Gertrude) seem almost inconsequential when placed in the background. It's also a mystery why he chose not to show Ophelia at the river, since Gertrude's long monologue describing it is a bit boring without any accompaniment.  Overall, this is a very good film. If you need to watch Hamlet, make it this one.
0307946711|3.0|I picked this book up because I wanted to read it before I saw the movie. I didn't even really know what it was about, so it was a total impulse buy. It ended up being an extremely interesting read for me, for several reasons.<br /><br />First, I don't think I have ever read a book before that was structured, narratively, like One Day. Emma and Dexter meet on the evening of their college graduation. That date becomes the vehicle through which the story is told. Emma and Dexter met on a specific date. What are they doing on that same date, one year later? Five years later? Ten years later? Are they the same people? How have they changed? I sort of expected that whatever events had transpired in the interval of time that we don't read about would then be rehashed to catch the reader up to speed. That is not necessarily what happened and I liked it. Some events were explained, some were merely mentioned and the reader was left to wonder. I can definitely see how some people might not enjoy this type of narrative construct, but I loved it.<br /><br />I also very much enjoyed Emma and Dexter. Because the reader is exposed to the characters at intervals and not in the structure of a conventional narrative, I think knowing these characters could have been rough for the reader. Nicholls handled this aspect of the novel quite adeptly. I loved them, I hated them, I laughed with them, I cried with them. My experience of them as characters was not affected by the narrative construct. Emma and Dexter were wonderfully human. So flawed, so lovely, so completely stupid at time - something I think ever person can relate to.<br /><br />I will say that I think the novel was a titch too long. I'd say 50-75 pages could have easily been shaved off of this story without negatively impacting the tale. I had a sense of some plot points being a bit belabored and I really wasn't down with that.<br /><br />Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I would absolutely recommend it.
0374275637|4.0|By many accounts, Daniel Kahneman is the father of his field, Behavioral Economics, which is a mix between behavioral psychology and traditional economics and has provided perhaps the most fascinating material in recent pop science literature. While this book is no exception in that regard, it is plagued by the same deficiencies that other Behavioral Economics books are plagued by, and so doesn't quite accomplish the potential of the new science.  The premise behind Behavioral Economics is that people are irrational. Countering the standard of the `rational agent model', in which it is assumed that people think and act rationally based on their own interests, behavioral economists have shown that people consistently make decisions that are uneconomical and often self-defeating. The conclusion is that people cannot possibly be rational and that something else is going on.  Daniel Kahneman's thesis is that everyone possesses two systems of thought--the first is automatic, emotional, and intuitive (`fast' as he summarizes it); the second is deliberate, logical, and controlled (`slow'). This dichotomy means that we have the capacity for both reasoning and emotional functions; it also means that we are prone to mistakes. Kahneman shows how the two systems of thought are engaged and what happens when the two mix. Kahneman argues that we define ourselves by our `System 2' slow thinking, but in reality, we are largely governed by our `System 1' fast thinking. This is where a number of cognitive biases and errors come in.  Kahneman's work on these biases is legendary. As a part of a pioneering duo with Amos Tversky, he laid out a number of experiments that show how people consistently make faulty errors in all kinds of situations--at the grocery store, in the classroom, at the voting booth, etc. It is from these studies and other similar work that pop psychology issues such as `anchoring', `framing', `loss aversion', `hindsight bias', and others were introduced. Now--thanksin large part to Kahneman and this book--they are part of our everyday conversations.  Kahneman covers all of these concepts in this book, and does so par excellence since he has had such an integral part in forming them. And, the material is as fascinating as it is in any other Behavioral Economics book. But, as it is with other Behavioral Economics books, the argument is contingent on a number of premises that cannot be assumed, and so conclusions reached end up being far-fetched and rather illogical in themselves.  To begin, the theory has holes. It is argued that, since System 2 is where we conduct our rational choices, System 1 must therefore be non-rational or irrational. And, since we are largely governed by System 1, our actions are based on non-rational processes. But Kahneman does not explain how the different systems arise, nor does he examine what the systems are made up of; he simply shows that people think and make decisions in two different manners. Here, Kahneman shows that System 1 is quick and based on limited information, but this doesn't mean that it is irrational--impetuous and uninformed, maybe, but it still can be based in logic.  One would be right to question the method as well. Kahneman's research is largely based in thought experiments, psychological experiments, and surveys. While this doesn't mean that his conclusions are automatically false, it does mean that his findings are limited--a fact that he fails to guard against.  For example, throughout the book Kahneman would examine an experiment, determining that a group of people acted a certain way under certain circumstances, and then claim that the findings apply to everyone including the reader. An experiment described early in the book showed how a group of people were less helpful on average after being `primed' by the concept of money. Kahneman then says \\"You have no choice but to accept that the major conclusions of these studies are true. More important, you must accept that theyare true about you. If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger.\\" But this is a simple whole-to-part fallacy. Kahneman argues that because a group of people was influenced by a certain prime that all people would be influenced by that same prime. The claim cannot be logically defended--there are exceptions to all of these rules, and so the conclusion cannot be so absolute.  All of the studies and conclusions in this book are subject to similar criticism. This doesn't make the studies uninteresting or banal in any way. On the contrary, the material is that much more interesting when the reader realizes that there is something missing in the analysis. The intellectual agitation encourages a rebuttal in long form, which is on its way. In the meantime, enjoy this survey of some of the most fascinating material on human behavior.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|Well, OK ... but they insisted on doing it over two movies and still felt the need to make things up. I get it that not everything in every book can fit into a movie. But why did they have to make things up that were not even there to begin with -- when the source material was so well written? A few examples: What's with that weird speech of Neville's when the one in the book made so much more sense and in the film it was just odd and maudlin? What's with Harry grabbing Voldemort and saying \\"Let's finish this like we started, Tom, together\\" and hurling the two of them off the bridge? Nowhere in the book; hard to believe Voldemort/Riddle would let Potter get that close, even in his weakened condition. And back to Neville ... ok, he \\"fancies\\" Luna; again, not in the book, but nowhere else in 7/1 or 7/2 is there even a hint that he \\"fancies\\" Luna or anyone else -- in #4 he even goes to the Yule Ball with Ginny. And what's with making McGonigle, after she charms the statues to defend the school, to titter \\"I always wanted to use that charm\\"??? Totally unnecessary and weakens the import of the moment.   Yet I give it three out of five because it looks so good, the performances are first rate, the score is beautiful.  But why, oh why, did Yates, Kloves, et al, even JK Rowling -- who was one of the producers -- feel the need to mess with success?  Sigh.

0895260131|5.0|Islam is not a religion that one worships. It is a way of life that governs who they are, what they believe, how they believe and where they believe it. This \\"faith\\" isolates them from their fellow countrymen and if they support it totally, they cannot support the laws and customs of their native or adopted land. Loyalties are questioned because of what they believe in. One cannot be loyal to America and still be loyal to Islam. They are \\"visitors\\" only in those western nations where their relative numbers are small. Their demands for \\"tolerance\\" in America or Britain or France or Germany or any country that favors the Judeo-Christianity of the west is nothing more than establishing a foothold of shariah law that will eventually lead to a takeover of that nation.  We are in a war for our lives, our beliefs and the future of our culture.

0756404738|5.0|If you liked the first book, you'll love this. It's ambitious & nearly perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed how deeply Rothfuss explained the culture & language of certain races, considering these people/races were from his own imagination, the clarity was stunning. My only gripe was the part of the book with the Felurian as that dragged slightly.   There's plenty of action, magic, a touch of romance & occasionally Rothfuss' prose becomes poetic.   The book was originally slated for a 2008 release but didn't hit the shelves until 2011 and after reading this I can see that Rothfuss took that time getting the book close to perfect. Unfortunately it makes me wonder how long we'll have to wait for the final book in the trilogy tentatively titled \\"The Doors of Stone\\" as I can't wait to see how this is all going to end.
1423140591|5.0|Riordan has a great way of weaving his stories that bring the reader into the middle of them. The most recent I'm his series is no exception.

I am hoping they continue with the Percy Jackson movies.
B000K7UG34|5.0|The 1st Cavalry pioneered the \\"Airmobile\\" concept in Vietnam, utilizing helicopter units as their primary means of conducting combat assaults and troop support. The story is based on the actual 1965 Battle of Ia Drang Valley at Landing Zones X-Ray and Albany, documented in the book \\"We Were Soldiers Once, and Young\\" by Lt.Gen. Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway.  I served with the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in 1968 and 1969 as an Infantryman / Radio Telephone Operator (RTO). This is the only movie of the Vietnam War I've seen that presents things precisely as they were - no exaggeration, no over the top drama....simply a view of reality. I have watched this Randall Wallace movie so many times I know the words by heart.<br /><br />The casting is superb, with Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. \\"Hal\\" Moore, Madeline Stowe as his wife, Sam Elliott as Sgt Maj Plumley, Greg Kinnear as Major Bruce Crandall, Barry Pepper as correspondent Joe Galloway and notable others. There are no weak performances by any of the cast.<br /><br />For any Vietnam Veterans, this movie is a definite Must Watch.<br /><br />Dave Simmons<br />Author - Our Turn to Serve

We need to build and grow our strengths by working on what<br />we are good at.  The world usually tells us to work at what we are struggling with or what we are not good at to improve ourselves.

B001R60ESE|5.0|Chris Botti's music suspends preconceived notions of jazz, pop and all the elevator music in between. Good music is, simply, good music that defies categorization.. And Chris Botti brings energy and passion to his music that is impossible to adequately describe. In addition, Botti surrounds himself with impeccable performances by other artists, understanding that genius not only loves company, but demands it. This Blu-Ray concert pulls you in - from casual observer to fully invested participator. You cannot simply watch this video without becoming involved emotionally, artistically and intellectually. Be forewarned that this concert will spoil you. No longer will you be satisfied by the kind of walmart performances that were good enough before you knew better. Chris Botti in Boston will take you to another level; a higher plain of music appreciation.

A great read for teens as well as adults - I'm in my early 30's and I loved it!  Can't wait to read the other books in the series.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|Flash Gordon is a new perfect example of just how fun movies could be at one time.  It was a reboot of a classic old movie serial and comic book and the writers accepted that.  They played up some of the stereotypes that had been built into the mythos of the character and then found new ways to bring humor and humanity to the characters.<br /><br />It made this moving a fun, if by modern standards \\"campy\\" tale.  Flash is protraryed as a bigger than life hero despite being just a \\"humble\\" quarterback back on Earth.  But viewers are let into the secret right from the start with the over-the-top Queen fanfare/overture.<br /><br />Today a modern producer would push for the series to be darker and \\"edgy\\" much like the TV series which failed quickly.<br /><br />If you love Sci-FI and don't mind a movie where the producers clearly took the idea that they were to entertain first and be serious second very seriously, this is a perfect movie to add to your collection.  If you want something that is designed to make you think and includes all kinds of psychological edges, this movie will drive you nuts.

1451648537|4.0|My first impression of this book is how broad it is in its coverage of the life of Steve Jobs; from the circumstances of his birth; to creating Apple; to leading it to where it is today.  My lasting impression is of a man who is a tyrannical genius.  Despite it's novel-size of 600 pages I would've liked the author to delve more into his failures be it familial, personal and business which are certainly documented but didn't quite elucidate the gravity of Jobs' shortcomings.  For example, he is maybe the only CEO with no inclination for philanthropy. While this is discussed lightly in the book it doesn't examine into why that is and how Jobs' unique role and influence wasn't used for the greater good.  Also, his penchant for undressing employees is quite distasteful regardless of the outcome and he was hardly vilified for this.  The way he would treat restaurant servers, hospital staff and virtually anyone without his title or power was quite despicable.    Ironically, he believed in infusing a human element in all his products such as the iMac being inspired by sunflowers, but he was the least bit human when dealing with nonperfomers; worse yet, given his utter disregard for his family he is about the worst father, husband and family man in the world. The author cites many occasions where Steve is willfully neglectful of his family but is almost apologetic or at least excusatory by weaving some fleeting compensatory comment from his family.   Lastingly, it is hard not to recognize his brilliance and incredible genius!  From his heavy focus on design simplicity; marketing; to somehow despite the lack of humanity in him, reducing his employees to nothing and ultimately motivating them to do things they thought they couldn't.  The man's virtuoso is evident in all his products and the stature of Apple.  I recommend this book but be wary that you might end up disliking Steve Jobs.
B004ZNB12O|2.0|As an earlier reviewer said, the star rating is directed SOLELY at this album, not at any of the music herein or at Pink Floyd in general.  The music itself is absolutely five stars, and only because I can't give it more!  A decade ago in 2001, Pink Floyd released Echoes, a two-disc best-of collection.  This set had just enough of the old Barrett-era Floyd, most of the classics from the modern-day albums, and one semi-rarity (When The Tigers Broke Free, only later added to The Final Cut album in 2004).  While by no means perfect, it at least represented much of the Floyd's history, and included both of the vital early singles, See Emily Play and Arnold Layne.  These two tracks are also on two earlier best-of collections, Relics (1971) and Works (1983).  Works also has one track not available on any other Floyd album, titled Embryo, as well as a different mix of Brain Damage/Eclipse.  A Foot In The Door covers the same ground as Echoes, but far less impressively.  A single disc is never going to surpass a double, but by including nearly all of the same tracks, this set is essentially redundant.  The only tracks on A Foot In The Door but not Echoes are Have A Cigar and Brain Damage/Eclipse.  Being as Echoes is still readily available on Amazon.com and other online outlets, how does one justify purchasing A Foot In The Door?  The public would have been far better served if the Floyd had followed Led Zeppelin's example from a few years back, when Zeppelin released two single-disc compilations titled Early Days and Latter Days.  The Early Days compilation could have been basically Relics and Works intermingled plus a few more album cuts, with Dark Side of the Moon being the cutoff.    The Latter Days compilation could have started with Wish You Were Here.  It could have included, perhaps, a couple of live cuts from Delicate Sounds Of Thunder, Pulse, Is There Anybody Out There?, and maybe even one of the songs from Live 8.    A deluxe set with both discs could have had athird disc of rarities such as Embryo, Apples And Oranges, Come In Number 51 Your Time Is Up and Heart Beat Pig Meat from the Zabriskie Point soundtrack, Raving And Drooling, the alternate version of Empty Spaces from The Wall movie soundtrack, possibly a cut or two from Live At Pompeii, and maybe some more samples from the Household Objects project that never happened.  This would have been the version I'd have bought.   Perhaps the band is out there reading these reviews; if so, guys, I think you'd find my suggestion to be a big seller in your catalog.  In the meantime, I hate to be so harsh on a Pink Floyd release, but this album, in my opinion, is barely a step up from the disaster that is 1981's A Collection Of Great Dance Songs.  Seek out Works, Relics, and Echoes for the good Pink Floyd best-of collections.

The movie definitely isn't a cookie cutter  box office movie, while there is not much in the way of character development it would only get in the way as they build the mythos of the \\"modern day troll\\".
0060775858|5.0|I ordered this book for my grandson, who is 4 1/2 months old; my daughter-in-law says he loves to look at the pictures as she reads the story to him.  The pictures are large and the colors are bright enough to keep his attention. The book is also a great size to hold with also having baby in your lap..

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I almost feel like Stephen King and I are old friends, and have been since I first read Salem's Lot many years ago.  In fact, I think it would be safe to say that I have, with the exceptions of the last Dark Tower books and The Shining - the latter of which so completely freaked me out I have never been able to finish either the novel or either of the two theatrical presentations - rad pretty much everything the Crown Prince of Bangor, ME has written.<br /><br />Not long ago in this column I reviewed the deliciously fun Kindle single, UR.  Even when King doesn't bundle his short stories, they're a blast.<br /><br />Stephen King has demonstrated over the years that you can't pigeonhole him into any genre.  While it is certainly true that horror is his stock in trade, publications like UR, The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon, The Eye of the Dragon, Danse Macabre, and On Writing, just to name a few, clearly demonstrate that when Stephen King steps outside the box he does so with aplomb!  11/22/63 is just such an `outside the box' novel.<br />Jake Epping is a high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine who earns a little extra pocket change teaching adult night classes for those long past their high school years who want to earn their G.E.D.  Once such student is the Lisbon high janitor, Harry Dunning, whose poorly written essay on life changing events touches Jake in ways he never expected.  You might even say that Harry Dunning's watershed moment became Jake Epping's watershed moment.<br /><br />On the night Harry receives his G.E.D. diploma, Jake treats him to dinner at an eatery rarely frequented by Lisbon Falls students and apart from Jake himself, never by the faculty; a little place called Al's Diner, home of the Fatburger.  Over time, Al and Jake have become friends and when the time is both pressing and right, Al invites Jake to experience a hidden mystery in the diner's pantry.  \\"Close your eyes and keep walking - it makes it easier\\" is one of several instructions Al gives Jake.  When he finally opens his eyes, Jake finds himself standing on a spit of land that will one day be Al's Diner's pantry, but whatever piece of 2011 it had been when Jake entered Al's pantry, it is now 11:58 am the morning of September 9, 1958.<br /><br />When Jake returns back to the pantry through what Al calls the `rabbit hole' as in Alice in Wonderland, Al ultimately tells Jake what he wants of him.  Go back through the rabbit hole, stay there for a little over five years, and stop Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating John Fitzgerald Kennedy in Dallas on November 22nd, 1963 - 11/22/62.<br /><br />If I tell you anything else I'll give away too much so I'm going to stop with the story synopsis.  In its place I'll tell you why you want to buy this book.  11/22/63 is perhaps the best piece of writing ever by a master story teller at the top of his craft.  It is none of what I expected from the pen of Stephen King, and yet it is all I could want and more.  Dabbling in science fiction questions about quantum mechanics, time travel paradoxes, and hints of the usual King fare, what you get in the end is a superbly crafted tale that twists in and out of the Oswald mystique, dances around the conspiracy theories, and tosses in a few surprises I never saw coming.  This is vintage King and more.  His first person narrative from the point of view of Jake Epping leaves you with the sense of sitting around the great hall hanging expectantly on every word while The king's master bard wields the sword and staff of his well-chosen words in a story both captivating and emotive.<br /><br />I don't think it would be too much of a stretch to suggest that 11/22/63 may very well be the best work of fiction Stephen King has ever written, and certainly the best thing I have read this year.  Can I give 6 stars out of 5?  It's really that good!<br /><br />Believe me when I say this is the best book of 2011, and quite possibly King's best effort since he began writing.You will not want to put it down, and this is a book you will most definitely add to your `keeper' collection.ely add to your `keeper' collection.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Great series, but way too short. I hope the next one has 18 episodes to make up the shortage of this one!!!
B001HN6922|5.0|My 10 yr old just loves this movie and was overjoyed to see it again. Thanks for the quick download and he loved watching it over and over again
B005HJWWW8|5.0|The Fiio E6 Headphone Amplifier is a great device for those who want louder, better music. The thing that bothered me before I bought this product, however, is the lack of explanation of what the 3 setting equalizer does. There is a small round light at the back of the amplifier showing either red, blue, both, or none (off). The color relates to which equalizer setting is being used: Red is higher bass, blue is even higher volume output, both colors seems to only lessen the volume. When the colors are off, only the amplifier's volume setting affects the music output (Changed with the + and - buttons on the side). With the amplifier's volume on maximum, and the equalizer on blue (higher volume), the total volume output seemed to have been doubled compared to not using the amplifier. Overall, I love this device, I only wish the information I've provided about the equalizer was available before I had purchased it.
