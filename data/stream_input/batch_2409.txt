B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not put down this book love this series. Preordered the sequel.  Similar yo 50 shades but deffinetly kicked up a notch love how scrued up these two chsricters are.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|i'm not a drinker, so for my 21st birthday two of my sisters took me for something similarly embarrassing to a first time raging hangover, this movie was in theaters. honestly i had so much fun with them acting half my age that i bought the dvd when it came out and i watch it when i miss them too much.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book (the movie wasn't s good) and I LOVED the book. Lots of twists and turns and great characters.  I couldn't wait to purchase the next book!
B00000K3D4|5.0|still an amazing film after all these years, one kiddy love that stays fantastic to watch even after growing up.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I really like this book.  It was suspenseful, action packed, and interesting but the end really killed it for me. :(
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beat is my favorite Disney flick ever. i've gone through multiple copies of it in my life, but this time the need to replace was the dog chewing my VHS copy. i wasn't too mad, because honestly, it was a VHS copy, it was about time to upgrade.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Deadwing is my favorite PT cd and one of the best rock albums of all time.  A true masterpiece!!  Thank you Mr. Wilson for sharing your genius.<br /><br />A friend bought a ticket to see him in Chicago Summer 2005 but I hesitated (temporary insanity on my part). I bought Deadwing a week before the show, listened to it about 6 times (very addictive album) and was completely blown away. Luckily I still got a ticket at the last minute and was treated to a fantastic musical and visual show.<br /><br />When he came back to film his DVD in Chicago on 10/12/2005 I was fortunate to see the tour a 2nd time, what a great memory, now on DVD. During the encore, I got carried away a bit and yelled \\"Freebird\\" as a joke. I had no idea it made it to the DVD until years later when a friend told me this had caught on apparently from the DVD and the crowd would chant this at shows. My 5 seconds of fame.<br /><br />Anyway, if you haven't already, buy Deadwing and the Arriving Somewhere DVD, you won't regret it I assure you. Both Classics!! I'm going to see Steve Wilson 5/3/13 for my 6th time, I'm going to try real hard not to yell Freebird, but I can't make any promises:)
B00133KFGW|5.0|i saw this movie in theaters and when asked if it was enjoyable i recommended it to my mother and garbled something along the lines of &#34;it's beautiful and they GET that music is how the soul BREATHES&#34; while trying not to melt down over something ineffable. i watch it when i feel something inexplicable hovering just beyond my understanding- it makes me feel better.
1592407889|4.0|The only child of MacLaine and her husband of  thirty years, Steve Parker, Sachi's surreal childhood began when she was sent to Japan at the age of two--though her mother would sometimes claim Sachi was six--to live with her mercurial father and his mistress. She divided her time being raised by a Japanese governess and going back and forth to L.A. to be with her mother, hamming it up on movie sets, in photo shoots, and Hollywood parties, even winning--and then abruptly losing--the role of Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird. As she got older and attended boarding school in England and Switzerland, became a Qantas stewardess, and  then became involved in  a series of abusive relationships she tried to unravel the mysteries of her childhood and her parents' unconventional marriage.<br /><br />Including twenty never-before-seen personal photos,  [[ASIN:1592407889 Lucky Me: My Life With--and Without--My Mom, Shirley MacLaine]]  is a fascinating look at Hollywood and what it takes to succeed there, the incredible ambition of Shilrey MacLaine and the fallout it had on her only child, as well as a woman's attempt to understand and connect with her extremely complicated parents.<br /><br />As a fan of Shirley MacLaine, I have always been curious about the less publicized aspects of her life, like her daughter, Sachi Parker.  I recall seeing Sachi in bit parts in some movies, and noticed the striking physical resemblance between the two.<br /><br />But so much about Sachi is distinct, unique.  Perhaps growing up in Tokyo and being separated from her mother for large chunks of time informed a lot more about her life than just the obvious elements.<br /><br />In reading Sachi's story, her feelings of loss and abandonment shone through for me.  And perhaps knowing more of the details of what her life looked like and how it felt for her has helped me fill in some of those missing details of MacLaine's life, as well.<br /><br />I like this summing up of Sachi's perspective near the end of the story, when she concludes that she still doesn't understand her mother:<br /><br />\\"It has taken me this long to realize that I don't need to understand her.  She's on her journey, and I'm on mine.  Our lives may intersect at crucial points, but there's no reason to expect them to run side by side, on parallel tracks.  Mom's spirit bounces all over the universe like a jet-powered pinball, and every now and then it settles beside me for a moment before some visionary impulse shoots if off again.  I'm just a stop on the road:  she doesn't need me, not at all, and she isn't going to pretend for propriety's sake that she does.  She's off fulfilling her destiny.\\"<br /><br />It takes a lot of courage to accept the reality of one's relationships, especially those most significant in our lives.  I also like this summing up in the final paragraphs:<br /><br />\\"Looking back over my life, I see that it's full of providential moments, moments of serendipity and grace.  Whenever things seemed desolate, whenever I was poised to capsize, something unexpected always came along to help me out.\\"<br /><br />What I see as I read this story of a woman's journey is that the mother and daughter are not as different as they appear at first glance.  They are each vying for her own place in the world, and doing it on her own terms.  And while some readers will only see the opposing points of view and conclude that someone is \\"lying,\\" I see that life is often like that.  There is your truth, my truth, and the real truth somewhere in between.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|In the image it looks like a hand size, but its really smaller.This product is funcional and portable. Good Stuff
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I order movies on DVD because I love to watch movies in the privacy of my home or on my portable DVD player when traveling. &#34;Django Unchained&#34; was great and I really enjoyed it.  Going to the movies at theatres can be a very unpleasant experience because the audience can be very rude and inconsiderate with their loud, constant chattering or hurting my eyes with that bright light from their cell phone to check their messages.  I also love, love, love watching selected movies in my pajamas!  Whoo-hoo!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I usually won't pay this much for a game but I have to say I feel this was worth the money.<br />The graphics were very well done and the story is interesting although somewhat out there.<br />Long time play and has very good help along the way. All in all one of the best games I've seen.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Love, love, love, love, love, love &#34;Flight&#34; featuring Denzel Washington!  Please rent or purchase this DVD for yourself.  You will not regret it.  &#34;Flight&#34; is better than great!

B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|I loved reading the novel. This was the first Jane Austen novel I have read. I cannot wait to read her other novels.

0920668364|5.0|This is by far the best book I've ever read to my children.  It is such a sweet and touching story, sure to bring a tear to your eye.  I've bought this book several times over the years to give as gifts at baby showers.  All of the new mommies-to-be loved it!  Highly recommended!
B00821OX98|5.0|Anyone that likes Sci Fi will love this series. Hot guys and gals defending the earth as the last resistance to an alien race. Pretty epic if you ask me. Well written and acted. Can't wait for more!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is really nice, and a good improvement from the first Temple Run. Great for when you're bored and have nothing better to do.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I LOVE this game. Sometimes you just need something to do without wanting to think. Great way to bypass the time on a plane.
B000055Y0X|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Peter Sellers was great.  I especially liked watching the actors trying not to laugh at his jokes.  Great movie and I would recommend to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book is in the same category as the first two in the series. Easy to read, quick, and written well enough to keep the reader's attention. It provides a satisfying conclusion to the story introduced by the Hunger Games.
B0090O07S2|5.0|Great to have the complete performance. Interesting story about the resurrection of the 3 previously missing songs. Seriously recommended, even if you have one of the old versions. Haven't watched the bonus features yet.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Easy to read, quick, and written well enough to keep the reader's attention. Its not the sort of book I would usually read, but after the first book, it's difficult not to follow up with the rest of the story.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Hard to get into. Hard to follow. Took over a hundred thirty pages to grab my interest. The ending was disappointing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game cuz of the horses. the horses actually look real, not fake like a lot of games
B0046MOVD0|5.0|Resident Evil is a Zombie Movie franchise I can watch over and over again, not only does Milla Jovovich provide stunning beauty to the franchise, she can act and fight like no other badass!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was really fun and SUPER addictive it keep you on the edge of your seat and has a surprise ending. The hit recharges really fast and if your like me that comes in handy!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I've been with Star Wars since New Hope first showed in theaters, Except for a few things Lucas did to \\"improve\\" on the story and Jar Jar Binks, the Star Wars saga is still one any Sci-Fi fan should own and watch several times and should IGNORE the change in the cantina scene between Han and Greedo, you all should Know what I speak of. Star Wars is still a timeless piece of Science Fiction and will hold a good place in your Library and your heart.
B0041KKYD8|5.0|I've seen the original and this film takes it to a whole different level of rape revenge. The Revenge she gets feels real and justified and you just root for hr the entire time and love when the villains get theirs.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|\\"IO FU[I] G[I]A QUEL CHE VOI S[I]ETE E QUEL CH['] I[O] SONO VO[I] A[N]C[OR] SARETE\\" (I once was what you are and what I am you also will be).  Massaccio chose these words to reinforce the humanist ideas of Lucritius manifiist in the seminal fresco Trinity in Santa Maria Novella,<br /> Florence. Words form ideas that<br />transcend space time leap frogging<br />the millinea continuing to contribute  insight and touch hearts.  From the 5th Century to the 15th to the 21st  into this book.  We are fortunate. Do yourself a favor read The Swerve and On The Nature of Things on which its based. Time well spent.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I've seen everything Chloe Moretz has done and none of it has been bad. You owe to yourself to pick up this Vampire story with a different take on the mythos and a twist that make you think about the true origin of the vampire character played by Chloe. A Must have for Vampire and Horror fans alike as well people who like a little departure from the normal fare of Vampire horror.
1452101248|5.0|I have not even started cooking with these recipes yet even reading them has changed my perception of food, eating, and cooking.
B003B02O7I|4.0|No surprise that Grisham  does it again. A masterful storyteller.  Keeps his readers entertained and evokes a mix of emotions.  Enjoy this book!
B000683VI4|4.0|At this time, I am not able to view the DVD via my computer with Windows 8. If anyone can share helpful hints so I can view this on my desktop, I would appreciate them!
1419705849|5.0|My grandson loves all of the Wimpy Kids books, so I knew this present would be a hit! He will want the next one the day it comes out!
B00BI745AA|3.0|Good acting, but very average singing.  You have to approach it like a movie and not a broadway musical.  That said, I am glad I watched it.
B00BSBXA98|5.0|What a visual gem! The color and performances were excellent. The performers were so so so talented. I enjoyed the unexpected story line. I thought the music was a bit overpowering at times but faded into the background as you became entranced with the visual effects. Worth it in every aspect.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Great 5th movie to a wonderful ending.  Funny yet sad.  Acting was great and music was fantastic.  Everyone needs to see this.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Simple gets better and better!!! I would recommend this series to anyone not just science fiction fans. Great acting great stories.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I was shocked i fell in love with this book. Its like a real life story. I am going to read this again and again
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love this game, I have it on my I-Phone and my Laptop Windows 8, I enjoy the colors and the symbols!
B004UJN1XA|3.0|It seems like an unlikely scenario.  I think the writers go overboard when a lover of their father is tied and gaged just to keep secret that he was homosexual.  It seemed like I was watching a Three Stooges movie.  Maybe I'm not used to dry British humor.
B00A820UF0|5.0|I love mass effect, the universe the story the sound and most of the the art and imagery brought to life by hardworking and inspiring artists ad designers. This purchase was done to support their efforts and its was a worthy investment.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|Game play is basic one you play a game or two you will get the idea. Good enough to pass time but could get old fast, kids will probably like the Penguin's and music.
B00CBBXOQ8|5.0|I have been listening to this album ever since I purchased it. It has a variety of songs that can fit any mood, and I have yet to skip a song. This album is a must have.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love the standing case!  I don't have to hold the Kindle while I am trying to read a book.
B007KW5MFE|5.0|True to the comic book hero Blade comes alive in this epic vampire tale. Bloody, fast paced and great story line makes for one of the best Marvel movies ever made. Not for children due to sex, language and violent content. Once this movie starts you can't take your eyes off of it. Replay value out of 10±-= 10± :)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very good racing book and a great story about a dog and his master from the dog's point of view.
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|thought it was a good depiction of life back then.  A bit slow and took a while to get to the point.  Was engaging in that it affected your feelings.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|Ordered this movie for my son. I love this classic and wouldn't give my copy to my son. A must for your movie collection.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Great look at the history and how the country ran.  A bit slow at times and certainly tons of dialogue and short on action.  I was hoping for more of the Lincoln writing though.  If you enjoy history this will satisfy you.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|THIS IS THE COOLEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!! THIS GAME IS INFINITY TIMES COOL!!! well&hellip;what are you waiting for BUY IT!!!!!!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I like Clancy to be gin with.  This one did not disappoint me.  You did have to think about about who they would get out of the next issue and there were some moments that he got you with the intrigue.  There were other more predictable parts.<br />Overall a good Clancy novel.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is amazing you have so many choices to have allies to fight beside you in battle and in defense . The only thing that sucks is that you need to buy coins to further upgrade your allies into stronger and better allies
B000006UNF|4.0|first things first. he are the cons.<br /><br />1. the production is extremely dated. thin sounding synths and guitars, gate reverb on the drums.<br />2. the dated production is pretty easy to overlook but at times the sound is so boxy it almost sounds like a demo, albeit a good one.<br />3. there are several points when the band sounds like they are 1 step away from breaking into \\"Eye of the Tiger\\".<br />4. the vocalist is so arch sounding at times that you almost feel embarassed for yourself for listening to it. not to mention this is not something you will find yourself listening to with the windows down.<br /><br />with that said the songs are terrific and all are very strong. Fish's vocals are most definitely quite over the top at times but his singing is the highlight of the album and the group's most distinctive feature. the band is called \\"neo-prog\\" for a reason though. the more mellow sections, ie \\"Garden Party\\", tend to resemble classic 70s prog, ie early Genesis, while the more uptempo parts are 80s all the way. while Fish most definitely sounds a bit like Peter Gabriel(a bit of Peter Hammill too) I would not necessarily recommend this to someone who enjoys classic early 70s British prog.<br /><br />but whatever do not take my word for it. this is definitely a great album but curious listeners coming from a 70s prog background just need to be forewarned that while this is great stuff if you buy expecting \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" or \\"Pawn Hearts\\" you may disappointed but that is more of a case of people mis-categorizing Marillion than anything else
B008602KQI|1.0|I don't get this movie at all. It sucks on every level. Bad camera work doesn't make a good movie.
0061537969|5.0|Haven't you ever wondered what your dog is thinking? What you would feel/see/smell/hear/experience if you could be in your dog's mind?  Oh my goodness. I couldn't put it down, it took me a day and a half to finish. Beautifully written from the perspective of the dog, the clever and descriptive nature of this book really makes you feel like you're right there with him. It's funny, it's sad, it's angering, it's loving, it's full of raw emotion and unshaken loyalty from man's best friend. This book takes you through the roller-coaster ride of life through the dog's eyes, and it's one of my absolute favorite novels to date. I can't say enough about this, just read it. :)
B005FITIGO|5.0|Hands down the best Wall Street movie ever made.  All-star cast, sophisticated dialogues, and cold-hearted realism make this the new gold standard for Wall Street movies.  Bravo!
B003V5CFV8|5.0|This movie is so good, it's hard to explain in just words. It's funny, thoughtful, an outright masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, buy it - you will not regret it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game sooooooooo much there are no problems at all. Please make more temple runs.It works perfectly on my kindle fire. It's one of my fave apps in the world. Thnx for making it.(:  (;  (=  {:  {=  {;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #1app
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely loved this story and it could easily have been a series worth your time to read I suggest you reading it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Nintendo fans may cry foul at the obvious parallel between Lep's World and Mario World, but it's fun enough to play and you can't beat free.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great story! I couldn't put it down! It shows once again that love concurs all! Grasps human emotion in the best way.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I loved this movie with Gywneth Paltrow.  It's a fun, entertaining piece and the scenery is brilliant.  If you like period films as I do, this is one you won't want to miss.
B00AECGQF2|2.0|As adult I did not enjoy this at all I am a dog groomer by profession and thought it might be fun,get one out there that you can groom your pet and I will like it, It just wasnt for me cute tho
B00AWQEKIK|4.0|First of all, let me say that I'm a huge Stephen Stills fan. So when I read that this box set was coming out I thought it was about time.I was really impressed with the very 1st track of him at 17 years old. Wow! I was never much of a fan of the 1st Buffalo Springfield album but the mixes on those tracks changed my mind a bit.I have always said that &#34;Buffalo Springfield Again&#34; was the best American album of 1967, bar none.And what can you add to Crosby, Stills & Nash that hasn't been said before? ( Boy, listen to &#34;See the Changes&#34; on this set will make your hair stand up!) But where's my beef? When I was younger( many, many moons ago) one of the most pivotal records I heard was &#34; Super Sessions&#34; with Al Kooper, Steve Stills and Mike Bloomfield. A cut from that should have been featured on this box set as well a cut or 2 with Judy Collins. ( I know he didn't sing on these songs but his guitar work was soooo great!) Maybe i am bias because the Super Session album was a big influence on me, but still I think the set is missing some great Stills performances. Other than that, I highly recommend this well deserved box set.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|First saw Jessie perform on my local PBS channel and kew I had to hear more. Great tempo the gets your heart pounding. I want more.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Was short as some said but was so cool it didn't matter and it still took me a few hours. I can't wait for the sequel. Really unique. If you like trying to figure out puzzles this game is for you.
1451695195|5.0|The ultimate Near Death Experience as the definitive case for life after death from a former scientific genius and skeptic who &#34;saw the light.&#34;
1451627289|5.0|Loved this book!  Best Stephen King novel in a while.  Such a cool concept for a story, and SK is the best guy to have tackled this idea.  Considering how many times he goes from past to present and how easy it is for writers to get all tangled up in loose ends when writing about time travel, I thought he did an amazing job of tying everything together by the end in a way that was satisfying.  Definitely worth a read!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging but reasonable puzzles with no hidden object foolishness. A bit short but only 2 bucks. Totally worth it. Can't wait for the next chapter.
B0063GORYU|5.0|fun but addictive!  It's not easy enough to be boring and not so hard as to be frustrating.  I recommend this app to all ages.
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|I will usually be familiar with at least 3 songs on a CD before I buy it. I went in blind with this one and am pleasantly surprised. There is only one song I'm not very fond of. The entire album had been repeating on my Ipod for days. I could kick myself for not buying sooner!
B007NVIB5U|4.0|I really enjoy this show. My gay friend told me that it's similar to The L Word, but I dislike. They are a lot alike, but not quite. I like all the sex scenes. Definitely don't watch in your college's student center with people behind you, unless you don't care.
B0083GDLL8|5.0|I first heard this in highschool and I still love this album.  I don't think that any more than that needs to be said other than to reach Amazon's minimum word limit.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I say &#34;so far&#34; because I sure hope she keeps putting out music.  I love her jazz interpretations.  She won't disappoint you!
B007SUW24W|5.0|This is the thinking-man's Justin Timberlake. Its got soul and spunk, and the lyrics are tight for those who need that added flavor to their music.
B0096C7QF0|5.0|Caught the show on TV and had to have the album... I'm NOT disappointed.. Great album as his music always is...
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Perfect for when just a simple calculator is needed. I use it on a regular basis &amp; have for months now. At one point out started doing strange things and I had to download it again and it was fine that is why I'm giving it only 4 stars instead of 5.
B0081JDMUW|5.0|I discovered Beth Hart when she did a gig with Joe Bonamassa and I thought she was great with him. This is her latest album and was also the first I bought. I have since bought two more since then, &#34;My California&#34; and &#34;Screamin For My Supper&#34;. All three of these albums have a thread of familiarity but for the most part all seem to be completely &#34;ground up&#34; productions. I love them all!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I'd heard so much about it, but needed to see it to understand what it was all about.  I can't wait for the sequel.
B0037BB00I|5.0|I love this album.  When I'm driving long distance, I always seem to dial up the album and her &#34;21&#34; to help the miles fly by.
B000002LHX|4.0|If you want the complete Batman score and soundtrack to the classic 1989 movie, then buy this CD (Batman Motion Picture Soundtrack by Prince) and also the Batman Original Motion Picture Score composed by Danny Elfman.  This soundtrack by Prince is good, but not worthy of 5 stars.  It's 4 stars at best.  I used to have this album on vinyl back in 1989.  I bought the CD back in 2007.<br /><br />Here are the songs:<br /><br />1. The Future<br />2. Electric Chair<br />3. The Arms Of Orion<br />4. Partyman<br />5. Vicki Waiting<br />6. Trust<br />7. Lemon Crush<br />8. Scandalous<br />9. Batdance<br /><br />My favorite songs are \\"Partyman\\", \\"Trust\\", \\"Scandalous\\", and \\"Batdance\\".  Jack Nicholson's laugh at the beginning of \\"Batdance\\" at the 0:07 second mark sounds exactly like one of Cesar Romero's laughs from the 1960s TV series, but I don't recall that particular Nicholson laugh being used in any scene in the movie.  Romero was a trailblazing and highly influential Joker, so it's possible Nicholson was experimenting with Romero's laugh.  The song \\"Scandalous\\" is played during the closing credits in the movie.  I don't know, some of these Prince songs didn't quite fit the movie, yet the stuff is easy to listen to and accept.<br /><br />Just for the record, I like the 1989 Batman movie WAY better than The Dark Knight (2008).  The Joker in The Dark Knight, played by Heath Ledger, just wasn't The Joker at all.  Instead, it was just some psychopath who was wearing clown makeup.  He wasn't funny, he was way too serious (hey, Heath - why so serious?), and above all, Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy in general was just waaaaaaay too serious, thus not permitting The Joker to use the classic Joker gadgets like a hand buzzer and squirting lapel flower.  Nolan sucked all the fun out of Batman with his Law & Order/NYPD Blue/CSI feel to the movies.  He created such real world settings, yet we have Batman and Rachel Dawes falling 25 stories from a building and not getting killed (in fact, not even injured), we have Harvey Dent walking around with half a face, we have Harvey Dent flipping over a car and not getting injured or killed, we have a horse that breathes fire, we have a mask that has bats flying out of it, I can go on and on and on.  The plot holes in all three movies are numerous.  Another thing - all I see in these movies are tons of cops, tons of cop cars, cops in riot gear, and SWAT teams galore.  If I want to see this kind of stuff, all I have to do is turn on the news, like CNN for example, or watch the above mentioned shows.  Basically these movies are crime dramas that happen to include a guy called Batman, which makes a guy who dresses up as a bat look ridiculous and totally out of place.  Tim Burton, the director of Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) got it right.  His movies were true comic book movies with a comic book feel to them, thus requiring the audience to suspend disbelief.  If I see a guy on the screen who dresses up as a bat, I know it's not something in real life, it's something from a comic book movie.  If I see somebody in everyday reality dressed as Batman, I can assure you it's only in late October or on the day of a comic book convention.  Every time I watch the 2008 movie and then immediately watch the 1989 right after, I always say to myself while I'm watching the 1989 movie, \\"Now THIS is a Batman movie.  Now THIS is The Joker.  Now THIS is Gotham City.\\"  If I'm going to watch a Batman movie, the movie should allow me to escape reality and entertain me for a couple of hours, not remind me of reality and above all, totally mirror everyday society and take itself so seriously.  These are just some of the reasons why Burton's movies are better than Nolan's movies.fact, not even injured), we have Harvey Dent walking around with half a face, we have Harvey Dent flipping over a car and not getting injured or killed, we have a horse that breathes fire, we have a mask that has bats flying out of it, I can go on and on and on.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|I got this app and LOVED it. WARNING!!! After about a week of playing it on my kindle fire it would not let me back in the app to play it:(  And not like &quot;Sorry game is not working force close&quot; either. It would get to the loading screen and without any warning take me back to the home menu.  Just be careful if u get it on the kindle fire.  Great game though.

B005NF2UE6|4.0|The State, The Long Road, All The Right Reasons (excluding the pathetic \\"Rock Star\\" song) and Silver Side Up are my favorite albums by Nickelback. This one, although good it is not their best. Themes of sex, drugs, women are a recurring theme in their 3rd straight album. It gets kinda old at a point if they keep releasing albums dealing with this but still, Nickelback is best and better than many other rock groups out there today.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is an amazing show with fantastic characters. Each episode is great on its own, but the overall story is what makes the show awesome.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Acting was superb. Excellent movie. I am very difficult to please and I must say it had me going the whole way. Excellent example of just the right amount of adult content w/o all the sex and overdone violence. Perfect, Bravo.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Both an interesting historical perspective and emotional insight into human nature. Wonderfully, evocative of slave, indentured servants and plantation life.

B00A8V3VVG|5.0|If we were to place ourselves back in time, I believe this is how many of us would like to react to slavery and its horrors. On one side it gives us a sense of its complete acceptability in its time. On the other we are able to go back in time in this movie and correct the injustices but in a very violent way.<br /><br />Great music. Sometimes have to turn away from screen at some of most violent scenes.
B005LAIGIM|5.0|this is a good move. show how some people need to watch how they do and act as much what come out of their mouth can do for you
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Go back in time when slavery was culturally acceptable to some. Get to be the person from our world today to go back in time and correct the horrors of slavery. But carry out that mission by using that same violence on the culture that created and maintained it.<br /><br />Really well done. Intense. Great landscape photography. Awesome sense of the period  . Great music.
B000O1799U|5.0|This a great music picture you need to add to your selection. I love this one too and hope you get it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Enjoyed this book so much that ordered her other two novels.  I liked Sharp Objects, but Gone Girl is much more complex and riveting.  Do yourself a favor and read this one!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Head and shoulders above 99% of games on Android platform. It is not perfect though, but I am trying to even out things from the bad reviews that are not deserved, so 5 stars instead of 4.<br /><br />The innovation is crazy. I could play all day just on the menu screen. The levels are so fun to solve in different ways. Like the Knight and the lake: first I killed the shark with an orca or two, then I swam across and gave the Knight a Pegasus to ride on, because he is not keen on dragons or griffins.<br /><br />I like the levels where I can solve things my own way. Not crazy about the levels where I have to chose three specific items from a list the game has in mind.<br /><br />Some people in reviews said they could not make items. This is because there is a very clear enter button next to the word that does not work at all on two devices I own, one high end, one midrange. I have to push the enter game on the phone keyboard, and it works fine.<br /><br />Other small issues: you are limited in changing your environment. I can't make an ocean or a lake to ride a boat in. I can flood the place, but it kills my character, even when he is in a boat.<br />It is difficult to pick up small items. The touch controls seem a bit off.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|my five year old LOVES this game and is actually pretty good at it. Just challenging enough and quite entertaining. recommend this one.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|When will the first Pendergast movie be made, his fan are waiting, and who will play the part of Pendergast .
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|you now how you get lots of games.you ditch your games because you play different games.so i<br />just. love this game.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I love the way Nicholas Sparks writes, real love have a dark side  and true lover must walk though that darkness to became one with each other.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|no problems with the game, I have enjoyed playing the game very much, I will and do recommend it to my friends.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|this book will allow you to explore the person you are hiding and live the life you always wanted.<br />words with out action is just empty words, so become  activity in your words and live your true self.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Don't know that I would have picked up this book (that's why book clubs are so good) but truly enjoyed it. Serious subject, but stories woven together very well. Some characters better portrayed than others, but overall a good read.
0670026603|5.0|I saved this to read while I had a few days on my own last holiday. A relevant story that has stayed with me. Perfect.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|A flashback or throwback to earlier days. Here, we have Jack still in the Army. The novel harkens back to earlier times in his life (1997) and the reader gets a good idea of how he adopted his present day lifestyle.<br /><br />The novel is set in a very small backwater town in Mississippi whose only claim to existence is an obscure, very large army base. Jack ties up with the town's sheriff, a woman who is both beautiful and ex-Marine. Together, and with help of some of his army cohorts, they set about trying to solve a string of local murders.<br /><br />As a Reacher novel, not the best. But, certainly entertaining and worth your time. Jack in his earlier days, but still with novel, no-nonsense ways of taking care of business
B00881PTRC|4.0|good game.  makes you think.  We all need that.  animation is funny the first few times.  The little guy has an attitude but you can't blame him.  Works on my Asus TF700.
0525478817|5.0|This is a story of love, of life, of death and of all the things that make them worth it.  While most sixteen year old girls carry a designer backpack, sixteen year old Hazel Grace Lancaster carries a portable oxygen tank.  Diagnosed at age thirteen with Stage IV Thyroid Cancer that spread to her lungs, Hazel takes an experimental drug that has prolonged her young life.  Still terminal, she's been living her last years dying.  Her parents have become her best friends and her best friend is becoming a stranger.  Forced to go to a Cancer Kids Support Group in The Heart of Jesus at a local church, Hazel meets Augustus Waters, a seventeen year old former basketball star who wears a prosthetic leg from the knee down due to a bout with Osteoscarcoma from which he is now in remission.  Their relationship blossoms and they bond over a book called An Imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houton, about a young girl battling cancer that just ends without explanation.  Did the young girl die?  Was she too sick to continue to write her story?  Seeking answers from the author who lives now in Amsterdam as a recluse in a state of constant drunk, Hazel and Augustus embark on the journey of a too short lifetime. ✰✰✰✰✰
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Nice thriller with suspenseful ending. I recommend this book to those that enjoy legal thrillers. Nice spring time read! You will enjoy the book!
B004UBB3KQ|5.0|Great artist to listen to on vinyl and the added digital copy was awesome so you can listen to it anywhere!
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|There were some items that I had no idea how to get. It would be nice to have tips or some sort of hint as to how you could nab them.
1616550414|5.0|My boyfriend is a HUGE Zelda fan, so this book was perfect for him. It had background history on the games, the characters and how Zelda first came about - with tons of amazing pictures included! I would say its a Zelda fan must-have.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I found this looking for something completely different.  Lucky me!  If you enjoy tennis and games, it's a win win.  The only bad part of it.....my timing of my swing.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|A must-have for all Harry Potter fans! Includes all movies, along with extended scenes about the movie, actors, filming, etc. My whole house has enjoyed countless hours of entertainment with this purchase - and at an amazing price!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|been a daria fan for as long as I have been a beavis and butthead fan glad they finally released the whole series
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|A must read, i started reading and couldn't stop. I highly recommend it. More than a novel this is an educational master piece.
0880796863|5.0|it's ok.
B005PK57NU|5.0|The good wife is a good show. The smart humor, the great cast including the regular (Christine Baranski, Alan Cummings, Matt Czuchry, etc) and guest (Michael J. Fox, Matthew Perry, and many others) stars. A good balance of wit, drama, intrigue, and tongue-in-cheek social commentary.
1401937268|5.0|it's ok.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I've been disappointed with the changes made to Yahoo! Mail over the past couple of years, but this app is surprisingly functional and useful. I use Yahoo! Mail for business and have multiple accounts. The app allows you a to sign into different Yahoo Mail accounts and switch between them. You will also receive incoming mail notifications on your Kindle Fire. I have yet to compose/send mail via this app, though, but for what I use it for, I was pleasantly surprised.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|The Maiden England concert is Maiden at their prime when it comes to energy. They are at their fastest, and as Nicko says in the disc two documentary they'e so fast, \\"Bruce can barely sing the song!\\") Though I would argue their songs have matured well and slower versions of their hits allow a richer sound (exactly what Adrian Smith was looking for before he left the band- of course they found their way back). My highlights here are the songs from Seventh Son: Moonchild, Infinite Dreams, and Seventh Son in particular are excellent. The version of Hallowed is also among the best I've ever heard. Bruce is great as always, though I could argue he's only gotten better with time. Steve's bass stands out on this concert as the foundation for the songs. Steve and Adrian go back and forth as two of the best guitarists in metal. The drums steal this show and Nicko really stands out as the leader of the songs and take you into some primal zone.<br /><br />Disc two gives you a bonus selection of documentaries. History Part 3 is great and 12 Wasted Years has some great old footage from the earlier years (if you never seen them this is worth the price alone). The videos are good too if you've never seen them, but they're quite silly. I'm really waiting for a CD box set with bonus unreleased material, but that's another story. Maiden England was an important part of this band's history and I'm glad they rereleased it, since my old VHS copy was given away at a garage sale years ago.
B006QSL9XC|4.0|The film only decribes a few of the battles that took place ine Gettysburg over the 3 days.  So this is not a full accounting.  Having just visited Gettysburg National Park, the battles and carnage are still difficult to imagine, and the film only partly explores this.  It's also got a dramatic flair and, I think, General RE Lee (Martin Sheen) seems a little too pie-in-the-sky Southern idealist to be perceived as a great tactican and important General.  All that said, the movie is one of the best depictions of the Civil War.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|truly a magnificent and beautiful read.  I've  read this multiple times and it never gets old. wish he would come out with a new book
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love this movie!!! Saw it opening day with family on the BIg Screen, we were singing along under our breaths the entire score. Tears at the end, even my 83year old father was tearing up! Loved it just as much on my home screen.
B00881VLCE|5.0|i like to work all kind of puzzles, i do all size of puzzles also. i would like to see different pictures.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|enjoyed this movie very much great special effects, beautiful scenes, great story line, the animals look so real, would watch this again
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I can't believe the difference this book and the techniques have made for my hair!  I used the Deva products before - but without knowing the techniques she describes in the book, I wasn't getting the results I was looking for.  Now, my hair hasn't looked better.  Love it!
B003A2JBIM|5.0|I just wish they had these when I was a kid!!! I always wanted to replicate my favorite scenes growing up, and you're never too old for Legos!
B0073COMKW|5.0|This Led Light bulb is truly bright and I'll say it is close in lamination to a 60 Watt light bulb. This light only used 10 Watts of power. The light is a bright white light not a warm white light like the LED Light bulbs with sulfur filter in them. However it is not a bright blue white light like some other cheaper LED Lamps.
B001U3ZMH2|5.0|I just wish they had these when I was a kid!  Growing up on Star Wars I was constantly doing everything I could to replicate my favorite scenes, good thing you're never really too old for Legos.
B00CAJP0ZO|1.0|There is nothing unique nor exciting about this album that will make it stand out from Will.I.Am's previous efforts as a solo &quot;artist&quot; or when he was an active member of Black Eyed Peas for that matter.<br /><br />I'm not going to go in-depth on this album with my review.<br /><br />For the most part, this album is a sad attempt by Will.I.Am to simply make some money by cashing in on the growing popularity of EDM here in the United States.  Some of the beats and sound arrangements from his tracks are one of the following two items:<br /><br />1) Stolen from other artists without clearance from their respective record labels.  There's a difference between sampling and stealing.  P. Diddy, Kanye West and Jay-Z samples other artists' music only after they asked permission and received the consent and clearance by both the artists and their respective record labels.  Will.I.Am doesn't do that.  He simply steals and pleads ignorance.  He's done that with lots of his music in the past as a solo artist and when he was part of Black Eyed peas.  google it online and you will find what I meant.<br /><br />2) Tired rehash of his previous works.  Instead of auto-tuned Fergie whining along Will.I.Am's rapping, you're going to get an auto-tuned Britney Spears instead layered over sounds you would have heard 5 years ago.<br /><br />You won't get much from this album except for generic pop music meant for playing on Top 40 radio or parties attended by 19 year olds.<br /><br />Will.I.Am doesn't have the creativity nor genius of a producer/artist like Pharrel Williams.<br /><br />If you like boring and uninspired music, then this is for you I suppose. Enjoy.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|Since this is a review of the movie, not of Disney's marketing practices, I'll have to say the movie is visually stunning, but the story itself, and the acting, are really lame. If they give awards for bad dialogue and overplaying the part, it would win several. Not destined to go down as a classic, that's for sure.
B002WJI65S|5.0|Very well made. The details are great, quality is really good, and it is really cute. Love it, getting them all
B001VNB54A|5.0|This is the perfect companion to the other HBO series, \\"Band of Brothers\\", which tells  the true story of Easy Company, 101st Airborne Division which landed behing German lines on June 5, 1944. Unlike \\"Band Of Brothers\\", you won't see interviews of the surviving men of Easy Company. Instead, you will see old World War Two photos of each of the half dozen or so Marines which the movie concentrates on who fought and died from Guadalcanal to Okinawa and the actors who portray them. Once again, Tom Hanks is the Executive Producer of \\"The Pacific\\" as he was with \\"Band Of Brothers\\".
B0091REZMW|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It is highly addictive... You will be constantly playing it and forgetting things like work etc...
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This series never fails to deliver on entertainment and viewing pleasure.  If you're a WWI buff you will particularly find this opening episode of interest, for the WWI scenes are quite good and have excellent attention to detail.  A great TV series it is!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|GOOD STORY LINE. ENTERTAINING. HELD MY ATTENTION AND COULD NOT WAIT FOR MORE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR MY MOTHER IN LAW

B008AITJ24|5.0|I HAVE ALL OF THE SEASONS SO FAR.  IT HAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SERIOUS DRAMA AND COMIC RELIEF.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Most directions are clear. Even I could use it. I ran into trouble with the table of contents. It only wanted to upload 2 chapters. Very frustrating. I still don't know what I did wrong. I had to resort to extra help. The rest was concise and idiot proof. All in all, a very handy little book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app! Thank you, Mojang for creating Minecraft for mobile devices! I love the Minecraft  PC edition, and this is just as good! I do know that 0.7.0 is coming out soon, and there is the addition of Redstone coming soon. I really hope that Minecraft - Pocket Edition will evolve to be one of the best games of all time, played on a mobile device. For now, five-star app for sure!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie was well done... Kept my interest throughout .. I wasn't wild about the ending, but then realized they left it open for a possible sequel? Anyway, I will watch the next one too.. Very good movie.<br />Thanks for making it available ...
B00CHIMG6Y|1.0|Anybody who places any value on their time will be better off avoiding this movie. An Oscar for this movie is like....Obama winning the Nobel peace prize.<br /><br />Another colossal work of cinematic dung exiting Hollywood.
0812984412|5.0|Loved the book. Loved the movie, too. Definitely worth immersing yourself into. New cult classic, in my opinion. I personally grew attached to some of the characters and found myself wanting more.
B0094KTAEY|5.0|Easily one of the greatest animated pictures I have ever seen.  When will Amazon Instant start carrying the Miyazaki classics?
B00006AW2J|5.0|I loved this album when it came out, but it sounds so much better on this CD then I could have ever imagined. I must have for Stones Fans
1451695195|5.0|I think Dr Alexander has been through an amazing experience. And I appreciate that he looks at it as a physician, a scientist, a medical viewpoint, and mostly a soul as it leaves the body. I love reading different experiences of life after life. I think it's a different experience for each of us. I went through my own spiritual experiences; but I didn't die or even come close to it. I sent a copy to my brother and his wife.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to dive into Book 3! Suzanne Collins has created a heroine that is frustrating, impetuous, and undeniably brave as she fights toward an uncertain end.
B006PTZNSY|3.0|Well I got it today it's okay it don't sound like nicki she sounds different ... Not one of my fav
0425252868|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my brother who reads many WWII books. He said he couldn't put it down. It is well written, interesting, and is a very personal point of view of those in the war planes.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I recommend this book to all mystery-thriller-suspense lovers.  Well written; kept me on pins and needles till the end--which absolutely blew me away.  Was not expecting that!  It was made into a movie, which I watched, and was pleasantly surprised that they stuck pretty closely to the book.  However, in the end the book was better, more exciting. I haven't yet read any more of Dennis Lehane's works, but want to; and I hope they are as good as this one.
B009ZOCLD6|5.0|Astonishingly not everyone seems to have given this its' due-which is rightfully more than 5 stars. This playing is so beautiful, so sublime, that it now ranks as one of the greatest CD concerto performances in the repertory. Having heard these same artists in Carnegie Hall recently, perhaps this doesn't quite compare-if only because the depth of tone and power of the Dresdeners can only be truly appreciated live, but it's darn close. Normally the last movement comes as an afterthought to me, but not here. Batiashvili plays the actual Joachim Strad for which Brahms wrote the concerto-and the sound of her instrument, coupled with her incredibly nuanced flexible bowing, tone and phrasing, puts most of the other recordings to shame. Thielemann drives the orchestra and just relishes the big climactic moments, but not to the impoverishment of the more lyrical ones. A true masterpiece.
1885167776|5.0|\\"The One Thing\\" by Keller and Papasan is well presented and I think this is the first time I've read a book where the author(s) underlined the significant sentences and points.  This underlining is aptly done, which makes this helpful book also a succinctly quick-read.  There are also plenty of examples and anecdotes underlying and supporting the points the authors make.<br /><br />I think many of the concepts in \\"One\\" are already intuitively known by adults. (In addition, the widely known Pareto Principle is noted and \\"10,000 hours to Mastery,\\" the latter penned a couple of years ago by Malcolm Gladwell.)<br /><br />I agree with the authors that yes, there is way too much multi-tasking today and too much minutiae that clutters up our main objective(s) at work and home.  One of the reasons for this detrimental multi-tasking and needless clutter is current technology and in particular certain technological *devices.*  A lack of time in work and life, and job duties that nuance too many things - trivial things - that obstruct us from reaching our important goals. I (and many of us agree) that multi-tasking is not a good concept to begin with, and it should *not* a desired skill.  The main question presented by Keller and Papasan: What is the one thing  you can do - and just by doing it - will make everything else easier and/or unnecessary?<br /><br />Some points that can help certain readers are the Lies. There are 6 lies listed and detailed. Commonly held beliefs (by some/many people) that are not only false but detrimental.  One lie noted by Keller and Papasan is \\"Everything Matters Equally.\\"  Personally, I've never held the different proportions of things in my life equally,  I also have gleaned insight into the Lie that \\"A balanced life in required.\\"  It's not required.  Nothing in reality is balanced, but we do categorize things into different portions of our \\"life pie chart\\" based on priority (or convenience).<br /><br />The lie of \\"success requires self-discipline:\\" On the concept of self-discipline Keller and Papasan correctly note that  people who are successful often do not have an extraordinary amount of self-discipline.  Some do; many don't.  We often do not need more self-discipline - we already have it.  We just need to manage our time better.<br /><br />Some old adages are also considered false such as the \\"boiling frog syndrome.\\"  I do like the authors' critique of the ubiquitous and obligatory (at least for me) \\"to-do lists.\\"  They note that most actions listed are unimportant things that we need to get done - because they are on the list.  Good point!  Instead of \\"to do\\" some of these items on our list should have a \\"should\\" written on that line of action on the list.<br /><br />Dominoes:<br /><br />The Geometric Progression of a Domino: The author define Geometric Progression as: \\"a long, long, train - it starts out too slow to notice until it's moving too fast to stop.\\"<br /><br />The practical and helpful aspects of \\"The One Thing\\" are for you to set up your own individual life Dominoes, categories them, and chunk them down.  However, you first need to find the first Domino to knock down.  Once you do this, rest will fall.  Once sent in motion, the dominoes will do the work for you.  It's effective time and task management.<br /><br />I think this book can help people who are newer to books on Time Management and want or need to focus on important areas of life.

B008K9SG9K|5.0|My daughter, trained in classical music for years, asked me to purchase this album a while ago. At first I hesitated. I changed my mind only after listening to &#34;Demons&#34; on the radio. We just received it a few days ago. After listening to the entire album the first time, I realized what an awesome album Imagine Dragons has released. Now I am a fan, too!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Go into this movie looking for a non-thinking action escape and you will enjoy it. Now if you're looking for some documentary or are disappointed about how they betray Lincoln you have clearly missed the Vampire Hunter part of the title. Lincoln fights off a vampire nation as well as slavery in this movie. While I personally enjoyed it..I did find the level of CGI used to be a bit over done at times but overall a good escape from reality if only for a while.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|as always this ice age continues the hilarious story of our characters and adds a few more... good story line
B0038P59A0|4.0|Robert Downey Jr....yes that is right this is not Iron Man. He does a great job in this movie. I found it entertaining and light hearted but interesting enough to keep you watching. Ego characters are Downey's Niche...he does characters with big egos wonderfully and does not disappoint here.
B005LAII9O|5.0|saw this on the big screen.. loved it there and now love this version too... will watch again and again...
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Initially I was pulled in and did not want to put the book down but eventually I became bored with the writers redundant descriptions.  If the writer cut out the repetitiveness, this story could have been told in one book.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|been a big fan of the first MIB and now I can add this to that list.. good story line and great characters..
B008ENNXQI|1.0|streaming rate was awful.  stopped watching after watching the wait circle about 20 times. tested my broadband, was good. must be on amazons end???
B0087ITBPC|4.0|\\"The Guilt Trip\\" is one of those simple little light dramas that is a sweet confection of a film. Seth is totally at ease working with entertainment icon Streisand. And Barbra's character, Joyce, is anything but a superstar. Barbra as Joyce is lovely and kind and vulnerable. And totally middle class! Note: Streisand, a stickler for detail, I'm sure designed her own makeup. No iconic Barbra Streisand movie star eyes; look closely for liquid eye-liner applied like Joyce would do! Barbra sparkles, Seth is deliciously befuddled as they look for love -- in their strained relationship and with long-lost love. What a charming pair! This film isn't going to make any big philosophical statement or change the world. It's just 90 minutes of low-key fun about a mother who adores her boy.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The story of what we know and what we don't know about our children can be chilling. An emotional tale
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I loved this book the twists and turns shocked and surprised me!  I. Would recommend this  book as a great read.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|It was great ! exciting nearly throughout.  Lots of human emotion.  Reading captions was not a problem. I will watch it again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was a heartwarming story in the true form of Nicholas Sparks.  The characters were real and the action thrilling.  It was a page turner that I didn't want to end!
B008602KQI|3.0|I never read the book, so I'm unbiased in that aspect.  Now I watch a lot of films and I have a wide range of genres in which I appreciate, and in this fantasy, sci-fi, adventure, drama many things are lacking to making this a good flick.  It's been over a week now, between watching the movie and me writing this &#34;review,&#34; so I may have forgotten some things.<br /><br />The Hunger Games does a poor job at setup.  I'll assume the book does better to explain just what the heck is going on.  Sure the film doesn't leave you completely in the dark, but it lacks any detail required leave you feeling unquestioning about this unfamiliar primitive yet futuristic world.  It seems as though the world has reverted back, in the way of human compassion and idealism, to ancient Rome.  Fast forward to the games.  Again, maybe the book does a better job, or maybe not, but there isn't really much setup and connecting to the non main characters who take part in the games to allow the viewer to connect with them.  When one of these folks dies, you're left uncaring.  There is really only one true villain in the games whom the audience can hope for his demise, despite the fact that 17 other people are trying to kill our heroine.  What's with the government?  What's with the super smart, super fast, and super silent girl who kills no one, is so smart yet gets poisoned by eating berries that even Katniss knew to be poisonous.  We know all players were being tracked by the government, so why didn't they mess with this stealthy girl who wasn't killing anyone but could follow the other players, silently stalking them without being detected?  Why was Katniss the only one receiving help in the way of mystery pods which seemingly came out of nowhere?  Why does this government use kids to play these games instead of adults?  How have the people not revolted against the government taking their children to fit to the death?  There are just too many questions left unanswered.<br /><br />To sum it up, This film lacks connection with characters and many explanations to many different subjects.  However this wouldn't stop me from watching the sequel, but I'm not going to be standing in line to watch it in theaters either. I can easily wait for it to come out on home video.  This also doesn't mean I regret watching this film, but it is simply average.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Ever since I started reading these books I've loved them! If you like good fiction b<br />ooks, then try it out. Percy Jackson is entertaining, and in my opinion, you don't have to be a kid to enjoy them.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's quite refreshing to find a game of this level.  Very pleased with the product and will admit that I am slightly addicted.  Excellent job.

B004NOH9LC|5.0|Gives you that &#34;feel good&#34; feeling after watching!!! Harrison Ford did his expected great acting. Has  potential of being a classic! Going to purchase!!
B00457WZEI|5.0|It was great. I love this book and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a great horse book. I love the way people go out of their way to get the same horse.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|Great movie about a greater than life general.  I love the movie because it was produced with a goal of accuracy about a WWII hero.  George C. Scott was brilliant as Patton.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was an amazing book! Every detail painted a picture in my mind, brilliantly written! I'm definitely reading the rest of the books in the series!
0307720950|4.0|I was glad to read a pretty good book on the coming maker revolution.  It was a little less technical than I would have liked, but this quality may appeal to some.
0062215507|5.0|My 8 yr old loved this book. He loves everything Harry Potter, and there is amazing detail in this book, and lots of extras to look at. A definite must for HP fans.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|this a great album of theirs. it is a bit different from the older ones but i like it. it is new and innovative.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've wanted to read this since I was a kid but never got around to it. With the movie coming out I thought I better do it now. So glad I did.
B007XGJK4G|4.0|This documentary gives a good historical perspective on Bob Marley and the evolution of Reggae.<br />It clears up many false perceptions on Bob and the Rastafarian Religion

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Absolutely loved the whole CD. It was as I expected. Did not let me down musicly. It shipped in great conditionl
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It would be nice to select this App as your screensaver on Kindle Fire models.  Having the clock display the correct time and day would be great.  Also, need to add &#34;date&#34; to the display option, whether as a screensaver option or just another enhancement to the App.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a fascinating--if claustrophobic--look at one way of dealing with contentious humanity in the post-human age: lock 'em up in silos and lie to them. A lot.<br /><br />Hugh Howey has touched on some deep elements of human psychology here, and it's icing on the cake that he's created interesting, fully realized and fully-human characters. This is a must-read for fans of post-apocalyptic fiction, and of science fiction in general.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Talk about convenience, I'm able to see/use not only my e-mail InBox, but have My Contacts and My Calendar available, too!  I'm very happy with this App as it gives me access to Yahoo! on a device other than my PC and iPhone.  Utilizing my Kindle as a tablet to access the web is another plus I wasn't really expecting;  I thought I'd only use my Kindle Fire for e-books.  What a great surprise!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Thought it was a great movie. Exellent performance by Daniel Day Lewis. I thought it should have went a bit more into the assination and Booth man hunt, still a great film.
B008I43DYU|4.0|I found this app to be very useful and convenient.  Large font and display make this calculator easy to see and touch.  Only suggestion I have is to include convenience of &#34;decimal point&#34; selection.  This would help with certain mathematical problems.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was a welcome surprise. Great graphics. Challenging puzzles. A bit short for my liking, but enjoyed it immensely. Eagerly awaiting to step into the next Room.
B001CDF05O|4.0|This was a great concert, similar to the release &#34; One more car, one more rider&#34; 2 disc cd. With today's technology,I wish it could have been recorded in a stereo version rather than mono.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Another great movie from Peter Jackson! I have been a Tolkien fan since I was a child and watching his work brought to life on the screen is a dream come true! Can't wait for the next installment :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it. It will even read the scriptures to you. It has different Bibles. I would recommend it to anybody.
B00BFIFIPS|2.0|Beware:  This case is large and will not fit most lightning adaptors except for the cable.  Very disappointed in the case and it's unnecessary size.  Lime green is actually more of a yellow.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Was delighted to find this item for such a good price and it came very quickly in the mail (which was a good thing, since I was dead in the water on my project).
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This fits perfect into my kindle fire and charger for kindle device.  I believe another device that is a must buy if you buy the amazon kindle power fast charging device..
0061537969|5.0|you will laff, cry, and not want to put it down, its not what you thought it was about,,a great read
B000P0J09W|5.0|DVD came brand new and works great. I loved this movie growing up and now my kids can too. A+
B00005K3O4|5.0|It's impossible to defend this movie on the grounds of aesthetic value.  I won't even try.  This is a film that will either surprise and delight you, or it will confuse and dismay your sensibilities.  I fall into the category of those who can appreciate its bizarre humor.  I find this film captivatingly stupid; it's an impossible thrill ride of pure nonsense.  Where else could you find a film involving Killer Klowns who gleefully dispatch their victims with cute ray-guns firing cotton candy?  They also have some pretty nasty popcorn in their arsenal.  This film is the result of a perfect convergence of ineptitude and chance.  The cast is uniformly awful (with the exception of the purposeful John Vernon who arguably has the best of the worst lines in this film).  Most of the actors play their characters with a manic intensity that borders on lunacy.  The real stars, of course, are the never ending number of clowns.  The fact that they were able to imbue these (mostly) silent creations with individual personalities is remarkable.  This is a fun and very insane film, I consider myself lucky to have stumbled upon it in the first place.  I've watched and enjoyed it many times and will continue to do so for eons to come.
B000AYELVA|5.0|I'm a big fan of the X-Men, the movie is fun and I loved it. I bought this years ago, but some kids broke into my apartment and made off with all my DVDs. I have been unable to find the 1st one in stores, only the 2nd & 3rd.
B000O14VAU|4.0|Great entertainment. Action packed modern twist on vampire and werewolf competition. Almost totally believable, just suspend your powers of disbelief.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This was an awesome book. It was so good I couldn't  stop reading until I feel asleep holding it. Waiting for day two!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Truly smooth game play and well crafted puzzles. I found a few moments really challenging though each time it was just because I was forgetting to use the eye piece.<br /><br />What I liked most was how the puzzles were solved. This game isn't about dumb luck or just tapping randomly.  You have to think your way through much of the game and it builds intelligently upon what you've done previously.<br /><br />It also makes great use of the hardware available in the kindle fire hd.  Touch is smoooooth. The tilt and swivel works well.  The graphics are sharp and well crafted.<br /><br />My only criticism is that I don't want to wait for the next episode. It was that much fun.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Must admit Paramore can do no wrong in my eyes, been a huge fan since the beginning and this album might be there best and I listened to Brand New Eyes alot. Has a different feel than what I was expecting but I love it, all the songs have really grown on me
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's such a beautiful game to look at to solve puzzles. It really makes you think and pause and remember things. It was just shorter than I was expecting.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|Truth be told, I didn't read the book until last year. To date I have seen 6 other \\"Jane Eyre\\" adaptations (4 movies & 2 miniseries).<br /><br />This adaptations screen writer is Sandy Welsh, who has written 2 of my favorite miniseries: \\"North & South\\" '04 (the Elizabeth Gaskell novel)- a 1st place tie between \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" '95, as being my most favorite period drama to date! And (Jane Austen's) \\"Emma\\" '09.<br />So for me, she's set the bar quite high in her productions.<br /><br />Sadly, this miniseries pales in comparison to the faithfulness of the previous two BBC miniseries: 1973 & 1983.<br /><br />While the events are substantially in order, the dialogue is modernized (aka \\"dumbed down\\").<br /><br />The chemistry (or in this case, the overt portrayal of physical attraction) is believable enough, but I guess that's because it's pushed in the viewers face every few minutes. Sadly this is a misinterpretation of the story-- being Rochester & Jane are both described in less attractive terms; so their mutual attraction lies in their personality & intellectual connection.<br /><br />I felt this \\"Rochester\\" (Toby Stephens) lacked the complexity of the books character. His \\"brooding\\" lasts about 5-10 minutes, then he turns into a ridiculous lovesick whelp (but to be fair, part of the blame could lie in script, and direction). In the book, \\"Rochester\\" is very careful at concealing his true feelings until the proposal scene; not so with this.<br />Ruth Wilson's portrayal of \\"Jane\\" was a fair bit better (likely in my top 3); although her appearance is much prettier than her book counterpart.<br /><br />The major things I didn't care for are (**SPOILER ALERT**):<br /><br />- Miss Temple was missing from Jane's extremely shortened and glossed over Lowood experience (something the other 2 mini's included); who was very much a guiding force, and savior for Jane!<br />In fact, it was after Miss Temple married and left, that Jane decided to leave herself.<br /><br />- Instead of the game of charades in the book, they replaced it with the Victorian version of Ouija (which I skipped over).<br />The charades scene was important, because one of them happened to depict Rochester & Miss Ingram being married (thus stirring a pang of emotion in Jane).<br /><br />- An actual Gypsy woman was hired by Rochester, instead of him dressing up and pretending to be one. A major cop-out if you ask me, being the other 2 miniseries faithfully portrayed this important scene.<br />It's Rochester's rather unconventional (and somewhat comical) attempt at ascertaining her inner feelings towards him.<br /><br />- Rochester's plea for Jane to stay after the Bertha revelation, was seriously altered from the book, and sadly cheapened by spicing it up.<br />That whole bed scene simply did not happen in the book; at this point Jane shunned Rochester's displays of affection!<br />Again, refer to the '73 & '83 adaptations, if you want an accurate depiction!<br />(I also think the 2011 movie captured this crucial scene much better, despite it being shortened.)<br /><br />- The glimpse of Bertha's licentious behavior after her marrying Rochester was utterly gratuitous, again, another ridiculous attempt at spicing the story up; a simple verbal explanation would have sufficed!<br /><br />In conclusion, I feel this miniseries had the potential to be so much better than it was. If you really desire an accurate depiction, look elsewhere ('73 or '83 miniseries, or the condensed 2011 movie).<br />On the other hand, if you don't mind a modernized soaped up version of \\"Jane Eyre\\", then look no further!ead of the game of charades in the book, they replaced it with the Victorian version of Ouija (which I skipped over).<br />The charades scene was important, because one of them happened to depict Rochester & Miss Ingram being married (thus stirring a pang of emotion in Jane).<br /><br />- An actual Gypsy woman was hired by Rochester, instead of him dressing up and pretending to be one.

1433502410|5.0|The best bible that I have ever read!! Excellent source for those who want a deep understanding of the word. The bible has tons of maps, illustrations, and tables to help explain who, what, when and where in the bible. Makes it plain.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game was awesome to me .  I liked the monkey that would follow you if you stumbled.  I like diamonds to
1439152802|5.0|This was a wonderful book. I enjoyed the many puzzles and surprises. Very well-written and..it made me cry. This is far better than her last novel, and it will be on my list of favorite books of all time. Very good all around. Thank you, Kate Morton.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room is an amazing mind bending game, in some spots it is a little challenging but is all worth it. I highly recommend the Room. It's a little shorter than I expected but it was worth the 1.99 . Get. For other Kindle Fire viewers out there this game worked fine for me so that won't be a problem. Again this game was awesome. And unlike other games this one has hints. And if you mess up or get stuck you can restart your game.
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|Many good songs on this CD.  I would recommend this to others.  Most of the songs have been out on the radio already.
B009EJSUBY|5.0|This is an outstanding collection for anyone who loves piano classics.  The movie DVD about Van Cilburn's live is also superb.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|We saw the play on Broadway, and we saw this movie at the theater.  I have seen many version of this and this is by far one of the best ever done.  For anyone that is a Les miserables fan you have to get this movie.
B00BZODDYU|4.0|Before I purchased this movie, I read a number of critic reviews and found them to be extremely mixed. Many critics liked the film; many disliked it. All called it derivative.<br /><br />I can't say I agree. I really enjoyed this little creeper of a film! It may not be the best horror film in the whole wild world, but it certainly scared the crap out of me and my girlfriend. That's not bad for a PG-13 movie!<br /><br />The story goes that a father goes on a murderous rampage, then kills his estranged wife and naps his two daughters. He drives off at crazy speeds and spins off the road. Surviving the accident, he wanders with his daughters through a cold, isolated woods until he discovers a seemingly unused cabin.<br /><br />Flash forward five years. The kids' uncle has been looking for them all these years, and his investigators find them still living in the cabin; daddy is nowhere to be found. How the heck did those two little feral girls survive all that time on their own?<br /><br />Or WERE they on their own?<br /><br />This movie wasn't exactly subtle. It wasn't as if I couldn't foresee many of the plot twists, but it still scared the snot out of me. No tiny feat that! It reminds me of that other little horror gem [[ASIN:B001E907IG Darkness Falls]]. Not a big movie. Not a perfect movie. But a damned good movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flawed but thrilling film!
B009POCG2C|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie. If anyone loves baseball you are going to love this movie. And Clint Eastwood is great in it.
B00CAJP0ZO|1.0|I am so sick of autotune and this guy must have stock in the company that made the software. I bet Dancing With The Stars wishes they never let him on the show. I would rate this album 0 stars if I could.

B005K17RU0|4.0|It has lots of information and easy to use.  It is very handy and convenient.  Comes in handy when traveling.
B00683JLXA|3.0|Just check my profile pic. But this app ain't all that great. The graphics are rudimentary. The game is only marginally interesting. Physics is mediocre. But it's an ok time waster, I guess. But the cutest bears in all the world deserve something a bit better. Still, I gotta support my fave bears. So download it, will ya. And maybe even go adopt a real panda like we did. Support a little cuteness in this cruel world.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Absolutely LOVE Michael Buble and anything he sings, he puts his own touch to it and just makes me swoon to hear him.
B00742GBDM|3.0|Well acted, adequately costumed, excellent settings (hence the 3 stars) ... but the characters do not feel real.  At times they voice surprisingly modern opinions and feelings, and I found this to be a disconcertingly jarring note that spoiled the total effect for me.  Not real Jane Austen, definitely.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Blakes music never disappoints. Every song is worth listening to. I love the duets. And the price was reasonable also.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Kitschy fun and definitely quirky!  With sci-fi, comedy, drama and romance how could you go wrong.  Waaaay better than new stuff on TV ;-)
B00AKEMHCA|2.0|my son liked the game but i had to remove it after he somehow managed to spend actuall money buying things in the game? this scares me. i may not buy him anymore games as i didnt realize this could be done
B004HO6I4M|5.0|very nice family movie . a lot of singing and dancing and good for all ages. adults and children will enjoy
B009WO7NQO|3.0|my son says it is ok, he plays it sometimes, not as often as a few others he has (wheres my water, airplanes, etc)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|ILove this game so cool I cant stop playing the game. I love love love love love love love it that's how good it is

B00A8ECU24|1.0|Really disappointed. I logon today to find out all the work this week is gone. I had won Babs Seed and now she's gone. Not to mention the progress I made on leveling and collecting money. Now I have to either spend money or grind out another week to make up for it.  I used to love this game and now it's frustrating and all they care about is money.
B008602KQI|5.0|It is the first book I read in English. I found it easy to read, and most of all to story captivated me from the beginning!
B0044IJ1S6|5.0|It is awesome to see a band like Depeche Mode deliver such a great performance each and every single song. Great visuals on the blu ray, a great experience for 80's-90's music fans and a must have for every Depeche Mode fan.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|It was enlightening to hear the progression through the eyes of the patient.  And, we found it true that there was no support for the patient - only the caregivers... even now in different areas there is none.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Finally a romance ha doesn't glorify fornication. I enjoyed this book scanned past he x rated material.  Some of it made no sense like she put her peep heeled toe in his belt.  WAS it the heel or toe. Got any books for the geriatric set.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Finished the book and the ending was not as expected.  The story switched back and forth too much to sometimes follow easily.
B000069KGM|5.0|This is one great classic rock album by The Chicago Transit Authority, they later changed their name to just Chicago. This includes their first big hit, \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\", plus the classic hits \\"Beginnings\\", \\"Questions 67 & 68\\", & \\"I'm a Man\\". All the other songs are great, and fit in very nicely. The \\"Introduction\\" is very good. I saw this band, and this exact line-up perform live, back in the very early 1970's. This is a great classic rock album/cd that will fit well into any Rock Collection. Thanks!!!!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It does not offer any kind of real challenge. I found it to be somewhat boring. It needs a little more action.
B000JCQCW4|1.0|Hated it. Hated it. Hated it.Hated it. Hated it. Hated it. It's just made up stuff to get a strong emotional response.  I get it additction is bad.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|i enjoyed the first and second book of the series, the third book was okay-seemed liked author tried to put to much in to bring it to an end
0763621803|5.0|It is amazing to see how children respond to the fantasy of a book . In our case, our 2-year-old daughter enjoyed eating peas the very next day
B002ODRPUE|5.0|I've seen it several times, first time in a theater, when it was first playing.  Should have a rating of M for mature. Want to point out that there was a great story there. If it were produced today the storyline would have an entirely different effect on the audience.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|I viewed this movie in the past and could not remember some of the details so I wanted a copy for my library.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This series is a wonderfully-done adaptation of the biography.  It brings more than 50 years of U.S. history to life, showing the flawed humanity of many of our major historical figures.  We sometimes take our history for granted, but this series leads the viewer to think about how so many of our major events could easily have turned out differently.  So many times along the way, our country almost didn't come to be.<br /><br />My husband and I relished each episode so much that I am now using the series for part of the history requirements for alternative education high school students.  I created a short study guide with questions and research for the students to complete with each episode.  The students find this series much more engaging and memorable than their history textbook.  They are thinking and writing more.  They want to know what happened next.  The extra features included in the DVDs are a bonus.  These include the option to show on-screen facts (kind of like subtitles) that help students understand the historical significance of a particular scene, plus a documentary interviewing the author of the biography, and a feature telling more about how the series was made.<br /><br />This is just a fabulous series, worthy of six stars if such were possible.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|icons displayed are not explained....retrieving pictures  or importing pictures to my  profile...not happening...but it is all guess work!<br />it would be helpful if there was  some explanation for the icons...ie. click on them, and the explanation appears.  At some point it asked me to position and place my picture, and how?  no arrows ...very frustrating.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|Agatha Christie puts together a wonderful thought-provoking book.  As she leads you through a maze of lies and red-herrings, you barely have time to stop and look back.  There was an amazing solution that I don't think anyone could ever guess. The best bit is the constant stream of interviews that are full of facts and alibis. This really makes you puzzle it out and keeps you on the edge of your seats
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Wow I think it is cute and nice not to easy but not to hard and anyone may like or love it kids and adults try it think is it good or not ?
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game...the best bingo app I have found. Love the ease of using it on facebook on my kindle or my cell phone. Just wish more opportunities were available for earning credits for play.
B001I45UFC|5.0|CS Lewis, a world famous author, has managed to capture my interest with his 'first' book of the Chronicles often Narnia. I know it is the second, but I also know he didn't write the official first book until he had finished the other six. After watching the movie I was thrilled to see a better story in the book. For example, in the movie Peter acting either out fear or concern about killing nearly got his sister killed when she was attacked by the wolf. In the book he went right in slashing and stabbing and saved her by killing the wolf.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|I love Downton Abbey but the Season 3 was not as good as the previous two seasons.  I was also very disappointed in the loss of a major character in the last episode who supposedly was killed in a motoring accident but in reality the actor wanted out of the series.  My favorite among the cast is the wonderful Maggie Smith who elevates the quality of any production.  This is a high-class British soap opera with millions of fans.  IMO, the writers need to introduce some new characters and rethink the story line for Season 4 bringing it back up to the standards of the first two seasons.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I love the movie as I did the books.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Twilight Series.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|The main character is humorous and well drawn out. Supporting cast of characters are fun and unusual. The story line is fascinating and drew me in from the beginning to the very end. No slow moments in this book!
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|I guess the book is not a quick mover. It just felt like it could have used a more ruthless hand in the edit.<br />Also not completely sold on some of the special effects integration. It felt like a theme park ride at some points with the contrast between real footage and computer being glaringly obviouse<br /><br />Still an enjoyable watch however
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing! You should really get it. You can buy different horses. You can compete in compotitions. I recommend it.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I've  seen  simon in  the gaurdian,  I  prefer  the mentalist.  the biggest  differance  is  patricks'  smile.  when  he  was  nick  he  was so sad  all the time.  the mentalist  makes you  want to  watch  more  and more.  when I  watched  it  I  didn't  do  anything  else.  I  always  feel  better after  an episode.  the  white hat cowboy  rides  of  into  the  sunset.......both shows  do  good,  patrick  likes it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Now this is the kind of game l like. Puzzles to solve, places to investigate and HOS as well. And, it last more than 5 minutes. I hope G5 will come out with more of this kind of game.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Unlike some here...I like the app.  Whenever I wake my Kindle Fire, the app is there with the overall state of the battery using a numbered percent and a graphical &quot;3D-ish&quot; display, too.  I am pretty sure I have never turned off my Kindle Fire, but it does sleep a lot.  I recharged it to full 2 days ago and when I woke it a few minutes ago, it was still at 96%.  I am not as &quot;techie &quot; as I once was (though my in-laws think I can fix anything on their computer over the phone even tho they cant remember what they clicked on) I don't believe this app is the energy hog some say it is.
B0098460O4|4.0|Jonathan & Charlotte - both have exceptional singing voices and the songs they sing are lovely. The CD's quality was not very good. Needed better clarity and sound. At times, Jonathan's voice sounded muffled due to the CD's poor quality?
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is so great! This book was so funny that I am thinking of getting the audio version to listen to with my husband on an upcoming road trip. The only thing that might be better is if Tina and Amy write a book together next time!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|They are all back, the characters you love and hate. But what a surprise at the end. What will happen next? Will anyone end up with who they desire? Can't wait for the next book.

B0002S94BG|5.0|Every song is amazing. I can play this over and over again. When I just want to relax I just throw this on. Gone too soon.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Very true to life for much of the work. Could use the gentle touch of a good editor in one or two places. I recommend it as an entertaining read particularly for anyone int the IT industry.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I been looking for a good card game and was about to give up till I ran into this game order &amp; chaos duels and finally found one I love this card game.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Very good movie with talented actors. Music score very good. Fun for kids. Would have no problem with showing it to my grandnephew.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I love it! My husband can't see our bedroom clock, so I set this one at night for him and he can see it no matter how dark is our room. The light is not overwhealmingly bright so it doesn't bother when we sleep.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|Cinema Paradiso<br />  The story line-direction and castting -all were without flaw! A total joy to watch.<br />  I highly recommed to anyone.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|You have to love the classic Disney movies. This is not full screen, they kept the regular 4:3 format; which I like. But they also give you way to view the movie with changing borders on the side of the movie.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I really loved this movie.  Not only the stars but the role that each and every one played.  I felt as if I were going through the entire devastating moment of it.  I felt every knock, bump, wave, and pain that they were going through.  It is really a very moving film.
B0013ND30W|5.0|This is close to a masterpiece. It is widescreen, so it fills in the whole screen. The colors are vibrant and sound is superb.
B005LAIIJY|2.0|I did not like it at all.  I was very disappointed in Jamie Foxx in a silly movie like this!
B00B19DMUE|5.0|OMG I just finished watching this from Amazon rental freaking awesome way scarrier than expected, two outstanding actors give top not performances ( Jeffrey Dean Morgan-John Winchester father of Dean, and Sam winchester on the TV show Supernatural ) plays the dad ( Kira Sedgewick-of The Closer ) plays the mom. After a divorce the dad gets his own house while driving past some houses his youngest daughter ( Emily ) spots a garage sale his daughter reminds him that he needs dishes, they stop and while looking at things ( Emily ) see's an old wooden box with words carved into it. Later on strange things begin happening. After a visit to a professor for a translation then a rabi they learn that the box is actually a prison/vessel to keep a powerful and ancient female demon locked inside, in Jewish language she is named taker of children, a young rabi performs an exorcism and all hell breaks loose<br /><br />The movie is a mix of drama family love and horror it feels very realistic, the actors give excellent performances and play their parts very convincingly. The plot, and scenes are amazing very well done and the overall quality is great definately 5 stars. You can tell that the writers and directors took their time with and put a lot into it
B0061PEAUY|5.0|,Another novel from Kathy Reich's.  This story races along and carries you with it!  Can never put her books down once I start and  the author never disappoints!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app, it lets you download any video from YouTube! Kindle Fire users: to get to the menu, pull that tab on the bottom of the screen to get the bar with the home icon on it. Press the box with the 3 lines in it. Enjoy :)
B007HACDLK|5.0|Typical Flynn fasion, gets off to a fast start and keeps building all the way to the climax. The return of previous characters is always a nice tie in. We need an army of Rapps to get this world back in order.
B00008J2PG|5.0|an amazing story of WW2 bravery as seen thru the eyes of a humble priest.  the filming around italy is gorgeous.  the cast of Sir Gregory Peck, Christopher Plummer as the SS commandant, remarkably accurate and based on a true story!  simply a marvellous story to be told.  surprise stars include fabiana udenio - later becomes a lotta vagina in the mike myers movies!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is very fun, i suggest if u like adventures you get it !!! :)<br />Some levels are tricky but they make you think!
B004UQPM4E|3.0|I guess it's OK because the content is the same, but I was a little embarrassed to give someone a version where the outside is in Spanish.  It kinda looks like I bought it out of the trunk of some shady guy's car just to save a few bucks.  I would not recommend anyone purchase this as a gift.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I bought this app, thinking it would be fun but really, it just makes u buy stuff to do &#34;funner&#34; things with Tom...
B0033RT7RY|4.0|I gave this film four stars because I thought both main characters were plaid well. I have seen this movies a few times and each time I find some little detail I did not catch before. this young woman begins to have the symptoms of the torture and crucifixion of Jesus she feels the pain and she bleeds.Throughout her experience the is a Priest by her side. He was sent from the Vatican to investigate the phenomenon. He is a scientist who became a priest, he has his own demons to deal with about the conflict of science and religion. I will watch it again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. You can play for hours, offline or online. I notice a lot that the sore losers likes to forfeit once you finally win a game. It's ok though, because I am the master, sho-nuf! It would be nice if you could send your opponents a message during game play.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|The movie was inspired by the book written by Col Hal Moore, about his experience leading his men into battle. I am a Vietnam Veteran, and I can say that this movie told it like it was. The battle in the Ia Drang Valley was the first major battle between the  U.S. ARMY and The north Vietnamese Army. Col Moore had a deep affection for his men, and the story is a tribute to the heroism of his men.
0812983459|2.0|Sorry to all the people who loved this book but I found it mostly boring.  In fact, it wouldn't have passed my 100-page rule.  I would have stopped reading it at that point except that this was for book club so I wanted to finish.  The only characters I enjoyed were Rex, the secondary next door neighbor, and Martina, one of the people Harold met along the way who was in a couple of chapters only.  Harold was simply ridiculous and frustrating and sad.  I recognize that he had issues and some mental illness but the \\"adventure\\" never grabbed me.  Yes, it was sweet that his journey resulted in the reevaluation of his and Maureen's relationship and changes in their attitudes. And, yes, there were the big mysteries of what happened to David and how Harold betrayed Queenie. But, by the time the stories were finally told and after reading about all the impracticalities of his purchases and belongings and people along the way, I felt the effort to get there wasn't worth it to me as a reader.  The effort was worth it for the main characters but it just dragged on.  This was one of those books that made me cheer when I was finally done with it so I can move on to read something else.
B0020M99LC|2.0|The parkour in the beginning is fabulous.  Outside of that...boring.  Bond used to have a sense of humor.  Given the ridiculousness of the plots, humor should be a prerequisite.
0765325950|5.0|I  loved the suspense, action, twists and most of all the subtle humor!  It has so many story lines going, I had trouble putting the books down most of the time. And their idea of foul language is hysterical - nothing like what you would expect, but it is set in a mythical time similar to Lord of the Rings.  With of course the battles between good and evil and many petty ones too.
0446547573|3.0|gave it away as a gift, I had read it before. I really enjoy Nicholas Sparks books. Comfortable book to be entertained with.
B0041G683W|5.0|I saw the recent movie, so I had to buy this to see what the anniversary performance was like.  It's nothing short of amazing and stunning, transfixing and beautiful.  I really love it.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|Fantastic product. Strong GPU and strong CPU. In one. For office use I would never pass this. Especially when you consider that you can have new office or home PC with great performance for around 300 dollars.
B00881PTRC|5.0|fun and easy to play....even entertaining to lose....takes the old hangman game to a new level ...the animation is great
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is so fun!!! There are new features that make it more exciting!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you liked the first one you will love this one.
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|The title of the album pretty clearly gives away the meaning of this album to \\"Save Rock N Roll\\" in a society that is so concentrated on synthesized and electronic music, this albums gives a good combination of the traditional instrumental with the new fad of what I'm going to call remixing. Although there is tonalities to the electronic the sound is, at the core, a rock album.<br />As a fan of the older Fall Out Boy music, I must admit I was skeptical about this new album after time away, and I was afraid they would loose what, at the core, I felt was Fall Out Boy. I am happy to say that I was wrong. Each song on the album has a sound that is different from their original stuff, but at the same time sounds like Fall Out Boy should. The album is catchy, up beat, and the song will get stuck in your head. The music itself has, dare I say, matured from the agnsty emo music of the younger days of the band, and has almost an R&B feel with Patrick's voice but the rock feel with the music and the band. But now on to each of the songs themselves.<br /><br />The Phoenix: I fell in love with this song the first time I heard it when they released the music video. It is clearly a \\"single\\", catch in an almost epic manner. The juxtaposition of the loud rock parts that are in your face and the calmer that are more understated parts just make the song work.<br /><br />My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em' Up): The other \\"single\\" on the record, as made evident by the single status. It is by far one of the catchiest songs on the album, with a hook that draws you in, then makes you want to start thrashing around like a wild child. The strong beat just begs for listener to sing along with.<br /><br />Alone Together: This song is more like the \\"Old\\" Fall Out Boy than the first two songs on the album. It feels like an anthem song with the cheering in the back ground and the \\"oh-oh-oh-ing\\" and the lyrics that really doesn't make much sense \\"My heart is like a stallion they love it more when it's broken\\". But then again, when has lyrics in any music made sense when taken out of context? However, when I listened to the album the first time, this song was the song I liked the most at first because of how simple it is.<br /><br />Where Did the Party Go?: Another song that sounds more like the \\"Old\\" Fall Out Boy, at first, but as it progresses has more a mature vibe. There is a clear beat constantly thought the song, and Patrick's voice has the opportunity to show off his range going from higher pitched, to a lower pitch within seconds of each other.<br /><br />Just One Yesterday: This song features the female singer Foxes. The song is slower than the other ones thus far on the record. It relies mostly on the vocals and the harmonizing between Foxes and Patrick is something that the first time I head made me fall in love with the song. To be honest, the first half of the album I could not deny was great and worthy of my money the first time listening to. The same could not be said about the second half.<br /><br />The Mighty Fall: This song features Big Sean. And I must say, it took me about five or six times listening to the song before it started to grow on me. My first though on the song was \\"Big Sean? Really? What are you guys thinking?\\" It's not a rock song, at all. I actually have a hard time categorizing where exactly this song falls in the music radar. In the middle there is a rap, with the beats of what could be a rock song, with hip-hop undertones at one point. It's hard to categorize it. It took me a while to like it because of all the confusion on what exactly it is, but it is certainly unique.<br /><br />Miss Missing You: Now that we've walked away from Big Sean you get Miss Missing You which right off the back sounds like we took a train back to the 1980's and picked up a synthesizer and started playing it next to Wham! And that tone is throughout the entire song. It's a drastic change from the previous song, and confused me even more the first time listening to it because of how it goes from a hip-hop/rock/rap to the 1980's pop. Not bad, defiantly diverse and unexpected, and shows just how different the band is.<br /><br />Death Valley: Now we get back to the \\"Rock N Roll\\" part of the album after take a side trip to Big Sean's house and the 1980's. It's not a bad song, but, in my opinion, one of the more forgettable ones on the album. Not forgettable as in \\"I can't remember the lyrics\\" but more in the aspect of \\"I forgot this one was on here even though I listened to the albums a million times because there are defiantly better songs on here that I love\\". If you get what I mean.<br /><br />Young Volcanoes: There is no question as to why Fall Out Boy decided to make this the third music video in their epic story that involves chopping off Patrick's hand and dancing around a table drugged up with naked women. It is one of the most catchy songs on the album that is bound to get stuck in your head, so beware. The raw sound of the acoustics brings the song fully around and gives it a fun vibe, with the unscripted laughing inserted it's a song about being young and living life to the fullest while you can.<br /><br />Rat A Tat: *Before reading the review for this song please beware of my extreme bias of dislike, I ask you go into each song with an open mind and I will try to be fair to the music despite this being my least favorite song on the album* To begin with Courtney Love. Actually, that's all I can really say, this feature on the album really made me cringe when the first words were \\"It's Courtney B****\\" It feels out of place in the song, and the song is rather repetitive. And I think it best to leave it at that before I begin ranting.<br /><br />Save Rock and Roll: This song features Elton John. At first, you think Elton John is playing the piano and not singing, like John Meyer playing their cover of Beat It, but then he starts singing. I will admit the first time I heard it, much likeall the people I shared the song with, I was really freaked out when hearing Elton John singing about halfway onto the song. It's not something that I was expecting, but after the initial shock of  Elton John (go figure) the song began to grow on me, to the point where I feel like I'm rocking out with Elton John going \\"You go Elton John you save rock and roll!\\" It's not what you would expect from fall Out Boy and the only song of theirs that this is even slightly comparable to is \\"What a Catch Donnie\\" and that is simply because it's a slower tempo with a piano accompaniment. After that, this is, in my opinion, like no other Fall Out Boy song, and is worthy of finishing the album off.

B0040QYROK|5.0|The story deals with the titular city Metropolis, a glittering massive paradise--at least, for those priviledged few who live in the upper part. The lower class citizens who live below the surface must toil day and light to keep the city running. Freder, the son of Joh Fredersen, the, uh....I guess he's the mayor of Metropolis...Freder one day discovers the horrible reality of the conditions in which the workers must work. Freder quickly sides with the workers, much to the chargrin of his father, and meets Maria, the beautiful prophetess who gives hope to the workers by preaching the arrival of a mediator who will bring peace to Metropolis. Rotwang, a local inventor, has created a humanoid automaton, and Joh Fredersen tells him to make his Machine-Man look like Maria so the doppelganger can destroy the hopes of the workers once and for all. Rotwang agrees to the order, but secretly has his own agenda to crush Joh Fredersen; apparently they were once rivals for the affections of Hel, Fredersen's wife and Freder's mother. Freder discovers the android double and races to prevent the destruction of Metropolis.<br /><br />Since it was made in 1927, it is a silent movie and therefore uses dialogue cards to convey what the characters are saying. The problem is that there is so much talking in the movie and most of the characters' speech does not have accompanying text, so you have to infer what is being said based on the context. Also, much of the plot is merely hinted at, so we can only guess what happened in the past between Joh Fredersen and Rotwang the inventor. This has to do with the fact that parts of the original reel were lost long ago.<br /><br />The visual aspect of the movie is hit-or-miss due to the degraded parts of the original film. Parts of the movie look really good, and other parts are really grainy. Fortunately, the movie is very up-front about this, so you know what you're getting into beforehand. On the plus side, the artwork within the movie has easily stood the test of time. The pictures of Metropolis shown within the movie are highly detailed and fantastic. I'd love to hang them on my wall.<br /><br />The one thing that is excellent all the way through is the music. The original orchestral score has been faithfully recreated and is top-notch. In fact, this is the kind of movie you'd want to buy the soundtrack to.<br /><br />All in all, Metropolis is a little confusing, very weird and pretty awesome.ly stood the test of time.

B0013D8LCW|4.0|This movie is about a young man called Zach. He is an artist trying to make ends meet. His sister (Jeannie) is irresponsible so he takes good care of her son Cody and he thinks of him as his dad. Zach is in a relationship with his friend Tori, but he falls in love with Gabe's brother (Gabe is his best friend who lives in the rich part of their town). They start to see each other secretly until Zach takes Cody to Shaun's place and Jeannie finds out through Cody one day. Then Zach is forced to talk about it. I love the quality of the film and all the actors/actresses did an amazing job. I also love the story. The only thing I don't like about this film is that Gabe and Jeannie smoked around Cody. Zach shouldn't have told Cody to go and start his car 'cause it's dangerous. Last but not least, Jeannie should've chosen someone who also loved Cody. But ultimately, it's a very wonderful film. I laugh when I watch some scenes and Zach &amp; Shaun have amazing chemistry. It's so nice to see them together. I recommend it.
B00683JLXA|5.0|Ok, this is not a 5 Star game by any means, but, come on, it's pretty good.<br />It's an above average Angry Birds rip off.  It's 3 1/2 Stars in my opinion.<br />I'm giving it 5 because so my people are under-rating it for no real reason.<br />Enjoy, it's the Free Game of the Day.

B000HWZ4A2|1.0|\\"Even for those who don't adhere to her philosophy, The Fountainhead does offer something rarely seen on screens these days, a man of unshakable principles.\\"<br /><br />Does this Liebenson fellow watch movies? Every other movie that comes out features \\"a man of unshakable principles\\". It's one of the staples of cinema and, often, the story wholly relies on such men (or women) to move the story forward. I seriously don't know how someone writing a film description for a Warner Bros. DVD being sold on amazon could be so profoundly ill-informed.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|If you're a new or old time Eagles fan this box set is great. You get most of the groups output for the price of about two new CDs. It comes in a nice sleek black box and envelope sleeves (with original front and back covers) of each album, ideal for travel. I'm not sure, but I believe the albums are remastered, since the box sets seems to demonstrate a higher and more pleasing sound quality than the 1999 remasters. In other words, if you already have these albums, you won't be disappointed. Experience one of America's greatest band from the 1970s in in all it's beauty and lush. A collectors item and audio treasure, no doubt.
1432794426|5.0|Defending a King is a very appropiate titel for this book. It is clearly written by someone who really comprehends the force, love and nature of Michael Jackson. The many people who add something to this book gives you a vivid impression of MJ. Often you smile in understanding the ways and actions of MJ and at times your heart breaks in the clear picture of a worldloving man who is, or I sadly have to say, was a prisoner in his own world. The entire book takes us on a rollercoaster emotionel tour, giving facts in a way that makes us feel we're there. KM gave us a book that reveals she has seen the true understanding of who and what Michael was, is and allways will be - a multitalented performer full of heart who CARED. Sadly he is no more - gladly we have someone like KM to be here to tell about him.
B00AZ2LS5O|1.0|something wrong with the blu ray disc....i opened and when i tried to play the disc i spent looooong time and has failure and doesn't work !!!!!<br />i need my money back or a replacement of this product A.S.A.P!
076421120X|4.0|This is a beautiful devotional by the worship leader for Hillsong and writer of \\"Shout to the Lord!\\"  Inspired by her own journal entries, she focuses on a wide variety of topics.  This hardcover devotional covers a whole year, with a Bible verse, the devotion, and a brief prayer on each page.<br /><br />I liked the fact that each devotion was short and wouldn't take long at all to read.  It's also handy that the Bible verse is written out.  Though the thoughts aren't unique, they are encouraging and truth-filled.  This is a gorgeous book and would make a great gift.<br /><br />I received this book free from Bethany House Publishers in exchange for an honest review.
1451624468|5.0|My youngest son game me a reference to this author...and yes really nice information presented in a very simple way for anyone, almost, to get a clue regarding.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is like a murder mystery, for me anyway...<br /><br />It was like reading an IT version of a CSI book.
0613181468|5.0|Very interesting litterature...In my university days this type of books very hard to get to sweden hence the books very unike and you often got one from a collecue and if you were lycky you could buy book if you visitid Stanford as an example....now you are only a couple of clicks and a short time vaiting before you have the books in your hand.<br />Good buy.
0553378384|4.0|I think this is an amazing book that identifies things that may affect us in this life that belong to our past lives.  It's organized so you can go right to the section that is right for you based on your birthday.  Oh, such good opportunities to 'let go' of behaviors/beliefs that don't serve me in this life.

B007UQRW62|5.0|Great movie musical of a long-gone Hollywood era.  Era is gone, but this movie is timeless.  Extra material is extensive and fun.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a great game to pass your time away. It has enough going on to hold your interest. It's better than a lot of the matching games I've found. Only thing wrong, is the timer runs down to quickly for me.
0061478784|5.0|Great, charming & beautiful history.  I really love the Giblin movie, its my favorite. I decide to read the book, is different from the movie &#34; I was kind of worry when notice it&#34; but reading the book was a surprise. I enjoy it a lot to see the different &#34; matises&#34; of the characters, the interaction between then, the description of the castle & the places, I felt in love again.<br />The book like the movie give a feeling of peace.<br /><br />I recommend these book to kids & adults
B00CHVJODE|5.0|This movie was some of the most fun i've had with a movie in a long time. It was hilarious, emotionally deep and original on every turn. The moral and underlining tone is as relevant as ever. Going against everything you know in order to survive and actually live your life is something we all must come to terms with and this movie hits the nail on the head. The graphics are incredible, the soundtrack is heart racing and dialogue is fluidly natural.<br /><br />From the previews I did not expect it to be this good but I was pleasantly surprised. This is an absolutely perfect family film. It's hilarious, touching and relevant. Everyone should see this movie.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|This film has a fantastic cast, and tells a compelling story of power, collusion, and man's inhumanity to man.  Since this is based on history, the ending is truly sad.  Still, it is a must see film.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game I play it every day all day until my phone dies.<br />FUUUN FUNN FUNN!!!!!!!<br />My whole family love it and they all downloaded it
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|awesome story. great characters! definitely recommend this book and looking forward to reading her other book soon. that is all
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is a great game I think any one from 4-40 can play it my dad an mom play it and they have a great time
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Replaced the trusty, but aged E8400 Wolfdale with this and am extremely happy.  The 8400 never missed a lick, and probably logged a million hours of gaming.  So far, I have nothing to suggest any lesser performance from this newer workhorse.<br /><br />Runs everything - and I mean EVERYTHING we throw at it, runs it well, and runs it smoothly at stock settings.  Finally went with water cooling, and while the old system ran fine, it did run hot - a couple of times SO hot it started artifact-ing and 'sparkling' under stress until we blew out all the cooler fins and plugged it back in for another year.  This chip runs 24/7, games for a good percentage of that time, and has NEVER exceeded 42c. (Normal idle is mid 30s)  Not a stutter, hiccup or bump since it was installed, powered up and booted the first time.<br /><br />Should the need arise, according my motherboard, it will OC like a big dog (preset on my MB will crank it up to 4.8), LUCID has reduced GPU temps as a bonus, and I'm a happy camper ... oh wait - I hate campers, but you get my drift.<br /><br />It runs Photoshop and Premiere like it's strolling a beach, encodes x264 in several iterations in a tiny fraction of the time I'm used to, and mutlitasks MUCH better than I do.<br /><br />Thought about going to the dark side (AMD), but held fast and very happy I did.  Thought about the 3770, but my research indicated there would be no improvement in gaming, so the extra $ could not be justified.  I'm all about best bang for the buck, and fully believe THIS to be it if you're even a part-time gamer.  If all you do is render video, the move up might make sense, but for me, it did not.<br /><br />I can't think of any way I could be more pleased with the performance (obviously unless it were free), and I'd buy it again without a thought.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|Again I had the DVD version of this movie.  The Blu-ray version of this movie is a clearer picture which enhances the viewing of this movie.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|The album took some getting used to but now we love it.  It plays repeatedly in the 6-CD player in the car.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This movie stretches the facts of history.  For the entertainment value, this movie was very good and worth the price.
B00881VLCE|5.0|My granddaughter was only four when I downloaded this game she's now five. I taught her how to use it and it keeps her busy for hours. She loves the wonderful colors  and the animal puzzles.
B000N0W9WO|5.0|I owned the DVD version of this movie.  The blu-ray version has a cleaner picutre quality.  I enjoyed watching it.
0865478007|5.0|Publication bias is insidiously affecting the validity of things we do in medicine. This book is an excellent introduction to the subject.
B000065V42|4.0|I owned the video tape version of the movie.  The only drawback to this version is that it is a full screen format.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Loved this short book. Hitchens writes about his cancer in an inimitable fashion. I expected nothing less. The last chapter is haunting.
B008IGP8RI|5.0|After watching the movie, which was great, I had to get the CD.  I was pleased with the music on the CD.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a very fun game. I play almost every night. The other games by Game circus are just as fun.
B005USZML4|5.0|John you have done it again. I love your books, fellow readers you won't be disappointed a really great read anytime. Theo is a very cool kid I would want my kids to know and be around.<br />  After reading several other of Grisham's books I am impressed with the kid lawyer because the young adult and parents can read this book to maybe a little younger kids and can be safe of the contents of the book being inappropriate for them.<br />  I can't wait to read the next book, I know it is going to be better than this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't stop watching this show. I love it.  Each episode keeps getting better.  I can't wait for season 4.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I love Mahjong and all of these games are great. Have almost all of them now. Well worth the money.
B009NNG202|3.0|I liked seeing a glimpse of that time period.<br />Some good acting.<br />Story kept moving along, even if I didn't like parts of it.<br />The general theme is a little nasty.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is one of the better games that I have downloaded on my kindle fire. I would recommend it to anyone who likes survival games.
B008UG0IS0|5.0|This is the latest of Hiromi's CDs and as is her standard, it is absolutely awesome. I am a music lover for way over 50 years, have listened to the great pianists of the world. In my opinion, Hiromi is the very best pianist alive today!! Her groups are wonderful as well. How do they do it? AMAZING!!
B0063M22QO|2.0|Boring.
B00683JLXA|1.0|This game stands on it's own. As a bad game. The throwing mechanic is a disaster. I recommend a pass on this one.
0670026603|5.0|Great story line.  I'd never read a book about this subject before.  The book really gave me insights about the life of someone confined to a wheelchair and their caregivers.  Very interesting!
B00881PTRC|5.0|Love it. Me and my kids laugh at the graphics. Playing one player is great since I don't have to create words.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I bought the first two books for my Kindle, since they were free.  I wasn't expecting much, therefore, but I was VERY pleasantly surprised to discover that they were amazing!!  I have bought the rest of the series now and each book is wonderful.  David Weber is a very gifted author and I'd highly recommend this series to anyone into military science fiction.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was recommended to me for my 10-year-old great-nephew. He said a lot of his friends were reading it and thought it was good. We were trying to find a way to keep in touch with each other since we live  a great distance apart, so we thought reading a book together, on our e-readers, would be a good way to do this.<br />I'm 54 years old and I loved the book. I was also very pleasantly surprised and pleased that he and his friends had the compassion to understand what this story is all about...
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really felt like I was there watching everything unfold.  Very well written and keep your mind facing as to what was going to happen next.  I can't wait to watch the movie now.
B005BCE7II|5.0|Watching this on 3D is great, my 15 year old has watched it so many times<br />recommend it for any age
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This was a reassuring read. Anyone who thinks they need to network more, present more, collaborate more, etc. must read this. The author is engaging and appreciates the need for balance.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I just love these series and season 2 didn't disappoint us either.  Can't wait for season 3 to come out
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is pretty sweet. it keeps you thinking and tempts you with the cheat codes. I will keep playing for sure
B00B2V66VS|3.0|After the 1st time I played this it wouldn't work. Now it keeps sending me back to where I was before I opened it. GRRR!
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Absolutely perfect start to finish.  Nothing negative to say.  The music is beautiful, haunting, enchanting, mysterious, powerful, mood elevating.  Favorite songs are Au Revoir, Preacher, and If I Lose Myself.  At 52 I may be older than the targeted demographic but God it's great.  One of the best albums ever purchased, and one that goes on my top ten list.
1400064627|5.0|This book is a good read. I learned a lot from it too. I recommend this book to all of Fannie's fans and mostly any one else.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|It's one of those CDs where you love almost every song in it. The only exception is Twist of barbwire; I don't like the \\"Avery\\" style.<br />If I didn't know better is my favourite since I heard it in the series, that was why I bought this CD.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I was reAlly in to this ...then the March update broke it and now it won't play. I hope you fix this soon gamelofts!!!!
B00683JLXA|2.0|Angry birds already has enough of its own side trails and themes. This isn't new or innovative. Although if you've played and mastered all those games I suppose you like this type of game enough you will be looking for a new challenge.
B008I34ZFW|1.0|Nothing else can be said.  Bad acting and bad plot.  Could have been a good one...but...naw, just a bad film.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|Installs fine on my Samsung Galaxy S 2, but not on my daughter's Nabi 2 -- the most popular and most powerful kid's tablet in the world.<br /><br />What a colossal blunder.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. I have several cities listed so I can see what the weather is where family members live.  It loads a little slowly sometimes, but the info is great.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Great movie; came very well packaged.  I always loved true stories, and this one added to myknowledge of history  That doesn't happen often!.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Best book yet I couldn't put it down time for the last one.. this is a must read book all of them are
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|if your going to call the record, and the song, save rock & roll, better dang well save it. the song is not rock & roll, nor worthy of saving anything. the pheonix should have been titled \\"save rock n roll\\" and it would have made more sense, and worked out better being the first track. i give that one song a half star, and by affect, the album 4 stars because of which. thanks elton john, you ruined what could have been a perfect record :-/
1475143389|5.0|gives you the truth about all you need to know about working out and dieting. Gives you proper form and a great program to follow.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We bought this because some of our crew members are extras on the Homeland series and it's fun seeing everyone playing their background actor roles.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book creates a mood of thoughtfulness in the reader. I cannot say enough about it so I will stop.
B008602KQI|3.0|Well, I loved the plot but the quality of the movie was not great. Overall, it was okay! great characters
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great stories keep me coming back season after season, the NCIS series is one of the best cop shows around!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book will change your life, if you really take it seriously. Since I read it, I am up at 4:00am (normally that would be 11am); I started to run at least twice a week( normally once a month); Spent time studying for classes 1-2hours a day(normally total of 4hours per week); Show at work 15 minutes earlier(normally 5 minutes after).<br />Change is not easy, some days I wonder why I am hard on myself well because I need to do things I don't want in order to get where I want.<br /><br />If you have  been in the military it would be easier to understand and believe in this book. I highly recommend the book to anyone especially to those who need a slight push in life.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Rolling-on-the floor funny with a high geek factor to boot!  Brain candy that doesn't let you turn your brain completely off. Absolutely addicitve.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|This is a great movie, but if you're looking for the overall true history surrounding emancipation, you'll have to buy, or rent the book by McPherson titled \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\".  Emancipation of the slaves actually extended the Civil War by demoralizing the Union Army who was fighting to keep the Union together, not fighting to free the slaves, but the movie centers on Lincoln pushing for emancipation.  Great movie all the same.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|Great stories keep me coming back season after season, the NCIS series is one of the best cop shows around!
B005K17RU0|2.0|I loved the previous app.  It was my go-to weather,but I am not happy with the update.  It has too many unneeded graphics that take too long to load.  I loved the ease of getting the radar on the previous app.  I have actually thought about removing the app,  but am waiting to see if they fix the mess they created first.  Please repair this mess!
B00005JLK1|4.0|A Great Movie... One that t will keep your attention, all the way through the  movie with an ending that makes you go...Hmmm
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|A must see.  It would be great if there was a sequel in the works.  I definitely would want to see.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|My grandson plays games on my kindle fire when he stays the weekend with us.  He loves Bridge Constructor Playground.  He shows us his creations and talks about them when he's not on the kindle.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Miyazaki is a master and this is him at his peak. If you've ever wondered what Moebius would be like had he been born in Japan then look no further this  is your answer.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is by far the BEST book I have ever read. I highly recommend it to anyone. Its the best book ever written by far.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Great read.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  Looking forward to reading more from Me. McKenna.  Thanks for the enjoyment.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|It is hard to beat a Disney story. Loved the characters and songs. The independence of the girl is most admirable
B005IQZB14|2.0|This book really bummed me out, so I stopped reading it right about the time when she started her journey, totally unprepared.
B0060MYM3S|3.0|I loved the first season- it followed the book almost to the letter. I was really disappointed in the second season. A lot of the major and minor details of the book were changed- they even gave Theon Greyjoy's sister a different name. The story of Danaeris is also totally different- someone steals her dragons- she gets them back, but that's not the point. Oh, and Stannis has sex with the Red Priestess. Right there on his map table. I don't remember THAT happening either. Aria's story is pretty true to the original, but that's small consolation in the larger scheme of things. If you don't appreciate a screen version taking artistic license with the contents, don't bother ordering the second season- you will be very disappointed. If you don't care, it's a good story all the same and the filmography is really quite sumptuous.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is an eye opening book - must have for any IT operations professional.<br />It is of great value even for those that have years of work experience in IT departments.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|We downloaded this to the Kindle by chance, and now it's on of my daughter's favorite stories. She is in full princess mode and at least in this story the princess is the heroine.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good novel, and I enjoyed the presentation of the two characters points of view. I was disappointed by the ending which I thought was abrupt and contrived
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|This movie has so much depth and then at the same time does not. It's very interesting from a psychological prospective--if you're not into those types of films, then this isn't for you. But I can apply several aspects of this film to my daily life experiences; and at the end of the day--that's what a good movie does. Leaves you with a lasting impression.
0761158820|5.0|I love this book! The paper toy monsters are colorful and easy to put together. I have seen kids make awesome monster villages with their monsters as well as play with one monster at a time. I also like that, at the end of the book, they have blank monster templates so that you (or kids) can create your own monsters. I am a therapist and plan to use it with my kid clients in my practice. I also plan to use it with my nephews. It's a great find!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun and I recommend this to any horse lover :)<br />I hag wanted a horse for a while, so this is really cool for me even though in sure its a whole lot different.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|Man the guys playing Tommy Lee are damned GOOD.  Smith is too over the top.  Still the special effects alone are worthy of a look.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Politically and Commercially correct Steven Spielberg has taken Goodwin's masterful description of how Lincoln corralled opposed, ambitious and erratic talent and put them, effectively to the task of saving the UNION, and made it only about the 13 th Amendment. Lincoln freed the slaves to save the UNION. If he could have saved  the Union by not freeing the slaves he would have done so as he stated. One of the very last scenes in the movie is Thadeus Stevens in bed with his black female slave. He hands her the original copy of the passed 13th Amendment to the Constitution.  Spielberg has taken Goodwin's comprehensive work, adulterated it, and given it to those he is in bed with. Complex, heroic Mr. Lincoln is reduced to a pandering simpleton in short, black pants.
1451668945|4.0|I have all of Mary Higgins Clark's books and I enjoy them. Some of them are better than others but they are a nice change from the sexy female in distress and then the hot guy needs to &#34;save&#34; her. This one had me going from beginning to nearly the end when I figured out who did it before it was revealed, but Clark does a nice job throwing distractions along the way.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|The show while amusing at times seems to drag on. The scientific aspects are interesting but do not make up for the dry acting.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is great would be better if it actually was free but u end up buying stuff u need.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Just love it! Suspension, drama, Romance all in one. You need to watch this series. I love to watch it through my Kindle fire HD.
B008C20TDG|4.0|Was definitely a quick easy read, but I thought it was going to be a lot more amazing given all the 5 star reviews it got. Granted I have not started my own whole30, so I will update this review afterwards if I find it &#34;life changing&#34;.... I will definitely give it a shot. I found the book &#34;eat to live&#34; much more inspiring (although these two books offer different nutritional plans, and I'm not sure which is better. Again, I will have to give my own whole30 a shot.) overall I would recommend.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Very excellent game.  Cant wait for an upgrade.  Fun tor the whole family and not just for kids again excellent game
B005GFPZYK|5.0|While, I'm sure, this book only lets us in on a very small part of the war, it is enough for us to see that we should be more grateful as an individual and as a nation for all of our military personnel. Whether they are here or deployed elsewhere, they have offered to die so that we can take our children to the park, go to work, sleep in on Saturday mornings, etc. The small things, the things that stress us out, the things we take completely for granted, are the things they are fighting to protect. Find a soldier and just say Thank You. Thank you Mr. Kyle and to all of you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my son and he was very pleased with the gift.  I watched a couple of the episodes with him and the Blu-ray is so much better than regular VHS.  We were able to notice things that we had not seen before.<br />The quality was terrific and the delivery time on receiving the product was excellent.  I recommend this for everyone.<br />Thanks
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Another amazing season of Downton Abbey.  Loved being able to watch them all right on computer with Amazon Prime.  Thank you!!
B00683JLXA|1.0|If you are going to try and emulate a game that is already popular at least attempt to do a decent job. I'm glad I didn't pay for this poorly done knockoff of Angry Birds. I don't think I deleted this fast enough honestly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game. lot of fun.. no problems highly. regimens and if you rate you get free gems. definitely. download the game
0143119680|5.0|This was definitely not what I expected and captivated me.  Could hardly wait to pick it up for breaks and lunchtime reading.  Bought the second installment.
B007GATVYI|4.0|Simple yet delivering a clear MSG.. I would give a 5 star if the comic is detailed enough...seems like this comic cut too many &#34;scenes&#34; from its original book...
B007SGM084|3.0|Not sure what all the rave was about. It took me forever to read the trilogy. Slow read for me and got bored of the same thing.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I really love this show can't wait to get my copy of season 7. I own the whole series just can't enough of this show.
B003THHIEM|5.0|This is a great series to watch. A fresh look at a drama series. A must see for the whole family.
B007EE564U|5.0|You need to have read the Mitch Rapp series to get the most out of this book, as each follows on from the previous. In fact, some of the previous stories are better than this one. However, I really enjoyed it and did not want the story to finish. I will buy the next in the series without hesitation.
B00C32R64G|5.0|Let me start this out by saying I play guitar and I play a lot of Volbeat.This cd is not much different ,musicaly from thier previous works.They stuck to the basic formula that they always have and I love it.Lola Montes sounds alot like Fallen from the last cd.Yes the production is much diffrent from their other works and to the untrained ear it sounds like the band is trying something different musicaly,when they really are not.The cd is great,I love it!Great lyrics,great harmonies great simple soung structure with the occasional death riff thrown in,nice melaodic solos also.my favorite cd from them is Guitar Gansters And Cadillac Blood.This one stands on it's own as another greatVolbeat,with a few new twists and turns.Doc Holiday,Lola Montes and Hangmans body count to me,are the strongest songs on the cd.Lola Montes alost sounds like it could be a top 40 pop song in a way but,I really like it.Go get yours,you will not be disappointed.Just keep in mind the production is much different on this.It almost sounds a little less dynamic compared to earier works.5 stars***** no jail cell bars!!
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This is a bad movie about what people wish they could say and do but would never. A lot of gross out humor but without the humor. Don't waste your time even if it's free.
1931788340|5.0|What's not to love. A classic photography book featuring the work of one of my favorite photographers. A true inspiration.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mine craft pocket edition is awesome you should buy the game if you like to build it only 7$ there are a lot of new thing in 0.61 you need to get the
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wow!! This book was so much more then I expected. I thought it was going to be a typical romantic comedy but instead the author took us on a journey I hadn't expected.<br /><br />There is some pretty humorous parts in the book but the funniest lines are between Connor and his best friend Jeff. they had me rolling and literally laughing out loud.<br /><br />The story between Megan and Connor was more serious then I expected. These two broken soles who learned not to trust in love or open their hearts to another person who will just end up breaking it happened while both characters were children.<br /><br />Megan because her mother had married seven times while looking for mister right. Seven father figures who Megan got close to only to have them disappear from her life. She ended up having several dead-end relationships all of which ended because she couldn't trust in love. Then the guy she thought she could spend her life with ended up returning from a business trip married to his EX.<br /><br />Connor was the illegitimate son of a married man. A man who flitted though his life but never claimed him publicly. He watched his mother get her heart broken time and again by his father every time his father left yet again till the day she committed suicide when he was thirteen.<br /><br />Megan decides really all she wants is a baby without a husband to complicate matters.<br /><br />Connor want's a wife and children but so as not to involve his heart the marriage he wants is more a business arrangement without love.<br /><br />They meet in Vegas when Megan approaches him to help her save face in front of her Cousin's two best friends. They end up having a great night Drinking, talking, Drinking, laughing, Drinking, Drinking, Drinking.. The next morning they wake up married which is fine for Connor but Megan remembers non of it.<br /><br />What comes next is an emotional roller-coaster for Megan, Connor and the readers. What I loved most about this book is the lack of repeated dialog. Unlike other books where the readers find out what the H/h are thinking and we have to wait till the end to get the whole story, in this book we all find out at the same time.<br /><br />For instance when Megan see's Pete at the grocery store. Pete turns out to be the one father figure who had made it a point to get to know his wife's daughter. He got under her defenses and peeled off the layers of ice around her heart only to break it again when he left her just like the others. Then to make it worse he doesn't recognize her at the grocery store.<br /><br />This book pretty much had it all, the only thing I would have added was at the very end when he presented her with an engagement ring as well as her wedding ring I wish he had proposed they have a second wedding. One that she would remember. But other then that I wouldn't change a thing.
B005I6EU48|5.0|This cover is every bit as nice looking in real life as it is in the picture online. It is very sturdy.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|This series goes back to where it should be.  The TV series and movies have strayed, and the current one set in the USA with a female Watson is beyond belief.
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|The art is beautiful and the game will keep you entertained for many hours. I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys this genre of game.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Don't like it quite as much as &#34;Sigh No More&#34;, but it's still fantastic!!! Mumford & Sons are the best.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a game that is fun to play and can occupy your time and you don't even realize how long you have been playing it.  It is fund and love the colors which make help to make the game interesting and amusing.  I would recommend this game &#34;Diamond Dash&#34; to anyone who loves to playing games.  I like to play it when waiting in the doctor's office.  It sure does help to pass the time.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Love that I can use it either RPN or standard entry.  It's well laid out and not overly complicated.  It &#34;just works&#34;, and without the user having to think through it every time.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Finally!  A game so fun.  I hope they make a second version!  This game is a series of steps to open a box.  Well worth the $1.99!!!
B00821OX98|4.0|So far we've watched about 6 episodes and like the shows premise. I'm catching up on show's I never had a chance to watch.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Amazing game wish there were more rooms. I did like that the hints helped but it didn't give u the answer like some games. It really does make you think though. I loved it!!!!!!!!
B004SDEP38|3.0|Some of the file types are only supported by the full version, which is $15. There are cheaper programs that do the same thing. That said the interface is smooth and clean.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Product was in great condition and all the discs worked really well and did not skip. I was happy with this purchase
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Great romantic story and very pleasant way to spend the time. The lead actors were great  and you felt involved.  The scene in the castles, at dinner and landscapes were wonderful.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The tin got banged up on the way here but thats not  really a big deal. All the discs worked great and I was quite please with my purchase
B00A31UXLW|5.0|If you love Harry then this will not disappoint, as with fine wine he just gets better with age, no matter how many times he's put down.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|The movie was in great condition and the disc worked perfectly fine. Did not skip at all. I was happy with my purchase
B009IF82SK|5.0|This series is always a great show to watch to just get a chuckle or two. I cant wait to see what happens next!
B000068TPN|5.0|The movie was in great condition and the disc worked perfectly fine. Did not skip at all. I was happy with my purchase
B006X5L6VS|5.0|I have barely looked at this, but know I will really enjoy it.  Think the grandchildren are going to have fun and it's so educational.
B000065U1N|5.0|The movie was in great condition and the disc worked perfectly fine. Did not skip at all. I was happy with my purchase
B002UWH8P6|5.0|I was very disappointed that Stargate Universe got canceled, a real poor choice on scifi channel's part. I at least can re-watch it here on Prime video and dream about a movie that will never be and the demise of good science fiction on television.
B00005RHGL|4.0|The disc skipped a few times but wasnt too bad. Other than that it worked just fine. Product came in the time it said. No other problems
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I like this game, because the pudding characters remind me of Bob from monsters vs aliens :) it's kinda sad when you accidentally slide them off the table....but it's funny too :)
B0001HLVS2|5.0|The movie was in great condition and the disc worked perfectly fine. Did not skip at all. I was happy with my purchase
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like this version better because of the touch screen controls. It makes it easier to select tiles, and as for level select, it's not really necessary. The point of this version is that you beat it level by level, and it gets more challenging as you go like most games.
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|ANOTHER CLASSIC TO LISTEN TO AND HE MAKES MOTOWN PROUD ONCE AGAIN, CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH OF HIS MUSIC, FABULOUS
0812993845|1.0|I have read most of the authors other novels and I really enjoyed them...I know I'm going to get a light funny Rom com...War and Peace it is not..but this almost 500 page tome had a ludicrous story line...I know I'm getting older..but I wouldn't want to be or know anyone like the characters in this book...I sped read it just to get it done...don't waste your money on this..wish I hadn't.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Why didn't I give this 5 stars? Maybe I'm feeling a little particular today.  I don't have much criticism... Just that the author chose pace over character development in these books, maybe. I liked what he did so much, I just wanted more.  I found myself slogging through some of the violent parts of this.  Not my cup of tea... But overall, loved the concept, story and characters!
B000AQJPQE|1.0|I son received this for his birthday from a grandparent.  We set it up and the gears grind to a stop and just sounds horrible.<br /><br />We contacted uncle milton, they told me to return it to the store. I told them it was a gift and the purchaser doesn't live near us. They basically told me that was my only option.  After insisting they do more, they said that I could ship it to them at my expense and someone would try and fix it, but no guarantees.  Yes that is right, I would pay to ship it to them and they MIGHT fix it. I figure I would never get it back.<br /><br />After I realize that avenue was a bust, my husband took it apart and did manage to get it working.<br /><br />It's a little loud and kinda boring.  You can only see the bottoms of the planets, they aren't tilted or anything, and the bottoms are the least designed -- they are kinda designed like the plastic covers you melt around easter eggs where you have the design around the sides but solid color bottom and top. The rings around saturn is cardboard.<br /><br />Granted my son is only 3 but he LOVES planets, solar systems, space. We read books about it constantly.  This gift is up on the ceiling and forgettable. We also had to put a big enough hole in the ceiling to cringle a little.
1400049628|5.0|I bought this for my brother for Christmas.  He loved it. It's a great gag gift! :)  And hey you learn some useful things as well!  Definately a fun gift to give.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Got it for free with the camera. Good for tracking and carrying the camera love it instead of the standard bag as it easy to use and more safe to keep the camera.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Fantastic movie worth owning. Got a sweet deal on this purchase. Can't wait to watch it back to back with the original animated Hobbit.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started the series from the beginning about a month ago, my schedule has been busy with a new job. But I'm enjoying it! So different from ANYTHING on TV today. Great acting, love some of the characters and despise others.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So much easier than carrying around books, they are all on my phone! You can look up words u don't understand and change the font to fit your needs and it keeps your place when you exit. In all very awesome...... I love it!!
B004478AS4|2.0|Too many yams for my taste.  Okonkwo is never happy, not even at the end. Depressing and sad. Not my cup of tea.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|There were parts of the book that didn't have much impact on me because they dealt with childcare issues and I don't have kids.  It is still great insight into what other women deal with.  What I like most about this book is that I see myself in so many of the things she discusses. It helped me to realize that my anxiety and lack of confidence are common. I am not alone!  I can say that as I look back at past experiences, we really do get treated differently than our male counterparts.  We have come so far but there is still work to be done.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game, I'm addicted. You get daily credits and there is a free tournament everyday, and the more items you collect the more you get everyday. It just keeps getting better!
B008476HBM|5.0|What can I say!  It is a wonderful classic and enjoyable every time I read it!  The language is delightful after reading so many modern books with contemporary dialogue.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|I had two BU353 GPS pucks that worked fine until I had to get a new laptop that meant I HAD to have Windows 8 ( I hate it) and Win8 would not run the standard BU353 GPS puck that I had and was only one year old but the BU 353 S4 does work with Microsoft's lates nightmare,  after a few hours of uninstalling original and installing new drivers.  Plug and play to me means just that and to me new software should be backward compatible not a means of enforced extra expenditure on new kit, but I finally beat this one into submission and it now works good as a navigational plotter using opencpn chart plotter software with a Google earth plug in linked to it  as well.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|The price was right. Preamps are solid and sound great. Quiet. I would recommend this for any singer songwriter. Easy to use if you have a Mac!
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I love it its so cute graet for kids and I'm only 10 and I'm saying it I rate this a 5 star
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The graphics are great  and that the characters look great and have awesome powers. I however don't like how everything costs gems to buy.
1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton is rapidly becoming one of my favorite authors, along with Maeve Binchy and Elizabeth George!  The Secret Keeper was a wonderful read, with well developed characters and a fascinating plot which moved back and forth across time periods.  Sometimes that can become tedious and hard to follow, but I found that in this book, I never became confused or annoyed with jumping to a new time period, since the transitions were very well done.  I occasionally enjoy a story that is \\"light\\" without a lot of deep plot, what some people refer to as a \\"good beach read,\\" but I especially enjoy this type of book with many well-drawn characters, and a plot that is engaging, and not always predictable.  Looking forward to Kate Morton's next book!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Wife and I really enjoyed this movie. Picture quality was excellent. We also watch many other movies with our prime account.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I's still trying to decipher all of it LOL (reading the books helps). I am completely satisfied with purchasing it off Amazon.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I skipped Book 4 because it did not have my favorite characters.  This is great and I don't feel like I have missed a lot.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is well written. The characters are developed beautifully. This story of our quest to be happy hits to close. Great book for the young adults as well as Marie readers. A must!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the character development and how they can make killing zombies different every episode. Wish I had cable and did not have to buy my episodes.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Doctor Who is such a creative and innovative show that not only entertains but engages the mind to think outside the box.  The humanity of the Doctor is unparalleled as he encounters moral situations in which he struggles to make the right decisions.  I'm definitely hooked on Doctor Who!
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|good game I have played this game to kill time. however game froze and restarted me back at level 1. not going to waste my time startingvall over.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Season 5 has been a great season!! Having beckett and castle as a couple has just expanded the storytelling of the show!, it is amazing!  Hope it has 10 more seasons!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book I've read this year. I love this book there's no word to describe it. It is that good
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Dame Maggie is as always superb.  Visually fine.  Good cast.<br />The books are better but this is SO worth a watch!
0817439390|5.0|The first three chapters of this book completely changed the way that I approach my camera. It makes you want to turn the dial to manual. Very cool book.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Daft Punk hits it just right with this retro sounding tune. Every girl I know loves this song when they hear it, so that works for me !
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Excellent DVD, we would highly recommend it for anyway, even if you never thought you were a Rush fan in the 80's
030758836X|4.0|I had heard a lot about this book and I was not disappointed. A great story of perception or misperception!  I got so involved, I was sorry to see it finally come to an end.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a fine app for maybe a teen but a little juvenile for average person even when really bored.
B008MM9630|4.0|loving it so far...will see how it goes. awesome graphics! it seems very peaceful playing rather than hurry up as many games seem to make u feel. i can see myself playing for hours! it's different from other farming type games just because of the whole fairy theme.
0061353248|5.0|This is an important book. In Predictably Irrational Dan Ariely highlights how our cognitive machinery frequently results in irrational behaviour. The book is an amalgate of experimental psychology and economics, with various practical applications. Ariely is a professor in Behavioural Economics and Psychology at Duke University. He's a respected academic in the field, writes a blog and is a regular speaker on the corporate speech circuit. This NY Times best seller is Ariely's first book.<br /><br />I first developed an interest in behavioral economics as an economics student reading about bounded rationality. My professor at the time recommended I read Kahneman and Tversky's Judgement under Uncertainty, a telephone book sized compilation of research which led Kahneman to becoming the first non-economist recipient of the Nobel Prize in economics. This book is the \\"light\\" version, and hence a more succinct and palatable introduction to the field. The book draws on the clever experiments conducted by Ariely's team and his wide network of collaborators. It turns out each of us is a collection of many \\"selves\\" with varying behaviour depending on the circumstances. We don't save enough for our retirement, we overpay for brands; not only does Coke taste better than Pepsi, but a 50 cent pill relieves pain better than its cheap generic equivalent. We have an emotional hot button for anything FREE, become anchored into initial prices too easily, check our email (and stock prices) too often etc.<br /><br />Predictably Irrational consists of an introduction followed by 15 distinct chapters, each covering a particular topic. The chapters can be read independently if one has a particular interest in a certain topic. Each chapter begins with an anecdote to draw the reader into the experiment. Results are revealed and relevant conclusions are drawn with digestible direct applications. Ariely is Isreali and not overly concerned with appearing politically correct. Personally I likedhis direct writing style. Make sure you purchase the revised and expanded version of the book, which is more comprehensive and better edited. The first four chapters are the most interesting. The latter studies can become a little repetitive but are still well worth reading. The book proceeds at a fast pace and sometimes I found myself going back to reread chapters in order to remember key insights.<br /><br />So what can one learn from the book? When negotiating, it's helpful to anchor your counterparty early, throw out a low price, because invariably he/she will not adjust sufficiently. When presenting alternatives include a \\"decoy\\", that's how the Economist was able to sell more expensive subscriptions. When designing a menu, include a $50 lobster option because even if no one buys it, it will allow you to price other dishes higher. In management, cash is often the most expensive way to motivate staff and asking your personnel to recite a moral code reduces cheating and encourages good behaviour.<br /><br />I urge the reader to judge these results within the specific context in which they were conducted and the subjects used. At times, Ariely extrapolates a little too freely and tends to interpret his results as being more applicable than they perhaps are (the behavioural economics community isn't immune to confirmation bias). As anyone worth their two cents in statistics knows, obtaining a significant result in the social science can be achieved through clever study design and endpoint definition. Moreover, we don't see all of the studies that were excluded for lack of theory confirmation. Finally, the MIT and Duke students on which the experiments were conducted may not always be representative of the general population.<br /><br />Overall, the book is an exciting and highly readable foray into the field of behavioural economics made interesting by Ariely's experiments and often counterintuitive results.<br /><br />This is a review by investingbythebooks.com
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|kept me wanting more, liked all the hidden obejct games and scary things around could not put down till I was done.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Love This Game. This Game Allows You To Be Very Creative. I Hope They Update Minecraft Pocket Edition So There Could Be Mating. Hope You Have Fun Playing!!! :D
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|There is no need to turn to tv or movies to get the thrill of Follett's On Wings of Eagles.  It was wonderful; so interesting that money can buy what diplomacy cannot.  Ross Porot is my new hero of human compassion.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book. This is the best book I've read in ages! Such a neat and great read!
B0009UC810|5.0|This movie NEVER disappoints!  After all these years, it still evokes great memories of Chicago in the '60s, and the Belushi/Ackroyd combination was one of the funniest comedy teams ever.  I don't know...maybe you have to be from Chicago to get some of the stuff, but you can't beat the the straight-out, puerile, destroy everything humor here.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|If you are filming with you Ipod, this is a nice way to view it on your television, well made. I would recommend to a friend.
B000HEVALC|3.0|Worth a listen but not Grammy material. I bought this recording after taking the Sun Studio tour in Memphis. so I wanted something for a memento. The recording is pretty cool, but is merely a jam session. The recording is very basic, but if you like musical history or are a fan of any of the artists on the recording then buy it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an amazing show. I'm a fan of walking dead, The Office, and this show is just as good! Great story lines, acting is first rate, I know it seems like a risk. That it might seem tedious or boring. It's neither. Just give it a chance and you'll be sucked in.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app serves the purpose. It is a great digital alarm clock. I like the fact that I can choose my alarm tone plus adjust the brightness of the clock.
B00BWJ91XK|4.0|I read this story growing up and it really introduced me to reading and all that it would come to mean to me. This movie lived up to that. It wasn't equal to my imagination of course but it was full of its own wonderful light. Enough to spark new imaginations. Great great movie
0060989157|5.0|Tells the real story of the rock & roll life style from 4 guys who lived it to the extreme.  Great read, I could not put the book down
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best calculator app in the store. I have tried a lot of calculator apps and love this one. Thanks so much.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I got this game because everyone was talking about it.  This not the type of game I find fun. Flying birds into things to knock them down, not for me
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I first watched the movie which was fantastic, decided to read the book, it is all in the movie for the most part but like the movie the book was easy to follow and read, now I've watched the movie a couple more times, I really like everything about it.  If you were or are socially awkward you have to watch/read The Perks of Being a Wallflower!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I was not a fan of Nickelback, until this CD.  Their songs are hard, edgy and make me just want to sing and dance with every track
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Somewhat difficult to read as scenes and characters shift back and forth. The reader must acknowledge the consequences of selfishness, arrogance, and greed.
0743486285|5.0|I was able to learn about Nikki`s life, and all that he went through to be the man he is today
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent read! Could. Not. put. it. down. I am so glad it read this! I definitely recommend getting this book.
B001HN6922|5.0|This sequel was not as good as the original, but this was a lot  like a 007 Bond movie, with all the action and suspense
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|It was no secret that Roosevelt had a strong dislike for Lindbergh but I was surprised to so much of the book devoted tot he Lindberghs.<br /><br />I read a number of works about this time and it was a refreshing approach to see Roosevelt in a more human light.<br /><br />A great read!
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I did not know who Shinedown was until this CD.  I have become a fan and because of this CD I went to see them in concert.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My kids love this game, but sometimes they need my help. Sometimes it's a very addictive, and hard, other times it is fun and very easy.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Kurt Sutter got back to the story lines us SOA fans love about the show.  I am addicted to this series and never miss an episode
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|This game is great, very creative, fun and a bit challenging. I got it as the free app of the day. I haven't played all the way through but from what I have played it was quite enjoyable.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|The song I bought this CD for was Bad Girlfriend, but after I heard the rest of this CD, I was a fan
B007MCTTHY|5.0|The game in fun. You rearrange the pipes to make the liquids go where they need to go. Some of the puzzles are easy, others more challenging. After completing everything, I passed it on to my 4,6, & 8 yr old. They loved it too. They enjoyed the concept of getting the liquid through the pipes, and even making it \\"fail\\" on purpose. I got the app when it was the free app of the day, but still, at the 99 cent price I would say its worth it. Its a nice time killer. I just hope they come out with more \\"books\\" one day.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I wish I had seen this in 3D in the theatre, but never got the chance. The 3D bluray is great and lived up to my expectations, however.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|My husband and I met by way of listen to Boz Scaggs! The CD Sounds great and he has not stop playing it!!
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|This is one of those movies that is really good and makes you think, but once you see it, there's no reason to watch it again. Rental type movie.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Hollywood did a great job! The music follows every scene of the movie. One could close your eyes and see it all again.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|Fan of the books, fan of the movies. Movies were better, finally, in my opinion. The last big eye-opener was still confusing to me, SPOILER!!!::: ---<br /><br />I still don't quite get it about the coming back to life thing. Maybe I missed something in the books, but he had a lot of choices to die by voldemort and come back and he only did at that point? Didn't make sense to me.
B00008WT5E|5.0|I really love this album. To me there are no dud songs. The production is still Vanda & Young which I think gave a grittier edge and really exploited the 2 guitar sound. This was their last outing with Vanda & Young until much later on the Blow up your Video album. After this they brought in Mutt Lange who proceded in giving them a more commercial/polished sound. An Aussie classic!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie, great action, great 3D. A movie I watch over and over. Love the Hulk! Effects look great in 3D.
B00APVC8BI|5.0|I don't shop at Wal*Mart, so I was not aware the SteelBook was out there until I saw it used on Amazon.<br /><br />I really enjoy watching this movie, especially the extended cut, for a few different reasons. I think this storyline is better than the original, with much more depth of character, alot less dorkiness, and just incredible sets and CG imagery. I have already watched it twice since receiving it, and I will definitely watch it many more times in the future.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|This movie was good, but didn't have quite the impact of the first one. A few of the cars reminded me of Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars. Just bad character choices from the creator :/
B00AO686MY|5.0|I forgot how much fun this movie was, as it has been quite some time since it's original release.<br /><br />Here we have a nice quality transfer to Blu-ray disc, with ease of menu navigation. A deleted scene with some background info was a nice added-feature. This looks great in full HD, no complaints from this blue-collar videophile. Comes with a second disc of the movie on a standard DVD.
B0016492BW|3.0|I LOVED this flick in my high school days. I bought it when it was a good price to reminisce and turns out it's not as funny these days.
0062215507|5.0|The book arrived in excellent condition.  It was a gift for my grandson so I can't judge the contents as it was wrapped.  Very happy with response time and condition.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|But this series was amazing.  My first digital book and what a series to start on! It was intense. Great story.
B0074JODP8|5.0|What a concert! Fantastic music and setup. Bonamassa's playing is phenomenal. Just love his style and his singing. Phew the melodies he creates. Guests add great colour and depth to the concert - Beth Hart, John Hiatt and Paul Rodgers. This concert DVD is a must have even if you are not a Bonamassa fan!
B003O86FMW|5.0|But this series was amazing.  My first digital book and what a series to start on! It was intense. Great story.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|A great movie at a great price. Makes me excited for the next one to come out this year. Action is great (the book is better, as usual) but a great show regardless.
B000085RPU|2.0|disc will not play in your region  disc error *2**45* in the  u.s.a. look before you buy or sent it back
B004LWZW4C|5.0|As with all the other X-Men's this was a good story as well. Another origin story, and I guess they're doing an origin story for Wolverine here in another year. Great stuff!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I choose that rating because its a really good book and I loved it. I loved everything about it. I would recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a good read
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|But this series was amazing.  My first digital book and what a series to start on! It was intense. Great story.
B00051E906|5.0|For good price give a quick reading for stones too hot.... to work with... that come out of mine....easy to use
B006H5120E|5.0|I saw the original in the theatre and haven't seen this since. This was great to see in 3D! Great sound, cool effects. Fine buy.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I like it because it helps me learn new things.<br /><br />It also helps the world learn new things.<br /><br />by Cloey in california
1400032717|3.0|This novel is a failure.<br /><br />I will not say I was unentertained. Nor will I say that this novel was a waste of my time, nor that it is an awful novel, nor that it is a misbegotten sack of vomit. Rather, it simply failed.<br /><br />Haddon set out to fulfil two goals. 1) Make the reader empathize with people who have autism. 2) Write a clever postmodern mystery story.<br /><br />We are to empathize with Christopher, and so following the logic of the frontspiece blerbs, come to empathize with all autistic people everywhere. There is one problem with this. Christopher is a terrible person. He's uncaring, entirely devoted to himself. I know that autism vastly lowers empathy for others, etc, but Christopher is entirely unmoved by a certain character's pain, or anyone's pain, save his own. This isn't anything like those with autism that I know.<br /><br />Worse, Christopher is a monster. Chapter 229 explains, in brutal detail, how he wishes that everyone who isn't like him will die horrible painful deaths at the hands of a human computer virus (they'll all crash their cars, or drown themselves, or any other terrible end that you can imagine). It's horrific.<br /><br />This doesn't make me feel empathy with Christopher, this makes me hate him. This could turn into grounds for autistic children to be beaten and bullied. It's not Haddon's intent, but there's hardly a kinder reaction to three pages spent with a detailed account of how he wishes everyone in the world suffers brutal deaths.<br /><br />Also, as an aside: Christopher's bit how computers are exactly like the human brain and function like us makes the computer programmer inside me scream. It's like saying, \\"That abacus is just like our brain; that jackhammer can hold conversations.\\" They're machines built to a task, and any tme they replicate a human task, there are always fobiles and weakpoints. Try speaking to Jabberwacky if you doubt this. I should expect Christopher, the maths expert, to know this full well.<br /><br />On the second count, this is an awful mystery novel. Not an awful novel, but an awful mystery. This count may not be Haddon's fault. He might not have had the slightest intention to write an Honest-to-God-Above mystery. But each person who recommended it to me called it a \\"brilliaint\\" mystery, the title is a quote from my ninth favorite Sherlock Holmes story, and detective fiction is evoked all though the book (both in the obvous--discussions of Conan Doyle and an error-ridden discussion of the cliches of Sherlock Holmes--to a pet rat named after the dog Holmes so often rented).<br /><br />There are no clues, no clear deliniation of thought, no rousing mystery. We pass from a state of befuddlement to a state of this-is-stupid clarity so quickly that even the narrator fails to comprehend it. This is not how to write a mystery.<br /><br />BUT WAIT! you may say, there is another mystery, the mystery of the woman who was not dead. But this is not a mystery: it is a thing which happens, without context. We had only the softest idea of a mystery before Haddon screams the solution in our ears.<br /><br />He reveals the solution to both when more than 100 pages remain. The plot is resolved at that instant; all else is epilogue. And a dreadful, movement filled epilogue at that.<br /><br />If this is what Haddon believes makes a fine mystery, I hope he finds a new genre.<br /><br />(P.S. The one truly terrible part of the novel, when we view it solely as a novel, are the arguments against the existence of God. Believe what you will about God himself, but the arguments presented here are so exceptionally bad that even Dawkins would look doubtful. Hitchens is rolling in his grave. They all, essentially, amount to God's not real, nah-nah. Its awfullness cannot be contained by words, pretty little bastards of language that they are. I'm very much into philosophy. I wonder if Haddon did any research into Holmes or computers or philosophy before penning this.)
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Duplicates my desktop,  Media Center TV works great in windowed mode.Able to print docs and pictures using my desktop computers programs.
B00683JLXA|3.0|This game is pretty much an imitation of the popular franchise Angry Birds. It's like Angry Birds with a Kung Fu Panda theme. Don't get me wrong I love Angry Birds but this is nothing compared to it. It's in okay game but it's nothing to write home about.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|GREAT reading especially if you love the television show, \\" Castle\\".  This is his first book on Nikki Heat aka Kate Beckett.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|in the waiting room at the doctor's office. Or at a funeral parlor. Or anywhere where laughing out loud all by yourself would be considered a sign of instability. People may give you strange looks and scoot away from you. I laughed so hard at this book that I cried a couple of times. If you liked 30 Rock and Tina Fey's work on Saturday Night Live, you will definitely want to buy this book.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|There is a complicated and touching story line that explores the relationship between 2 young people. You forget while reading it that they ar 26 and 21, but their lives seem so much older at times, but then their youth will pop out at unexpected times. Can't wait to get the third book!
B007XGJK4G|4.0|Long overdue is a bio-pic on this important artist. The footage is powerful and informative, but the film itself suffers, only moderately, from a lack of editing. There's a lot to recommend here but some of the interviews with his associates could be trimmed. Still, I came away with an even greater respect for Marley and knowledge about his career I hadn't heard about elsewhere.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|The acting was pretty bad, but they made up for it with over the top, ridiculous bloody scenes, bad special effects and even incoherent battle/chase scenes.  I watched the whole thing though, but I'm a sadist.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really ejoyed this series.  It makes you wonder what this world might be like years down the road.  Bougt the first book because of the movie and just had to get the others.
B002361MLA|5.0|I would recommend this book strongly to anyone who wants to get the most out of life. Excellent and Life altering.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|I am just in the middle of reading this one.  So far I like what I am reading.  It caught my attention in the beginning
B00881PTRC|5.0|I love the animation and it's fun to play!!!  I haven't played hangman in years and this is a cool version!!!
B005GQ5IA0|4.0|I Am Legend is way too different than the movie. I'll recommend it to everyone who is looking for a SF novel.
B000X2H8G4|2.0|Does not preform as well as you claim it will , that foam cover over the mic. never stays put the clip mount is poorly designed and when you have to run it at a high volume as I have to the sound just blares at you, I had to go to a Williams this thing just was not cutting it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Kid takes this game over she loves it.I'm glad I bought this kindle fire HD.Love everything about it.Thanks amazon this is a great store.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was reading this book, the day I wanted to go to the movies, so I sat down and read the whole thing in a day. When I went to see the film, it felt like the two were entirely different stories. The characters are a lot deeper and their emotions so explicit in the book. I loved reading the book and would recommend anyone to read the book, over watching the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|pocket edition u don't get zombies but It is my fave game you have to craft stuff in survivornmode its really cool
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a fast read and it goes right into the story. It is unpredictable and heartbreaking. The topic of death is ever-present, but I still smiled and while reading a lot of the book. Just how life is I guess
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just like the title, I think this is the best house game ever! It's addicting, fun, and great entertainment for kids. It's great for learning too, if you want your kids to know things like how to clean, feed, and take good care of a horse. You can enter competitions, and put your horse in carnival stuff as well. Best app ever!<br />Get the app! :-D
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was interested in reading the book since I heard a movie based on it was coming out soon.  I figured it would be an above-average killing-zombies book.  I was pleasantly surprised that the book is almost entirely about the &#34;survivors&#34; as they recall their experiences.  Max Brooks weaves the storyline through the eyes of many different people from different countries, backgrounds, and experiences to advance the narrative.  I highly recommend.  WARNING:  It's a little addictive.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was such an incredible book, as we all know Rick Riordan is a very original and creative writer. But even on his standards this was absolutely amazing. Please get it, for your own good Percy Jackson fans, get it.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|This film is based on H.P. Lovecraft's story of the same name. I am a huge horror fan and I did not watch it untill about 3 years ago. I have to say I was overly impressed. Horror and zombie film fans will like it with its campieness with a little campy touch, view it definitely. The only book to screen Lovecraft film I really like.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an addicting game.You can get up to 10000000 coins if you save them all,then you can buy any character you want,but if you want the alien you have to get the mystery box and if you get a U.F.O. and have,I think like 150 or 50 you can get it. I've been trying to get the alien,but I  couldn't,so now I'm saving my coins.This is the best game ever. =D
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just absolutely love this app. It's like a huge digital bulletin board. I add my favs and get to browse & look at what others find interesting. Fabulous app.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have this app 4 stars because I often run into issues with it having to be &quot;forced closed&quot;. I'm not sure if it's my Kindle or this app. Anyways, ever since I became a Pinterester, I've been hooked.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Use it daily. Great app. A Must Have as far as I am concerned. Love that it syncs, adds photos, quick notes, etc.
630471193X|5.0|I have watched this movie many times and can become engrossed for the entire movie. And it always makes me cry.
B00846REIS|4.0|Heavy subject matter, but the story has sucked me in for sure. Moving on to the next. Want more Gideon.
B007ZKY7V6|3.0|Big fan of Scissor Sisters, but was somewhat disappointed compared with their previous release. I guess every group has to try other things.
0345803507|5.0|Loved the story but the explicit sex could have been a litle less explicit.  Love the characters of Christian and Anna.
B00006L9ZT|4.0|Fairly standard rendition of the Ring Cycle. It is a traditional staging with realistic sets & costumes. Have to agree that it is probably the best version for those who have never seen it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Was it perfect? No, but it did a great job of tying up what needed to be while leaving some mysteries for the reader to ponder. I, for one, prefer stories that don't answer everything.
B0072OFM28|5.0|You have to get Season 2 but not sure if you have to have Season 3. The new Spartacus tries to be like the original actor but barely.
B007SGM084|5.0|Absolutely the most amazing book trilogy I have ever read. Please write another saga with Christian and Anastasia!<br />I could not put the books down.
B000P0J024|5.0|Why didn't I buy this when it first came out? I must have been asleep at the wheel! Do not hesitate to add this one to your collection.
B00BLGDFH2|5.0|Another home run for Grohl.  I don't think this guys is capable of putting out garbage. Super compilation album with multiple musicians and singers.  My favorites are associated with the old stoner rock bands.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Real sci-fi.  Not &#34;paranormal romance&#34;, which is clogging up the sci-fi/fantasy lists these days, but honest to goodness real science fiction!  Absolutely loved it.
B000002KFJ|4.0|Ozzy this, Ozzy that. OK, I'll give him his due. But the guitar work on this LP is what makes it fly. And it's the reason why I like this one better than the earlier Sabbath LPs. Ozzy doesn't really change from album to album, but Iommi slashes and rumbles like never before. He has taken his chops to another level on \\"Sabotage\\". And the seguing of electric into acoustic guitar on \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" is flawless. As has been stated before in this forum, Sabbath would never be this good again. But don't blame the guitar player for the group's artistic comedown.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|First let me say that I am not a Star Trek fan, I watched this movie for the first time and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />I am a fan of Ricardo Montalban
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|This release is proof that even the best don't hit a home run with every swing. &#34;People, Hell & Angels&#34; is nothing more than a collection of B-siders that were thrown on the cutting room floor for a reason...they're not very good.  Was hoping for a nugget or two of brilliance but just came away disappointed.  I can only recommend &#34;Somewhere&#34; and even then just the intro, which does have a classic Hendrix sound & style.  Should've known  better...
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|This record is Steven's high water mark. I am a long time fan of Porcupine Tree (whom I greatly enjoy). But the musicianship and writing here is over the top. Steven has surrounded himself with top-flight musicians (Guthrie Govan, Marco Minneman, Nick Beggs, Theo Travis and Adam Holzman) who deliver the best. I was fortunate enough to see them in DC recently. Their performance was nearly beyond words. To be in a nice theater with a bunch of greying progheads (and even some younger folks) for this show was an extreme pleasure. If you get a chance to see this line-up perform 'Raven' you will not be disappointed.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I love the quality of this record and most days CD booklets and cases are rarely worth looking at- but this is a quality CD over all. I love how Depeche Mode are able to keep that classic sound but with a genre twist each time. This CD is more mature, and indeed probably for the more mature audience. If you're a fan of this band you'll want it in your music arsenal.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The movie is a cartoon version of the book, with no character development and little to recommend it to any who have not read the book.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I absolutely love this app! I would even say I am a little obsessed with it trying to figure out each solution!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is one of the best kids movies ever. I gave this as a gift and the person I gave it to was very excited, I recommend this for anyone who has children
B006LSZECO|4.0|We read this for our monthly book club. Wow! The psychopathology of the characters was very well done. Gripping! I liked the book so much I immediately downloaded her other two and read them as well. I look forward to more from this author.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Haven't read the books but really enjoyed the movie Waiting for part two to come out to see what happens next crazy!!!!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It was an entertaining story;  kind if hard to get into- the beginning seemed to be an education on his different explorations of his faith. I was somewhat confused with the ending- I like to believe it was the tiger in the boat the whole time with him.
B008220DGE|1.0|Today's film industry turns out many dumb movies.  \\"The Master\\" is a prime example of one of most stupid movies ever made.  With his great talent as an actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman should have avoided this script like the plague! B
B00B125QRS|5.0|For those of us loathe to buying the same music over and over, this no-frills box set is priced just right.
B000002GB9|5.0|I needed to buy this CD because I am reading a Styx biography that I purchased through Amazon (thank you, Amazon!!) and I wanted to listen to the music as I read about each album. It's a blast!!!
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I know that all of you have seen very long reviews of this film, so mine will be short, sweet and cut right to the point.<br /><br />I saw Titanic 3D the day it came out.  It was astonishing!  It felt like a whole new film.  There were so many parts that popped out at you, and you felt like you were really there!<br /><br />Titanic is astonishing with or without 3D.  In my opinion, it is the best film ever made.<br /><br />If you have a 3D TV, then this is worth seeing in 3D.  If you don't, than watch it anyway!<br /><br />Titanic is a movie worth seeing over and over again!  3D or not.<br /><br />In conclusion, Titanic is the greatest film of all time!
B0002XMF5S|5.0|Tony Iommi was the only one who kept the Blacck Sabbath music going when adversity reared its ugly head.<br />Way to go!!!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The Avengers is simply spectacular.  From plot to acting to characters to visuals and beyond; The Avengers is amazing!<br /><br />I love this movie!  It is absolutely fantastic!  Please watch this fun movie for all!<br /><br />Please buy this.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|I really should have looked at the 1 star reviews before I rented this horrible adaptation. In my mind the most important thing about Les Mis is the music (it is a musical after all). Well the singing is the movie is horrible, none of the main cast can sing. What a waste of time. If you want to see Les Mis on screen take a look at one of the anniversary shows, they will bring tears to your eyes (and not because your ears hurt as with this movie)
B0041VP1FI|5.0|Interesting and Unique.<br /><br />I always appreciate a good sci fi movie, which I put this in that category. Give it a try!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Very good keyboard best available in my opinion great predictions and quick typing. Try this keyboard if you are looking you will not be disappointed.
0345803485|4.0|Well I would rate it a 3.5 if given the option. What I like about the book it gives ideas for improving your sex life. But the book is only averagely written and I have No desire to buy any of the other two books of the trilogy. I understand how this book turns women on, because they fantasize about having an erotic man like Christian Grey.
B0044C3RB4|4.0|This season gets bogged down a bit with too-complicated plots, but all in all the third season is as good as the first two.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Story and puzzles were great! It keeps you playing until the end. All the long back tracking wasn't too bad but it was a bit tedious. Can't wait for the next part.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|i really enjoy all the songs on this compilation, a good alternative if you have already hot rocks 64 - 71
B00BI73CVI|5.0|With a cast like this-my attention was easily held! The singing was so heartfelt-and I love Anne Hathaway! Great Movie!
B003TTCURU|5.0|Wife lovse to sit around and and watch this stuff, she can wait for all the other seasons to come out
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I never took so long reading a book until now. So much detail. I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The book is set up with every character getting a chapter and then just when one is deep into their story, we are left hanging and we go to another character that gets a whole chapter. This is in the beginning frustrating because the start of every new chapter left me a bit uninterested, but the story picks up quickly every time. And once you get in deeply, there it stops again to follow up on a new person. It left me curious and very much in anticipation to read on as much and as quickly as I could. For me this worked wonderfully. I loved it and found it one of the best in the series.
0525478817|5.0|You will laugh you and will cry and that's just in the first 10 pages.<br /><br />This book has the emotion found in \\"my sisters keeper\\" along with the relationships and friendships found in \\"the perks of being wallflower\\". You will be touched.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I know that sounds crazy and a bit morbid, but that is exactly what you do in this game.  It can really be a challege, and I think it is very entertaining as well.  Definitely give this game a try.  It really makes you think about globalization and potential consequences.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. I was a little designer frighten by the subject matter.. But the author makes you see this terrible subject from a different angle. It was wonderful . I could not but it down . I did not want it to end
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I usually try not to spend too much money on games, but I just can 't help it with this game.  This game is so fun and challenging!  I do recommend this game, but in order to beat the higher levels I have found it neccessary to spend money.  Props to you if you can do it without buying &#34;monkey money.&#34;
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A classic movie with the right amount of back story and character development.  Would watch this one again for sure.
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|I think this app is okay.  The story line is cheesy and it is very easy to complete the rounds with the power ups available.  I like a little more of a challenge.  It would probably be fun for kids ages 10-12.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|The cast and animation are great.  Ice Age Continental Drift was funny for the adults and kids to wach.  Great movie!
B007R41E8O|5.0|I really liked this game.  I think it is just challenging enough to keep you interested and not get frustrated.  If you liked Lost City,  Mystery of Crimson Manor,  or games similar,  you should really get this game. You will really enjoy it!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|A Classic movie with the right amount of back story and character development.  Would watch this one again for sure.
0345803485|1.0|I always thought that books were objects that should be treated well, like as a reader it was my duty to ensure that no pages were crinkled or torn, no ink, pencil or highlighter touched any of its content and so forth. I have always had some sort of respect for books, regardless of whether I like their content or not. \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" made me do something I'm not proud of.<br /><br />I did not know anything about this trilogy, other than the fact that it was much hyped about and that it was some sort of erotic novel. Looking at it in retrospect, I must admit I was rather naive to think that something so over-sensationalized would live up to my usual high expectations. At the beginning I was pretty curious and full of hope, devouring every word... for the first few chapters. Then, gradually as I kept flipping the pages, I had to wonder - Is this really it? Is this what everyone is so blown away by? Really? REALLY?!<br /><br />A couple chapters into the book, I couldn't help but start frowning at the bad writing. Clearly the author did not do her research about young American females, otherwise surely she would have excluded some typically British expressions. I simply could not relate to or even like any of the characters. I felt frustrated that Anastasia didn't do a whole lot more than \\"blush\\", \\"flush\\", \\"peek up at Christian\\" from under her eyelashes and generally act helpless and passive throughout the novel. Christian was simply \\"too good\\": he was too hot, too rich, too good in bed, too mysterious and of course he had to have a troubled past which made him too cliche to respond to as a reader. Personally I found him boring as he seemed to have been created from a formula based on every soccer mom's wet dream.<br /><br />I usually don't do this, but after I read the how Anastasia \\"flushed\\" for the 100th time, I hurled the book across the room, slamming it against the wall. I may have also screamed some obscenity about what I think should be \\"flushed\\". The book survived my act of rage without much damage, but I could not continue reading it. Two-thirds down the way, I gave up. I hated it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great Comedy movie with the right amount of back story and character development.  Would watch this one again for sure.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Hands down best show I've ever seen. You would not regret the time to watch this series. Well worth the prime membership.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|A Classic movie with the right amount of back story and character development.  Would watch this one again for sure.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was my first experience with the \\"New Adult\\" genre. This book was really refreshing and unexpected. You can tell the plot was very thoroughly planned out down to the last detail. The chapters are set up chronologically by date/time and some jump back into the past; this worked really well for the story. There are some darker themes that the author handled very well. The romance is SO GOOD! If you're wondering about the sexual scenes (let's be real, you are!) one of the \\"kissing\\" scenes is better than most sex scenes I have read, and the rest does not disappoint! I loved the relationship between Sky and Holder, but I wish we would have gotten more from some of the great side characters like Six and Breckin. Overall, I loved this book and I definitely recommend it!<br /><br />If you like Hopeless, I would also recommend [[ASIN:148231312X Going Under]] by S. Walden!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Classic Quentin T movie with the right amount of back story and character development.  Would watch this one again for sure.
160459201X|5.0|Murphy explores the subconscious and the working of the mind. We are a collection of our thoughts. Control them and you find peace
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|A classic movie with the right amount of back story and character development.  Would watch this one again for sure.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Kleon explores the idea that nothing is new, and teaches readers that not only can your &#34;art&#34; coexist with it's predecessors, it can become better for it when you harness the innovation of those who've inspired you. It has many applications, and to me, is a high-brow version of &#34;Who Moved my Cheese?&#34; that  appeals to the creative intellect, while retaining the humor and charm.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|This movie is an amazing tale of small town kids who deals with some adult issues wrapped up in a supernatural adventure. It starts at a funeral which is always intriguing.<br />Its a movie within a movie where one of the boys is creating a student film for a competition with his friends when they witness & accidentally film a very controversial train wreck.<br />While trying to film this adventure over a summer there is fireworks [literally the pyro kid is just obnoxious], first love, tragic  family lose [which personally I never felt was dealt with] alcoholism, neglect and of course military hazmat, swat personnel invading their town. Overall there is much that this movie takes on I just felt that the ending was a bit contrived and not more than a bit saccharin & unsatisfying thus it gets  a four instead of 5.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|See it at the theatre first. Then purchase for one forever. Awesome! Music alone caries it. Acting superb! Life time best.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I was looking for an animal game and i found this one. Its fun taking care of a house but it could use more competitions :l
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show. If you like Sherlock Holmes you'll love this! I can watch it over and over again. The writing is brilliant.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is fun. but now it wont let me play it. I don't know why. I love this game and I wish it would work. Gameloft, you better fix it!!!!!!!!
B00BMEF8UA|5.0|OMFG....Iced Earth has been one of my all-time favorite bands for the last 20+ years and I have had the honor of seeing them live a couple of times during the Matt Barlow era. Fast forward March 2011 along comes new singer Stu Block (ex Into Eternity) to sing on the bands last CD Dystopia which is an awesome CD in it's own right.  So seeing Iced Earth live before I knew what was in store for me...Was I wrong this is the NEW Iced Earth, re-energized re-focused METAL MACHINE..They run through a majority of Iced Earth classics and new songs...The added DVD of the full concert is an added bonus. This is a great pick-up for old and new fans.  Live In Ancient Kourion will be in heavy rotation for a long time. \m/
B005FVNIW6|5.0|Very Good Sci Fi. I would recommend this book to anybody that digs into this genre. Well written and very interesting twist
B003TSEL7S|4.0|This book is great but needs more action<br />This book has lots of errors and need to be fixed before<br /><br />Reproducing
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Heartwarming and heartbreaking..... a glimpse into the depths of our human heart/soul.  The acting is superb & the singing brings the feelings of pain & hurt, joy & love to the forefront.

B009FZHYKU|3.0|I thought Season 3 would begin to pick up the pace, but several episodes just seemed to drag on pointlessly with odd sporadic shifts in character development.<br /><br />The writers went for a few easy, predictable grabs this season. Light on action and loooooong on pointless conversations. Hopefully the writers can re-group and get a handle on the next season and recapture the spark and suspense from season 1.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|If you do not understand the American Political process this movie is a good learning platform.  The issues presented to Lincoln in the mid 1800's are no different those seen today, or that will occur in the future.  The titles of the issues today are money related but the underlying processes that the government runs on are based on the larger group opinion and the underdogs efforts to change the views of the majority.  Lincoln was a very interesting President indeed.  But you have to wonder, are the presidents today the result of money and not character?  I think money rules our governments, not the other way around.  Hence the Federal Reserve.  Americans need to be very afraid of money that runs governments from special interests that never show their faces publicly.  Poisonous times.  Electing politicians for a lifetime of service was not the intent of our founding fathers.  We need term limits to stop the mafias the D's and the R's conduct daily business with.  We need new faces, fresh ideas, we need leaders not puppets.

B006ZAZ31U|2.0|First I must point out that my 2/5-star rating is for the book--not the man whose story it tells.  But regardless of how admirable Adam Brown was for what he overcame and what he achieved, Fearless is a comes across as if specifically for a Christian congregation.  While Brown's military achievements were amazing, really only about half of the book involves them.  The biggest problem with Fearless is that Brown and all the other people in the book come across as a one-dimensional archetypes, devoid of any personality traits other than those to which a good, God-fearing Christian should aspire. Brown is hard working, loyal, and selfless.  Even Brown's struggles with drugs--what should have made him extremely complex--are distilled to a cheap sermon:  once Brown gave himself to Jesus, drugs (mostly) stopped being a problem, freeing him to be an example for the rest of the flcok.  Thus, we never get a real sense of the personal struggle Brown faced.  Another example of the thin character development is Brown's wife.  She is portrayed as stay-at-home mom that keeps the house spotless, her man's happiness the reason for her existence.  The problem is that is ALL she is portrayed as.  Being a great wife and mother is important, of course, but real people have more to them than that.<br /><br />My low rating for this book is not because of its religious message.  My rating is because of the flat character depictions.  (For an example of a good mix of religion and war, I highly recommend [[ASIN:1414320108 Two Wars: One Hero's Fight on Two Fronts--Abroad and Within]] by Nate Self.  It includes the religious/spiritual side of the warrior, using it to fill out the personality, rather than suppress it.)<br /><br />But bottom line, if you are interested in this book for Christian inspiration, you might like it more than me.<br />But if you're looking for military non-fiction that really gets to the personality and experience of military members, and develops the ideas more thana sermon, you may want to avoid.

0385483821|4.0|Below are excerpts from the book that summarize the key points presented by the author:<br /><br />1- \\"Business success contains the seeds of its own destruction. The more successful you are, the more people want a chunk of your business and then another chunk and then another until there is nothing left. I believe that the prime responsibility of a manager is to guard constantly against other people's attacks and to inculcate this guardian attitude in the people under his or her management.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"We all need to expose ourselves to the winds of change. We need to expose ourselves to our customers, both the ones who are staying with us as well as those that we may lose by sticking to the past. We need to expose ourselves to lower-level employees, who, when encouraged, will tell us a lot that we need to know. We must invite comments even from people whose job it is to constantly evaluate us and critique us, such as journalist and members of the financial community. Turn the tables and ask them some questions: about competitors, trends in the industry and what they think we should be most concerned with. As we throw ourselves into raw action, our senses and instincts will rapidly be honed again.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"A strategic inflection point is when the balance of forces shifts from the old structure, from the old ways of doing business and the old ways of competing, to the new. Before the strategic inflection point, the industry simply was more like the old. After it, it is more like the new. It is a point where the curve has subtly but profoundly changed, never to change back again.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"Of all the changes in the forces of competition, the most difficult one to deal with is when one of the forces become so strong that it transforms the very essence of how business is conducted in an industry.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"When an industry goes through a strategic inflection point, the practitioners of the old art may have trouble. On the other hand, the new landscape provides an opportunity for people, some of whom may not even be participants in the industry in question, to join and become part of the action.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"When a strategic infection point sweeps through the industry, the more successful a participant was in the old industry structure, the more threatened it is by change and the more reluctant it is to adapt to it. Second, whereas the cost to enter a given industry in the face of well-entrenched participants can be very high, when the structure breaks, the cost to enter may become trivially small.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"I suspect that the people coming in are probably no better managers or leaders than the people they are replacing. they have only one advantage...the new managers come unencumbered by such emotional involvement and therefore are capable of applying an impersonal logic to the situation.\\"<br /><br />8- \\"As these questions to attempt to distinguish signal from noise: 1) Is your key competitor about to change? 2) Is your key complementor about to change? 3) Do people seem to be \\"losing it\\" around you?\\"<br /><br />9- \\"I call the divergence between actions and statements strategic dissonance. It is one of the surest indications that a company is struggling with a strategic inflection point.\\"<br /><br />10- \\"Ideally, the fear of a new environment sneaking up on us should keep us on our toes. Our sense of urgency should be aided by our judgement, instincts and observations that have been honed by decades spent in the business world. The fact is, because of our experience, very often we managers know that we need to do something. We even know what we should be doing. But we don't trust our instincts or don't act on them early enough to take advantage of the benign business bubble. We must discipline ourselves to overcome our tendency to do too little too late.\\"scape provides an opportunity for people, some of whom may not even be participants in the industry in question, to join and become part of the action.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"When a strategic infection point sweeps through the industry, the more successful a participant was in the old industry structure, the more threatened it is by change and the more reluctant it is to adapt to it.

B008602KQI|4.0|There have been several such, you might say, futuristic type stories that have surfaced over the last couple of years,<br />(&#34;In Time&#34;,  &#34;Equilibium&#34;, &#34;The Island&#34;) that all deal with a similar subject - the dehumanizing of mankind - or more appropriately the attempted dehumanizing of humans really as an &#34;under the carpet&#34; way of supposedly solving the limited resource issue our planet is facing and will be even more so in the not too distant future. Only, as these films portray, limited resources is not at the heart of the problem but greed, coveteousness and lack of care for our fellow mankind...because &#34;there is more than enough to go around&#34; and &#34;no one should have to die for anyone to be immortal&#34;. I suppose we still haven't learned from past history that this is always how man solves their problems - subjugate and then eradicate what encroaches upon you.

The characters are pathetic.  I read the first 5 chapters hoping it was going to get better, then I skimmed the rest of it and quit.  The only thing this book is good for is starting a fire in the fireplace!!!  I am really dissapointed especially since it cost so much!  It's not worth the paper it's written on.  J.K. I want my money back!!!

B001NLKT60|4.0|I read all 3 books and this one is great.  It isn't as slow starting as the first book was. Looking forward to the movie.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|After the amazing first book, I was worried that the second and third installments wouldn't be able to live up to the original's high level of excitement and drama - but both proved to be good tales in their own right. The first sequel, to me, is the weakest part of the tale, but still keeps you interested as you see just how dark the author's world can be. The finale, however, breaks the mold and gives us a decent conclusion while still giving us a lot of what fans of the books loved from parts 1 and 2.<br /><br />Overall, the entire trilogy is a good read and I recommend it.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|The plug and socket on the respective ends of the adapter cable are a good fit with the computer's port and the firewire 800 cable which you want to connect. This is something you need if your computer has Thunderbolt ports and you have Firewire peripherals you need to connect to the computer. I like the fact that there is a flexible cable connecting the two inflexible adapters.

B0047T86G0|5.0|Oxford offer a comprehensive vocabulary with clear definitions. It is very easy to search for words by clicking on the magnifying glass symbol and then typing the word. There are some great appendices for items such as emoticons. Pronounciation symbols could be a little larger, but are given in international phonetic alphabet, which is useful once you get the hang of it. Each definition has an example of how the word can be used in a sentence and also has a short piece on its derivation and origin, which is interesting and informative. This is a great classic English dictionary for those who do not wish to capitulate to the American dictionaries.

B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Everyone remembers the tragic morning of September 11, 2001 when the terrorist attacks occurred. Four airplanes were hi-jacked. The first airplane hi-jacked, American Airlines Flight 11, with passengers aboard, by force hit into the North Tower of The World Trade Center in New York City at 8:46am. 17 minutes later, the second plane, United Airlines Flight 175, hit into the South Tower. Then 34 minutes later, the very low-flying American Airlines Flight 77, hit directly into The Pentagon. Within the next 26 minutes, the fourth hi-jacked airplane, United Airlines Flight 93, had some of the most bravest passengers aboard who were trying to take over the hi-jackers. The passengers sacrificed there lives and had the plane crash in Pennsylvania. The hi-jackers wanted the plane to hit the U.S. Capitol.<br />  A fifth plane they thought was hi-jacked made contact with air-traffic controllers and landed safely in Ohio.<br /><br />The President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, was finally captured December 13, 2003. American soldiers found him in a hole in the ground. The soldiers had passed by the hole with stuff on top of it several times. One soldier went back and removed the stuff over the hole and found Hussein inside alive. He was not shot, but taken into custody. After standing trial, he was put to death December 30, 2006.<br /><br />Osama bin Laden was finally located and under the order of the President of the United States, Barack Hussein Obama, our troops went into this compound and quickly killed him military style, May 2, 2011.

After months of military training, our soldiers were ready and our President of the USA finally gave the word.<br /><br />This movie, Zero Dark Thirty, was put into pre-production and production very quickly as soon as it received the top secret information of what actually happened.

B009VMN3RA|3.0|Sachi Parker wrote this book because she really needed to say some things to her mother who just happens to be Shirley Maclaine.  Instead of sitting down with mom and expressing herself honestly and openly, she wrote a book and, I am sure, made some money.<br />  Now Sachi has a mother who denies most of the incidents in the book and without a doubt is hurt and angry at her daugher..  Fun stuff.<br />  I think Carrie Fisher has more fun writing and I had more fun reading her books.  Not all mothers and daughters get along and this daughter has  written a big wedge between herself and her mother.  Good Luck Sachi

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a great story with great characters. The story starts with the main character in prison, and he was a lawyer. As the story unfolds Grisham takes you on an intriguing adventure with plot twists and turns. As you are trying to figure out what exactly is Max's motive for what he is doing you will not want to put the book (kindle) down. He brings the story to an excellent conclusion that will not disappoint. If you are a fan of Grisham stories this one is a must read!

B000099T3P|3.0|Critters comes on the heels of the more successful Gremlins and Ghoulies. In this feature the little creatures are from outer space. They are a race of aliens known as the Crites. They eat anything, but for some reason they must attack humans. On the heels of the Crites are two aliens who transform their looks into humans, one becoming a famous long hair band singer.<br /><br />The film was a fun knock-off in 1986, but has since become boring and formulaic. It has a decent cast of characters which carried the film. The special alien effects were okay, but the Critters themselves were abysmal, even by 1986 standards. They are not shown a lot. It is an iconic film of the 80's that reads better in the Cliff Notes.<br /><br />Parental Guide: 1 Critter F-bomb subscript, no sex or nudity. Young couple making out in the barn.
B00BMQDM10|3.0|Finished Sophie Kinsella's latest book this morning. I enjoyed it, though perhaps not quite as much as previous books of hers, 'Undomestic Goddess', 'I Got Your Number', and 'Twenties Girl' which is a particular favourite of mine.<br /><br />Kinsella writes believable characters that you hope get their happy ending - its chick lit - it exists as escapist enjoyment for the reader. There is some humour, some drama, people undergoing character transformations, dealing with the past and the strength of family bonds.<br /><br />Minor quibbles - which I probably should blip over, having just said its chick lit, however I was reading at 1am this morning, so might as well write them down. Firstly, a divorcing husband who is causing all kinds of agony on settlement/custody arrangements and then is abruptly sent to California (girlfriend's new job) and so leaves the plot.<br /><br />Plus, its difficult to imagine an energetic seven-year-old child sitting quietly while all the adult dialogue takes place - or at various points the reader is left wondering - who exactly is supervising that child while the adults are talking? At two places in the narrative, the boy is swimming and on both occasions, its not clear to the reader who was keeping an eye on him.<br /><br />Its similar to characters in books rushing off from work unexpectedly to travel or attend weddings - those small details that in real life would be very difficult unless you had an extremely understanding employer and/or were so senior it didn't matter if you just up and leave for the day/week/unspecified amount of time. Or perhaps the character is independently wealthy as to be assured of financial stability, even though they rush off from work.....<br /><br />Overall, fun book but attention to, or explanation of, those small details would have improved it for me.

B004PGO25O|3.0|There are some really good ideas in this book. The idea of &#34;resistance&#34; is very interesting. But much of the actual writing is bad.... like &#34;high school&#34; comp class bad. I can't imagine there was much editing of this book. At least I hope there wasn't.<br /><br />Still, worth the read.
0399157565|5.0|I love all Patricia Cornwell's books, and this one was a great addition to my collection.  I thought the solution to the mystery in this book was a bit abrupt, but it was enjoyable reading.
B004SIP7TE|5.0|I really enjoy this movie.  It has a fine storyline woven from real historical information.  The DVD also has a true historical account of how the Irish were treated upon coming to America and how their gangs evolved and functioned in NY during the time period of America's own Civil War.  The star studded cast is supurb.  Great Flick!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|As usual, a well written  novel with providing insight into the legal system, with a compelling story land a surprise twist at the end..
B00683JLXA|1.0|I couldn't take the annoying sounds it was just terrible. Maybe the 5 star reviews are playing with the sound off. Oh and it has way to many permissions. So good by for ever panda vs ninjas you will never be on one of my phone again
B0086HGW42|5.0|Ed Sheeran is a phenomenal songwriter. From soft acoustic guitar-driven songs to sweeping orchestral pieces with soaring vocals to beat-box-style rapping, this man can do anything. And he does all of it brilliantly. If you've only heard his single &#34;The A-Team,&#34; you're missing out on the truly fantastic songs that make up the rest of the album. It's so cliche to say this, but there really is something for everyone on this album. Sheeran does a little bit of everything on +, but he manages to make every song sound distinctively HIM. I can't recommend it enough.
B008133MDK|5.0|If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes you will find this a great series, even though the original stories are modernized.
B0040I09RM|5.0|a must see show. it will have you at the edge of your seat. once you watch you are hooked
B001N3OJEG|5.0|Really quite an extraordinary film.  Russel Crowe is a standout in an excellent cast.  The story has plenty of twists that keep you riveted from beginning to end but this isn't just the usual boilerplate crime drama or whodunit.  The film explores the different characters' motivations: honor, duty, ambition, revenge, greed, lust and the thirst for power and consequently creates deeply rich characters that we end up understanding and caring about.  A definite must see.
B002RMVAZ8|5.0|A must-see for Shakespeare fans, this production is long (includes every word in the original) but very worthwhile. Kenneth Brannagh's actins is magnificent!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing!!!!!!!Talk about fun and entertaining .It honesty couldn't get any better than this .I would so recommend this app .
B0064MPXFA|1.0|HEAR YE, HEAR YE, HERE COME THE PURVEYORS OF WEASEL GRUEL disguised as lawyers pushing the liberal left agenda. If you were always wondering what the liberal left 's ideology really is but were afraid to ask, this four season &#34;anything goes&#34; (except a belief in Almighty God and  the moral high ground) series is for you.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I'm into my 3rd viewing of the entire series.  Knew I'd love it...and I do!  I would recommend this to anyone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one if those series that grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go. I can already tell that I will be sad when it is over.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This movie was hard to get into but sticking with it was a great experience.  A friend recommended it (a die-hard Denzel fan).  I had to watch it twice because there was so much going on that I felt as though I missed some of it.  I'm glad I did that because there is so much there.  As a Christian, I was intrigued by what being told here.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Enjoyed the series and the cute sayings. Started watching the show with my daughter and made both seasons a rainy day couch time day. Loved the time spending with her and she shows were pretty light hearted and funny.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I was a little let down by this movie after all the hype.  I am a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and this story was not the Segway that I had hoped.  Still was very well done, a good story and did give some hints of what was to unfold in the trilogy. Ian McKellen is super. It was &#34;an unexpected journey&#34;, but a delightful one.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I've beaten Shadow of the Colossus on the ps2 countless times and have played a small amount of ICO also on ps2, so I mainly got this to play ICO on my ps3 and it looks fantastic and is still as fun. I've also beaten SotC again and it looks even better than the beauty on the ps2. These are two fantastic games that I'd recommend to anyone who is a fan of adventure/puzzle games that look gorgeous.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a great game very hard and super fun. not too bard though I like ut a lot its great
B009MCRHH6|3.0|I've played the pc version and all I really have to say is that I prefer to use the mouse to play this game over my finger on a touch screen. Other than that, this is a solid puzzle game with a good sense of humor
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book series! I fear that the 3rd book will not be done justice with the movie. It will be too censored!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Good to pass time with, in short bursts. Sorta like a 3D majong. You match up 2 of the same block then they go away, do so until the cube is gone and then do it faster. There isn't much to this game but it can be fun to pass time with.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|This book made me want to a member of the book club. The characters evolved I such a way they became real. I felt I knew them all so well. Sorry when I came to the end.
1608862801|4.0|I'm not really big on comics and only recently started reading some, this, ragman, and my little pony to name a few. I really like how its short adventures just like in the show. The stories, characters, and jokes are all funny and charming and I have no complaints. I'd probably rather just watch the show though.
0345529057|5.0|I'd like to say this product came in brand new in the wrap and everything. I saw the same books in a book store where I currently stay and ordering via amazon was much cheaper including the delivery option I selected. I started watching the series first, shame to say I'm gonna be delving into the books a little too 'late'. All in all, pretty good job Amazon and the delivery company i-parcel. This customer is satisfied.<br /><br />PS: I think you have to have a vast imagination in order to enjoy books like this ;)
B000PC0SPU|5.0|Great book on mind. Every one of young generation should read this. There is wealth of information here. I am looking forward to his next book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played.If u get this game u will be gad as ever because I know I would.I love minecraft so much I have it on xbox and kindle
B002VPE1B6|5.0|product was in good condition as describe, worth for the money i spent. i would consider buying more in the future.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This was a great movie.  My daughter loved it, and so did I.  This was my daughter's second time watching it, and my first.  The acting, story, and animation are all very good.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Saw her on MTV and bought the album on a whim.  She is great and the album is one of the best I've purchased in a while.  Every song  is good in my opinion.  She is going to be a star or already is.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I gave this to my 12 year old son for his birthday and he has really enjoyed creating with it.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|Running the mobile version of the Amazon page is, overall, a far more useful approach. I tried the app because Prime one-click is buggy on the mobile site.<br />Since I can't find a way to filter or fine tune the app search I guess I'm stuck with both for now.<br />What's the use of having prime if I can't isolate prime deals? Only seems useful once you know exactly whatyou want.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I can't upload my pictures on the Facebook . I need get something to get my pictures on the Facebook platform for background on my profile .. please update the Facebook platform for the profiles of Facebook
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Can't seem to get enough of this classic. A little different than the broadway production in that it's actors doing the singing rather than singers doing the acting.  A commendable performance, especially by Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Filled with technical information & ninja rigging know how, but cut with witty, often sarcastic humor.  I read a lot of books, this is one of the best I've ever read.  Not your typical sci-fi story.  I had a hard time putting it down.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This show with its strong and classy characters and storyline in the early 20th century setting is an absolute must see!!
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|This product works ok but froze up my system more than once when trying to use it. Give it a try but don't be surprised if it slows you down.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|With the passage of time the show evolves and when you watch it it feels like we become part of the story
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator has a lot of features! Works great for what I use it for and the buttons are easy to see even in the dimmest lighted setting on your kindle fire HD! Would recommend to anyone who wants a basic + calculator! I really love the fact that you can switch between two layouts. There may be more but that is all I wanted at the time! Play around with it you won't be disappointed!
B009EEFTMC|2.0|It is just an okay game.  Didn't pull me in like Words with Friends or Zombies.  Already off my device.
B00C8ULNVK|5.0|After releasing two successful singles, Carlos Vives comes out with a very solid album.<br /><br />Even though the two singles are still, in my opinion, better than the other songs in the album, you must still get this!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I really do not like any game that requires purchases to fully enjoy the game.  I know many ways to spend my money this is not one
B00C32R64G|5.0|This CD ROCKS and the hard hitting sounds just keep coming from this band. This is a must have in your music collection. Just Awesome..
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook is great for many people but some of us just don't get it.  I especially don't like so many games that require you to spend money to enjoy the games.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie is like being hit by a tornado, the happy way. Think of the old west running into Reservoir Dogs, or the Antebellum south running into Jackie Brown. If you are a Quentin Tarantino fan, you will be pleased. In this movie he delivers what he has held the promise of becoming, a perennial master of the action flick, the blood, the gore, the humor and the fun. He takes you and he punches you, he kicks you and he all around kicks your ass and you can't be happier. This is the revenge movie you wanted to see with Inglorious Bastards. The language is dirty, the characters are even more dirty and the movie has all forms of low, down dirty. Fun, fun, fun. The bounty hunter German steals the show. Enjoy.......
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a great book full of helpful information that dispels important misconceptions about fitness. I definitely learned a lot and it's great to know that cheat meals are not the end of the world! I've already recommended it to all my friends and they are going to buy the book.<br /><br />Just a quick question. Sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night, around 3:00 to 4:00am and feel hungry. Is it a bad idea to eat breakfast at that time, then go back to sleep only wake up several hours later and eat another round of breakfast to start the day? So like, I'm eating a double breakfast. What do you think about that?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just wish I could pick a Clydesdale like my horse. And I could get more diamonds without having to pay for them. My son and I just love this game
0765325950|5.0|This is the book I've been waiting for ever since beginning the Wheel of Time series in the mid-90s.  I wasn't disappointed either.  Well written, with many twists and turns, I thoroughly enjoyed it until the very last page.  Special thanks for Brandon Sanderson for finishing it with a bang, and most especially to Robert Jordan, for planting a seed within me that I've nourished these many years.  You are gone, but never forgotten.<br /><br />MR
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|This item shipped fast and guess what? The blu ray in the container was exactly as described. It was of the movie Ponyo. Go figure. My son loves this. I am usually a man of a few words but the only reason i am babbling is because when reviewing products, Amazon will not allow me to submit areview if it lacks a certain number of words. Oh, I finally reached the minimum. Good bye!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|At times this book was difficult to read and nearly as difficult to put down.  It's a raw slap of the reality of slavery when perfectly nice white people acted shamefully.  Great read!  J Rose
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|don't waste your time downloading it!!!! It told me the password to my Wi-Fi password was bunnies!wtf my password was longer and had numbers&letters
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Of the dozen or so books read since january, this is definitely my favorite.  Victoria was the most multifaceted lead woman in a book I've read recently.  I loved her, I loved Elizabeth and you gotta love Ruby.<br />This book was gripping and left such a feeling of hope in my heart.  Julie Rose
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT is cool but it has chunks.  I can't go where they are so I think they should be removed.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|She brings this time period life with the sweet/sad story of James and Lydia. I love stories of Ireland and this is a good one.
0399213015|3.0|We lost this book during the move and my grandchildren love this book. I didn't realize it was a miniature book, so I and they were disappointed. Love the story of the book itself and will order full size one. Thank you
1607066017|5.0|Brian K. Vaughan has created a world unlike any other. Not since the first time I watched the original Star Wars trilogy have I felt so absorbed by a fictional universe. The worlds are mysterious and full of culture that is just waiting to be discussed and discovered in further volumes. Every character in this story is so flawed and imperfect that it's safe to say morality covers various shades of grey in Saga.<br /><br />The storyline is gripping, filled with brutal encounters and character building moments that I will likely be ingrained in my memory for quite a while. Along with that, the art is very good and colorful. Having a physical copy of the story make the experience even better as the paperback volume was (as expected) in great condition and quality.<br /><br />If you're tired of seeing Hollywood and novelists wring out the same bland characters and settings each year, I'd give Saga a go. Definitely not a comic series for children to read, but for adults it is a great piece of literature.<br /><br />I know I'm not alone when I say I can't wait for the second volume to be published.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a really nice app.  You have the calculation history, which is a plus.  The only thing this app is missing that the real thing has, is the paper tape! ;-)
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Hilarious read. A little slow at times, but overall I loved it!<br />Tina Fey made you feel a part of her world and made me realize things about her life I never knew.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Do not watch these movies on tv speakers! to fully enjoy these movies get your self a 5.1 surround system to fully enjoy the sound on these blurays. All three movies are great but the sound is what i buy blurays for and these movies do not disappoint!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite app of all time! :) It's addictive and awesome!I recommend this to everyone that enjoys games like temple run.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|i love this game but after a while everytime i tried to get on it went straight home!it also glitches on me so i would buy the game if it didnt hav these glitches
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  I like magic the gathering and this game is very similar to it and very enjoyable and easy to get in too.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|One of the best action adventure books I've read. I would rate this book five stars but I didn't understand one part of it.
B000TO0TB2|4.0|Three well written stories that somewhat tie together. The story lines are clever though depressing. But it's definitely a good read.
B00683JLXA|1.0|I didn't even bother downloading it after watching the preview video.  this game is obviously a rip off off of angry birds.  I mean come on exploding pandas speedy pandas.  do not download
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Narrator is showns a rabbit hole in Maine in 2011 that transports him to 1958.  The way he handles this is a very intriguing concept.. It's somewhat like two books in one.
0788750097|5.0|The sound of the tapes are clear.  The clamshell case was very clean.  I am just happy.  I may  record the tapes on to CD's so I won't have to worry about the tapes breaking or getting tangled in my tape player.
B004QZ9P6K|4.0|Very interesting thesis. Discusses examples a d reason why Israel has had tons of new businesses and creative ideas in tech, biotech, environmental, etc  Large part due to mandatory military service, bonding relationships, training the brightest at an early age and attitude
B0010X745K|4.0|Classic Stephen King work.  I like this movie. King always finds some weird story to tell and keep you watching.
B00ARAO720|3.0|The first time I watched this at the theater I really liked it.  The second time - on the tv screen - it didn't make quite the impact.  I used to ride my bike a lot (never like this!) and I couldn't understand why drivers hate bicyclists.  Now I know.
B00B125QRS|5.0|This box set is worth buying if you are a pureist when it comes to van Helen with David Lee Roth then this is a must have. The sound quality is incredible each CD sounds like it was recorded in 2013 from Van Halen 1 to 1984 there is no background hiss or feedback what so ever so to sum it up this is a quality deal worth your money the packaging is nice to each CD has the original artwork.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites. Having served in the military I truly appreciate a movie that honors the service of our warriors.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|I barely watched Speed Racer as a kid so I didn't know what to expect when I watched this. I was pleasantly surprised. I love a good family friendly movie where the hero fights against an unjust system. I loved the cinematography of the movie. It seemed to hold true to what I know if the cartoon and you just don't see movies made like that very often.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend touches a place in the heart where Curtis Mayfield, Donny Hathaway, Jerry Butler, Johnny Taylor, Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye and Jackie Wilson used to touch. He has that old school soulful sound. John Legend is Brand Grand. He is blessed just blessed abundantly. I Love his commitment to his music. That's not the easiest thing to do.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|You just can't stop listening to it! The songs don't get old at all. Love how he's made each song unique and how the rhythm changes.
B003L77GRO|1.0|I ordered this DVD three weeks ago.  They cheerfully took my money.  Now, three weeks later, I have no product, I have no refund, I have nothing.<br /><br />When you make a purchase online, you put your trust and belief in a system that you have no assurances will work.  It doesn't always.  Amazon charges heavy shipping fees if you want a quick turnaround.  And when you order online you want your product yesterday.  Often you order online because you can't find something locally.<br /><br />eBay and other online retailers ship items much faster and much more cheaply and they do NOT tolerate fraud.  I have nothing from Scott's Mint DVD's'  Nothing.  For my stress I should receive a new copy of my order from Amazon.  Want to bet that will happen?<br /><br />I am becoming much more fed up with just trying to deal with Amazon.  They arrange for cheaper prices through outside vendors because their own are often too high to buy direct from Amazon,  Then they give unreasonable windows for shipment to occur, so you're waiting forever and then you cases like mine, where that vendor never even ships your order.  Amazon doesn't seem to control them ... and with a gazillion customers just like me, I guess they don't have to.<br /><br />I will be reluctant to part with my money for a long time.  And may only use entities like PayPal in the future.  This all SUCKS!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|You are a TOY!! You are a child's play thing!! You're a sad strange little man!<br /><br />That's not flying, that's falling with style.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Very technical but this is Sci Fi and fits well in this thriller. The author has a keen knowledge Of the sciences. Whether or not the information was accurate really did not matter. A very good read which kept me on the edge of my seat.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Very well written & a very different perspective.  Plot twists and turns were interesting and held my interest.  Would recommend.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie!!! I am looking forward to watching the next Hunger Games Movie, Catching Fire I believe it is called!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love the show, very entertaining. Cant wait for season four. please let me no when it is on amazon so that I can get it. :)
B004NELBPC|1.0|I deleted the app after the update. why the change?  I'll find something else, even if not free. It used to have the loook and feel of a newspaper.  Now it is more like a tabloid.
B008602KQI|4.0|Mostly believable story. Played very well. Did a god job capturing the action with camera angles. Would recomend to anyone above 16.
B00821PCJS|5.0|My wife and 2 kids 16yo and 11yo watch one episode of this a few nights a week and it's pretty good.  For Her it's got a great story line and character development to make it interesting. For Him it's got enough aliens and &#34;dispensing justice&#34; to keep me interested. my kids like it as well. I'd recommend it.  We also liked the series Jericho a few years ago.<br /><br />Tractor on,<br />Phill
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this game it is so great. I have always loved cut the rope but this is harder and has more to each level and time that you travel to in this game. You go to multiple places and it adds something new each time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great season of interwoven stories. The second season is as wonderful as first, I can't wait to see Season 3.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Great chapter! Makes you understand a little more about dexters behavior! It makes a pretty good summary of the whole season
086571701X|4.0|Easy to read and very informative. Unfortunately, blows by some of the mechanical references with just a mention. This book is a must have in your collection of guides for aquaponics.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a true &#34;I couldn't put it down&#34; thriller with an ending I didn't see coming! I didn't want it to end!
0425220931|3.0|I would have preferred a more explicit description of how music has influenced Wooten's entire being rather the dialogue with the mystical stranger.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is written so well! Full of drama, and  very descriptive hot sex!!!!<br />I am in love with the book! The story really pulls you in instantly!
1476712042|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book! was addicted since the start! I even finished it in 3 days! (lol I couldn't help it!) I love the romance (yes, even the DETAILS of their romance), drama and everything in between, I got to say I was a little mad at Abby for breaking Travis' heart but was happy about the ending and now I can't wait to read the next one! Thanx Jamie McGuire.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The show is great.  My comment here relates to the question of whether to purchase the streaming version or the DVD version.  Unless you can stream directly through your television and are sure that you will never want to watch at another location that doesn't have such access or loan to friends/family that doesn't, purchase the DVD version.  I streamed it for $15, but could have paid just $5 more to own the DVDs.  I wish I had spent the extra $5.  My family wanted to borrow, but they don't own a television with internet capability, nor could they ever imagine watching t.v. on a computer.  Similarly, I wanted to watch with a friend, but it wasn't practical to huddle around the computer.
0756655730|5.0|very well put together , very good for the laymen. logical approach to the subjact,diagrams and pictures appropriate.glad I bought it.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Quentin Tarantino became famous with his high concept modern adventure movies. They have succeeded largely because they had these huge infusions of style in most improbable ways. They have many fantasy elements intermixed with what purports to be naturalistic dialog. For example in Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction the story is broken up into chapters each of which has a mini-title sequence and then these chapters are presented out of order. In Kill Bill he has a whole chapter presented as a Japanese style cartoon. The killers in Pulp Fiction discuss hamburgers in a realistic manner but then behave like comic book superheroes. This juxtaposition of the banal with the extraordinary  is a shock to the audience. This style is what made Tarantino famous.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino heretofore has always made contemporary films aimed at pure entertainment. Django is a sharp break from that practice. It is a pseudo historical film based as it says - 'two years before the Civil War'. Of course 1858 was three years before the Civil War not two. I expect that gratuitous error is just another stylistic element rather like false history in Inglourious Basterds. In both of these films Tarantino introduces a wildly improbable and totally despicable set of villains so as to justify his hero's elaborate and graphic revenge. In Basterds the monsters are German Nazis. In Django they are white Americans.<br /><br />Django is a kind of spaghetti Western in the same sense that Kill Bill was a kind of of Samurai movie. The original Django as played by Franco Nero was a kind of poor man's Clint Eastwood and the 'Man with No Name'. But there are some major differences. Previously Tarantino made amoral action movies. Pulp Fiction for example has no message. It introduces drugs, contract killings, sado-masochism and organized crime but only to shock and delight the audience. It does not try to make a moral statement about the morality of taking drugs and killing people. Those outrageous actions are presented in a straight forward factual manner. Tarantino does not preach. His style is 'cool'.<br /><br />But in Django he adopts a hotter style and a more distant view point. Tarantino tries very hard to enlist us the audience to hate white Southerners. Django is filled with material that strives to make a political-moral point. It is very, very preachy. He becomes rather like older Hollywood directors Stanley Kramer or Norman Jewson who made screen dramas with strong civil rights messages. Those earlier movies always starred Sidney Poitier as a sympathetic and noble black man. The whites were typically slack jawed and slovenly cretins. Jaime Foxx is not elegant like Poitier or even sympathetic. He is continuously surly. Tarantino has to work hard to get the audience to accept such an ugly, nasty character as a hero. He does this by portraying almost all the whites in the movie as degenerate monsters. Whites spend all of their time whipping or torturing the black slaves. This sets up the scenes where Django can be seen as justified for killing whites.<br /><br />Tarantino wanted to make a moralistic civil rights type movie. He put it in a spaghetti Western wrapper and set in in the distant past. This later choice was crucial. Modern audiences especially modern white audiences are familiar with modern black behavior and the black condition. Modern day blacks are not very sympathetic. The public perception is that they rape, rob, and murder while collecting welfare and food stamps. When Tarantino presented Ving Rhames in Pulp Fiction he was shown as a rich mob boss. He sends out his minions to exact revenge on his enemies. Not a nice guy. Such a black character won't do in a civil rights type movie. Civil rights themed movies are always set in the past.<br /><br />So Tarantino had to set the action in the distant past. Many conventional modern civil rights movies like Mississippi Burning also avoid a contemporary plot line because the modern black man is just notsympathetic. They set their stories back in the 1950s or 1960s when every right thinking white person knew that black people were blameless victims. Tarantino takes that one step further. Tarantino takes us back to the slavery period in his quest to find a sympathetic black man.<br /><br />The problem is that Tarantino is not well equipped for period pictures. Tarantino's best movies have many 'over the top' scenes. The sword fighting sequences in Kill Bill and the gangster sequences in Pulp Fiction are not in any way realistic. They are fantasies. We recognize this and accept it - its fun. The Nazi hunters in his only other historical movie 'Inglourious Basterds' are also wild crazy caricatures. The audience is quite familiar with WWII events and stories. We get it. But in a story set before the Civil War we get confused. Are these insanely blood thirsty white people meant to be real? Or are they just fantasy extrapolations like the bizarre Kill Bill assassins?<br /><br />Tarantino emerged as a maker of 'new' movies. He uses lots of older material like obscure pop music but his purpose has always been to show the paying customers something new. He reverses himself with Django. This is an old fashion preachy civil rights movie told with new elements. About the only really entertaining theme in the film is that of the bounty hunter. We have seen bounty hunters before but never one like this. Before the hunter was a tall, taciturn, loner who tracked down the bad guys in the wilderness. Waltz is a short, old, garrulous social gad fly. He tricks the men he hunts and kills them in cold blood. He does this in public and then produces a paper that shows his authority to kill. It's a clever plot device and as far as I know completely original.<br /><br />Waltz is best known as a movie Nazi, and he is a kind of Nazi here. He speaks German and he kills efficiently. His purpose in the film seems to be to show that regular white Americans are worse yet.<br /><br />We know now that about 25% of cowboys in the American West were black. Many conventional Westerns have shown us black cowboys for  decades. Yet in Django Unchained everyone is amazed to see a black man on a horse. Some try to shoot him for being uppity. Why interject such a stupid and incongruous element? It doesn't seem to be just characteristic Tarantino hyperbole done for stylistic purposes. It seems like a true blunder. Tarantino's famous Hollywood trivia scholarship for once has betrayed him.<br /><br />The whole plot is a set up for the last half hour in which Django kills lots and lots of white people. This is reminiscent of Kill Bill I in which Kiddo chops up about a hundred Yakuza single handedly. That was an 'over the top' homage to various low budget Samurai movies. Django's killing spree looks like many another spaghetti western except for the blood. Django is a lightning fast pistollero - although how he acquired that much skill that quickly is not very well explained. We can accept that this former field hand is now a world class gunman as necessary to the story. The more bizarre part is the blood.<br /><br />Oddly enough all that spurting blood comes from Samurai movies. Kurosawa made a blood machine for the climax of his great Samurai movie \\"Sanjuro\\". Mifune cuts through Nadakai's torso in the final duel. Then the blood machine malfunctioned. Instead of a pouring out of blood when the abdominal aorta was cut, the damn thing gave this huge blood explosion, as if a high pressure hose had been severed. The special effects  technician apologized and started to set it up again, when Kurosawa said, no he liked it, leave it in. Sam Peckinpaw saw Sanjuro and loved the effect. In the final reels of \\"The Wild Bunch\\" all the Mexicans when hit by a bullet explode in blood as if they are not solid people at all, but very taut high pressure blood balloons. Tarantino continues that practice. Quite silly but that's Hollywood. It's a loony convention now.<br /><br />The blood convention joins the revenge convention. Django is a very conventional movie. You can see the plot twists coming from far off. No shocks or surprises here.<br /><br />In making a civil rights parable Tarantino has become a much more conventional and much less interesting director.that about 25% of cowboys in the American West were black.

B00821BLX4|4.0|This ring mounts both 40.5mm filters and accessory lens.  I had some Zeikos 52mm 2x telephoto attachments that fit on the adapter (using 40.5 to 46 and 46 to 52mm ring adaptors) with no instability due to the added weight.  You do have to zoom in a little or your picture will vignette.  Minus one star for being cheap plastic.
0736092269|5.0|I always struggled to lose weight, but then a co-worker told me to try this book, and it gave me structure in losing weight and toning up.  I take it to the gym every time I go.  People sometimes look at me strange at the Gym, but I've lost 100 pounds using this book to help me structure my work out, so I don't care if people look at me strange at the gym.  The book is mainly photos, but just use it to see how to use the weights, then follow the book one page at a time until you start getting results.
0345803507|5.0|Can't wait for your trilogy to come to life! May I please suggest the following actors to play the lead roles:<br />* Christian - Chris Hensworth (Thor)<br />* Anastacia - Kirsten Stewart (Twightlight)<br /><br />I love the innocence of Kirsten & Chris is what I envision Christian to look like (besides being handsome is the arrogance, physique, sensuality & virility). Hope you could consider these recommendations for your movie that my friends & I look forward to.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I just started reading Brandon Sanderson's works recently, and like many of his other works this is a very exciting read. It captivates and keeps my attention, and there is never a dull moment. The only real regret is having to read it before the series was finished. I just wanted to read more.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love the versitility of this app. you can change tone mix sounds and much more. plus the sounds are mostly all free.
0385474547|4.0|Certainly this book reflects the effect of colonialism on foreign countries. Horrible things were done to cultures as countries such as England, a noted colonialist, changed the face of culture. There were gains but also concomitant losses that were irreversible within native races. Who knows where these cultures would have gone without out interference? I did find that almost all of the NIgerian people I work with read this book in high school. The minute I mentioned the name of the book or the author they responded immediately. His book had great impact.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Now I can't stop quoting it to my friends and sharing my thoughts on each and every one topic raised. I was never afraid to admit being a feminist, but after reading this book I became truly proud of it. Hope 'Lean In' will soon be translated to Russian and more people in my country get a chance to read it.
0345803507|5.0|This started out as shocking but in the end it was just a love story. I eventually tired of the lovemaking and wanted to concentrate on the story. The most memorable thing for me was when she was in labor and they decided to do a C-section. As her husband walked away Anastasia said &#34;Christian.&#34; That expressed the rare beauty of their love. It is what people long for. Sex ix great but it is love that lights up your married life.
B002BCNK1Q|2.0|This is a really dumb movie, but then you probably weren't expecting Goddard when you rented it. Of note, however, is the terrible acting. The you man who plays the priest in this film is one of the worst actors I have seen in years in any kind of film, corporate, independent or otherwise.<br /><br />Ironically, Eastwood's comment on racism in our society is in itself racist. This guy (a big dummy) obviously has no empathy for other cultures and it shows.<br /><br />Avoid.

B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the story......it was awesome seeing the book made into a movie.  Can't wait for the next ones to come out

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Wonderful story line and the action scenes are great.  Love historiy and this movie, though not historically acurate, brought the past to real life.

B002W1UEW4|5.0|I loved the action and story line of this movie.  Kept my attention through the whole thing.  Want to see more.
0802473156|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, it provided an insight into us as people and what it is that we want from our spouse or partner.  I found that it gave me some avenues to take in getting the type of love that makes me happy and feel loved. I would recommend this book to every one because it speaks on so many levels. Again, it was a great read, loved it
B00A83075M|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much - took me back to all the games I used to play and loved the hidden gems in this movie.  Very good movie from start to finish and would strongly recommend.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|Very romantic movie watched it twice would recommend it to anyone who likes these types of movies or even if you don't!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I really haven't had an opportunity to use my kindle app, but I have had to reload it on my phone after only having it for 2 months...to be determined
B00BCOGM78|4.0|This is a great album, but it doesn't feel quite \\"like\\" Clutch without the blues influences.  I still prefer \\"From Beale St. To Oblivion\\" and \\"Robot Hive Exodus\\" over this most recent offering.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|good batteries..cheap price..fast shipper..convenience of not hunting for them in the store..i like the deal I got...no complaints on my part
1419701533|5.0|My 2nd grade grandson asked me to purchase these books from the school scholastic book club.  I checked on Amazon and found them cheaper, and purchased.  I can't comment on content, but I can tell you the next weekend my grandson came to visit he brought the books and focused on reading, instead of video games.  It's been 4 weeks and he's read 3 of the 5 ...  cover to cover!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a really fun game for your kids to play or for you to play. you should always regimens this game to all the kids.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved everything about this storyline. well written and touching. A girlfriend recommended it and I couldn't agree more. Not your typical love story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|we love this app.  my three year old played it the whole drive from pa to Maine.<br />we really enjoy it a lot.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Interesting. Typical King.  I enjoyed it very much  .  Enjoyed it even more on my new kindle  and now I'm going to download another.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Just started playing this game and it's pretty entertaining! Haven't gotten bored yet, there's always something to do to earn more coins, XP, etc.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Like Bob Dylan but can sing and plays more chords then just C and G. Some deep lyrics. Love this album!
B001VIMCW4|5.0|I love James Bond, I just bought for me the entire collection. This is another great movie with Daniel Craig!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's really cool the only bad thing is you don't get to pick any name for your horse that really sucks but other than that it's cool
0545265355|5.0|This is a great young adult (and adult) trilogy. There is some topics that are not appropriate for elementary school children (under 5th grade level, at least). Overall, as an adult, I really enjoyed the suspense, action, love stories, etc.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|The title says it all. Stop reading reviews and buy this book, read this book, and apply what you've learned.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Love it amazing creativity and romance. I would if gave it a 5 but the ebook version has a lot of errors.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I have just about every commercially available recording from Boz Scaggs.  This is a wonderful collection of original creations and classic (but maybe obscure) soul gems.  If you ever heard his live performance of \\"Drowning in the Sea of Love\\" on 1992's New York Roll and Soul Review, you will love this.  Boz's interpretation of Steely Dan's \\"Pearl of the Quarter\\" is inspired.<br />If you haven't stayed current with Mr. Scaggs, check out his \\"Fade Into Light\\" - it was released on 9/11/2001 - it is magnificent.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not a big SciFi reader though I enjoy the really clever ones (Ender's Game, for example), which this is. This author is good at telling a rather simple story with enough implied complexity for the reader to build a vision of the challenges and horrors that are involved with living and sustaining life in the silo. As depressing as the tale gets, there remains enough hope to keep the reader going. Elegant writers know what to leave out and Howey does it well.  I'm looking forward to the last installment & the movie adaptation.<br /><br />Because it's also a series of novellas I found it to be perfect for the busy person to read in small bits.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome game. my sister and I are having fun playing it. I like Temple Run 2 better than the first one!!
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|The movie is great, see it you have not! The service was on point, but I don`t give five stars as nothing is perfect but this is close. The price made the decision to buy easy.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Great film.  I would recommend it to anyone.  A wonderful commentary on the meaning of friendship and misunderstanding of disability.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I literally couldn't put this book down, I even read it while getting ready for work. I loved the characters despite their insane ways. There is a good bit of language so it may not be for those who are bothered it. Otherwise, buy this book, you won't be disappointed.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|So many emotions go through your mind as you read this book. Sorrow, grief, happiness, etc. It sucks you in.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book shows you life happens and no matter what you have to roll with it. Live your life with no regrets.
B003CI90MQ|5.0|Despite being written with a great sense of humor, this book is for photographers and enthusiasts who want to get serious about digital photography. It sports a brilliant narrative that keeps you hooked up for the next photography tip and its simple structure makes it really easy to understand. Highly recommended.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|love the music - violin + dubstep = amazing<br /><br />expecting great things from Lindsey Stirling - I think this is the beginning of an amazing career
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome! Best season yet!! Did not want to wait until this fall to catch up with it on AMC. Amazon Instant Video was super easy to use!
B00B23O96A|2.0|not satisfied - very disappointed in the cd/music.  not the eric Clapton I know and love.  not a happy camper.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great so keep in touch with friends? Just don't mind if strangers look at it too. It depends on you.
B005CKPQ7A|4.0|Nothing better. Shot in Albuquerque too. Acting is first class. Too bad they cancelled after season 5. I would have continued watching!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|It is confusing as to what actually happened. My wife read it twice and still was puzzled. Ang Lee's take was very enjoyable. I like to think that Pi was telling it like it was for the most part. A truly unusual adventure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so addicting I started playing it at about 3pm totally zoned in to it and started beating everyone of my friends and by the time I stopped playing it was well after midnight
0375842209|5.0|I've read many books by and about Jewish survivors from Germany and elsewhere.  This is the first book I've read (and I'm not a voracious reader) about a person growing up in Nazi Germany.  An excellent read.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Quintessential 80's movie with all the Spielberg influence you can handle.  Must see for any budding teen; Or, adult who loves a great adventure. Doesn't get too much better than this.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|Great plots, fantastic characters and sets, imaginative writing and excellent acting.  Proceed with caution ... highly addictive!  In three words ... do it now!  You will not be disappointed, especially if you already read the books.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a very fun game to play. Had a lot of things to do. Hidden object games, mixed .with collecting inventory items to use later to mini puzzles. Plenty of hints which I need
B0026ISUUQ|2.0|Simplistic politics combined with an overworked plot leads to the inevitable heart wrenching tragedy. Corporate greed leads to murder, cribbing strudy results and big bucks for multinational drug companies. No mention, of course, that these same type of companies have turned AIDs into a chronic and perhaps curable disease, etc
055357342X|5.0|Storm of Swords satisfies both sexes. It is simultaneous swashbuckling and runs the gamut of human emotions... and more than a handful of things you never thought would happen. Martin is a wonderful author and we are privileged to be able to choose him. If you're wondering whether to continue with the series, don't think about it. JUST DO IT!

B005Q1W10A|5.0|In a day and age when quality TV is hard to find, you need look no further than PBS.  The English consistently offer it in both drama and comedy. Downton is well acted, and kindly shows human imperfection; there's something to like with both heroes and villains. It is well worth your investment of time and money.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I was really let down by the ending. I don't think it really completes the story. It was great, but really I felt like it wasn't finished.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I enjoyed this trilogy, it was indeed a wonderful ready. Grey and Ana were made for each other, they took out the best of each other
B00957T6X6|4.0|Written Very engaging Makes It Hard To Put Down MaRtin Is A Very Descriptive Writer, In Some Cases Maybe A Little Too. But Very Good Book Series
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|need money to do a lot. which you have to actually buy from amazon. and some of the things take almost a week to finish. which is kind of annoying
B0006Z2KXE|4.0|I was really very surprised to see how seriously this witty bit of comedy was taken, and how many people were offended by the fact that a). the story is about an upper class Philadephia \\"Mainline\\" family; and b). Hepburn was shoved to the ground by Cary Grant in the opening of the film. (One gets the impression that an evening spent with such reviewers, as one commentator said about the Rev. and Mrs. Bertram in Mansfield Park, would be heavy going.) Why not just consider it a period film about a class that no longer exists? (And Hepburn was not struck, she was pushed; I've seen more violence in children's television commercials.)<br /><br />Given the more limited vocabularies and attention spans of many viewers today, I suppose that such a movie being seen as boring was almost inevitable, despite its being full of funny one-liners and bon mots. Moreover, few modern critics seem to have picked up on the main theme of the film: To reveal the \\"human\\" side of the upper class, and the \\"noble\\" side of the struggling working class (though Jimmy Stewart's character did go to college)--and thereby have them interact and understand each other better.<br /><br />An important point to remember is that Tracy Lord's family was \\"Mainline\\": one of the original founders of Philadelphia--a city which was still proud of its Quaker heretage (which can be seen when Jimmy Stewart and the librarian have that hilarious exchange using \\"thee\\", \\"thou\\", \\"thy,\\" etc.)--and which is why Tracy sometimes seemed so \\"preachy\\". America was also much more class conscious then: Even when many were still dealing with the Great Depression(\\"Belts will be worn tighter this year\\"), ladies wore hats when outside and inside, except in their own office or home; and even struggling Jimmy Stewart could pack a tuxedo in his suitcase (black tie rather than white tie but still formal wear).<br /><br />When the movie was produced in 1939, people would have understood that background; and in today's age of populism, it is hardly surprising that some people cannot grasp why gossip sheets and magazines would carry stories about \\"Mainline\\" wealthy families--except that it provided escapism, and even a tiny ray of hope: No one would have been really surprised if Kathrine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart, or Cary Grant and Ruth Hussey had become couples, despite their class differences; in fact, that possibilty provides tension within the plot itself. (Indeed, Ruth Hussey came very close to upstaging Hepburn herself in her witty observations and insights, and portrayed a warmer, more sympathetic character, in spite of her sarcasm.)<br /><br />Yet for all this more serious undertone, The Philadelphia Story is first and foremost a comedy; not the slip-on-the-banana-peel sort, but more of the witty, Brit-com type, similar to \\"As Time Goes By\\" with Judy Dench and Geoffrey Palmer; of course, there are people who think those are boring too--which also is a sad pity.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Great kids movie - a little scary in some parts so if you have a child under 4 you might want to pass or be prepared to cover eyes, answer questions or be up at night :) Other than that my son loved it and I found myself liking it as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good choice of game for all I recommend because it does not require on line and not worried on the graphics
B003HV0TN2|5.0|I am 37. I have been reading fantasy (among other) books since I was in my teens. The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear are among the very best I have ever read - on par with the likes of The Lord of the Rings / Tolkein.<br /><br />I can't understand why anyone would be disappointed enough to give this one star - and comparing it to The Wheel of Time... Please. WOT was pretty average.<br /><br />The thoughtfulness of plot development and, especially for me, the superb quality of writing, is what sets these books apart.<br /><br />I have recommended these books to a dozen friends of all walks of life and they have all loved them.<br /><br />Very well crafted. A very enjoyable read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My child loves this, and I find it rather addicting too.  It is a little laggy, but it is worth it.
B00519YRH2|3.0|A fun and easy movie to watch. It reminds us of the importance of being a kid. I also enjoyed watching Tom Hanks at a very young age. A great actor, for sure
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|This was a fantastic book. I was enthralled all the way through. I felt as if I were actually part of the action. The characters were all drawn so vividly.  This book is full of history. It was so well researched, and yet it reads like a thriller, twisting its way through the horrors of World War II and its awful impacts on individuals, families, and cultures. As I read, I literally felt I was part of the action. I wanted to hide in terror at times, scream in anger at times, and even laugh at times. It was almost as if I were immersed in a time bubble. I was there! Everything one can imagine being in a historical romance, set amid the terror of the Nazi occupation of Europe, and its immediate aftermath, appears in this book. All I can say is this: get yourself a copy because this guy can write!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie hits on a tad bit of everything within each of us...and with humor!  I highly recommend this movie.
006079383X|5.0|I love this book.  I am going to buy the 6th ed. in the near future.  I want to read what Warren Buffet has to say.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Finally a story worth watching. Excellent production, fast moving and never disappointing! Looking forward to season 3. Praise for all involved in this splendid epic!!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I was surprised at Spielberg's creation.<br />I dont believe he had the audience of the 21st century in mind.<br />All generations should know and understand our past presidents but in modern day verbiage and with a bit more energy and color. Our children have been successfully brainwashed into nothing less.<br />As a Baby Boomer I could understand and appreciate it but, I'm afraid it wasn't so for many.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|So I really like this game.  The flipper response is a little weak, but other than that, a good game overall.
0375842209|2.0|Boy, did I struggle through this book! I'm a teacher and I read lots of young adult fiction and I kept waiting for the magic to happen with The Book Thief. It never did. It took me more than a month to get through it and I really had to force myself. Why? Well, part of it is I didn't like the narrator's voice. I give Zusak credit for trying but the narration felt strained to me. Zusak tried, but too hard. I like to lose myself in a book and not be aware of the writer behind it and I was always conscious reading this one that there was a writer, striving to be unique. And that is a failure, to me. The best parts for me were the relationship of Liesel and Hans and her slow recognition of Rosa's love, however crudely expressed. And her strange relationship with the mayor's wife. But Rudy never really came alive for me. And Max, who should have jerked some tears from my eyes, didn't pull it off. He was too whispy, too unengaging -- except in the writing he left for Liesel, when suddenly he had more personality. There is some nice writing at times but all too often I again felt Zusak straining to sound unique with his choice of words and again it didn't work for me. Zusak saved his best for last: I loved the final sentence. But not the whole book.

B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is fantastic. You may think this game is for idiots an  it is boring.but when I think about it it is like math. You must count blocks you build on and know how many blocks you need. It is a game for a smart mind to teach you architecting. But on the other hand I think there are too many glitches. One time I was going to the nether, and the reactor core kept disappearing and th  gold blocks.<br /><br />Thank you for reading :)
B008PSPNFG|4.0|Quite interesting!  I like to listen to music to glean an idea or two for my own playing, and I am always cautious about buying new music, this one included. Had wanted to hear an entire Steve Vai &#34;album,&#34; this was my first.  I will not be playing this music myself in the near future, but I like listening to it when I jog or when I drive.
B00BAYLQI0|2.0|I was prepared to dislike this movie.  It seemed trite to reduce one of the great tragedies of history to the story of a European tourist family.  Not only do you not learn much about how the 2004 tsunami affected the lives of the people of coastal Thailand (or any of the other regions affected by the event), but you don't really learn much about the family in the movie -- they're pretty much just stock characters to be moved around.<br /><br />  I was very disturbed by the conclusion, where the main lesson was that you need to have really good insurance, which will pay for a private jet to carry you to a good hospital in a developed country.  I don't think that was a common experience for most of the survivors of the 2004 tsunami.
B005I6EU48|5.0|This is a very durable case, and it holds well. At first I thought the straps that held it were too small, but it keeps it just snug enough it won't fall out. It has proven to be a good case, and I plan to use it for a while.<br />Honestly, I'd recommend it to anyone. Which I have to say I have, and she loves this case too.<br />Well done, Verso.
0525952926|4.0|I really enjoyed reading (and learning from) Follett's \\"Winter of the World.\\"  Here's why:<br /><br />The admittedly highly improbable (highly contrived, even) tangle of relationships and encounters between the second generation characters (the offspring of the main characters in \\"Fall of Giants\\") provides an amazing springboard to Follett's compelling history lesson.  In reading this book, you'll gain a keener appreciation for:<br />- How the harshly punitive terms of the Treaty of Versailles created the conditions in Germany under which the Nazis could ascend to power.<br />- Aktion T4, the Third Reich's heinous scheme to exterminate Germany's mentally and physically challenged citizens, and harbinger of the Holocaust.<br />- How desperately close democracy came to extinction in the 1940s as the Soviet Communist bloc expanded, fascists controlled the entire European mainland (and the notion of fascism was gaining a foothold among the rich and powerful in Great Britain and even the United States), and the Japanese empire was spreading across the western Pacific and East Asia.<br />- How difficult it would be for the average German citizen to truly know what was going on in terms of atrocities.<br />- How ruthless the Soviet authoritarian state was, how paranoid Stalin was, and how far off course the Revolution had gotten.<br />- The race, the risk, and the ethical challenges of developing the atomic bomb.<br />- The unavoidable advent of the Cold War and the rise of modern spycraft.
B005XZHQKY|4.0|I just love underwater films, as I dive myself. So I just love those videos, as it brings me back into the water
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Great read. Interesting to see it from a neurosurgeon's point of view. I believed in an afterlife before this book but it was neat to hear a perspective of someone that didn't always believe that way.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Ok, so I am a Reacher fanatic. Child created the biggest, toughest character in the world an gets him into more strife than Speed Gordon. Bring on the next book.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Itcame on time. I have watch it a number of times. goes good with the rest of them. buy it now.
B005OKTPKC|3.0|As far as a cracking yarn is concerned, this one is not. However, for some light and enjoyable reading where you don't have to think too hard, this one fits the bill.
B003SNJYSK|4.0|This is a very impressive novel starring Harry Hole,an alcoholic police investigator, unlike any other that I have come across. The novel combines the 21st century time-frame with a plot thread set in World War II. It is an extremely complex plot, with a massive cast  so there are a lot of people to remember. The book is pure noir, with bureaucracy and corruption just beneath the surface at each turn.<br /><br />If you are a fan of detective fiction, then don't miss this book.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I chose this because i wanted to check the weather up north.  we travel there every year, both summer and winter. Good source
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Sherlock Holmes is a timeless classic character and this collection can be enjoyed by both ardent fans of Holmes as well as people who haven't read any of his mysteries before. A good addition to my collection.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I play every day, trying to get three stars on all games.  i have done pretty well so far. will keep trying until i get them all.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Falling Skies is fantastic. If you haven't watched it yet, you are doing it wrong. It is so easy with Amazon Prime to catch up on the best show on TV.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I like Percy Jackson because he cares for his friends first and himself second. The only thing I didn't like was all the suspense at the end.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I liked the quirky characters and the friendship between them all. There was lots of violence, but somehow there was a lighthearted element to it that made it difficult to take too seriously. As an older person, I felt powered by the title concept described as  \\" Retired, Extremely Dangerous.\\" Entertaining.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I shows that even those who are in doubt about God and Heaven can become convinced that they are real and that there is a Spirit life that is more real that the life we are presently living.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|my little one didnt play this very long. she loved my little pony but she just wasnt too interesed in this game. not sure why.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|its a cute game. boys may like it more than my girls. they played it for a little while but just wasnt for them
B00BHMETKC|5.0|the cast was great. you will be hooked on this movie from beginning to end. if you know your history (i didnt) then you know what happens. if you don't then its a good history lesson.
B004LWZW2E|4.0|Watched this film before reading the description on Amazon.com.  Didn't realize it was intended to be a nightmare world.  Still, very interesting story line.  Entertaining. I enjoyed it!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|one of the best movie of Denzel, wow is the only description that apply , see it and you will agree with me
B003L77G6A|5.0|Fantastic cast and clever writing.  We need more shows like this.  Season 4 had plenty of plot changes to enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said. Can be challenging but good fun. You feel a sense of achievement when you meet the objectives since, depending on how good you are, it can take some time to accomplish. Nevertheless, I always keep coming back to this game. It just never gets old to me.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I just had to install this on my new tablet since I have it on all of my other computers. I consider it the best of pdf readers in my opinion and I hightly recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Nice game. I have never played Angry Birds before. So, when I purchased my tablet, one of the first games I downloaded was this. It can become very addictive in a very short amount of time. Nice way to waste some spare time.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I love the sound of Fun and my favorite song is &#34;Carry On&#34;.  I would highly recommend this, look forward t hearing more of their music in the future.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful graphics!  I'm addicted to this!  The puzzles require multiple steps to solve and are very challenging.  I hope to find more games from this creator!
B00003CXAT|1.0|This NON working NON readable disk appears to be a counterfeit knock off. Will not read in any of the players it was tried in. No seal on package so I am not sure who made it or when. I NEED to return it asap.<br />Thank you<br />Robert Woods
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I borrow e-books from my local library, to borrow a book, I have to chose it, go to Amazon, then check it out again, then chose which android I have, even though I only have one, it shows five, then download.  Also, it does not work for the free downloads that are supposed to come with Amazon Prime.  Now I understand why it is free, I sure wouldn't pay for it.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Was overly noisy and jangly and not that much fun. There are lots of others like this that are more pleasurable.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Absolutely loved these movies as a kid. Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Harold Ramis & Ernie Hudson were a great combination. Loved Rick Moranis, Annie Potts and Sigourney Weaver as well. The giant Marshmallow Man and the Statue of Liberty in the sequel were the most memorable scenes that have stayed with for me a long time. Definitely a classic and perfect blend of the comedy and supernatural/horror genre.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|The fault in our stars. A profound story that is both far away from me and deeply close. Rendering me with a feeling that is simultaneously horrible and partly wonderful. A must read. I feel as if I just suffered heartache in the hands of a paperback (on kindle)
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Great product, fits and protects perfectly without hiding the phone's design. Strongly recommended. The screen protector is also excellent and does not interfere on the quality of the images.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a great work watch your wrist does not get sweaty and glowers in the dark real well so you can get that second sleep.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love it. I have played meny games and I find this one the best. And it works great on the kindle.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great for the beginner just starting to work out and get fit. Constantly keeps you moving and only 27 minutes
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|We watch the Matt Smith Doctor Who and thought it was time to go back and start from the first of the new. Love it
1878424319|3.0|A little wordy. The concept is good, but too much filler context is used. Which waters down the overall concept. I especially lke the second agreement, &#34;Dont take anything personal&#34;.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|The movie was good, but the I rented in HD and had choppy downloads and poor video quality.  This is more due to Amazon Video.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I didn't really expect that I would use this much as I am only a recreational Nexus user. Now I use it daily. Easy to use. And, it's easy to see that it's time to quit playing graphic intense games for a bit and read until the power rises up. I bought the pro because they deserve to get something for this.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|It came quickly and it's a good movie with great special effects. I am a big fan of the Lord of the Ring movies
B007REV4YI|5.0|It came fast and as expected. It is a movie that keeps going all the time and really sets up for another. Can't wait
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't wait to watch Season 3. Best show I've seen in long time. The actors are all great and just love the story.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|good movie, good budget, good FX, good place everything perfect for a Kung Fu movie fly style like in the 70,80 no romantic only action, kind a confuse in the beginning but is ok, good taste for choose the Chinese girls, Lucy Liu so hot, the only thing is that Q never show naked woman )))))))) well is ok for the family kids father mother grannies, doggy, wife, husband, lover, cat, grab your popcorn is a excellent Kung Fu movie for the Sunday afternoon, enjoy
B0034G4ORC|2.0|POORLY DONE, should be called 'Faces and Helmets'..... extremely limited photos, hard to follow story looking at helmets at all angles.....
B00006J9OT|5.0|love it. It's a regular in my car cd rotation. good sound and tight musicianship.  I think it's definitely her best album
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Great characters. The story had some major plausibility holes but was still a fun read. I have read a lot of his books and this will not be the last.
B009MYAQK4|4.0|Must read To inspire yourself in a diferente way you usually do! Coelho did an excellent work in imagination and on powering our self improvement energy.
B004NOCCEG|3.0|Without the political message it would be a good review of the crisis.  I don't think I should have had to purchase.  Rental would be more appropriate.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I am so glad I was channel surfing on TV one day and saw the last 30 minutes of this movie. There are so many 'classic' scenes to enjoy over and over. Every major performer 'nailed' their role.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. So addictive<br />I can't seem to stop playing this game. Who ever crested this is a genius. This is by so far the best game I have ever played.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I like this clock. It is loud enough you can hear it so it will wake you up. I would recommend it to anyone needing<br />An extra clock or for travel. Great looking clock.. They did a good job on it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Don't get me wrong I love this game but it just gets boring after a while. Would love it if you could spice it up a little.
B005HSL626|5.0|I just love fruit ninja!!! It gets a little bit boring after a while but that's just probably because I am a big game player and I play it to much. I don't think that I will ever stop playing it though.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The characters were well developed.  I felt like I was there with Lavinia and all the others. I hope for a sequel.
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|This is one of the most frustrating games I've come across. I couldn't even get beyond level 2. You have to hold down the forward, reverse, or stop button with your right hand while sliding the steering \\"wheel\\" to the right or left with your left hand to turn. It's not that it's just hard - it's completely non-intuitive especially when, after you've made a turn and the car is going in the opposite direction, you have to slide the steering wheel to the left to turn right and to the right to turn left (while holding the forward button)! There is very little room to maneuver so a U-turn takes multiple forward, reverses, and turns to avoid hitting the curb. If you hit the curb three times, you get sent back to the beginning.<br /><br />I downloaded it as a free app of the day so haven't lost any money over this and gave it a couple of stars because the graphics are decent (although I only saw the first two levels) and it seems to work as intended. But nobody should pay any money for this!
0984999302|5.0|Steve Blank's and Bob Dorf's \\"The Startup Owner's Manual\\" captures the lean start-up techniques Blank has been showcasing in his Lean LaunchPad program at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas Business School. Blank gained his insights as a serial entrepreneur while Dorf, the \\"midwife of Customer Development,\\" befriended Blank as he critiqued early versions of Blank's \\"Four Steps to the Epiphany.\\" Lean LaunchPad which emerged from their collaboration provides new business development tools tailored exclusively to the needs of early stage companies.<br /><br />Blank, the father of the \\"Lean Startup\\" Movement,\\" gained an insight while developing and teaching customer development methodology. He realized that there are critical differences between early stage companies and large companies. \\"Startups are not smaller versions of large companies...while larger companies execute a business model, start-ups look for one. This distinction is at the heart of the lean start-up approach. It shapes the lean definition of a start-up: a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Startup Owner's Manual\\" was written as a manual for small business entrepreneurship, scalable startups, buyable startups, large company entrepreneurship, and social entrepreneurs focused on reducing market/customer risk (vs. invention risk).<br /><br />Blank and Dorf have organized the book around \\"Customer Discovery\\" and \\"Customer Validation.\\" The authors urge the reader to start with the glossary at the end of the book since the core of the book centers on customer development which has a language of its own. The first two chapters which are devoted to the philosophy of customer development can also be useful to align company stakeholders from day one - - cofounders, initial employees, investors, and advisors.<br /><br />Finding success as a start-up is a \\"relentless search to refine its mission and idea and to make changes in every aspect of the business invalidated during the search process. Entrepreneur seeks to test a series of unproven hypotheses (guesses) about a startups business model. The young company's focus is on searching for the answers to what makes a repeatable and scalable business model.\\" \\"The Startup Owner's Manual\\" provides a step-by-step method that will maximize the company's potential for success.<br /><br />Another book that would be complementary to \\"The Startup Owners Manual\\" is \\"The Entrepreneur's Manifesto\\" which shows how to apply Clayton Christensen's principles on disruption to the business model of an early stage company. Choosing a disruptive business model increases the success of an early stage company significantly. \\"Manifesto\\" is useful in insuring a successful grand strategy, while \\"Owner's Manual\\" is useful in insuring successful execution.<br /><br />Blank and Dorf are changing the landscape with their cutting edge work. \\"MBA programs are adopting their techniques and the business plan competitions that have been a celebrated part of the MBA experience for over a decade are being replaced by business model competitions. (Harvard Business School became the latest to make this switch, in 2012.) Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley, and Columbia are leading the charge and embracing the lean start-up curriculum. Blank's Lean LaunchPad course for educators is now training over 250 college and university instructors a year.\\"aspect of the business invalidated during the search process.

B007N6NGYG|4.0|This game is well thought out, the controls work well, and the graphics are cute. I would rate it 5 stars for quality, but I can't in all honesty say that \\"I love it\\" because I find it gets too difficult too soon. I have gotten through level 11 in Industrial theme, but only after replaying it multiple times. I wish that after a train crashes or arrives at the wrong station, it would give you a chance to examine what you did wrong before returning you immediately to the beginning.<br /><br />Probably younger players with faster reaction times can do much better than me.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|This is a great band and the set is excellent. I'm enjoying the albums more today than back when they were new.
B0016Q6CQI|3.0|I loved the show and thought the musical episode was brilliant. However, this soundtrack doesn't cut the mustard. First off the mixes here are slightly different than what was on the episode itself. Second they cut out dialogue bits important to the songs. Third, they left out what I thought was the best song, even though it wasn't part of the musical episode. The song sung by Anya that was part of season 7 episode 4 'Selfless' and I guess it's called I'm Gonna Be His Missus. That was actually a really great song and it should have been on this soundtrack. So ok overall, but Joss Whedon could have let it be a heck of a lot better.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The beginning was a great set up the middle had a nice twist the end fell flat. I was some excuted for him only to be terrible disapointed by the final outcome. Crazy.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|This album was everything an Owl City album should be.  Adam Young doesn't disappoint with his catchy beats and intriguing lyrics...not to mention that some songs are just plain fun.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I am hard of hearing, and because of this, I cannot get the sound loud enough to be able to hear it.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I LOVE this game but once I get to world 3 it won't even let me start the level it just makes me die. No matter how much I try to move out the way I still die. Please fix this.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|If you like the vulgar, sometimes over the top comedies, then you will likely love this movie.  The plot is pretty simple, three guys hate their bosses and go from talking about killing them, to actually planning to kill them when things go wrong.  I think all of the actors did a great job.  Bateman was very much like his character from Arrested Development with looser morals.  Aniston really stole the show in a role that was totally different than anything she had ever played before.  You can tell she was just trying to play it as over the top as possible.  The other one who just really got into the role was Spacy.  He played his character without any redeeming qualities and really did make you hate him.<br /><br />Like I said if you like the brand of humor then you will like this movie.  There is a lot of sexual humor (mostly involving Aniston's character), and some bathroom humor.  It is mainly about the stupid plan put together and badly executed by the main characters.  From trying to find a hitman, to the reconnaissance gone wrong everything just sort of spirals out of control.  The special features include deleted scenes and a couple behind the scenes things.  Nothing too extensive though, so if you are only inclined to get the actual discs when there are a lot of good bonus material you may just want to rent it.  If you are one of those people who need a movie to be realistic and logical, this is not one for you.  But for everyone else it is worth checking out.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|At first I was weary of buying a drawing app but this is great! Ive tried many drawing apps and this is by far the best. on a scale of 1-10 I give this app an 11
B000EZ7ZYA|4.0|When this movie was not taking itself too seriously and almost spoofing the romantic comedy, it was very good.  It was funny in a lot of parts, and the actors had very good chemistry.  Then for some reason it felt the need to become a \\"typical\\" romantic comedy and do almost the exact opposite of what it did for the first 3/4 of the movie.  If they had stuck to that formula, I think it would have been perfect.<br /><br />Kevin James was the total scene stealer in the movie.  He was never afraid of making a fool of himself, and you could tell that he and Will Smith were having a lot of fun working off each other.  Eva Mendes played bitter very well.  She also showed she has very good comedic chops and was not just eye candy. It is a good date night movie.  It does get kind of schlocky at the end, and while it keeps the movie from being as good as it could have been, it does not take away from the entire thing.
B002DYKPH4|2.0|The first one is the best the others one ok the last ones were a little predictable to me i still watch them
B00BYKIKJS|4.0|Good acting.  DeNiro does best acting we have seen for a while.<br />Ending a little contrived.<br />Nice look at mental illness.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|i have it on my ds so i decided to get it on my kindle i figured that it was pretty much super  scribble nauts so i play  it every day i can
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|We enjoy getting to know the characters. Bought the season, eagerly waiting for the next episode. A great adaptation of the Holmes/Watson legend.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I keep coming back for more.  Easy to navigate.  I wish it weren't so good; I would waste less time.
B00AJER3SE|4.0|I have seen this movie twice in theatres and many times in standard defination on television. I really enjoyed the high defination that the bluray brought to my television and the improved sound. I think an excellent job was done by the techs that did the remaster.<br /><br />Foster
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Interestiong look into our history. Humor at times but the content is king. While it is slow where you might expect it to be it opens a different look at our country and the presidents. God has his hand on this counrty or we never would have made it to this point. Gives a new meaning to the term leadership.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|worth it fun stradgy game diffre&ntilde;t<br />  levles and just filled with fun  MOST GET NOW it rilly is a joyride
B007N8RULO|5.0|Use all the time.  Keeps you playing.<br />I like playing spider solitude  I like to get free playing games.<br />SPIDER Silitaire.......
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I loved this game. It is very challenging...trying to find 3 symbols in a row while  keeping the music  scale.going was a lot of fun. I highly recommended this game. It  kept me busy for hours
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fast moving. Some kitchenware so hard that I can't figure out how the lines are supposed to go so I just skip to rhinestone.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|The story described India, a place I've never been, that I felt I was there.  I felt I was living the story.
B006YGMHTQ|4.0|Robin Williams ability to play different roles and brings them to life, is amazing.  Any Robin Williams movie is usually atleast good, but this one is better then most
1475972350|1.0|I also bought this because the premise sounded intriguing and so many reviewers had given it five stars -- which suggests that the writer must have a large family and lots of friends.  This is hands down the worst mystery I've ever read.  For that matter, it's the worst book I've ever read.  The descriptions are wooden, the dialogue clunky, the plotting repetitive.  Plus, as another reviewer wrote, the detectives are idiots.  The book is actually painful to read.  Even at 1.99 for the Kindle version, it's a waste of money.  Worse, it's a waste of time -- kind of ironic, given a plot in which the killer is taking revenge on people who waste his time.
B008602KQI|3.0|Movie loads well and is excellent in quality. The reason for only three stars instead of five... The only issue is it freezes if you resume watching as opposed to starting from begebning
B0044FEZBM|5.0|This new remake of Flames of Paris is near perfect.<br />The changed story adds a better dimension of the humanity part of the French Revolution.<br />Needles to say, Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev are indeed peerless.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Ian Rankin is a great story teller. it has lots of twists and tension. a great thriller. Very much recommended.
B007ZSBQYE|5.0|About the controls. They are responsive. You need to press it in short burst to accelerate slowly. If leave it press the car will almost drag race down the street. everything else is good of this gave. Have played several levels... drived car, trucks and buses withour any problem. Much better than the other truck parking app.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Although I read this after &#34;The Hit&#34; it should be read first. &#34;The Innocent&#34; sets the stage for &#34;The Hit&#34; and does so in stellar fashion.  I found it difficult to put down but did find myself wondering if all of the twists and turns were possible. I doubt we'll ever know!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The remastering is the best of any classic movie done to this day, especially on Alien.  Its as if you were watching a movie just filmed last year.  And you get the whole series for a nice price.
B001NKI60W|5.0|Not quite as enjoyable as seeing the show live, but a great capture of the energy. Meryl shows her range.
B007B6VOG0|3.0|There are some absolutely outstanding songs on this album. Unfortunately, there are also many songs that I simply want to fast forward through. These guys are very talented, and I would like to see them really push themselves.
030758836X|3.0|Good twists and turns and I actually wanted to keep reading, but the end was a huge disappointment.  This book needed to end sooner than it did.  To me it sounded like the author wasn't quite sure how to keep it going, so there was a lot of idiotic and unnecessary material in the last few chapters with a truly anticlimactic ending.  I ended up feeling annoyed that I spent my time reading it.  Don't waste your time.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Great movie. Great script. Great acting from young actors, I look forward to their developing careers. The extra almost-2-hours-long documentary was excellent
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|Good actors cant make up for poor directing. Penn is very good as Mickey Cohen but the movie itself feels like Dick Tracy at times.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|The only difference between this used set and a set new from the store would be the missing cellophane wrapper.  Hat's off to the seller.<br />The set itself holds a few disappointments with the quality of the earlier movies. They are far from unacceptable, but they are certainly NOT blu-ray definition, although they bear the blu-ray label.  Maybe that's as good as it gets for the older ones?  Seems to me like those movies are recent enough that they should be able to be presented much better than they are. Still, they are &#34;Durn Good Def&#34;, the later movies are flawless and 8 movies for $40 is still a great deal.
