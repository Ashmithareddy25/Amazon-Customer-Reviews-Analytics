B00B0NDQPC|5.0|I am rediscovering the songs and artists from the past and really appreciate it when today's artists return to these musical roots and give a new interpretation to the standards.  Emmy Rossum's album is a wonderful example of this.  She has a wonderful voice and puts emotion into every song.  I hope this isn't the last such album she produces.

B0014VQGX4|3.0|We've gone through two of these backhoes in our house. My boys love them but each one has broken at around 18 months.  The loader just snaps onto the boom and the thin plastic can only take so much stress before it cracks.  A five-star toy if I didn't have to send it to the trash every year and a half.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|I just watched this great movie on HDnet for the 39th time. It is mesmerizing--when you happen upon it, you can't leave it. And leave it to the Italians to make one of the greatest westerns ever--if not the greatest. What makes a great movie? The story,of course. Or the story within the story. I need not elaborate. But the actors count, too. If you haven't seen Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale, Jason Robards and Charles Bronson up close--very close, you haven't seen this movie. Just one Italian there--the beautiful Claudia. Fonda is about as tall and evil as he would ever dare to be on film. Bronson became a star for his role--and not because he played the harmonica. But the guy who steals this show is Jason Robards, as the witty, good-hearted outlaw who in the end gets to meet his maker--with a wink, maybe.  The other ingredients--the memorable music by Ennio Morricone and the incomparable direction of Sergio Leone--the man of a thousand closeups. Bravo, Italia.

0143034901|3.0|There were too many stories within the two main stories.  Descriptions of people, buildings, and parts of Barcelona were overly embellished; and God help me, if I were to read the word \\"shadow\\" one more time I would have thrown this book across my room.  Yet, some of the characters were interesting - if I could remember which story line they belonged to - and I liked the overall feel of it.
6305718954|3.0|\\"The Exorcist\\" had a huge impact in Film. It was no cheap outing. Yes. It was high powered for the time. Nothing like that had been done before and it caught many off guard. But it had a good script, good performances, a good subtext and William Friedkin at the the helm. So, of course, many chased it trying to achieve that level of expertise and success. This might have been closer than many, but, for my dollar, it still came up short.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Patricia Arquette plays Frankie Paige. She's a beautician in Philly who begins to experience odd events including classic symptoms of stigmata. Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) works for the Vatican as an investigator or these sorts of phenomenon. He's put on the case and wants to dismiss it because Arquette is an atheist, and atheists don't experience stigmata. Odd things pile up and he begins to change his mind.<br /><br />I found this all to be overwrought. In \\"The Exorcist\\", as intense as things got, it all hung together and effected the viewer at a deep level. Part of that might have been the late 60s, 'the world is changing', subtext. But it had great gravity. Here I got the impression the director, Rupert Wainright, was just trying too hard. He really went after it and that might be the problem. Everything was just too. And Patricia Arquette, even though she'd been in the biz for awhile didn't work for me. With the exception of a couple of scenes, I don't feel as though she found the right notes. I like Gabriel Byrne and he doesn't disappoint here. Jonathan Pryce, as Cardinal Houseman, was also good. He exemplified the self righteous and corrupt posture of the Vatican in its wanting to squash anything that might chip away at its position of power.<br /><br />This isn't a bad watch by any means. It moves at a fair clip and has a good Hollywood sheen on it. I just couldn't get past what it was trying to be. It had no authority in its own right.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Truly an amazing novel. What I loved so much about it is beautiful imagery the author uses. He truly defined the power of words in a way few have done and allowed me to understand more fully the power of love and emotion and doing what's right amidst so much wrong. I recommend this book to anyone, it is a must read.
B005PK57IK|3.0|While there are parts of this program that I like, there are others that I would prefer not to see.  I don't think that trying to impose social views should be part of entertainment.  Some of the actors/actresses on the program are good and you either like them or dislike them.  I am learning a great deal about lawyers and Chicago.  It is certainly not a positive experience.  I really don't know if the program was designed to give viewers this negative view.  It's a good thing that older programs, such as Perry Mason or Murder She Wrote are still available for viewing.  You can watch about 50 minutes of these programs and actually enjoy them.  As for lawyers and &#34;the Chicago way&#34;, I've learned a lot about how lawyers operate and the real wheeling and dealing of Chicago politics.  I always knew politics was a dirty business but never realized just how dirty.  I have now changed my opinion of what may be the lowest professions.  The mainstream media is now at the bottom, followed by politicians, then lawyers, and used car salesmen.  Used car salesmen is no longer at the bottom, in my opinion (as one of the judges on The Good Wife requires lawyers to say).

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I don't care, by now everyone knows that the bad guy is none other than Khan Noonien Singh, and knowing that \\"spoiler\\" (which it's not) would help to sell the movie to an older generation of Trekkies (worked for my dad).  And Benedict Cumberbatch does a great job playing the evil superhuman character, although I must complain that he was British and not from India (how did a white guy get a name like Khan?).  JJ Abrams brings his usual lens-flare camera-action style into the film, but he also quickens the pace of everything.  You get 15 minutes of non-stop awesome action, then 5 hilarious Trek jokes, then 15 minutes action, 5 more jokes (repeat until end of movie).  This sci-fi blockbuster moves along quickly and did not feel like it was over 2 hours.  It never gave me time to go to the bathroom, but I didn't need to because I never had time to drink any of my overpriced beverage.  I wonder how much of the movie was cut due to time?  (note to self: get special edition on blu-ray when released).  I did have a great experience, and I highly recommend seeing it in the theater.  Awesome sound, special effects, and Star Trek technobabble make it worth paying $20 bucks.  Now the cons (besides Khan): There are a few plot holes that Trekkie purists will tear apart, but to give more spoilers now would really divulge the whole plot.  And be sure to note that I have to remove almost a whole star due to those technicalities.  So I rate it 4.2/5 stars.  It's a good Trek movie, moves faster than its predecessor, and has more action (not to mention it's an \\"even\\" movie). There are also plenty of great surprises.  However the plot holes dig out the borg-like perfection this movie could have been.  ~Keep On Trekkin'

B00BCOQSSQ|2.0|I had a gut feeling about The First Pillar, after finishing the first chapter. Before accepting the review request, I read the reviews on it and most praised the novel, and those that didn't indicated that it was probably meant more for the young adult readers. As a reader in between the young adult and adult audience, I couldn't agree with them. This book was not without potential but I don't believe the author utilized the story to its fullest.<br /><br />It started with the first chapter. Those five pages needed to set the story up for the rest of the book and instead, as a reader, I was left with several questions. I knew nothing about the main character, Owen, and I had to stop and flip back through the book in the hopes that I missed a prologue or something of the sort. By the end of chapter four, I was ready to give up on the book completely. Huff uses exposition to the point that I knew nothing about the characters. He spent more than enough time trying to describe a scene but the characters themselves were left to the imagination of the reader. This translated into no noticeable character growth throughout the novel. And the setting Huff tried to set so well instead became, quite frankly, useless. He could have set it in Owen's hometown and I don't think it would've really made a difference.<br /><br />I gave up on trying to find a decent \\"action\\" scene. The amount of exposition combined with one of Cinder's favorite terms, the deus ex machina, created a lack of tension and provided no encouragement to continue reading. This is shown in the very beginning of the novel where the Keeper brings out a little machine and suddenly Owen knows everything he needs to know. This idea of just providing the reader with all the knowledge proves to be quite annoying when all you read is the narrator telling you what's happening. It's as if Owen never experiences anything himself. Instead of the characters acting a certain way, we're told they're something and expected to just go with that. On top of the passive text, I found the novel in need of editing. Words were misspelled, improper uses of grammar were littered throughout, and the transitions made for very awkward and stilted reading at times.<br /><br />While this book received rave reviews from other readers, it wasn't for me. I think The First Pillar holds a lot of potential and could be expanded on greatly. If the reader was allowed to experience the story through Owen's eyes instead of being told it, I believe the novel would be a much stronger piece of work as well as allowing for a good set-up for a sequel. There is potential here but I don't think it's been realized yet.just go with that. On top of the passive text, I found the novel in need of editing.

0865478007|4.0|Yes, as Dr. Goldacre reports at great length, the systems of reporting - or not reporting - clinical trials is faulty. Yes big pharma is out to make big money, so they do many things to get as many doctors as possible to write scripps for their drugs. Yes, they buy lunch for residents and give out cups and company baseball caps to doctors (though far less than they did in the past). Some drugs come to market, are proven to have unacceptable side effects, and are either pulled or are given a \\"black box\\" warning. Some doctors are on the take, most aren't.<br /><br />The good news is that no institution has saved more lives and made more lives better than big pharma. Most of their drugs work. Most of their drugs are affordable or become affordable once they go off-patent. Dr. Goldacre is way too hostile given all the good that these companies do.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've now had these headphones for about 7 months. I wanted to wait and see how they would hold up over time. So far they've been perfect. I was considering the Grado SR-60 as I heard they had the best sound under $100, however there were quite a few things that made this pair more appealing.<br />1. The Grado's are open backed, which may allow for superior sound, but apparently also makes your music slightly hearable to those nearby. I bought these for blocking out outside noise in computer labs and the library so I think this pair is a more practical choice as they have very little noise bleed.<br />2. The collabsible factor is a little iffy but makes these headphones a very pragmatic choice as a they can easily collaspse and be stowed away for transport. This feature also brings up my one (minor) complaint with these headphones. The mechanism to collaspse them feels a little flimsy. Again, this is a very minor issue, but it sometimes feels as though the hinge should be bulkier for the amount of pressure that's exerted on it. It should be known that this has yet to give me a problem and I did not hear it being an issue with anyone else when I looked at other reviews for these.<br /><br />One more very slight complaint is that the material on the earpads can get a little sticky after listening for a while as it doesn't breathe very well. A popular option that I tried is to upgrade the pads to the Byerdynamic velour pads. With these new pads the headphones are amazing for long listening and extremely comfortable.<br /><br />On the whole these are a great deal at this price and are a very solid pair of headphones. I would give them my full recommendation.

0670014893|5.0|A Delicate Truth<br />John le Carre<br />Penguin<br />In a riveting return to form, spymaster John le Carre gives his readers a ringside seat as a top-secret counter-terror operation goes pear shaped.<br />Like Watergate, the cover-up eclipses the crime itself as British spies collude with an American based private defence contractor called Ethical Options, to silence the whistleblowers forever, if they can't be bribed.<br />In 2008, Operation Wildlife on the British colony of Gibraltar was conceived to kidnap a jihardist arms buyer. Using as cover a middle ranking British civil servant Paul Anderson (The Birdwatcher), in reality Kit Probyn, a tragedy unfolds, the details of which are hidden for most of le Carre's 23rd novel. `Paul' is told the mission is an unqualified success and is duly rewarded for his role.<br />Three years on `Paul' as Sir Kit Probyn has settled down to the good life in the English countryside with his invalid wife and feisty daughter Emma, a doctor and idealist.<br />Their idyll crumbles when Sir Kit learns what really happened on Gibraltar.<br />Le Carre reveals his story in conversations that are a pleasure to read. At 81, his dialogue is as crisp and nuanced as that which ordained him as a great writer when he produced The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1963).<br />I'm willing to bet not many of us would take a bullet for publicly exposing the paranoia and incompetence of the state's intelligence apparatus as it deals with terrifying extremists. Especially not were we offered a bucketful of cash to keep stum.<br />But le Carre has crafted two such doughty characters in a Welsh Special Forces hero called Jeb Owens and Toby Bell, the private secretary to the corrupt Minister for Defence who sanctioned Operation Wildlife in the first place. But what about Shorty, Andy and Don who were also on that hillside in Gibraltar? Will they capitulate?<br />When Jeb fails to turn up at Kit's Cornish mansion, Toby tracks down his wife Brigid, who is beautifully drawn as the tough as nails ex cop who was left by police to clean up her husband's truck after he supposedly blew his brains out. She doesn't believe Jeb killed himself leaving her to raise their son and she is persuaded by Toby to hand over a piece of evidence that is a ticking time bomb for the public servant with a conscience.<br />A Delicate Truth pits the little guys up against the might of UK military industrial complex and a cashed up guns-for-hire corporation in the US.<br />The ending is ambiguous but in your guts you know it's not going to turn out well for the whistleblower.<br />Highly recommended.tifully drawn as the tough as nails ex cop who was left by police to clean up her husband's truck after he supposedly blew his brains out.

B007TKT2SK|5.0|When I saw the icon for today's FAOTD, my immediate reaction was, &quot;Seriously? ANOTHER Calculator?&quot;  However, after reading the description and nearly half of the reviews with both positive &amp; negative feedback, I thought, perhaps, if this app works as well as the majority claim, it could actually be quite useful for me.<br /><br />After the initial download &amp; install, because of the app's simple, yet intuitive design, it took less than 2 minutes for me to come to these conclusions:<br />1. This app would be a DAILY help for me.<br />2. The app does EXACTLY as it claims to do and, does so... quickly and ACCURATELY.<br />3. I won't just be keeping Fraction Calculator Plus on my device but, it'll be taking up PERMANENT residence!<br /><br />It's very easy to use &amp; provides a fast, accurate calculation of either a fraction or in decimal point. There is an easy to understand &quot;tutorial/explanation&quot; on how to use the calculator when you first open app. The numbers are clear and large, making them easy to read with the ability to rotate your screen to either landscape or portrait view.<br /><br />If you use fractions in your daily life  for work, school or home, then I highly recommend that you get this app!

0307341577|1.0|I bought both \\"Dark Places\\" and \\"Sharp Objects\\" after reading Gillian Flynn's extraordinary work \\"Gone Girl.\\"  Neither \\"Places\\" nor \\"Objects\\" is even close to the skill and creativity of \\"Gone Girl.\\"  To the contrary, both of Flynn's earlier works feature characters so deeply damaged I could not imagine a future for any of them.  That the Day family trips from one horrific event to the next with every single family member making terribly ill-advised decisions throughout left me exhausted.  Is it really possible for all of them to be that inept and foolish?  I grew so frustrated with the whole lot of them that their final days were largely inconsequential to me.  Frankly I suspect death was welcome for all - which isn't a spoiler as not everyone dies, although virtually all of them wished to at some point.  I read to the end but resent the terrible waste of my reading time.  No story should be void of sympathetic characters and this one is, with the exception of one person - Debby.  I could not have cared less about any of the rest of them, all receiving just what they deserved.

B006QPX7UI|4.0|The reviews here about the specifics of the battle are enlightening, and I appreciate them all.<br /><br />I will state that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br />Now, where are my quibbles:<br /><br />Two many foot soldiers (North and South) appear too well fed. Think about it: They are constantly walking, on the move. They are fed the bare minimum (especially the South) and yet I saw portly older men marching down the road. Weariness is not an option.<br /><br />Too many clean-shaven men. How many opportunities come up that present water and shavers and time to the foot soldiers?<br /><br />Far too many 50ish-looking men. Like most wars, only our young men are expendible (and I write that with sadness).<br /><br />The officers' clothing (especially the South's_ are way too clean. Some look as if dry cleaning occurred that morning.<br /><br />Some of the hats worn, especially by Berenger and Sam Elliott seem buffonish, exaggerated cowboy hats that would seem more at home Gilly's dance hall on a 1980s Saturday night.<br /><br />I know, these seem like minor annoyances. But to a purist, they nag. You have to suspend belief with most movies but these quibbles make it harder to do.<br /><br />Still, I'd recommend this movie.<br /><br />And Jeff Daniel's speech to the Maine soldiers who didn't want to fight further, well, that is a speech to die for. Daniel's humbleness and earnestness almost left me in tears.

B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Ok folks; here's my spoiler-free review of Star Trek: Into Darkness:<br /><br />First off I'll say that this was, hands down, a fun, fun film to see.  J.J. Abrams certainly knows how to carry an audience and cast a film - which is more than a minor achievement given that he's playing with something that is considered nearly sacred... as in sacred in the religious sense by untold millions of people.  For a veritable unknown in the Trek world AND an admitted non-fan of the franchise (He's since reversed that position, by the way), J.J. has proved himself adept at understanding and respecting his audience - even if he stretches the credulity of the `old timers' almost to a breaking point in some cases to make his mark on the now 50 year old brain child of a world war II pilot who had a dream and a pen.<br /><br />I want to get the negatives out of the way first so I can, in true Star Trek fashion, end this on a positive note.  And I should mention here that any perceived negative is so expertly blended with J.J.'s brisk paced yet conscientiously balanced style of story-telling that you almost forget you had an objection in the first place.  Damn you, J.J.! You actually made me feel good while giving me some pretty big objections to quibble over!  It's a love-hate thing for me.  Anyone who's as vested as me in Star Trek as a vehicle for intelligent story-telling will understand what I mean when they see the film for themselves.<br /><br />My first objection is the use of very visibly superfluous plot contrivances solely for the sake of putting characters (and in my view of Trek, the Enterprise is as much a character as the flesh and blood cast) in places where they get to do something that looks \\"Really, really cool\\".  Abrams seems to put the cart before the horse in the sense that he has a visual idea of what he would like to see and THEN finds a way to integrate that into the story.  A couple of examples:<br /><br />We are treated to a visually breathtaking opening sequence that puts the Starship Enterprise at the bottom of an alien world ocean and then lifted out in dramatic fashion for an atmospheric flight into the heavens...  Just think about what the Enterprise is in terms of design elements for a moment and let that sink in.  We're talking about suspending 190,000 tons of various metal alloys in a body of water, holding it at station keeping, lifting it out of the water, and maneuvering it through the atmosphere.  The whole purpose of Star Trek's starship design elements was to eliminate the need for atmospheric landings or maneuverings.  There are very practical reasons that shuttle crafts and transporters are included in the ship's complement of resources.  Not to mention the fact that it would be much less of a resource-heavy operation to simply place the Enterprise in high orbit and conduct ground operations using shuttle craft and transporters in the first place.<br /><br />Next, we have a scene where Spock (Zachary Quinto) is standing inside an active volcano with a device that can render the volcano inert.  Again, it is visually a sight to behold - breathtaking really.  But it's completely unnecessary.  We're supposedly living in a time where we can convert matter to a data energy stream and place it, within a few millimeters of margin of error, exactly where we want it and then reconvert it to matter.  Even if we can't use this amazing technology, you're telling me that a species that designed something as incredible as this could find no other means of lowering a device to the right spot in the volcano and remote detonating it?  And it's obvious enough that you are (or will if you haven't seen it yet) having these thoughts while it's happening and you're STILL gonna think it's cool as hell!  You see what I mean by love-hate relationships?  Again, damn you J.J.!!!<br /><br />My next objection is to the patently egregious use of glad-handed throw backs to the original television series and movies for the old-time fans.  During the film's third act there is a climactic scene where these throw backs are coming at you at such a rapid rate of delivery that it actually detracts from the story that they're trying to tell - which would be a fine story in its own right; a great vehicle for some fantastic character development - especially as it concerns Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Quinto).  I understand why these elements were included in the first film of the reboot franchise.  It was done deftly and was balanced in such a way that made you clap and cheer and feel good in all those fuzzy ways because you knew Abrams was really genuinely trying to respect the core fan audience even as he cracked Star Trek wide open for mass appeal.  It worked at the time and it worked very, very well.<br /><br />But enough is enough.  We get it, J.J.  Really.  We don't need it in this second installment.  Star Trek (2009) was a fantastic setup.  You can take things anywhere you want now and we'll all be ok with it... I promise!  In Star Trek: Into Darkness, throwbacks are formulaic and paced to the point of absurdity.<br /><br />Ok, those are my two big objections.  The rest I can just rattle off without getting into too much detail.  Admiral Marcus's (Peter Weller) motives are not made entirely clear in this film.  It's obvious that his character is allegorical to G.W. Bush and, it was a pretty well done allegory at that.  But still, I had a difficult time understanding the \\"why's\\" for his \\"who's, what's, where's, and when's\\".  He is a little one-dimensional and, hence, not as believable as a character.<br /><br />Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) was nearly irrelevant.  She could have been replaced with some technicians already assigned to the Enterprise and the impact and emotional effect would have been the same.  There was a lot more that could have been done with her character but she's relegated to little more than an eye candy prop piece to set up another thread of continuity for future franchise installments.<br /><br /> John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) as a character is written a bit thin.  We don't get quite enough to invest ourselves on the level of... say... Heath Ledger's \\"Joker\\" in `The Dark Knight'.  For me, that will stand as the benchmark for film villains for... forever.  But Cumberbatch more than makes up for that (I'll deal with that in the positives in a moment).<br /><br />And finally, while there are numerous egregious violations of various laws of physics, as well as a few lazy dismissals of cause-and-effect relationships, and action/reaction interchanges, they are woven into a genuinely beautiful piece of filmmaking in such a way that I can safely not worry about them.<br /><br />OK!  Now for the good stuff!<br /><br />First: This film works, and works well primarily because of its cast.  Brilliant.  Hands down brilliant casting.  Thank you J.J. and company for taking the time to research and invest in the meaning and quality of these characters enough to make us love them... not just accept them as replacements.  Of particular mention is Zachary Quinto.  What he has done - is doing - with Spock's character is nothing short of beautifully poignant.  There is a depth and complexity there that is truly wonderful to behold -while being completely faithful to the storied history of this icon of science fiction lore.<br /><br />But Quinto is not alone in deserving praise.  Pine's Kirk is stretched and molded - many times against his protestations - in this film and itis a refreshing departure from Shatner's faux Shakespearian ham-fistedness (as much as I admire Shatner's Kirk) and givse this Kirk a much more nuanced approach.  He is the `coming of age' allegory of this film and its predecessor and by the end of the film he leaves you filled with a sense of forward-looking optimism for his potential for growth and maturity.  Though Pine does not deliver any particularly breathtaking or scene steeling moments, his even handed approach to introspection and impulsiveness both waging an internal conflict in the character is a tribute to thoughtful and meaningful character development.<br /><br />And while there are thoughts to share about each character, I'll focus the rest of my casting observations on the film's antagonist, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch).  I'll start by saying that he was not given a whole lot to work with.  The back story of his character seems rushed and not quite fleshed out.  But what Cumberbatch does with what he's given is nothing short of mesmerizing.  This man is an emotive and oratory juggernaut.  This is the man you want narrating your worst nightmare... or your funeral eulogy.  Cumberbatch's character is a swirl of relativistic ambiguity, internal turmoil, viscerally haunting anguish, and frightening ferocity... all delivered with a voice that commands that you listen.  You simply cannot dismiss this man, no matter how hard you try.  His character does have ties to former incarnations of Trek and while I have objections to Abrams choice to visit those particular threads of old guard continuity, Cumberbatch's performance stands entirely on its own merit and is deserving of nothing but praise.<br /><br />Second, this film is visually breathtaking while not overreaching.  I'll use Transformers as a point of comparison in that while ILM did some of their most technically complex and out of the box breakthrough work on those films,  for all of its reaching, the Transformers films were, in the words of the late Roger Ebert, \\"ugly films\\".  They were an assault on the senses actually.  After nearly three hours of nonstop CGI pummeling, the medium itself becomes completely meaningless as a story-telling device and your left with a painful, hollow film that literally leaves you sighing in relief when the end credits roll.  But while Star Trek is, by default, an effects heavy film, it manages to maintain its soul and substance over its style.  The set pieces and VFX shots are dazzling.They are used very effectively as mediums to communicate the optimism for humanity that is at the core of the message of Star Trek.  It is, quite simply, a visual feast and your home theater system will thank you in advance for ordering a Bluray copy and pushing that system to the limit!<br /><br />And finally, as I mentioned briefly in the opening of this review, the pacing of this film is nearly perfect.  I say nearly because I personally feel that this film (as well as many others) could benefit from a few more reflective moments that are not moving franticly from set to set.  But that is only a minor quibble that I feel does not detract from the sheer sense of enjoyment that you will experience when watching this film.  And again, the cast is to be credited with carrying this near pitch perfect pacing with the delivery of some of the best conversational interplay ever offered in any film or television version of Trek.  It's evident that these people have chemistry working together.  You believe these characters.  They `feel' genuine.  There were some truly delightful moments throughout the film that made me laugh, made me think, and made me feel.  J.J. Abrams has proven himself adept at balancing emotional `hues' and `tones' in his execution of this film.  I felt that I was `carried' through this film with equal parts mischievousness, thoughtfulness, brevity, and bombast.  While giving a respectful nod to Trek's penchant for pedantic stump-speaking, Abrams has made Trek thoroughly enjoyable to watch.  He has been able to carry many of the critical core elements of what makes Star Trek `Star Trek' over to this new vision of Trek and craft a resurrected franchise with international appeal.<br /><br />In the end, if you're lining this film up with the other 11 films and judging whether or not you should see it, it's a no brainer.  Star Trek: Into Darkness is a worthy entry into the franchise cannon and a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  Now Pre-order the Bluray and get out to the theater and enjoy yourself while you wait!
0307477479|3.0|This was actually an assignment for a book group, and I would not have chosen it to read otherwise.  There were numerous characters and scene switches, which made it a bit confusing. The outcome at end of book was of interest as it revealed the characters' who had awed thousands of fans and listeners settling into more ordinary lives with children and family, some of them suffering results of early involvement in drug/alcohol addictions.

Finally it arrived as promised and Armin did it again...  Armin_azing, Intens_ing, full of different nuances and sounds... from a violin that makes you shivering (track: Intense) to an incredible Heavenly state of trance (track:Last stop before Heaven) this album is a pure delight of moves and emotions... Mr. Van Buuren has the courage to surpass himself each time - he is not afraid to provide us with some new experiences... that take guts and courage... dedication... work... that is why he is a master of what he does and there is really no other whom can compare to him....

0385349831|5.0|If you are fumiliar with Paulo Coelho and his writings and like his books you will like this one also. It is words of wisdom. If you have ever studied the book of Proverbs or Sirach in the bible it is writen much like that. It is very inspiring words to live by, meditate and reflect upon. It is a book that you will want to read over and over again if you are wise. One example from the book... People always say: \\"It's inner beauty that matters, not outer beauty,\\" Well, thats not true. (The wise mans answers) If it were, why would flowers put so much energy into attracting bees? And why would raindrops transform themselves into a rainbow when they encounter the sun? Because nature longs for beauty, and its satisfied only when beauty can be exalted. Outer beauty is inner beauty made visible, and it manifests itself in the light that flows from our eyes.<br /><br />By reading this book You may see things in a different perspective in a new light. I find his books relate to the bible in one way or another.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I am a fan of Sanderson's work, but he can be a bit slow off the blocks. This book is no exception. It begins with a couple of exciting moments, but quickly falls into a lull. I was more than halfway through before I got to a point where I was reading for enjoyment rather than curiosity. Once it picks up steam the pacing gets better. Towards the end I didn't want to put it down. I'm looking forward to reading this series as it unfolds.

B007TKT2SK|5.0|I think it is one of the best apps ever offered. It allows you to calculate with fractions without converting them to decimals first. The number pad is divided into 3 sections. On the left keypad you enter whole numbers, on the upper right keypad you enter the numerator and lower left you enter the denominator. It displays the fraction as written, and the decimal equivalent above the fraction. The clear button erases the last entry made, and you can quickly edit by using the appropriate keypad. I will use it for sewing, cooking, woodworking, etc. No more converting to decimals, no more common denominators for me! The idea was genius, thank you Digitalcherry,LLC for bringing it to me!

0143034901|5.0|I can not say enough GREAT things about this book! I will not bore you with details so as not to give anything away. I will just say that this book draws you in from the first chapter, and takes you on an intriguing journey to the end. The author, Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n, has a beautiful way with words which makes this story flow like poetry. I feel sorry for the people who did not understand this book, hence giving it bad reviews, for they are truly the lost souls who will never get it. That being said, I am happy to see the majority of the people who did understand this book, give it the praise it truly deserves-- including Stephen King. This wonderful book is definitely a story worth investing in, and if I could give it more than five stars, I would surely do so.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|I watched this before I bought it, but it's such a good film and teaches you so much about how to be a Godly man that I needed to get it. If you haven't watched it before and are a Christian, this is a must have for you!

1476733953|1.0|What I found most upsetting about this book were the number of five star reviews that drew me right in.  The book is described as a future science fiction classic, a preposterous statement.  As other reviewers have noted, the author devotes more than the first 100 pages to the two main characters walking up and down a flight of stairs in a silo.  There is very little action, the characters are one dimensional and unexciting, and there is almost no plot development within the first 100 to 150 pages.  The other one star reviews on the site pretty much have it right.  Pass on this one and don't be drawn in, like I was, by the five star reviews.

B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This was an enjoyable, light read.  The plot was not terribly surprising but the author has a certain gift with words which made it more interesting.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is by far one of my favorites. I make it a point to thoroughly play any ge before I review it, so that Im sure it doesnt get worse or glitch out after a while. This game is still amazing, and I have played for 16+ hours so far. The game is a completely free-roam game (meaning you can pretty much do whatever), but there are missions and and story missions to do IF YOU WANT TO. One of the most appealing things is that you do not even have to play the story line. Although it does add to the game, it's completely unnecessary. Everything in the game can be earned through normal gameplay. Nothing needs to be purchased with real money, but it can be. Two more cool things: a complete, true skill tree (not just three or for unlinked skills) and the ability to unlock the black suit, which boosts your stats, along with making you look epic. My complaints: The graphics could definitely be better, but are decent. And also, when in mid- webswinging, occasionally the v-pad will move around, messing up your mid air control. All in all though, great game. Love the free roaming!
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I was excited to receive this dvd.  I wish I didn't have to purchase another dvd just to get the extended scenes, but it was worth it.  I like all the movies and am sad to see the saga end.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|The free version is much better than this. Waste of money. Less Blades and backgrounds to unlock, Isn't the 99 cent version supposed to be better than the free version?!!!? Here's a tip....... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I preordered the original Kindle Fire in 2010 and bought this case as soon as I received it. It has held up beautifully. My one complaint about the Fire is its weight when I put it in my purse, so this lightweight cover was essential for me. However, I made a mistake when I ordered it in white. The white side gets very dirty and it doesn't clean up.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Once again,,, the main characters are setup thoroughly, and from that point on, it is impossible to put this book aside for more than a day. As with Pillars of the earth, the reader goes on a historical journey but following several families and characters on a one to one basis, with all the advantages of fiction in the mix

1416511946|4.0|Very interesting read.  Essentially a year in the life of Nikki Sixx through his own lens in &#34;real-time&#34;, as well as the views of those around him at the same time.  Layered upon that are present-day reflections of Nikki and many of the same individuals, describing now what it was like back then relative to the specific stories and events.<br /><br />It's an amazing story about what we, the public, don't know or see - the life of a rock star at the very top of the world was at the same time as low as it could possibly be for him.  Not a pity story or a sympathy grab, just a very interesting, very matter of fact view of life as it was for this particular rock star.
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|I probably would have really liked this movie when I was fifteen. I imagine that kids and young adults are probably not bothered by the cheesy dialog and lame main character (who is as much of a whiner as Luke was in A New Hope). Overall, I am not terribly upset that I paid $3 to watch a barely-OK movie on a rainy day, but the ratings are terribly inflated (the fanboy-ism is strong with this one it seems), so don't get your hopes up.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|Watch the show! It is worth the time or money you'll spend and will make you wish you had watched this sooner. This is my favorite TV show i've seen and is a very unique \\"deserted island\\" themed show. Give me feedback, tell me if you agree.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I didn't know a series could leave me so tense and stressful after the 24 series ended, but this one did. After the sleepy second season on the farm, this season definitely made up for it. The Governor is a despicable character and pairs well as the antagonist to the righteous Rick. Would highly recommend!

B001XUPH9K|5.0|It was wonderful to see this movie presented in high definition.  Forget that it did not need to be cleaned up, as the story line and acting were both superb.  I know... Shatner and &#34;superb acting&#34; are rarely seen in the same sentence, but the entire cast was great!  Especially with Ricardo Mantalban reprising his role of Khan, from the original series Star Trek episode, &#34;Space Seed&#34;.  This movie is full of action, drama, suspence, and revenge!  For the many who have seen this movie, I don't need to review what you already know, except the remastering in HD!  For those of you who haven't seen it, you are missing out!  I hate spoiling a movie for anyone, so I will just say &#34;enjoy&#34;!
B00BKTWBMA|2.0|For me this album has very little blues let alone rock on it. This album has mainly a reggae feel with a hint of country. Not for me...
B0050DZN4K|4.0|This is a pretty good app. It does what it is supposed to. It makes your news feeds look like an online magazine with all the content specific to you. For me this is a plus and a minus. I appreciate the style and everything within the design. it handles well, is smooth and functions as it should. i just kind of prefer a plain rss reader like Google reader is/was. But i will continue using feedly. It is a very nice reader. I just need to get used to it.

B005XOPEOU|5.0|All I can say is this is by far my favorite Coldplay album. All the whiners complaining about audio distortion need to change the tubes in there 100 year old hifi tube amps and listen to this awesome album. Yes, it is loud, it is intense, but it is moving. Every track is powerful, and yes loud, but I think that it pushes you, motivates you, and inspires with the power behind the wall of sound that is this album. I think they had it mastered just how they wanted it, loud, powerful, and motivating. Dont let the so called hifi audio files ruin this for you, get it, you wont regret it!
B009AMANH4|5.0|Wonderful movie.  Daniel Day Lewis is so wonderful that you truly believe you are watching Lincoln in action.  His demeanor in the movie is spot one with all books I've read on Lincoln.

0307716554|3.0|I have to say I had high hopes for this book. The premise seemed interesting and at the start, it was intriguing. Having the main character trapped in a state between life and death and experiencing her out of body view of the world and people around her was unique...at first. Then it all kind of went to helland it got a little confusing with her always speaking to the husband. It was hard to keep track of who was talking to whom and who was where. SPOILER ALERT!! The book dragged on and some of the plot was ridiculous. The whole nonsense with the teacher and the jealous wife...ugh. And the last chapters droned on for so long I lost interest and couldn't wait for the plug to be pulled. It was depressing, and in the end, when we finally learn the culprit, was beyond silly. Afterwards? If only I had known beforehand!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I don't often leave a review but this one really deserves one.<br />I love books that build a story around real science. This one is fast paced, funny and leaves you to think that all of this could really happen this way.<br />Just couldn't put it down...it ended just right.. without too many or too little words.
B0085LMFAE|4.0|As a kid, I remember seeing the &#34;guy&#34; from the movie Vacation, and saying, &#34;who is that little guy?&#34; .  Paul Simons music from this album, which is a classic with musicians from Africa, to his movie/album of One Trick Pony I think is his best work.  The album takes me on a roller coaster of emotions and the times in life where MTV actually played music, not teen pregnancy shows.  It's an upbeat album, and the vocals of his back up singers are off the charts.  Check it out, put some money back into some &#34;good&#34; musicians pockets and sit back, and imagine being in a jeep, in Africa.... Awesome times.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I bought this after really enjoying &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; with Tom Cruise. Killing Floor is a great story, but I probably won't buy more of his books, because there was at least one really gruesome crime scene in there that was more graphic than I like to read. There are some images that I just don't want lingering in my mind! :s

B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was hysterical!  I loved how it was written from the man's point of view.  It had the perfect mix of romance and humor.  I can't wait for more books from Emma Chase!  This is definitely a must read.

B004ZGM76A|1.0|This isn't merely a case of style over substance, but rather all style and no substance. I can't imagine any intelligent viewer being entertained by this story (and I use that term loosely.) It's a mess that tries to make you forget it's a mess by jingling keys in front of your face with surreal visual effects. If you want a good special effects movie, there is no shortage of them out there, and virtually all of them have a better script, dialogue, and acting. I would understand people's fascination if this came out in say, 1990 when visual effects were at a turning point and people were doing things that had never been seen before. In 2011? I just don't understand what people see in it. An effect is a tool for telling a story, not a story itself.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I was skeptical about this book for the first couple of chapters; I'm so glad I persisted, because soon I couldn't put it down! I love how it is written in two voices. My loyalty to and sympathy for the characters kept changing. I found my self thinking about the story line when I wasn't reading, trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Some things I figured out (and felt very smart!), but there were surprises until the very end. Now that I know how it ended, I'll probably read it again and enjoy seeing how the pieces all fit together.
B002VCR08U|5.0|I am really enjoying this book.  The story is so personal from a passionate perspective.  The actual historical side is interesting as well.  It's everything I want in a good read!  I bought it for my mother, she has read it and thoroughly enjoyed 'Loving Frank' as well.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Who isn't at least tempted by all of the conspiracy theories revolving around Plum Island and other semi-secret places we all know a little bit about? This book was a tasty blend of action, suspense, interesting characters, lots of possible suspects, and a dash of romance. I certainly enjoyed the mix, and would look forward to picking up my Kindle at the end of the day to pick up where I left off with the mystery at hand. It was really quite satisfying!
193700788X|2.0|I, like many of you, am plenty.. disappointed by Dead Ever After. I could wrack my brain for all the philosophical and moral themes underpinning the series that I felt were let down by the overall ending, but it's far simpler to just flat out state my dissatisfaction.<br /><br />First off, I want to extend a congratulations to Charlaine Harris. (I'm not being sarcastic, just give me a moment.) She penned one of the most enchanting series I have read to date, blending a wide variety of mythos into a seamless, complex world full of danger, charm, and engaging imperfection. Each person was realistic, and, in their own ways, realistically flawed - which is especially fun if you like rich, complex characters. Sookie's world was faithfully and intriguingly crafted, and no matter how it ended, I would have been sad to see it go.<br /><br />Let's get the elephant out of the room: there was no way to end this book in a manner that was pleasing to all the fans. You know what I'm talking about. Either she would end up with Eric, or Bill, or Sam, or one of the many other fellows who had been courting her. It's been a little while since I read the rest of the series, but let me tell you I was sort of achey when I read the signs and figured out what was going on and what was going to happen. I won't say it's entirely \\"out of left field\\", nor will I claim that it was uncharacteristic for the couple to end up together, but I will say that it seemed like Charlaine was sort of shoving them together at the last possible minute, and it ended up reading like a sudden, slippery mess instead of the intensely subtle (or not so subtle) build ups that we'd seen in her other relationships. It didn't just leave something to be desired - it left me intensely unsatisfied and wishing that there had been something more in one of the other books - ANY of the other books - so I wouldn't feel like I was being so cheated, so that I might feel like this relationship was not only cliché and somewhat predictable, but RIGHT. This could have been achieved with more build up, but it was instead slapped together at the last possible second in order to secure something that was always hovering far in the background but never satisfyingly addressed. However, I will credit Charlaine Harris in that Sookie expressed that she could live without this (or any) romantic relationship and be fairly content in her life. She's strong, a survivor of horrible trials, and her will to live and be happy will not ever be more than momentarily dampened by the end of a romantic relationship. That, I admit I was pleased to see.<br /><br />On a personal note (SPOILERS)... I was exceptionally disappointed that she didn't end up with a vampire, since their world is so complex, fascinating, and that was how everything started - with a single, gentlemanly vampire. The vampires have featured so prominently throughout the entire series, it seems like a horrible shame for her to have concluded with a book that was basically devoid of them entirely (END spoilers).<br /><br />The writing itself was bland. There were odd plots that tied hastily together without ever being fully or adequately explored. It was written in a way that felt too \\"realistic\\", like the enchantment that had hooked me and many others on the series had completely gone out of it. The book was so short I read it within two days, and I kept waiting for something to happen. It never did, at least not for me.<br /><br />There was a lot of attempting to tie up loose ends: mostly by (minor spoilers) blatantly killing people who weren't fond of Sookie and by pairing up (or insinuation of pairing up) every single romantic interest she's ever had to ensure each had their own `happy ending'. As for the en masse murders of the I-Hate-Sookie club, it seems every person in the world who wanted to see her dead convened on Sookie all at once and were all more or less neatly and rather conveniently killed (end minor spoilers). Additionally, plots that had been staged in the second last book were rolled over and snapped shut in so terse and flat a manner that it was incredibly hard to swallow... here's where that \\"it was written too realistically\\" part stands out the heaviest. The way that arc was taken care of may have been \\"realistic\\", but it was hellishly unsatisfying to swallow as a reader.<br /><br />I want to think all of this was kind of like extending an olive branch to both the fans and characters: Sookie is safe! Everyone will end up happy (or as happy as they can manage)! but in many ways it fell seriously short. I read the foreward with a warning tugging at my brain - and having read the book, I now know why. \\"There isn't a way I could make all of you happy with the ending of the series, and so I've followed my own plan, the one I've had all along, and I hope you agree that it's fitting.\\" It was that last part that triggered me - the hope that we thought she was doing her own series justice. I'm sorry to say that I feel she did not.<br /><br />I like to imagine that Sookie would live a full life, a happy life - and maybe she's actually tired of all the intrigue and constant danger, not to mention the fact that she's been hurt (emotionally and physically) countless times, and that her friends have been in danger and been hurt too. And maybe, yes, she is tired of the supernatural world. Maybe she would genuinely want to give it a rest: be away from the weres, the vamps, the fae. Maybe even for the rest of her life, as the book seems to suggest.<br /><br />On one hand I agree with the author... Sookie has had enough adventure, seen enough death and enough magic to last her entire lifetime and then some. But... it's so hard to envision her being content after all of that, to simply leave it all behind for good. If anything, Sookie had been exposed to marvellous worlds full of creatures and cultures that were both dark and fantastic, giving her perspective and world a depth that she could have scarcely imagined before she met her first vampire. Simply put, and disregarding everything else, it just seems sad for her to let all of that slip away.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book carries you along with growing interest in the characters and a continually building suspense that makes the reader want to know what will happen next. The characters are strong enough so as not to be lost in a plethora of faceless names.I am new to Grisham! - maybe the last reader in America to have gotten on board, but now that I'm there, I'll be sure to re-visit this author time and time again.

B007SGM084|4.0|While the title of my review tells it all, the book does have its flaws. The writing is terrible. It sounds like it's written by a teenager. The characters are unbelievable as, well as the context. A gorgeous 28 year old billionaire, with a deviant sexual side, who is an accomplished pianist, flyer and angler falling for an innocent college girl who knows nothing of the world, much less his world. She doen't even run in the same circles socially. Her biggest accomplishment is that she graduated college with staight A's, got a 2120 on her SAT and held a part-time job at a hardware store. This doesn't happen in real life. The constant use of the words, \\"Jeez\\" and \\"Holy Crap\\" resound through out the book. If someone rolled there eyes in the book one more time, I thought I was going to scream. For a young woman, who was a virgin, she orgamsims at the drop of a hat. The description of the characters facial experessions were constant... blushing crimson, his eyes were literally shades of gray depending on his mood. At first the sexually explict scenes were needed to set the plot of the story but after that it just became gratuitous sex. I'm not a prude but I could have done without every other page being a sex scene. The ending of the trilogy was unbelievable but expected. This trilogy could have honestly could have been two books at best or one long book. Many of the sub-plots could have been eliminated since they did not enchance the book. Now the plus side. I was probably drawn in to the darker sexual scenes. It was truely interesting how much I learned. I actually had to Google some of the items to understand what was happening in the book since this lifestyle was foreign to me. I think reading about this lifestyle and wondering what would happen next was what made it a page turner for me. Also my couriosity for what made this a runaway book and dubbed \\"housewives porn\\". I'm glad I read the triology over a rainy weekend. I don't feel like I wasted for doing this. Also, I waited for all the hype to die down and read it on my Kindle and bought each book as a special, therefore, I did not pay top dollar., I waited for all the hype to die down and read it on my Kindle and bought each book as a special, therefore, I did not pay top dollar.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|I loved this film.  It is an exact account of what was really happening in our government in a time when citizens needed to know the truth about how bad it can get when unchecked and misused.  I am forever grateful for all the information that our press and media are able to give to those of us who search for real answers to difficult questions.  The DVD arrived in first rate condition and will be forever in my collection to pass on to family.

0978545095|5.0|This second book of the late Vivian Maier's almost lost work is even stronger overall than \\"Street Photographer.\\" That book is a strong, vivid, impressive, lovely book. The images are those things, and the book is well made and printed, with quite useful text commentary (not always the case in photobooks). \\"Out of the Shadows\\" is all that and more. This book shows both a wider range of Maier's interests and concerns, and a greater quantity of them, and the book itself is of outstanding production quality in every particular, most especially the plates themselves, which have just gorgeous tonality and frequently a sense of depth quite apart from ordinary depth of field, almost like daguerrotype.<br /><br />It is a lot of fun to see a photographer's career laid out retrospectively all at once, as we have had the privilege with Maier, and shall continue to, as other arrangements of her large and increasingly wide-ranging legacy are published (and at some point, a major public exhibition). All the echoes of Helen Levitt, Garry Winogrand, Arthur Tress, Lisette Model, Walker Evans, even Diane Arbus tease and insist on the questions of how much of these or other photographers' work she knew,  how well, and what she thought of it. I'll leave to others the hyperbole and over-excitement that often has surrounded Maier in the three years since the work went public, except to say that it is easy to go there. Vivian Maier (oh, here I go now) is in some real respect a photographic Emily Dickinson (and as tough-minded and funny at points as Dickinson, as well as reclusive and lacking self-confidence). This is a photobook I know I will come to regard ever more highly, among the nearly 150 already in my library, and Maier's 'career' isn't yet over, not for us who have had the almost dumb luck to find her just in time.*<br /><br />*just in time for us, regrettably not in time for Maier herself. . .

B0077ATSZE|5.0|The only movie publicity we see these days is for silly, noisy movies made from comic books. So this one slipped right past me until recently. If you're past the raging hormone stage of life, you'll find this immensely satisfying. Oskar, a bright boy with probable Aspergers, loses his father in the 9/11 attack.  He finds a key among his father's possessions and begins a quest to find the lock.  He's more than smart enough to invent a feasible plan, but he has no ability to handle the deep emotional scars left by his father's death.<br /><br />As great as this story is, this movie isn't about plot so much as it's about people and the way they treat each other.  The part of Oskar is taken by first-timer Thomas Horn, and I've never seen a better performance by a young person. He brings both vulnerability and the focused ability to irritate that so many Asperger's kids must learn to handle.  Every part, large or small, is perfectly cast.  From Sandra Bullock's distraught mother (with a surprise of her own) to John Goodman's doorman to Jeffrey Wright's estranged husband, this film is pitch-perfect.  It's impossible to watch without your own emotional response, but it doesn't feel manipulative.  With news crews finally moved on to the next tragedy, we're able to see the blow that 9/11 was to New Yorkers.  I couldn't help but think of the many families who are still dealing with the giant holes this left in their lives.<br /><br />Find a couple of quiet hours and watch this film through.  It's both sobering and satisfying.
B00C2VGAW2|2.0|I recently saw the movie with a group of family & friends. We all loved the movie, and we all agreed the music that was featured was a big dissapointment.<br />Rap music in the 1920s?<br /><br />I'm sure these are all great songs, but it didn't fit with the movie. Think about it, it would be the same as substituting all the music with Head-banger songs (Metallica, Slayer, Rage against the machine, etc.)<br /><br />Great movie, but bad soundtrack.

To be honest the whole time I was reading I had to keep reminding myself that this was a Sookie book because everyone just seemed oddly out of character. It's obvious CH is just over this series, because it seems like she tried her best to force a plot that we've seen before. It just makes me sad because I have been a fan for so many years, before True Blood even, and to see it end like this was just depressing.

0374533571|5.0|Silver Linings Playbook  Post Tramatic Stress Disorder Bipolar OCD    Finally a movie that touches on what mental illness such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Bi-polar, and OCD looks and feels like.    Last week I attended a presentation by NAMI Stand Up Against Stigma is the National Alliance for Mental Illness statement for May Mental Health Awareness Month.    The first day Silver Lining came out was I think the same day.  I really wasn't sure what the movie was about but as I watched it, I was overwhelmed with emotion as I yelled and cried out FINALLY a movie to help us with Mental Illness be understood and hopefully accepted back into society without prejudice.    Then on Saturday, I received my NAMI magazine and they have a full article about the movie.  Wow someone is reaching out to me to push forward with my book because it is very timely and further illustrates what it is like to have PTSD, Conversion and Somatization disorders.    In Silver Linings Playbook: Movie Trailer [...]  Pat Solatano- a man with Bi-polar and PTSD.    The Movie illustrates:    *The challenges of coming home after a hospital stay.  His wife was caught having an affair and he beat the man severely.  *How people in the small town react to him with prejudice and are terrified of him because they know what he did.  *Behaviors that are routine and comforting to Pat but are abnormal to others; example, wears a garbage bag while running because he sweats.  *How up and down emotions are high and lows, etc  *Shows how Pat's hearing is affected when he hears a song that isn't playing because of the trauma he experienced with his wife's affair.  *Others with mental illness accept each other and can be the biggest help to overcome challenges.  Society Non - Acceptance = Mental Illness Stigma    Peer to Peer Support = Acceptance, Encouragement, True Friendship    Jennifer Lawrence- a woman with depression and challenges of being known as the town slut. Pat exhibits concern, encouragement andis protective of her when men approach her house and in society, because of her prior reputation. She helps Pat to overcome his challenges and to get his life back together and in the process she accepts him for who he is regardless of his mental illness.    Robert De Niro is the father with Obsessive Compulsion Disorder it shows how his disorder affects his family relationships, money situation because of superstitions while betting on football games, again a routine that makes him feel safe and that all is right in his world.  Also shows how one family member with mental illness can trigger another family with mental illness and how it causes chaos in the house.    Book Cover  Flashbacks in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Surviving the Flood does this very thing by describing in detail what it is like to have distressing flashbacks, body memories, sensitivity to sound, smell, touch, and leaving reality to go to the past as triggers arise in everyday tasks and environment. Also, how upsetting it is for a patient to have to accept medications when it is their only choice to control their diagnoses. It also illustrates in detail what therapy looks and feels like, as the little girl switches ego-states, while going through the process of healing.  It also shows the transition from a hospital stay to home life and the judgement of people who know that you were in the hospital.    After reading this book, you will have a road map back to sanity while making new trusting relationships with people you chose to be a part of your healing journey.    Anyone affected by mental illness will be able utilize the steps in this book to assist loved ones in finding the path to their unique healing journey.

B002QRWJA4|5.0|A gala for the eyes! My husband and I consider this movie as one of our favorites ever. If you can get a husband who whines about  having to see &#34;chick flicks&#34; to love this movie--- that tells you that you must see it!

0307887448|5.0|I met a man while at thee hospital, and as he lay in his bed before his post-op physical therapy he sat in his bed and read this book: \\"Ready Player One\\". Being one who literally judges all the books I read by the cover (both the outside artwork and the inside description), I asked him about the novel. He shared with me the a general summary and his love of his ability to relate to the book, because he grew up in the time. As I read this book on my own later, I couldn't help but think constantly of how I wished I knew more about 80's pop culture. The thing about Ernest Cline's novel though is that...it doesn't matter. ANY gamer can find himself of herself able to totally relate to the characters because, they are gamers as well. I think that is something that transcends the generation difference, and even if it doesn't Cline provides a nice description of a lot of the references. A very nice book.
B007HLIUN4|5.0|By going back into history and working forward to the present day, the author has identified some universal mechanisms which underlie the economic, political and social aspects of our lives. This allows us (if we wish) to formulate policies and behaviours independent of the prejudices and self-serving attitudes which govern much of our political, academic and commercial activity.<br />An admirable book and an absolutely absorbing read.

It is easy to understand and really makes me look at my life and my thoughts. I am really trying to practice the principles from this book in my life. I highly recommend this book!
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|I think you can get it to do more.  It's cute for kids, and I enjoyed looking at it, but I wouldn't invest in getting further additions to it as I don't see my Grandchildren often enough for them to enjoy it, as they live across the country. But probably great if you have young children!
B00555X8OA|5.0|The Slow Movement faces down the contemporary imperative for speed thinking. Speed thinking is, to me, lazy person's thinking; slow thinking takes a lot work and time. I could stand to slow down, in my approach to problems and situations.

1400069742|5.0|Lynne Olson's well written survey of the events of 1939 through 1941 was stirring and meaningful to me on a very personal level.  I have read Troublesome Young Men twice and was anticipating an history of events in a similar remote vein.  I was not at all prepared for the extent to which her narrative spoke to me as it relates events and people who were present in my life in some way.  Although I was born after the War, my household reverberated with conversations about the personages who filled this valuable and informative book and helped me piece those people and events together. My parents has a large volume by William Allen White in their libabary. I had always wondered why it was there and why he was important to them.  As I read futher, being a Yale graduate in the days of Kingman Brewster, the personal connections for me in her history seemed never to end.  In chapter after chapter, Olson demonstated how the events and personalities of one generation flow forward to the next several generations.  Surely, this is the point of reading history.<br /><br />At the same time, it is clear that Ms. Olson is providing our nation today with object lessons about the futility of relying on a national government or political leadership alone to address our nation's problems.  Whether focusing on interventionists or isolationists, she paints a picture of a nation engaged--of people working daily, at great personal and individual cost but without purpose of indivudal advancement, to generate and participate in democratic processes of monumental importance.  The nation she paints at first seems a distant universe from the nation we inhabit today, but, gradually, the reader begins to understand that the immensity of the challenges of the early 1940's were far greater than the daily drama Washington and the political media feed us today.  So her book becomes a stirring call to action.  It paints a shining example of how this nation--seemingly hopelessly divided on the issue of whether to go to war against Nazi Germany, an issue which in historical hindsight seems so elementary as to be a simplistic choice--can resurrect its focus on purpose and accomplishment.<br /><br />Lastly, whether intended or not, Ms. Olson's survey describes in great detail the workings of the three branches of the federal government within the structure of the Constitution.  In this day and age when schools omit civic courses and many Americans do not accurately understand the intended role and function of the Supreme Court, the Congress and its committees, the Presidency and Cabinet Departments, this book is essential.<br /><br />Ms. Olson has performed a great service for this country by bringing her focus from Great Britain and its travails in the pre-War period back to the United States.  I look forward to her next book.

B00336C3EY|5.0|Over the years I have enjoyed re-watching this marvelous movie; it never ceases to captivate and inspire more essential questions. The comedy is subtle, witty. Every actor delivers a pitch-perfect performance--especially those who play Larry Gopnik and his wife. And I must confess, Larry's meetings with the first two rabbis were a more accurate portrayal of such conversations than I would care to admit. It does help to be Jewish to get the full value of this film. It's just a mind-set, I guess...
030758836X|3.0|I've just finished this book.

B0045HCJ94|5.0|It is difficult to believe that it has been 50 years since Edward Albee's 1963 eviscerating play `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Open on Broadway, and even more difficult to realize that three years later, in 1966, this cinematic version, with a screenplay by Ernest Lehman and directed brilliantly by Mike Nichols brought to the public's attention the special gifts of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as the alcoholic couple. It is a remarkable film and one that seems equally fine when we return to the DVD version so many years later.<br /><br />George and Martha are a middle aged married couple, whose charged relationship is defined by vitriolic verbal battles, which underlies what seems like an emotional dependence upon each other. This verbal abuse is fueled by an excessive consumption of alcohol. George being an associate History professor in a New Carthage university where Martha's father is the President adds an extra dimension to their relationship. Late one Saturday evening after a faculty mixer, Martha invites Nick and Honey, an ambitious young Biology professor new to the university and his mousy wife, over for a nightcap. As the evening progresses, Nick and Honey, plied with more alcohol, get caught up in George and Martha's games of needing to hurt each other and everyone around them. The ultimate abuse comes in the form of talk of George and Martha's unseen sixteen year old son, whose birthday is the following day. That final moment, captured by Haskell Wexler's bracing black and white cinematography and underlined by Alex North's musical scoring, when the title of the play is asked by George in question from to the devastated Martha and she answers `I am' is a moment of cinematic history that deserves celebrating.<br /><br />Times change and films change and the public seems more interested in massive superhero explosive 3D extravaganzas to avoid the doings of the time. But films such as this remind us how powerful small ensemble screen acting can be. This is not an escapist outing, this is an examination of how people act to influence, enhance and destroy each other.  It demands we think as well as react. Grady Harp, May 13.

0307477479|4.0|A wonderfully well written book, fun and fast paced, a pleasure to read. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I didn't love the unique chapter written in a sort of flash card style. In fact, as I read said chapter, I expected to dislike the entire portion of the book taking place in the 2020s, but then I loved the New York Scotty concert chapter in which Egan portrays Alex's reluctant decision to sell out. I loved the way she describes the state of things - new marketing ethics (or lack thereof) and the shunning of old world morality. And it's fun how she brings back Lulu, what a great character. This is a daring and very original book.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Excellent film and an excellent origin story, a fantastic addition to the X-Men franchise.<br />The cast were brilliant and the SPFX were top notch. Thoroughly enjoyed watching this<br />and glad I bought it for my collection

B00AAQWMB4|4.0|I have played the board game many times so I already knew how to play. It is a little difficult to understand how to mirror pieces and turn them but once you read the help menu it is easy to learn. I loved it and got very addicted to it. Beat the computers all the way to level 4. You must go into the settings and increase the level manually as you improve.
B005AUWY90|4.0|This movie was not as good as the original in the sense that when my son(3yrs) watched it<br />it was too busy and complicated for him to take in and he soon got bored unlike the original<br /> that brings a smile to his face every time. I enjoyed it because a good spy spoof done properly<br /> is always good, and this is well made. It was especially enjoyable to see references to the<br />James Bond movies and Sir Michael Cain was perfectly cast as was Eddie Izzard.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|Don't know if I can say I like this one better than the USA remake, but both have really good features and nice settings. Video and Audio quality are superb and it even has some nice special features.

0345529057|5.0|I began watching the Game of Thrones show on HBO since season 1. Right of the bat, I loved the story line and decided to read the books even though I've seen all the episodes. One major reason I enjoy the novels is because of the many characters that are involved. Second, everyone has an uncertain fate when trying to reach the throne, which makes you want to read more.
B001DRF84W|4.0|I enjoyed this movie but thought the story was stunted and should have spread out more.<br />It was good to see the Hulk jump massive distances and throw and smash tanks like he did<br /> in the 60's cartoon.Eric Bana did a fine job and I feel he could have done the second movie as well.

B000W23KHQ|5.0|This THE classic album by the Velvet Underground. Warhol and Nico working together with the Velvet Underground. A seminal work with Lou Reed, John Cale, Nico, Sterling Morrison, and Maureen Tucker. Standouts include I'm Waiting for the Man, Venus and Furs, Heroin, I'll be Your Mirror. There is more here than meets the ears on first listen. This recording is like a fine wine in that it takes time to appreciate. It is not the typical bang you over the head recording we've become so used to these days. Nor is it the usual &#34;Alternative Music&#34; genre type of recording that has become so predictable. This is something else. Something truly Avant Garde. Own it!
B009QBRVZG|5.0|A lot of the reviews are dated before the retail cd came out ( which seems to only be available through kos) ..the retail cd is pretty awesome to me ( barring the changed intro to born in a grave) plus added eric vocals, better endings n more guitar solos make this cd rock to me...I also enjoyed the change of pace from all the odin stuff myself.  I trashed the underproduced hammer cd when it came out now I regret all I said...I'm betting a lot of people feel the same
B003Y3AZSW|1.0|I had this delivered three times. each time the plastic base of the case was cracked.  I gave up and cancelled order.  What a waste of effort; shipping was free to me but must have cost someone a lot of money.  No one watching the controls here.  Asleep at the wheel-- so to speak!<br /><br />Too bad as it probably would have been a good product.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|Anyone who claims this movie is good or full of action needs to stop writing reviews and keep their opinions to themselves. The movies finds Detective Mclane traveling to Russia to locate his son who is on trial for a crime he committed. You may find yourself confused due to a lack of information surrounding the weak plot. The acting is horrendous. Jai Courtney who plays Bruce Willis son makes Channing Tatum look  like Daniel Day Lewis. John Mclaine is not the same character he was in the previous Die Hard films and you will notice he seems a bit softer. There are a few funny one liners but its pretty much corny dialogue with a weak script. The enemies are not memorable and their is not much action taking place. There are a few decent action pieces but other then that you may find yourself bored out of your mind if you are an action junky. If you do decide to watch this film just be aware of what to expect. The film has received low ratings for a reason. The website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 15% rating based on critic reviews and it holds a 48% rating based on reviews left by audience members such as ourselves. On the website IMDB the film holds a 5.6 out of 10 with many of the reviews not exceeding a 5 star rating. And of course Amazon users have rated the film poorly as you can tell by the mediocre 2 and half star rating. Surprisingly the film grossed over 300,000,000 million dollars worldwide. HOWEVER, only a little over $62,000,000 dollars came from the United States. Thanks to the international audiences the film did exceed its budget but if it was just shown in the United States it would have been a box office failure.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|They  could have hacked 40 minutes and made this much better.  If this were , say,  \\"The Godfather\\" it may merit the length.  But Apatow? Come on.  The funniest stuff is in the trailer and is, oddly, trimmed from the film.  Pass.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|I mean, it's The Sound of Music.  Arrived timely, good price. If you love the movie there is nothing more to say.
B000002H48|3.0|The (likely misguided) politics of the event aside, the music here is a big-time mixed bag. Virtually every listener will find things they like and things they don't like, and everyone's lists will be different. Going through it recently, I found that there are 17 tracks I will listen to and 10 I won't. The most common reason for my not wanting to listen is the unpleasant-sounding voices of the singers. Seriously, how did some of these artists get to be well-known and popular if this is how their live singing sounded? (A different category of &#34;unpleasant-sounding voices&#34; occurs on the almost amusingly out-of-tune &#34;You Don't Have To Cry&#34; by CS&N.) A few other tracks have lyrics that rub me seriously the wrong way (for example, Graham Nash's offensive &#34;Cathedral&#34;) but this probably won't be an issue for most other listeners.  Most of the performances seem to stand up well against the original studio versions (where applicable), with a few minor exceptions. David Crosby seems to be tired of singing &#34;Long Time Gone&#34; and tries to make it &#34;different&#34;; Nicolette Larson sounds a bit hoarse on &#34;Lotta Love&#34;; Jesse Colin Young seems to have forgotten that &#34;Get Together&#34; has an actual melody.  Notes on a couple of songs that you probably won't hear anywhere but here: &#34;The Crow on the Cradle&#34; - A 1960s folk song mostly performed by Jackson Browne, this is a heavy anti-war piece that will stick in your mind and chill your bones regardless of your feelings on the subject. The violin is especially haunting. &#34;Power&#34; - Performed by The Doobie Brothers with James Taylor, this is actually a song by singer/activist/politician John Hall (who also contributes the annoying &#34;Plutonium is Forever&#34;). Not a great song by any means, but it does show that even the most obnoxiously heavy-handed message can be delivered with a measure of poetic grace.  Anyway, I would recommend this collection only to those who are faithful fans of one or more of the artists represented. In listening to the tracks by the other artists, you may discover some other things you like. Or not.
1594744769|4.0|This was a book I have wanted to read for a long time.  I finally got around to reading it, it was just as fantastically quirky I had hoped.  It was a fun and mysterious read, also a little bit creepy at parts.<br /><br />After the horrific death of Jacob's grandfather, Jacob slumps into a deep depression.  It's determined that the only way to get Jacob out of this slump is for him to journey to the mysterious island that his grandfather grew up on.  Jacob and his father journey to a remote island off of the coast of Wales.  There Jacob investigates a peculiar children's home that his grandfather grew up in.  Jacob's only clues are some mysterious pictures his grandfather left him and a peculiar note.<br /><br />This was a fun and quirky read.  It's mainly a mystery about a young man trying to solve his grandfather's mysterious past....along the way he discovers children with strange powers, time travel, and evil monsters.<br /><br />Jacob is an okay lead character.  He is mainly characterized by his obsession to find out what really happened to his grandfather.  Other than that, he wasn't a real distinctive character for me.<br /><br />What really drives this story is the mystery behind Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.  The mystery unravels deliberately and things get more and more complex as Jacob unravels more and more secrets on this remote Wales island.<br /><br />I am not going to get a lot more into the story beyond that because I don't want to spoil anything.  Let's just say that through some quirks in time, all of these peculiar children that Jacob is so fascinated by may still be alive.<br /><br />Of course a big draw for this book are all of the strange pictures throughout.  I really enjoyed their addition to the story, they made the peculiar children all that more real to the reader.  The fact that these are all actually real vintage pictures found in old picture collections makes this book even more unique and special.<br /><br />The book was well written, engaging, and easy to read.  What really drives the story is the mystery and what makes it enjoyable are the quirky pictures throughout.  The main story is wrapped up pretty well, but there are things left unanswered for future books in the series.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this book.  It's a very creative idea and implemented very well.  The mystery is what drives the story and the pictures are fascinating and interesting.  Jacob as a character could have used a bit more depth, but that really isn't what this book is about.  I am curious to see what the second book in this series will be about.  I recommend this to those who are interested in a YA mystery read with fantasy overtones to it that's a bit different than anything else out there.s well written, engaging, and easy to read.

B00BSW6F26|2.0|Very disappointing. This clue finding game has no real puzzle challenges. Although free from object finding pictures, the map pieces are a random find on the dark scenes within my 10 inch tablet screen. Can't imagine how you would play this on smaller screens. Just not designed for tablets and phones.  Completed and deleted.  Poor show.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|I didn't think this was going to be an Oscar-caliber movie, and it's not, but that doesn't mean it's not a fun movie. It's based on a very popular \\"jukebox musical\\" and tells the story of Sherrie and Drew, and their romance amid the hair metal glam of the Sunset Strip of the mid-80s. Set against the backdrop of the Bourbon Room, and featuring performances by Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin, Mary J. Blige, and, in a wierd casting move that somehow works for this movie, Tom Cruise as a washed-up rocker.<br /><br />OK, it's not exactly a documentary on the music of the late 80s, but this type of musical was always intended to pay tribute to the music, not follow national events exactly as they were.  And it is a fun story: Sherrie and Drew meet when she comes to LA and gets a job at the Bourbon Room, a dive bar owned by a washed-up rocker. Stacee Jaxx is set to play a show there, his last with his band because he is so difficult to work with, and everyone is excited, except the mayor's wife, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, who starts a crusade against Stacee and the bar, ostensibly to clean up the area, but also to be able to sell the land to developers. The night of the show, events conspire that end up breaking up Stacee and Drew and shocking Stacee out of his selfish stupor. Will they realize their rock and roll dreams or is it one last round at the Bourbon?<br /><br />I can't help but like this movie, but maybe because I'm a fan of musical theatre, and I know how these tribute musicals work. It was fun for me to remember the songs that the writers used to enhance the story. And I enjoyed the performances.  Russell Brand was funny, in a way he usually is not. Julianne Hough was amazing, and the male lead was astoundingly attractive!  Mary J Blige as the owner of the strip club was wonderful in her role, and I have to say Tom Cruise, once you got over the shock that he is actually singing, was really good. It felt like we were remembering the best parts of the metal scene, looking back fondly 25 years out. And the version of \\"Don't Stop Believing\\" is incredible!<br /><br />There is a lot of sexuality, so this is not a musical for children to watch, but I think, if you loved the 80s and that kind of music, this is a great, fun movie to watch.

B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This one has always been one of my favorite movies, beautiful story about such a great man.  Giacomo did such a wonderful job as Karol.  Just wonderful, if there were more stars I'd put 10.
1455526959|4.0|This is one of Connely's better works.  It keeps you engaged and is hard to put down. I recommend it.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Huge fan now, I'm a little late but so happy to have finally given in to to this Series, cant wait for season 4 comes out
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|To have never had to deal with anything like this but to still feel the entirety of it through words is a beautiful thing. This book is many things at once, which leaves the reader feeling - just feeling it all, and that's the mark of a well-told story. It had me laughing and crying and then laughing through my tears. There are some lines I had to highlight and which I will carry with me going forward.
0385535147|5.0|Another well written and entertaining legal thriller<br />by the masterful author of several best selling works.<br />I have yet to find a poorly written story by this author.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Season 7 returns to the tension and excitement level of the first two seasons by upping the ante. Once again Dexter is exposed to someone he loves and is never more than a minute away from being caught. No more philosophizing, just straight up nail biting suspense. Much more entertaining than previous seasons. Then again, we are all guilty for liking a show about a lovable serial killer.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I love playing this on my Kindle Fire HD. I wish or wouldn't take so long to save to builders my suits. But I refuse to pay for in game content. Loving it though.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|Beautiful man, wonderful talent, great songs!  He lives on through his music.  I also purchased Cloud Nine and it, too, is very enjoyable.
B007L6VR12|5.0|i hated the Life Aquatic and loved Rushmore, and somewhere in the middle of this movie i realized that i not only liked this film, i loved it, and not only did i love it i would put it in my top 10 films of all time. I don't really know it just felt magical, and the two child leads were amazing playing against each other, sure it was quirky and felt like most of Wes Andersons films but it also had someone that most movies are missing, a sense of itself and where it was going.<br /><br />if you hyavent seen it yet give it a chance
B001F4UHGC|5.0|San Francisco at its gritty best and certainly one of the best car chases of all time. A must view of a classic.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Wish it had  motion<br />Loads faster. Than e net like it a lot  Good going keep the good work on here
B000004286|5.0|This is truly a beautiful soundtrack.  However, it is a bit mournful.  That aside, it wonderful!<br /><br />I enjoy every track on the disc, I don't think there is one that I actual hate.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|Its a good movie, but I had got the notion that it was to be about the tiger, not the guy. I also felt that Pi  was a hit and miss about his life. Also the ending was not as good as I thought it should of been, did the tiger live or die?
B000002OR4|5.0|It's a pretty soundtrack but don't listen to it on your bad day...  I love history and music, so this is a great combo.<br /><br />This is based on a true story and is worth seeing, it's amazing how Schindler rescued all of those people!  A True Miracle.
B000002GB9|5.0|I love Styx and Grand Illusion is one of their best CD's!  If you love Styx then you definitely need to get this CD.
B004TI1WME|4.0|This app works well and focuses on the functions that are best suited in a business / accounting environment. Well laid out, it is easy to enter and manipulate. I especially appreciate the simple % functions which are very intuitive. I was able to download this as a free app of the day and am unsure that I would have purchased it since I no longer use this type of calculator on a regular basis. It is nice to have as a secondary utility along with RealCalc, a scientific calculator available at the other store. My &#34;go to&#34; choice on my home screen is still another free app called MobiCalc.
B00170MYIS|5.0|By having an extra battery charged and ready to go was important to me. I was on a long trip  and wanted my camera to be ready when I needed it.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Love Jonathan R Meyers. I had to look up the original story and picture of King Henry v111.  Very well done.
B00B0D29E6|4.0|I was sure I had bought this album back in the day when it was released in vinyl, but could not find it in my collection. The cd is most likely better quality anyway. I have always liked Deep Purple and was glad to be able to listen to their classics again. Top quality disc, I recommend it to all who like to rock.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Enjoying this app so very much ^^ still trying to figure out the way the friends interact, so please FRIEND me and show me the way ~.^
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really makes you think and truly work your mind. I have enjoyed this game and hope to find more just like it so I keep the challenges coming.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|This is just one of those extra things I thought I needed. Really didn't need or use this as much as I thought I would. Seems well made and is easy to use though. If you like having the extra gadgets then this is for you.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a great story, leading into a wonderful series that leads you on a fanciful ride. What if the Gods and Goddess were real?
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app has really saved me during some long boring business trips. Never freezes up and very easy to navigate.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love angry birds, and Star Wars... The whole game is hilarious. Graphics are excellent, easy to use and so challenging...
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy to navigate and I've never had it freeze up on me. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Okay. I really did not like this book. Oh, it's well written and all, but I did not like the way it ended. I really wanted this whole Hunger Games Trilogy to end a little more up beat than this. Sorry...I like happier endings. Love the character of Katness, but not Peta. Still, I'm glad I have this set of books in my Kindle. I will read them again and perhaps grow to like this third book. It may take awhile.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|It's a little difficult to navigate on this app. I don't even use it anymore. I wouldn't recommend this app.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Having read part two of The Hunger Games series, I can honestly say, I like the book, but I don't love it. I have a feeling that I'm not going to like part three. Not sure I like the direction this story is going. Still, it's a good book and I will read it several times.
B00BJG7H3M|3.0|If we want to be sure that we are really objective, we have to separate the parts for this show. The producers have used extremely tailored and already pretested techniques in order to get the public to like a show that in some way it is magnificent but the poorness of the glass ceiling that the producers have self-imposed, makes it a show that is not as good as it looks like.<br />  Cinematography, casting, acting, direction and many other aspects, are just superb, so what is the problem? In order to find out, just ask yourself some questions. What is a client for this kind of sitcom looking for that they cannot get any were else, soap opera cheesiness?, legal action and argumentation with all the thrilling techniques that come with it? I would say that they are looking for what the sitcom itself gives as a proposition from the first chapters, namely, a very good exhibition of intelligent responses, that look much more natural to real life than those theatrical performs were people yells to one another, threaten, talks like they are on amphetamines as they are walking away or passing by. Really? Is that what we see in our offices or places or work environments? Anyone who behaves like  that will be accused of incompetence harassment and verbal abuse or any other, notwithstanding that the job just can't be done in that way. The people who it is supposed to be their public, are all those that know how to read and write or think and that have been abandoned for the sake of pleasing the gullible masses, but now the tables have been turning around for some time, many producers have realized of that. \\"The practice\\" was a very good competent show that still was able to please the crowd without treasoning the intelligent and educated minded. So is \\"White collar though it has quite a bit more of soap opera cheesiness, but it keeps a very fine and tolerable balance. For the last years, the public has been responding very well to those more solid shows that are closer to theliterature lovers and so are the producers, but they still do not trust themselves enough, they are afraid that they will not get the response expected, but I say that at least they will get a trustable crowd of faithful followers, people like me that once we see just one show that has this kind of flavor, will Google the name of the writers and follow through different series, that will immediately drop a show that tries to manipulate us with empty formulaic scripts. We recognize every single piece we see in these shows that it is borrowing from previous ones. We the real fans remember scenes or situations that may come as far as from Bonanza or 77 sunset strip or since we are talking legal, then why not mention Perry Mason. Every time a script borrow from one of these scenes, we can tell whether it is honestly or not, because yes, we agree that you can borrow, but then try to top it or make something out of it, if all you do is a cut and paste job just emptily chaining scenes that have worked in previous shows, let me tell you it will not work. It is amazing that few chapters of lower budget  \\"Remington Steele\\" drew more attention than the same studio's greatest budgeted shows. And what is what they do? Well in the next season, they just decided to remove one of the meaningful elements which it was the competition and dirty tricks that the two male investigators played one another in order to gain the attention of their Boss (Thimbalist) and instead  put a corny fat lady with overly sweetened charms that simply gave nausea and brought nothing to the show.<br />  Producers, if you want the educated crowd, \\"YOU HAVE TO PLAY BY THEIR RULES\\" otherwise you will be stuck with your typical average sitcoms followers for which you should not work so hard as doing complicated show such as this one, just give them another Dallas or Falcon Crest. You will be deceiving yourself and thanks god, wasting your money in stupid endeavors that are way over your heads.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This show is like no other out there.  Ya just keep coming back for more.  We are streaming it and we watch 2 and sometimes 3 shows a night.  On season 3 right now and we can see why it is still going.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|wonderful ending to a great series of three books!  Hope this series is finished in film.  I will look for more books by this author.
1439107955|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my dad. He said that he could not put it down. The story was so interesting he kept on reading it until he finished the book. He said it is an interesting read and that everyone should read it.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Pretty entertaining and visually appealing. The  movie was one of the more original I have seen in quite some time. I would recommend.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|The game is really not that great. The worst thing is the dialogue, everyone sounds retarded especially spiderman. Seriously it's pretty bad. And gameplay itself is not fun and the controls are bad. I would not recommend this game it's simply not worth the money.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Never like bad language, nor profanities - Feel sad when people treat God's name with such carelessness - and why is it always Him? Why not Bhudda? Why not Mohammad? Understand the necessity of context, but made me cringe (every time)<br />That aside, I felt like I was reading a psycological profile of teen angst. It was a feeling book, almost three dimensional in its intensity. Beautiful groupings of words, some of which you had to read more than once because of their richness.<br />Not an 'enjoyable' read; but very thought provoking -  my thanks to a very talented author :)
193700788X|5.0|I always find it interesting to read book reviews on Amazon. Sometimes, I find it interesting how readers focus on different aspects to like or dislike a book. Occasionally, I wonder if we actually read the same book. I find many of the reviews for Dead Ever After to fall into the last category. I don't know if I want to write a review or answer some of the most common comments that left me confused. So, I'll do a little bit of both.<br /><br />First, who said these books were headed to a romantic happily ever after moment? Who said the series had to end with one? When has Sookie ever embraced a romance with any of the men without having a series of doubts and hesitations? She's not the fall head-over-heels in love sort of character.<br /><br />Second, when has a series ending ever really made fans happy? We always want more or different. We want that finale to be something so awesome we will never forget.<br /><br />*********************************SPOILER ALERT**********************************<br />Third person scenes: These have never been used a Sookie Stackhouse book before. However, Ms. Harris has used them in other series to great effect to build tension. Also, fans have complained in the past about the frustration of pure first-person Sookie leaving too much of the action out of sight.<br /><br />Sookie's Telepathy: Ms. Harris always provided rules for Sookie's telepathy that gave her great flexibility as a writer. It worked on most humans (but some of them were harder to read than others). Most shape shifters/Weres were more emotional impressions or murky thoughts  (but sometimes she got clear reads from them). Vampire minds were unreadable (except the occasional flashes she'd get, most often from Eric). For every rule for Sookie's telepathy, there were exceptions to them. Sookie had the same ability to read/not read Sam as she has in the past with Sam and the other two-natured she spent time with (another words, it's always varied in ability depending onany number of factors).<br /><br />Eric: Yes, the Eric-Sookie relationship has been the center of most of the books of this series. Readers have grown to love Eric: he is the \\"bad bay\\" women are so drawn to. He has been protective, loving, and sweet to Sookie; yet, always he does something to remind Sookie (and the reader) that he is both a predator and politician. For every sweet action he makes, he makes one equally cold and cruel. In fact, some of that cruelty has been directed to Sookie. Like Bill, Eric manipulated and hurt Sookie. Regardless of the love between them, Sookie has always had hesitations about Eric's behaviors and morals. The entire series has stressed how much of her own life Sookie needed to sacrifice to date a vampire making a long-term relationship with any of them unlikely. Eric has been Sookie's taste of what a bad boy is like (and let's face it - most women have that one passionate flirtation with a bad boy). They had love but not enough. And Eric's future? It sounds like a good deal. Really. Sookie has been worried for books that the advantage of the Oklahoma match outweighed everything and she had a good point. 200 years? That's about 1/5 of his life. Vampire marriages are about politics, not sex. Sure, he will be required to have sex with a gorgeous vampire occasionally. In return, he gets to do all the things he does really well and gain amazing security in the vampire world. It's a much better and happier marriage than the Queen of Louisiana's marriage. Sookie? Her entire lifespan would have been but 1/10 of what he has already lived, a blink of his eye. If she didn't become a vampire, Eric knew there was no Happy Ever After for him (with Sookie) but only a Happy For Now. He managed to bargain a position that would keep Sookie safe, give Pam a promotion, and give his other daughter a restful duty. He ensured his people were all taken care of and now he gets try his hand at being a bigger fish in a bigger pond.  Ms. Harris took books tobuild this relationship and books to unravel it. How many books has it been since Sookie and Eric had happiness together? How long have they been unraveling? Eric was a predator, he loved the chase. Once the chase was over, he lacked the relationship skills needed to turn passion into lasting romance. I love that Sookie remained true to herself. Like she did with Bill, Quinn, and Alcide, she lost her temper, ended things, and walked away. In this case, she's been torturing herself for a couple of books now about the impending end of her relationship with Eric, she already grieved.<br /><br />Bill: Sookie and Bill resolved their relationship a long-time ago. Whether you are a reader who views Bill as a rapist/abuser or as a typical vampire, Sookie resolved the last of her issues with him a couple of books ago. Regardless, Bill plays the role of \\"first love\\" and always has. However, not much further was needed from him as a \\"main\\" character in Sookie's life since their scenes in the last couple of books have been something along the lines of: Bill \\"Sookie I love you.\\"  Sookie: \\"Bill, you are such a good friend.\\" I'm glad Ms. Harris put Bill-Sookie closure in the book before and offered Bill the glimmer of hope for a new romance of his own.<br /><br />Sam: He is the \\"boy next door.\\" Throughout the series, Sam has been Sookie's rock, best friend, and always had her back. Their scenes have always been the ones that demonstrated the greatest emotional intimacy and greatest affection. Sookie has (off and on) acknowledged that she had lust for Sam while Sam has clearly been crushing on Sookie from the beginning of the books. The ending did not show us with Sookie and her HEA, her true love, her perfect man. Instead, the ending gave us a Sookie who had learned what she wanted from her life and from a man. All the men she dated and/or had attracted to her taught her various lessons about herself. The ending showed her beginning a relationship with possibilities, not a happilyever after moment, but more of an I-know-who-I-am moment with great optimism for the future.<br /><br />Sookie's Journey: Once upon a time, she viewed herself as disabled, let people walk over her, and had few if any friends. Additionally, she had little responsibility and a dead end job. Now? She's gained the respect and acceptance of humans and Supes in the area. She has a variety of friends (telepath, demon, witch, two-natured, vampire, human, etc). She is part owner of a bar, sole owner of a house, and in possession of a nice monetary cushion. She has ended up seriously hurt, frequently near death, as a result of every one of her adventures. She has been kidnapped, tortured, raped. She never showed signs of being an adrenaline junky, she got drug into it because of love or manipulation. Like many a soldier who has come back from war, Sookie seeks peace and quiet after having had her chance to see the bigger world (and the dark side of life). Best of all, Sookie has found happiness with her own self and her own life.<br /><br />I read the entire book twice in 24 hours and felt a deep satisfaction at the ending. Finally, Sookie has a chance at peace and happiness. What more could any character ask for!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Much like myst... I must say, I loved it. Wish I didn't finish it so quickly. Waiting  for more..I'm a waiting patiently. Thanks
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|we watched the movie and loved the music that was in the movie.  Love all the &#34;old&#34; songs in the movie
B007TK77QE|2.0|How could JK Rowling bear to write about so many revolting people with so few, if any, redeeming features? I could hardly manage to cope with reading about them!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Good Book. Lots of action for a book about what happened in the book. Not telling you what happened in the book. It is a  secret. Thanks again
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|The game is nice and adds to the fun factor in that you don't just buy the critters but have to go out and capture them. Like all games of its type it has a strong Incentive to buy the in game currency, but they have to pay for the game somehow!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|People tell me how professional I look carrying this thing around. I love how you can customize the compartments to the way you want it. It's a really great bag!
030758836X|5.0|The story and writing kept me enthralled.  A real page turner with lots of OMG moments.  I recommend it to anyone who likes a lot of  plot twists.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game is fun and exciting ! It is very addicting and wants you to keep playing just to see how fast you can get.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i lov this book because it brought the picture in my mind i reccomend this book to all you people that hve not read this  book
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|There are novels that weave a much more compelling story line. Found myself skimming the last half of the book rather than really reading it.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|One of the surprise reads of the year. Or for some years. Beautifully orchestrated journey which has the delightful habit of touching your heart strings every step of the way.<br />Do yourself, and others a great favour.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I only just finished this book and I am literally left without words. The Fault in our Stars is the most thought provoking book I have read in a long time and I keep finding myself thinking about every little detail that what said. This book was written like you are in Hazel's mind and you know exactly how she feels, thinks, doubts, and loves. Beautifully executed, I feel like I owe this book everything.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This book is inspiring. Whether you are about to turn 100 or about to turn puberty this book will havwe you laughiing out loud and shaking your head in bewilderment.<br />Oh if only it was fact. The world would be a better place. Sillier, madder, more ikncredible but definately better
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I have never played so this review is strictly the opinion of a 9 yr. old girl.  She said, the demo time is way shorter than most demos.  She also said in creative mode, she was not able to put blocks down.  She uninstalled it and downloaded Discovery Lite.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|Like many of my fellow reviewers, I had never knew of this game before the app. That said, this app seems to do what it does well... as long as you're content to play against the AI. I suppose you could play locally versus 3 friends, but that to me seems like something that will probably never happen. I could not find a way to swap out just one robo-player for a local human. Also, there is no on-line remote play which this game is just begging for, you know, make your move, put your tablet on the shelf  and come back some time later and your opponents have played and it's your turn again (ala wordfeud/words with friends).<br /><br />Until it loses it's novelty I'll keep it around, but there is definitely room for improvement thus the 4 star rating.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I give 5 stars because C. H Harris is a superb writer.  I love all the Sookie books and found this one just as exciting, funny, and entertaining as all the ones before.  Good to reunite with old characters and see others leave. Sad to see the set is end, but loved the ending just the same.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|My wife and I really enjoyed the movie and It inspired me to read the book. The story is more complex but no less entertaining and emotional.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I must start this review by prefacing that there are a myriad of actors and actresses in this movie that will appeal to various men and women due to the broad range of acting styles in \\"Star Trek Into Darkness.\\"  My husband and I both wanted to see this movie due to our previous experience of liking the 2009 Star Trek film (it was one of the first movies we caught during the summer 2009 season). With that said, my husband's favorite character portrayal was the skillful acting of Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn. I can understand this because of the Kahn character being depicted as maniacally sinister but intellectually brilliant in challenging Spock and Kirk. As for me, my favorite character portrayals are a tie between Chris Pine's Captain Kirk portrayal, Zachary Quinto's Spock depiction, and Zoe Saldana's acting incarnation as Uhura. I enjoyed how the characters of Kirk, Uhura, and Spock brilliantly managed to keep their personal and professional lives separate for the greater good of saving the Enterprise.  There is even more action in this film and the carefully calculated emergence of new characters such as Dr. Carol Marcus, a  Science Officer (played proficiently by Alice Eve). The following actors also make significant contributions to the film's plot: Karl Urban, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Simon Pegg, Bruce Greenwood, Peter Weller, Noel Clarke, Nazneen Contractor, and Joseph Gatt. \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" is good to watch for those who have previously enjoyed the 2009 Star Trek film and/or like science fiction movies.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|I love Owl City and was excited to get this cd.  It didn't disappoint.  If you like Owl City I would definitely get this!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I first played this game on an ipad over a year ago. Love the innovation and endless imagination this game sparks. There are simple ways to solve the puzzles or complex meandering paths that you can take, I am 27 and love this game, yet it is simple enough for a younger child with a grasp of english and spelling to play.<br /><br />I encountered several bugs in the Kindle Fire version. I am using the first gen Fire. It hung a few times on a menu screen while game play continued, making it impossible to see what was happening in the game. A restart of the app or sometimes of the Fire generally resolved the problem, but was still obnoxious.<br /><br />Overall, probably a 5 Star game, just a bit buggy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A real page turner. Once I would pick the book up, I could not make myself put it aside.  Even cost me some sleep.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Kind of like Lawerence of Arabia: a few good action scenes and endless dialogue describing the troubled politics of the time. You have to be a law student or history teacher to really appreciate this movie. I have worked as a history teacher and I still just couldn't get into it. I have to say though, that Sally Field was the best possible choice for Mrs. Lincoln. She is/was a little understood character in history that must have had a profound influence on President Lincoln but for the life of me I have never been able to understand it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really liked this book.  It was an easy, fun, quick read.  Had me engaged from the beginning to the end.  Had some comical lines in it and it flowed well.  Loved the story.  Very sweet and believable.  Has you rooting for the characters early on.  This is my first read by Mira Lyn Kelly and will definitely not be my last.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I absolutely love NCIS and this season has not let me down. It's funny, dramatic, emotional...  Awesome!  Ziva's darkness mixed with Tony's devotion, Abby's bubbles, McGee's dorkiness, and Gibb's as-always-badassedness makes this season rock!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|As you know there are a ton of fake Fiio E6's out there, here is a great bunch of info from Fiio about how to tell the differences.  Everyone should verify if their product is real before entering a review, and return them ASAP if you have a fake.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This helped me out and I hope it helps you.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great app for your free time...nice to be able to come back and have more coins that let you level progress.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is the best game ive ever played so buy it or else! thanks!  if u buy it u will like it i promise
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is gigaty gigaty. This game is fun and I try to play it as much as possible when I have time
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I think this game is a great mind challenge.  there are plenty of levels to go through do it never gets stale.  have fun.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I can't wait for the next one this is a good game I love it I love looking for clues and the story line the next one should be greater then this one
B0000057C5|5.0|Anyone who is familiar with Rammstein knows that they consistently produce quality products, and this album is no exception.  I love their music.  They have included both the German and English versions of Du Hast and Engel.  I have received hours of listening pleasure from this cd.
B00B6QXN56|1.0|was really disappointed that there is something wrong with the disc.  42 seconds into the recording it just stops.  I really like Joe, and his music is great but the disc has a quality control issue.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|This album is exceptional.  Rammstein just seems to get better and better with time.  I really love the selection of songs on this one.  The pictures are beautiful, unique and very creative - just like the band itself.  I've play this cd over and over again without ever getting tired of it.
B0064BCNA4|5.0|I love  love  it.  Wish I could get selection of more songs. But I love it it I feel like I am really playing
B001KZG99A|4.0|I liked this movie, but the quality of its display wasn't as great. But then again, it's an older movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow. Thats all I can say. And, my other half needs to read this.  It woke things up in me i didnt realize existed.
0812984412|5.0|I know, I'm late to the party. I actually discovered Cloud Atlas on accident due to the film adaptation that was released last year. Let's just say that when you can watch a six-minute-long trailer and still have no idea what the film is actually about, that piques my interest. Being somewhat religious about reading a novel before seeing its film adaptation, I promptly set about acquiring a copy.....and for some reason managed to let it languish on my to-read shelf for months before finally picking it up. What can I say? I have a LOT of unread books on that shelf, and I was working through the numerous Odd Thomas sequels again before reading the newest one for the first time. While I have no regrets about my time spent reading Odd, I should have made time to read this sooner. Cloud Atlas is certainly one of the most unique novels I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I'm told that all of Mitchell's works take place in the same world and background characters recur across different books; I may have to check out some more of his bibliography.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is actually six separate-yet-interconnected stories, each from a different genre, and I'm not entirely sure it should be labeled a novel as opposed to an anthology. But then, I'm not entirely sure I'd go the other direction either. The book resembles nothing so much as a Russian matroyshka doll-as you read, each tale breaks off abruptly in a more-or-less cliffhanger fashion and the next tale begins. When you hit the middle, the stories resume an conclude in reverse order so you end up right back where you started. In addition, the stories are all connected-in each story, a character or characters will read, watch or listen to something related to the previous tale. These connections are even more fun as you revisit the stories to conclude them, as each one leads directly into the next (I'll let you discover the how for yourself). In addition to the explicit connections generated by each character reading, watching or listening to the previous character's story, each of the main characters save one is implied to be the same soul reincarnated across the ages. (This causes a slight problem with Luisa Rey and Timothy Cavendish, as Cavendish's tale is implied to be set in \\"the present\\" and he is in his sixties, meaning he would have been alive at the same time as Luisa Rey, whose tale is set in 1973. So far as I can see, the only way to resolve this apparent inconsistency is to have his tale set in the near future as opposed to the present.) Finally, the same themes recur across all the stories in the book as each character deals with issues of oppression, power, slavery, and violence.<br /><br />﻿The six stories that make up Cloud Atlas are:<br />The Pacific Journal Of Adam Ewing (1849): Adam Ewing is an American lawyer come to the Chatham Islands to conduct some estate business for his father-in-law and boss. While his ship is in port for repairs, he there meets and befriends Dr. Henry Goose, a British exile, who agrees to treat his mysterious tropical parasite. This tale is told in the form of Ewing's regular journal entries.<br />Letters From Zedelghem (1936): Robert Frobisher is an impoverished, bisexual and recently-disowned dropout from Cambridge school of music. In need of funds and occupation, he sets out to attain the post of amanuensis (someone who copies dictation, in this case musical) for Vyvyan Ayrs, the supposed greatest British composer of all time, blind and slowly dying of syphilis in Belgium. While helping Ayrs finish some of his old pieces and begin some new ones, Frobisher finds an incomplete copy of The Pacific Journal Of Adam Ewing in the family library and becomes obsessed with it. Though Frobisher is welcomed into Ayrs' home as a son, his relationships with Ayrs' family are complex, as Ayrs' daughter suspects his financial state and he carries on an affair with Ayrs' wife. Nevertheless, Frobisher manages to find time to begin composing his own works again. This tale is told through Frobisher's letters to his gay lover, Rufus Sixsmith.<br />Half Lives--The First Luisa Rey Mystery (1973): Luisa Rey is a writer for a trashy tabloid who wants to be a serious journalist. When aging scientist Rufus Sixsmith tips her off to a nefarious plot involving the soon-opening Seaboard HYDRA nuclear power plant, Luisa is thrust into a high-stakes contest of wills with opponents who are not afraid to kill to get what they want.... This tales is written as a traditional mystery novel.<br />The Ghastly Ordeal Of Timothy Cavendish (Present Day/Near Future): Timothy Cavendish is an aging vanity-press publisher with a huge problem--due to the highly-public murder of a literary critic, his newest client's memoirs are jumping off the shelves. A good thing? Sure, until Cavendish's creditors come to call and claim his newfound fortune to pay his debts. And when his clients brothers (who are just as respectful of the law as his client himself) demand a cut of the now-nonexistent profits, Cavendish is forced to go on the run. He manages to escape to a \\"luxury hotel\\" where his brother set up a reservation for him....only to find his refuge is in fact an old folks home, and the staff are not very understanding about the apparent mixup.... This section is told via Cavendish's memoirs.<br />An Orison Of Somni-451 (2144): Somni-451 is a fabricant (clone) created to serve without question in Papa Song's diner (I think this is supposed to be a futuristic version of McDonald's). To this end, like all of her sister fabricants, she is engineered with a very low IQ and only the skills and education needed to do her job. But one day Somni-451 realizes she is no longer like her sisters--she has begun to have thoughts and ideas that are far from acceptable to her masters. She doesn't understand how this process began, but she knows it has taken her into very dangerous territory.... This tale is told in the form of a prison interview (not a spoiler--they state this from the beginning) between Somni-451 and an \\"archivist\\" there to document her story for governmental records.<br />Sloosha's Crossin' An' Ev'rythin' After (2321): Zachry is a young man (fourteen or fifteen for most of the story) living on the Big Island of Hawaii years after \\"The Fall,\\" a catastrophe where most of the world's civilization was destroyed (from the scant descriptions, it would appear to have been a nuclear holocaust) and left the survivors in a state of primitivism. Zachry's tribe is the most \\"civ'lized\\" on the island, and they are often visited by the more technological Prescients who somehow escaped humanity's fall relatively unharmed. Zachry's world is forever turned upside down when one of these Prescients comes to live with his family and study their people. This story is told by Zachry sitting around a campfire somewhere in his old age.<br /><br />The connections throughout the novel are interesting. As I mentioned above, each story references the one before it in some way. Frobisher reads Ewing's Journal, and Ayrs dreams of a \\"nightmarish cafe, brilliantly lit, but underground, with no way out....The waitresses all had the same face. The food was soap, the only drink was cups of lather.\\" Sixsmith and Luisa Rey read Frobisher's letters and Luisa tracks down a copy of Frobisher's Cloud Atlas Sextet. Cavendish is given the manuscript of a novel based on Luisa's adventure. Somni-451 is shown a film adaptation of Cavendish's memoir. And finally, the neo-primitive inhabitants of Zachry's post-apocalyptic Hawaii worship Somni as a god (it can be assumed that at some time in their past they found a copy of her Declarations.) In addition, each of the main characters share a birthmark shaped like a blazing comet, a detail that Mitchell has implied is meant to imply that they are various reincarnations of the same soul. (I understand that the film used this to great effect by having the various actors play different roles in each story--though not as the same \\"soul\\" as it would be difficult to get one person to play both Robert Frobisher and Somni-451, for example).<br /><br />Mitchell here presents two fascinating different (though not incompatible--they are separated both geographically and temporally) visions of the future in An Orison Of Somni-451 and Sloosha's Crossin' An' Ev'rythin' After. Somni-451's futuristic Korea is a hyper-capitalistic dystopian corporate state. Certain areas of the world are said to be \\"deadlanded,\\" or rendered uninhabitable by fallout from an undescribed nuclear war in ages past. Mitchell does an excellent job of describing this world from within, communicating everything you need to know about Nea So Copros without ever breaking character. You're left to make sense of certain details on your own, from context, and if you pay attention it will all make sense eventually. Especially watch for how certain modern brand names are now synonymous with their product--sonys, disneys, nikes, etc. It is somewhat unclear whether the nuclear war that is mentioned by Somni and the Archivist is the same as The Fall mentioned by Zachry and his folk, but that wouldn't be too much of a stretch. You get the sense that Nea So Copros is a society on the brink of collapse anyway, so I'm not at all surprised that they have ceased to exist by Zachry's time. The most confusing part of the whole thing is that a nuclear war went down and Korea came out of it unscathed.....just doesn't make sense in terms of the current geopolitical status, but there's at least a century to work with there, so I'll let it go. Zachry's tale is framed as him sitting by the fire and telling his story, so it's oral. As such, there's a good deal of dialect involved--and a lot of apostrophes where he abbreviates words or leaves out letters. Some people won't be able to get past this. Some will go along with it and be blown away by Mitchell's worldbuilding. It's all in how you want to experience the book. In Zachry's world, the Big Island of Hawaii (or Hah Why, as Zachry calls it) is all he knows. Most of mankind has descended back into barbarism and a tribal existence, from Zachry's peaceful folk of the Nine Folded Valleys to the warlike Kona they live in constant fear of. There is, however, one group more advanced in knowledge and in ideas. The Prescients apparently saw The Fall coming and prepared for it, hiding themselves away and riding out the storm. Now they are travelling about, nurturing seeds of civilization wherever they may find it. Unfortunately, these seeds are few and far between, and the Prescients are few in number....<br /><br />Reviewers cannot seem to agree when it comes to this book--what one likes, another hates. For my money, Mitchell's writing here is masterful. Each story has a different narrator, and each narrator has an entirely different voice that feels entirely authentic--you buy entirely that each narrator is a resident of the world they describe. This is no mean feat when one of your narrators is a clone from a future where corporations rule the world and another is a neo primitive from post-apocalyptic Hawaii. Whatever else you say about him, Mitchell is a master of worldbuilding. (Some reviewers disagree and find his use of language in the two futuristic stories gimmicky and distracting. To each his own.) Some may criticize the book's lack of a central driving plot that transcends the different stories, but so far as I can tell that is simply Mitchell's style (I'm told his novel/collection Ghostwritten is the same way, only more so.) Some will be annoyed by the structure of the book, feeling it is \\"gimmicky.\\" Well....yes, it's a gimmick. But it's a gimmick that worked, at least so far as I am concerned. Mitchell himself was well aware of what would be said about this, and even had Robert Frobisher compose his Cloud Atlas Sextet with the same structure, musing \\"Revolutionary or gimmicky? Shan't know until it's finished, and by then it'll be toolate.\\" Most of these detractors seem to think it was all style and no substance, that Mitchell was just showing off. (These reviewers seem to have missed the recurring themes and fixated solely on the reincarnation and self-referential aspects of its interconnectedness. I'll admit, if that was as far as it went, I might agree with them.) Others, oddly, have felt that the book had too much substance and was a bit heavy-handed in its moralizing, that the themes of violence and power and oppression through the various stories could have been more subtle. Maybe a bit, but it didn't bother me--and if you've followed my reviews you know I have a low tolerance for that sort of thing when it comes at the expense of a good story. At the end of the day this is love-it-or-hate-it book, and it does require the reader to actively engage the text--to \\"work for it,\\" if you will. If you are willing to do that, I highly recommend reading this book.<br /><br />It could be argued that there is a subtle anti-religious theme here. Ewing is a Christian, but he is at least to some degree a naive and idealistic fool. Reverend Horrox's views on race and God's planned hierarchy of the world are frankly disturbing. Robert Frobisher, Luisa Rey and Timothy Cavendish all seem to have no use for religion. In the world of Somni-451 all \\"pre-skirmish\\" religion has been outlawed and replaced with a worship of money (Your digital wallet is your \\"soul,\\" and \\"a soul's value is the dollars within.\\") Zachry and his tribe--the most civilized tribe in Hawaii, and one of the most in the world--worship Somni and hold her commands (I presume these are the Declarations mentioned at the end of her story) as religious law. A more suspicious man would see an attempt at making a statement about deifying a Galilean carpenter. Now, do I think this is a reason not to read this book? No. In fact, I'm not even willing to argue definitively for that analysis. But I do think it bears keeping in mind.<br /><br />Content:Overall, I'd have to go with R.<br />Language: PG-13/R. I honestly didn't notice a whole lot about this, as I kept getting to drawn in to pay attention to such a clinical detail. Each story would probably have to be rated separately anyway to get any real sense of this. At least two \\"f-bombs\\" and various lesser profanities, with whatever is said in The Pacific Journal Of Adam Ewing being rendered in classic 19th-century form as d--n, h--l, d---l, etc. That, at least, I found quite amusing.<br />Violence: PG-13/R. A fair amount of violence, and some of it is very evocatively described.<br />Sexual Content: R. This novel contains a fair amount of sexual content, not usually very graphic but nevertheless hard to miss. And I must say that Zachry's language on this subject was quite....evocative.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|A nice driving balancing game. Kind of addicting. Is not coin hungry like so many other games.  Nice way to kill time during breaks.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|Even though my download speeds run 23MBs> 30MBs, my tablet ran slow with it default Android browser and Opera (weak graphics, I presume).<br /><br />So, I thought I'd give Dolphin a try. It's interface and features (which I'd like to see more of) take a little time to get used to. But, it is w-a-y faster than the others. The \\"Gesture\\" feature for bringing up a Website works handily and is VERY useful. The hardest part (at 66) is remembering what gesture I used for each website. I just made the gestures to look similar to say, hD (for Home Depot). It does not have to be an exact duplicate of what you saved as the gesture either. Worked as it should every time. I'm impressed. Recommend giving it a try.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I bought &#34;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&#34; years ago with every intention of reading it. Yet, every time I picked it up I just couldn't make myself crack it open. Once I did begin book one of this series, I felt myself getting bogged down with all of the characters names, the difficult to pronounce Swedish words, etc. I stuck with it though, and enjoyed the first two books of this trilogy very much. &#34;The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest&#34; really did a good job of continuing the story and tying up loose ends. I felt like the characters were very realistic - flawed, and sometimes unlikeable, yet utterly believable. This story really kept you involved with the plot, and was definitely one you felt you couldn't wait to keep reading. The upside of my waiting to start book one of the series, was that by the time I finished it, I was able to plow though books two and three without having to wait for them to be published. I would definitely recommend the series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is my favorite on the app store. Zooming in and out was some times difficult. But can't wait to play the second. Definitely worth the money.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I love this TV series. This is probably the finest cast on the small screen I've seen in a long time. I'm looking forward to season 5.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! Its so much fun! The only bad thing is you have to have Internet! soother than that is Great!!!
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Upgrades make the game more and more fun the longer you play. Visually awesome, the animation is adorable. I got this as a free download of the day from the Amazon Appstore, but I would definitely pay for a game of this quality.
0780619587|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time so i had to buy it. The true life of quite an amazing boy and his life growing up. I love this movie it is moving, deeply touching, sad, powerful, it moves ur soul thats for sure. An amazing life and story.

B007EC27QM|4.0|So far this app has met all of my needs, both at home and at work.  I would certainly recommend this to a friend.
0439023491|3.0|This book isn't bad but it doesn't have the same vibe as the first book... the first book had you on the edge of your seat with the action and hoping they'd survive while this book is more about Katniss trying to come to terms with her life... wondering if she should be with Gale or Peeta... wondering if she should try and calm the districts as the Capitol wants or lead a revolution... and ultimately trying to figure out who she can trust... there's still action and a lot to keep you wanting to know what happens next but it just never quite achieves that same intensity as the Hunger Games did...
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I choose this rating, because of the characters involed. Also the acting was surperb. I enjoyed the love from beginning to end.
0439023513|4.0|this book was extremely emotional and not really what i was expecting to happen but i think if this was a real war then this is what it would be like... often in books you get that glossy image of the hero rushing in and saving the day and the good guys when and the bad guys lose and everyone lives happily ever after... this book really delved into the psychological affects, especially on people so young... altogether it seems a fitting ending for such and series and i personally am happy with it as much as i am saddened by it... this is no glossy ending... in fact i couldn't help but cry over it...
B0042816YK|5.0|I rated this movie so high because I'm a lover of love movies with happy endings. The end of this movie put me in such good spirits.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I finally bought this trilogy when the price was $5 and found it worth it. The first book was very good, the other two were much less entertaining. I would say in the first book 80% of the time I didnt want to put it down but with the other books it was more like 35% of the time. The series just felt forced outside the first book and it just felt like the author didnt have a great direction with where to go with the characters and story.
B006OE7XM4|3.0|Great talent, love On My Way to Harlem, and one or two others, but the song selection is a bit odd for a jazz album. Needs some better choices for choosing material. Love his style though...
B0038DH6WG|5.0|I had read this book a few years ago and liked it very much.  Same with  my husband,  however we were under the impressio that it was nonfiction.  Regardless, the author definitely did some deep research in the aborigini culture.  It is a very interesting book and I highly recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We started watching the series on Nexflix after we finished Breaking Bad. First season was OK, but never really blew me away. Halfway through the second season, we got more into it. This third season is awesome. We are hooked. Highly recommend it.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Not scary but very creepy. Good actors. Twisted story. I really enjoyed it. I like that each season is a complete story but I have not seen any of season two yet so I don't know how I feel about the series as a whole.

B00CIU3IVS|5.0|I was skeptical about the movie, and figured I'd give the soundtrack a chance first.  It did not disappoint.  The original songs are good, the covers are interesting, and in this age of instant gratification singles the order of the tracks actually feels like an album meant to be listened to as an album. The soundtrack convinced me that the movie could be worthwhile.  It is.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|The Rosie Project is only okay.  It is not riveting and sometimes I wish Don would not be such a nerd one minute and then seem to be quite normal the next.  Not a book I would recommend to my friends to read.
0307346617|5.0|As someone who loves history, politics, the military, good novels and sci-fi this had it all. I read this in about two days and couldn't put it down. Great quick read for a trip or a weekend at the beach. Riveting and well thought out scenario of a Zombie attack. Read it before you see the movie and it ruins this fine piece of writing.

0393339882|4.0|Physicists are real human beings and while their thinking is so above ours, Mr. Kumar tells us that the way they come up with their best thoughts is very much like the way we do.  They plod for a while, become obsessed with solving a problem and then when they are not thinking about it, suddenly a connection is made through a simple analogy.  The result?  Relativity and Quantum Physics.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I really love how customizable this mouse is. It has weights that you can add to the mouse to give it the feel that you want. You can add none, some, or all of them. They are about the size of thick watch battery, and install on the bottom of the mouse.<br /><br />The buttons are customizable too, and there are plenty of them! Set one for Forward, one for back for easier navigation, or set one of the others for opening mail, or other programs. Or you can turn them off if you wish, and that is very easy to do with the software.<br /><br />I think the fiber type cord for the USB cord is high quality, and overall it feels like a solid, high quality mouse. The navigation, or moving the mouse is smooth and fluid, and I have not experienced any jumping around of the cursor either.<br /><br />In your hand, the mouse feels comfortable, and the buttons have a nice click, not too loud, but not silent either. The mouse wheel also has a little click, but, it's not loud either. It's just enough to let you know that it is moving.<br /><br />On the mouse itself, the logo lights up, and kind of fades in and out. It's a pleasant blue light that doesn't seem to distract from what's on the screen.<br /><br />Installation was easy, and customizing only took a few minutes, and it felt like it was in my hand for a long time. I hope it is too, because it's a great price for such a customizable mouse.

B009NY43NY|3.0|Wow, I was shocked by the low rating for this book, but on reading the reviews, I'm seeing a lot of people seem to be punishing Harris for effectively not writing another regular installment for the book. It had to end SOMETIME - I really want people to think through their unhappiness and actually spin the question on its head. If YOU end the book, how would you end it? Who would Sookie, given who and what she is, and after all she's been through, realistically be with? How would she realistically move on with with her life, in a truthful way that matches where she lives, where she's from, and all she's been through?<br /><br />Sookie started naive and practical, and has been beaten, kidnapped, raped, tortured, emotionally blackmailed, manipulated, and more. Friends have betrayed her in gigantic ways enough for many people's lifetimes, and she remains pure of spirit but severely jaded. A woman of character - which Sookie is, which is why we all fell in love with her - can't NOT change, after all this, and such a woman is going to want different things from what she wanted when she started her journey.<br /><br />Sookie is not going to want to get with someone who's going to blackmail her, someone she can't trust, someone who may sell her out or be magically compelled to betray her, or someone surrounded by enemies constantly where she's always at risk and literally living like a child with no meaningful power of her own to realistically save or protect herself. She is a sheep among wolves who has to constantly run to someone else for cover, and she does have powerful friends - but at some point in a world of danger like this, you get tired of crying for help.<br /><br />I know the biggest thing people seem to have an issue with is the \\"fast wrap-up.\\" Unless you want Charlene to spend 2 books slowly phasing people out, this is not realistic. She has to do it in one book. Given that she's written 12 other books, I get how it can feel \\"fast\\" to condense all the key characters from those 12 books into a wrap up in 1, but that takes SKILL and it is a perfectly reasonable and fair thing to do. I DO agree it wasn't handled with the same subtlety and love of those characters as Harris used in the previous 12 - she does seem to have disconnected a bit and taken the \\"easy\\" way out with a lot of these characters and their resolutions in the storyline.<br /><br />The other thing is the Sam issue - which should not be a surprise to anyone, even if you didn't want to see it happen (I knew it was coming, but I didn't want that choice for her.)<br /><br />Eric is not a viable choice. Harris spent the last THREE books in a denouement with Eric's character to show us he was not necessarily as changed as Sookie hoped he was; their relationship has been on the rocks and was dying well before this book. The cluviel d'or was the straw that broke the camel's back. I agree that Charlaine didn't handle the ending of their relationship well, but theirs could only ever be a short term relationship, especially because Sookie doesn't want to be a vampire.<br /><br />I agree with people that Sam and Sookie lack chemistry; I agree that he is the \\"safe\\" HEA choice, which is disheartening when we've had a whole series built around a \\"simple\\" young woman who is both attracted to and easily caught up in drama and danger. But the foreshadowing toward that HEA with Sam was built in from book 3 or 4. Sam clearly had feelings for her, and Sookie clearly was aware of those feelings and often deliberately ignored both Sam AND her own awareness of her own feelings for Sam. There were many instances where she \\"felt\\" something and chose not to examine it - that is actually a very clear character component of hers, it's not anti-Sookie; Sookie gets by in the life she's living by denial, and she does it all the time. She's smart, and always admits to herself when she'd rather just \\"not know\\" when deep down she knows. So the foreshadowing was always going to probably end her either with Sam or alone and looking for a better love and life. When in this last book Eric gets ticked at her re: her choice with the cluviel d'or, he makes a comment about how she doesn't know herself as well as she thinks she does - the irony is, she DOES know, she just doesn't want to face it. She chose to save Sam not only because he'd never ask, but because he is the one she has always loved, and always expected to be there. (Personally, I believed their love was familial or platonic - he was her true brother where her real brother was not, and he's the most human of her supe friends.)<br /><br />Personally, I have never wanted her with Sam, but he is the safest, best emotionally healthy match for Sookie. Everyone else in her life is a predator, with alliances to themselves and others where they will often try to manipulate her into supporting those alliances, or they will expect her to play second fiddle to those alliances. She will always be in danger because of their drama, and never have a normal life.<br /><br />THAT is Sookie's change. She realizes effectively she is tired of living in terror, and tired of being manipulated - this is something she's stated ever since things got really crazy halfway through the series, from rape to torture, etc. And her life will always be that with the vampires and the werewolves. Sam is the only one who lives a \\"normal\\" life that she knows, and he gets her, and they are easy.<br /><br />Of course, a lot of us don't think that's justification they should be together, but that was always Charlaine's plan, and I respect that plan. The story DID have to end sometime. How else could it end? Sookie is not a woman who actually wants to be a Vampire Queen. Nor does she want to be a pack leader's mate, and she doesn't want to always be trying to protect herself from people trying to access her mindreader skills. She's a little bit supe - who wants to be with a guy who's just a little bit supe like her.<br /><br />Not a terrible betrayal, in my mind at all; the author fell short in execution, but her plot choices make perfect sense to me. I do feel the beginning was a very slow one, and that the \\"going to jail/court and random enemies are after her\\" storyline were weird contrivances, but I think this was Harris' way of trying to give her a true conflict of her own to resolve that was not driven by the vampire/were politics and was entirely her own to solve. Not her best work in terms of managing all the characters as well as she has in the past, but a good faith effort to wrap things up in a nice little bow.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|the movie sure gets each of your emotions moving, enough said don't want to spoil it. And also sure leaves room for sequels. great movie
B00005JN4H|5.0|I always loved this movie!<br />The fact that it has Jimmy Fallon in it says a lot.<br />He is Hilarious! I love him and the Queen!
B009YVBZO6|1.0|I cannot really say how well this app works, or doesn't work.  I could not activate it once it was loaded.  I called the Amazon app help desk, and the rep could not get it to work also.  I guess that says everything you need to know.
B004OR199G|5.0|Whether or not you're interested in finding a guaranteed way to feel good about everything in life, especially yourself, you should read this book. It's extremely easy to understand, fun to read and a gentle provoker of action and thought.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Kept putting off reading this, the reviews kind of  put me off, with all the talk about history and explaining of food tastes and things like that. And I agree the food stuff was a little much, that's why I gave  it a 4 star and not 5,but not THAT bad. The history went with the story so I don't know what those other ppl r complaining about, I am not a history person and  I enjoyed it, maybe  it was just there mood??? I say read it!! I personally can't wait to read the second one!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like this alarm app because, I can choose sounds or my songs that I have downloaded on my kindle. I wake up to something different everyday!!!
0345525558|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  Tearful and joyful!  The characters were very compelling, as was the story line.  A must read!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|free game with thousands of dollars in extras i guess that is how they set their hooks in you these days
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Seriously. Every. Single. Day. I think I love it more than my husband. (Okay, maybe not that much) Seriously Amazing.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|You fall in love with the characters and cheer for them all along. It's hard to believe children were treated so horribly,it breaks my heart
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It took me about 2 wks to play through, playing on and off. It seems almost to simple to start, but it gets a lot harder as you go through the levels. The reviews that say there is in-app purchases are wrong, they must have removed those.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game. Challenging but not too hard. Good graphics, music not annoying. Can't wait for more games like this. Job well done
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I started watching the hbo series and decided to follow along with the books. Unfortunately I am addicted to the books and am now ahead of the series.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|THIS SERIES IS A MUST FOR FANS OF ANY SCI-FI COLLECTION THIS WILL NEVER BE OUT DATED..AS WITH THE ORIGINAL DAWN OF THE DEAD.WITH BRUCE CAMPBELL OUT IN THE WOODS IN THE CABIN THIS IS ANOTHER KEEPER.
B0028R3G5O|5.0|One of her greatest CDs with plenty of songs sung so well. You will be very happy with this cd.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|enjoyed the dvds and would recommed anyone who has not seen the series to buy it and keep in their collection this is one series that will never get old...
B004J4WQ46|5.0|Every song is awesome. I trully recommend it I LOVE it. Please make yourself a gift for your ears.  Enjoy
B001NLL8LA|5.0|This is a lot different than earlier Reacher stories.  The ending of the story is a bit of a surprise as I expected someone would show up to help with the last man.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|My grandson really wanted this Lego set. He is over the moon building and  playing with it. A &#34;very best&#34; product and the price at Amazon was low and the shipping was fast too!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Love it.  Works great and is easy to store.  It also fits my phone which is a plus for sure.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I didn't want it to end and won't forget it for a long time. I have told everyone with a Kindle, that I know, to get this book.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I mainly bought this to have for my grandsons when they come to visit.  I tried it, and it is fun, but I need a more challenging game.  The kids will like it though.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time the animals are super adorable and I love all the cute little houses you can get.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Crazy about the game...<br /><br />Jewels Star is a very addictive game. I would recommend this game.<br />Its has allot of power to the game,
B003JIM9G8|5.0|Best Batman animation movie to date. Thrills at every turn. Nightwing showing up in the movie was an added bonus to the movie.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|The Heavy just gets deeper and deeper! Warning!!! Short Change Hero WILL get stuck in your head!!! But it's worth it! I also love &#34;Cause for Alarm&#34; This is a fantastic album!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I am not a fan of war, but I understand that it is a necessary price for our freedom, and that we need soldiers that are willing to go to the front for us on our behalf.  Some even go to extremes and excel in what they do, such as the Navy Seals.  From a patriotic and historical perspective, I really enjoyed reading this book, and would recommend it.  Thank you to all our Armed Forces for the job that you do for us everyday!
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This is one of my favorite books in any genre. I really connected with this book. Charlie Gordon is definitely one of my favorite characters of all-time. Really thought provoking and engaging. I loved reading the progression of Charlie's intelligence reflected in his voice and his insights on society. Also, a really sad ending.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This CD is a wonderful thing as it represents Iron Maiden reunited with Bruce and Adrian and it is so good to have them back. Clearly they were determined to create a CD worthy of their earlier work and in that they succeeded. Yes it's not a carbon copy of previous songs but it taps into what makes Iron Maiden so great and what you get is a fresh sounding collection of songs that entertain and rocks your socks off. If you are a fan of the boys, buy this CD.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|This is a great way to use Windows 8 when you  don't have a touch screen. But in Windows 7 a lot of stuff is small (because I use the 7&quot; kindle fire hd) and it's a little<br />harder to navigate. but still awesome and fast:-)
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Yet another solid CD from these guys, they just keep making excellent music. Is it Piece of Mind or The Number of the Beast.....Nope but that doesn't matter, it's not meant to be. Their music has evolved and while it maintains the essence and elements that are to the core \\"Iron Maiden\\", they have added other sounds and styles that blend very well with their past. If you are a fan of the band then you know that just about every CD with Bruce on vocals is a must have, just buy the CD, you will like it!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I gave too much weight to two things (1) he was featured on Oprah and (2) Eben Alexander III was a Neurosurgeon. The book was disapointing because it was too much about Eben's life, his hobbies his religion and not enough about his experience in heaven.  It was after reading the book that I read the reviews and discovered I was not the only person who felt this way. I did not learn anything about heaven after reading this book.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|A good book to read on your down time. Makes your imagination run free. Like the way the author uses language to make book more realistic.
B00ABO573A|4.0|I can't really think of anything that sets the story itself apart from other stories about addiction.  The acting performances successfully portray the love, pain, anger, sorrow etc. so well, and maintain a certain tension throughout.  I enjoyed Thure Lindhardt very much.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I like this app. It is user friendly and makes viewing YouTube clips and full episodes of TV shows on the Kindle Fire very easy.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|I never expected a new album from Agnetha Faltskog. For that alone it stands as an excellent production. Aside from the surprise, this is a really enjoyable listen. There are some really great songs throughout this brand new collection by one of the greatest female voices of the past few decades. She remains in top vocal form and delivers each song with such emotion and passion.<br /><br />The lead single, When You Really Loved Someone is a perfect blend of current production styles with a classic voice. It should appease fans and newcomers alike.<br /><br />Fans of Agnetha's older work, solo and with ABBA, have something to rejoice about with the release of this all new collection of songs. She's even written one of the tracks herself and it turns out to be one of the most touching songs on the album.<br /><br />Nice to see her back in the limelight and sharing that voice that has been missing in the pop music landscape for far too long.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A fantastic game, but can be sort of frustrating or confusing, but great graphics, almost like the people and horses are real. Very addicting, a great game if you like training animals and, well, of course, horses.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I am an 89 year old retired physician. Many times I have wondered what went on in my brain when I made or broke<br />a habit, but I didn't do anything to try to find out. Then Charles Duhigg came along and did my work for me. I am very thankful. I have given about thirty copies to friends.<br />David Goldenberg<br />12504 So.

B0087WRGVY|5.0|There's not a bad song on this album.  Great guitar and vocals.  This is my favorite album of the year so far.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Tremendous hype.  You keep reading thinking it is of the same caliber as Memento.<br />Yes, there will be those that say how interesting that the book reads from different perspectives.  In actuality the book is just a younger adult's version of 50 Shades of Grey - trashy - and not at all good literature.<br /><br />Save your money - and look for a better book - very disappointing.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  Very interesting to read and view the world from a 5 year old's eyes and mind!
B00005LOUP|5.0|Had to replace my old VHS copy.  Nicely fleshed out story based on the original Grinch story.  Runs just a bit too long, but all in all a movie to watch every year.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is so much fun to play my kid loves it. it will keep him busy. it helps him also know how to cut fruits
B005TMSN4E|1.0|It is a little heavier and bulkier than I expected<br />but meets my needs. I am glad I have it as I have<br />a larger Nikon and now I can use all my lens.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This Game is the greatest spider man game ever the webslinging is awesome the fighting is great but the controls need some work other than that the game is great
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Great CD if you're a Blake Shelton fan.  It's a little lovey dovey, but still very good.  Recommended for sure.
B00782O7IY|5.0|great movie-I did not think I would-but-even without words the movie was very interesting-acting was excellent-bought two for my rental condos in fla
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Really good, does not have a bad song. Love it and hope it's not long before another is released...Thanks again for a great cd.
B001G9F9IW|5.0|Penelope Cruz is the star of this movie.  The movie starts out slow,  but once it picks up you can't stop watching.
B00632HWOG|3.0|It does what it should. It is an email app and there's not a lot more too it. It works and does what it is suppose too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|There is survival and creative survival has monsters that kill you collect things and creative has everything this game rocks
B007BVMVDU|5.0|If you take the true-to-life Tudors series then augment it with the fantasy of Lord of the Rings and a base it off a griping story, you'll then have Game of Thrones. If you can see past the shock factor of the violence and sex scenes, you're ultimately left with a very compelling series of interweaved stories and characters which are very dynamic.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is an interesting fun game to play.<br />We play this game of Draw Something with our grandchildren and we really enjoy it.<br />Thank you!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|The Good Wife is a great legal drama that reminds me a lot of the books by Scott Turow.  There is something about the Chicago political landsdape that makes for good legal dramas.  Great writing, great characters, well paced plots, and great acting. I am nearly finished with season one and will move on to season two as soon as I can.  I don't know why I didn't watch this when it first came on TV. Great show!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Love the real history story and the scenery. Dark tones and a sense of how people used to live, and what they would believe in keeps me so entertained. Great stuff.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Didn't think I would like this movie; thought it was going to be hyper-politicized and self-congratulatory.  It was not; really more a story of one committed CIA agent who was relentless in looking for leads to discover where OBL was in hiding, and reveals the complex and thoroughly intertwined nature of Pentagon/Intelligence/Military action for this strike to take place.  I would sort of place it in a detective/mystery genre (obviously based on history).
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had a great time playing this game. The puzzles were challenging but not impossible to figure out.<br />I will definitely buy any sequels.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I enjoyed it. My 3 and 4 year boys got a little scared. Maybe the 2nd time around it would be fun.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I chose the rating because it isn't the best book I've ever read, but it is highly enjoyable. It started a bit slowly, not so much that I was tempted to put it down, but I kept waiting for the excitement I expected from watching movie trailers. Pi was an interesting and well-drawn character. When the ship wrecked, I became very engrossed and kept reading well beyond where I intended to stop.I liked Pi's insight into the animal psyche, and, an animal lover as well, I did not like the mental picture of the zebra's death. I also wanted Pi to take the tiger home with him, fast friends forever. The story suspended my disbelief as well as any I have read in a long time. I was so convinced that I looked on the internet for a reference to islands made of seaweed. Good read.  Good work, Yann Martel.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Wow. The actors are able to display characteristics of their future characters without making caricatures. The plot is good, the action is fast, and if you have any affection for Spock's character at all, you'll love this.<br />The characters of McCoy, Scottie, and Chekhov foreshadow their adult characters wonderfully. Uhura is over serious, but her character is featured, which sort of makes up for how she didn't get enough screenplay in the series. You don't get much humor with Sulu, but he does get to 'fence'. You will like that.
B00B47NO2O|1.0|Boring, predictable, and no sort of originality on sociopathic killers. Do yourself a favor and watch HANNIBAL instead. The superior cinematography, writing, and acting will not disappoint.
1439127700|4.0|This book is very well written. It is very insightful and captivating. A lot of the information is stuff that you may have heard of, but the author always goes deeper into the subject revealing and exploring angles that I dont believe the general public is aware of unless you have read a lot of former presidents' memoirs.<br /><br />If the title of the book caught your attention and you are reading reviews to decide whether or not you might enjoy the book, go ahead and buy it. You will enjoy it. I believe a little more effort could have gone into Obama. I understand that there is not a lot of history from which to extract a story, but more effort could have been put forward so the reader is not left with the feeling of a \\"pre-climatic pull-out.\\"  That is kind of how I felt. Throughout the whole book my mind kept racing forward to Obama, then we we got there it all ended \\"prematurely.\\" Wasn't Obama president when the earthquake hit Haiti?? I believe the President's Club got involved in that, but it was not mentioned (the book focused on how the club got involved when things happened). No mention of Biden. No mention of the first black first lady...lots of angles to include more about our current president.<br /><br />I look forward to reading about this topic 20 years from now...does the President's Club allow black folks??  Or is it a whites only club???? The future will tell how far we are from our past.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie was one heck of a thrill ride. Full of action and violence, there is never a dull moment. The story was actually entertaining and the play between Dredd and his rookie partner kept things interesting. I don't want to give too much away, but there is even a twist that gives Dredd a real challenge and heightens up the tension as the movie progresses. I hope they make a sequel. If you are worried that this is anything like the disaster that was the Stallone movie, forget about it. This is great movie that is true to it's source material.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thogoughly enjoyed this page-turner from Grisham. Each chapter kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end.
B00004YA66|5.0|It was cheap, and in a good shape.  It came home in a couple of days, much sooner than expected
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|The book was intelligently written. I laughed, I cried, I became angry at one time and I fell in love. This book was very captivating. I could not put it down for fear I would miss something.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|I thought I wrote a review of this back when it came out, but I realized recently I didn't. Better late than never, even though it seems it may be out of print currently. Never the less, if you are interested in this, I can't recommend it enough. I still watch it periodically when the mood strikes, 8 years on! Seems to me Dido's studio recordings are a bit over produced and instrumentally lifeless. I've never gotten to see her perform in person, so I was pleasantly surprised that she is fantastic live. Assuming the video doesn't have any post production vocal trickery (no evidence of that that I saw), Dido's voice sounds just as good live as in studio. It's the musicians and live arrangements that really make this concert special, though. The energy and honesty that these songs acquire in concert is amazing. This energy, combined with the extended and modified arrangements make this exactly what a live performance should be: exciting and fun! Technically, the sound is great and nothing about the picture or videography distracts.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|This game is pretty good. There's a nice story line. However,  I don't like the voice acting, nor the driving.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I had this game on my phone and I have been waiting for a long time for you guys to put it on the Amazon app store so I can have it for my Kindle fire. There is not one thing wrong with this app. The only thing that you have to watch out for is the fact that once you start playing you can't stop.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|Reading the 1st few pages were very difficult, but I'm glad I bought this book! Thank you for sharing your story. You sound like an amazingly strong woman!! Look forward to reading Lovely Bones.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I feel that Sookie ended up where she needed to be. However, I feel that the story was rushed. Overall, I'm disappointed in how sloppy the storyline is. Ms. Harris should have spent less time talking about the lush garden and more time on the actual plot. It varies between monotonous and rushed not to mention predictable.
B000001ELB|5.0|This is the first KISS cd I have ever bought and I loved it .  To be honest the reason I bought it was after watching Gene Simmons Family Jewels  and getting to know the familiy and other band members . I  just loved th all and it made me curious about their music . I am 62 same as Gene ( almost 63) and never had a lot of interest. Boy was I wrong they are amazing.<br />The band is in my option the best I've ever heard . I also saw the DVD of them playing with the Sympathy in Melbourne and was blown away . I am now a big fan of the band and will be buying more CDs. Love them love the incredible music.  They are a credit to themselves and deserve the respect they get.
B000002IZM|3.0|I thought it would be all music  - there is a lot of talking .  Not what I expected, hence the mediocre rating.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|the room is a wonderful game and highly entertaining but short. it only took me a few hours to beat it but we'll worth the money
1439152802|4.0|This was the third Kate Morton novel I read. As the previous, it is very well written, which makes it fun to read. As the story advances you start to imagine what is going to happen, but as you think you have guessed the plot, it changes and delivers a completely different story.<br />Although, even when she masters the art of telling a novel in two different periods of time, I would love to see a different style from her, it's starting to get predictable.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was extremely cute and I laughed out loud when I watched it. This movie is certainly recommended for children of all ages. I watched it with my kids, and they were pestering me to let them watch it again. This movie is full of action and suspense, but it has no inappropriate parts, so that's another plus.<br />  This movie takes place in an arcade. Wreck-It Ralph lives in the game Fix- It Felix, Jr. All day long, he breaks the building and Felix fixes it. At first, Ralph is kind of sad that he's the bad guy, so he tries to to earn a medal. He goes to Hero's Duty to get it. Right after he steals a medal, he accidentally steps on the egg of a spider-like creature and it attaches itself to him. Then, Ralph steals a spaceship and tries to go home to show everybody his medal, but he doesn't see where he's going, as the creature is over his eyes, and he flies into Candy Rush, a racing game, where he meets an annoying little girl who wants to get into the race. She steals his medal to use it as a coin, which she needs so she can get in. The only way for Ralph to get it back is if the annoying little girl, Vanellope, wins the race.<br />  Ralph does whatever he can do for Vanellope to win the race, until a visit from King Candy. The king tells him why Vanellope can't race, and for good measure, gives the medal back to Ralph. To keep Vanellope safe, Ralph destroys her car and goes back to his own game. There, he finds that Felix had gone to look for him, his game was supposedly out of order, and there was nobody in his game. Miserable and lonely, Ralph throws his medal and partly knocks down the out of order sign. Then, he sees Vanellope on the side of the Candy Rush game console. He returns to Candy Rush, where he finds that King Candy may have had his own agenda. Now, Ralph has to save Candy Rush, find out King Candy's plan, save Vanellope, find Felix, and destroy all the spider-like creatures. It seems impossible, but Ralph is determined to do it all.<br />  Wreck-It Ralph is a very cute movie, and I really enjoyed it, and so did my kids. It was very cute, and I have no complaints.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|it is amazing how you can put voices together as a duet with people that are not even alive.  But this collection is wonderful!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I loved this book.  A great sequel to Killing Field.  I would highly recommend it to thriller/suspense novel enthusiasts.  Lee Child's main character, Jack Reacher, is a true hero.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app! The customizations are easy to manipulate to get the sounds you want, at the volume you want. The choices are good too. I downloaded this to use with my mobile spa business and I play the sound mix along with spa music to create a relaxing atmosphere that my clients love.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This movie is so much fun, especially for those of us who love scifi!  The first time I saw it, I swear I found my friends and I in the convention crowd scenes.  I had forgotten how much fun watching this movie can be - I laughed out loud - again!  This cast is obviously having a great time making good-hearted fun of the genre and those of us who tend to be a little too in love with our favorites.  And anyone who watches it will have the same kind of fun!  Get out your popcorn and be prepared for a good laugh!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This is a great portable battery. I have an older version of this, and just purchased this for my parents, who were impressed with my battery and recently run their phones completely dead taking pictures while visiting the grandkids.<br /><br />My experience with it is exactly as described when I purchased it. When using the slower 5v/1A port, I get 4 complete phone recharges, and when using the faster 5v/2A, slightly less than 4 charges. And last weekend, while out of town for a wedding, I used it charge both mine and my wife's phone overnight in the hotel. After that, it still had about 1/2 of it's capacity available. That was the first time I had tried charging two phones at ones, and was impressed at how well it did.<br /><br />The battery pack holds it's charge well over time too. I only have to recharge the battery pack from using it, not from it loosing charge over time when not used.<br /><br />The LED flashlight on it is really bright, and has come in handy at times too.<br /><br />For the price, you can't get a better portable battery pack.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Clean, easy to use and informative insofar as battery life remaining for different tasks.  Well worth the $2 and one of those must-have apps that are truly must-have.
1451695195|4.0|I also have had similiar revelations although not by dying. Would reccomend this book to anyone wanting a glimpse of heaven.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie-<br />movie - 3.5 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />basic, nothing new - action movie, lots of gunfire, explosions, car chases- you<br />know, the usual die hard stuff.<br />great video and audio throughout, pity the movie itself wasn't as great as the<br />visuals.<br />still get it if you already have 1-4 on blu ray to complete your collection.
B000E8N690|5.0|The quality and packaging is perfect.  I love buying DVD's this way.  I have never been disappointed in my purchases.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|A nice length for being able to read while plugged in (tip, flip your Fire over completely so that the cord sticks out the top, bending the cord by leaving it on the bottom is what did my last one in!), but would have been nice to know that there's no way to get power to it without either a plug adapter (now it shares time with my iPhone plug until I get around to picking up another one) or a computer.
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|l don't know what all these people are talking about I love this game it keeps all my young children busy while I do things around the house I LOVE IT!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This appears to be a great app. I wish the developer would kindly let us know why the app needs access to the internet. Ads to support the developer are understandable. But it's the unknown that bothers me.<br /><br />Update: May 20, 2013<br /><br />The developer contacted me almost immediately with the fact that the app actually was not supposed to have network access.  He indicated he will remove network access in an update within a few days. In that the app is quite innovative, works well and the developer is very responsive I'm am increasing my rating to 5 stars.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I absolutely loved the 3 books and the main point of the story, but wish the author would have settled things a bit better in the end.
B00992CF6W|1.0|the app wodent download but every other paid app on the app store would its like the app store just took<br />the Mont an ran strongly reccimend minevr
B0074YVW1G|5.0|From &#34;Character&#34; to the Personality cult. The book explains so much of what has happened in my lifetime.It should be required reading for those of us who do not always feel at home in society and the workplace. Furthermore all teachers, parents and employers should study the book.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|When this GPS watch is working it is great. Sure, its battery life is long. Yes, its features are cool. Yep, the information is quite accurate and the bezel feature is pretty neat (although a bit erratic). But none of these things are useful in any way WHEN IT DOESN'T TURN ON!<br /><br />My watch has become completely unresponsive to anything at all, resets included, twice now. There is no warning whatsoever. The screen just goes blank and nothing can make it show any sign of life.<br /><br />I purchased this watch is July of 2011. It did this the first time just a few months after I purchased it. I sent it back in and Garmin sent me a new one. Now, about a year and a half since receiving the replacement, it has done it again. I don't do anything out of the ordinary when running. I am not a heavy sweater (although a running watch should be built to stand up to any amount of sweat) and I don't run in extreme conditions (maybe a light rain or an occasional snow flurry). I lay it out to dry immediately when I get home and charge it on a regular basis.<br /><br />The first time it died Garmin replaced it under warranty, but now I am having to pay $55 plus shipping to them to have it replaced. There seems to be a major problem with this watch and while I think its just fine when it is functioning, I wouldn't buy it again for the risk of it becoming completely unresponsive out of the blue. Unfortunately, I won't be surprised if this happens to the new one they are sending me, too. Here's hoping 3rd time is a charm.
B00756GKBA|2.0|'Beautiful killer', and 'Love spent' are the only [real] songs on this album. 'Love spent' would fit perfectly on 'Confessions on a dancefloor' with 'Beautiful killer' right along with it. Not all of the songs on 'Confessions...' were modern-disco beats, remember? We can do without MDNA.<br /><br />I wrote a lengthier, more detailed review for this album at least 4 times. Each time I've gone back to review it, it was non-exisistant. I had this same issue with Pink's latest album as well. Any detailed thoughts that I write Iin regards to current albums, they continue to be discarded. I wrote less detailed review, with hardly anything to say ---and now it's listed. How strange?
B0091REZMW|5.0|The game is so much better now that the Kindle edition can get updates. My whole family plays together. I absolutely love this game.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I can't even find the download. It seems to be a common issue here. I keep reading the posts on how to resolve it but it doesn't work either. I'm not an Idiot when it comes to computers. It just flat out doesn't't work and a complete waste of my time!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Probably one of the &#34;smartest&#34; comedies to come around.  Though these nerds are some of the hippest nerds around.  I love it!
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Gets boring really fast, slow pace, don't waste your time on this not as good as jewels or candy crush
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. The graphics are awesome on my Fire HD. I have several games by this company, and paid more for this one than the others. Probably the most I've paid for an app, but worth every penny, IMO.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Same as if you are on the computer easy to navigate and pin love how it is set up on the kindle
B0068THAGY|4.0|Super 8 is built on a fun story line.  The young actors steal the show with a strong balance of action, young inspiration, and suspense.  Great fun!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Omg I couldn't put it down until I finished. It was amazing. I'm reading Mockingjay next. Even better than the first one.
0465068367|3.0|For many years, the Rape of Nanking was never spoken about largely because many of the surviving Chinese were humiliated by the whole experience, as well as the efforts put upon by the Japanese government, in addition to educational systems, to cover it up. This is was not an easy read for much of the graphic content was hard to stomach. Within the book you will find photos of Chinese people being tortured, decapitated, a woman with a sharp object protruding from her vagina, all the while noticing the smiles upon those Japanese faces committing the crimes. The book addresses the many rapes that took place by the Japanese soldiers to that of civilian women, where more often than not the women were not only raped, but were disemboweled, had their vaginas torn apart by knives, their breasts cut off, or were tied up and sometimes forced to endure sex with as many as 40 soldiers a night. Many of these Japanese solders were so used to killing that the mere act of slaughter became boring to them, and games were created for how to kill people.<br /><br />It was also interesting to learn the ways in which the Japanese tried to cover it up. Chang addresses the ways in which the Japanese history books have been edited and rewritten, where the Rape of Nanking is presented not as a systematic slaughter to kill the Chinese people, but as the mere result of war. I found many similarities between those who deny the Rape of Nanking with those who deny the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide, as well as ways in which government works to hide the evidence. Deniers carp with the numbers murdered (saying it is much less), claiming the murders were not systematic but as a result of war, and also claiming the victims had rebelled as a means to justify the invasion and murder. It is easy to compare these acts done by the Japanese soldiers to those done by the Nazis, but largely the difference resides in the fact that the Nazis filmed much of their crimes and thereby left large amounts of footage behind. The Japanese worked very hard at covering it up, (just as the Turkish government did with the Armenian Genocide) as well as many of the survivors who refused to speak about it, out of fear and shame.<br /><br />As a second-generation Chinese American, I was horrified at the explicit details of this atrocity. This has confirmed many of the stories my grandparents had told my brother and I about this tragic event. I agree with Chang that the Nanking Massacre should be acknowledged by the Japanese government as an event that did occur despite the lack of evidence. This alarming read was definitely an eye-opener; however, Chang struggles remaining objective for the book is based on a biased argument from the Chinese perspective. Perhaps, Chang could have presented perspectives from the Chinese, Japanese, and Western societies. The author makes no attempt at hiding her disdain for the behavior of the Japanese soldiers in 1937, and continued on to take her tirade against the Japanese today. The narrative style often went off tangent from Chang's skewed argument and many of the generalizations did not substantiate Chang's main claims. I do wish Chang utilized footnotes more effectively in presenting the evidence from the diaries and research. I applaud Chang's enthusiasm for promoting awareness of the Nanking Massacre and hope that more accurate accounts would be written for generations to remember.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show and well produced. Addictive story line. So nice to not have to deal with commercials. Looking forward to season 4.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|If you're a fan of diner dash and cake mania, this is your game. Really fun and long game play
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Make sure you get the one with David Attenborough. Overall really spectacular footage, the 10 minute shorts on the filming of the series are also very awesome.
0679735909|5.0|I wasn't sure that this book was for me but I found that I did actually enjoy it very much.  It's a fascinating story within a story.  There is actually a film out based on this book which I thought was well done.  I would recommend that you read the book and then look for the film on Netflix.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Star Trek Into Darkness is a spectacular addition to the franchise. It's one of the very best Star Trek films, and is even better than the reboot that preceded it. SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />What makes it so good? In the first place, it's action-packed with great special effects, which is kind of key for a summer blockbuster, but that alone won't cut it with Star Trek fans. It also has good writing and surprisingly good acting. A lot of the plot is character driven, as Chris Pine's Kirk and Zachary Quinto's Spock continue to take each other's measure: by now Kirk and Spock are friends, but rather uneasily so. The impulsive, by the seat of his pants Kirk finds his relationship to Spock tested by Spock's logical, by-the-book approach that threatens Kirk's very career, while Quinto's Spock does a great job of trying--ultimately without success--to suppress his emotional, impulsive side. By the end of the movie, each of them has applied and learned the value of the other's approach, doing a bit of a role-reversal. Pine and Quinto manage to bring some real depth to this struggle. This is further accentuated by the fact that, as is often the case, the struggle is over matters that reflect current events. Do we arrest terrorists or treat them as legitimate targets of war? Can we cross international boundaries to get at them? Where do Kirk's and Spock's real duties lie? Where does revenge fit in, if it fits in at all?<br /><br />The character who forces Kirk and Spock to wrestle with these issues, partly against their will, is the superb Benedict Cumberbatch, who gives the movie franchise some of its strongest acting ever. Cumberbatch is bound for great things, and he shows it in this role. Midway through the film he is revealed to be none other than Khan Noonien Singh, whom he plays with a dramatic intensity worthy of--and even exceeding--the performance of Ricardo Montalban. Khan is an intriguing character, and Cumberbatch takes him to a whole new level, his schemes consisting of wheels within wheels, becoming in at least one way like a sinister mirror image of Kirk. If Kirk's actions are justified by his concern for his crew, then aren't Khan's as well? A disturbing thought, given where Khan goes with it.<br /><br />But that's not all. Karl Urban continues to channel DeForest Kelly's McCoy, even more successfully than in the previous film. He trades the inevitable barbs with Spock, but most of his relational development is with regard to Kirk in this film. Bruce Greenwood gives another strong, but all too brief, performance as Chritopher Pike. The rest of the Enterprise crew are in fine form as well.<br /><br />One of the nicest touches for hard-core trekkies is how skillfully J. J. Abrams and the writers have woven Trek lore into the plot, and in a way that (mostly)  doesn't feel forced. Khan's appearance is foreshadowed by events that are clearly referenced in the original series as well as Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Carol Marcus slips deftly into the story line as well, providing in interesting link to the shadowy Section 31, the very mention of which warns us that all in this film will not be as it seems. And the reprise of the death scene from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is pulled off with great care. It could have been cheesy, an instance of Star Trek lampooning itself, but the result is anything but that. And in consequence, we get to see the genetically-engineered superman Khan in a knock-down flight with an enraged Vulcan. The only thing that felt a bit odd was a tribble as a lab rat. (How could you, McCoy?)<br /><br />Of course, this isn't the original series. The actors are different; Abrams's' approach is different; the times are different. Nevertheless, Abrams has been true to the original in some core ways. And in this film, even more than the last, he's set himself a high bar for further entries in the franchise. Well done!
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|I don't like this app because when you hit a small bump you go flying and land upside down because its to backheavy.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I've read up on this subject & I enjoyed this book.  I would recommend.  It is well written & an honest first person account.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|This film was certainly not for me.  It started out with badly and ended badly.  For a few moments somewhere in the middle of the film it started to go somewhere and then failed.  I will be using this disk as a target.  Please note that the acting wasn't bad, but the theme sucked beyond description.  If anyone wants this disk, send me postage and its yours.  If nothing is received after five weeks, I'll shoot it with my shotgun and put it out of its misery.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Just like many others, I was blown away with the movie Searching For Sugarman. An incredible story, and it's hard to imagine that this great artist was more well-known in South Africa than Elvis, and yet never earned any money because his music was pirated.<br />Not only did I buy this album, I also bought his other album, Coming From Reality. I'm hoping Rodriguez finally not only gets the recognition for his work but starts to get amply paid for his talent. I do hope we'll hear more music from this humble genius!!
B005LAJ212|5.0|Just love it,  keeps me on the edge waiting to see what will happen next, so many little twist and turns...
B001ZG4J00|5.0|I already reviewed this great artist when I purchased Cold Fact. I liked it so much, I also bought this album. If you haven't seen the movie Searching For Sugarman, please do. It's an amazing story, and this very humble man deserves to be rewarded for his great talent that except for South Africa, has been hidden from the rest of the world. See the movie!!!!!
B002EDH0FE|2.0|I thought maybe this was a movie you had to see a couple of times to appreciate it.  I was wrong.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Quick to pick up, tough to master and enough randomness to keep things interesting. Simple controls, loads of data and fun &quot;news&quot; items for a bit of comic relief. Worth each and every cent. Power-ups are available for purchase, if you're impatient,  or collect them as you go. More games need to adopt this sales model. Happy genociding!
B000IHSKSY|5.0|Very comfortable, good fit.  I haven't had them in the water yet but these are now my favorite shoes for summer.
B000065K6N|5.0|I love this movie n it is one of the most cool anime movie that ive seen since i was a lil girl.
0470913029|5.0|There are so many diet books with cookbooks attached. This one I actually use and the diet works. Great recipes. Great company service and quick shipping to home.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|friend told me to watch it and so I started from the beginning watching it on amazon prime. I cannot get enough. I know its a tv show but I think it is funny that an attorney who hasn't worked in over a decade can just jump back it with like it was yesterday. also thought the whole firm revenue thing was hilarious cuz, really? anyway, very entertaining show, seen every episode now and cant wait for a new season. oh and im so addicted that I watched all the free episodes on amazon prime and then paid $1.99 per episode to watch the most recent season...that's over $40 and it was worth it. I didn't even go to work for a week so I could watch all the episodes, its that good.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This app clearly and cleanly fills a need. The interface is simple and intuitive. There are times when the 'normal' representation rounds unnecesarily or is less clear than a simple fractional representation.<br />  Some of us know that 0.4375 = 7/16. Many prefer 7/16.<br />  On the other hand, 0.1428571 <> 1/7, though it's close.<br /><br />While this calculator is an EXCELLENT tool for solving beginning 'fraction' problems in Math class, it is a dangerous end-around for that purpose. This Math teacher would strongly encourage you to attain a fluid understanding of simple fractions. Truly, 'fractions' represent one aspect of Math class that you WILL use in everyday life.<br /><br />Absent RPN, parentheses or memory slots become very desirable. Without a viewable rolling 'results' stack, you may need to keep paper & pencil handy.<br /><br />In any event, this app earns its place in my Kindle Fire's limited memory.  I like it.
1401923127|5.0|This book is a life-changer. Dr. Lipton is a great writer as well as a front-line scientist. I'm now reading his next book, &#34;Spontaneous Evolution,&#34; with the same enthusiasm.
B009X01D9U|5.0|This is a very easy reader to use and order books on.  I also check my email on it, google stuff, go on line and lots of other things.  I only wish the battery staying power was longer.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I could've got an f for multiplying fractions and I'm pretty safe I guess maybe but still I'm happy that I got this for free
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This is one of those movies (along with The Godfather) that I watched when I was younger and didn't really appreciate it. I re-watched it a few years ago and it quickly moved into my top 10 favorite movies of all time (along with The Godfather). Unfortunately it wasn't released on Blu-ray at the time, so this has been a long time coming. Blu-ray quality, both audio and video, are top notch. This is a must buy.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I bought the game but when I tried to download it it said there was an error. Can some one please help me. I really want to play this game.
0316134082|5.0|Love the series. The collectors editions have thicker pages than the other books and some coloring at chapter starts. Look nice on your bookshelf
B004KPLVV8|5.0|Loved it when I first saw it 30 years ago. Loved it today.<br />Now my kids love it too, plus got a taste of movie history.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|simple download and easy to use.  just like logging on to the weather channel only much faster.  works well on my kindle fire hd
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|I saw this with the understanding that it would in no way compare to the original.<br />Not too bad, all things considered. Still can't touch JC's film, but a decent set-up for it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was  Great game that booked you from the beginning with its storyline and really made you feel like you wanted to keep coming back to play. My only problem with it was it was too short and that I can't wait for more!
B002RXMG00|4.0|Alfred Hitchcock was a genius with the camera. Amazing on the effects he could achieve for the time. I have watched this before but I never really saw how risque for the time it was. Now I know why it was rated R but today I doubt it would be.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|From 4 + this is a game for all ages. I would like to see more Pudding Monsters. Keep up the good work.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Love this game. It stopped working after a couple of weeks though. Don't know how to fix it. Need help
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|We love Om Nom and enjoy feeding him candy. Keep the games coming; this is a winner. Any age can play.
B00BG4RLF6|5.0|Very talented guy and if you have a good music set up at home you'll enjoy the quality of the recording and his voice. Listening to this spurred me to buy his first album and also buy tickets to his tour.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|We love puzzles and Cut the Rope fits the bill. Easy and difficult. Wish there were more games like this.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is a hidden picture with a fun adventure throughout that makes you think while playing.  I highly recommend!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I want to give it 10 stars because I love this game and finished all the levels. Please make more games like this.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|My kids have been wanting to see it for a while.  So I rented it and we all watched it.  It was fun for adults as well as kids.  Really a fun kind of movie for the whole family.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Liked the book, but had many characters to follow.  Also, the ending was odd.  I felt no resolution after the last page....the primary question of the book was nOt answered.  Did the clinic stay open or not?
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Game play is excellent.  Only features I don't like are within the game itself.  Such as... the tiles are very small and I have virtually 20/20 vision.  I understand this is from the small screen and I got over it quickly.  Another example would be that the &#34;flower&#34; or &#34;seasons&#34; tiles are very hard to distinguish.  Again, nothing a little patience couldn't fix, but I have enjoyed other versions of Mahjong more.  Finally, the game is set to automatically reshuffle the tiles so you &#34;win&#34; no matter what.  I like a little more challenge than that, personally!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this by happy accident and could not stop reading until I read the entire omnibus...complex characters and a richly layered plot that definitely draw you in and keep you captivated until the very end...and then leaves you begging for more.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|Any Monster High fan will be thrilled with this new release..so cute!  Mattel did a nice job on this one...she has her pet pincushion - this one is pink.
B00BF123WG|2.0|People do talk without F this in every other sentence. Displayed limited vocabulary of the CIA and our military. Would not recommend for any non- adults.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|I really loved the first two albums, and I don't know why I thought this one wouldn't be great.  I listened to \\"Ya Hey\\" and \\"Step\\" about 5x each before I bought the album, and I think I've listened to the entire album at least 20 times now.  It's a more mature album than the last two, but it stays fun and catchy at the same time.  Ezra and the gang did things on this album I never thought I could like, and made me love it.  Case and point, the chipmunk sound on \\"Ya Hey\\" and the effects on Ezra's voice in Diane Young.  On paper, I really thought I'd hate that...but they use their effects beautifully.  Hannah Hunt has probably already played 30 times between my record player, laptop, and iPhone.  Every time they get to the piano pick-up in that song, I tear up.  It has hints of a Wilco sound that works for them.  I'm in love with this album.  I hope I don't get too worn out on it too soon.<br />I will say that there are about 5 tracks that stand out alone, \\"Ya Hey\\", \\"Step\\", \\"Hannah Hunt\\", \\"Obvious Bicycle\\", \\"Unbelievers\\", \\"Finger Back\\", and maybe one other depending on your taste (some may disagree about a couple that I listed), however, listening to the album as a whole makes every track pivotal in my opinion.  I love how it flows together.  I strongly recommend getting it on vinyl and just letting it play to really experience what this album has to offer.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Season after season, remains very interesting.  The characters have great depth and believabililty. The acting is very well done.  Keep up the good work.
B001A3GSFW|5.0|Come on, do I really need to sell this to you?  If you like punk music, this is a no brainer: it's the Ramones.  Sure there's a couple songs that aren't so good, but almost every song here is a keeper.
B0016BPWNM|4.0|David Bowie remains strange; the plot is somewhat convoluted; I enjoyed the borrowing from M.C.Escher.  A bit dated but still very interesting
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Rented it because of Tom Hanks...<br />Very hard to understand his words.<br />This one is a mind bender... in an extreemly odd way.<br />Recomend it... NO<br />Wait til it's free... then see for yourself.
B00000JPH6|4.0|Rather intense and for little kids a bit too scary.  Wonderful costumes; interesting thematic material.  I enjoyed watching it a second time
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I like all of K. Reichs books and this is no exception. Didnt know til the end 'who done it'.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Really enjoyed it.Free version too short.  I wish that the free version had more to it. Full version costs 2 much
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie will bring tears to your eyes as soon as you start it.  It is incredibly well done, and I believe captures, as best as possible, what it must have been like to have been involved in the tsunami.  I don't think I could have, in my wildest imagination, even have had the slightest idea what it was like, but this movie does a great job.  It is amazing that anyone survived.  Based on a true story.  Just be prepared to cry.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I haven't been able to find another puzzle app like this one. This app lets u pick how big (how many puzzle pieces) u want to work on and my favorite part is the choice to make the puzzle more difficult by choosing the rotate option, -meaning will have to rotate some pieces to fit. Love it.

B00915G6WQ|2.0|I own every season of Dexter and couldnt wait for season 7.  Ive felt that the show has been going down hill for some time now sadly as it became more and more unlikely, less about the psychology of what is happening, and frankly, increasingly more boring.  As slow and dull as season 6 was, it at least still had some great, taut, suspenseful parts to it as well as some truly horrific imagery.  It also ended with a huge bang.  For season 7, they really didnt bother.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />!. They completely forgot to add any suspense to the entire season.  I mean not one ounce<br /><br />2. One of the main things has always been Dexter trying to hide his big secret, his dark passenger if you must. Is it just me, or was there no secret to hide this time around? Deb knew, the new girlfriend Hanna knew, hell Laguerda knew. Granted the captain was trying to get Dexter, but was there ever even a moment in which you ever felt she might?<br /><br />3. In the final episode at the end, Deb shows up at the container and draws her gun. Was there even a fraction of a second in which you werent absolutely certain shed kill Laguerta? How much more predictable and one dimensional could this season have been?<br /><br />4. Was there ever really even a bad guy, an arch nemesis this time around? Sure, you had Isaak Sirko play the enemy for a couple of episodes, but pretty soon even hes just another friend that also knows the big secret and keeps it to himself, then dies anyway.<br /><br />5. Where was the creepy? Where was the mystery? Where was the WTF? Not one moment of any of the episodes ever had you guessing, shocked, confused or even on the edge of your chair for even 2 minutes.<br /><br />I believe the 8th season coming up may be the final one.  It really needs to be if this was indicative of all the show makers have left.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Really fun and entertainmen really recommend Will be fun feels like it's and endless amount of episode great use of money
034580404X|5.0|I loved these three books. I read them in a weekend. The story about a sadist and an innocent really rings through in these books. The romance grows and then it breaks apart, only to renew again. They end up happy, married and parents to children who know they are loved.

B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Zooming displays document clearly & legibly on a small screen, but the product comes up short on documentation.  The Getting Started pdf that downloads along with the app is required reading, although it doesn't explain some basic functions.  For example, it took me over a week to discover that there are text search and goto page # functions, which execute quickly & easily, once you know how (a finger tap to the middle of the screen opens up the toolbars, at which point you can learn the meaning of the icons by trial & error).  At the end of the pdf document an internet address is provided where you can get more information; unfortunately, the page doesn't exist.

B00003CXDB|5.0|Oliver Stone's Dad worked as a Stock Broker .  Which one of the actor's portrays Oliver Stone's dad?  For me, its Hal Holbrook.  Hal Holbrook's character was &#34;clean and ethical&#34;, and was the perfect &#34;fatherly foil&#34; for the energized Buddy(Charlie Sheen) who had to get his fingwers burnt just once to know that what Hal Holbrook said, was true.
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|It was well acted (mostly) and well directed (mostly) and I enjoyed it for sure.  The ending wasn't totally satisfying or make total sense but it wasn't bad.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|This movie had all the visual stimulation Hollywood loves to wow with and the plot was very similar to the book, but I can't help but feel there was something missing.<br />I was very impressed with the novel. So impressed, that when I found out a movie was being made, I was very excited to view it. However, it seemed that the focus was on main points not necessarily the same sort of focus the book portrayed. I may be more critical just because this is the way I interpreted the book, and to see the movie from such a different interpretation may have been where the disappointment stemmed from, but nevertheless I still finished the movie with an opinion that \\"nice, but if never watch that again.\\" Feeling.
B003K16PFU|5.0|A gripping first-person account of the Spanish Civil War. Orwell is at his best detailing the complexities of the conflict as well as the heroism and abuses.

B00005OWIU|5.0|Just what I expected, I love the composer and of course the soundtrack brings back memories of the movies and the characters, which is always good for us fans!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I will begin by saying that throughout the entire book, I wasn't sure if I wanted to smack Drew or kiss him...or smack him and then kiss him! Drew Evans is hands down one of the best characters I have ever read. Tangled by Emma Chase had me in stitches laughing so hard at what was coming out of his mouth. I laughed until I cried. And just when Drew has me wanting to strangle him, he goes and does the sweetest, most unbelievably romantic stuff that I just fell in love with him over and over again.<br />Tangled is written in the narrative POV of Drew. It begins with him lounging in his house having suffered the previous seven days from what he thinks is the flu. He then proceeds to tell the reader (I really felt as though I was sitting there having a conversation with him, Emma did that good of a job writing this book) about the past 4 months, and what brought him to his current condition.<br />Drew Evans is the quintessential ladies' man. He is tall, dark and handsome, and a very successful businessman. Drew doesn't have to work to get what he wants. Everything just falls into place for him.<br />Katherine \\"Kate\\" Brooks is a smart, beautiful woman that has worked hard to get where she is. She is ambitious and hardworking. She is a no-nonsense kind of woman who doesn't take bull from anyone.<br />So, when Kate begins working at Drew's father's investment firm, things become very interesting. Drew has rules regarding mingling work and pleasure, but this doesn't deter him from pursuing Kate. When Drew sets his sights on someone, he will have them.<br />The instant attraction and chemistry between them are unmistakable. Drew and Kate compliment each other in every way, that is except when they are at each other's throats in business competition.<br />I absolutely loved Drew and Kate in this book! Emma Chase has written two characters that are dynamic and completely believable. A book has never felt more real to me while reading. As I said, I really did feel like I was sitting across from Drew listening to him tell me his story, and it felt like he could see me as my face was making the expressions he was telling me not to make in the very next line. Awesome, amazing, passionate, incredible...there aren't enough words to accurately describe how much I loved this book.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Hey, okay so minecraft is a game where all your talents come to life. For example, it helps you artistically and mentally. I think that when people hear minecraft they think &quot;Oh, eww all you do is break blocks and run around in circles!&quot; Okay no that's wrong it makes your artistic skills and designer skills really come out. When I was about 12 and saw my 10 year old brother playing I was messing with him saying this game is for losers and you do nothing all day and he told me to play I decided to give it a try and it was an instant ADDICTION. I played on the Xbox at first and I got it in here when it was $4.00 for  a couple days and I bought it and my parents are upset because I am ALWAYS playing this it's crazy because I can't get my hands off. This game is freaking so fun, sometimes wish that minecraft was a real thing in real life lol. This is WORTH the money and the other 5 stars can tell you that also! Thank you minecraft crew for giving me a &quot;hobbie&quot; while concentrating on how my house looks or if lava and diamonds are around lol. Thanks again, hope this helps and isn't to long to read. &lt;3 #Mcfinest &lt;--- subscribe to them via YouTube!

B00CKOYVG8|1.0|This version is a failure. It isn't fun to compete this way! I just want to play like every other version before. This is attempt at something different was unnecessary when the formula you had worked perfectly before.

B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|How can people give this 5 stars. All you is fly move your device side to side and shoot. It is also way to hard to beat missions. Unless you spend actual money from your pocket that you can use, do not get this app. I love Iron Man the movies, those are awesome, but when it comes down to it, you need to be extremely good at fast games. You can unlock armor that looks cool, but takes forever unless you spend real money. This is a shout out to gameloft. Gameloft, you guys have amazing apps. This is the holy one that I do not like. If it is possible to upgrade this game, I say do it. Charge people. few bucks for it. Make the game play how you normally do with apps you have to buy. You have Iron Man, I recommend upgrading this app, I feel if you do upgrade, that you will make a lot of money l.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book, I am about to read the last book in a minute. Just imagine, this book being good, think about the movie. Well got to go read. I also recommend this book for any one who loves action and romance. GOT TO GO READ!!!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This was a reader's movie. By that I mean that those of us who read are almost always disappointed by the movie our beloved books generate. In this instance, I believe that a true \\"reader\\", even one who has never read the book, will almost immediately see the exquisite novel being woven together in the editing. It is a masterpiece of storytelling woven together via masterful editing. This movie is not for everyone and I too almost gave up on it in the first 30mins. But allow the character building needed at the beginning and the pay off is an emotional windfall for those in touch with their sense of destiny, belief in the inherent goodness of the human condition....and love. Prince said it best but there is indeed Joy in Repetition.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I'm not particularly a fan of war novels but I'm a little fascinated with James Bond and WW2. I was given this book in exchange for an honest review.<br />It was very action packed, through and through. A real page turner. I actually couldn't put it down. Definitely essential reading for any James Bond fan. I loved Damian Stevenson's first book 'Solstice' and this was also an exciting page turner. I will recommend this book to anyone looking for an exciting adventure to read!

B000OLGCI4|5.0|This was my daughter's favorite Disney movie when she was a toddler, and I bought it for her on VHS tape 20 years ago.  Amazingly enough, she asked me for the DVD version on her 23rd birthday!  I couldn't find it any where in stores though.  Thank you Phil Harris for selling this DVD on Amazon!
B008393Q2O|5.0|I got this so that I could keep track of my grocery list on my Kindle.  It's so much more convinent that using a pad of paper that I never can find when it's time to go to the store.  This app works very well and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

B009E3EY4M|4.0|I've read many of the reviews here. All seem to say that they are written by Led Zepplin fans. This makes sense for why else would you be reviewing this set if you were not a fan? The December 2007 show at London's O2 Arena has been something of a holy grail for many of us. The fact that it was finally being released in any format was a source of joy.<br /><br />Having heard the CD's and seen the Blu Ray Im left with a sort of confused feeling. Not on the part of the band nor on the production of the film but on the part of many who feel that they were somehow sold short by this set. In my opinion the set is quite solid. The song choice was excellent. Led Zepplin has always been able to take the blues and heavy rock and meld it into something unique and special. They do so here on many of the selections.<br /><br />One of the problems that has been associated with the set is that it is not of perfect sound quality. There are complaints that the bass is muddy, that Page is sloppy compared to studio versions of the material. I dont find this a great problem. It's a live show some 25 years post the last great studio album. People age its a fact of life. Robert Plant's vocals are a bit weak at times but it still does the job quite nicely. Jimmy Page is a great guitar player but he has always been a bit sloppy live. That is the nature of a live show. What he does on some of this materail is amazing in a cavern of a building like the O2 Arena. JohnPaul Jones bass can be muddy as it is fully centered in the front channels but this is how the band wanted it. His keyboards were and still are amazing. Jason Bonham seems to be a stronger drummer than his father was even if he looked a bit nervous at times.<br /><br />If I have a problem with the show its with the editing. This is a common issue with many viewers. I would rather see the concert and the band's interactions with each other than the million cuts between camaras but this too is  the way the band wanted the show captured.<br /><br />I for one enjoyed the performance and the presentation and feel lucky that there is a record of this reunion show even if it is not perfect as many wished it to be.
B00COGXX7A|4.0|I watched this movie along with my wife, and we enjoyed it.  It has a good storyline, with a little twist, although not one that will totally surprise you.  A good couple's movie for a date night.
B004X75RCW|4.0|Great romantic comedy.  Well done, great acting, fun to watch together.  Enjoyed the scenery, the actors, and the plot.  It was worth the $ we spent!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Omg where do I start with this amazing book? I haven't laughed that much or had a permanent smile on my face reading a book since &#34;Divorce Hotel&#34;. I ADORED this book and absolutely LOVED Drew. Yes he was a typical pig in the beginning but he met his match in Kate and now he is my new book boyfriend :) The dialogue and metaphors used were brilliant and hilarious (I laughed every time he referred to his Sister as &#34;The Bitch&#34;). I really enjoyed being able to have the male POV throughout the whole book. It was a nice refreshing change and even though there were some angst it still was light and funny. I seriously couldn't get enough of this book and didn't want it to end. I would definitely recommend this book if your looking for a fun, steamy read that will have you laughing your butt off and putting you in a good mood until the last page this book is for you! 5 Stars!!!<br /><br />*Some of my favorite lines*<br /><br />&#34; Crazy? Like you want to rip my shirt open again?&#34;<br />&#34;No. Crazy like the itch of a yeast infection that won't go away&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Water? Martha Stewart didn't say anything about water! That bitch!&#34;<br /><br />&#34;I get it now. Why Noah put together that art room for Allie. It wasn't because he was a vagina; it was because he didn't have a choice. She was it for him. No matter what he did, there was never gonna be anyone but her. So all he could do was set up the room and hope to God that she'd show up one day and use it. And that pretty much sums up exactly how I feel about you.&#34;
B00993FEUK|3.0|I was intrigued by the story idea for this animated feature, but the movie turned out to be pretty much just okay.  The animation is claymation-style and pretty well done, but the story could have used some tweaking.  It wasn't as funny as it should have been and got a bit too scary in places for some younger kids.<br /><br />Norman is the local strange kid because he sees ghosts and no one believes him.  He chats with his grandma as they watch tv together on a regular basis.  His town is preparing to celebrate the anniversary of an event from 300 years ago when the courts tried and executed a witch.  In fact, the town pretty much makes its tourist trade off of this past event (shades of Salem?).<br /><br />However, it turns out the story is true and that the witch is about to wake up and raise the dead (zombies) and punish the town.  Norman is called upon by his wacky uncle to take over as the one and only person who can stop this from happening, but nobody believes him...at first.<br /><br />There are some interesting twists to this movie and I won't spoil it by giving them away.  But the zombies are not quite what they seem and so is the witch.  Still, I'm not sure this is worth a second viewing and was glad I hadn't paid to see it in the theatre.  I think the script could have used one more re-write and there is some adult situations in the movie that might be bothersome to some parents.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|Loved the differing levels of play involved in the game. New venues kept it interesting and the occasional easier task helped keep me from being frustrated or getting burned out.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Didn't know what to expect. Pleasantly surprised. Beautiful graphics. Game keeps moving. Not impossible to play like some. Instead, it has a nice flow, and you can figure things out. Really enjoyable.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect when I started, but the game was good. I wish the map could be used to skip to a place directly, but otherwise, it was just fine. Challenging, good story. Good graphics, but the talking close ups were a little weird. Would recommend.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is a great game. I like that there is different modes that are all very fun. There is some things that might make some people not like it though. It takes just a little while to actually figure out  how to play. I think that the game is really good.
B007N8RULO|4.0|if it didn't randomly shut off every month or so__ I.d give it 5 stars. also,  wish it automatically filled in decks once you have the piles ordered up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the people who give this a 1 star are stupid they just don't get minecraft I guess but this game is so very epic.
0061743526|4.0|When Harper Lee's first and only novel, To Kill a Mockingbird was released in 1960, it shot forward as an immediate critical and commercial success. It has sold 30 million copies to date, and a Library of Congress survey ranked it as the second most influential book ever written, placing just behind the Bible. The reclusive author's tale of a \\"tired old town\\" in Alabama and the incidents that occurred there during the Great Depression has become the most widely read book in high school English classes, and its ever-present cultural impact gives no indication that this trend will recede. One cannot overstate the unbelievable praise that the book has received from organizations of every demographic, from the National Conference of Christians and Jews to the Publishing Triangle (where it was declared the 67th greatest lesbian and gay novel for reasons unexplained).<br />  However, there has always been a vocal opposition to Lee's crowning achievement, one that aptly points out the predictable, stale nature of the characters and the simplicity of the book's principal theme: \\"be nice to people.\\" Novelist Thomas Mallon dubbed the book \\"an ungainsayable endorser of the obvious.\\" Every year there are also numerous attempts by organizations of all walks of life to try unsuccessfully to get the book pulled from high school shelves and required reading lists for its vulgar language (the book makes use of the word \\"whore,\\" an epithet that most students could go their entire high school careers without hearing were it not for the novel).<br />  Despite these criticisms, Lee undeniably shows a mastery of language and storytelling in her novel. Most of this stems from the novel's protagonist and narrator Scout Finch, who beautifully describes Maycomb, Alabama as a place where \\"men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning; ladies bathed before noon, after their 3 o'clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frosting from sweating and sweet talcum.\\" Scout's fiery attitude and enlightened eye for social injustice make her a fitting narrator for a novel that attacks the established conservative society of a 1930's South built on racism, classism, and anti-intellectualism.<br />  Mockingbird makes these critiques on Southern social structure through a series of seemingly disjointed episodes that depict a town where your last name and skin color determine your innocence in court. While the book is frequently described as a book about \\"a White Southern lawyer defending a Black man falsely accused of rape,\\" that story is only a drop in the bucket compared to the larger themes present in tales of reclusive neighbors, vapid old women, children acting out scenes from Dracula, and yes, a Black man accused of rape.<br />  But the parable nature of the book's many stories yields it to be more story-driven than character-driven. Rightly or wrongly, Lee fails to add any second or third dimension to her characters. While he is often cited as one of the greatest literary heroes of all time, Atticus is unfortunately exactly that: he is the hero, and that one word describes every aspect of his being in perfect detail. If there is a right choice and a right choice, you don't have to think twice about which he will choose and which after-school special speech he will give to justify his choice. After Bob Ewell beats his own daughter, gets a Black man imprisoned unjustly, and spits in Atticus' face, Atticus just tells his children to \\"stand in Bob Ewell's shoes a minute.\\" Lee tries to complicate Atticus by having him a shoot a rabid dog in the street, finally showing us a hint of his dark side, but this is immediately dismissed and never brought up again for the remainder of the novel.<br />  In the opposite corner of the flat character ring we have Bob Ewell, our resident racist, child-abusing villain. Whether he's molesting his daughter or trying to kill children, his appearances are closely followed by Lee's commentary not-so-subtly screaming \\"Get it? He's the bad guy!\\" Ewell's exhaustively Disney-villain character detracts from Atticus' message that we should \\"stand in his shoes.\\" Lee makes him so despicable and un-relatable that it is far too daunting to try to empathize with him, and this prohibits us from trying to see two sides of the conflict.<br />  Also interesting is the fact that a novel that frequently explores racism suffers from The Last Samurai syndrome, as it is dominated solely by White protagonists and helpless Black victims. The Black population of Maycomb serves as the novel's \\"damsel in distress\\" that can only be rescued by the gallant white knight, Atticus. Contributing to this is the fact that the Black characters of Mockingbird are just as featureless as Atticus or Bob, but they are each assigned a stereotypical role that would make Jim Crow himself blush. Lee fills the novel with such antiquated caricatures as \\"the sassy Black cook\\" and \\"the simple-minded sharecropper\\" rather than populating it with any self-sufficient Black characters to contribute to the story.<br />  But, as mentioned, this lack of depth does not detract from the story's ability to weave satire and social commentary into an easy-to-swallow novel written from the perspective of a child. Although its shortcomings deserve some criticisms, Lee rightfully earned her Presidential Medal of Freedom for writing a book that hit so many hot-button issues present in America during the time in which it was written.g \\"Get it?

B007TKT2SK|5.0|I think this is probably one of the greatest calculators for this task that I have seen, in fact it is the only one I have seen that is for this function specifically. As for the poor reviews, I attribute them to jealousy or frustration at something else, probably a woman that is trying uselessly to get sexual attention from her husband or boyfriend, and the husband or boyfriend doesn't understand the woman's &quot;mood swings&quot; and grumpiness, and is pathetically trying to seek help in the wrong manner, by attacking this developer, when he should be putting it to his woman, in which she will be nice again. Problem solved, and didn't need to assassinate the character of the developer to do it. :-)

B0073COMKW|5.0|I had been looking for a bright bulb for the R20 downlights in my kitchen.  Although this is not a reflector type bulb, it is mostly 180 degree directional.  It has been perfect so far (after 2 weeks) for my purpose and I ordered some more.  The A19 shape fits into the R20 can very nicely, although with the heat sink inside the can, I don't know if this will shorten bulb life.  The light quality is just right for the kitchen at an advertised 3000K.  I don't know how to measure whether it meets the advertised 80 CRI, but it seemed to bring out colors well.  It looks like pure white light; I didn't notice any bluishness mentioned by another reviewer.  It easily matches, and I'd say exceeds, a 60 watt bulb which may be a function of its directionality.  It is not dimmable, but I have them in a circuit with a dimmer at full power and they seem to work fine; absolutely no noise or buzzing that had been reported for some other LEDs on dimmers.

B004I8WD6E|4.0|I'm writing this review after using an [[ASIN:B0042GNEN8 Iskin Solo Black For Apple Iphone 4G]] for a year and a half.  The Solo was a sort of aquamarine blue which I never really liked.  I much prefer this clear case, even though people here complain that it turns yellow eventually.  If that's the worst of it, I'll spend another $5 in six months :)  Compared to the Solo, this is a little less flexible, but is still grippy enough to stay put pretty well, while not being too sticky in your pocket.  The Solo covers the power and volume buttons; this case leaves them exposed.  I like the feel of the exposed buttons better, but of course they are probably more vulnerable to damage.  But I keep the phone by itself in my pocket so damage to these buttons is very unlikely, although dust could be a factor.  I really could do without the tacky concentric circle design, particularly seeing as some people say it scuffs the back.  Honestly though people, it's a phone not a work of art, and the circles probably provide some shock protection.  Overall, this case is very good at this price point.  Although the Solo is significantly better quality, it is still $24 as of this writing and is no longer available in the blue color I don't like anyway.  The Amazon case is not a quality match, but it is a better choice for me.  By the way, IMHO the screen protector is unnecessary and could be omitted.  The 4/4S face is not subject to scratches unless you really abuse it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Ignore what people are saying about it being boring. There's plenty of action and a lot more getting to know the characters. Even a love triangle

B004HWYTP4|5.0|Man, this was such a lame movie.  I knew how it was going to end almost as soon as it began.  I loved it!  The all star cast is just that, all star.  Every predictable line was wonderful, every gun fight bigger than life, every fight scene unbelievable.  A real Bruce Willis action spy thriller that is plain fun.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Season 2 of The Good Wife had a very good story line throughout and had great plots for each episode. A Completely brilliant show!
0312330855|5.0|Extremely well-written, compassionate narration of the life and dedication of a veterinarian, practicing his profession in the beautiful Dales in northern England.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Just got this game and I was having fun but then after a few rounds it keeps crashing. Not cool.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|Comes with a free voucher for a tf2 spy sapper that looks like wheatly, so basically pays for itself if you were going to buy one in the Tf2 store.  There may have been a DotA voucher in there as well, I don't remember...
B0099G4Y26|3.0|It's alright; nothing great, but of course I love Pink's voice.  There are only 3 songs I really care for on the album, and even those aren't mind-blowing, just good.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this show! Great cast and story line. This show makes me want to sit down and watch all the seasons at one setting!
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|I've loved Star Trek ever since I was a kid & watched the original series on TV. Now I have all the movies. This one arrived ahead of time, was as described, & is well worth the money. @ Thumbs up.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Kindle should let people know this cable is required at the time of purchase.  That way you won't feel like you have done something wrong.
B0049J3QF4|1.0|I tried for 10 minutes to find it on my Kindle.  I rented other movies and have not had this problem.  We never ended up watching it.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Lots of twists and turns! I, for one, feel that I have read just too many books about WWII. Perhaps that is why they fought the War so they could write books and make movies for the next seventy years..? But I am glad to have read this one!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|The game was a fun distraction when waiting. I found myself being a little calmer watching the fish swim. Silly, maybe...but true
006114665X|5.0|The first book that does a complete analysis of the pressures to which all the governments were subjected. Nobody foresaw the kind of catastrophe that was coming. A deeply moving and depressing book. A page turner written by a master of the historical narrative.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I really enjoy this game. Really takes me back in time. Has a real old school feel to it. I'd surely recommend this
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is really really neat and fun minute, cute little game to play and passes the time quickly when you're sitting in class with very little to do.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|was looking  for weather app that would give me weather for my town, but after  i got this it only gave me weather for towns 50 to 60 miles either side of where i live. they had bright sunny skies and i was getting soaked with rain andwind
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written book. Not the type of book I would usually read but this was intriguing. The book had a lot of twists which made me not want to put it down. Not going to lie the ending wasn't as crazy ad I was anticipating because everything leading up to it was crazy.  But I get the ending and what the author was  trying to convey. Even though the ending wasn't draw dropping I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend  it. Very creative piece of literature.
193700788X|5.0|Surprise, surprise... I like it.  I'm not going to write an entire book about why I liked this book.  I think it wrapped up the series nicely, tied all up all the loose ends, and I actually like that Sookie ended up with Sam - it took both their relationships throughout the series to realize they belong with one another.  I give it an A-.  Still a fan, Ms Harris!
B002HFJ77S|4.0|Great book! Definitely had me wanting to read more and more. It's obviously geared toward a teenage crowd but nonetheless a fun book! Sophie Kinsella never fails to give her readers something enjoyable and hilarious to read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the walking dead and it's nice that Amazon Prime offers it so that I can keep up to date on the episodes and not worry about falling behind.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Watched it mainly becaus of tom cruise. actually I thought it would be a run of mill Movie. I must say I was pleasently surprised. It's content was fast moving and had a good even flow from scene to scene.the language was less than you  would expect from an action movie. Hope He has a sequel!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I liked the first season so much. this one was a bit weirder with what all was going on. still liked it a lot though!
193700788X|2.0|Harris has lost the mystery. Motives were poor and ill thought out. Also why would carmichael want the cluviel dor to control amelia instead of just getting his soul back? Truly disappointed.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I'm not sure what i was expecting. maybe another type of Magic Piano? don't get me wrong its an easy to use app but i didn't care for it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|i like it because it is fun and kind of a little challenge for my and i like to challenge myself
B004U8ZH8S|3.0|I thought that it was ok, my wife liked it more that I did. I had hoped for something better.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This was a great book. I can't wait to watch the movie. Highly recommend this book. Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful writer.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I very much enjoyed the characters and the story line. Brandon created a good universe and finds very interesting ways of introducing a system of magic that leaves you intriged and asking questions. I am half tempted to read each book as it comes out, and I am half tempted to wait till 2020+ for the whole saga to be done and then read it all at once.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app loads quick and remembers where I was last so I don't have to do much than scroll up to now to see what is going on or has gone on.  Lets me read tweets and the links are quick, nice little app.
B00BSWMITK|3.0|Of course with Satriani you are going to get flawless performances recorded with perfect production quality, leaving just the actual songwriting as the ruler to measure the album by.<br /><br />I have pretty much every primary studio album Joe has made for U.S. release.  Every one of them has a couple of tunes that I get a craving to hear every so often, no matter how old or new the the album, whether it is &#34;Crushing Day&#34;, &#34;Friends&#34;, &#34;Cool #9&#34;, or &#34;Clouds Race Across the Sky&#34;. I can always find a song for my every mood.<br /><br />I'm not finding anything memorable here, the songs are &#34;vanilla&#34; and unmemorable; truly a first in my Satch experience. I see this album sitting on the shelf collecting a lot of dust that you won't find on the prior albums; not at my house anyway...
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I love a good fantasy story and when you take into account when this story was written it was brilliant but I don’t think it has weathered as well since there are so many other good stories out there.  The movie kept pretty well to the book and honestly gave a look to things I didn’t quite see that way when I read the books years ago.  The acting was on par with the writing but they were pretty and the scenes were well done giving the look I thought Mars might look like.  If it wasn’t Disney’ed as much (clothing?) it might have been a bit better and if there was a bit more straying from the original material I am sure there was a good movie in there even if the story wasn’t as strong as we have grown accustomed to.  I’d rent this but if the price is about what you would pay for a movie in your area it is decent by.  Though I am not sure I will have this as background noise as often as other SciFi favorites.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|Have always enjoyed this film.  It is one of my favorites.  I enjoy the genre a and the humor in it.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This is a great album and for $5 or so it is worth re-buying to get in a higher bit rate MP3 format, which is what I did.  Of course they sound as good as ever but they do sound slightly better if you are in Colorado or Washington and you happen to have lasers making pretty shapes on the ceiling of an observatory type dome.  Laser Floyd FTW!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Love the music.  May the hits keep coming.  They always find new ways to bring to life classical style music.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|If you like the feel of old movies before the days of cell phones, pants worn up around your waist and a tale of the kids that would one day grow up and make something like YouTube then this is the movie for you.  The kids were cute, a bit angsty and the tale of young love and loss was good.  Some of the action scenes were a bit odd as some things would get hurt or die while others would come out unscathed.  Of course if you can’t suspend belief for that to hold up then it might be the wrong movie for you.  Easy barometer for testing this movie, did you like the Crystal Skull story of Indian Jones?  If so you will love this one, if not, save a few bucks and catch something else.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I've gotten some pretty sweet deals over the years..... like, $10 for the $400 vacuum that makes my life a bit less dusty.... And the $10 Keurig that make my mornings a little less time consuming......<br />But the $10 I paid for the Of Monsters and Men album..... best buy I've ever made.<br />I've not heard a band this spectacular.... lyrically, artistically, uniquely creative.... I mean! Dang. So flipping genius. Are these folks gonna be this generations Pink Floyd?!? Not that the sound is ANYTHING comparable, but the lyrically complex stories, and the instrumental genius.... ..<br />The. Entire. Album. Is. Just. Amazing.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Cool little toy for making a picture I took with my phone a bit more interesting before posting it for friends and family to see.  Simple to use and quick.  I'd get this again if I have to change out my phone someday.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|kind of liked it
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Pixar has a good reputation for a reason, they make good stuff.  This time around they tackle the whole Mother vs Daughter relationship that always seems to happen.  The characters are fun a pacing is quick enough to keep the kids entertained but it lags at a few parts to add to all those story bits that the grownups that are watching it with the kiddos will enjoy as well.  Note I didn’t save “have to watch” as it is a good movie on its own merits and I don’t have any little ones to watch it with.  I am not sure if I would put this on for background noise as quick as I might any of the Toy Stories or the Incredibles, but a good movie for sure.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am a high school home school student, and this calculator is awesome! I can switch the different ways to use it when I need to. It is a calculator so it helps A LOT with math.... I would sooo recommend this app to everyone! I hope this helps you. :)
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|A true work of art by a great director David Lean with a cast of international stars that will never be seen again.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|But the reason I gave it 3 stars is cuz the stuff is so expensive. How do I buy things. When they are 1000 and I have 100 ?!
0385738765|3.0|This book is alright. It is absolutely in-line with the old saying, though. You can tell this is by the same author as the first book, but it's definitely not as good.<br />Plot: 4/5 It was an OK plot, but nothing special. It had its twists and turns, but there really were some parts I didn't like.<br />SPOILER<br />Tomas spends a good bit of this book passed out in the middle. First he's (accidentally) drugged out, then he get's shot and passes out all over again.<br />Characters: 3/5 They really didn't feel very real.<br />Setting: 5/5 The setting was definitely the best done part of this book. I feel like it absolutely could be real.<br />Writing style: 2/5 Seriously, all his slang is really getting on my nerves, and he doesn't make up for it.<br />SPOILER<br />There are so many crazy people in this book it sort of infects your mindset toward the book itself.<br />Total: 14/20 A good sequel, but not as good as the original.
B009NY43NY|1.0|One star is far too generous.I am disappointed in the lack of effort she put into writing this novel. If I could get a refund on my kindle order- I would!
B002ZG97RE|3.0|The combination of Director Greengrass and Mr. Damon has always been a stellar combination...but Green Zone puts them<br />in Iraq and even though there are guns and fighting etc etc...was rather boring.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My family loves this movie and we watch it all time time. Great story line and musics. My son now pretty much remembers the movie words by words!
B00BJOFU42|4.0|After the flat, disappointing 'Beautiful Future' Primal Scream return with one of their most consistently engaging efforts.  It took a few listens to get this one, as there isn't a 'Swastika Eyes' or 'Rocks' that immediately draws you into it.  And it starts off with a meandering 9-minute jam.  But I think it all holds up extremely well as an album.<br /><br />The influences are all here, of course - a bit of '70s Stones/Faces, some J&MC guitar squall, Suicide, Stone Roses... but somehow it all sounds freshly Screamish.<br /><br />There's loads of horns on this album, some free jazz elements, and it neither takes the retro road of 'Riot City' and 'Give Out...' nor the full-on electronics of 'XTRMNTR' and 'Evil Heat'.  It's more a car crash of all of them.  I'd recommend the Deluxe Edition because there's some goodies on disc 2.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Well Done!!<br />I like the way the game plays.  The challenge of figuring out the puzzles without instructions is awesome!  Anyone can make this app play out to suit his expertise at games.  I didn't have any problems downloading or playing.
B0009HAHD4|5.0|Checked Nikon D60 manual and it stated to buy the DK-20 so I did, but description did not state that it would fit on a D60 in the description. Took a chance and it did fit.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I am loving this series of books.  I am watching the series and reading the book at the same time.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|A good movie to have and to add to ur musical library. So if into musicals this is for u.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome I love it! If you like temple run then you will love subway surfers! Also everytime you update subway surfers the place changes! So far I have had Rio,Japan,and a regular subway place!(not the restaurant
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is fun and vaguely educational. I would suggest this for anyone with children however you should make sure the parental settings are on.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is the best Temple Run yet!  I love it and can't stop playing it!  I play for hours and I am so addicted.  I actually got it for my 6 yr old nephew but I keep taking over for him to show him all the cool graphics.  I love the balloon ride and going from land to land in the tornado tunnel.  It is so awesome!
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I really didn,t care about this &#34;friends&#34; of Angry birds.  I was nothing new and basically the same as the original Angry birds. I liked the birds in space better
B0087ITBPC|4.0|Whether this is the movie Barbra might have seen as an ideal return to the screen in a starring role, she has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.  This pairing of Seth Rogan and Barbra is almost a match made in heaven.  Seth is a strong enough personality to not be overshadowed by the power of Streisand's.  While the second half of the movie is absolutely charming, it's the first half that sets the tone of the story.  The viewer will have almost as much of an adventure crossing the country as its stars do.  So if you're looking for something light and fun, you just can't go wrong with \\"Guilt Trip.\\"  It left me hoping for a reteaming of the movie's two stars, for they definitely do have a chemistry.
0060574216|5.0|This book will surly help me in any future relationship-only wish I would have read it sooner.All young folks should read it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I am absolutely delighted with the bible on my kindle. Its easy to access. It will encourage me to increase my bible reading. Thanks Amazon.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My four year old grandson loved these dinos.  Very realistic and fairly expensive, but worth the price.  6 months later and they are still his favorite toy.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|Great movie soundtrack and love the musical Les Miserables.  This song is so uplifting and one can imagine what it would be like if everyone was fighting for that one great cause in life. Aspiring!!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This very enjoyable if often heart wrenching story of two lonely people of very different circumstances is wonderfully written. The descriptions, language and Twain-like use of dialect usually work very well and almost everything is relevant and revelatory. The plot is wonderfully crafted and fits together beautifully, if perhaps a bit too perfectly, but I like that sort of thing.<br /><br />The horror and sadness of the orphanages of nineteenth and 20th century Ireland is captured well and terrible to behold. If you have interest in Ireland based fiction, this is a real winner and recommended.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|This little dude is so cute it fits my kindle fire and it makes it look so cute I'm a pink fan so it's awesome.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I bought this for someone who wanted to borrow my copy.  The price was right and the DVD came in great shape.
1594488886|5.0|Hosseine is a superb storyteller. He is able to tell his stories without creating political conflict and still able to depict the horrors of war , he touches all of your senses and shows us the best and the worst pf mankind.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|Neede to purchase for someone else. Came in great shape and the price was right.<br />I would purchase from David again.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|the album is great, but the cd comes in a sleeve, and some of the songs skip but the album is wonderful i just wish the cd was more secure, and such
B004JKLBUU|5.0|Very Hungry Caterpillar a children's  book classic.  What more do you need to say other than it was one of my favorites.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is the second game I have from this company and I like them both. They're bot stable and don't require an internet connection, so it makes them perfect when I have 5 minutes to wait while picking up the kids.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|This book was so unique and interesting, i have never read anything like it ever and thought it was absolutly brilliant :)
B00AJER3SE|5.0|I wasn't to videophile savvy when I started my collection. So i wondered why there was another release of terminator. Specs are everything when it comes to blu ray. This new transfer is incredible. Things pop, colors are better and the contrast is amazing. I believe this is a 4k transfer as well. So you won't have to rebuy when things move to 4k.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|this is a great help with everything.... to homework and recipes!!! I definetly recomened this app for the free app of the day.... worth 99&cent; too!
B0060QM0AG|5.0|This is a great book. Author writes with great wit and compassionm for his subjects, both animal and human. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This was a Birthday gift and it was exactly what my son wanted.  He is enjoying it every evening after work.
B0060QM09M|5.0|Great writing, great story. Funny & heart-warming. I loved both the books in this series so fart, & will read everything else by the author that I can find.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I love this calculator.  It's the only one I use since I found it.  I use it for my furniture building.  Saves a ton of time.
B008RZF2I0|5.0|I was worried when Kamelot had to transition singers.  This album has done a fantastic job.  The songs work well and the singer is great.  Reminds me of Black Halo with how much I like EVERY song!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|it is very easy to use. i am able to download any video in high quality as long as it is available in high quality HD and all. great product
B009IEXKXI|3.0|This book would easily become a film, a low-budget hot seller.  Yes, the human struggle is adamant survival and this book delivers.  The content fills in where &#34;Mission to Mar&#34; left off.  It's not the best I've ever read, but was entertaining, and isn't that why we read. . . needs to be a movie.
030759565X|5.0|I love it! Some friends recommended it to me and I decided to give it a go. It's a very attractive book visually but the best is the way everything is explained. Very good for special and everyday meals.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I was looking for Mario bro. something I had a passion for, and this was the next best thing oooh I'm loving Mr.,bro. ,Cuzn,Lep THANKS.
B0099114WO|5.0|Maybe couples therapist should use this on their patients. It is an eye opener for couples in a rut!<br />Good movie!
0345803507|4.0|The book was in condition as he described it. It was almost new. I would like him to ship faster next time. It took almost two weeks to get here.
0544002318|4.0|I love the recipes that Scott includes in his book.  The information that he shares concerning ultra-running is very informative...
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love being able to keep up with my reading when I leave my kindle at home.  The program takes me to the last known place in the book I am reading - so I quickly get right to where I was in either my Kindle or on my phone
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Funny, relatable and heart wrenching all at once! A wonderful read.<br />You'll fall for Augustus just as Hazel did and cry profusely when he dies.<br />You can read it again and again... the story never gets old!
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I found that I liked the original one I had better than this one.  It does not charge while reading and is slow to charge when not reading.  The other cable was charging even as I read and it was so much faster.<br />I am not real thrilled with this cable.  I wish my original had not been stolen.
B00064VR0W|5.0|This DVD has all the songs I like. I am very pleased with this purchase. The sound is awesome and so are the images.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Wow!  I am stunned.  This \\"book\\" is so UNBELIEVABLY BAD that I'm almost at a loss to describe why this is the SINGLE WORST BOOK I've read in many years.  What a missed opportunity!<br /><br />In a single act of self-immolation, Charlaine Harris deserves thirteen NEGATIVE STARS, because all of her previous work is undone in one crashing horrific burning pile of crap.<br /><br />Is she really this lazy or did she get somebody else to write this for her?<br /><br />The plot is horrible and the writing is amateurish.  It makes no sense and is flat out ridiculous.  (Soulless beings, cliched attacks and quickie escapes, secondary and tertiary characters appearing and disappearing at random, are only the tip of the iceberg.)<br /><br />Major characters that were staples of the previous books barely rate a few paragraphs and even in those brief appearances they are pointless and unrecognizable in their behavior from what we've come to know about them and who they are supposed to be.<br /><br />Never mind the rushed ending and complete lack of sense to the ending.  Would it have killed the author to fill us in on what was going on in the Eric & Pam side of things?  Is it too much to ask that a series that up until now has had vampires at its core, fill us in on the goings on with some of our favorite characters?  Even Sookie doesn't feel, act, or speak like the Sookie we've come to know from the previous 12 books.<br /><br />All sense of fun, romance, and cozy Southern charm are completely absent.<br /><br />In October of 2013, \\"After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse\\" is supposed to come out.<br /><br />YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!  I WILL NEVER BUY OR READ ANYTHING ELSE THAT THIS POOR EXCUSE FOR A WRITER EVER PUTS OUT AGAIN.<br /><br />I regret that I ever wasted any time on this heifer's works in the first place.  If Ms. Harris thinks she can screw over her fans like this and expect them to keep supporting her, she is sorely mistaken.<br /><br />I didwonder if CH reads any of these reviews and what she thinks of them, but then again who cares about her anymore?<br /><br />I'm dumping all those books of hers that I bought into the library donation bin (except book 4 Dead To The World).  Hopefully it will stop some other poor soul from putting a few dollars in her pocket and wasting their own hard earned cash.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it. Play it every day no big deal to skip the ads. Would recommend this app to everyone.What more can you ask for,it's FREE.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the show and the streaming on Amazon.com was very good. Every once in a while the connection would be interrupted but that's to be expected and was only a few times. Great way to catch up on a TV show season!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I'm excited about having a new trilogy to read.  I really enjoyed this first book.<br />Looking forward to reading more from this author.
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|This movie kinda sucked the big one. Way too predictable and included some excruciatingly cheesy scenes.  I understand the lineage of this long standing star trek series/movies, however this one doesn't seem to capture that essence. Bottom line, some nice shiny CGI action scenes, but the story line is uninspiring and may prevent critical movies viewers from suspending their disbelief.  Though, if a shiny hollow shell is your thing, you'll love it.
B000GJPL1S|5.0|Yes, it's Keanu Reeves, but the store line is just fantastic.  Must see for Sci Fi and will become a classic for sci fi lovers
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I think this is a good app, but I think they should add an option for variables. Mostly because in high school fractions, you're lucky if you ever see a number.
B009LH1Y1W|3.0|My favorite show. Season 8 has some great episodes but also some of the worst. First part of the season a really mixed bag altho it picks up for the latter part. Getting a little tired of something always being wrong with Sam would love to see Dean be a focus for a change altho he is a major player with the guest stars and stand alone episodes.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I think it is fun to play and to get all the points you can in 60 seconds is hard and very addictive.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I'm so happy that this game finally been released on the kindle fire. I've been watching and playing this on friend's IPods and whatnot, and I'm already having fun! When I saw the &quot;please rate&quot; pop-up, and I realised that I forgot to rate, I went right over to the app page to rate 5 STARS! GET THIS GAME PEOPLE!!
1843106698|5.0|It has given me the information I need.  I would recommend it for teachers and parents who are living with or in contact with children or adults who  have this syndrome and need to understand how to deal with it to benefit all involved..
B009X00E18|5.0|This cover is perfect for the tablet. Fits great and doesn't take up a lot of room in my bag. I carry a laptop,portable scanner, Kindle tablet, a keyboard for the tablet and a kindle reader so it has to be think and light. This fits all of the above.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Childs is back at the top of his game after a couple of disappointments.  Reacher is perfect as the avenging angel.
1476715904|4.0|This book is way more PG than other books I have read, and that is fine.  It made me cry a lot because my mom had the same thing Layken's mom did and just brought back those same feelings. Hit really close to home in that respect. Very well written!
B00A5IXI7O|5.0|This seminal movie displays several Hitchcock touches found in many later films-- beautiful woman, distrust of police, chase, train travel, and humor. The camera work is brilliant.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This game is really cool, but there are in app purchases. I have this app and use it all the time. In it, you take care of animals.
0062082353|3.0|Kyle is not a professional writer, but his story reveals the training and mindset of a true American hero. Riviting!
B000683VI4|5.0|Be ready to laugh and cry. This is a very inspirational movie that I would recommend for teens and adults. Since receiving I have watched this movie several times. I received this movie promptly and was in excellent shape. I would recommend this seller.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Above My expectations? Yes it was. Good new songs (some not with Layne singing), a good album none the less.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Be ready to laugh and cry. This is a very inspirational movie that I would recommend for teens and adults. Sandra Bullock is wonderful in it as well as other cast. I received this movie promptly and was in excellent shape. I would recommend this seller.
B001QJUX24|3.0|There is now a movement afoot to make this THE great American movie.  It's hard to think of it as such with a handsome blue-eyed Indian chief, white Indian captive Natalie Wood with lipstick on, and some hokey stock western characters.<br /><br />On the other hand, the basic story as told by John Ford is compelling and honest about racism, John Wayne gives a great performance as Ethan Edwards, the main character, and the cinematography is beautiful.<br /><br />But In the end its flaws detract too much from The Searchers to place it at the pinnacle of American cinema.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I like this movie but not as well as the original Willie Wonka. However, it is a must see if you like the original to see a different twist. Johnny Depp is great in it. I received this movie promptly and was in excellent shape. I would recommend this seller.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Will be anxiously awaiting the third book of the trilogy.  Waited to read this one so that it was closer to the final book release.
B00AAQWMB4|1.0|In all honesty, for an app that is charging 99 cents (standard for a paid game app) it would be a little more professionally put together.  No intro screen, no menu screen, no options for the game.  No instructions.  Just... BAM!!! you're playing... good luck (and the app didn't even wish me that).  Talk about lack of information.  I didn't quite understand the concept of this game - especially after the color I was playing (red) ran out of legal moves, I was then forced to play another color.  The game wouldn't even end on it's own.  This game wasn't worth the FAOTD, let alone them wanting 99 cents.  Save your 99 cents and your time for another game.<br /><br />Worked fine on my Kindle Fire HD - well, for the 5 minutes it was on it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It was free and works; what more would I want?!  Gees, I have to have more words for this to go through, so here you go!
B009MYAQK4|2.0|Coelho is a wonderful writer but I was expecting an actual story. This book is more like a collection of wise parables. Still wise and enlightening but not a summer reading choice.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|The non-stop whirlwind of Mumford and Sons' tours has definitely influenced the sound of this album. Some of the self-concious meticulousness of Sigh No More has thankfully been swept away in a storm of foot stomping tunes that only make me hope to see these fellows live some day soon. This is very definitely a collection of songs for live performance rather than a finely crafted studio album, but that's exactly what most music lovers are after anyway. The question of Mumford's spirituality is again left vague, although more recent articles and interviews shed some more light on that. But this is very definitely a spiritual album, more than 'just' love songs.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I'm disappointed in this book. It felt like I was reading a reality tv episode. I felt like Collins was lazy and forced a third book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this app for my youngest daughter. She loves it. I enjoy it too. It's a lot of fun.
B003O86FMW|2.0|He second book of the hunger games trilogy was horrible. Collins basically re wrote the first book with a few twists, but not many. There was no originality and I felt like I wasted my time.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Graphics good, but after testing out this game for my grand kids I have to say \\" No!\\"  It sends the wrong message...graffiti is not OK! Just my opinion and now it's your choice.<br />Concerned Grandparent
B002NNA9N0|3.0|way too much unnecessary foul lanquage, it is a movie that really takes place in an office over a period of time..boring
B000K3M1VI|5.0|There is nothing wrong with this movie. It is beautifully written and gives loving attention to the depth of characters. Kline and Streep offer the best performances ever.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|Great kids movie, fun for all ages - if you are an animal lover, this is a great movie for you.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. Very old school. Lead actors did an excellent job. Kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|All around great gaming mouse i highly recommend it. Very customizable, high dpi, and you can even change the color ^_^
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I enjoyed this film. Well cast.Ben Affleck  did a very good job in this film. Held my interest through out.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think this is a great dictionary I really would let me peers use this to look up words I saw words I never saw before and know their meaning.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Thought it would be better based on reviews. So blame it on marketing. But still enjoyed. Did hold my interest.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Very informative and will be a handy tool when I am ready to format my book for Kindle publication:-)I can't wait to get started!
1439181780|5.0|the power of love and you will unlock many doors dont worry its not a spoiler its just a teaser!1 lol you have to read! great series of books.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a lot longer than I expected it to be. Like the Nancy Drew games I used to play on the computer. Fun:)
0316286850|3.0|so i purchased this book along with 2 other make up manuals, good for beginners not super in depth very basic.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I Choose this four star rating because it was a good follow up series to the Percy Jackson series... I would recommend this book to anyone who has a curios mind... Loved it and Leo was hilarious...
1582701709|5.0|i was so in love with this book i purchased some as gifts for my family and friends!! especially the ones that think they have a permanent grey cloud over their head.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|We LOVE Danzel Washington and have watched many of this movies, but this one fell short of his incredible talent.  We watched the movie and then gave it away, not worth watching again.
0316287059|3.0|so this book has how to's and looks for aging skin, which is a must. i wish it was a little more extensive.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Update! Did not realize this was an alternate universe so they can do whatever they want and they did! LOL! I wish they would have stated up front this was an alternate universe.<br /><br />This was an exciting watch but the deviation from the original Star Trek story line is a hard sell to those of us that watched the original series. How did Spock talk to Spock? The original Pike was a wheel chair victim  and not dead. How did Kahn get unthawed twice by the same Enterprise?<br /><br />But if you never watched the original or have forgetfulness then who cares. Go and enjoy the fun!
1451673442|5.0|yes you can, you can read you can believe and you can achieve!!!! i purchased these in a set the power, magic and the secret, and the power all have the same message positive thinking!!! dream boards set goals for your self and don't dwell on negative and what you don't have
B004ZN9UZO|2.0|This is a great CD  track 1 plays well all other tracks skip. Iplayed it in different cd players all the same,
0446581356|4.0|very happy with this purchase would have been 6 stars if  the book would have came with all the brushes and make up talked about in the book!!! just kidding, but it would have been real nice!!!!!! i like how the book breaks down what you need in your kit and what items you should splurge on. what brushes to use and when
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The third book was a little predictable, but otherwise it had many thought provoking elements.  This is certainly worth reading while considering worldwide resource shortages.
B00ALKRVTM|5.0|Having seen how big and heavy the print book is in the book shop, and how small the font is, I decided to wait until it was available on Kindle and I am so glad I did! The kindle makes reading this book a pleasure and as I am an avid Agatha Christie  I am really enjoying this book. It seems to go on forever so definitely value for money.<br /><br />I would recommend anyone interested in this book to get the electronic version as the print book is quite bulk, has small font and I imagine would be fairly heavy to carry around.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I didn't think this movie was going to be as good as it was, but it was so touching and really funny. I recommend it to anyone. Don't let the fact that it has subtitles fool you. Would you watch Good Will Hunting? Cause it was as good as that.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Pretty cool game. Good graphics for a handheld game. Runs fairly smooth too. Looks about as good as ps2 games did. A great way to waste some time. Definitely not for kids thou.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I have to say Bradly Cooper amazed me in this movie. I can see why he was nominated and he did an awesome job.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I like this book , To think that you could want to be with someone so deeply that you're willing to give up everything.
0062119044|3.0|So I feel compelled to review this book, and not just rate it. I am really shocked that this book has a 4/5 star average actually. The only reason I have given it even 3 stars is because it got very good towards the end. But, I felt that this book took too long to get into. The beginning was slow, boring, and had nothing to do with the plot of the story. I felt that about the first 100 or so pages weren't even necessary, even to establish backstory. Sure, the parts about Kevin as a child were important, but not all the stuff in between.<br /><br />I also didn't like how this book was written in letters. Throughout the whole book I was wondering, \\"why are all the letters from Eva to Franklin, but no letters have been reciprocated from him?\\" Finally, in the final pages, they explain why this is, but then that just adds a whole new set of questions. Also, even when she asks Kevin \\"Just tell me why,\\" he won't give her an answer, so we never learn why he did what he did. Kevin himself even admitted that he didn't know anymore. In the beginning of the book she was too loquacious and it took away from the story because I spent so much time looking up what the words meant. It should have just been written in first person narrators perception instead of in a set of letters. That's what threw me off. To be honest, I really didn't like this book until the last 100 pages or so. Until I got to that point I was just slogging through and waiting to be done with it It felt like it got dragged on and on. Also, the dad's perception of Kevin throughout this whole affair was a little unrealistic, he couldn't seem to see any of the bad stuff Kevin did, even though it was obvious.<br /><br />Anyway, I would not recommend this book unless you want to feel like you are trudging through mud, where you know you can see the end of the bog but it just feels like you can't get there no matter how much you want to. I hate not finishing books once I've invested time in them, so I felt obligated to finish it, but it wasn't that great. But I do have to say, it wasn't horrible.
B008LSVLVA|5.0|This arrived 2 days after I saw Steven Wilson live on &#34;The Raven Who Refused To Sing&#34;  tour, so I was anxious to see the differences between this tour and the new 2013 tour.  Let me sum it up:  This video is a masterpiece, hope they release a live Raven<br />tour video.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|So much fun and such amazingly great graphics! I would gladly  pay for this app! I would highly recommend it to everyone!!  It's not too easy but just hard enough to keep it interesting!! Please hurry with the next one!!!
0060919760|5.0|Very analytical and updated ego and social themes. Not a common self help book. It requires  big dose of self analysis/
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I hated this book. But I loved it. It made  me cry. I hated it soo much. I hate it with  a passion. But it was amazing.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Obviously I really don't care about what haters say, I know this album is awesome and my fave songs off this album. are<br />Heart attack<br />Made in the USA<br />Without the love<br />Neon lights<br />Nightingale<br />Really don't care<br />Fire starter<br />Never been hurt, I downloaded this free u won't regret it
B007TKT2SK|5.0|What a great interface,  and marvelous execution of an app.  Working flawlessly on my Photon.  Simple,  and perfect.  5 stars
B00BP4WAZS|1.0|The movie kept stopping and buffering. A waste of time & money.<br />Went to Netflix and didn't have any problems streaming a movie.<br />We will not attempt to use this feature again.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This was one of those rare times that a movie is actually as good as the book.  I would watch this again.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Absolutely the best and most user friendly fraction calculator I have ever used. I am a woodworkers and I can't begin to tell you how glad I am I found this. Thank you!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Mainly, I didn't care for the acting.  I can appreciate wanting to portray Lincoln as a gentle, wise man, who spent many an hour in soul-searching agonies, but the acting seemed weak and understated to me.  Lincoln, as portrayed in this movie, did nothing to endear me to him.
1401937519|5.0|A wonderful and life affirming book! I strongly recommend this book to everyone who has questioned what is possible in the realms of health and healing. Reading this book confirmed for me the incredible opportunity we have everyday to truly live life from a place of inner peace and allowing.
193700788X|1.0|Was this book even written by the same person who wrote 1-9, because the person who wrote this knows nothing about the characters SHE CREATED! As if Eric would have just let himself get pushed around, as if Sookie would swear that much! Oh and what about the fact that Sookie could always read Sam's mind despite him being a shapeshifter, since that seems to have magically disappeared.<br /><br />All I can say is, I had a lot more fun reading the 1 star reviews given by your fans, because clearly they know and love the books and characters a lot more than you. But why should you care, right? Dating a vampire is stupid according to you. You've got your money, and all we have is this rubbish, after 12 years.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Wonderfully thought out; so full of surprises. The viewer is constantly held in suspense not knowing what is going to happen to the characters. Great story line.
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|I downloaded this game twice and both times it stopped working as i got to the end  no more BIG FISH GAMES
B008XG1X18|5.0|I don't know how I would make it without this app. I use on my kindle fire while I cook to have the recipes I've pinned on hand.
1594203334|3.0|I ordered this book from Amazon but ended up returning it after reading the first chapter - which was all about the author's pregnany and not really written in an engaging manner. She is self-deprecating, but not witty, and the details of her life are pretty boring.  I did end up checking the book out of the library and enjoyed the anecdotes about French parenting. She should have stuck to her journalism roots, cut out the stuff about herself and her husband, and made it a series of vignettes of the French people in her book. I might have kept that book.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Finally a calculator that will allow you to do school math problems without have to convert from fractions to decimal.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is game is so much fun and addicting! I love to play it and it keeps me entertained. The kids also like the game.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I was very impressed with Kelly singing ablity on this CD.  She cerntainly has grown since her Idol days.  Keep it up Kelly
B001ILFUDM|5.0|I will decide how many words if any are appropriate. No you. No further comment is required. I purchased the item so be happy with that.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This a great movie for the whole family.  Never tire of watching it.  Love those little yellow guys.  Can't wait for Despicale Me 2 on July 3rd
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Learned more about the Iraq war and the seals and the  brave soldiers who fought there I think chris Kyle is or was a rare soldier.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Loved the historical correctness of the series.  Good combination of actors and an interesting subject filled with war and sexually scandals.
B00CC1K320|2.0|Initially i was very happy and i would have given it much higher rating.<br /><br />Look very good but the problem is only after 1 week of use the glue from the bottom edges started to come off.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Really easy to use.<br />The interface is clean and you can accomplish what you need pretty quick<br />Good<br />I like the buttons design and the  quick overlay for instructions
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calculator and downloaded this one. It  works great. I have to write nine more words so hope this is enough.
B000002UCN|5.0|there are so many great songs, also the sound quality is really good. I would recommend it to anyone. buy this cd
B002361MLA|5.0|A wonderful easy to follow book that reveals the truth. Eckhart Tolle has used his own experiences to deliver an amazing truth about life and how to live it.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|If you like jigsaw puzzles and tanagram s then you'll find this app to be a new favorite.  BEAUTIFUL picture puzzles that are challenging and really fun and relaxing to complete with many levels. Hours of &quot;Zen&quot; time that is both relaxing and holds your interest. I hope Big Fish will add additional levels. Here's an app that's worth every penny!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is the best mouse I ever owned.  The price was even better.  Very comfortable.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B0088X7YMS|3.0|It was okay not great. I prefer live actors to anime personally. But still a decent movie in the spirit of the others in this franchise.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is really the best  way to be close to what you love if you love horses<br />Like me I love horses so this game is awesome
B006S053K8|4.0|Liked the movie. Its just something silly to watch and enjoy. Worth the time and low cost for a few laughs.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I am a fan of murder mysteries and have been reading more international ones since many US authors feel a bit stale.  This author and this series have been great.  Warning: not all of the books are available in English yet.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|If you watch the show you know its great. One of the best on TV if you never seen it then here is your chance.
B008N1V11U|2.0|Did not like the gameplay at all.... too repetitive .. same actions over and over... the graphics are ok.... and the dodging system is cheap
B00005JLF5|5.0|The first season sets up everything that will happen later. If your into sci-fi then you will like deep space nine.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I selected this book because I heard of the Tesla Motor Company now producing electric cars and wanted to see if there was a connection.  Talk about a genius before his time! His work and ethic are inspirational!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|One of the Best shows on TV. If you haven't seen it then buy this and you will be hooked!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|realistic and fun :) ive ridden horses for years and this game gets it down even to the horse and riders movements... very well done anyone who likes animals or horses should get this game.
1419702238|5.0|My son of 9, who does not like to read at all. I basically make him read. Thankfully these books are on his AR list (3 pts each at 3rd grade) and eagerly and quickly reads them. 2-3 days his reading is complete. He has thoroughly enjoyed these books. The humor is somewhat low brow, but the kids love it.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|rod is always good a and the songs are wonderful. put me in a good mood for a long time  will never tire of this
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's great for me. I can see the temperature of wherever I am.<br />It comes in handy for me with my kid so I know what to put her in.
B00766CLPI|4.0|a bit boring, her voice as usual was amazing.. a little bit to classical for my taste  the songs  were too long
1935597760|5.0|I bought this book on a whim, but I thoroughly enjoyed the richness of the characters, and the unbelieveable story of triumph over adversity for the main character, Jamie McCloone.  I could not be satisfied until I finished the story.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|michael never puts a foot wrong  , Great variety of songs each one is a masterpiece. His voice is a work of art
B004MC8CA2|1.0|What I didn't like about this app was that if you were not connected to the internet you couldn't use most of the functions (jump from one book or passage to another, highlight text, etc). Stopped using it and am using another now.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This app is good, I've been playing this game for a long time. It really does runs smoothly. The transitions are good as well.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Beautifully done. Dramatic, colorful and spectacular acting. Very graphic but historically correct. A very enchanting series. Brandon Rhys-Myers is simply amazing!!
B000002U82|5.0|I have this album on record & cassette , Had to have the CD for my car. I recommend this Cd too all that love Pink Floyd !
B003VW8GT6|5.0|This is one of John Wayne's best movie's and I could watch it numerous times. Walter Brennan<br />'s plays a character named &#34;Stumpy&#34; and steals the scene in several scenes.
B000007S5B|5.0|This CD is one for putting on my big headphones and laying on the floor . Make your brain go back in the past !! Don't need drugs for a high , Just  buy this CD and lay back. Just as Described  !!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so hooked, but now very sad that I have to wait almost a year for season 4.  I am sad how the season ended.  But still a huge fan.
B00766CLPI|4.0|Like the LP without hiss and pops.  Nice song selection.  Must have for fans of Barbara.  Great liner notes.  Quality product.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am so hooked on Downton Abbey....I am on to season three.  Just purchased it and can't wait to watch it:)
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|Better that some Bowie albums but not a 5 star.  Lots of variety.  Lots of material.  Some songs are repetitious.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|By f2f hug and the eyes of duty in the world offering a chance it was not a movie about the chainsaw texas rangers book
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Dvds all play great.  love this show - perfect travel companion - not a better way to spend some time - awesome show.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I am happy to see that a movie of this nature was made here in the US. You only see this kind of film coming from foreign medias and to have the all star cast that it to boot. Good movie...
B001NHNG64|4.0|Good summer read, book was quick and entertaining.  The characters are really good and seems the book was well researched.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This backpack is very well padded and has sufficient space for the camera body and a couple of lenses. Lots of pockets for other accessories as well.  Very comfortable to wear also. I would have given it 5 stars but I have one complaint.It is hard to tell from the picture but all of the zipper pulls have Amazon written on them. This pack is like a multi tag advertisement for Amazon and they can not be removed. I think that is a little cheesy but not a deal breaker. Other than that, for the price it is a great camera pack.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I enjoy this game. I have played many versions and I like this one and prefer this one to others that I have played. You  should try it and see for yourself how much fun it is. It has several different set ups so you have different challenges, and when you have played them all you can purchase more games with different themes. A great way to kill time. Enjoy !
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|I think of &#34;Memphis&#34; as the third part of a sort of trilogy that begin with Boz Scaggs' &#34;Some Change&#34; (1994) and &#34;Come on Home&#34; (1997).  This is music for grownups, informed by soul and the blues, with a natural, rootsy, earthy appeal -- good songs played by mature musicians and sung by an experienced vocalist who knows how to convey what a song is actually about.  Much credit to producer/drummer Steve Jordan for his efforts, and you can't be too surprised that sessions featuring Ray Parker, Jr. (look him up -- he played on a lot of things before he did &#34;Ghostbusters&#34;), Willie Weeks and Spooner Oldham, among others, sound so good.<br /><br />A highlight for me is &#34;Gone Baby Gone,&#34; an Al Green-style tune written by Scaggs that establishes just the right tone for this collection of songs (&#34;album,&#34; for those too young to remember or care).  I'm a big fan of Willy DeVille, and Scaggs' engaging version of &#34;Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl&#34; casts some deserving light on the work of the late performer and song writer.  And while I happen to like DeVille's menacing interpretation of &#34;Cadillac Walk&#34; more, Scaggs' more rollicking take of the Moon Martin song is another highlight here.  The gentle take on &#34;Corrina, Corrina&#34; is a change of pace that might quietly insinuate itself into your brain and/or heart.<br /><br />Think of the title &#34;Memphis&#34; as a signpost that this is more Royal Studios in Memphis than &#34;Silk Degrees&#34; in the 1970s ... although fans of that album and &#34;70s Boz&#34; can like this a lot if they're willing to give Scaggs and his team a chance.  New fans are welcome, as well, and should find a lot to like here.<br /><br />This is music of and for the long haul.  &#34;Memphis&#34; will grow on you, if you let it.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Comfortable, light (but adjustable if you want it heavy), and well-designed. The thumb rest is nice, and the 3 programmable buttons are perfectly placed. My thumb fits right over the two on the outside and right under the one on the inside. they're not annoying (been using it for about 3 months at this point), and they're easier to hit than a specific button on the keyboard, so they're great for gaming (I use melee so much more because of it in shooters). I'd easily buy another if this one broke right now.
B0091REZMW|4.0|so addicting!!! cant stop playing it... just wish it was compatible with the new galaxy s4. I had to start all over on my kindle
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Super good book lived every moment of it. Definitely sad and much more emotional than the other ones. But it went out with a bang
193700788X|3.0|I was very much looking forward to this, and was sad to hear it was the last book in the series, but feel it fell rather flat.  Anticlimactic.  I think Charlaine just wanted to provide some type of ending to the story-line.  Brought back some characters, and introduced others, unnecessarily; story would've functioned w/o them.  Not the ending one would've expected given the history of the series - of which I've been a major fan.  Overall, disappointing ending to a great series.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I beat the whole game  and I still have fun u can compare  it 2 gta so if u like gta get it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, enjoyed the mystery got stuck at some points but loved it. The only disappointment was just the fact that it was too short.
B008Y1YJ90|4.0|I never saw this in the theatres and rented it on Amazon for 24hrs and we ended up watching it over and ove again.  Eventually I bought a copy so we could see it whenever we wanted.  This movie is touching, funny, action packed and fun for everyone.<br />You will love it!  Promise.
B000024KRO|5.0|Purpendicular is a stand alone introductory masterpiece to DP's future. This album consists of the bands Mk VII lineup featuring the infamous Steve Morse on guitar. The songs are very well constructed and the music is filled with ferociously driven guitar work with edgy melodic angles and a crafty blend of instrumentation which can only be expected by the remaining Mk II members. If you are a long time fan of the band or simply looking for fresh new sounds this album (along with all the other albums that proceed) is highly recommended. Enjoy!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this! It was challenging to work, very neat to look at and the background music was very enjoyable.<br />Really different hope they create more !!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game rocks I play this game everyday I would recommend this to every body ty and I hope u can do something to make this better in the feature
0812982622|5.0|A must read for every citizen of the world. An amazing, enthralling novel that works on every level. 20+ years ago, I studied northeast Asian politics in college and that background only enhanced my previous perceptions of everyday \\"life\\" in \\"Democratic\\" North Korea.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The Good Wife has good writing, good plotting, good acting, interesting characters -- all of that puts in the top tier of tv shows.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Director Christopher Nolan delivers a most satisfying conclusion to his critically acclaimed superhero saga with the highly anticipated blockbuster sequel The Dark Knight Rises. It's been eight years since the death of DA Harvey Dent and billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a broken recluse, abandoning his crusade against crime and corruption as the vigilante known as Batman. When the masked terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy) threatens Gotham City, Bruce Wayne knows that the Batman is needed, but to stop Bane's nefarious plan to destroy Gotham City he forms an uneasy alliance with the skilled cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). The Dark Knight Rises not only ranks as one of the best movies of 2012, but is also one of the finest superhero movies to hit the big screen. This thrilling cinematic spectacle is worthy follow-up to its acclaimed predecessor The Dark Knight, featuring an intricate storyline, solid performances, skillful direction and first-rate action sequences. The cast also includes Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine.<br /><br />Warner Brothers knows how to give its blockbusters a solid Blu-Ray presentation, and this 2-disc edition will surely standout with repeat viewings. The Dark Knight Rises is presented in 2.40:1 and 1.78:1 (IMAX sequences) aspect ratios. The picture quality is certainly striking with notable detail and rich colors. Its 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track delivers that home theater experience that you've come to expect from most big screen summer movie. The 2-disc edition comes with an abundance of behind-the-scenes featurettes that deeply explore many of key elements of the film's production. It also features four trailers and an art gallery of posters and designs. Overall, The Dark Knight Rises scores an \\"A\\".
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome hope it has many more seasons<br />Can not stop watching it highly recommended. Check out the first series onwards addictive.
1575666286|5.0|I watch the documentary on youtube so i order, it was good info and serve as a guide for me.<br />I am not sick  (that i know) but this was a good reference for me, i recomend the book and the seller, superfast delivery.
B001QJUX24|5.0|After Casa Blanca, The Searchers, is my second favorite movie. I feel it's the best movie John Wayne ever starred in. And who can forget the role that the young Natalie Wood played. An all around strong cast, and great movie...
B0073PPKNM|5.0|Melody Gardot has to date released two impressive albums (`My One And Only Thrill' and `Worrisome Heart') in which she delivered beautiful, heartfelt songs in her trademark low slow voice that rarely rises above a whisper but carries so much passion and dignity that it forces itself to be heard. My one small criticism (and it is a small one) is that there was very little variation in the tracks across both albums. With her third release, The Absence, she has addressed this and produced her greatest album.<br /><br />Teaming up with Heitor Pereira, she has moved away from the smoky blues/chanteuse style of her earlier albums to embrace a more Latin feel. She is now using a slightly richer backing, tinged with Latin rhythms. She breathes her way through delicate and delightful tracks that speak of love, life and loss. It's slow, but with an infectious beat. And then suddenly, unexpectedly we get `Goodbye' where she picks up the pace and puts a little more power into her voice to give us something different and unexpected. It's a welcome break from the slower mood of the rest of the album, it works well and it is good to see her pushing her boundaries.<br /><br />THis review has also been posted on the vinyl version. On vinyl it is another level. The added dynamics lets you hear the colour and intonation in Gardot's voice. It becomes a more intimate experience than the CD version.<br /><br />It's a simply gorgeous album, and thoroughly deserves every success. It just has to be 5 stars.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|my favorite book and i love having it on my ipad now! Glad I bought it! Its perfect for my ipad library
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this on my kindle fire &amp; it is one of only a handful of apps I have never uninstalled or stored in the cloud. I had 1 1/2 years of illness requiring multiple weekly doctor &amp; hospital visits &amp; this has been my favorite game app. I love how smoothly it plays &amp; the fact it is so easy to see. you can customize colors to better suit any lighting or visual needs. this a game that allows you to play on autopilot when you need to. a meditative &amp; zen experience for long waiting room hours
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|I rented this movie hoping to view it over the course of a vacation, but I totally missed about half of it and it expired before I finished. I recommend buying over the rental.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Thank you bfg. I go through every game of this genre I can find fast. I had some previous disappointing experiences with big fish games however my most recent purchases have been great &amp; this is the best so far. Can hardly wait for the sequel. The quality of this game is wonderful &amp; a MUCH appreciated value. while I cant deny the quality of many of my g5 game purchases their price is hard to choke down and big fish has Provence they are every bit as great PLUS A BETTER PRICE! Just cant be better than this. I play on<br />my kindle fire &amp; this played smoothly with great art good story &amp; zoom hint &amp; skip functions &amp; a most pleasing mix of game play hog &amp; puzzles will definately buy more!
B008XG1X18|4.0|My phone doesn't allow for me to use the app in the same manner in which I do at home on my laptop...THEN I actually go to the sites that are linked to the images BEFORE I repin. When using the app, I tend not to go to the site, I just repin with the intent to verify the site later at home. I don't use the app even close to the amount I use the full version at home. The app is a time-killer while waiting for friends at the coffee shop or trying to look busy at the bus stop :)
B00C2VGAW2|4.0|This soundtrack is really great, and a lot of the songs fit perfectly with the Great Gatsby as a whole... i.e. there are no songs that make you go \\"wtf? what does this have to do with Gatsby at all?!\\"<br />I'll just start with the tracks that I didn't like, which pretty much only amounts to two: \\"Bang Bang\\" by Will.i.am and \\"Love is Blindness\\" by Jack White. Will's song just is disappointing... and not because it's modern hiphop/pop, which appears somewhat on the rest of this album, but because it lacks any artistry behind it and just falls flat for me. And Jack White's cover of U2, while highly praised, was just not for me personally. It was a little bit too scream-y  at points and just wasn't my musical taste. However, it may be exactly to your liking.<br />Now... songs which made this soundtrack exceptional... Florence + The Machine's \\"Over the Love\\" is absolutely amazing, and it is perhaps the song which draws the most upon The Great Gatsby itself for inspiration and just seems to fit the whole movie and book really well. It was awkwardly placed in the movie, but the track if fantastic. \\"Into the Past\\" is absolutely beautiful. It just floats in the air, and it feels very light and beautiful. Great track overall. And finally.... Lana Del Rey's \\"Young and Beautiful.\\" I am a personal fan of Lana, and this track measures up perfectly with the rest of her songs. It is dark. It is cinematic. It is beautiful. This soundtrack is practically worth buying just for this track.<br />some other notable tracks include Beyonce's cover of Amy Winehouse, as well as Emeli Sande's cover of Beyonce's \\"Crazy in Love\\", which has really great arranging and is just an amazing reimagining of the classic track.  Overall, great soundtrack, though it does fall flat on some tracks.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It continually works great, I have found it to have no glitches or problems. Despite it being used on such a small screen (vs. a laptop) the graphics/operation is VERY similar to the full version of the game. Love those cute little plants and those relentless little Zombs!
B003V1WTMM|4.0|This was the second Kate Morton novel I read and I enjoyed The Forgotten Garden more.  Distant Hours seemed a little longer than necessary.  I grew a little weary hearing about the 3 sisters' problems. Maybe it was just my mood as I read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is an amazing game. Fun but challenging. Highly recommend it for all ages. You will immediately get hooked. Hard to put it down.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|I have read 3 of Morton's novels and I would rate The Forgotten Garden as my favorite.  The House at Riverton would be second.  I liked the mix of generations and characters better in Forgotten Garden.
B00AEFZ8OY|5.0|This is another funny as H E double Hockey sticks movie from the South Park guys.  I think it's just a funny movie to watch when you have nothing to do and are just going insane from the boredom.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the mystery and after a little speculation and thought, the ending was probably the only way it could end.
0896760278|3.0|This book has great detailed drawings and info BUT you must have an advanced skill in sewing in order to use it.
B00013M6NK|5.0|This item fits in my Nikon camera P510.  I have not had any problems with it.  I rec'd it quickly.
630233683X|5.0|The VHS tape was in great quality. The show was entertaining and the storyline was superb. Well worth the money!
0783240287|5.0|I have always enjoyed the play and they did a good job with the video.  I watched it with my 8 and 14 year old grandchildren and they love the music.
B0091REZMW|5.0|fun game and easy to play. haven't had problems that other reviewers have described. still have plenty of play options each time I enter game.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I'm not a pro, and will not review each song like that, but think that some of them have arrangement, recording and/or mixing issues.  For example: the song: \\"e ti prometteró\\" uses something like a pad electronic instrument that smears and obstaculizes the main voices clarity in the middle frequencies, and the final mixing result is not the best for Laura Pausini and Josh Groban voices (sound backwards).<br />Also, in some \\"forte\\" and high passages (climax passages) I can hear the harsh trace of what I think is the excessive voice recording compression (for example in \\"The moon is a harsh mistress\\" minute 2:28)<br />Josh Groban in this album shows a new more wide and open vibrato I never heard before in other Groban's albums. \\"The moon is a harsh mistress\\" is a good example of this.  Good for him (and for us).<br />I Think that Josh Groban voice goes very well with acoustic instrumentation, and the electronic synthesized sounds in this production are too much present for my taste, but is a personal oppinion, just that.<br />Josh album allways shows a strong emphasis in songs with a positive message,and this is not the exeption, \\"Un Alma más\\" is an example of that.<br />Beside any criticism, is a good album and is worth while for us, Josh followers like me.
B00932A4XE|3.0|This movie has a lot going on! Maybe a little to much! I normally like Cameron Diaz but i think they could have cut her out and the movie would have been better off!  On that note w/ cutting her they could have made Chris Rocks part bigger! Elizabeth Banks was definitely the best part of this movie!!! She was comedic gold especially in the guest speaker part at the kids expo!<br /><br />So was it worth watching....yes, but glad i waited till it was free on Amazon Prime!!!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This is a really cute game however they charge you an arm and a leg to complete the game.  I will not spend real money for play money I any game.  I much prefer to grind versus cheating but this game doesn't even make grinding realistic.  Too bad as they have a really cute concept here but too expensive to play in a timely manner.
B005FDW7AI|4.0|I would recommend this for family viewing; but I also enjoyed it myself.  It had a delightful cast of characters, including the woman villain.
0060245867|5.0|Very cute.  It's a classic and we enjoy reading this book at bedtime.  A nice book to have in your child's collection.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|The story gets extremely graphic at times, but it is the real story of Frank's life.  It is amazing that despite all Frank McCourt went through as a child, he succeeded in life.
B00AHQNHSY|3.0|For that reason alone, I like it alot. The user interface is a little complex, you have to load/search for the videos. It's not very difficult, just redundant, If I searched for them once, why do I have to search and load again everytime. It's free, so no big deal.
0810989956|4.0|Trying to keep him from tv, video's I got him this book to help with idle time and he loves it.
193700788X|4.0|I've been reading Sookie Stackhouse novels since 2002 and she has always felt like an old friend to me. I like this final chapter because it shows that Sookie has finally grown up and no longer is codependent on dangerous and selfish men. She has finally come into her own and has found self acceptance.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played I use to have it for my tablet but it broke.... when I got this kindle it didn't have it at first and mow I'm glad it does now
B001UV4XIS|5.0|DVD arrived in good condition! The movie of course was great, just like the books! Though of course sad at the same time due to deaths of certain individuals and that it is the last Harry potter movie were going to get!
B00AAKZPUK|5.0|I've always loved this movie and it was great to be able to watch it again. Interesting to see all the technology changes from today.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Eccleston is a great Doctor. The only negative thing about this season is the fact that it ends with him leaving. Don't get me wrong--Tennant was terrific, but like many other fans I would have loved to see Eccleston stick around for at least one more series.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love this Case.  With other Bluetooth, I spent too much time trying to find it in my purse. When I did, it was either dead or broken. Now this case has made my life that much easier. Thank you!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|If you feel not want to live on this planet anymore, this toy could take you into another world! Mind blown toy!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Entertaining, real, engaging.<br /><br />This movie was so much better than I expected.  If you are wondering if you should watch it... just do.  The story is great, the acting is very authentic.
0374203032|3.0|\\"Do we want a society where everything is for sale?\\" Sandel has written a book full of examples of where we are becoming a market driven society. But this book avoids the meatier issue of how we became this way -- and how to reverse course.<br /><br />Adam Smith, author of The Wealth of Nations, was first and above all a moral philosopher. He would be appalled at how the question of \\"What's the right price?\\" in today's society has replaced the more important question of, \\"What's the right thing to do?\\"<br /><br />Only on his penultimate page does Sandel get at the heart of the matter for another book: \\"For fear of disagreement, we hesitate to bring our moral and spiritual convictions into the public square. But shrinking from these questions does not leave them undecided. It simply means that markets will decide them for us. This is the lesson of the last three decades. The era of market triumphalism has coincided with a time when public discourse has largely been empty of moral and spiritual substance.\\"
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you enjoy a storytelling where all points of view are valued and explored then your choice has been met. From start to finish you will not be disappointed. Wit, charm, tragedy, and gritty reality, it's escapism worth your time!
B00005RDRO|5.0|This is a very funny movie with a lot of stars.  We'd seen it long ago and were really happy to be able to purchase it to have in our collection.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|great movie well put together. i stayed on the edge of my seat the whole time<br />so intense how he functions
B00993FEUK|1.0|I would not recommend this movie to anyone - especially kids. I put it on for my grandson (4 years old) and had to turn it off. It was not funny and was very much on the gross side. When the dead body of a large man fell on top of the little boy and his tongue was all over the boy's face, that was the last straw. The way the little boy (Norman) treated this dead man's body was horrific. We turned it off and threw out the DVD. My grandson was glad it was gone. Found this to be totally unacceptable for kids and not funny for adults.
B00ATX7FLA|5.0|Love the concept. It's Lego, what's not to love. These are great to hang from the ceiling and create an action scene.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Explains scientifically why carbs are bad. I've changed my eating habits and hope to see results soon. I want to buy copies for everyone I know. This book is fantastic!

B004XWMXW4|4.0|I got this as a gift for my brother whose a cellist in his schools orchestra and he loved it.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Used this in my $600 build with a Sapphire Radeon 7850 and 8gb of RAM and an ASUS H61 micro ATI MB. Get 80+ FPS on League of Legends with Max settings. Plays Tomb Raider and Bioshock Infinite at 45-55 FPS High Settings. No issues to speak of. I would however go with the i5 if you are doing editting or higher CPU demanding tasks. I dont so I didn't.
B0067EKYS6|5.0|While reading The Great Gatsby in school my imagination went wild putting faces to characters while trying to fathom the extravagant parties Gatsby threw. I imagined the roaring twenties meets mardi-gras. Confetti and beads, flapper girls and zoot suits, alcohol and speak easies... everything the twenties had to offer a lonely, hopelessly in love millionaire. The first movie was a huge disappointment. In fact, I fell asleep while watching it. The book was more exciting and I couldn't stand my teachers attempt to make The Great Gatsby less of a hassle by forcing us to watch this god awful movie... but THIS version! Oh my god this version of the movie was PERFECT! Everything I hoped for! Leonardo Dicaprio did a fantastic job as Gatsby and the actress for Daisy blew my mind. All the characters were spot on, even the extras. The parties were explosive and they didn't leave out any details of the book. They did try to modernize it a bit by mixing rap/hip hop in with some less than classical genres but it sort of worked. What would anyone in the twenty first century expect? A black and white film about a millionaire without some over the top tidbits? If anyone can appreciate a good movie based on a book it's me and I make a habit of reading or re-reading the book before I watch a movie. This movie was great! I'm buying it the day it comes out and I may even see it in theaters again. At the very very very least, 4 stars, because there was one really nasty black woman that kept \\"twerking\\" during some of the party scenes. Without her the movie would have been dynamite xD
B000QFCD2W|5.0|didaeverything king diamond does is gold reccomend this album. i cant wait to get some more of is albums including mercyful fate
0425263916|5.0|I always love reading books in a series, especially when you do not have to wait for them to arrive. This book arrived the same day as the other one and I was able to read them both without having to wait on the mail....GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book!!! Couldn't put the book down! Love Nicholas sparks! Onto the next Nicholas sparks book! I would recommend this!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|As a long time fan I was happy to finally receive season 7.  What can I say, if you love Dexter, you'll love the 7th Season.  My only regret is that there will only be one more season before the show goes off the air.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Spoiler alert!<br />While I agree with some points of the other reviews I have read, I disagree with others.  Absolutely loved the first books in this series and was an Eric fan from the beginning.  Having said that, I have to say that I never thought Sookie could legitimately have her \\"happy ever after\\" with either vampire.  Sookie being who she was written as couldwould not ha e allows herself to be turned, she even made Bill promise to let her die rather than to turn her in case of a fatal injury.<br /><br />The first 9-10 books of the series had great plots great characters, the last ones; not so much.  This one less so.  Rather than a really interesting plot and characters it felt more like the Ms Harris' only purpose was to tie up loose ends and kill off all bad guys.  There were some inconsistencys such as since when would a regular bullet kill a fairy?  I thought Ms Harris had written in that only iron, lemonds or decapitation yet Claude was killed by a simple bullet.<br /><br />On th whole, I don't think there could have been a different ending.  In fact. I pretty much expected Sookie to end up with Sam.  I disagree with the reviewers whole claim the relationship between these two came out of left field.  I thought Ms Harris hinted at deeper feelings between Sookie and Sam in several books.  Also at least one reviewer<br /> claimed that Sookie had been able to \\"read\\" Sam in the past.  I don't believe this is true.  Soloist could only get snatches of thought, feelings and or attitudes just like in this book.  Sam is a shifter and Sokkie can't really read. shifters or wheres.<br /><br />Over all based on the last couple of books this one was about what I expected, not the 5 that the first ones were but not nearly as bad as some of reviews I read.  Now that the series has ended I would still tell Ms Harris thank you for the series and I understand her point that through out thseries Sookie and Sam were always meant to end up together.
0394800389|5.0|I think each and every Dr Suess book is terrific including this one. I love that there are more than one stories included in this book and for such a great price. Cant be beat! If your child is a fan of Dr Suess he or she will be sure to love this book!

B008NEVPCC|5.0|You have to keep listening to a few of these songs to like them, but for the rest, they're perfect! This album never gets old!
B009DP9D6A|3.0|I'm a big deadmau5 fan and usually love the mixes.  This one took a while for me to get into and seemed a bit staid.  Nothing memorable on this disc like others before it.  Good background noise when I'm working and a good beat, but just expected a little more.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|90% of this game consists of the following:<br />Tap on one or more dinosaurs.<br />Tap on one or more harbors (dino food).<br />Buy X structure.<br />Move X structure.<br />Wait.<br /><br />The other 10% is mostly &quot;research&quot;:<br />This means &quot;play the slot machine mini-game.&ldquo;  I figure it takes maybe 20 tries on average for me to get past the one button bandit.  You know, science!<br /><br />As others have said, you do not ever have to spend real money to proceed, but it tries very hard to encourage you to do so.  If you do give in, you are rewarded with high prices for not much gain.<br /><br />There is very little depth to any of it, just a slowly progressing virtual terrarium of dinosaurs.  No sim like qualities, even though this could have made for an interesting take on the Theme Park type games.  It is a pretty nice looking terrarium though, so if that's all you're looking for, enjoy!  If you want something more engaging, or don't like it trying to constantly fleece your pockets, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Even if you find it only &quot;meh&quot; don't be surprised to find that you've somehow spent several hours playing...  It seems to just happen.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this for my daughter,​ and she loves it. Big Dr. Who fans, she and I. This was the perfect gift for her.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great puzzle game that can be as difficult or easy as you would to make it depending upon your use of clues. It's definitely worth the little cost!
B0002O7XW2|5.0|I made a comment to my granddaughter about Christine and she said &#34;what's that?&#34;, so I bought it and we watched it together, she loved it as much as I always have!  Great movie for adults and teens to see together!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Read for book club. All there enjoyed it.  Great work of fiction but did have lot of factual things in it.
0446691437|5.0|I had this book recommended to me by a very dear friend who is no longer with us.  Taken from us by that evil monster, cancer.  But she loved this book and LIVED this book in her art and her life.  I, too, truly love the message in these pages.  I'm a multi-published author in fiction and non-fiction and this book changed by life and got me working better and smarter, not harder.  The message is concise and very simple, yet makes you think about how you approach your art whether it be music, writing, painting, whatever.  HIGHLY recommended read...own the book and get a digital copy to have on your phone or ereader at anytime.  It's THAT good.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app. Stuck in the car or at the doctors office, time just flies by when you have this app. Grand kids love it too.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|\\"Crazy doesn't fall far from the tree,\\" might be the theme of this very funny film.  Oh, but you may want to add, \\"But who cares, as long as you're having fun?\\"  (I generally look for a strong theme in a film, and if I can't find one, then I consider that to be a bad sign.  This one did have a strong theme to me, perhaps different from the one that I came up with, but it should be noted that, just because I find a theme doesn't mean that I necessarily agree with it.  Doesn't matter.  But that would be an argument for another day. . . .)<br /><br />I really like the way that Robert De Niro's career -- or make that \\"careers\\" -- have gone.  After all, it seems that within film, he's had two:  the I'm-gonna-kick-your-tail films early on, and then the I'm-gonna-make-you-laugh films later on.  I think that he's been really good at both; you surely can't call him a one-trick pony.  I think that sometimes, people underestimate him on his comedic timing; I think it's almost perfect.  And I really liked him in all those \\"Meet the Focker\\" films, even though I thought that that series was surely drawing diminishing returns towards the end.<br /><br />And this film reminds me of a Ben Stiller film, but without the mean spiritedness of it all.  You have to admit, Mr. Stiller's films, while being very funny, can dive a little too deep into the depths of humiliation.  This film does not go in that direction.  Sure, it shows the weaknesses of our two protagonists -- and there are surely many -- but it never makes fun of those characters.  Instead, the audience always has empathy for Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, and that was a very wise move.  Wise enough to get Ms. Lawrence an Academy Award, one that I think she probably deserved here.<br /><br />I do have to admit that I believe that some of Ms. Lawrence's films in the past have been somewhat overrated.  \\"The Burning Plain\\" was nearly unwatchable (I reviewed that film awhile back and hated the non-linear narrative); \\"Winter's Bone,\\" while being good, surely wasn't great (I used to stay in the Ozarks every summer as a kid with an uncle, and the people were nothing like those portrayed in that film); and \\"The Hunger Games\\" was perhaps only as good as the \\"Twilight\\" series.  But in my opinion, \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is probably her best performance and her best film.  By far.<br /><br />Well, with apologies, you'd have to be crazy not to put this film on your Wish List.  And perhaps crazier not to make that final purchase and watch it.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I don't really want to write 20 words Amazon.  I just want to say \\"Wow\\".  I don't know why I'm just discovering this series but I'm so glad I have. I am speechless and am taking a deep breath before I dive into the next book of the series.
193700788X|5.0|I have read every book and watched the TV series with anticipation, but the books are so much better than the TV series and this being the last book answered every question and tied up all the loose ends - loved it!

B00BNWWUDY|4.0|From the opening shot--which duplicates the opening camerawork of PSYCHO--SIDE EFFECTS plays out like a by-the-numbers tribute to Alfred Hitchcock.  We have the strong female protagonist and a befuddled but determined male lead; duplicitous supporting characters; and a third-act twist that, if you know your Hitchcock, you can see coming, but is still a nice revelation nonetheless.<br /><br />The plot is predictably complicated: Emily's (Rooney Mara) husband is finally getting released from jail, where he's been doing time for some white collar crimes (take that, Wall Street!).  When Martin (Channing Tatum) gets out, Emily, instead of being overjoyed, drives her car into a wall.  Chance--or is it?--leads her to psychiatrist Jonathan Banks (Jude Law), who gives her a new medicine he's been encouraged to prescribe.  Things get better initially--Emily's sex drive is given a jump start, for one--but then turn very sour very quickly.  (I shan't give away more, although the trailers more or less spoiled certain plot elements.)<br /><br />Steven Soderbergh has his legions of fans.  Personally, I've never been blown away by his work; he has his good films (OCEAN'S 11, TRAFFIC) and his stinkers (OCEANS 12 and 13).  SIDE EFFECTS is the first of his films I've seen that doesn't really feel like a Soderbergh film, probably because so much emphasis is upon paying Hitchcock his due homage.  The plot rolls along at a decent pace, and there's a nice change of focus about halfway through, where the film shifts from Mara's shoulders to Law's.  Both actors give riveting performances; the same can be said of the supporting cast, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones as Emily's past psychiatrist.  (Yes, even Tatum continues this career upswing he's been on, proving that he's actually a good actor, and not just eye candy for the ladies.)  The script is solid; none of the twists are really mind-blowing, as perhaps they're meant to be, but the dialogue is decent, upheld by the caliber of performances.<br /><br />If anything, this is SIDE EFFECTS' main weakness: it doesn't have much to offer on its own.  Sure, the acting is solid, and there's some nice social commentary (about twenty years too late, but what the heck), but the film is basically a reworking of the basic Hitchcock tropes.  So basically, if you know your film history, you might not be able to get too far into this one.  However, if you're a determined Soderbergh fan (the man's been over-hyped, but there's no denying he has talent), or if you are unfamiliar with the Master of Suspense, you my find something new in SIDE EFFECTS.  Otherwise, the movie is a solid tribute, but perhaps could have been more than the sum of its parts.nces.<br /><br />If anything, this is SIDE EFFECTS' main weakness: it doesn't have much to offer on its own.

B003PPDBQ2|5.0|This story mesmerized me right from the start - I just could not put it down.  The story was so different from anything I have read before and I became totally immersed in it.  I was Beatrice her grief was so real.  I felt for her and grieved with her  It was so well written short sharp sentences but vividly descriptive and very believable. All the characters were well researched and the final twist was so well done. The ending left this reader in suspense I so wanted Beatrice to survive!<br />This is a good book for a book group.  So many issues to explore.  The role of the police; the doctors; research projects.  The loss of a family member and the grieving process that follows.
B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|Some people will make the choice to find this film treasure.  Some people will make the choice to find this film trash.  And this would be just like most if not all of the characters in \\"Cloud Atlas:\\"  most of them at one point or another are required to make a choice, usually do one thing or another.  And they realize at the time that, whatever choice they make, it will most likely be the wrong one.  In chess terminology, they would be mired in a state of \\"Zugzwang.\\"<br /><br />This film doesn't seem to have just one theme, but rather seems to be full of Big Ideas.  (That second set of people that I mentioned above will think it's full of something else, but I naturally digress.)  Some of those Ideas seem to be assertions, while some of those Ideas seem to be more like questions.  Questions that the filmmakers can't answer themselves.  Questions that no one can or probably ever will be able to answer.  I'll start with the assertions:<br /><br />A1.  When faced with a dilemma, make the choice that is the most ethical.<br />A2.  Everyone in life needs an advocate, or someone that looks out for him or her.<br />A3.  There are some things worth dying for.<br /><br />Now I'll list some of the questions:<br /><br />Q1.  What is the definition of life?  We on Earth seem to think we know the answer to this question, but if we saw life on another planet, if that life was vastly different from us, would we recognize it?<br />Q2.  (Related to Q1)  Could a machine be considered to be \\"alive\\" if it were \\"self aware\\"?  And what is self awareness anyways?  \\"Someone\\" in the film even seems to address self awareness \\"itself:\\"  \\"The only way to know oneself is through the eyes of another.\\"<br />Q3.  Does reincarnation exist?  And even if it doesn't, does the \\"memory\\" of the Universe seem to \\"remember\\" us anyway?  (This one's a little fuzzy to me but it seems to come up at a few points.)<br /><br />I'll admit, I only took a couple of Philosophy classes in college, and one of those classes was really more like a math class in the sense that we were required to take logic equations and simplify them, or prove they were valid or invalid.  It would be interesting to see what some Philosophy majors have to say about this film, overall.  Anyone?<br /><br />But with regards to the film, I'm leaning more towards the \\"treasure\\" camp myself.  As a matter of fact, I believe that time will be very kind to this film; I believe that critics in the future will warm up to this film and recognize its importance, at least from a philosophical viewpoint.  But naturally I could very well be wrong; people in the future may find this film to be more, well, trash.
B005ETA5K2|4.0|We have a boat and the marina offers wireless. However we seem to be right between two or three access points. We could see perhaps two at a time, sometimes authenticate, but never keep the signal. We tried another name-brand external adapter but it didn't help.<br /><br />We read the description and some of the reviews on this adapter and figured we'd give it a try. We received and installed this adapter on a Windows 7 machine without a hitch. I now have good to excellent signal and decent performance - can't ask for much more than that. We will probably purchase another so we can both be on-line when needed.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|I get to the last song and I want it to keep going. If you're a Porcupine Tree or No-Man fan then you'll like this release.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|There is a lot of action and my favorite character is snake eyes even though he doesn't talk. there is alot of science to and war
0345529057|5.0|This is an amazing series. George R.R. Martin's perspective writing style is truly unique. You get to experience the intricate world he has created through the egos of many different characters, taking character development to a whole new level. His writing style can be a bit tedious at time, you may find yourself reading an entire chapter about Catelyn climbing up some stairs, but almost every chapter ends on an exciting or revealing note that keeps you hooked. The general story in it's entirety is surprising and exhilarating. The series is filled with history and subtle allusions to many secret things that you might not expect at first, leaving MUCH room for theorizing about what's to come!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is worth downloading. The graphics are amazing. And the music is just really soothing and relaxing. I highly recommend this app to people who love awesome games like this one.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Nobody wants to be the Red Shirt Guy.<br />That never turns out well.<br />But, what if you are?  Well, you try to fix that, and damn quick!
B002X3V4P2|4.0|Nice mix of all of her music. A great buy for anyone who really loves Enya or Celtic music. Happy.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love seeing Rumpy and Belle enjoy Loves True Kiss before Rumpy and the gang sail off to new adventures<br /><br />Fun to see the Evil Queen try to save Storybrooke.<br /><br />Amazing how the writers have stayed true and (relatively) consistent with the shows original vision.<br /><br />Can't wait for season Three
B0091REZMW|3.0|I was hoping it would be challenging.However it was very redundant. The dark room with a flashlight was also quite irritating.
0553801473|5.0|I can't decide if this book is better than the third one or not, but it's definitely amongst my top two of this series!
B004PR71JC|5.0|We ALL love to sing to these songs; gramma and granddaughters.  Even grampa.  Not one bad song on entire disc.  Great beats and happy songs.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I read this several years ago when It was first out in hardback.  I've re-read it recently and also listened to the abridged version (the only available version at the time) on audio.  I'm sure the movie will be fun, but the book isn't an action packed thrill ride.  It's thoughtful, sad, disturbing, and hopeful all at the same time.  It's many different perspectives and you feel for each of them.  See the movie for the action and effects, read the book for the story.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great app, works good, simple and easy to use interface...and the best part is it is free! No complaints...recommended this app go sure.
1449410243|4.0|An amusing, easy read of primarily cartoons and very short notes on the quirkiness of cats.  This book is a fun gift for the cat lover.  However, it could easily be read in one enjoyable sitting (an hour or so).
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Not a very good movie.  Denzel Washington is outstanding as usual, however, the story leaves a great deal to be desired.  I DO NOT recommend this movie at all.  Wait for the comic book, it'll probably be much better!
B00AYQNOFI|5.0|This film is visually stunning and culturally provocative. I had never seen a film such as this before and it opened up an entire genre of movies for me.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I found this very interesting and was riveted to the TV until it was over. It brought out some interesting &#34;life&#34; values, and was a story of great courage and ultimately, faith.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|its a fun game but the pearls take to long to get unless you want to buy them. I enjoy the graphics!  they are outstanding!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Some good reminders of things we should already know, but also some interesting points and perspectives I hadn't thought of. Easy read, it went by so fast.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|At first you may find it difficult to follow.  You are shown brief segments of periods in time throughout centuries and people that are dealing with various dilemnas in their lives.  As we see more pieces in the puzzle shapes start to form in our mind about how the people are similar in different periods of time, but how sometimes they are good, sometime not so good, and sometimes outright evil.  It wasn't until about halfway into this long movie that I started to \\"get it\\" about the meteor tattoo, the characters relating to one another across time and space, and what the overall key actions were.  Don't worry, by the end you should have a pretty good idea about the people, the message, and whether it made you happy and cry.<br /><br />I liked it enough to buy and plan to revisit it soon armed with knowledge at the start so that I may key in on other aspects I may have overlooked the first time.  Great acting, directing, camera work, locations, special effects, and music.  I recommend this movie for the story and the beautiful way it is presented.  Although I found the jumping from one time to another confusing at first, it did not keep me any less glued to my seat. It is not for the whole family.  Children should not be allowed because of scenes of violence and sex.  Because of the cost of renting I suggest you go ahead and buy the HD online copy or get it on Blu-ray disc.  Chances are you will like it and want to see it multiple times.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B008M4MB8K Blade Runner (30th Anniversary Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B001TOCCRU Doctor Zhivago Anniversary Edition (Blu-ray Book Packaging)]], and [[ASIN:B0018O50VQ How the West Was Won (Blu-ray Book Packaging)]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Fun Movie.  I don't think it would be one that I would want to own and watch over and over again, however, for a one time it wan't bad.  Your mileage may vary...!
B001XUKFAQ|4.0|Tropic thunder is one of those movies you hate to love. It’s super corny, yet super funny and it has tom cruise being everyone’s favorite character to hate. Also, it’s highly quotable but there are some dry moments however the film doesn’t take itself seriously at all which lends to the fun of the movie. It’s a good laugh and you don’t even have to be a ben stiller fan.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Although I found the acting to be great, all the politics in this story bordered a bit on boredom for me. Unless you're really in to politics and how the wheels work, I don't recommend this.
B00007GZR5|5.0|It was a wonderful movie I loved when it first came out many years ago. I read the book in less than2 hours and had to get the video. It was spectacular it mirrored the images of the movie so very well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I saw the movie before I got the book. I just loved reading this because it felt real! I think we all had moments like Charlie growing up! Now one of my favorite books!
B000646MNE|5.0|This was one of the best purchases I have ever made! Came in the mail in perfect condition and have had no problems with the discs! Worth the price!
B0070R40V6|4.0|If you blend some Lord of the Rings with a little bit of medieval history, and add a dash of Steven King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series, you are starting to get an idea of style, genre and setting. Could not put this book down. A 700 plus page tome downed in almost 4 days is an indication of the story addiction. Great characters and very good (if somewhat simplistic) plot makes for a 4 Star rating.Started the 2nd book already and it seems there are at least 5 ... Shew!
B00321MGPG|5.0|I love this series, the brilliant colors the excellent narration the way they seduce your interest into the world around you. Planet Earth doesn’t pull punches. They inform you as to what animals have to do to survive then they show you how nature enacts that survival in all its savage beauty. I would recommend this show for any nature lover who wants to know more about the world.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|I had not seen the movie prior to this. I was used to all the beautiful singing in the televised musicals. The sets and drama were perfect, but from a musical standpoint --don't buy this movie for the music you will likely be disappointed.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Loved it it kept me guessing. Dan Brown at his finest. Can't wait for Inferno. The best of the Robert Langdon series.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was inspirational and passionate. As a woman who loves her career, I found this book to be very encouraging.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|The game itself it fun, I just think that the iron man franchise along with the new graphic abilities of tablets had a lot more potential than just a runner
B00AREIAI8|4.0|even know im not very far into the game,  its still really good .  and iv only had it for a few days.
B007428UN6|3.0|EPIC KUNG FU ACTION! This film is in the same vein as fearless or crouching tiger hidden dragon. The semi episodic nature of the movie gives the viewer the feel that you are actually watching a few different movies all in one. This is strength and a weakness for this film; you’re never bored by watching it however they never truly develop the supporting cast in any meaningful way. I live the movie and I would recommend if for the kung fu fan, if you enjoyed movies like the 36th chambers of shaolin or the original kung fu then I feel this movie is for you.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|A great read.  I highly recommend this book to those who have enjoyed the other &#34;Girl&#34; books.  You will love this one!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is awesome game u sholud GET THIS GAME IT IS AWSOME BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO KILL THE MAN!!!!!!:)
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|The show is kind of boring and predictable.  Every week it seems to be pretty much the same thing, the bad guys are always 2 steps a head of the local police, FBI and any other law enforcement agency..
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The idea of finding someone who fits you so easily in Vegas none the less is appealing , finding two people who are horrible at love and end up getting married first then finding love is priceless. This is such a quick read but its really cute I love the humor that is in this book good read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this little app is the next best thing to the &#34;bigger&#34; edition. My little man loves to build different house, so easy to use. so much fun!
B0091X4HQA|5.0|This is the best movie ever made.  I have seen every movie on IMDBs top 100 and this film is amazing, it has something for everyone and if you are that weird extraterrestrial that doesn’t like it for some reason then your broken and need to seek repairs because your alien robot brain is malfunctioning.
0385349947|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book because she's a strong powerful woman.  However, having read a lot of business books and having been a business major for 6 years of college education, I only learned one thing from this book.  When there's a meeting, sit at the table with the men!  Everything else in this book just felt like filler noise to me.  If you need another woman in the corporate world to reiterate the things you have been through, then here ya go..this is the book.  But if you're looking for concrete advice on how to deal with a crappy boss or bad coworker or how to out compete the men in the workplace, I don't know that this book will cut it.<br /><br />This book would be good for say a 20 yr old woman going to college or in her early twenties just entering the workforce. I'm 43 and I've been there done that.  Yah I'm not working for facebook, but I have always been a working mother.  If anything, Sandberg does give some good advice on keeping your family strong despite working.  I might have benefitted from that if I were younger.  My son is now nearly 21 and out on his own.  I did make time for him on the weekends, he was the priority for me.<br /><br />I came to this book a bit too late, that's all.
0544002318|4.0|Born to Run was better. But it is inspiring and got me interested in eating clean again. Worth a read.
B001G70M6S|5.0|I came across an old Polaroid 210 Land Camera. This film is great very forgiving with latitude and has a wonderfully tight grain. Perfect in its contrast dark dark blacks and brilliant whites. Very fun film to shoot with.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really had a great time playing Angry Birds Free.  It was easy to download on my Kindle and I would recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game was way too easy. I believe they would make it harder, but guess not. i hope they consider making a super one, i need more of a challenge.
0380789035|5.0|I’ve been a Gaiman fan since his Sandman days and he ever disappoints this book is an absorbing read. Like with all things Gaiman, you’re forced to continue because you have to know more.  I recommend this book if you’re a terry pratchett fan or you like some of the lighter dean koontz stuff and also of course if you follow Neil like I have then any of this books I would suggest you read.
B000YCIJRK|5.0|I have read this book over and over and will still read it, very quick read and makes my day.
B003L77G6A|5.0|What a fantastic combination of characters.  My wife and I watch two of these episodes every night for dinner.  Disliking network TV, we wait each season for the Big Bang to end so we can get them on DVD.  This is comfort TV for our generation.  A bit ribald at times, it is so fun to watch them and their whacky geeky troubles unfold.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|after all the hype it was a bit disappointing; felt like there was too much reliance on battle scenes with orcs (boring) and the action scenes felt hurried; like a hollywood car chase: lets see how long we can make it last--even if gets ridiculous.<br />i guess after the lord of the rings it was hard for jackson to come up with an encore; it did seem at times he was just going through the motions with this one.<br /> i'm not sure about the attempts at comedy. i like martin freeman, and he was pretty good as bilbo, but perhaps the light-hearted timbre of parts of the movie made the dark parts less dark, thus reducing the tension, leaving one with a bit of an 'oh well' feeling at the end. for instance, the scene with the trolls is great on its own, but i feel it makes the subsequent scene with the pale orc a bit less threatening. good and evil is evened out a bit. the film has a light and breezy feel like harry potter. contrast this with the innocence of frodo vs the undiminished and seemingly overwhelming evil present in LOTR!<br /><br />i guess when you know a film is going to make billions of dollars, it saps the creativity a bit, even if you are a kiwi. on the other hand, disappointing as it was, it still deserves 3 stars, or maybe 2.5
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I found Angry Birds Seasons to be a very enjoyable game to play.  I think anyone who likes Angry Birds would like this.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Fascinating journey into what made Steve Jobs tick.  Not sure if I liked him or not but definitely respect what he accomplished.
0380789019|5.0|I like this book because the dialog is amazing it really ignites your curiosity about concepts you may or may not have been interested in before.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I have watched this movie since it has come, and catch it when it is on TV. This is a very good rainy day movie..
0783225733|5.0|I was a young lad when this unfolded.  I don't really remember much of this even making TV news.  Perhaps it did, but I don't remember as I would have been only eight years old.  Tom Hanks and the rest of the ensemble cast did a fantastic job of creating the mood and uplifting spirit.  A fantastic movie to make you feel good.
B0040NOWY8|5.0|Works very well and reliable.  Use it with any Blu-ray burners with this media no problems.  Great price for 20 spindles.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|my friend had this game but it wasn't for kindle now it is and its amazing good way to waste time
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait two read part two.  Now that I've read part one I'll watch the movie. This was a good read, hope the movie holds true to the book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Absolutely had a blast but needs more chapters. A little more direction at some points as well. But totally worth the time and money.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|My grandkids love this show.  It was so nice to be able to go online and order the movie.  So convenient.
B00003CXIP|5.0|I tell myself to watch this movie every couple of months.  It is one of those movies where each time you can find something new or different.  A great soulful story, that reminds me of my youth.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|I really enjoyed the music. Only complaint I have is the plastic CD holder was broke when I received it. I'll live with that.
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|I'm not sure why they pulled this one off the shelf now, since they just released a live album showcasing their latest material last year, but I'm glad they did.  This is a fantastic remaster with all of the instruments distinct in the mix.  I'm still training my ear, but I can make out each guitar more often than not.  The song selection is phenomenal, showcasing classic cuts from &#34;The Number of the Beast&#34;, &#34;Somewhere in Time&#34;, and &#34;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&#34; and performed at full throttle.  A worthwhile purchase if you want to hear a live band at the top of their game.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I love this !! I think it is his best one yet!  Love the songs!  I highly recommend it for anyone that likes Michael Buble'!
B0093X805W|5.0|We liked this book because it was well written and about candy. I liked all the funny characters and their silly mistakes.
B004P12SSW|5.0|Truly a classic feel good movie.  Good music and very clever dance routines.  Some of the characters are a bit shallow but most of it is great.
B00BEIVXKI|5.0|You can get rid of your old cd now, the new version of this under appreciated album is so much better.<br />Great sound, like all the new upgraded Morrissey albums. The track list and sequence of songs have a much better flow.<br />Packaging is a little on the cheap side but this seems to be the norm nowadays.<br />Highly recommend this to any Smiths or Morrissey fans.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|this story is similar to others but takes a different route.  the female character is so easy to identify with due to the writing of Keira Cass.  You definitely fall into the story and do not want to leave!!
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|Iron Maiden released an often-requested recording from the archives.  This shows the band at the top of their game on the Seventh Son tour back in 1988.  Recorded over two nights at N.E.C. and stitched together with the best footage and audio from each night, it's a great way to relive Iron Maiden at what most call their peak.  For those that bought it on VHS back in the day, this DVD repackaging is cleaned up, remastered, and has a 3-song encore not present on the original release.  The second disc has 2 documentaries about the band and 5 music videos.  A great deal for any heavy metal fan.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Wicked game fun for everyone!!!! ZOMBIES ZOMBIES ZOMBIES sorceress needs to be free though!!!!! And needs way more than n just 50 levels
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a very good sequal to the hunger games, although at times very confusing, sad, and mixed emotions filled through me.
B000SW4DH6|5.0|The music is great and very cleverly done.  Always a please to watch this one, no matter how many times I've seen it before.
B007TKT2SK|1.0|If an app is of interest to me and it offers a \\"Test Drive\\", I will give it a try. Unfortunately, the \\"test drive\\" for this app does not work.  The app's icon is on the \\"phone's screen\\", when I double click on it, nothing happens.<br /><br />I have an old physical calculator that works with feet and inches and it makes adding fractional dimensions easier. Does anyone know and/or can tell me if this calculator works with fractions with 12 as the base (as in 12 inches = 1 foot)?<br /><br />Please fix the \\"Test Drive\\" and I might change my rating.
B009K916ZK|4.0|My monitor is 13 years old.  It has serviced 3 computers now.  Both macs and PC's.  No complaints yet after 2+ months.
B00B671W6W|4.0|Anthrax pays tribute to the bands that have influenced them in this EP of covers.  Standouts include the entire band nailing it on Rush's &#34;Anthem&#34; and Thin Lizzy's &#34;Jailbreak&#34;.  You can tell that they love these songs and want us to appreciate them too.  If you enjoyed the originals or enjoy Anthrax, this is definitely worth a listen.
