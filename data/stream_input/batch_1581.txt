1582701709|5.0|I was very pleased when I received the book.  It was delivered in a very short amount of time.  The condition of the book was excellent.  It looks brand new and I bought it for a really low price.  I am 100% satisfied with my order, quality, and service!
0385474547|4.0|I have to admit this was a pretty hard read for a child my age. I am currently a 14 year old boy who had toread this book as a summer reading project for my ap class and I thought it would be pretty bad. It was actually pretty good after you get through the begging of the book you'll find it is much easier to read and everything's falls into place at the right time. The ending of the book was a little sketchy I think he ended it the way it was made for time issues but other than that good read :)
B0031RS7MW|4.0|Reading this novel feels almost as indulgent as the chocolates which tempt the reader on every page. The story begins on Shrove Tuesday, when Vianne Rocher enters a tiny village, her six year old daughter Anouk in tow. Vianne has spent her life constantly on the move, her mother dragging her from country to country and now she wishes to put down some roots and create a different way of life for her own daughter. \\"If ever a place were in need of a little magic...\\" she thinks and opens a chocolate shop in the little square, directly opposite the Church. The local priest, Francis Reynaud, is self righteous, opinionated and resentful of the shop he sees as frivolous and sinful. It represents everything he dislikes and he immediately begins to plot Vianne's downfall.<br /><br />This then is the story of battle lines drawn between the vibrant, bright and unapologetic Vianne, who flaunts her ideas and brings change to the people she meets and the brooding Reynaud. There are other characters of course, and they are important to the plot and engaging in their way, but it is the relationship between Vianne and Reynaud which are the bones on which the flesh of the story appears. Everything Vianne does is seen as a challenge and an affront to the priest, who tries to stop the changes which are overtaking his domain. This is a magical book, an easy read, but with interesting themes and characters and a simply wonderful ending.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Fan-freaking tastic!! This is fantasy at its best! Absolutely riveting! I have been reading Sci Fi and Fantasy for over 25 years and I would have to say that this book in particular is most likely one of the best, if not THE best in the last one to two decades.  I honestly wasn't sure about Brandon as I was introduced to him via WOT series. But on his own, and after he has some time and experience under his belt? Hell Yeah!! He rocks!!<br /><br />I truly believe that he is one of the few writers to give RR Martin a run for his money. If he continues to write the way he does in \\"Way of Kings\\" I believe he could be considered a true master of fantasy. As Heinlein, Asimov and Peirs Anthony are to Sci-Fi, Sanderson is to Fantasy.<br />Rich, imaginative, thoughtful, prosaic and mind provoking.  After 900 pages I am still trying to put together the BIG picture. And that makes reading a good book awesome!<br />I read it three times and still found things that I missed the first couple times.<br />An absolute gem of a \\"Must Read\\" for any true Fantasy Fan!!<br />I look forward to many more from Mr Sanderson!<br />Hear Hear!!<br /><br />\\"To be a fantasy geek requires the obsessive focus of a miniaturist and the artistic intellect of a medieval scholar.\\"<br />Dawne
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|ive been waiting for this on the fire for so long! this is an awesome game glad I can finally play it on my kindle.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Wow! This set was intense. Very violent, but awfully damn funny at the same time!<br />As a fantasy fan, this is not one of your \\"it all turns out great,the heroes are suave, virtuous and shining\\"!  It makes you laff at the darkest times! Total gallows humor.<br />And I must say that out of all of these truly personally messed up characters; I LOVE Glotka the best! Heaven forbid and may I be forgiven, but I laughed so hard at his awful dark, almost sick humor, I found myself having to wipe tears from my eyes! You would think to be ashamed of laughing at some very horrible incidents in this book, but its either enjoy the dark humor or cry from it. As he is wont to say \\"Why? Why do I do this?\\"<br />And I for one would prefer to enjoy the laughs when the real world is already dark enough at times.<br />\\"I mean you have to be realistic about these things\\" (as Logen Ninefingers would say) !!! ROFL!!<br /><br />Enjoy and dont take it to seriously! The second one in the series has me laugher harder!!<br /><br />\\"To be a fantasy geek requires the obsessive focus of a miniaturist and the artistic intellect of a medieval scholar.\\"
B007SYWFRM|1.0|The app may be free but look out it's pay pay pay.  When you are playing the game you can innocently click to get a part etc to go further and you don't know your are charging it to your account.  That's because it never has the buy icon associated with it.  Not happy at all.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game is fun and makes you think. It gets me frustrated sometimes with its challenge but I still love it!
B00701L5XS|5.0|Fast and with a great view of the knots(love the 3d look). Would recommend this program to anyone and especially Boy Scout leaders and scouts.
B005S1Y7FU|5.0|This review is for the shm-sacd. This release is fantastic. The clarity on this shm-sacd is great and flows through all tracks equally. I highly recommend this remastered version.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|I don't know anything about the previous games, but this was a great game until  my kindle fire couldnt download the update to play online, which is the most frustrating thing possible on this piece of kindle garbage. Its like that cruel little joke when you hang a twinkie on a fat guys head from a plunger and make him run around because its just out of grasp, f*** this.
B003HC8I5M|5.0|GREAT MOTOWN HITS.LOVE HIS VERSIONS.PUT IT ON MY COMP, SO I COULD LISTEN ALL THE TIME. ENJOY<br />EGGMAN[[ASIN:B003HC8I5M Going Back]]
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Incredible game.  This is well worth the normal price of any game, but for some reason it's free?!  It's very fun, the graphics and sound are both excellent...what can I say?  I strongly recommend this game.  And I'm a real user, not the developer, lol.  So my review is genuine.  Enjoy!  :-)
B004W4N55C|4.0|I love this app; it does everything I need it t do.<br /><br />Stops on Nexus 7 when you begin typing to search for a tab. Developers: please fix this, as it would be an awesome app on a tablet!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Enjoyable. Good graphics peacefully music. really a work of art from beginning to end. Wish more developers would put this much thought into their games.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have been averaging about five games per sitting at least twice per day for nearly a week.  So far there have been no issues.  The game itself is a favorite and this app is a great version.
B0086700CM|5.0|I water a year for this app and now it has come out and no it rodent need Internet connection.  if only they would come out with scoops
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a great time killer. if you get this scrumpdidiliumpcious app, you wont be sorry. get this app. and rate
0062082353|5.0|I appreciated the author's candor in explaining his job, politics that affected him in the field, and his relationship with his wife.  This was a REALLY good book that made me appreciate even more our military and their families.
1846554071|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK.<br /><br />I have always had a very complex relationship with Murakami books. I will enjoy the first two thirds of a Murakami novel only to start to hate it by the time I get to the end (the only exception to this, till now, has been \\"After Dark\\", which I loved almost completely). The best thing about IQ84 is this didn't happen. I kept waiting for the book to stop being wonderful and IT NEVER DID. (I hope you consider this review to include Volume 3, too)<br /><br />Murakami has the rare skill of being able to construct a reality that I can picture in my mind's eye even now, 6 months after first reading the novel. And the story itself is fascinating: alarming and gripping and written so exquisitely. It disturbs and comforts in equal proportions; an accurate reflection of real life. I thought about it for days after finishing the book(s).<br /><br />A friend of mine's reaction was more succinct, but similar: she said \\"Read IQ84 right now. If you've already read it, read it again.\\" That's how good this book is - in a world where the number of books is so vast you can't possibly read all of them, here is one you must read again.<br /><br />To quote The White Stripes, I said it once before but it bears repeating... I LOVED THIS BOOK.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|While the story gets 2 thumbs up, the characters were a bit one dimensional and were not the strong point of the book. That being said, however, the premise alone was enough to get this book to 3 stars and another star for the writing! I truly enjoyed the story and stayed up WAY too late to finish the tale. I know that a book is good when I just don't want to put it down--even if I know I should be asleep and will pay for my lack of sleep in the morning... This was one of those books. OK, stop reading reviews and just buy it already!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|FINALLY HALFBRICK STUDIOS MAKES A VERSION FOR THE FIRE!!! EASILY THE BEST GAME FOR THE FIRE!!! BUT IT SHOULDNT TAKE ABOUT 5 MONTHS TO MAKE THE VERSION!
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|If the lyrics alone don't make you melt, I don't know what else would.<br />This is a masterpiece on it's own. The content/subjects he uses aren't commonly discussed and keeps you entertained from the beginning of the cd throughout john mayer's guitar solo to the ending melodies on End
B008602KQI|5.0|Twilight let me down when it came to the big screen. This movie did not. I loved the choice of actors and they stuck yo the book. Can't wait for the second one.
1932100660|5.0|This book is incredible!  It has changed my lifestyle dramatically! I lowered my blood pressure and blood sugar, and have stopped taking medicine for acid reflux.  Plus, I have more energy...and have lost 10 lbs. in a little over 3 weeks also!!  [[ASIN:1932100660 The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted And the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, And Long-term Health]]
B006W0QR1S|5.0|One of the best movies ever. The story carried the whole movie not the action even though there was plenty of that. There was a real story behind it and the actors were great. I will be watching this again on a rainy day.
B005FISBTO|4.0|I do consider myself liberally religious, even so, this season was almost as good as the rest. Dexter learning about religion both the good and the bad sides of it I felt was a nice touch. The only time this season angered me was when the Doomsday killer acted holier-than thou, which admittedly was throughout the whole season. I for one enjoyed the other storylines as well, it gave me a break from the excessive darkness of the season's main storyline. Now I really want to read the book series to find out how the creators strayed from them, but I still like the show either way. Bottom line: if you're deeply religious, this season may offend you, but if you got through the first five seasons without a problem, you still may be in for some surprises, hope you have a strong stomache, enjoy!
B0047WJ12K|1.0|I usually don't hate movies this bad. I truely hated this movie that tried to outsmart itself. This was so complex on with no need. It was time I will never get back. If you do like this movie then you are distracted by effects. Did I say it was terrible! Worst movie I have ever seen.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I can never stop playing. I'm not very in to action games, But I love this game. I HIGHLY sudgest buying it. After all, It's free. You have nothing to lose. Delete it if you hate it.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This app is cool as you can make your own combination of sounds that you like i.e. ocean waves with the flute or piano. There are many combos you can create. The only drawback is that the app stops once you exit it. You cannot have it playing in the background at the same time you are using FB, etc.
0142405787|5.0|my son really enjoyed this book.  it arrived quickly and he also read it quickly. good price for the book
0142407380|3.0|my son enjoyed the story, but the cover was wrinkled-we didn't expect a \\"very good\\" used book to have a wrinkled cover.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first, I liked it, then when he introduced his idea of a playroom, I was a little turned off, but if you can get past the sex parts, it turns out to be a good love story, and you find out why he is \\"fifty Shades\\" messed up. All in all it is a great story.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Cannot give this product enough stars. Clean easy to read. graphics and stats ....That is all I think most people want. We are not  trying to major in electronics..Luv Luv this app...sent a paid for app to it's heavenly rest on the Cloud. nite nite Bad AS....you have been wonderfully replaced
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this series of books. I am on the second book now. I have not been reading much over the last few years, but<br />when I heard about this book I had to buy. Can't wait to get home and pick it up again.And my husband loves me reading this book. He keeps asking me \\"are you going to read Mr Grey tonight?\\" or \\"What is Mr Grey up to tonight?\\"<br /><br />It is a must read and will definitely improve your relationship with your mate..
B004MC8CA2|5.0|so glad to have to have this app. such a blessing.  the plans for daily reading are great.  all the different Bibles versions is so helpful.  thank you. thank you.  use it every day

B004MC8CA2|5.0|if you are a christian and you love God's word you must have this app. Good to read and to listen.<br />SDG
030758836X|2.0|I rarely write a bad review.  why bother?  But this book, to me, was beyond belief.  Way beyond.  The beginning was slow.  Once I understood what was really happening, I skimmed the rest of the book.  I am certain some people will love this book, but not me.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this app but wont let me download every time I try it says an error occurred while trying to purchase jetpack joyride plz try again :(
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have really enjoyed and used this app. You can also customize it. Gives detail on how much time you have left depending on what activity you use.
B000002B49|5.0|I really think the subject line says it all; I love the sounds of \\"Deep Forest\\", and this is an outstanding album.  I wish there were more.
0307744434|5.0|Erin Morgenstern's debut novel carries so much light and gravitas in equal measure, it is like trying to hold more water in your palm than your hand can hold. The word magic is so overused in literature ( make no mistake, this book is literature, destined to become a classic) -- yet here, the word seems inadequate to reveal what is remarkable about the journey readers will embark upon beginning with the first phrase. Simply, it reminded me of how it felt to believe again.<br /><br />It was quite a departure for me to relax and allow a book written in present tense, for the most part, to carry me along breathless, but it has; and I was quite sad to reach the end of the ride.  The book also re-awakened a spirit of excitement in me that having read it, I can recall, again. It re-kindled a spark left over from many, many years ago, when I was just eighteen and there was magic all around. If you feel a tugging connection with your childhood joy and the spirit of discovery, don't hesitate to read this wonderful story.
B008D28HYS|5.0|wonderful graphics! fun game... and bugs get fixed fast! absolutely my favorite app ever! email the publisher if you have technical issues...they are very helpful.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Fantastic product for the price. Product was actually better than advertised and I am getting a lot of use out of this keyboard. Fast shipping and great response to my questions! Received mini USB so this works perfect with my Coby Tablet. Definitely will buy from this seller again. Extremely happy!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I played this during a recent plane trip across country and my husband, who is not into games, was looking over my shoulder to suggest moves. Very fun.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was mind blowing! Could not put the book down. Loved it! Wish there were more books to follow!
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|Classic in it's own time.The actors are great but it wouldn't have even mattered. The story is one of a kind.It gives you goose bumps.
B003MPHQRK|5.0|This Play Arys Kai figure is amazing. The detail is astounding and almost identical to the game model.  Vanille is my absolute favorite characters in the series. The model has both forms of were wand/stick/pole/thing, open and folded. Which I like.<br /><br />Lots of the smaller pieces are not simply painted on but actual plastic pieces. Her jewelry like ecklace and braclets are seperate pieces. The beadwork on her shirt was nicely done.<br /><br />My only real problem in durability. Vanille herself is not at all a problem. Her wand piece has two delecite pieces on the side. On my figure the piece is falling off, I am probably simply going to glue it back in place.<br /><br />Happy Gaming!
B002ZG97LK|1.0|Don't get me wrong I like many re-makes but this one bites!  They didn't capture \\"footloose\\"at all. Don't waste your time...see the real thing. What's next? Dirty dancing?
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Good movie, lot of character development, plenty of action and suspense, liked Neeson's character But ending a little disappointing. But still recommend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard all the hype about this book and was really reluctant to read it and boy and I glad I did. It was a very well wrote book hands down.[[ASIN:B007SGM084 Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle: Fifty Shades of Grey; Fifty Shades Darker; Fifty Shades Freed]]
B00821OW8K|2.0|I was hoping for something more like the new War of the Worlds or Skyline and less like the waiting room at the doctor's office.  It was as though they expected us to care about characters we haven't gotten to know and thought we would really like to learn about the logistics of being a survivor when aliens attack, rather than experiencing some intense action and seeing what happened.  As far as openings go, this one was poor.
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|I saw this movie and all I have to say is, wow... what a waste of time. The movie is just a string of awkward, quiet scenes that have no dialogue, no background, and nothing really interesting happening. You have no real information about any of the characters, so by the end of the movie, I really didn't care who lived or who died as long as the movie hurried up and ended. If you want a good action flick, search somewhere else. If you want a good movie period, search somewhere else.
B00821PEYG|2.0|This is the second episode and it is still as exciting as sitting in a doctor's office waiting to have a rash looked at.  There is an alien invasion going on and for some reason we are treated to the logistics of being a survivor some more and seeing people that are competing with the aliens for being the biggest pains in the rear.  Where is the excitement?  Where is the fear?  Who knew an alien invasion could be so boring?
0316056863|2.0|I guess this book is supposed to be funny but I only smiled once and although an older white male isn't the target audience, certainly there should be something funny in a book that is supposed to be humorous.<br /><br />The first problem with the book is that we don't know what to believe--Fey supposedly is writing about her life but the stories are told in such exaggerations with punchlines that it's difficult to know what's true. She doesn't appear to be worried about facts (Halle Berry wasn't a star in the 1980s when Fey claims to have loved watching her, just one of many out-of-timeline mentions made in the book). And she uses words that are supposedly humor to slam people close to her.<br /><br />Fey tries to play the feminist card but instead comes across as mean-spirited. Her chapter on her dad is sad, where she tries to make him look pushy and tough--yet she doesn't realize that many of his personality traits are things she actually picked up from him. I came away liking her dad and disliking her--she's a bit of a brat by being so ungrateful about her upbringing.<br /><br />The only interesting parts of the book deal with her time at Saturday Night Live, where she throws co-stars and Lorne Michaels under the bus. But it must all be a joke, so it's hard to tell if any of her stories are real.  Let's just say that the urinating habits of the show's writers will gross you out, and that she doesn't seem to have fit into the frat boy atmosphere at the show. But her section on Sarah Palin was surprisingly positive toward the former V.P. candidate.<br /><br />Again, who knows how much of this is supposed to be taken as being true? But this book certainly isn't a \\"memoir\\" and instead is more of a distorted fantasy version of a person's life who appears to want to avoid facing herself by escaping into comedy. It's not worth reading and certainly does not match the hype or the positive reviews.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|i enjoy this app alot- the sounds are really comforting and help me fall asleep. i love how there is a timer that u can put ure custom time into. i love how u can save your favorote mixes of sounds. what i do not love, however: that it does not continue playing when u exit the app. i would like it to do so because sometimes i just want to play a game while listening to this  relaxing music. i dont know if that is a glitch or perposefull, but i would like that fixed.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is excelent. But it's not for everyone: it's specially good for people that that like videogames. And it's a must-read if one likes videogames and the 80's.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|iTunes has had Resurrected available for almost 2 weeks prior to the official date and I had downloaded it about a week and a half ago.  After listening to it several times, I was impressed that Bob Ezrin really brought out the greatness in Destroyer along with some nuances which make it a real joy to hear.  The original Destroyer is a classic but sonically at times seemed distant and lacking even with the 1997 remaster.  What we have now is a very full, upfront sound.  Peter's drums sound more direct and not echo drenched. Gene's bass is booming and Paul and Ace sound even better as well.  Even Bob Ezrin's orchestrations shine through now because I never felt they did on the original.  I enjoyed Ace's original Sweet Pain solo and the nice acoustic guitar arpeggios on Beth which almost links the ballad as a distant cousin to another one of Bob Ezrin's productions of 1976 which is Alice Cooper's I Never Cry.  But Detroit Rock City, Flaming Youth, Do You Love Me and Shout It Out Loud also sound fuller than ever!<br /><br />I also bought a physical copy because I wanted to see the packaging.  The packaging is great, but I wish it was a digipak as opposed to a jewel case. I also like that the Casablanca logo is printed on the disc.  It is also great that the original artwork has also been restored as well as a Bob's excellent memories of the album.  I still wish it came out as a deluxe edition featuring demos and unreleased tracks, namely Ain't None of Your Business.  Maybe that stuff one day will see the light of day. Judging by the reviews I have seen, I will go against the grain and say that I really enjoyed Resurrected and I am so relieved it never sounds like a \\"remix\\" which many of their contemporaries (Deep Purple, Thin Lizzy and Queen) have released over the years.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love these book super cool. She's a  good writer knows how to keep you wanting for more. The more you read it the more you want to know it how it will end. it's lots of fun to read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. the pets are so cute. I would love to have this game for each movie they have out.
B007ARJF6G|5.0|MDNA is an album that wins with every listen. This version does not contain one of his best songs (included in the deluxe version and the explicit simple) \\"Gang Bang\\", it's still a must for fans of GOOD Pop music.<br />At this very low price as it is impossible not to buy it!!.-
B008E374PO|4.0|Owl City's newest album \\"The Midsummer Station\\" Takes a whole new direction from the usual synth and acoustic sounds fans are used to hearing with majority of the music pleasing the younger audience with catchy pop songs never implemented in his earlier work such as \\"Maybe I'm Dreaming\\", \\"Ocean Eyes\\", and \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\". Although majority of his new songs in this albums are heavily influenced/mixed by Robert Orton, it doesn't mean that we have lost the old Owl City we've come to know and love. Songs like \\"Silhouette\\" a simple piano melody accompanied by his lyrical creativity where he captures the longing and pain of being all alone, Adam young himself reminds us that he still appeals to the fans that followed him as early as his \\"Of June Album\\" He himself has stated that he never wants to create another \\"Ocean Eyes\\" and as a result we get new beats and melodies that never leave his positive look on life. \\"Dementia\\", \\"Shooting Star\\", \\"Embers\\", \\"Good Time\\", etc. Listening to this album numerous times will give off the sense that these pop songs literally blend in with the summer atmosphere. For those who still follow Owl City, this album caters to the audience that loves him for his synth sounds and colorful vocabulary not many other artist implement. The younger/new coming Owl city fans are introduced to the new Owl City that captures the fun times of summer through lyrical imagery as only he can.
B001IF266C|5.0|This edition of \\"Seventh Tree\\" is excellent. Beautiful presentation. Excellent price. incredible album. A must for fans of Goldfrapp. Includes the singles \\"Caravan Girl\\" and \\"A & E\\".
B0073LWEXK|3.0|this game was fun, and very addictive. there were a few times I got turned around, but it honestly took me about three hours to finish. I am good at these kind of games, and I think most people would really like the challenge it presented, but I wish there was a game like this that lasted longer for people like me.
B004L03B3S|5.0|If two brothers were gay, what deeper love could exist between two men than the love between two brothers? This is a beautiful depiction of an otherwise taboo subject, a natural progression from brotherly intimacy as children to a sexual-romantic one as adults in the context of a baggage-free environment where the instrumental figure in the shaping of the brothers' feelings for each other seems to be their mother. The crux of the story-line, for me, is when the elder boy's Argentinian father shows up and relates how he feels the boys are too physically intimate and asks his ex-wife to intervene. In response, she simply replies : \\"We mustn't tell them that what they're feeling towards each other is wrong\\". If loving someone is wrong, what else on this earth could be right? I would certainly recommend this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Although this book was such a \\"written by a woman for women\\", it was a nice fantasy escape. Since we live in reality this is highly unlikely to ever occur, but a girl can dream...overall it was a very good read.
B004XUMN1M|2.0|Problem with this episode, is that the bad guy didn't die..  Seriously,  he should have been so dead.  I am retired military, and he would have been dead, dead, dead....  Writer's f/u'd  on this one...  Makes it a loser..... One has to assume he was destined to return as a nemisis in future episodes I suppose.
B005G6QF8Y|5.0|I'm not even sure how I ended up coming upon Natalia, but it was a blessing. I could swear Ms. Kills entered my brain did a brain scan, took some of my favorite parts of music, and put it into this CD. I. like. every. single. song.<br /><br />You should definitely buy the Deluxe edition, which has my favorite song is KILL MY BOYFRIEND. She has Lily Allen sassy, sarcastic lyrics, with Britney Spears' music collaboration ability. I'm sure she could also be compared to Lady Gaga and Rihanna in similar respects. Her lyrics are more along the lines Rihanna's and her music does have the piano combo DJed sound of Lady Gaga. However, I'd like to think she is a different beast all together. Natalia has an incredible talent for writing lyrics that coincide with the beats behind her or making her music fit just right with her lyrics. Although her voice isn't spectacular, she has a spot on talent for matching the attitude in the lyrics with the feel of the music.  The way she set up the album is really cool, too. She starts off with the sunrise opening of WONDERLAND followed by a one two punch of sarcastic sass with FREE and KILL MY BOYFRIEND. The middle album gives you raw energy with dark twisted fantasy sewn right in. By the time you hit broke you calm down and turn more confessional. Songs consists of slower, more melodic beats with subtle changes. Perfectionist makes you feel like you are in a trance while someone's general life story plays in the background.<br /><br />I'm seriously surprised that she isn't bigger in the United States. I think she could have a wide fan-base. I doubt she'd get plugs on the radio though since she is kinda risque. Keep making music Natalia! You have blown past showing potential and showed me that your next album could blow up and make me happy i discovered you long ago.
B004XUMP56|5.0|The redhead vixen is back, and she is great!!! This is a great episode,  it's a great series.  Gotta wonder who the \\"dipstick\\", being nice here, was that canned the series.  Whoever it was is probably in a mental ward, being pumped full of drugs....

B0001MLMKY|4.0|I've had 2-3 Swatches over the years, and was looking for a replacement for sports/sauna/etc activity.  The Once Again is a typical \\"clean\\" Swatch design, but I find the day/date to be very distracting when glancing at the watch-it seems that the minute hand is stuck at approximately :15 every time I look at it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Simple design<br />Comfortable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Day/Date makes it look like minute hand is stuck at :15<br />Face is a bit small for a typical man's wrist<br />Band could be bigger<br />Band can't be replaced (from what I can see)
0345803485|3.0|[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]] I have to agree with the other reviews on this book, which I wish I had of read BEFORE I \\"purchased\\" the book. It is drags on for the first 9 chapters, then heats up for the rest of the book. The second book is pretty much same as the first once it gets a few chapters in as well... That's the sad part of it all, it doesn't really waver past the plot of the first book. Haven't read the third, but I am hoping it moves in a different direction... Yes, I bought all 3 books and if I had not wasted money on the first, I wouldn't have bought any. I am letting others borrow the books and saving them the money.... This does sound more like a teenager type of writing rather than an adult and the 30 something millionaire she is in love/lust with...... He thinks he all that and a god's gift to women and men both, the WORLD even! book (the first book anyway)....<br />I am sorry to the author to write such a bad review, but good luck to her on future attempts to possible write something better and congrats to her for making as much money as she has on this/these books.<br />Oh, and if you decide to get the other book from her about sex tips, don't bother on that one either. I wanted to \\"learn\\" how to talk dirty to my husband in bed, and all it did was suggest things NOT to do, well I already KNEW those!!! It doesn't tell you anything on \\"how\\" to talk dirty in bed and the rest of the book seems more like her opinion and not a \\"how to!\\"

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Anthony Ryan is the new master of fantasy, and Raven's Shadow is his masterpiece. If you want to be captivated by words, compelled by plot, and engaged by pacing, along a landscape of epic proportions while still maintaining intimate contact with characters who are the very breath of legends, then this is the book you seek. Blood Song is like being reunited with an old friend. The days of glory have come again. Not since the Musketeers have we seen such daring. Not since Camelot have we seen such depth and devotion. Raise the banners high. Go forth. The Raven's Shadow wins the day.
B000RIY27M|1.0|The basic premise of the episode was great, as was the explanation for the emergency situation, but the non-linear structure and constant repetition were annoying.  And wow, I did not see that ending coming.  Normally that would be a good thing, but the ending to this episode made me lose all interest in this show...until I found out that the writers did make things right in later episodes.

B00000DR8R|5.0|I played this album to death, it literally died in my tape deck and my many flatmates all know the words to each song as well! couldn't believe i could get it on cd, great album from a very talented and unabashed lyricist who had some weird relationships to base his songs on - makes you feel quite normal. great band to back him up - a match made in heaven! i would definately recommend buying this.
B006VA3ZEG|4.0|This UK version of the series is better because it seems to use slightly different cuts of some parts and some of the terminology used seems to be different. All of this adds up and, seeing this version is better and the storyline makes more sense than the version they seem to have cut for the US PBS version.<br />It isn't all that much different but, these subtleties seem to make a difference and makes one wonder why either PBS or more likely, the UK producers thought they needed to make a \\"US\\" version at all!

B008FTAAG2|4.0|Personally I think it's musically way over produced, sounds like they'll need to add a keyboardist to the band.  On the other hand, I think Maria is hitting her stride vocally.  I preferred the first two albums more.

I appreciate what you all do there at AMAZON.  Your service and attention to all matters and all details is above reproach.<br /><br />Thank you again, for handling my favorite app.<br />Best regards,<br /><br />Terry Damiani
B000B5XOYI|5.0|These movies are fantastic!  They give me good memories of my childhood.<br />to those who are bashing the last two movies : give me a break!!!  Of course its cheesy!  Robin is included!  Those movies are aimed more towards children. As opposed to \\"the dark knight\\" movies were obviously targeting an older audience. Lol.
0385344228|5.0|I won't repeat the synopsis of the other reviewers but I highly recommend this literate thriller.  Indeed, it is a page turner but it grapples with issues far beyond the usual \\"who done it\\" genre - i.e.  How well can a parent ever know his/ her own child?  How objective can a parent be?  At what point does a parent decide to do what is right, rather than what is right for her family?  Those seeking a neat and tidy ending will be disappointed, but the reader who revels in ambiguity and gray area will be enthralled.

B008VKNEJU|5.0|Been waiting to get this album ever since i heard the pre-release stream of it!<br /><br />Led with her beautiful soulful vocals, this debut album from Jessie Ware wonderfully combines elements of pop, R&B, soul, and electronic music.<br />I already knew I loved her sound the very instant i heard the title track, a very calming ambient feel with a solid beat and muted guitar riffs.<br />My favorites are \\"Devotion\\", \\"Running\\", \\"Swan Song\\" although every song is worth listening to, definitely worth the buy for me.

0882847953|4.0|A treasure trove of rythmic nuggets.  I use it extensively to make my feet quicker, more nimble.<br />Also the help that left hand and left foot strengthen.<br /><br />I like the accent patterns as well.  They have been useful for my 32nd note work.<br /><br />There are a variety of rythmic ideas suited for different things.  For instance, some of the patterns focus on duple and tuples, which is very useful for doing very fast foot work.  Others contain longer runs, which are usefull for strengthening the feet at lower tempos.<br /><br />Love the hand written notes; things used to be sooo simple in the world.
B007SGM084|5.0|Granted the writing style is a bit off, but I'm no expert. The plot and idea behind it is fantastic and if I ever get the chance to meet Mr. Grey, Anastasia better watch her back ;) lol
B0068MNO4S|5.0|I watched this movie without a clue as to its premise. I can only speak to the entertainment value of this film and not to its historical accuracy.  Many of the reviewers of this film and some of my friends critique the film because of the historical flaws or inaccuracies in its presentation. Having no knowledge of the critique of Shakesperien authorship, I cannot comment or address that issue.<br /><br />Anonymous is an entertaining and thought provoking film which posits that the Earl of Oxford was the actual author of the Shakespearien corpus. The plot deals with the court intrigues and amorous adventures of Queen Elisabeth I of England and her commoner advisers, the Cecils. The Cecils oppose theater as an unwholesome and subversive activity forcing the Earl to conceal his identity as the author.  Oxford uses his plays as a political commentary which eventually lead to unexpected consequences.  Whether Anonymous is fact or fiction matters not.  It is a thoughtful engaging film regardless of its historical authenticity.<br /><br />I never heard of Rhys Ifans or Edward Hogg before I saw this movie, but they gave outstanding performances.  The other actors were also strong.  The only character that did not seem to fit in the film was Shakespeare himself which I am sure was intentional to make believable his inability to pen such great literature.<br /><br />With no preconceived ideas, with no search to find answers, viewing this movie was a great experience.  I actually think it is the best movie I have seen so far this year 2012. If you are looking for a well acted, intriguing historical drama this is a good choice.<br /><br />Some cautions:  Some people say it is slow moving and/or hard to follow.  Yes it can be, and I did have to watch it twice to fully appreciate it. It does take above average attentiveness to stay in the flow of the storyline but it was well worth it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|okay was sort of ok with peeta saying', oh the one girl who I love, the one girl I followed around my whole life, came with me to the hunger games.'two things though. ONE- gale should have gotten katness.and TWO-peeta dosent desrve to live. he should have been the one die.<br /><br />  But, to get to the ponit, why did rue have to die? she was so young and really fast at climbing trees( like me ) and she didnt deserve to die( like peeta).there is something I addmirer about Rue. I dont know if its the way she smiles, or how she helped katness, or even the way Thresh (the hotty) is always looking out for her. I dont know what it is , but I admire her and wish she would stay in the rest of the siries.<br /><br />  P.s-<br />  still the best book siries ever!!!!!!!
B0044XV3QY|3.0|This is for the extended Bluray 3-discs.<br /><br />Loved the original movie so waited until this extended version gets cheap enough to purchase, paid $22 but I really feel it only worth $15.<br /><br />The extra materials are not that compelling. The deleted scenes are mostly un-finished. Motion capture is not new technology. In comparison, the ABYSS special edition had better extras, and this Extended release is not nearly as compelling as the Extended ENCOUNTER OF THE THIRD KIND inside spaceship (must see).<br /><br />Pay usd$15, no more.

B006ZZAN60|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best live performance from Loreena McKennitt. I have the discontinued DVD/CD 3 disc set. The show includes a facinating array of obscure instruments and the musicians who keep them alive. This set covers songs including up to An Ancient Muse. This performance is wonderful, not a sour note in the entire show. One thing that is interesting, both Marco Polo and The Old Ways sound much better here than on the original CD studio releases. If you already own a stack of her releases, as I do, this is still a worthwhile addition.
B005C7SXMS|2.0|It is a pretty bold statement for a Welshman to open up his movie for thanking America for not invading his country.  And to open Submarine up further to us Yankees, the DVD cover even features the phrase \\"Ben Stiller Presents\\" on it.  But before Stiller (who makes a cameo in the movie) fans watch the film, please note that Submarine does not resemble any of Stiller's farces like Zoolander.  Submarine is much more subtle in its humor (to the point it is questionable that it is even a comedy) and much more dry it is wit than most Americans are used to.<br /><br />Submarine is a coming of age story about a boy in Wales who embarks on his first schoolboy romance around the same time he fears his parents' marriage is falling apart.  The movie was written and directed by Richard Ayoade who may be best know (only known to the American public) for the recently movie The Watch which co-starred Stiller.  If you are a fan of broad comedies like The Watch, Submarine is not for you because only people who enjoy the slow British comedies (which I tend not to)  will probably enjoy this movie.  And do not expect much from the extras which only features a Making Of special and a couple deleted scenes.
B000002G26|3.0|I just went through the itinerary on Amazon and I see that Bryan Adams hasn't done anything since at least 1993 and alot of it is rehashed compilations and it gets tiring hearing the old stuff after awhile even after the dates read on the Amazon pages say that the things were released as late as 2008 which was 4 years ago. This is why I give it only 3 stars.
0156027321|5.0|I've heard mention of The Life of Pi for years but never knew much about it.  All I'd heard was that it was the story of a boy on a lifeboat with a tiger.  And that it was a very good book.  Recently I'd also heard that they were making it into a movie.  So now, after waiting far too long, I finally dove in.<br /><br />One of the first things that struck me was just how elegant and lovely the writing is.  There are segments of writing that are absolutely poetic in their description and tone.  The way the narrator describes the way he feels about life, religion and the world around him is very vivid and evocative.  There are some wonderfully beautiful passages in this book.<br /><br />Another thing that struck me immediately was the way the book was crafted.  The book (at least my edition, and presumably all editions) starts out with an introduction by the author in which he explains that this is based on a true story taken from an interview with the actual character.  When the author is first introduced to the story he is told that it is a story that will make a person believe in God.  Even without this claim, as you read this book you are likely to sense some desire to explain God and Nature and the relationships in the Universe.  But having this claim at the outset of the novel produces an overarching shadow hanging over the plot and compelling the reader to think about the passages on a different level than they otherwise might.<br /><br />As we get into the story itself, most of the chapters are written in first person as presented by Pi (short for \\"Piscine\\") Patel.  Interspersed throughout these main plot-driving chapters are shorter chapters in the author's voice commenting on his interview with Pi or with something that happened while he was researching the story.  These insistences on realism help ground the story but also provide moments for the author to interject subtle (or sometimes not-so-subtle) commentary about a scene or an item of importance.<br /><br />The book is divided into three Parts.<br /><br />The First Part introduces us to Piscine \\"Pi\\" Patel and his family and life in India.  They live in a small town in India running a zoo.  Pi reminisces about his childhood; about the teasing and bullying that lead to his nickname; about life in the zoo; about the lessons on life that his father teaches him; and about Pi's journey into multiple religions.<br /><br />Pi is born Hindu but in his early teens he discovers Christianity and Islam and dives headlong into all three religions.  There are a few great pieces of narratives describing the struggle and balance of maintaining three religions.  There is also a semi-heated scene when leaders from all three churches confront Pi and his family on the street and demand that he follow only a single religion.  Pi's response is that he just wants to love God and he feels like each religion has its own unique benefits and methods to help him love God.  He presents interesting arguments about the infighting among different religions when the bottom line is that we need to love one another and love God.  It's an intriguing and well presented discussion.<br /><br />Finally we prepare to transition to the Second Part of the book.  Political turmoil is underway in India so the family decides it's time to move along.  They make preparations to sell off the zoo animals and then board a ship for Canada.  They are on the same cargo ship as a number of the animals they have sold and so on the journey Pi continues to interact with the animals.<br /><br />The journey doesn't go as planned.  Somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic there is a storm and some other unexplained problems and the ship sinks.  Pi is thrown onto a lifeboat.  At first he thinks he is alone but he soon finds that there are other escapees from the ship.  A handful of animals, including a Bengal Tiger.<br /><br />The next many chapters outline Pi's journey and adventures traveling across the Atlantic ocean.  There are great segments of narrative as Pi ponders on the sublime nature of being alone in the middle of the ocean staring out across nothing but water and sky.  There are moments of tension and adventure as Pi tries to deal with the fact that he has a 450 pound meat eating beast sharing the same small craft.  There are moments of disgust and desperation as Pi has to work with what little he has in order to survive.<br /><br />In the end, Pi does survive.  The overall tension of his survival is removed thanks to the note at the beginning pointing out that this is a true story composed largely through an interview with Pi.  Removing the tension of inevitable death doesn't make the story any less dramatic.  If anything it allows you to focus more on the storytelling.  On the how and why he survives.  On the journey and what happened there.<br /><br />Part Three of the book concludes the story of Pi's adventure by outlining what happened to him once he finally reaches land and humanity.  Even more interesting is his interview with representatives from the company in charge of the ship that sank.  They are trying to determine the cause of the shipwreck and understand Pi's journey.  First he tells them the same story we have just read.  They find the story too fantastic and unbelievable.  So he then tells them an alternate version of what might have happened.  In the end, it's left unclear which is the true story.  And even more thought provoking is the question of \\"Which story do you like better?\\"  Or which story would you rather believe?<br /><br />Through the first part of the book I was really enjoying the fairly straightforward descriptions of life and religion.  I found them very interesting and enjoyable.  Once we arrived on the water, it seemed like we were in a different type of story.  An adventure story.  But as I continued to read, I realized it was still the same sort of story and same sort of thoughts and discussions, just taken to a different level.  When I finally reached the end and the strange interview in Part Three, I had to think back and reinvestigate all of Part Two again under a new mindset.  It put the overarching theme into yet another new light.<br /><br />While this is an enjoyable and interesting book at the high level, this book is a deep and multi-layered work of art that unravels thread after thread and lays them beside each other for you to study and ponder.  The book calls upon the reader to evaluate your view on life, nature, religion, humanity and relationships.  It presents a few ideas but in the end it challenges the reader to make up his or her own mind about these things and to act and life accordingly.<br /><br />Some scenes may be a bit graphic for young readers but otherwise I think this is a book that anyone can enjoy at some level and most will find entrancing and thought provoking on many levels.<br /><br />*****<br />5 out of 5 stars
B003EV6DBM|4.0|A good program that I really enjoyed.  I'm only giving the DVD set four stars because the packaging is acceptable, but a little on the cheap side.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Book Three of the Fifty Shades of Greed was a fast read.  This was not because it was a page turner but because I continually sought connections made by the author as the 'incidents' of sexual (abuse) encounters evolved.  I am older than most readers of this trilogy and decided to cut to the chase by reading the last one to find out what all of the commotion was about.  I then asked many of my 40-50 age group friends (they are most analytical, very articulate, and avid readers) if they read the book and what they thought of it.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, had the same reaction about the sexual exploits of this couple...one of absolute impossibility and STUPIDITY!  One of my dearest 40-50 age friends had been raped twenty years ago and said that the book was pure S&M; it made her sick.<br /><br />I felt that it was a book  (somewhat) about loyalty, loneliness, and relationships.  Being a professional, with friends in the professional genre, my opinions about this book maybe rather skewed.  This is for no other reason except that I had come out of 'the dirty book' closet to admit to and ask about the book.  Really?  I was relieved and reassured with their candid and shallow review of the book.<br /><br />I have nothing else to say.  The findings of my straw poll:  the book was boring and STUPID!

B002AWX6UM|5.0|This is one of Amazons prizes!  What a heartbreaking story, war is terrible at any age, and to find yourself in the middle of it at the age of twelve is unimaginable.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I don't like to write bad reviews, but... honestly, I hoped more of it, and lamentably the book left much to be desired. The erotica in it is childish, laughable at times. I do not know about the sequel, but I have no intention of reading the other two books. I can't fathom the idea this is going to become a film!

0375507256|1.0|I gave this book, \\"The Cloud Atlas: A Novel,\\" one star because apparently there's no scope here for zero star ratings.<br />  I found \\"The Cloud Atlas\\" to be the most pretentious (as well as tedious) book I've read in years.  Admittedly, though, I'm in a tiny minority with that opinion.  Apparently (and inexplicably), there are hordes of readers who enjoy banal social commentary<br />as written by postmodern \\"visionaries\\" like Mr. Mitchell.<br />  Mr. Mitchell deserves points for one thing, though.  He is clearly THE Great Master at crafting irritating-to-read, post-apocalyptic dialects.<br />  Anyway, to sum things up, I wish I had beaten myself about the head and neck with this book instead of trying to read it.  I would have enjoyed that more, by far.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I've played the hell out of this game on my iPad. this is not the same game. the framerate is choppy and it really effects the gameplay. I hope this is fixed in the future.

B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|It might seem odd to review a bestseller after the hype has died down, but such was the influence of this book over me that I decided that I had to hold off reading it until my own thriller was published.  Of course, I couldn't stay away completely and succumbed to the Swedish film version but I waited until I had a good first draft of my own novel. Why? Because we both had spiky female protagonists and I didn't want to be unduly influenced by Lisbeth Salander's characterisation.<br /><br />Rather than simply recount the plot and add spoilers, I'd rather concentrate instead on the characterisation.  Did Girl live up to the hype? As far as the characterisation of Salander's is concerned - yes.  And it is to see what Lisbeth does in the sequels is the reason I shall be reading Hornets Nest and the Girl who Played with Fire. Blomkvist's characterisation doesn't quite match that of Salander's but perhaps that was intentional - that Larsson chose to put the female protagonist centre stage.<br /><br />The plot is sprawling and there's swathes of minor characters and the family tree is as complicated as the family in War and Peace, but if you like your thrillers with a social conscience, as I do, this deserves to outsell all the pale imitators that will no doubt, follow in its wake.
B0001CNRB6|5.0|I like old movies of this type.  They are wholesome and entertaining unlike the movies we get today.  My favorites are My Fair Lady and the version of High Noon with Gary Cooper.  We may never see this quality movie again.  Lover Come Back, while not a classic in my opinion, was very entertaining.  I would recommend it.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown by Eric Blehm is about the story of Adam Brown, a kid from Arkansas who was extremely proud of his state.  He wasn't the biggest kid, but he had the biggest heart who saved a boy with Down Syndrome from being bullied, obeyed his parents even if it got him picked on by his friends and was always doing crazy stunts.  He was always well-liked and respected.  Eventually, he got into drugs and ultimately landed in jail.  One day, he met the woman who would be his future wife and between her, his parents and God, he got clean with just a few relapses.  He decided that he wanted to go into the Navy.  But, in the usual Adam Brown fashion, he didn't want to just be on a ship; he wanted to be a SEAL.  With the determination he has shown his entire life, he persevered to achieve his goal.  On March 17, 2010, with a highly decorated career, he gave the ultimate sacrifice while trying to protect his team.<br /><br />While reading this book, I was struck by how much he and his team were like brothers.  You always hear that it is that way, but if you were never in the military (and I wasn't), you just don't know the extent until you start reading a book like this.  These guys went shoulder-to-shoulder into danger to protect our freedoms and you could just imagine the sense of brotherhood when these guys spoke of Adam with such respect, love and grief.  Even though I knew how it was going to end, I still cried reading about the grief of his family and his friends, his brothers.  Eric Blehm said it himself in the Afterword, \\"Even with the knowledge that Adam truly was ready-body and soul-to give up his life in the line of duty, the final chapters of this book were heartrending to write.  I knew what was coming, but I hoped for a different outcome...somehow.\\"  I knew how it was going to end and I kept hoping he would pull through and go home to that beautiful family of his.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, no matter how you feel about the War on Terror.  There are so many other men and women who died serving our country whose stories we don't get to hear.  They, and Adam Brown, deserve for us to take the time to read about the sacrifices they go through while we sit in our homes, playing with our children, griping about how we have to do this or that that, in the grand scheme of things, really aren't that bad.  And, through it all, he never lost his faith in God.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.  I did not receive compensation for a positive review.  All opinions are my own and may differ from yours.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|This is one of the classic Aflred Hitchcock movies with Cary Grant.  My wife has watched it several times over the years on VHS.  I wanted to get it for her on DVD.  We both enjoy watching this movie.  I stongly recommend it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game has some good games there are easy and hard. ones the only problem I had was all the ads wayyyy too many other than that it s really fun
B000GJPL1S|5.0|This is what I would consider to be a perfect movie. Every scene well done and all fit together in a complete, perfect way. Anyone who hasn't seen this absolutely should. Fantastic movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really love and enjoying playing. You can also make changes to background and cards, etc. Its easy and fun!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|My favourite book. It's just that simple. I doubt I can add much to what is already written about this one. I started calling my brother Ignatius and since he also liked the book so much he considers it a compliment. But then, he's odd.<br /><br />It's the sort of writing that makes you buy an author's new book without even glancing at the synopsis. But the world was robbed of a genius with John Kennedy Toole's early death.<br /><br />If you read just one book, make it this one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I discovered this app at a frozen yogurt place!. They had ipads and my brother taped on the app and I played like 20 levels and fell in love!<br />Warning! This app gets addictive! If you are going somewhere but you have 5minutes to spear,DON'T PLAY THEN!!!! You will not stop!!!
B004SEUIXS|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It's very different from most American films and it's a very awkward film to watch it with parents. Amazing movie overall and the condition of the DVD was in mint condition
B00785P2QC|4.0|its great so far I had downloaded this on my Mac the other week it was doing great then it started closing down like #10x. I'm hoping that it doesn't do it on here.
B000001GBJ|5.0|I am really enjoying the CD.It has all the songs I liked and more.It was good to be able to hear a preview before I ordered. The package took half the stated time to arrive which was great.Will definitely order my music through Amazon again. Ducks.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Her songs really grow on you. Why didn't I listen to them before. She needs to make more albums already!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am the type of person who has to finish a series of books no matter how awful the book may be. With some persuasion from my friends I finally read the fifty shades series and was extremely disappointed. If you look at the series as a whole and take out all the sex scenes you might only have enough material to fill one book. The lack of character development is appalling considering the author had three books develop them. The only person we really know about is Christian and even that is only linked to a few key moments in his past. This book was purely written to shock stay at home suburban housewives and if you are into reading soft core poorly written porn then this is the book for you.
0807014273|5.0|On the surface this little gem of a book could appear simplistic. However, the author, a Nazi camp survivor, does not dwell on his horrors or loss (both unimaginable to me). Rather the gift of life under any circumstances is truly a gift, how we choose to live our gift is totally up to each person.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|a really awesome app! lots of really useful info here. love the time till battery is ready and condition of the battery info.
0805095535|4.0|Once I started reading Paul Auster's memoir, Winter Journal, I couldn't stop. Many memoirs are formulaic chronological reflections on either the wonder or terror of the subject's life. Auster follows an unconventional structure using a narrator speaking to the subject, Auster. While odd at first, it became the perfect device for a highly skilled writer to convey wisdom and perspective about his life. Perhaps this book resonated for me because I am just a few years younger than Auster. I found his treatment of his body throughout his life, and the importance of place through each of the twenty one places where he's lived, to be important ways of conveying how we engage in the world. Any reader who appreciates first-rate writing, especially one who enjoys memoirs, is likely to enjoy this finely written memoir.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
B004SIP8BG|5.0|Hero is among the greatest movies ever made. From its dramatic use of colors and sound to its stunning choreography to its simple yet complex storytelling, I can't imagine anyone not liking this film. The story is of a Nameless man who meets with an Emperor to recount his tale of how he conquered the kingdom's three most deadly assassins. Not only is the Nameless man an unreliable narrator, but he holds the future of the land in his hands. If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out on a feast for your senses. The picture and sound on bluray is the only way to enjoy it.
B008GFI4KY|5.0|Is this album groundbreaking?  No<br />Is it shocking?  No<br />Is it an unexpected Darkness album?  No<br />Is it amazing?  YES<br /><br />This album will remind you what great rock music sounds like...at a time when terrible pop music rules the radio.
B00846REIS|3.0|For some reason, after reading Fifty Shades (which was poorly written), I got stuck in a mood for novels like this. Bared to You is most definitely better than Fifty Shades when it comes to writing.
B008VBYN80|5.0|kingdom and. lords is one of my favorite everybody. I think everyone mit want to get it. it is the most fun game ever made
B0088TG252|4.0|\\"Safe House\\" starts out with a bang- it has more action in the first 30 minutes than most movies have in their entirety. And it's well-filmed, gritty, grounded, realistic action. You will be sucked in and reluctant to blink, as you follow the events that unfold in the film's first third. Whoever directed this movie clearly studied a lot of Tony Scott pictures while he was in film school- his influence is stamped all over \\"Safe House\\", which is by no means a bad thing.<br /><br />Here we get a great glimpse of \\"Bad Denzel\\", the one who shows up in the likes of \\"Training Day\\" and \\"Book of Eli\\". He is incredibly confident, capable, and intimidating, without ever coming off as being unduly cocky or melodramatic. He is one of the great actors  working today, and his charisma is hard to ignore. Ryan Reynolds holds his own as he tackles the formidable task of trying to perform opposite Denzel. The young Reynolds does a great job here, and you don't even think of him as \\"Van Wilder\\" during the movie... not too much, anyway! And love the small role that Robert Patrick performs, as a grizzled, hard boiled combat vet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, things start to slow down about halfway through the movie (though there are still a couple of great action sequences sprinkled throughout), and then the story goes completely off the rails. If you've seen just about ANY unambitious government/spy/action movie over the past 25 years, you will see the \\"surprise\\" ending coming ten miles away. It's such a tired cliche, I don't even think you could call it a \\"surprise\\" by any means. I guess I was just \\"surprised\\" that a movie with such high production values wouldn't spend a little more time on the development of the plot. Bummer- but even the uninspired story cannot undo what is an otherwise great, gritty action flick. Anybody who is a fan of Denzel, action, or \\"Tony Scott\\" style movies will not be disappointed.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great game! it does not freeze up and the screen does not turn blue. the sky is never ending, though, and sometimes when you try and move things the game zaps you out in the middle of the huge, annoying, blue sky. when this happens, most people freak and try dragging the screen every wich way. that IS moving them, but they can't tell because the sky around them never changes and looks as though they are not moving. if this happens, I recommend turning the game off, counting to 60, and turning it back on. that ought to get your feet back on the ground! but beware! if you get this game on your kindle, you will not have goals! this is just a glitch that does not effect the dragons and level changes in any way. team lava is working on this.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps so far.  I like how the numbers are x out as they are used.  An excellent mind exercise!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun to play, great way to pass the time. The goal of unlocking the other games keeps me coming back for more!
B003O6QCPO|5.0|If you are a fan of the blues you will love this album!!! But don't take my word for it, play a preview and you will be hooked.  I have always enjoyed the blues and will listen to it on pandora or something like that, I have not purchased a ton of albums because I like to have a mix, and that is what this album gave me.<br /><br />I loved all the tracks!! And the differences in the singers, so this is a great sample for me.  My uncle who is a die hard blues fan loves it too, so I think this will appeal to all blues fans new or old :).<br /><br />I can not even pick a favorite track because they are all so unique, although Grindin Man with Pinetop Perkins is way up there, but then so is Born in Louisiana with Clarence Brown, and Prison Blues - really just can not pick 1 favorite :).<br /><br />Some people get into all the nuances of songs and such, I just know what I like, and I LOVE this album.
030758836X|4.0|This is not the brilliant masterpiece some of the reviewers are claiming, nor is it the failure some of the other readers claim either. It's confusing, isn't it? You know what they say about opinions and...that part of a person's anatomy. Anyhoo,yes, I will agree that it is slow in the beginning and yes, the ending does make you go...wtf. But this book is still an enjoyable reading experience in my humble opinion. I enjoyed it and had fun reading it and cared enough to keep reading. Maybe you will to. If not, you won't have to mortgage your house. I happen to like this writer and I think the way a book is written is as important as the story. If you agree with this you will enjoy the book.
0375842209|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book! It is written beautifully and takes you on an amazing emotional journey. It is one of my new favorite books!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|The game itself is pretty fun and possibly addicting. Entertaining the player with mission to complete, attempts to break the highest record, level ups, and things to buy with coins earned during gameplay, this game is fun and addicting. However, I am a Kindle Fire user and the game has some problems. Soon after I have purchased the game (free), I noticed that the screen slightly scrolls down once I have started playing.<br /><br />After a while of playing, something restricted the fun I was having by making the game more difficult. It was not very noticeable at first, but after a while of playing the game, I noticed that the game increased its speed. The character's legs were already sprinting at the beginning of the game. Using the jetpack, I saw that the character moved up and down faster than normal. These problems really damaged the fun of the game, but the game itself is fun.<br /><br />  This game was shown to me by a friend. I noticed the game on his Iphone and thought that it would be fun for me to play it too. The game was not available at the time, but I expected it to come soon. Once it was out, I downloaded it and started to play it. It is a great, addictive game overall.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Almost perfect. My problem with this ap is I have over 2000 songs but it only shows me 2k. Why Amazon?
B0086700CM|5.0|Enjoyed it more than I expected. I try to stop after a couple of rounds but cant. brest game for a good price.
0345803485|1.0|I was reading a really badly scripted version of Pretty Woman. The words were overlapping and repeated over and over, which had me believing the book had either been written by a person of very limited IQ and an even more limited vocabulary. I threw it in the trash.
145162607X|4.0|This is Ms. Gregory's next installment in her Cousin's War series after Lady of the Rivers. In this novel she takes on the time period after Edward IV is on the throne with his wife, Elizabeth Woodville (Lady Rivers). The Earl of Warwick (Richard Neville) is the man who put him on that throne and is therefore known to history as \\"The Kingmaker.\\" But it is the Queen's family that is seeing all the benefit from Edward's elevation; Edward had married her in secret, without the Earl's advice and now Neville is feeling quite put out. He plots to dethrone Edward and put his brother, George, Duke of Clarence on the throne. So Neville marries his daughter Isabel to George and finds himself at war with Edward.<br /><br />Need I say that there is no period in history more confusing than this?<br /><br />What follows is a fascinating look into the minds of the two daughters of Richard Neville - Isabel the older and Anne the younger. Anne would have a slightly heavier cast in history as she ended up as Queen whereas Isabel was only a duchess. Either way their father used them for his own ends until he was killed in battle and that is where Ms. Gregory sets the lives of the girls into their own hands with this novel. She takes what she could find in the historical record and spins a tale of two sisters growing up in fear of one woman -  Elizabeth, Queen consort of England. She was rumored to be a witch and as this tale goes forward both girls are deathly afraid of that rumor. Anything that goes wrong in their lives they attribute to the power of the queen.<br /><br />This leads to a really good read. If it had not been canning season I would have read it in one sitting but the vegetables took precedence. The back half was slightly better than the beginning as Richard of Gloucester played more of a role. Ms. Gregory did not have him as Shakespeare did and he is a fine romantic hero in this book - to a point. The historical details take to into the time period and keep you captivated in the tale. My only complaint is that the book is written from Anne's point of view and it starts when she is about 8 years old and the voice remains young throughout. She does not seem to age until the very end when her son dies. I don't think I'm giving any spoilers here, history is history.<br /><br />Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the book as it was like a bird's eye view into the period with characters often left on the sidelines of history. Oh, and the cover is STUNNING.ted in the tale.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Fantastic product. Light, innovative. It seems smart, opened and worked easily and intuitively. The responsible packaging from Marware is especially interesting.
0553801473|2.0|I really liked the earlier books! Really! In fact, the two stars are primarily as a \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\" (5 for the first 3 books, minus 1 for book 4, minus 2 for book 5). GRRM has either gotten senile or greedy (in a Peter Jackson - \\"Hey, lets make THREE movies out of the Hobbit\\" - kind of way). Anyway, as others have pointed out, almost nothing actually happens in this book. And there is no convergence either - in fact, instead of threads being pulled together, more threads are randomly added. There are now so many open threads that it is practically impossible for the series to end in two more books, without the introduction of a space-time warp that will magically land every character in the middle King's Landing with their swords, direwolves and dragons.<br /><br />To list the open threads that I can think of (SPOILER ALERT!!!):<br /><br />1. Daenerys - After proving her child-like incompetence at actually ruling (paraphrasing Che Guevara - \\"Blowing up trains is easy. It's a lot more difficult to make them run on time\\"), she has now met up with a new khalasar and has her favorite dragon in tow. She will now use her new army to attack Meereen (again) and screw things up (again). Or she will lay waste to Qarth.  Or she will march on Westeros (finally), although why she didn't do that with her army of Unsullied is anyone's guess.<br /><br />2. Jon Snow - In keeping with GRRM's \\"Screw Ned Stark and his family\\" approach to writing, Jon has been knifed, Caesar-like, by his comrades. However, since he has not been definitively declared dead, he will probably be brought back to life by Melisandre (a la Beric Dondarrion and Catelyn) and then go off to fight the Others as the harbinger of Light.<br /><br />3. Tyrion - Having thrown in with Ben Plumm he will now wait for Dany's next move. If she marches back to Meereen they may finally meet (hooray). If she marches on Westeros, he will spend another 1000 pages looking for where the whores go.<br /><br />4. Bran -He has now become an honorary child of the forest and a full-fledged warg. What he can or will do with these powers is anyone's guess - since all he has done till now is spook Theon in the Winterfell weirwood.<br /><br />5. Stannis - Last seen gnashing his teeth in the snow. Since he has spent all of book 5 in that state, it is probable that he is permanently frozen and will eventually show up in Madame Tussaud's. The Bolton's claim to have killed him, but since that would be blessed relief for all concerned, it's probably a ruse.<br /><br />6. Theon Greyjoy - Last seen with the fake Arya in Stannis' camp, missing sundry toes, fingers and teeth. If there is any closure or justice in this fictional world, he will kill Ramsay Bolton. But there isn't, so he won't.<br /><br />7. Asha Greyjoy - Reunited with Theon. Life sucks if you are a Greyjoy. In fact, if you are ironborn you should probably consider killing yourself.<br /><br />8. Arya - By the time she finally becomes a Faceless Woman, everyone else in the story will be dead of natural causes. Since she is no one, she won't care. She will be kick-ass in the next Assassin's Creed game, though.<br /><br />9. Rickon - No one knows where he is. He will go on a quest in book 7. He will meet no other primary character till book 10, and since he had the misfortune to be born a Stark, GRRM will promptly kill him.<br /><br />10. Sansa - I so totally don't care about Sansa. Hopefully one of the dragons will eventually cook and eat her.<br /><br />11. Littlefinger - We know he is plotting, scheming and plotting some more. We have no clue about what. He and Varys will be the ones left standing when all else is gone. They will duke it out man-to-ahem for total control of Westeros. Littlefinger will lose, overcome by grief when Sansa gets cooked and eaten. He will retire to the woods and spend the rest of his days with the re-animated Catelyn.<br /><br />12. Loras Tyrell - Spends books 4 and 5 in a grievously wounded state. Shows no signs of either recovering or dying. He will probably come back as a man-machine (see below: The Mountain).<br /><br />13. Margery Tyrell - She shows all the signs of growing up into what Cersei would have been had Robert loved her.<br /><br />14. Cersei - The small percentage of King's Landing's population that hadn't had sex with her already gets to at least see her naked. She continues to plot the destruction of all of her enemies, which list includes everyone in the world.<br /><br />15. Tommen - Plays with small animals and Margery. Will probably die soon.<br /><br />16. Jaime - Secures the Riverlands while showing off his newfound negotiating skills. Sets off on a quest to find the Stark kids with Brienne. The two of them will almost certainly hook up eventually and have beautiful sons and ugly daughters.<br /><br />17. Brienne - Continues her miserable existence and fails at pretty much everything she tries (I will protect Renly - oops. I will now protect Catelyn Stark - oops. I will get Jaime to King's Landing - sorry about the hand. I will find Sansa and Arya - please don't hang me, damn!). Apparently still alive - may just be to make babies with Jaime.<br /><br />18. Varys - Turns out he was a Targaryen sympathizer all along. All that talk about serving the realm without caring about who was on the throne was all hogwash - dragons rule, man! See Littlefinger, above - Varys will eventually rule the world as a composite King/Queen.<br /><br />19. Sam - Has reached the Citadel (was that in book 4?). Has set some things in motion. Doesn't know what. Does he become a Maester or do he and Gilly hook up? Does anyone care?<br /><br />20. Catelyn - Was dead but is now undead. Killed a Frey or two, and then sentenced Brienne to death. In an ironic twist of fate, she and Jon Snow will live on together as apostles of the light. She will so totally hate him for it.<br /><br />21. Doran Martell - His gout keeps getting worse, as will his ulcers when he finds out what happened to his son. He had one plan, which has now been burnt to a crisp. Looks like he may have to let the viper's daughters loose after all.<br /><br />21a. Quentyn Martell - Winner of a Darwin award. Tried to break in to the dragon's lair and ride off with one. Burnt to a crisp. Thankfully this is one thread that is really closed. Unless it isn't.<br /><br />22. The Hound - Supposedly died of an infected wound. But his spirit (and helm) live on - this may eventually have some significance, though I suspect not.<br /><br />23. The Mountain - Supposedly died of poisoning, but in the most obvious literary build-up of all time, has been reconstituted into some sort of man-machine-monster (aka RoboCop). He and Loras Tyrell's reconstituted man-machine (see above) will have an epic death match when Cersei and Margery choose them as their champions at their respective trials. This will be a recreation of their duel in the tourney in book 1 - at least something will come full circle.<br /><br />24. Aegon Targaryen - GRRM's afterthought (How can I make this book even bigger? Hmm, what if I make another Targaryen live?). Has attacked Westeros to impress Dany. Neither Dany nor anyone else has noticed or cares.<br /><br />25. Jon Connington - Aegon's protector/advisor/general/hand. Trying to make up for his abject failure as Aerys' Hand. Leading the attack on Westeros, but bad PR has failed him.<br /><br />26. Ser Barristan Selmy - Has successfully overthrown Hizdahr in Meereen, and will now lead a dumb-ass attack on the siege armies. Man knows not when to hang up his boots. Will serve Dany till Aegon comes along.<br /><br />27. Victarion Greyjoy - Sailing, sailing to find (and marry) Dany and the dragons. We all know how that ends.<br /><br />28. Euron Greyjoy - Waiting, waiting for Victarion to return with Dany and the dragons (whom he will then marry). We all know how that ends. The ironborn should seriously just drown themselves.<br /><br />29. Davos Seaworth - The travelling salesman, has visited many a Lord to win them over to Stannis. Keeps losing his ships everywhere he goes - not quite what you would expect from a sailor/smuggler.<br /><br />30. Mance Rayder - Helps Theon escape. May or may not be a captive of the Boltons at Winterfell. Will eventually lead the wildlings against everyone.<br /><br />31. Roose and Ramsay Bolton, the Frey clan - Mean little bitches. Will get their just desserts from somebody, but who? Catelyn, Theon, Jon, Stannis?<br /><br />32. Gendry - You would think there would be a point to bringing Arya Stark and King Robert's bastard son together in books 1 and 2, but since then he has been stuck with the Dondarrion rebels, doing jack.<br /><br />Whew! That's all I can think of at the moment, though I'm sure I've missed quite a few. If you guys think this is all coming together in the near future, you've been smoking something strong. HBO has a \\"Days of Our Lives\\" on their hands.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I downloaded this app bc I an so addicted to pinterest and thought it would just be something id get on a few times but then go back to the browser. but I was wrong, I cant stay off it and repinning is very simple. I only wish I could save some of the photos to my kindle..
B00280LYHS|5.0|Just as interesting as the first 4! This item came to my kindle, easy to use and the book was great!

B007V2UGPE|4.0|very fun game but the coins are worthless at higher levels. should be able to trade coins for gold. like every 50,000 =a gold piece
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I've been waiting so long for it to come out on my kindle fire! The only downside of this game is that it kina gets boring after a day or two.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Bared to You: A crossfire novel. Wow! It's the grown up version of '50 Shades'. You wonder how this is possible but when you've read it you'll understand why.<br />Gideon is uber-sexy. You won't be able to put it down.
B005VR91UW|5.0|These are the cleanest sounding renditions of this material I've ever heard.  I've never heard the instrumental backings come through so clearly.  The info booklet with the set is excellent; complete discographical material is especially welcome.  My only complaint is I could've used more detailed directions on how to view the bonus videos on the disc.  By trial-and-error, I was able to download them using Quicktime; I had no luck with Windows Media Player.  I recommend this set even if you already have most of the songs on other discs(as I do).
B00785P2QC|4.0|i played this game  6 month ago an d got tired from waiting to get rewards. it looks like after update will be different. i hope so.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's not often I find a book that I don't want to put down.  Gone Girl was one of those books.  I found myself thinking about the characters while I was going about my day to day business.  By the end of the book I was questioning how well I really knew the people around me.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|Great ending to a very over the top show! Love how the story came a complete 180 to the very first episode. Also love how Ryan left the series with unanswered questions in case Nip/Tuck ever comes back.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|this is a good wind down apres or in lieu of the all consuming violence of those ever angry birds.
B002BVXYRC|5.0|I'm really happy with this. I just got it a couple days ago and the it arrived in GREAT shape. Its smaller than I expected, (not a bad thing at all), its about the size of a normal CD case. Whats really clever though, is that the material that the case is made out of feels like a book cover. Obviously a reference to the album cover artwork.<br /><br />Here's all the cool stuff it comes with:<br /><br />First of all, the CD booklet (which contains pages and pages of artwork for Amnesiac), then, you have this little mock library check out card and some fake names printed on it to look like they were scribbled on there (really clever how they did that one), you get 2 art prints (one for Pyramid Song, the other for Knives Out) on a paper/card material (they're the same size as the case itself), then of course you get the CD for the album itself, a 2nd CD containing b-sides and live versions, and then the DVD containing Live versions.<br /><br />Overall a really enjoyable issue of this album. If you plan on getting this album then get this edition its even for a great price!
B004WDRSO2|5.0|Movie shipped very quickly! I love that it was brand new and the price was less than half of what you'd pay in the store. I'm very happy with this purchase!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Thor and Loki from Asgard make the movie period.  Without them, even if they used other superheroes I think the movie would be boring for lacking an emotional component that is provided by the brother's fractured relationship.  I really felt very sorry for Thor having to deal with his insane brother and Loki was pure evil, entertaining for sure, but pure evil nonetheless.  I don't know how Loki can be redeemed (from evil to just wicked), but I hope somehow it's managed in Thor II which doesn't come out to next year of course.<br /><br />Everyone talks about Robert Downey Jr., and even the man who played the Hulk, but it is the Asgard brothers, Thor and Loki, that gives this movie its heart.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />The Bluray DVD is great, it's just like watching the movie in the theater (that is if you have a high definition, 1080p TV, which I imagine most people do by now).
B001F12J48|5.0|THE MOVIE WAS GREAT WOULD WATCH IT AGAIN WITH ALL MY GRAND KIDS. JUST WISH THE GLASSES WERE BETTER.IN FACT JUST ORDERED SOME PLASTIC ONES FROM AMAZON.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|now I know why they call it the joy ride its the best joy u can have playing this game
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I like this much better than Accuweather.  If you're thinking, \\"I already have Accuweather, I don't need another weather app,\\" order this one and you'll quickly kick AccuWeather to the curb.  The depth and breadth of this app leave Accuweather in the dust, and edge out even Weatherbug.<br /><br />There is, however, one major problem: using the widget on my Home screen absolutely killed my battery life.  Where I used to go to sleep with a fully charged phone and wake up with about 75% of batttery remaining--the night after I installed this app and placed the widget on my home screen, my battery went from being at about 80% around bedtime to being GONE by around 5 in the morning.  So some work is needed on the widget to make sure it only syncs up at the selected interval (once every 30 minutes works fine for me) so it doesn't drain the battery.<br /><br />That problem aside, this app rocks...if the widgets didn't suck my battery dry I'd have given this five stars, no question.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very thorough! Times for charging are spot on for the Kindle Fire. I know it's a phone app, but it really gives a nice quick look from status bar on how much life is left in the battery. Actually got it for my phone also.

B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I really love this game. it is the bomb, bit every good thing comes with a consequense. the game does glitch out frequently during flying the jetpack. just wanted to say so that you guys know what goes on in game and give some people some insight. other than that awesome game its about time Amazon got this game.
B002BWP49C|3.0|DVD was in good condition. The film was clear and crisp quality. As far as the movie itself, there is probably not much to be said. I bought it as a birthday gift for someone else but it isn't my favorite. It's great if you like that kind of thing and awful if you don't. I don't know if it is possible at this point to approach a Twilight film, especially Breaking Dawn, from an objective standpoint.<br /><br />The awkwardness regarding the marriage night was charming and enjoyable. That is probably the one thing I found particularly good. The story seems directionless and the \\"twist\\" regarding Jacob was beyond bizarre. I have heard many book fans try and explain to me why it isn't weird but I don't see how anyone can see it any other way. You can decide for yourself. The acting is, well, Twilight acting. The dialogue is, well, Twilight dialogue. The soundtrack is, well, a Twilight soundtrack. Also, one scene where I could no longer attempt to take the film seriously was an angry telepathic conversation amongst the wolves.<br /><br />If you find the Bella/Edward romance believable and compelling you will like this film. If you don't then you will probably not. For those who don't enjoy it, there is one way I can recomend. That is to watch it with the Rifftrax audio and listen to Mike Nelson, Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy rip it apart and you will be sure to find a silver lining in Breaking Dawn.
0439023513|4.0|I've heard from a lot of people that this book was their least favorite in the trilogy, but I think this one was probably the best.  It has a different feel from the other two, loads more violence and is just...grittier.  But, I liked the ending.  It seemed to be a natural conclusion rather than a forced \\"everyone lives happily ever after\\" ending.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|I was really surprised with this book. Characters were loveable and had great chemistry. Their love story slowly unraveled as you read the book. Just as it should. There were some serious and some funny parts. You can't help but love the characters. Martise was a sweet little underdog heroine. Silhara was a great hero. You can't help but love the stinky dog and the mute servant Gurn. I couldn't make myself put the book down and read most of it in one night. It was all well worth being sleepy at work the next day. I couldn't wait to get home to finish it. What a deal for only $2.99. Wow. I hope the author writes more. She's definitely on my instant buy list.
0439023491|4.0|I really love Hunger Games, and this book did not disappoint!  It was just a good, entertaining read.  I read this book faster than I have read any other book, as I just couldn't put it down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this app to come out. It has run great and I have already logged hours on pinterest. I highly recommend this to any pinteredt User.  Great job pinterest!
0345803493|2.0|I thought the first book was good, but this one is getting too mushy for my taste.  A little bit too much like Twilight, and the writing is not great.
0316056863|5.0|Oh, my gosh! Tina Fey IS Liz Lemon! She truly is... and I love her the more for it. I think the statement that endeared her the most was:<br /><br />\\"As my friend's husband fed the baby, he said nonchalantly, 'This stuff is like liquid gold. You know it actually makes them smarter?'<br /><br />'Let's set a date!' I screamed. 'IQ test! Five years from today! My formula baby will CRUSH your baby!'<br /><br />...Fortunately my mouth was full of cake so they couldn't understand me.\\"<br /><br />It's just the cute, funny and bizarre events of her life that have led to the moment of now, where she is writer, actress, wife (of Jeff Richmond) and mother (of now two Alice and Penelope, though still contemplating second pregnancy at the end of the book), not always in that order, of course. I also learned that she has class, and the same fears of confrontation that many of us have. And that she is not afraid to embrace the fact that she's somehow a Northern-Raised Redneck, which I also find adorable.<br /><br />If someone can be both earnest and glib, it's in this book.
0345803507|2.0|Sorry, I'm just not buying it.  I thought the first book was good, but my eyes were rolling back in my head (not in a good way) during the second and third books.  I swear the author was just cutting and pasting, there was so much repetition.  And I never want to read or hear the word \\"mercurial\\" again.  Get a thesaurus, lady.<br />Also, what is it with dominators and the name \\"Grey?\\"  John Grey from the \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\" movie, Edward Gray in the movie \\"Secretary,\\" and Noel Graydon from \\"Liberty in Restraint.\\"
1936608898|5.0|My full review is actually written on my website [...]    I highly recommend everyone get this book and buy one for their friends or family members! You will not be disappointed. It's a fantastic book filled with great, easy to understand information!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is awesome because it has many things you can do. For example you can change the music, jetpack etc.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great Game My granddaughter loves to play with me. The only problem is needing paid for items to complete some of the tasks
0515141429|4.0|IT KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT. I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN. IT HAD A REAL \\"TWIST\\" AT THE END,<br />NOTHING AT ALL LIKE I SUSPECTED IT TO END. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THE REST OF THE JACK REACHER SERIES.
B005LAIGNC|1.0|... And Cuba Gooding Jr. is No Cuba Gooding Jr.<br /><br />If you want to see a good movie about the Tuskegee Airmen, buy \\"The Tuskegee Airmen.\\" Brilliant acting, brilliant story and brilliant directing.<br /><br />If you want to see George Lucas' attempt to bring Jar Jar into the middle of WW2, buy this. The racism and struggles these brave men had to go through was treated like a sick joke.<br /><br />In every possible way, this movie stinks. From the CGI plane battles to the shallow story to the bad acting.<br /><br />Buy \\"[[ASIN:B005411P6I The Tuskegee Airmen [Blu-ray]]].\\" Buy two copies. It's a great movie. Don't buy this.

B004UXUX4Q|4.0|Directed by the creator of the Oscar-winning SIDEWAYS, The Descendants starts when Matt King, a \\"back-up\\" father (his words) must slow down his career to take care of his two daughters (17 and 11) while his wife is in the hospital in a comma caused by a boat accident. Soon we learn, his wife, spurned by Matt's long absences and indifference, was having an affair. Matt and his older daughter decide to search for this man they never met dragging along the younger girl and the oldest girl's boyfriend, and, of course, the viewer.<br /><br />The Descendants has many things going for it. George Clooney, for one, beautiful views of two of the islands of Hawaii, a strong story that does not shy away from reality and avoids the sugarcoating so prevalent in Hollywood movies, and great acting from all the actors including the aforementioned Mr. Clooney.<br /><br />Yet, I cannot say I loved it.<br /><br />Why? Because it is a realistic take on fatherhood and marriage and, after watching the trailer, I expected something lighter.<br /><br />This is not the movie's fault. The Descendants is a serious movie and that's perfectly all right. I like serious movies. But not when I am expecting something else.<br /><br />So, now that you know, please go and enjoy. It's worth seeing. Just don't go for the laughs.
B00005AR3G|5.0|Couldn't be happier! Received the product fast, and just as described. Love the movie and needed to find another copy fast as a present. Amazon never lets me down :)
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Originally aired in 2003 in Great Britain, and in 2011 in the States, this BBC produced six-part series calls for compulsive watching.<br /><br />Directed by David Yates and written by Paul Abbott, State of Play follows a group of journalists, John Simm, Kelly Macdonald, Bill Nighy, and James McAvoy investigating the death of a young assistant to a Member of Parliament, David Morrissey.<br /><br />Apart from having an absolutely enthralling storyline, the series is perfectly cast. Watch for an Oh so very young James McAvoy and a wonderful Kelly Macdonald playing a Scottish lass. I love her accent.
B007SGM084|5.0|EL James is a wonderful writer!  She makes the characters come to life in her best selling book.  The 3 books were a pleasure to read.  I could not stop reading them once I started!  A definite page turner.  Best books I have read in a long time.  I can't wait for her to write another book!  I definitely will buy anything she writes!
B003Y5H574|4.0|The battle of the sexes is over and we won, Ryan Gosling's character, Jacob, tells Cal (Steve Carell from The Office) at the beginning of the serious comedy (and that is an oxymoron, I know) Crazy, Stupid, Love.<br />Jacob, a cad in his thirties, is quite successful at picking up women at bars and likes it that way.<br />Forty something years old Cal, on the other hand, is a mess after his wife of 25 years confesses to him of having an affair and asks for a divorce.<br /><br />When the two meet in a singles bar, Jacob offers unsolicited advice to fashion Cal after Jacob's ideal man (mainly himself).<br /><br />Twenty something Hannah (Emma Stone) is studying for her bar exam. She is also hoping her boring, self-centered boyfriend will propose to her, to the dismay of her girl friend who worries that if Hannah is content to marry such a loser, what kind of man would she have to settle with? (Because, according to Hollywood, looks is all that matters in the mating game).<br /><br />At the same time, Cal's fourteen year old son, Robbie, is insanely in love with his babysitter, Jessica, who is seventeen and has a huge crush on Cal. Cal, of course, is totally oblivious to the fact.<br /><br />So the movie starts.<br /><br />It gets more complicated as Cal becomes a cad himself and has his pick of women at the bar. One of them will get him in trouble later in one of the implausible plot twists, while Jacob falls for a woman. And Hannah's boyfriend does not propose, and Robbie pursues his love undaunted by multiple rejections and Jessica makes a bold move.<br /><br />And so the movie goes, with twists and turns unpredictable and not so much, to a final confrontations that worked for me and an epilogue of sorts, Hollywood style, that didn't work at all.<br /><br />Crazy, Stupid, Love is entertaining and if you like comedies I'm sure you will love it.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Let's face it, when we hear they're making a movie out of one of our favorite books, we have two reactions. First:  Yes!  We want to see the story come to life before our eyes.  The second is fear.  \\"I hope they don't f*** it up.\\"<br /><br />Hollywood does it to us all the time.  They take a fabulous book and they butcher it as they make the screen adaptation.<br /><br />When I went to see \\"The Hunger Games\\" movie, I held my breath.  How were they going to pull it off?  So much of the story is in Katniss' head.<br /><br />As the story unfolded before my eyes, I kept expecting Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Katniss Everdeen, to start talking to herself or at least have a voice over.  But she didn't.  Jennifer was able to show Katniss' thoughts and feelings without uttering a word.  She was absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />Effie and Haymitch were exactly how I pictured them down to a T.  I loved the Lady Gaga-ish costuming of the Capital and yet they were still able to make it look both beautiful and scary at the same time.<br /><br />They stayed very true to the story, anything that was left out, I understood why and it didn't bother me.  The only line that was left out that I didn't understand why was one of my favorites.  Where Peeta is laying in the river and tells Katniss she can kiss him any time now.  I really loved that line and wished they'd left it in.<br /><br />Everything else from casting to how they pulled it off was absolute magic, something I never say about a film adaptation.  The pacing, the acting, the camera work.  Fabulous.<br /><br />I was blown away by this movie and give it five stars across the board.  I can't wait to see what they do with \\"Catching Fire.\\"
B002SF9YUM|5.0|Little Ashes is a fictionalized portrait of the relationship between three of the most charismatic and talented Spanish artists of the twentieth century: Federico García Lorca, Salvador Dalí and Luís Buñuel. Its title comes from the name of one of Dalí's early paintings that Lorca and Dalí discuss during an idyllic holiday they spend together in the Catalan coast.<br /><br />Little Ashes starts in 1922 when a 24 years old Lorca first meets Dalí, then 18. Lorca is shaken by his strong attraction to this shy and narcissistic youth who thinks himself a genius.<br /><br />That Lorca was homosexual there is no doubt today. But to be homosexual in Spain in the 1920s was not something to flaunt about because it was a crime punishable with 14 years of forced labor. Besides, Spain was a strictly Catholic country, and Lorca raised in this belief would have perceived his sexual inclination to be a sin and a shame for his whole family.<br /><br />What all this means is that Lorca and Dalí's relationship would not have been an easy one in the best of circumstances. If you add to this Dalí's pathological fear of being touched, Buñuel's jealousy over loosing Lorca's friendship, a smitten girl's determination to make Lorca love her back, and a country already split in two political factions that eventually will fight each other to death during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), you will have some of the ingredients that make this movie such a powerful and heart wrenching story.<br /><br />The actors, both the Spanish and the British, are excellent, including an almost unrecognizable Robert Pattison (of Twilight fame) as Dalí, and the movie is a fascinating portrait of an era.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Glad they made this time consuming game. it's cute and keeps me busy when I'm bored. Just think it shouldn't have liking goals...
B0058YPL66|5.0|Once Upon a Time is a retelling/a continuation of sorts of Snow White with characters from other beloved fairy tales (Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Rumplestiltskin) and children stories (Pinocchio) added to the mix. The story takes place in the present day Storybrook, Maine and  in the past of a parallel world where the characters lived before the Evil Queen's curse stole their happy endings and sent them to our world.<br /><br />In the present, all the Fairy Tale characters have with no recollection of their past and, as time has stopped, they don´t age. But this changes when Henry, an 11 years old boy who is Snow White grandchild and has been adopted by the Evil Queen, escapes the town and, after finding his mother, Emma Swan, brings her with him back to Storybrook.<br /><br />Henry learned of the curse in the book his teacher Mary Margaret (Snow White) gave to him. He knows that only Emma, the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming, can break the curse. But no one believes his stories. No one but his adoptive mother, the Evil Queen and present day major, who is intent on sending Emma away.<br /><br />The story sounds complicated and even lame, but it's not. It's a wonderfully crafted story created by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, the writers of \\"LOST\\". It has the appropriate amount of romance and adventure, and is perfectly cast.<br /><br />As the teaser on ABC website puts it: \\"Brace yourself for a modern fable with thrilling twists and hints of darkness. Brimming with wonder, and filled with the magic of our most beloved fairytales.\\"<br />Don't miss it!

B008476HBM|5.0|This book was so interesting! I sat reading and could hardly put it down. It has great suspense which I truly enjoyed. I am a romantic and anything that ends in true love is great. However most of the language (old English) can be challenging to read initially but you eventually get used to it.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|I think this game is really enjoyable. But the prices of the gear get so high that its not as enjoyable. Also I had an infuriating gold glitch. I had 20,000 and then suddenly I go back to it and I have only 9,000. I was mad, but I began saving up again. I had 15,000 when it did it again and I ended up with 5,000 now. Another thing is the daily challenges don't appear 'daily' for me.
B000W4E3OS|4.0|Formally correct, but without sparkling, astonishing flight which is needed  by this music.<br />Scriabin was crazy indeed , delirant and fond of an idea of life married with death, dreaming  a kind of music coupled with colours and wild emotions.<br />Sometime I heard fatigue in this pianist but nevermind the median level is high in terms of intelligence and clearity.
1594135851|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I've ever read.  I'm usually a novel per month person, just reading before bed at night.  This book I went through in 3 or 4 days.

It's not to hard to get used to, but some people might be annoyed if they didn't notice it was large print when you ordered it.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|Caution: this is one of those books you'll want to stay up all night reading. The characters and story hooked me from the start. As with all of Blake Crouch's books, the writing here is vivid. I felt like I was experiencing it all right alongside the characters.<br /><br />Pines is a thriller with nonstop action. There are some great twists, and the ending took me by complete surprise. The last few pages gave me one of those rare 'wow' moments. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush, this one's for you.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I received an advanced copy of this book and it felt like reading something from the twilight zone. I wouldn't call this a thriller nor horror tho at all. I really wished the ending was better tho and closed up some loose ends. I was quite impressed with this book and the overall ending. I'm looking forward to the next one to see where he's going with it.

B0015AARJI|3.0|I bought this controller to Bluetooth to my phone. Well... as an earlier reviewer mentioned, this controller is lesser quality then an original. If feels differently too. It is not able to connect to my phone. I was however able to trade it for an older version via a friend and his did work and this one worked with his PS3. So no worries in the long run. Just be careful that if you need this for anything other then a PS3 it may not work.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|I'm a sucker for horror and the macabre, as well as Blake Crouch. I was very fortunate enough to snag a precious ARC of PINES.<br /><br />What can I say? This book spoke to me in volumes. I'm a complete TV junkie and PINES was like reading my favorite television shows all at once and I didn't want to turn it off, less I miss something. A copulation of The Outer Limits, The Twilight Zone, Twin Peaks, all came into mind as I read this thriller of a book. What happens when a Secret Service agent finds himself trapped in an all idyllic town?<br /><br />Crouch set out to write a book they way he saw fit, from conception to execution, and it definitely came across in PINES. His inspiration behind the story became clear and it resonated in every page he wrote...I felt it from page one.<br /><br />I'd love to see Blake continue the story...
B007TNS6JI|3.0|the game was fun not Very fun and the kindle fire gets super late updates to a point where it is dispicable and amazon should do something about it
B008BDZP30|4.0|For starters, this is one of the newly remastered recordings that have made sonic improvements over previous versions.  For the uninitiated, this is a transitional Zappa recording released after two Mothers of Invention albums in 1970. The hardcore fans will get it, and the ones who aren't sure, should get it anyway.  Too many great songs to pass this one by. The title track alone Chunga's Revenge is one of my favorites.  Tell Me You Love Me rocks hard.  There's some blues, jazz, avant garde, and humor involved. This should not be overlooked.  Put the headphones on.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|A friend loaned me this book and I am just amazed how Mr. Ryan writes, I liked the writing so much I felt the need to share with everyone this is my first review and I have to say you won't see me do this very often.<br />If you like fantasy, I dare to say Mr. Ryan novel is up there with the best.<br />I wish Mr. Ryan the best and can't wait for book 2

B001OSIV62|4.0|Honestly, this is a movie I started watching by accident, not intent. (I thought this was \\"Man on a Ledge\\" I just had the title wrong.)  But since I was busy eating my nachos and my fingers were messy, I let it play figuring I'd change it when I finished eating.<br /><br />Wire walking takes incredible skill, natural ability and guts and I can appreciate all that - but to me it's not particularly exciting/interesting to watch someone walk back and forth. Perhaps partly because I don't expect them to fall I guess. But I found myself more and more absorbed and appreciative of the incredible amount of planning and commitment and risk - and by the people telling the story.<br /><br />Amazingly, there is a lot of original footage in this film and the excitement and energy of the people involved sortof pulls you in like a magnet.  The story is told with great detail and enthusiasm/energy and you understand that Philippe is passionately driven to do this.  The kind of passion and drive that can't be stopped as long as there is a breath in the body and a mind to dream with.  This is a guy who looks at the feat and says, \\"yes, sure I could die in a moment here - it could all end now... but it would be sooo worth taking this chance - this big bite out of LIFE\\"  And when you watch his face go from stress/anxiety to taking those first few steps on the wire and suddenly breaking into a fully joyous expression... well,for a few moments you can sortof feel that too. It was an incredible achievement.<br /><br />This documentary was extremely well done. I'm glad I saw it, even if only by mistake.<br />:-)<br /><br />PS:  some subtitled parts
B005FISBTO|4.0|After a disappointing fifth season, \\"Dexter\\" rebounds here with a riveting series of episodes that will keep you wanting more. Season 5 of \\"Dexter\\" suffered from the mistake of not introducing the main plotline until nearly halfway in (and it really wasn't that compelling a story once it did kick in making for the weakest season yet). I was worried the show would continue on its downward spiral, but thankfully the writers redeem themselves this go-'round. While it doesn't pack the wallop of Seasons 4 or 1, this collection is far superior to Season 3 (with Jimmy Smits) or the lacklustre Season 5 (with Julia Stiles).<br /><br />Dexter must embrace religion this season by helping track down the Doomsday Killers and befriending ex-convict-turned-preacher Brother Sam. The religious theme allows for some terrific gruesome set pieces as the Doomsday Kills are re-enactments of the Book of Revelations (a group of horses and a greenhouse scene are so particularly creepy they will stay with the viewer for days). The storyline also allows the writers to use one of the show's more familiar gimmicks against the audience, yet we never feel cheated.<br /><br />The writers wisely shake things up at Miami Metro, where staleness was setting in. Laguerta and Deb are both promoted, and Quinn and Battista are now partners, which opens up a whole new bunch of plot possibilites. Work and personal pressures take their toll on Deb and she begins seeing a therapist. Quinn jeopardizes his career with a run of destructive behaviour after Deb rejects his marriage proposal. Masuka is still the pervy comic relief, but even he gets to tread new waters as the writers pair him up with a series of new interns. A new officer named Anderson transfers in from Chicago but the character doesn't make much of a splash.

1416583408|2.0|I came across this book in an airport bookstore.  I read a few passages and it seemed like a great book to learn about what it's like to be a dog.  It had a few interesting tidbits, but mostly it was was filled with \\"science-like\\" statements or observations that seemed more opinion or unscientifically based (i.e. the so-called \\"experiment\\" where owners faked heart attacks or being injured by a bookcase...  as another reviewer noted, why didn't she consider the idea that the dogs knew they were faking??).  Sections of the book were extremely boring and didn't seem to \\"say\\" much, even after I reread them several times.<br /><br />I had high expectations that this book would shed light on my dogs' experiences of life, but this book didn't come close to being what I hoped for.
1932735410|5.0|Just took the PMP Exam on 20 Aug 2012 and PASSED MY FIRST TIME!  The PMP Exam Prep, Seventh Edition is an excellent book.  I had used another book to study and got some basics, then picked this book up a few weeks before the test.  I can tell you, without a doubt, I would NOT have passed without this book!!  Don't worry about the comments about the book being negetive and making you feel unworthy.  The old versions may have been like that, but this one has no negetivity in it.  Also do not let the small print scare you, it flows well and is easy to read.  The examples and questions are perfect for studying for the exam.  The only thing I did not like was the CD that comes with it only had a limited amount of questions on it, wish it would have at least had a 200 questions prep test.<br />I spent about 60 hours in this book.  Read it and highlighted areas I though were important or did not know and then when I finished it I took the free test(listed below) then two days before the exam just went back throuh the book reviewing just the areas that I had highlighted.<br /><br />You can get a free online 200 question prep test at PMStudy.com and headfirstlabs.com.  The headfirst is a good one to start with, not super hard.  The PMStudy test was closer to the real exam, but both are free and will certainly help.<br /><br />Good luck!

B006JN5KBG|5.0|7/8/14 UPDATE: Twilight Time has confirmed these re-releases for 2015: 1). FRIGHT NIGHT (1985), 2). CHRISTINE (1983), 3). JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH (1959) (brand new 4k restoration). FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO BUY THEM BEFORE, JUST A WORD OF CAUTION IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY THEM FROM THESE SCALPERS ON AMAZON. I know that many have mentioned that the price is absolutely crazy. I have been chewing at the bit wondering at what point I would be out of luck getting a copy of it. What if it were to never come back out on blu-ray? I would be kicking myself for it. I finally broke down, closed my eyes, gritted my teeth and clicked purchase....one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. I was lucky in that I was able to secure Mysterious Island and Journey to the Center of the Earth at the 29.99 price, however, had missed Fright Night because I didn't know about it until after it had sold out within a month (November 2011). Now third party vendors currently have Mysterious Island (9 copies) between 84.00-85.00 and Journey to the Center of the Earth (10 copies) between 68.00-69.00. Do I think its price gouging?...yes...but in the end am I glad I was able to get a copy...it's the law of supply & demand...I will review the technical aspects once I watch it....

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I've been looking around for a camera bag that's not noticeably a camera bag and at the same time roomy and compact. In addition it had to be reasonably priced. This is very spacious, with several dividers for you to organize the inside accordingly. To give you a sense of how roomy it is, I can fit a 70-200 f2.8 attached to a 5d mkii with 2 prime lenses and 2 580ex ii flashes. Theres also small compartments for batteries, filters, gels, and compact wireless transmitters. Only thing I would improve with this bag is to add a bit more padding to the bag to make it sturdier but with the price right now, I can't complain.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|You can't download this from amazon to your Android phone. I have Tubemate on my Android phone but was going to put the newest version on it - but amazon doesn't work. DON'T USE....You'll just end up frustrated!!!

B007VTVGAQ|1.0|I've been a fan of Fiona Apple since her release of Tidal.  When I heard of this new album, I purchased it.  That was a mistake.  This album is nowhere near her best work (in my opinion.)  A lot of the songs are just plain boring, and they sound the same over and over again.  I have been trying to enjoy it, but every song is dull.  Now I don't know whether to keep it until it finally grows on me, or just get rid of it.  The album is just so negative.  I recommend her previous albums.  This is just trashy!
B004LWZW88|5.0|Purchased this DVD when my family was coming to visit. We all enjoyed it and my grandson wanted to watch it more than once that weekend. Blu-ray colors are fantastic.

B0041I0N9A|5.0|The only thing better than coming of age in an economy wherein one can buy monstrous sets of lego meticulously crafted into set pieces from the classic Star Wars films is that my wife bought [italics here] the set for me.  How cool is that!<br /><br />I happen to own most of the uberLEGO sets.  Christmas always means that I get to spend a few days on the floor of the living room making my fingertips burn.  Lego fingers?  Right?  This was a particularly good example of LEGO's higher efforts because it so perfectly evokes the ship from the movie, the size of this set makes no concessions.  And it is the size that produces the effect.  Perhaps because in my younger years my parents so carefully rationed LEGO, it feels wonderful to have all the right parts in sufficient quantity and with hundreds of pages of directions so as to be able to recreate in a few days what must have taken a truly gifted LEGO artist many weeks to complete.  And the ability to so perfectly recreate the original is exactly where the satisfaction resides.<br /><br />I would guess that it took about a week's worth of evenings.  As with all supersets, the sheer number of parts can slow the builder down a bit--but this is part of the fun of these big sets.  The perfect part is always right there.  The end result looks exactly like the picture on the box and it can be torn down and recreated at will.  (You Tube has several good tutorials on how to take a large LEGO set apart, wash the bricks, and then recreate it.)  But definitely keep these white bricks out of direct sunlight, which will fade the model over time, that's no good for anyone.<br /><br />This piece will soon menace all visitors to my office.  Anyone looking to make an unforgettable impression need only gift this set; it is the best gift ever.
B00000G3I2|5.0|The ending is sort of, hmmmm, how would I say, ......  \\"can do without it\\"  but the rest of the movie is fun and entertaining.  Love the music, love the actors, just fun and I'd watch again and again.
0812993292|5.0|I just finished this book--in two sittings.  It's a wonderful book, full of sadness and joy, loss and grace, and in the end, hope.  I'm glad I read it and it will stay with me for quite a while, I'm sure.  Some of us will always have our David.  If we are fortunate, we will in the end, find our Harold is still there.<br />Just read it.
1400049628|5.0|This is actually our second of this title in less than 6 months as our 14 year old loaned it to a friend at school who lost it.  He was very disappointed, even though he read it all, he wanted it in his collection.  So, of course, the prices are so great on Amazon especially if you're a prime member, so we ordered him another copy.  He was thrilled!
0374158460|5.0|From the start of the first part until the end \\"Freedom\\" had me enthralled and I could barely will myself to put it down, I devoured the text and finished it in only a few sittings. With that said I recognize that \\"Freedom\\" is definitely not for everyone, it is a long (that alone will turn off some people) and at times brutally negative and pessimistic book that shows how the small concessions and private doubts that people make can lead to small tragedies and defeats spread over a lifetime. The plot focuses on one family, the origins of two people meeting each other in college and marrying, to the formation and fragmentation of their family. The book spans a few decades but spends the majority focused on the first few years after the September 11th attacks, with a focus on the culture of the times and the past that formed the views and beliefs of the characters. Character interactions with one another is what really made this book. The book has many sections, each one corresponding to a different character, and each section ends before the reader becomes tired of that character all the while moving the plot forward. The sections are all masterfully woven together and the characters are varied enough to be distinct, however very few of them are immediately likable or even sympathetic. The novel is not entirely tragic, there are moments of humor and not everything ends tragically. I highly recommended this book to serious and academic readers and fans of darker fiction. I do not think that this novel has universal appeal and as I result I think that fans of light fiction or more casual readers may want to give this book a pass.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is not going to be a classic in the strictest sense of the word, but it is modern love story with quite a lot of erotic sexual activity thrown in for good measure! If you are easily offended by graphic sex scenes, this is probably not the book for you. I didn't find it offensive, I found it exciting! I could see a great love story unfolding before my eyes, and that's what really held my attention the whole book through. The questions like \\" Will she be able to get over all this kinky stuff to see the real Christian?\\" were going through my mind. Christians' gradual self realisation that he did in fact love Ana hit me like a thunderbolt! Wow!! What a love story- be brave- read it ....you will love it!
B008KW43TE|5.0|I have a new favorite song every week! I love his choice of tracks as well as his ability to tell a great story that's heartfelt and honest with a hint of sarcasm. He's bringing back REAL music!
034580404X|5.0|I am so glad I decided to get on the \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" bandwagon!!!  This was an excellent read & I would recommend it to everyone including men.  I would even refer people to buy this trilogy from Amazon because it was economically priced, it was delivered in a timely manner & it was packaged & sealed without any damage!!!  Thank you Amazon!
B008D1RCI6|5.0|Is it possible to be genuinely excited by the release of an album by an obscure English songwriter who will never trouble the charts and who recorded his last album 41 years ago? The answer is an emphatic yes, not least since Bill Fay remains one of the great lost artists of British music. He is one of those unexplainable great singer songwriters whose musical footprint never left any kind of substantial imprint. It is true that over recent years Fay's stock has risen not least as his first two albums have been re-issued and he has been championed by musical heavy weights like Nick Cave and Wilco's main man Jeff Tweedy. It is only right therefore that the latter has collaborated on this album with Bill Fay and if you do nothing else after skimming through this review please download the cover version of Tweedy's \\"Jesus, etc\\" which is one of \\"Life is people\\" many stellar highlights and easily matches the original. Better still get this album and listen to the sound of a composer who has been denied his proper deserts finally get his moment and grasp it with both hands. This is music for thinking, feeling and possibly \\"experienced\\" music lovers who know that the reaching of a certain age can shatter hope and ambition but also can lead to reconciliation and greater peace of mind. Bill Fay's \\"Life is people\\" is essentially a strategic overview of life's uneven journey, charting its desperate low points in the superbly evocative street sweeper in the \\"City of dreams\\", an accommodation with faith in \\"Thank you lord\\" and in the seven minute \\"Cosmic Concerto \\"Life is people\\"\\" producing an anthem of quiet wonder.<br /><br />The tempo on this album may appear downbeat and the heavy darkness on songs like the \\"Big Painter\\" where he speaks of \\"no lessons learned over the centuries\\" show an artist who has lived through tough times. Yet he retains his optimism. Thus in the brilliant \\"Never ending happening\\" Fay brightly concludes that \\"on what's to be and what has been/ just to be a part of it/ is astonishing to me\\". Some will detect Nick Drake related melodies and influences in this album and Fay has been compared to him not least in the comparative obscurity that both singers endured, albeit that Fay happily remains with us. The Drake comparison is perhaps overstated not least since Fay's music is not quite so quintessentially English or infused with the pastoral shades of Drake's work. Indeed the lovely duet he undertakes with Jeff Tweedy on this album \\"This world\\" is almost a pop song. Other songs here suggest potential classics particularly if taken up by other more well known artists these include the almost spiritual \\"Be at peace with yourself\\" and the affirmative world-weariness of a true highlight \\"The Healing Day\\".<br /><br />Fay recently wryly commented in a interview to NPR in States that \\"Life in People\\" must not be seen as some sort of comeback album since \\"you can't make a comeback album unless you arrive in the first place. He then sardonically observed \\"I'm getting a little bit worried that I'm coming close to arriving\\". It is hardly surprising for an artist who has hidden from our worldview for over four decades that a late rush of fame may be viewed with some trepidation. Yet what we see at work is a master songwriter on \\"Life is people\\" who positively demands attention and the recognition that somewhere along the way a great talent got lost but has returned with a vengeance.e a part of it/ is astonishing to me\\".

B008P1EWIM|3.0|bottom line. It's cool and looks nice but it's not at all as good as the weather channels, app. And it's a hefty file way larger then others... and oh yea. it's 99&cent; If you want to have a quick what's the weather app that's pretty then this IS for you. If you want a detailed weather app with true real time forecast and alerts, video, and radar then this IS NOT for you.

0156030306|5.0|\\"Flowers For Algernon\\" makes up a part of the high school curriculum, but not in a way that \\"The Catcher In The Rye\\" or \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" make up. In my high school, an Anatomy class assigned their students to read and come up with a powerpoint presentation for this novel. I was taking environmental science, but chose to read it on my own. High schools should really make more of an effort to put this up here with a novel that their students should read.<br /><br />Back on topic. The novel is written in two formats. The first is that of submissions into Charlie Gordon's journal and the second is that of typical storytelling. Charlie Gordon has a low IQ and spends his days working in a bakery, where everybody loves him for his innocence. He has no connections with his family, which is explained thoroughly throughout the story. One day, a group of doctors ask him to take part in a surgery that will make him highly intelligent, just like they did on a mouse named Algernon. It looks like a success, but then Algernon begins to deteriorate... the question is... what's next for Charlie?<br /><br />When the novel is based off of Charlie's journal submissions, the writing is raw and unedited. This means when Charlie has a low IQ, there are plenty of misspellings and grammatical errors. When he becomes intelligent, this changes. This is one of the many reasons that makes this novel fantastic. Charlie is somebody that you can connect with and follow his story. In many of occasions back in the day, parents would send their children away if they had a condition that prevented them from functioning the way typical people think.<br /><br />\\"Flowers For Algernon\\" provides everything, much of which has to do with Charlie and his struggles, whether he's bearing intelligence or not. It is one of the saddest stories you will read, but the story is definitely worth it. Unless something else comes along that is incredibly spectacular, this is my favorite novel. Definitely by it, it's a rare gem in literature.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Given the reviews when \\"Gone Girl\\" first came out, I expected great things on the suspense level. Contrary to those other reviews however, I found that most of the suspense was in the beginning with most interest petering out as the book went into what amounted to extra innings. A shame since the idea was an excellent one, too bad it wasn't more focused.
B004B5W27Y|5.0|Well, there's already plenty of 5-star reviews on here, and some are a ton more in-depth than mine could ever be, but I just thought I need to add another 5-star rating cuz I love this album. I don't know Icelandic, so all my praise is solely based on their music not lyrics. I just get so swept away into the music; it's quite an experience.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I write this review even though I don't intend to finish this boring book. The author managed to take history, the arcane lore of alchemy, the legends of witches, vampires and daemons and suck the appeal out of them. Then, after she has drained the subjects from all their interesting qualities she presents them in the form of a bimbo-witch with a suburban mindset, Mary Sue vampire and hipsters who are daemons. If you have little imagination, no healthy understanding of human/animal nature, confuse stick figures with real humans, and find glittering vampires in twilight dreamy, go ahead and read the book, it will fit in snugly with your delusional worldview.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Shades of Grey was a great trilogy.  The sex was really hot and different.  However, the storyline was excellent.  Anastasia was inexperienced sexually but Christian was inexperienced in so many other ways.  He was a billionnaire, known for his shrewdness in business and he thought he had his life in order, but there was so much about life and relationships that he did not know.  It took Anastasia to teach him.  The book had such a great ending.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I read a lot of review saying how bad the acting is.  It is...<br /><br />I thought the movie was pretty good aside from the actors because what do you expect, they're actual navy seals, not a sissy like Tom Cruise or whoever.<br /><br />I like that you get an inside look at some of their tactics which is what really makes the movie for me, as well as the lifestyle of these warriors.<br /><br />For that alone I thought this was a good movie.
B000002MTU|5.0|Have to say, this is one of my favorites from Eric Clapton.  CD case arrived cracked , but I throw those away anyway.
B001IYVUEW|4.0|The movie is great, but the service (and prices) amazon provides for this film is great. I'm very happy to have bought the rights to this digital product rather than buying a dvd from some brick and mortar retailer! Great movie, great convenience!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|So I've had this now for about 5 months. 3 of those it was stuck in the fold of my backpack and I thought that it was lost. It is small, effective, and very light. The lightness of the item can be a shortcoming, even though it is a huge plus for backpacking. I emptied my backpack out after a trip and it was stuck in a little crease in the fabric. I didn't find it again until the next trip. It works great on most of my knives, my mass produced pocket knives are very sharp after a few runs through it. My hand made knifes, not so much. One knife that I usually use a stone on does not get sharp at all after this sharpener, no matter how hard I work at it. I recommend it since most people don't use handmade knives and will be happy with the size and utility. If you aren't using it for backpacking, get a heftier sharpener as this one is pretty light.
B005RUV6RO|5.0|Without a doubt, season 2 is much more compelling than season 1.  Season 1 presents the viewer with 6-episodes, while the second season has 13! The show offers more room for characters and the story-line to develop.  There seems to be more zombies, action, and drama!<br /><br />As you would expect, there are many tense scenes involving crucial \\"life and death\\" differences of opinion between Rick and Shane. Season 2 also highlights that humans can be just as much of  a threat as zombies!  Get ready for another intense thrill ride from AMC!  Can't wait for season 3 to start in October!

B008FWI8OA|5.0|SUITS, one of the brighter shows from last season has returned for Season 2 and some changes have occurred. There is still the ongoing repartee between senior lawyer Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht) and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), the beautiful but always-serious head of the firm Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) casts her spell -but now we have the return of the old partner Daniel Hardman (David Constabile) to stir up trouble. Themes are more serious, the women play a more important part - Sarah Rafferty and Meghan Markle - and the nemesis Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) is as wily and oily and repulsive as ever. The storylines continue through episodes and the writing seems to be better fleshed out this year. Good wines are better with age and that is the case with this series. Grady Harp, August 12

B004X80QNG|5.0|I was impressed at first but... Firstly after two months of information went on - as well as another 3 months forward, I received the following error:  \\"Sorry - The application Pocket INformant (process net.webis.pocketinformant) has stopped unexpectedly.  Please try again. Force Close\\"  In addition I noticed that they updated recently to enable us to use the Address Book on the Kindle Fire but everytime I try to access the address book I would also get an error.  I emailed the support yesterday and their response is that they will have version 2.03 available in the Amazon App Store soon.  That is not good enough - I use this to track my appointments for my business on my Kindle Fire, now I am forced to source another software and replug all that information again.  I want back my money<br /><br />Since contacting the developers I have gotten a newer version that Rocks!!  So now I would upgrade my vote to 5 stars
B005LAIIQC|1.0|I didn't want to see a Bourne film without Bourne. However, Renner and Norton convinced me to give it a shot. Big mistake. This movie is a pathetic attempt to revive a story that has already been told. The first half hour to 45 minutes is mind numbing talk that tries and fail to reel you in with Bourne Ultimatum flashbacks. Renner and Weisz have little or no chemistry. After an hour and a half of agony, I finally left, went home and watched the Bourne Identity. How anyone who loved the original trilogy could possibly compare it to Legacy, it makes no sense at all.

Great writing, believable characters, gripping story-line, twists and turns and thrills all combine to make this one that you won't be able to put down.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The creepy cover of this book certainly draws readers in, and I even included it in one of my cool book cover blog posts. The book's blurb promises the mystery of unraveling the horror of what occurred in an abandoned orphanage where potentially dangerous children live apart from society. In reality, Miss Peregrine's School for Peculiar Children is a young adult fantasy novel with more adolescent moments than scary scenes.<br /><br />The pacing of the first half works well enough as the first-person narrator delivers humorous observations true to a sixteen-year-old. Jacob unravels certain points about the tall tales his grandfather told him when he was growing up, only to encounter the need for more clarification. The plot device of making Jacob the son of a rich family that owns drugstores is a bit much, but works to provide the means of taking an expensive trip to the island off the coast of Wales where he attempts to gain closure over losing his grandfather.<br /><br />The use of old found photos borders on brilliant. Yet, at times, when the flow of the story is interrupted by photo placement, one has to consider if the photos truly achieve the desired effect. Perhaps the publishers could have included them as one coherent photo album in the middle or at the end of the novel rather than throughout? It was also next to impossible to read some of the handwritten correspondence via the Kindle screen.<br /><br />A school for children with strange powers that society shuns brings up instant comparisons with X-Men. Jacob is the only character who receives any sort of decent development, which is too bad considering the wide array of characters populating Ransom Riggs' literary world. At times, the imagery can be striking, especially when Jacob first explores the rotting and dilapidated orphanage or when he dives to a sunken U-Boat.<br /><br />The themes or messages in the book beg to be taken further, but Ransom Riggs keeps the depth of the novel centered on common emotions a teenager in any era would feel, albeit while surrounded by a quirky mix of fantastically peculiar book people. With the emphasis placed on WWII and Jacob's ability to see monsters, a Nazi tie-in seemed imminent, but the story never allows itself such cleverness.<br /><br />The idea of living in Loops that continually repeat a day also create interest, especially when time travel comes into play, but the concept never really gets off the ground. Jacob wrestles with which life to choose, but the implications never extend beyond him. More than a few of the characters invite thought into the messiness of life and death decisions, but none more than Enoch, who can transfer the life-force of one thing to another. Some of the most arresting images involve him and his little clay soldiers that he gives the Frankenstein treatment. The book has so much undeveloped potential!<br /><br />The second-half of the novel grows thin as the plot loses its momentum. A budding romance with Emma, the forever young but chronologically old former flame of his grandfather Abe, adds some interest and conflict, but not enough. Other plot points such as Jacob's psychiatrist repeatedly saying, \\"'I hope you're not just telling me what I want to hear'\\" become too transparent. The ending quite literally stops awkwardly and in a way that screams sequel.<br /><br />JeriWB.com (3.75 Stars \\"Liked It\\")tions a teenager in any era would feel, albeit while surrounded by a quirky mix of fantastically peculiar book people.

B00008EY7H|5.0|Excellent Video showing the expertise and the majesty of Cirque Du Soleil . If you are a fan of the Dance Ensemble then you need to get this DVD
B006ZCWTV0|3.0|Well, thought this CD was okay, its a little churchy, some songs belong in the church while celebrating his name, nothing bad about that we all need religion in these times.  The balance of the songs are low keyed and you can tell Bruce is getting on for sure.. Listen for your self.. Its worth it !
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it helps me a lot with almost everything math related it ia a very very  very fantastic  app i reccomend for everyone
B007JWC8ZC|3.0|The first part of this film is brilliant in every way. But once boot camp is over the story and the characters that work so well and that Kubrick spent so much time and did such a great job building are gone as he abandons a brilliant character study of being dehumanized and takes off to shoot \\"his  vietnam\\" The urban war is very original and the battle scenes are amazingly well done. But the boring journalist side plot with long meetings that never add up to anything, the ironic black humor of a fake documentary, the pointless hooker stuff. and characters that are totally void of anything worth following are not. The narration by Modine throughought the film is not needed instead of adding to the film it very much takes away from it. The ending is very powerful but would have been more so without modine's already annoying voice over returning to help close it.<br /><br />I think the violence in the second half of the movie is pure cinema and is brilliantly shot. But doesn't have the realism that a film like Platoon or The Thin Red Line have where you really feel the gravity of the war and violence and what you very much feel in the first half of this very film. After Boot Camp is over I really felt nothing other than a director being showy with his camera.<br /><br /> (Spoiler Alert)<br /><br />The heart and the soul of the movie is the drill instructer and once he's killed off the movie dies right along with him. Stanley was so close to pure brilliance here but I think this is his half-masterpiece.
B008XG1X18|5.0|wonderful. outstanding I love it breath takeing. amazing. colorful.<br /><br />I think this very interesting. and full of wonderful things and prodjects<br /><br />m

B004ZQRFGM|5.0|4+ stars.<br /><br />I've only recently stumbled upon Ana (thanks Amazon), and although I wasn't that impressed by my first taste ([[ASIN:B000RT3QDC Still Making History]] - which seemed like something a really talented Playboy Bunny might get produced with skilled guitar playing but with too pop/commercial sound/production to be my cup of tea), Unconditional is a whole 'nother story, and it's clear how amazingly well she can play (mostly electric strat, but also acoustic and slide guitars)! She also sings well (and writes a good tune), but it is her driving, soaring, relentless and innovative playing that really won my heart. Production is top notch - slick and clean, while still preserving a lot of energy and rawness, and the content stays focused on real blues.<br /><br />My only (small) complaint is that the cover art is a bit obvious/tacky - yeah, I admit it did get my attention, and I get that she's telling us that she's naked with her musical expression - but it also makes her seem like she's going for the throat of crass American consumerism - or maybe just middle aged blues fans. And also I was a bit disappointed to discover Sonny Landreth only actually plays on one song, somehow I had the impression he'd be a stronger presence throughout this recording. No biggy, no matter what she looks like, or who she's playing with, she sure sounds great on this recording!<br /><br />For fans of modern Blues (with obvious Stevie Ray Vaughn-like sound, and Buddy Guy-like delivery), this CD won't disappoint.
B007857FOO|5.0|These movies just keep getting better.  I am thoroughly captivated by all of the characters.  Can't wait to see Bella as a \\"newbie\\".  Sure hope the vampires and wolves don't kill each other.

B005FISBTO|1.0|This DVD is flawed by the Paramount Company and Showtime.  As soon as you put the DVD in, it shows you a promo video for Showtime which includes the ENDING to THIS SEASON.  Do not buy unless you do not watch this promo video.  You cannot fast forward it or skip it, so you would have to make a conscious effort not to watch it each time you put on the DVD.  I contacted Showtime about this issue and they did nothing to address my concerns.  They claim they will fix it for future DVDs, but I wouldn't risk it.  There is no way to tell if you are getting a new version or an old one.

B008MEM24S|5.0|The game is better than WMW because you know Perry's story! It is fun to do the mini levels as well! All the fun you get from the show is also in the game!
B00881VLCE|4.0|There are several free themes. The smallest size of pieces can be quite challenging. I really like that I can stop at any point and continue later.
B007EC27QM|5.0|It is a calculator app.  It seems to work fine.  I could probably run some check benchmark calculations on the coding but for what I use this app for it would be unnecessary.
B0036FOGTW|5.0|A thoughtful lesson of the shallowness of aid given to corrupt Africa that satisfies Western conscience and depriving the African. A wonderful masterpiece by an African for Africa. It will put paid the supposition of  the missionary attributes the NGO industry. Expats in Africa will immediately identify the major themes of a totally vain irredeemable African Political class that wears Black Heads instead of Country flags on suit lapels with the complicity of it's NGO & Western government help and the poor African who is trapped<br /><br />All should read to help.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is just what you want, no fancy jingles added. Just simple solitare. I would recommend this to any friends looking to play
B008WHTFL8|5.0|I was skeptical of how 'good' a new Darkness album would be after the long hiatus/breakup and after reading a few early reviews leading me to expect a lackluster third album...but thank goodness it was all a bad dream:).<br /><br />For the record, I am a huge fan of The Darkness. Permission to Land is one of my favorite albums. I think One Way Ticket to Hell and Back is an amazing album too (for different reasons), but it missed the mark in many aspects.  I really enjoyed the Justin Hawkins solo efforts, but I was worried about a \\"reunion\\" album/tour.<br /><br />I've only had a chance to listen to the album once through (it was just released this morning)...but so far, I loved it instantly, which is a VERY good sign for me. Even at 15 tracks (get the .mp3 album and you get four more songs!), the time flew by. Time will tell if I enjoy it as much as Permission to Land, but it certainly has potential. I do agree with the reviewers who said it is basically more of \\"The Darkness\\" so you know what you're getting, but it feels like the band has found the perfect mix between the sounds of their Permission to Land and One Way Ticket albums. If you didn't like The Darkness before, this album won't convince you either, but for those of us who do, they've given us a fantastic album and it is SO much better than I expected.  At $7.99 (as of 8/21/12) for the 15 track .mp3 album, it is a steal so do yourself a favor and get it!<br /><br />UPDATE (08/23/12) - I've had a chance to listen to the album many times now and I can say that while I still prefer the superior 'Permission to Land' (which would be hard to top, let's be honest), Hot Cakes comes a close second and feels like a great sequel to that album. I have also since learned that one the best tracks, the Iron Maiden-like \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\", is a cover of a Radiohead song.  Personally, I never enjoyed Radiohead (just not my kind of music, sorry) and the song is thankfully almost unreconizable as I can't stand the original. Go figure. Anyway, the album is getting better with each listen and it \\"Growing On Me\\" more each time.  As most have said already...if you are any kind of fan of  The Darkness, it is a must-buy.
B005FISBTO|3.0|As a huge fan of Dexter (but someone who doesn't get Showtime) I purchase the seasons right when they come out and avoid reading anything about the new season to avoid spoilers. In my opinion this is a tough item to rate...Showtime deserves a 0 for forcing viewers to watch ads(without the ability to fast forward; although annoying I \\"get\\" this on a rental but find it despicable when I've paid for the season disc) on EACH disc AND for putting a major spoiler on said ads, although a previous reviewer noted this may have been resolved.<br /><br />Relative to other seasons, I think Season 6 earns a 2.5 because of the major deviations from previous character development, an increased reliance on suspending reality (e.g., that a unit would wait for a blood splatter analyst before entering a crime scene and then have that analyst be the only one clearing the scene for an extended period of time) and a relative lack of suspense that served as an undertone for the other seasons and kept me up all night watching back-to-back episodes because I NEEDED to see what happened next. I found the new Deborah development \\"icky\\", without basis, and completely unnecessary.  (It also shatters the previously laid foundation that Dex and Deborah's relationship is not only healthy but perhaps the most healthy either of them have ever had.) Finally, I'm annoyed that they started so many potentially interesting subplots that were never developed (e.g., hand, issue with commissioner). It just seemed all over the place.<br /><br />THAT SAID, it's Dexter! And without the comparison to the quality of other seasons the episodes themselves were highly entertaining and I'd give it a 5. I suppose when you've been as exceptional as Dexter has been for 5 seasons, the only place to go may be down.  I hope it hasn't jumped the shark, but after this season I fear the worst.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|Blu ray is awesome, story & cinematography are intense & non-stop, Spielberg-esk (as in Duel or Jaws) with no maudlin or over the top sappy clap trap. Tony Scott: an incredible film maker! He used very little c.g. in this movie (watch making of), stunts are top notch, camera work is out of this world! Rest in Peace Tony, an amazing talent gone before his time.
1401235417|5.0|I'm more of a Superman, Superman and Batman, and Justice League reader, but of late have started reading Batman as well, and this one goes to one of the top reads for sure! Very exciting and well put together story. Hard to put it down. You won't be dissapointed. One thing I got a little confused about was a character in the story that comes towards the end. I had to do a little search to find out that she in fact is a new character to the Batman series itself. So in all, very happy with the purchase.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's funny, sad, has action, drama, etc.  Well written script and great acting.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The Settlers of Catan is a wonderful strategy/resource collection game that can play differently every time you sit down and set up the board. I originally played Settlers over and over and over again on Xbox live arcade. My wife was not a fan of the game until we purchased the actual copy of the game. She ended up loving it as much as I did, and we now play for hours together. The game is designed to be played with 3 to 4 players, but can be played with as little as 2 without major rule alterations. The game is very strategy based with a nice element of luck reflected in dice roles. I highly recommend Settlers for any family or friendly get togethers!<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Modular Board Setup. This gives way to endless possibilities. Every piece of the game board can be changed.<br /><br />+ Relatively easy to learn. One good play through can have you familiar with the rules. If nothing else, the game comes with a very clear instruction book.<br /><br />+ Good for the entire family.<br /><br />+ Expansions add more gameplay with new rule sets and can extend original game play to 5 to 6 players.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Price. Had I not played this on Xbox I would never have paid $30+ for it. I guess I'm just too used to classic board games being cheaper. (sidenote: I paid more than the Amazon price, having bought it at a local Target)<br /><br />- Game board durability - This is one of my biggest concerns. The game board itself is made out of a non-durable feeling cardboard; and the cards are quite thin.
B00881VLCE|3.0|loses purchased puzzles and wont let u redownload. if you try, it fails. just wasted like $10. this is ridiculous.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|this game is really really really cool! it is basicaly the same as angry birds exept they are in Rio. it is going along with the lines of the movie if you have seen it.there are a few new birds and lots of sections including smugglers den airfield chase smugglers plane etc. my only complaint is that some of the levels are almost impossible and make you mad but I guess that's why they call it angry birds! very adicting. over all I think this game is worth the dollar

B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book is soft porn and apart from extremely detailed descriptions of every sex act this couple participated in there was very little literary content or story. I purchased all three books as I understood it to be a trilogy with the continuation of a story. What story,? The plot was very weak and the book badly written. If you are into porn it was ok, otherwise forget it. Not for the intelligent reader.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Halloween pushed the boundaries in its' day. True horror, suspense, effects and acting make it a classic to watch not only on October 31st, but any day of the year! Jamie Lee Curtis made her big break while playing the lead role in the movie, and was excellent in her acting. Back then, they didn't need CGI or other crazy computer effects to try and make a movie good. This one was actually a low budget movie, yet was insanely successful. That should tell you something. The plot is a good one, following Michael Myers' unknown plots for murder and revenge. And again, the movie didn't need excessive gore to be popular. It had everything it needed to make it a cult classic! If you're into movies with serial killers, suspense, and edge-of-your-seat action, this movie is for you! You really can't say you're a true fan of horror if this gem isn't in your collection!

Buy it.  Buy it.<br /><br />Congratulations, Mr. Howey.  Well done.

I Couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD and was delighted when I realized I could pre-order The Hunger Games through Amazon and receive it the day it released, I couldn't pass up that great deal. I saved my self time and money driving to the store and waiting in line to get it! The product itself came wrapped and undamaged and it played flawlessly!!!
0425241505|4.0|This was my first book by Thea Harrison and one I really enjoyed reading.<br /><br />There were a lot of things I loved about this book. It's extremely funny. Not only is Dragos so adorably cute but he's naive when it comes to modern things so seeing his reaction to things like Twizzlers and Slurpees was hilarious. Pia is also so sarcastic and sometimes horrified by her sarcasm that I was literally laughing out loud more than once. The book is very fast paced and suspenseful which I really liked. Pia is such a badass heroine that you can't help but like her. Dragos is so dangerous and possessive that you can't help but love the way he manhandles Pia so much.<br /><br />The world is pretty fascinating because there was all different types of mythical creatures like dragons, gryphons, harpies, and thunderbirds. I LOVED reading about them. There's also the different societies and how they're divided into Elder Races like Dark Fae, Elves, Vampires, etc. It's detailed enough on how everything works to satisfy my need for more details but not so detailed that you're overwhelmed by all the information you're given. The secondary characters are just as great as Pia and Dragos were. Tricks and Graydon were some of my favorites because they were funny and compassionate. I can't wait to read their stories.<br /><br />Some things I didn't like about the story, though, is that I was confused a few times (mostly in the beginning). Not only by Pia and her powers but on how some things happened. Aside from that, there was one section that seemed to drag for me. This is because Pia's inner dialogue was a bit too much. She'd go in circles about the same thing so I lost some interest. However, it soon picked up so I was able to get back into the book.<br /><br />Aside from that, I really enjoyed the story. It's entertaining and has so much to it that I was fascinated with all the different shifters, societies and rules. I'm looking forward to the next book.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I have just finished the second book of the trilogy, and I can't wait to start the third book.

B007XUMHQK|5.0|Culture Factory has issued this 24-bit remastered version of Shady Grove, which is the third album by Quicksilver Messenger Service, and which was originally released in December, 1969. Guitarist Gary Duncan had recently quit the group for personal reasons, and this fundamentally altered the sound and dynamics of the band. Rather than recruit another guitarist, and perhaps to leave the door open for Duncan's return (which was imminant), John Cipollina, David Freiberg, and Greg Elmore brought in pianist Nicky Hopkins, and recorded this album.<br /> While I agree with the predominant view that the first two Quicksilver albums represented the band's peak, I am not as dismissive of all subsequent output as many are. It's understandable why Shady Grove was regarded as a disappointment in the context of the time, but taken on it's own terms, it's actually a very good album, which has appreciated with time, and withstood the test of time, better than many of it's contemporary rock era works.<br /> In retrospect, it could be argued that Shady Grove served the same function in the evolution of Quicksilver, that Workingman's Dead served for the Grateful Dead. Like the Dead, Quicksilver was moving away from extended acid-rock jams, to simpler and more concise songs. Though Cipollina was not ready to trade in his Gibson SG for a pedal steel guitar, Shady Grove did have a sound that was more pastoral and introspective, much like the Band or Dylan during the same period. However, Shady Grove still retains overt psychedelia. These guys may have moved to the country, but they were still freaks!<br /> I've always thought that Shady Grove, in particular, would benefit from remastering. The earlier mixes of this album always sounded murky and dull to me, and detracted from the music. This Culture Factory remaster is excellent, with a warm, organic sound, and clear definition. Nicky Hopkins's masterful piano runs sound exquisit. Check out the interplay between Cipollina's guitar and Freiberg's violin on the 3/4 time country waltz, \\"Words Can't Say\\". If you've always been dismissive of this album, you owe it to yourself to hear it the way it was meant to sound, and discover it's wonderful charms!
B0026NWBY2|5.0|When I first ordered this I thought it was a \\"greatest hits\\" but was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was a retrospective collection and a great one at that! It did contain all my favorites and even some I was not familiar with. Regardless, it's a gem of a collection of songs exposing the essence of the man we knew as George Harrison.
0061784788|3.0|James Rollins is a bestselling author, but The Devil Colony was the first of his books I had read. The book is fun to read even though I found the plot to be somewhat farfetched. He writes a good story that moves right along and keeps your attention.<br /><br />Hundreds of mummies are found deep in the Rocky Mountains. Such a discovery clearly draws attention from around the world and controversies inevitably arise. A Native American group lays claim to the bodies and to some gold plates with unusual markings that were also found at the site. People die. Explosions occur and the Sigma Force is called in. The various intelligence agencies squabble.<br /><br />To top things off, a geological catastrophe becomes possible, one that could threaten about half of the United States. Sigma Force has to penetrate a mysterious group that has somehow been manipulating American history for 200+ years. Can our heroes take care of business before legitimate governments come to an end?<br /><br />I am aware that there have been previous Sigma Force novels from Mr. Rollins. It is entirely possible that my review would have been a little higher if I had read those books first rather than starting with The Devil Colony. I suspect that anyone who has enjoyed the earlier books will also enjoy this one.

B005IQZB14|3.0|I got this book because I have really enjoyed reading about hiking, and other people's journeys. That said, I nearly gave up on this book several times. Throughout the book, her ignorance for what she was embarking on annoyed me. I would keep reading, and then it would be more about her having sex with random men, and all of her wildness in her past, and then her remorse for her losses in life. I felt like a good portion of the book really had nothing to do with the PCT.<br /><br />With all of that said...I did enjoy the parts where she actually talks about being on the trail, trail magic, other hikers, etc. I respect the fact that she was also on a personal/spiritual journey while doing the PCT, but some of it really overtook the actual trail and it just turned me off in several sections of the book. It was great that she was honest with experiences over the years, but some just made her come across slutty. I don't think the author actually is that, but based on how frequently she was going on and on about sex, it gave the wrong impression.<br /><br />I also thought the book ended very poorly. One second, she finished the trail and the next instant, she was moving on to her life far after the trail. I didn't mind knowing what happened in her life since, but it just seemed to jump far too quickly.
B008XG1X18|1.0|finally available for kindle fire, but tried so many times it keeps loading and won't be able to login... disappointed...
B0084IG8TM|3.0|No way should this be dragged out for 2 hours and 10 minutes. I squirmed. The entire first hour is slower than cold molasses. Then, after more tedium, we finally get to the games part, but still I did not see the light. My guess is this appeals to the same demographic that is making a hit out of the Twilight books and films, i.e., young semi-educated women. Actually, I found this all rather amusing at many points which I'm sure were unintended. It's a \\"Survivor\\" rip-off, made into a little low-dose science fiction, with some overlay of social commentary about haves and have-nots in conflict. Its insider/outsider conflict reminded me of another recent film that was not much better: \\"Code 46\\" starring Tim Robbins. Ho-hum.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|If you are looking for a fun action movie with great shootouts and fight scenes then this is your movie, the story is pretty simple and doesn't get in the way of the action which is spectacular and plentiful. It is overall a great action packed movie that I enjoyed from start to finish and I wish had a larger theatrical release because it would of done very well.

1609611543|1.0|My wife and I decided that we wanted to try something new to try and loose the belly fat that we had put on over the last 20 years.  Gluten free is the new rave.  Let's give it a shot.  OMG!  I will have to admit that if you follow the plan in this book, you will definately loose weight.  It will require you giving up anything and everything prepared or processed by someone else and I do mean everything.  If you like eating flax seed for breakfast, mushrooms for lunch, and eggplant for dinner, you will love this book.  Did I mention that was all you could eat that day.  It will give you more information about the history of wheat than you ever wanted to know....believe me.  90% of the book is on the evil history of wheat. I'm sure that some people will find this book helpful but it's just too unrealistic for the average person just looking to shed a few pounds.  You will never stick to it.  No magic pill here.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is another entertaining book by Blake Crouch.  As always, his characters are realistic and three dimensional.  The characters also have an appropriate level of suspicion about their surroundings, which is critical for this story to be believable.  This is the first book in the Wayward Pines trilogy.  That trilogy is among my favorite books ever.  I highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed.

B008AVYOBC|5.0|Up until this recent release, the only dvd package of Bananarama's music videos I had in my collection was the November<br />2007 ETV Network Vital Artists disc containing 10 of their videos, including the rare, magnificent \\"Venus\\" extended remix.<br />For years, I (and many others) have hoped and waited for an in-depth, comprehensive dvd presentation of Bananarama's<br />fabulous music videos and now this wonderful release from Rhino beautifully does the job. It contains 35 (!!) of their killer<br />videos (including the 12\\" versions of \\"Venus\\" & \\"I Can't Help It\\"). I am a long-time Bananarama collector, and have most<br />of these in the VHS & laserdisc formats. (After YEARS of looking, I finally located an ultra-rare mint Japanese 8\\" laserdisc<br />of their classic videos \\"And That's Not All\\", along with the equally rare Japanese 8\\" laserdisc \\"Bananarama: Video Singles\\"<br />that has the scarcely seen \\"Do Not Disturb\\"), but this dvd is what I've wanted for the longest time. I only had 10 of their<br />videos from the 80's-90's on old sub-par  VHS tapes - so GREAT to finally have these on magnificent dvd. I'm in pure bliss<br />seeing my favorite girl-group in gorgeous, pristine, perfect quality.  The people who put this collection together have done<br />an incredible job and are to be commended. They've even included Bananarama's most recent videos (\\"Love Comes\\" and<br />\\"Love Don't Live Here\\") from 2009. Would have been marvelous to have seen \\"State I'm In\\", \\"Mr. Sleaze\\", and \\"Waterloo\\"<br />as well, but this is minor.  It's an answered prayer to have the majority of their beautiful pieces in this collection. Bravo!!<br />This package also includes a cd with 22 of their hit singles spanning a broad era of their career, but the CROWN JEWEL is<br />the video collection, all brilliantly remastered & restored.  Long-live Keren, Sara, Siobhan, & Jacquie. The girls have NEVER<br />looked so cool and gorgeous! Keren and Sara have continued on Bananarama as a duo with great success for many years.<br /><br />P.S.  Also, the dvd on this particular release is NTSC region 0, not PAL, as in the<br />amazon description.  It was PAL only about a month ago, but now is in NTSC as<br />in this one available on amazon.particular release is NTSC region 0, not PAL, as in the  amazon description.

B006RED4GA|5.0|Having seen this movie twice now, I'm more than comfortable saying that this is one great horror movie. Upon my first viewing, I wasn't really paying attention and was also drinking as it was probably around 2:00AM. My second watch was far earlier and less drunk. Boy was I surprised. It was chock full of great scares, detailed makeup and an intense 20 minute finale that encompasses a surprisingly good \\"Epilogue\\". Surrounding all of these scares is a fairly tight cast that truely adds to the movie. These quirky characters provide a nice humorous break through the scares and make you actually care whether they live or die. A movie quality I find lacking in a lot of newer movies.<br /><br />So I was a huge fan for one of Ti West's other films, \\"The House of the Devil\\" a great movie in it's own right, but honestly, this one might have surpassed it. Really worth a watch for any supernatural horror fans.
0765316994|5.0|Redshirts was the perfect read this summer. Though I hated to put it down, I could read it in bus-ride-long increments without keeping a chart of characters or plot lines. I found the characters to be believable in their situations, the setting tangible and the wit spot-on. I am an infrequent viewer of Star Trek and similar shows, but I was still able to appreciate Redshirts for its humorous nod at the TV genre.<br /><br />This was my first time reading Scalzi, but certainly won't be the last.
B006QKKICS|3.0|How, you ask, is a plush Vegas hotel like an Eastern European hostel? Easy, it isn't! While the name is the same, this went a bit astray from the norm. It finds our lead characters heading towards Sin City for a wild bachelor party! Obviously having the title \\"Hostel III\\", they run into a bit of trouble. This movie retains all the gore elements that made the first such a crowd pleaser, but it falls behind in story and overall character likeability. This film just lacked in all those overlooked horror details that made the first so great. The language barrier, the lawlessness and uncertainty of foreign countries. Plus the characters are just jerks! You are almost rooting for the killers in this one, as not one of them really makes that attachment to the audience. But, ohh well.<br /><br />So, this isn't awful, and if you were searching for a Hostel sequel. This is unfortunately it. But it really isn't horrible and is exactly what is described in the movie summary.  So you will know what to expect, a not nearly as good remake of the first and second Hostel that is set in Vegas. So enjoy!

1439110123|4.0|\\"The Prize\\" is a history of oil from the initial 1859 discovery of petroleum in Pennsylvania to the present day.  Yet there is so much more here than \\"oil\\".<br /><br />\\"The Prize\\" is moreover, a virtual chronicle of the World during that span-especially the 20th century after World War I.  Military history is key: Shortages of petroleum drastically hampered Japan and Germany and hastened the end of hostilities in WWII.  This reader already knew that but author Yergin drove the point home anew. He was not aware of Japan's crucial failure to destroy oil depots during the attack on Pearl Harbor. And all of Germany's vast iron and coal deposits were of little value in the end.  Yergin is very adept at waving military annals into his story.<br /><br />It seems impossible to imagine now, but during WW2 the United States supplied 80% of the Allied powers oil and 67% of the World's needs. Tempus fugit.<br /><br />This reader's favorite section was the Suez Canal crisis of 1956.  Egypt seized the strategic waterway and President Eisenhower declined to intervene. That episode marked the passing of England as a great power.  Writing of then Prime Minister Anthony Eden, the Times of London stated that \\"he was the last Prime Minister to believe that Great Britain was still a great power and the first to realize it was not\\".<br /><br />\\"The Prize\\" duly outlines an incredible amount of wheeling, dealing, back stabbing and double dealing plus the rise and fall of some Great Powers. All is supported by 94 pages of end notes.  Everything is documented: Yergin has done his homework. The one weakness here is the length.  That proverbial stern editor with a sharp blue pencil could have been hired to thin out the text. (Do publishers employ folks like that any more?).  Still, the final call here is positive! \\"The Prize\\" could have been a ponderous tome.  Instead Yergin has produced a highly readable historical novel on a most serious subject.  Well done!

B003W16T9K|5.0|I have not heard an entirely unexceptionable  complete Schubert symphony set, including those by Bohm,Sawallisch, and Abbado. I do consider Eugen Jochum's one half set-#s 4/Tahra,5/DG, 8/Tahra, and 9/DG- to be five star versions unreservedly and would rank none of them below those of the  completists et al.  Abbado benefits from updated scholarship, excellent sound, and mostly good tempi from the fine COE (the small size helps in #s 1-6 especially.) I do find the opening of #5 a bit too quick and some of #4 too sedate c.f. Jochum and Sawallisch (the Sawallisch #4/1 is too quick, however).  Abbado's #9 is very good- as large scaled as it deserves, rythmically alert,unstintingly tough and tender. #s 1-3  and #6 (especially tne more Rossiniesque #6) fare best. And #5 is fine after its hasty introduction.<br /><br />Rankings for the other three sets in descending order<br />  #1-Sawallisch, Abbado, Bohm<br />  #2- Abbado, Sawallisch, Bohm<br />  #3- Bohm, Sawallisch, Abbado<br />  #4-Sawallisch, Abbado, Bohm<br />  #5-Bohm, Abbado, Sawallisch<br />  #6- Abbado, Sawallisch, Bohm<br />  #8 and 9- Sawallisch, Abbado, Bohm<br /><br />Best of the rest:<br />Ristenpart 1 and 2; Marriner 1 and 4; William Steinberg 2, 8 and 9; Munch 2 and 8; Carlos Kleiber 3 and 8; Van Beinum 3,6, and 8; Neumann 3 and 8; Klemperer 5,8, and 9; Reiner 8; Szell 8 and 9; Erich Kleiber 9; Haitink 5 and 9 9; Boult 9

030758836X|4.0|I bought this book for double the Amazon price at a high-end locally owned bookstore... And I don't regret it. So at this price, GO FOR IT. By the end of it you'll probably hate every character like I did... but it was definitely a page turner. STOP READING REVIEWS and DON'T PEEK AHEAD while you read it! Enjoy!
030758836X|3.0|Deep into \\"Gone Girl\\", I congratulated myself for purchasing such a great novel; I could not put it down.  The writing was terrific, the plot \\"on-the-edge-of-your-seat\\", the proverbial Page Turner.  I wanted copies for my reader friends!  Three-quarters through, the story loses all plausibility; the ending astonishingly unsatisfying.  Too bad.  There were so many directions this story could have taken; in the end, it wimped out.

1476712042|5.0|I have no idea what to say about this book.  I have no idea how to start this review.<br />I first realized that this book could be something special after getting more than one email in my inbox letting me know that in effect I had to drop everything and read this book from an author I have never heard of.  Now, I get quite a lot of emails for books to read but something about this one had the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end, and had my gut telling me in no uncertain terms that I had to literally drop everything...meaning the two books I was in the middle of and had a deadline for reviewing...and read this one.<br />I always listen to my gut.  Yes, sometimes I procrastinate; I hem and haw until I finish the books I have to read.  But not this time.  The last time I got this feeling for a book was for Sylvia Day's Bared to You, so I knew I had to read it.  And like Day's book I completely missed my bedtime and in fact missed my waking up time to, I was certainly draggin the next day.  Make that the morning of the day that I happily and sadly finished the book.<br />Abby Abernathy is your typical college freshman with a dark past.  Travis Maddox is your typical bad boy who all the girls love but he only has eyes for one.<br />Beautiful Disaster to me was a younger version of Bared to You.  I just could not get over the similarities of both.  I laughed, I cried, and was thrown for a loop by the beautiful writing.  I just love how an author can make you a part of their world with their rich description and depth of emotion that they pull out of you when you finish the last page.<br />I'm eagerly waiting for the sequel, Walking Disaster coming next year.  NEXT YEAR!!  *sigh* Yeah.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|At the beginning, I thought the story was a bit slow, but around page 200, it started to get better. I had never read a  Stephen King book before, because I had the idea that he wrote only horror stories. No horror in this one. A romance evolves around the middle of the book. I most definitely did not expect that. It was one of the things I enjoyed the most. It was hard to put the book down from page 715 up to the end. I think the ending was pretty good, maybe not the best, but enjoyable.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This is not a movie/dvd to be judged by action or possible reality.  It is as true to the book as any 2 hour plus movie could hope to be.  It delivered the soul of the book.  The young actors are true to their characters and portray them with heart and realism.  This also holds true to all the veterans as well.  All actors were perfect choices, especially, Katmiss, Peeta, and Harnish.  I would recomment this 100%.  By the way,I am a 64 year old grandmother of 8 and would take any of them to this movie.  They show young ladies and men not only as heros, but the 'old-fashioned' ideas of family and honor. ++++++

B008BM9L72|3.0|It's weird how extreme peoples' opinions of this series are. They either love it or hate it, there's no in between. Me, I'm not sure how I feel about this series. The characters are one dimensional archetypes, not fleshed out enough to be properly believable. I get that people change and Christian's personality is \\"mercurial\\" (a word that features often in this series) but he has a complete 180 degree turnaround in his personality in just three months. Yes, I get he falls in love but really? Anastasia is supposed to be super intelligent but comes across as being a whiny little girl, whose whole sense of self worth is wrapped up in pleasing her man. They both suffer from personality disorders and low self esteem, constantly questioning whether one is good enough for the other. Characters come and go in this series for no particular reason and there are a lot of scenes which are just filler, in order to pad out the word length and as a result, become extremely tedious to read. Never mind the poor editing, the repetitious use of words, sentences, scenes which all blend into each other because they are all so similar and most irritatingly so, the bizarre inner dialogue Anastasia has with her \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconcious\\" as if they are actual characters! WTF!?<br /><br />The sex scenes are fine at first (not as kinky as you'd think) but after a while become annoying. Anastasia is one lucky girl. She has orgasms around the clock and Christian is a man's wet dream; like a teenage boy he has a constant hard on, especially after having ejaculated for the millionth time. All these two do is have sex. I'm surprised Christian has time to run an empire and how the hell does Anastasia become the chief editor of a publishing firm? Oh, right, her boyfriend buys the bloody company! Sorry, I'm ranting but these books really got my goat! And I really wanted to like them!<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is the worst of the three; there is no plot, just sex scene after sex scene. Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed are a little better and at least make an attempt to tell a story. I agree with others when they said that the three books could have been pared down to one (which would have made for a tighter, more cohesive story but obviously money is more important than literature) and some of the language and euphemisms used are a little odd. Since the story is set in the US, why do the characters use terms that only people from the UK would use?<br /><br />Christian's back story is fairly cliched as well. I get he was modeled after Twilight's Edward Cullen and since he is human and not a vampire, he obviously needs a \\"dark side\\" in order to make him emotionally vulnerable but how many times do we need the abused child story line? Romanticizing his revolting relationship with Elena Lincoln (aka Mrs. Robinson) is a worry as well. Would we be this forgiving if the genders were reversed? No, we wouldn't!<br /><br />I'm still baffled as to why these books are as popular as they are. Fantasy is fine but when women and teenage girls start fantasizing about getting their very own Christian Grey, we need to look at why that is. Which begs the question: does an alpha male (which Christian Grey supposedly is) mean that a man must be an emotionally abusive control freak as well?
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Love this book! It exceeded my expectations. You will laugh OUT LOUD while you are reading this! Even if you only have 5 minutes during the day to turn on your kindle and read or open your book, it will be worth it.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Well written, a great easy read, not as erotic as the media billed it, I found it interesting and entertaining, mind you this review is written by a middle aged happily married woman who has had a reasonably traditional sex life, but when discussing the book with the 20+ (age) girls at work, they certainly found it much more challenging than me, so maybe it could be better targeted to an older age demographic.  Suggest you read it yourself and make your own decision, I for one, was certainly not disappointed with my purchase.

Songs like Elvis Presley's \\"Hound Dog\\" and Johnny Cash's \\"I Walk The Line\\" and ends up with selections like Cat Stevens' \\"Wild World\\".<br /><br />He gives you strumming patterns, chord shapes and many things I hadn't learned trying to play by ear. He even gives you tabulature.<br /><br />As others have said, I would have liked it to have been spiral bound.
B005LAIIQC|1.0|No points for originality, everything here is a repeat, the search for medication replaces the search for identity; everything else is a repeat( should I repeat that?) .  There's an even more deadly version of TREADSTONE, call ALUR (or something), then there's an even more deadly version of that called LOAX (or something).  The people in charge of ALUR didn't know that LOAX was operational (surprise!).  The story is so old, that by the time LOAX 3 becomes operational, we don't even get introduced to his mind-problems, he just does his roof-jumping,motor-biking thing without any sympathy of any kind.  OMG.<br />Edward Norton is very good, very menacing without having to leave his office/data centre.  Poor old Rachel Weiz, even though she is a very clever doctor, gets to sit in the passenger seat of cars and wince and scream, like all the other Bourne-girlfriends.  She gets to administer medicine, mop furrowed brows, not fall off motor-bikes, and scream for help.  Why can't she be empowered, a-la Catwoman? The Bourne-type character is ok, but suffers from not really being Bourne (Could Bourne be Bourne, with such a plot?  I think its very intelligent of Matt Demon to stay away from this; perhaps he should only return if there's a plot-twist in the next movie, e.g. Jason Bourne becomes a celebrity-chef, and poisons bad guys, or fights obesity or something).<br />So the basic point here is, you have seen this movie before with better actors (except Norton). Why make this again?<br />Why not change he plot a bit?
B00006DEF9|5.0|Betty Comden and Adolph Green created this movie idea and script just from the title tune, which originated in the film The Hollywood Revue of 1929. This was not the only song composed by Nacio Herb Brown (tunes) and Arthur Freed (lyrics) taken from earlier films, but there were also two numbers composed for the film by Roger Edens to which Comden and Green added lyrics. Freed also produced the movie for MGM.<br /><br />The storyline concerns the struggle some stars had in getting used to `talkies' after acting in silent films - here, with hilarious results. The star of the film is Gene Kelly (as actor Don Lockwood) who romances Debbie Reynolds (playing chorus girl Kathy Selden) with competing love interest provided by Donald O'Connor. The singing and dancing are first-rate with many well-known tunes: `You were meant for me', `You are my lucky star', `Would you', Beautiful girl' and others. Add in all the humour and you have a really entertaining film. It may be a clich&eacute; but, oh, how true: they don't make them like this anymore. Kelly's dancing of the title song has of course become a classic piece of cinema.

B000H6SXLU|4.0|Roberta was a musical on the Broadway stage in 1933. Our heroine (played by Helen Westley) doesn't last long in this film, released in 1935. She seems to be on the point of expiring when the film opens and the rather far-fetched plot is all about what happens when her haute couture salon in Paris passes to her nephew (played by Randolf Scott), who is an all-American football star. Not the most convincing of plots - actually based on a book called Gowns by Roberta by Alice Duer Miller - but it served its purpose as a vehicle for a ravishing score by Jerome Kern with lyrics by Otto Harbach. The same story set entirely in Paris was remade rather more convincingly in colour by MGM in 1952 as Lovely To Look At. Astaire was partnered here by Ginger Rogers in their third film together.<br /><br />The songs soon became popular standards and, together with the Astaire-Rogers dancing, helped the film along. They included `Let's begin', `I'll be hard to handle', `You're devastating,' `Lovely to look at', `Smoke gets in your eyes' (sung in the film by Irene Dunne), and `I won't dance', originally from a London-based show by Kern and Oscar Hammerstein but reworked here with new lyrics by Dorothy Fields. Randolph Scott, before his career in westerns, has a quite prominent role as a footballer friend of Astaire's.<br /><br />The film is in black-and-white of course, given its age, but Astaire and Rogers look good together whether or not they are in colour.

B004811PMO|4.0|This was the first collaboration between Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein after the death of Rodgers' previous song-writing partner, Lorenz Hart. Hammerstein also wrote the original book on which the screen-play was based. The show, which won the 1944 Pulitzer Prize, opened on Broadway on 31 March 1943 and the film followed in 1955. The show and film were more serious than the frivolous Viennese operetta or joined-up vaudeville type musicals that preceded it. Instead of a contemporary theme, the story was set in Oklahoma Territory in the early 1900s.<br /><br />The central love story revolves around ranch-hand Curly (Gordon Macrae) and Laurey (Shirley Jones), daughter of a pioneer farmer. There are fine performances from the supporting cast of Gene Nelson, Gloria Grahame, Eddie Albert, James Whitmore and Rod Steiger (as Jud Fry, who tries to break up the romance). So many of the songs have remained in the popular repertoire for more than 60 years: `Oh what a beautiful morning', `Surrey with the fringe on top', `Out of my dreams' (presented as a fine ballet sequence), `People will say we're in love' and, of course, `Oklahoma'. There are lots more tunes that need to be seen and heard in context. Great entertainment for over two hours.
B007STBUIW|5.0|I was blown away by the Blu-ray!!  It is absolutely beautiful.  The picture is so fresh and clean.  The sound is phenominal. And the extras are as interesting as the movie, itself!  It's a MUST for Blu-ray owners!!
B000059GEI|5.0|With a host of stars and a score by Irving Berlin, we're off to a good start for this 1954 film from Twentieth Century Fox. Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey play a couple of vaudeville stars, the Donahues. Their offspring join them in the act when young, but the film is about what happens when they grow up and start out on careers of their own. Johnny Ray, in his only film role, decides to go into the priesthood, which is a bit of a shock for mum and dad. Donald O'Connor has a bit of a battle with alcohol but still manages to dance up a storm in `A man chases a girl'. His paramour is a showgirl played by Marilyn Monroe, who gives a scorching version of `Heat wave', proving that she can both sing and dance as well as look sexy. In `Lazy' she is joined by O'Connor and Mitzi Gaynor, who is the least troubled or troublesome of the Donahue children. Other Berlin numbers, besides the title song, include `A pretty girl is like a melody' (the Donahue parents), `Alexander's ragtime band' and `When the midnight choo-choo leaves for Alabam' (sung by the whole family), `If you believe' (Johnny Ray's solo piece), `Remember' and other numbers. A veritable feast of entertainment for nearly 120 minutes.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|For kinky porn, it's ok. I'm not into pain, whips, devices and dark secrets, but I am a writer. The first book was \\"educational\\"and the writing repetitive and riding on shock value...but what kept me reading was wanting to know where this author was headed. I wasn't disappointed with her development as a writer and the ability to take her reader (me) to neutral ground. I was intrigued why her main character stayed in the picture...I'm afraid I identified with Kate Kavanaugh end of story. Interesting read. I quit after the second book, but may pick up the third later in a moment of curiosity.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This novel was very intriguing.  It kept my attention and my desire to want to read more.  The best book I've read in a long time.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's  been cool just playing on there I want to make it better how can I . super fun stuff
0061714402|5.0|This book was very interesting. Alot of good personal stories kept me reading until I was done. If your a fan of rock star bio's this is one of the better ones.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love this app! great quality sounds. i would recommend this app to anyone. from moms with babies...to adults needing some down time.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|The only thing this app is good for is seeing how much battery u have. All that crap about how many hours u have to go on the Internet, and to watch videos, and to listen to ur music is dumb. I mean seriously, 108 hrs to watch videos? SERIOUSLY!
B008E374PO|5.0|And all of a sudden we have a new Owl City album to revel in.<br /><br />So first of all, let me make it clear that 1. Yes, I am an Owl City fan but 2. I don't have a crush on Adam Young. I respect him too much to do that to him. I do however think he's a positive, humble guy who admits frequently that not everyone is going to like Owl City, and that Owl City is not going to last forever. How fresh and rare! I respect him even more because his claims for being a Christian is backed up by his life style. He's not playing the hypocrite. At all.<br /><br />And do keep in mind, I'm not aiming this review at any other review. I'm simply talking here :)<br /><br />So no, I'm not a silly fan-girl; but do I love everything that comes out of Adam's music collection? Yes I do. And it's not that I do it to be a part of a 'thing.' Actually where I come from, most of my friends poke a lot of fun at Adam's 'silly, senseless' lyrics and electronic 'auto-tone voice'. Owl City is actually the only band I dig-- besides owning everything from Enya and every soundtrack I can possibly get a hold of. Owl City is the only band I actually enjoy listening to. And I have sentimental, real reasons for it. I might enjoy one or two songs from here and there.<br /><br />And personally, while I can't stand much of Taylor Swift's style; I don't critize her as a person. She seems like a very nice person to be honest; but her music doesn't appeal to me, and I can't understand much of what she's trying to say either. Her messages don't make sense to me-- not the way Adam's does.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I'm weird; or maybe it's because I write fantasy stories-- but Adam's work REALLY speaks to me, in ways that I can't describe.<br /><br />Let me be honest, I discovered Owl City via Macy's intercom 2 years ago when they played 'Fireflies'. Until then, I hated 'pop' music (except Enya) and was prejudice against ANYTHING electronic, rock or pop. I tuned that sort of music out-- but how could I when suddenly I'm hearing chimes? And when a guy is sining about fireflies, hugs, and so many beautiful enchanting things? I was swept off my feet. And instead of discovering an artist where I only liked one or two tracks from each album (which is typical with me-- (i.e. Skillet, 10th Avenue North, Celtic Woman, Taylor Swift etc.) I fell in love with every single track that existed from Maybe I'm Dreaming to Of June.<br /><br />Owl City came at a time when my siblings and I were hurting emotionally-- and the only happy times we had was when we were together, just us three, in the car, driving back and forth places, listening to Owl City. Owl City was there for us in a really deep and personal way. We associate those songs with each other, and the 'Good Time's we've had with each other. Taking away Owl City would be crippling for us. Not that we couldn't live without it, but it's taking away a whole sluth of dear, priceless memories. We identified with Owl City...<br /><br />And now, every time he releases a new album, between us three-- it's an amazing sense of wonder, excitment and 'oh... my... GOSH! PARTY TIME!' We squeal and scream.<br /><br />So... now all that remains is the big question? Do I like The Midsummer Station?<br /><br />To be honest. Yes. With all my heart. Unfortunately, for me, there's no 'in-between' ground. I'm the kind of girl who gets accused of being too loyal to friends or 'obsessed' with my fandoms (because I'm picky and have only three The Lord of the Rings, Owl City, and How to Train Your Dragon). While all my other friends come and go with 'fandoms' I spend time with them... and park myself in those fandoms. Thus people think I'm obsessive, when I'm just more loyal and less fad-driven; and have sentimental value tied up in what I like.<br /><br />It's new for me to be able to have a band that I love and being able to wait for new albums. To me, it's exciting and new!<br /><br />But even then, The Midsummer Station was really the soundtrack of my summer. I have never but only had one crush in my whole life; and I knew he liked me back too. I moved, and now he doesn't talk to me at all. He refuses... I identify with things like 'Take it All Away' because it hurts; and somehow it's like Adam understands that a lost love tears you up. That loving really subjects yourself to wearing your heart on your sleeve. I can't say how many times I've listened to that track, sitting there on the bed wondering what I did wrong-- hoping someday it'll feel okay.<br /><br />There's Dreams and Disasters-- which keeps me giggling: 'we had to laugh, as the smoke billowed higher'-- again, this is completely me and my siblings. We've had our backyard catch on fire before. &lt;3 GOOD TIMES!<br /><br />Or Gold-- which is very little main stream since the lyrics have all to do with wishing the subject the best in life-- and is directed towards someone else instead of self. How poignant and selfless and content to wish all that of someone you love (whether friend, or lover) instead of saying it about yourself; Adam's selfless attitude shows and distinguishes him from mainstream.<br /><br />Shooting Star? of course! Beautiful! This song has it's roots deeply tied into Christian themes of being a light in the dark.<br /><br />Ember speaks of never giving up, even when it's hard. That's not mainstream; mainstream would be giving into the despair, wallowing in black selfpity. Adam encourages us to pick back up and climb higher. He knows it gets better; and it does.<br /><br />Sillhouette-- this one hurts... it hurts because it's been my summer all over with my crush. I've only ever fallen for one guy; and it's hard to feel again. You don't want to move one; but you have to. It hurts being alone, even when you try so hard not to be alone. I'm a rainbow chaser-- I get made fun of. And somedays there's no helping the pain.<br /><br />Good Time-- very fun! Very unique! It's a promise that, even IF things are going to be bad and mess up, we can STILL have a fun, fantastic time-- and we don't need beer or drugs to have it. We can have simple innocent fun and it'll STILL be a good time! This lively song is a good motivation for going to work. I know because I play it going back and forth!<br /><br />And is everyone going to agree with this? No. They don't have to. It's their own unique taste.<br /><br />But for myself, I do like this new album. i'm thrilled. I don't think it's mainstream-- just because Adam tries a new style. It's not the style that dictates whether or not a song is mainstream-- but lyrics. The lyrics kill or make the song.<br /><br />Taylor Swift is mainstream, but she can do no wrong. Electronica *is* a mainstream style, and Owl City hasn't lost the electronic feel-- he's just dressed it up with a dance beat. And he has every right to. If he doesn't enjoy what he writes, he won't pour his heart and soul in it; and THAT wouldn't be Owl City. Owl City is all about pouring every bit of your heart into what you do-- it's about being opptimistic. Adam has even stated that the point and purpose of Owl City is opptimism: finding hope, and trying to be happy-- even with the hard knocks you get. Being opptimistic is a fight. It's not easy. It's trying so hard to feel okay with all the pain you get.<br /><br />And while others have every right to not like Owl City-- just remember, if Owl City kept it's old style completely, people would accuse him of 'recycling' everything and having no new material. Now he's experimenting; and he has the right to do it. He doesn't expect to be popular for ever; he's not doing it for money or to be 'mainstream'. Why would he try to be mainstream? He already had a wide, huge audience.<br /><br />He did it because he enjoys it. And as an artist, he does have that right to express himself musically in that way. Just like you have the right to take or leave what Adam gives to us.<br /><br />Maybe my point might be, even if you don't like the new songs and style--at least be considerate to Adam: he is a great guy, who tries really hard. I'm an artist and a book writer-- it's NOT easy subjecting your work to people to be critized-- and I do get hurtful feedback sometimes. Becausae it's a part of your heart-- a piece of work that you dumbed everything into-- your soul, your heart-- your passion, your hurt and your hopes. Adam does the same thing; and he's human just like we are. As consumers, maybe we could consider that he has real feelings too-- and even if we don't like what Adam writes/sings/says/believes maybe we could be kind? He doesn't have to share this with us; but he does. I'm grateful he does. I'm sure he hurts sometimes when people say nasty mean things. The fact is, we all hurt when people say mean things about something we all tried. I don't expect anyone to love Owl City-- and GOOD helpful critism is GOOD and helpful. It helps artists grow, let's just keep in mind though that this guy has feelings, and maybe we could be nice about it.<br /><br />No, this isn't some 'gushy' Christian philosophy-- most of my Christian friends would disagree with me.<br /><br />And yup, we all have freedom of speech! HURRAY FOR THAT! THAT is the beauty of America; we still have that right, and let's pray we have that right for years to come!<br /><br />It's YOUR right to dislike or love music or anything else; it's my right to love Owl City; it's Adam's right to write the sort of music he enjoys :) We're all unique, individually made people; we wouldn't be that without our tinsy quirks.<br /><br />Adam expresses it through his music; he hasn't given up the electronic sound. He's given us an ELECTRONIC dance beat. Shooting Star has little dance rhythm. I'm Coming After You very much resounds of Ocean Eyes.<br /><br />And I know this singer like the back of my hand; i've listened to his albums 100+ times. So I know what Owl City is :D It's the test of any artist (music or otherwise) to try and SELL to his audience. 1. he has to sell to a new audience (and he's already won over a new fan, who previously disliked his material) 2. he has to sell to previous fans (whehter hardcore or softcore) And he's definately sold to me. This is probably one of my favourite albums that he's given us. I love the others-- but this-- this has all the old Owl City flavour and magic. He's lost none of his innocent, quirky lyrics-- none of his sense of humour or play on words!<br /><br />It's not mainstream at all to compare romance to police chases, but it's adoreable.<br /><br />The fact is every musical style out there IS mainstream. Nothing is completely original. I've had a professional author tell me this in a writing course I took: it's OUR job to make OUR material NEW and EXCITING... not to sit there and think of something COMPLETELY new and COMPLETELY original. Becaue we'll never get it. Every story revolves around one... Cinderella and happily ever after.'<br /><br />And the same is true for music. Just like Taylor Swift marked her place in Country-- just like Taylor Swift is giving way to a 'pop' sound (i.e. We Are Never Ever Going to Get Back Together), Adam is experimenting with new material. And he has that right! Mainstream can be judged, however, by lyrics-- and Adam's lyrics are far from mainstream. It's the lyrics that matter in a song-- and the message; at least, I never like a song unless the lyrics move me. There's been countless songs that have amazing tunes, but I can't stand because of poor lyrics (i.e. Better Than Revenge). So maybe I go too deep-- but the lyrics is what makes or breaks a song as far as mainstream goes, as far as 'message' goes. And Adam hasn't lost any of his magical, amazing touch. It's still there. He's giving us more; and I'm eager for more.<br /><br />It's all I want just to meet him and shake his hand one day and say thanks; because he really did make a difference. I'll always have a fan, even if everyone else hates what he does.<br /><br />I'm not bashing anyone. I'mnot saying you HAVE to like what he does. That's your right. It makes you... YOU. But it's Adam's right to write what he enjoys best; not everyone is ever going to be completely happy. Adam knows this. He's not trying to be mainstream; he has no reason to be mainstream. He won us over before; he knows he doesn't need it. He knows Owl City won't always be No.1 on the charts.<br /><br />And if I seem overly dramatic about this, it's only because Owl City means so much to me as an individual; he was opptimistic and happy when I wanted to give up, despair, and die. He makes me laugh, or extremely happy when I was previously crying. He moves me, and that, for me, is what really proves whether the material in a new album is worth while, or mainstream. I care about the guy; I feel like I know him. I just want him to be happy in life, because golly-- he deserves it. He's made such a difference in my life in so many ways. It proves Owl City hasn't failed, and will never fail, even if its placing in the iTunes charts slips away. The charts don't prove or make a song, album, artist... it's whether or not that artist ever made a difference in anyone's life. And Adam has.<br /><br />This isn't a critical judgement on ANYONE. I haven't that right to bash anyone. That would be cruel, mean and arrogant of me. I'm simply trying to be loyal to my fandom. Because Adam is a real person with real feelings, and it HAS to be hard to sell to people like us.<br /><br />Thank you, Adam. You really are an amazinig guy-- and no matter what, I'll always be your devoted fan. I hope you know how much your work means to me, and what this newest album especially means to me. You're one of a kind. You really are gold! So shine forever and never give up! I'll always have your back.least be considerate to Adam: he is a great guy, who tries really hard.

B007KOYEOC|4.0|3rd book of series - easy reading and great book - loved it! Just wish there was another book to follow
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I love watching this dvd.  A very good animated comedy. ( adventures of a cute blue parrot) I just received my second \\"Rio\\" dvd from Amazon, and will be sending it to my granddaughter and her husband. When it played at the cinema, my granddaughter derived much enjoyment in watching this movie.  Great colorful entertainment for the entire family!
014241039X|5.0|I love this book, in spite of the fact that by now I have outgrown it. Roald Dahl is an extraordinary author, and many of his books have been hailed as classics, and with good reason too. And they are not just the typical classics, either, which children are usually reluctant to pick up due to their historical timeline and seemingly uninteresting premises. Roald Dahl's books are fascinating and enchanting, with fun plots and plenty of humor. This book revolves around a revolting couple, the Twits, who like to play practical jokes and detest everything around them in a comical fashion, albeit their pet monkeys seek vengeance on them for incarcerating them in a cage and forcing them to remain upside-down perpetually. I once wrote an oral report on this book, and I could barely contain my laughter to read it. Some of my classmates were laughing along as well, and it's enjoyably repulsive and fun. I do not see why anyone could possibly dislike it, and I definitely would recommend it to you.
B0053Q9DHW|1.0|This \\"Jane Eyre\\" movie was not to my liking at all.  The actors were ho-hum boring.  ( reciting their lines with no emotion.) The scenes, etc. was terrible.  My all time favorite \\"Jane Eyre\\" dvd's are--- (1) \\"Jane Eyre\\" starring Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine---(2) \\"Jane Eyre\\" starring George C. Scott and Susannah York.  Great Actors.
030758836X|2.0|My husband started reading this aloud to me on a road trip.  We both were into it.  However, the last 1/3 of the book seems totally off ... too bizarre, and the end left me SUPER disappointed.<br /><br />The writing style was good, but the plot turned out disappointing, especially the last chapter or two.  My husband hasn't finished it yet, and isn't even at the major plot twist, but I can't imagine he'll like it all too much either.  I can't decide if I should recommend he finish it or move onto a different book.

1466401885|4.0|Abby Abernathy is a good character she is grounded and pure until she meets Travis Maddox, the story like is good and I could see this happening at any college campus.  It is a good story line.

034580404X|5.0|I purchased the Fifty Shades Trilogy so that I would have my own boxed set copy.  I had previously purchased the three books individually.  They are right now out in the community for everyone to enjoy.  Fifty Shades is a love story that show that with compromise, understanding, and strength. I encourage everyone to read this. It has renewed my own marriage.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works much better than Logmein. It's more intuitive and easier to operate. It also seems to be speedier and it's less expensive.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|I saw the HBO special and couldn't wait for the DVD to come out.  I could watch it a thousand times.  The price was great and I bought one for my sister too. If you are a Beatles fan, you MUST have this DVD.
B0086700CM|5.0|I first I thought that I would not like it but then my friend got and I Tryed it and liked it so I got it
B000SEGQNS|3.0|Its a good book, written well but is getting outdated with the changes happening all around in the internet space. With mobile internet gaining momentum, the  book is still stuck with early 2000 examples and solutions.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|its like skyrim and world of warcraft mixed I love my sharman hes so awesome I have to do a update but after that I can play again
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was greatly disappointed in this book. It was a new version of the old Romance Novel and poorly written.  The main Character (Grey) turned me off so i could never identify with his character.  I have never found handsome, tall, rich men to be exciting or sexy.  This determination I made beginning in my Junior Year in College. My assessment of this type of men  has continued to be reinforced today. Usually this type of male is ego-centric and seems to become more so as he gets older.  Fifty Shades of Grey does not compare with the Swedish Trilogy beginning with the Girl With the Dragon Tatoo.  Fifty Shades of Grey is too predictable; the only good thing was the ending.  I will definitely not read any more books by this author.

B005I4JG80|5.0|My husband and I are expecting our first child and my sister had recommended, \\"Bringing Up Bebe\\" to us.  I read the book with no expectations and ended up being enlightened on the eating habits of Americans and the French.<br /><br />Pamela Druckerman's creative writing makes the subject even more interesting.  I felt myself reflecting on my own eating habits and what plan we will have for our family, once our child arrives.<br /><br />She utilizes facts successfully and offers a different perspective of introducing food to children.<br /><br />Druckerman's observation of the French society's way of raising children is definitely one that initiates dialogue - and is an interesting view.  I am now encouraging my husband to read the book so that we can decide what will be best for our family.  I enjoyed reading the book and encourage others to read it as well.  It will make you take a look at your own eating habits and may even have you re-evaluate how you introduce food to your children.

B006LSZECO|5.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" by Gillian Flynn is a very well written book.  Flynn leaves the reader wondering what will happen next the entire time.  She does a great job with details throughout the book.  Flynn develops the characters along the way, all of which are very dynamic.  This book is an excellent read - I would highly recommend it to my friends.
0345803493|5.0|I've heard several conversations from women who were reading the books but I wasn't really interested, as reading wasn't one of my favorite past times.  But when my daughter told me that she read first book and was on the second, I thought...what the heck!  I started reading the first book and I could not put it down!  I would finish one chapter and kept WANTING...more!

B004UID2LC|5.0|This app was a 5 star app before the update I finally installed today. I regret updating, now I just hope for another update that will fix it. I am unable to play the mp3 or any other type of file once it \\"downloads\\" but when I look at the file, it is 0 bytes so it looks like nothing is actually downloading in the first place.<br /><br />***Update 4/12/2013***<br /><br />Yes, this app has had some trouble in the past. I bet it is because YouTube is likely trying to keep people from downloading other people's content that was meant for STREAMING. The devs for this have caught up and the latest update works! I just downloaded a hilarious KMart commercial with no problem. This app is great for pulling sound clips from viral videos to be used as notifications/ringers etc!<br /><br />Also, HEY DUMMIES, READ THE DESCRIPTION OF THE APP BEFORE YOU RATE IT POORLY BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO VIEW A YOUTUBE VIDEO. I use this app as a means to DOWNLOAD a video I have already watched on YouTube. This is a TOOL, not a primary source of entertainment. You definitely CAN view videos but it makes more sense to watch the video elsewhere and then find it with this app to download it.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|While an overwhelming feeling of sadness is the ultimate result of watching this well produced film,  a sense of outrage is nearly as great.  Not only was Senna treated very unfairly by the F1 powers in large part because he was not European, the Williams team knew well that their revised car was very unbalanced and essentially a deathtrap.  What is not mentioned in the film are the criminal charges brought against the Williams team as a result of the crash.<br /><br />While never \\"officially\\" proven, the crash that killed Senna likely occured when the steering column broke.  The Williams team had moved the steering column on Senna's request but did a very poor welding job and there was much evidence it fractured prior to the crash which explains why there was no steering correction applied before impact.  Why this part was left out by the film makers can only be explained by the fact that they were British and the Williams team was British.  Many think that Frank Williams was essentially responsible for Senna's death.<br /><br />I would have hoped for better archival footage both in camera and out from his later years but their is nothing remotely HD about this film.  It is a powerful movie in laying out what we know is inevitable.  It is only too bad that it does not tell the whole story.  BTW,  Alain Prost, who was largely and understandably to some degree, vilified in the film, was invited to the funeral and continues to be a trustee of the Senna foundation.<br /><br />A very good movie that could have been a great movie.  You should by all means see it and then research what was not included for yourself.
B0061Q13V2|4.0|\\"Off Balance\\" is a worthwhile read.  Unfortunately, it paints a less than flattering picture of the state of U.S. gymnastics and the pressure exerted on some athletes from a very young age to be the best.  The descriptions of Bela and Marta Karolyi's training and coaching techniques are disturbing, although not unbelievable.<br /><br />More than just about Dominique's Olypmic experiences, the book carefully tells the story of the lifetime of a young girl destined for world greatness and how she comes to learn she has a sister she never knew.<br /><br />Regarding the book, itself, the writing is good.  It is a quick read, but it is full of details (and not all of them are flattering things to put in print).  If I have one criticism, it is that the book interlaces past with present in awkward spurts.  Several chapters are devoted to the past, and the next brings the reader into the present and how Dominique's sister, Jennifer, comes into her life.  Then, we're back in the past.  This is probably more of a personal preference to me and in no way diminishes the content of the book.  However, it seems to disrupt the flow of the story in some areas.<br /><br />Also, it was nice to include photographs at the end (at least they're at the end in the Kindle edition).  It makes the book come alive when one can put a face to a name.  The photograph selection was well-done and relevant to the entire work.<br /><br />I recommend this book, especially if you're a gymnastics or Olympics fan.  You will be taken back to those incredible Magnificent Seven moments in Atlanta 1996.  You find out just what was happening, and you'll learn how that monumental accomplishment of winning team gold has a whole other behind-the-scenes story - one you may not like or think possible.
1416550550|4.0|Kate Morton tells wonderful stories. The Forgotten Garden is sort of a mystery, but not one that strains the reader to solve. The narrative is broken into three parts that are interwoven throughout the book, and those are not necessarily in a traditional chronological order themselves. The structure may make the story difficult for some readers, but it is the structure that makes the book interesting. There may be some spoilers from here, but they should be minor. The principle mystery is how Nell wound up on a dock in Australia at the age of four all by herself with nothing but a suitcase and no name. It is a mystery she herself won't solve in her lifetime, though her quest is the focus of one of the parts of the story. The earliest thing she remembers is the Authoress, and indeed the story revolves around her, which is another part of the story. Working from that memory, and the suitcase she was found with, she endeavors to discover who she is. The third part of the story revolves around her granddaughter, Cassandra, and takes place after Nell's death. She attempts to finish the quest her grandmother began when she is left a mysterious cabin in England. The stories of Nell and her granddaughter interact across time as both of their efforts slowly uncover what exactly happened. We see Nell uncover something about what happened to the Authoress, Cassandra find even more, and then we get what really happened. The clues are there for the reader to guess at what happened, but the thrill is in the discovery. The only problem I had was that near the end the narrative surrounding the Authoress kind of kicked into overdrive and I lost a bit of the empathy I was feeling for them. There are so many characters we are supposed to care about that I can't care about any of them to the extent I should. I almost think the novel would have been better served with only two main narratives, but I did enjoy the way she weaved everything together.

1594203059|1.0|A simplistic rehash of unsubstantiated theories, replete with inaccuracies and convenient omissions. Does he have a staff of flunkies churning out this garbage, and he just signs his name to it? The book in many places reads like it's the product of a Tom Friedman idea generator. I teach this stuff at the graduate level, and am very familiar with the topic. If you want something good on the subject, check out The Wealth and Poverty of Nations by David Landes or Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond. This book might make a good doorstop, but that's about it.

B001KEHAI0|5.0|Just about anytime this is on the tube, I'll sit down and watch it - commercials and all. This is just one of those kind of movies, and happened to be when Bill Murray was at his best. Why I didn't have it on DVD before is a mystery to me, but there was no cringing at paying $9.99 for this on Blu-Ray. Quality just fine thank you.<br /><br />Perhaps I'll write the same exact thing tomorrow....(or, did I write this yesterday?)
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I find this movie to be entertaining and filled with action. I originally saw this movie in a movie theater and enjoyed watching it at home as well. There is a code inside that allows you to play a game online.  Haven't played the game yet. This movie keeps you thinking and doesn't have any times where the story lags. Good entertainment.
B005PS4ZQW|4.0|I would just like to reiterate DavidK's comments that the Kindle version of this book is a major mess.  I bought it anyway as I much prefer electronic editions, largely because you can set the font size and my vision is not that great these days.  Like him, though, I have now had to also order the hardcover version.  Otherwise this book does seem like the most straightforward way to learn VHDL, and I say this after reading several other books and sitting through a number of Xilinx's training videos.  All of these failed to help me break through the initial confusion of trying to figure out how to fit all the workflow pieces together.<br /><br />It just makes sense to guide someone step by step through the first couple projects when the process is this complex.  VHDL is complex enough without having to simultaneously untangle a complex and cryptic (to the beginner) development environment.  There's considerably more to implementing an FPGA than \\"just\\" learning a hardware design language.  There are also things such as simulation, timing, clock propagation timing and jitter, I/O constraints, synthesis, implementation, fitting, optimization...  These can be more difficult than simply writing the code.  In the absence of a mentor this book is the next best approach.<br /><br />Be aware that the book uses the modelSim simulation software, which used to be available in a free version, but is now quite expensive (unless you have proof that you're a student).  Xilinx provides the iSim simulator with their free web ISE, but you can't rely on this book for help with it.  Xilinx does provide an iSim User's Guide, though.

B0084IG8TM|4.0|While watching 'The Hunger Games' I immediately thought of two staple school short stories:  Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\" and \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\".  Despite these familiar elements, the author and movie makers make everything else their own.  I like this kind of social science fiction movie because it takes a look at society at large and makes us wince at our worst tendencies (brutality as a spectacle), and contrasts it will a reality wake-up call brimming with common decency.<br /><br />In this near future setting wars and rebellions have ravaged North America, and a police force and other powers that be find that human sacrifice is their solution (not unlike the Mayans).  Although they don't elaborate--at least not in the movie--it seems our near-future world is making pagan sacrifices and providing Coliseum entertainment to a vain and voyeuristic cosmopolitan audience.<br /><br />Twenty-four youth participants (Tributes) are chosen by lottery (where the crowd shows grim resignation.  So much for \\"What if they had a 'Hunger Games' and nobody played.\\") and from each district (12) to fight it out in the wilderness with some contrived elements added added to the mix (not unlike '[[ASIN:B00005JOAQ Survivor 3: Africa - The Complete Season]]'). While it would be a spoiler to give the details of their feats and challenges, they train in an opulent capitol city, complete with obstacle courses and combat situations.  Harrelson (a sponser and former survivor), Tucci (a slick TV host of the Games), Banks (a gaudy, hyperventilating elite), and Sutherland (perhaps CEO of the Games) play among the status quo, and Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are the young protagonists who add a foil element to contrast the hardened adults.  And, while some of the uglier characteristics are a bit overplayed by the mentioned adult actors, the subtlety is exchanged for a presentation that is sharp and astute enough for our full appreciation.<br /><br />Once they start going the contest is riveting with some character faults and attributes sorting out the contestants.<br /><br />If small extrapolations in science fiction books and movies can make us review and renew our world, then, by golly, I am all for it. This movie is worth seeing as more than food for thought, however, and the movie makers make their point in a way that both makes it easier for us to go along for the ride while we are rooting for their heroes.
B005E94WB0|5.0|This case fits the Plantronics Voyager series headsets perfectly.<br /><br />I use it mostly in the car.  Instead of just tossing the headset in the console in my dashboard, I place it in the case first.  A magnet keeps the flap down and closes the case.  It protects it enough to keep the earpiece clean and undamaged.  Plus, it makes the headset easier to find among other items.  I can imagine women also using this case to protect their headset in a purse.<br /><br />Though it will probably not protect your headset from catastrophic damage (i.e., getting sat on, stepped on, or crushed) it will protect it from being twisted, bent, or scratched from being in contact with other items.<br /><br />Worth the $8 to protect your investment of a quality Bluetooth headset.
0156027321|5.0|The Life of Pi is like The Old Man and the Sea kicked up a notch with wild animals that certainly don't belong in the ocean and a 16 year old boy. Part 1 of the story is full of amusing honesty, entertaining writing, and fascinating educational passages about religion and animals. One of the most interesting themes in the book was how similar zoology and religion are. I didn't know they were similar either, but the stuff that the author points out kind of blew my mind. Part 2 is an incredible tale of survival. Why are tales of survival so enduring and riveting? He fishes, he eats, he drinks and I'm glued to the pages. The way the plot is told is very interesting. You know a lot of facts upfront. It's not one of those stories that makes you wonder if or when he gets rescued. The thing that moves the plot along is the awesome journey that Pi takes physically and mentally.<br /><br />I couldn't stop thinking about this book. I have pages and pages of notes, questions, and thoughts while I was reading it. I had no idea going into this book that it would fill my mind with so many deep thoughts and questions. And yet this was not a difficult book to read. The writing is stunning and flows very well. The only reason it took me so long to read the book is because I kept pondering the meaning of life. The ending, quite simply, took me completely by surprise.  It was so twisty...that I can't even put it into words.  Read this book - you won't be the same again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I didn't have much trouble with pesky ads like some of you say. It was fairly enjoyable and the only ads that popped up were after the game set up the cards. The ads that I came across were easy to get out of anyway. Over all, I would recommend this game.
0143119680|5.0|This is not in any way a high school vampire romance.  It's definitely more mature and takes you across the world in a high speed dangerous chase.  Enemies in every corner waiting to kill, strange new creatures that frighten yet elicit your curiosity.  I fell in love with all the characters and quickly hated the villains so this definitely was a well told story from beginning to the end.
044656740X|1.0|What Mr Robert Kiyosaki has actually developed is a scam that is under current legislation and business regulations, entirely legal.  However, that does make it good business practice and it seems far from ethical.  Essentially he preaches; \\"Do what the rich and myself have done and you will become rich\\"  But what has he actually done to become so rich?  Well, while he extols the common knowledge of not having credit cards and investing in property to get rich, what Mr Kiyosaki is actually currently doing to make all his millions is writing books and delivering 'training' (incidentally charged at hugely inflated prices, £2000 for 3 days 'training' and up to £200 for his board game and not to mention his books) on how to get rich. He offers no actual real hard evidence that he has got rich by practising what he preaches.  Now, this is the clever bit for reeling in the gullible public.  His books and 'training' has the disclaimer, \\"this is not a get rich fast\\" promise.  No surprise there!  So here are the flaws and cons with Mr Kiyosaki's methods for getting rich.<br />Flaw and Con 1: His books are not research based and not evidenced for what actually works in terms of promoting wealth in the real world.  Lacking evidence based practice for anything no matter what is from gardening to sport should at best be regarded with a high degree of suspicion and caution.  Essentially, this means that his books and 'training' is, and I am being kind here, nothing more than waffle.<br />Flaw and Con 2: This so called 'training' that he 'delivers' on how to get rich is not accredited, assessed or approved by any external body or independent assessment organisation, for example like City & Guilds.  Therefore, it is not recognised by anyone or anything. Why is this a problem for the prospective candidate on one of his courses? Well, because if there is no kind of formal recognition for the 'training' that he delivers then there is no kind of set standard for the quality or fitness of purpose for which it is intended.  Given that you are being asked to part with £2000 that should be an immediate and significant pause for thought.  Alarm bells should be ringing at this point!  Simply ask yourself, would you be impressed by someone's business acumen knowing that they had parted with £2000 for something that an unqualified, unverified and unapproved person had created and then sold them.  I think not.<br />Flaw and Con 3: If his methods of getting rich are so good and so effective, take the time to ask yourself why on Earth is he bothering to take the time and energy (and its an awful lot) to help everyone else do the same thing?!  Surely he would be better off focusing on practising his methods for getting rich? Well, it because his books and 'training' are his real vehicle for success and means of income.  I mean lets be honest, he is making an absolute fortune at selling waffle to anyone who will part with cash to listen to him.<br />Flaw and Con 4: Property investment is and always will be high risk and should never be taken for granted.  There are many cases where really clever successful people have gone under and lost even their home let alone their money on a bad decision or the insurance man's get out clause of, 'an act of God'.  I have been a professional in the building trade for decades and I know that it takes years of considerable experience to assess a building as either a gold mine or a money pit. Mr Kiyosaki could not hope to instil a fraction of the kind of knowledge and experience you need to assess a good property assessment in a mere 3 days 'training', no matter how good it was.<br />Flaw and Con 5: Let us for a moment ask, why Mr Kiyosaki is apparently helping us all to be financially educated, as he puts it. What are his motives for doing this?  I strongly suspect that it has nothing to do with any noble ideas about benefiting humanity or some altruistic notions.  I strongly suspect he is doing it because he has found avehicle for his waffle that legally exploits the naive and gullible.  What he does may not be ethical, but it is legal.  There is now law prohibiting anyone from charging people for listening to them waffle about anything.<br />So what can we conclude then.  Well fair play to him, he has found a way to make a lot of money, no doubt about it. But I am deeply suspicious that his fortune has been made in the way he claims given how much money he makes from his 'training' and merchandise.  In his books and 'seminars' he asks the audience not to be suspicious of his methods and reasoning, if you fall for that you'll fall for anything. I say be suspicious of and question anything that is not evidence based and independently checked especially when you are being asked to part with so much of your hard earned cash!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I read some of the other reviews, and I have to agree that this book really is out of the Twilight Zone. I started reading it one evening, and the next thing I knew, it was 4:00 in the morning. I am a huge fan of everything I have read from this author. He has the ability and imagination to frighten me and keep me creeped out. I have been reading horror and fright since I was my daughter's age. It's not very often that I come across someone like him. His mind is twistedly one-of-a-kind. I can't wait for Pines 2!

0811869261|5.0|Marc Boutavant is an amazing illustrator, and I am happy to see some of his work appearing in the US. In this reusable sticker book, a little bear named Mouk travels around the world, reporting back to his friends about all of his adventures. The pages are filled with bold, colorful illustrations.<br /><br />While the scenes may be too busy for some kids, my daughter reveled in this search-and-find style. The pages are filled with interesting tidbits about the cultures and customs of the 11 countries that Mouk visits (Finland, Greece, Libya, Burkina Faso, Madagascar, India, China, Australia, Japan, Peru, ending in NYC). I even learned new things from this book!<br /><br />The quality of the stickers are fantastic, and unlike many others, are truly reusable. We have played with this book many times, shifting the stickers around on the page, and they are easy to take off and stick in a new spot.

0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice was one of the remaining Austen novels I have not read (Northanger Abbey is the other one). Emma, Mansfield Park, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion...loved them all. So I figured it was about time I pick this one up off my shelf.<br /><br />Boy, I was not disappointed! It almost felt like coming back to an old friend, even though I have never read P&P before. But I know the story very well, having fallen in love with the BBC series. And I loved it. I loved it so much that I don't know what to say. It is that good. And it is jumping right up to the top of my all-time favorite lists.<br /><br />It's witty - I love the early banter between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth when Jane is recovering from an illness at Mr Bingley's home. It's funny - Mr Collins just cracks me up, and you just have to laugh at Mrs Bennett's scheming. Almost 200 years later, it is still a page turner. And as much as I love reading classics, I would not describe most of them as a page turner!<br /><br />It is also a comfort book. I can't help but love almost all of the characters, despite their flaws. Immersing yourself in the novel is like having a cup of tea with an old friend. It's a joy to read, and I am positive that over the years I will be reading it again...and again...and again.
0061692042|5.0|What would Canadian Noir, if one were writing a 'Saturday Night Show' skit be like? If I ignore all of the warnings that I may sound politically incorrect, well, dare I signal that I agree that many stereotypes have a basis in reality? Dare I say this book seemed to me what a stereotype-Canadian Noir genre book would be like? Should I go further and say I suspect the author of having his little joke in writing a stereotype-Canadian Noir stylized book? Yes. In advance, apologies for saying it aloud after all. Even if I'm wrong, I couldn't help giggling at the thought. The writing appears to purposely diminish dramatic tension. At every point where in an American Noir genre novel the reader would get a cliff-hanger ending before the next chapter, the narrator, Dell, reveals the outcomes and endings before the actions of the next chapter start. Dell tells the story of his childhood after informing the reader that he is near retirement as a teacher in a school, for example, right at the beginning. The reader knows right away that Dell survived and went on with his education to teach. As Dell tells his story in the book, written in a tone as realistic as if he were sitting in a chair verbally speaking to you, with absolutely none of the flourishes that a written story would have, indeed, in the exact voice of a real 15 year old boy who is an inexperienced storyteller, it will take some perseverance to read through the early chapters. There is almost no tension in this book, with the exceptions of occurrences where one might think, ok, this is where the narrator becomes unreliable, or this is where it will step out into a mystery...and then Dell explains the actual outcome, and then he calmly explains how it happened.<br /><br />Even more deflating, when I was three chapters from the end of the book, I was thinking, ok, this is a reflection of Joseph Conrad's book, 'The Heart of Darkness' and even a hint of Conrad's 'Secret Agent', and F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby'.......when that's exactly what Dell confirms as he explains what books his childhood reminds him of. Do I hear the author giggling? Yes, I believe I do....<br /><br />Why read this book, then? Because it's a writer's book to be studied for its construction and its style. Because the writing is voice perfect. Because Dell's story is of interest. Because in observing how the characters behave, react and succeed, or not, is to stir up memories of real people similar to those in the book. Perhaps in the mirror Ford holds for you to see these people, you may discover insight that escaped in the reading of \\"The Heart of Darkness\\".<br /><br />Other things I noticed:<br /><br />Berner - Burner? She is the American twin who goes off to seize her future in her own hands, burning with purpose and self-assurance, skeptical of authority.<br />Dell - a small valley, surrounded with trees? Dell, the Canadian, uncertain, shy, the 'good' twin who obeys and follows instructions, unassuming, fearful, thinks positive.<br /><br />Great Falls, Montana, 'The Electric City' - where lightening metaphorically strikes Dells family and a great fall occurs.<br /><br />Half of the book takes place in America and the other half in Saskatchewan, Canada - but a mere 125 miles away separates Great Falls and Partrean. The author establishes there is not much of an landscape change, although the environment changes through the people Dell meets. Dell's mother Neeva discouraged assimilation with locals wherever the Parsons lived because she had pretensions of superiority. When Dell no longer has the protection and guidance of his parents, he must create inner resources from almost nothing. Crossing the border between Canada and America was akin to crossing the river Styx, where Dell ends up in a kind of purgatory (the Greek meaning), where time appears to stop. Many of the adults that lead him to the next stages in his journey give him advice on how to survive in life and how to guide himself emotionally.<br /><br />Some of the advice Dell accepts or notices or rejects:<br /><br />\\"Which may finally be the only real difference between one place on the earth and another: how you think about the people and the difference it makes to you to think that way.\\"<br /><br />\\"' Well, it's not as if there's a race we have to win, is there?'\\"<br /><br />\\"He needed me to do what sons do for their fathers: bear witness that they're substantial, that they're not hollow, not ringing absences.

0375703764|4.0|I first saw this novel years ago, and it caught my interest, but I never got around to reading it. Finally, about two months ago, I saw it on my brother-in-law's bookshelf, and borrowed it. I was in for quite a ride.<br /><br />There is both a lot going on in the plot, and a lot of very little. The main plot, if there is such a thing, is the story of a photojournalist and his family who move into a house that turns out to be a wee bit bigger on the inside than the outside. The analysis of The Navidson Record, a documentary made by the photojournalist as his family adjusted to their new home and discovered it wasn't quite normal, is written by an old guy named Zampano, who died in his apartment. His book was discovered by Johnny Truant, a self admitted liar and druggie whose life slowly begins to spin out of control in the footnotes of the book. Rounding out the narrators is \\"the editors\\" who occasionally throw in their own two cents.<br /><br />Confused? Welcome to the House of Leaves! It is a dizzying, fascinating book.<br /><br />You can't review House of Leaves without mentioning it's unusual styling, a postmodern piece of art. Each narrator has their own font, which really helps the reader follow what's going on and from whose perspective. As the family - and outsiders who become involved in the exploration-delve into the mysteries of the house, they begin to expose themselves to a dark exploration of their psyche and interpersonal relationships. The text mimics both the action, and the emotional state of mind each person is in. It turns, twists, reduces to only a few words per page...it is a dizzying effect, but relatively easy to follow. And guaranteed to be unlike any book you have ever read.

B005MYEQ4U|3.0|I miss the Woody Allen films of yesteryear: [[ASIN:B002XZNHG4 Annie Hall]], [[ASIN:B00005AUJK Crimes and Misdemeanors]], [[ASIN:0767819764 Manhattan Murder Mystery]], and so forth.  Woody Allen should stop churning out a movie a year.  He should instead focus on making great films as they come to him.  The new yearly, European excursion to be inflicted upon audiences is Midnight in Paris.  A man of the twenty-first century longs for the golden years of Paris in the 1920s.  The rain, the city, and the writers and artists are just too good to not want to join.  And Gil gets his wish, every night at midnight.<br /><br />The whimsical story of a time travel is rather funny and cute.  The Fitzgeralds, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, and so many others offer a fanciful cast of characters for Gil to interact with and react to.  In fact, the best the film has to offer is Gil's boyish wonderment and fascination with everything going on.  Owen Wilson is superb.  His facial expressions are priceless.  It is a rather simple movie with a simple plot, but the magic of Gil's travels back in time and his child-like wonderment is a treat.  Adrian Brody is hilarious as Dali, he really steals the scene.<br /><br />The acting for the rest of the cast seems heavy-handed.  Inez is annoying; painfully so.  Her parents and friends are so pretentious it's difficult to watch them.  It's almost as if Allen is writing and directing for audiences he thinks are too dense to get it.  Or he is writing about people that are just unbearable.<br /><br />If you can suffer through the \\"present day\\" scenes, the golden age of Paris in the 1920s is good for a delightful laugh.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Would give 0 stars if I could.  The stories dont intertwine so dont be fooled by that intrigue.  its 6 short stories that are not interesting and dont get better.  its not a thinker or a mystery, and wont leave you wondering \\"whoa what happened\\" like a deep literary masterpiece.  instead you will be googling \\"seriously, what happened, i somehow missed it\\" but you didnt miss it, the book sucked, thats it.  also, i painstakingly  wrote this review on my kindle which is time consuming and tedious so please disregard punctuation.

030758836X|4.0|Gillian Flynn's dizzying, addictive thriller wants to ask you a question: how well do you know the person you're married to? Are you confident you actually know what they're capable of?<br /><br />Maybe you should keep some protection close by. Just in case.<br /><br />Something terrible happens on the morning of Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth anniversary. Amy vanishes without a trace, leaving behind evidence of a struggle in their home on the Mississippi River. What happened that day gets teased out slowly as the narrative shifts between Nick's narrative of the investigation and Amy's diary entries leading up to the fateful day. Nick publicly claims to be innocent but can't help coming across the wrong way to the police and media who descend on the scene. It doesn't help that he admits (to the reader) to keeping secrets from the police and his family. Nick isn't who he is trying to appear to be, but is Amy?<br /><br />Appearances are very important in Gone Girl--how we may present different versions of ourselves to the world depending on the circumstance, and especially how they can be dangerously misleading. Marriage (specifically as a long-term relationship) is also key. Of course, Gone Girl takes a common problem (how do you keep the magic alive after the courtship is over?) and takes it to an extreme (how far are you willing to go to get revenge on someone who stopped trying/stopped pretending?), but that's the nature of a thriller.<br /><br />To say anything more about the plot would do the reading experience a great disservice. Gone Girl is a book that depends on its twists, and this is the rare case when an author manages to pull off every single one of them. Best of all is that she knows when to stop. I've read far too many mystery/thriller authors who just can't resist having one last surprise (*cough*MICHAELCONNELLY*cough*), and it almost always makes an otherwise good book ridiculous. Not so with Gillian Flynn.<br /><br />If I were still working in a bookstore this would be my book of the summer. Without a doubt. Going to the beach? Need something to read on the plane? Want something fun to read that isn't completely brainless? Depressed that the 50 Shades of Grey books have become so ubiquitous? Just looking for something good to read? This is the book for you. Now go get it. Go. Now.<br /><br />Grade: B+<br /><br />PS Upon finishing this, a friend told me that none other than Reese Witherspoon has acquired the film rights and is going to star in the movie version. She was disappointed (she pictured Charlize Theron), but I'm really excited about it.<br /><br />Really excited.re this would be my book of the summer. Without a doubt. Going to the beach?

1612183956|5.0|Blake has written another good one. I've read RUN and EERIE along with some of his short stories and other work where he collaborated with other writers and he is never dull or uninteresting.<br /><br />Few writers setup their worlds as well as Blake. He draws you in and has you off-balance every step of the way. Right when you start feel for the characters and hope against all hopes that things will be okay, Blake always rips the rug out from under you.<br /><br />PINES is very much in the vein of a modern day SHUTTER ISLAND. A story about a guy who doesn't know which way is up and things get stranger and stranger as he moves through a new town, not really sure how he got there either. Our guy doesn't know what is happening to him and the reader doesn't know if the guy is in a strange land or if he's just crazy.<br /><br />You won't know the answers (and you won't guess them) until the very end.<br /><br />Check out PINES people... it's a pretty good one.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I can't add a lot to what already was said about this book, the first half is about Stephen King's life and the second half is tips to improve your writing.  At first I wasn't sure why someone this famous couldn't fill the book with writing tips and advice, why put filler in?  But after reading the book from \\"cover to cover\\" (Kindle) it made sense.  The backstory about his life is what made him a successful writer(along with a lot of hard work).

B002GY9F9K|4.0|As many other reviewers have noted, Legend of the Seeker is very derivative. It's basically a melange of Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Dune. Despite that, this is an entertaining TV show. It's amazingly well done for a weekly TV show. The sets, wardrobes, and special effects are all very convincing. It's a real feat to have accomplished this for every week for two years.<br /><br />However, the show rarely goes beyond that - entertaining. Scratch beneath the surface, and it looks pretty shallow. The show relies a lot on supermodels in sexy suits and fight scenes. The story doesn't go far beyond \\"kill the tyrant\\". Each episode throws the heroes in yet another perilous situation, many of which seem to have little relationship with the ultimate goal of actually killing the tyrant. The characters constantly make ridiculous choices, constantly putting the larger mission on hold to rescue kittens from trees or go look for yet another magical jewel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the larger effect is to undermine the show and make the world less believable. While there's plenty of eye candy, I don't find myself caring for any of the characters the way I might care for Frodo or Luke Skywalker. I get the sense the show was made with Twilight fans in mind. Definitely worth checking out if you need a fix of fantasy (or just want to watch the gorgeous Briget Regan), but nothing I saw makes me want to go read Terry Goodwin's books. Overall, 3.5 stars.

B007SPPANM|5.0|Titanic and Avatar and the LOTR: The Return of the King are in a class of their own in terms of unique quality.  High budget, exceptionally directed, and a wow that succeeds in so many aspects of movie making, arguably the best picture ever shot on film.  Romance is a genre that is loved as much as it is hated (not even critically) so I'm not surprised that its not on every critically acclaimed or fan made website or a top reviewer (wall street, flixter) that taps directly in with public praise.  It takes meticulous professional and emotionally-perceptional reviewers to really rate the quality of the motion picture.. and well in a era that has produced some of the highly renown and top rated movies of all time - the 90's.. Titanic went for 14 Academy awards and won 11.  Statistically it's the best movie ever brought to film.  Now sure every genre has its lovers and haters cause their its impossible to please everyone.. but I've seen over 500 movies throughout my life time and as bright coming critic - (well I've been one my whole life really) Titanic has yet to be beat respectively.

Cara is a former enemy who joins the heroes, but she's conflicted in his morality. Tabrett Bethell does a great job bringing confidence and sarcasm to the character - a nice addition to an otherwise overly wholesome bunch.<br /><br />Overall, 3.5 stars.

B005ZMTYBY|5.0|I love Christmas more than pretty much anything in the world, and Halloween/fall shortly after.  I'm a Christmas purist and saw this movie for the first time at age 19, in June I think, and was unimpressed.  A year later I picked it back up around Halloween and then it hit me.  It had been so long since I was a kid and I had grown so removed from the magic feeling of the season, but when Jack, the King of Halloween, discovers Christmastown, it all comes back.  Seeing someone from a completely outside perspective discover the magic and happiness of Christmas really makes me appreciate the season all the more, and I can recapture the feeling of being a kid at Christmastime.  Besides that, the animation is absolutely spectacular.  I know others have seen it once and then never again, like myself, but if you are a fan of Christmas, I urge you to watch it again.<br /><br />As a side note, as I purchased this from Amazon's online video service, I've really appreciated being able to watch this movie from pretty much anywhere--my work computer, home computer, anyone else's computer, my Kindle.
0062068423|5.0|Excellent early Harry Hole detective mystery. Oslo policeman Harry Hole is given a promotion to detective due to a tragic mishap during an assignment. He is moved upstairs to work in POT (secret service) and he becomes entwined in crimes linked to racist skinheads and ultimately to WWII Norwegian volunteers soldiers who fought for Germany in the Eastern front. The story jumps back to the past from 1942 and and forward to the present 2000. Early on we have a good idea who the murderer but we do not know why and what ties the various murders together with the past. As first there was so much of this book devoted to the past I thought Harry would take a back seat in most of this book but Harry comes out strong in the second half of the book. Nicely woven together at the end.
B008VIKLWA|3.0|We took our kids to go see this movie at the dollar theater on a rainy day during family camping. Thought the trailers looked good so we gave it a shot instead of a cartoon movie.  The kids really enjoyed watching the story of the chimpanzees. Even the 3 year old was able to talk about the movie afterward. Do be aware though, that this is a documentary movie with only narration, no scripted dialogue and no people in the movie.
0345803485|1.0|Okay, I bought this book out of curiosity because a lot of people who I know said it's a good book and it's hard to put down.  It was one of those books that after you read, it's hard to settle back into reality... thinking every man is as \\"dark\\" and \\"mysterious\\" as Christian Grey.  I read the reviews and it sure spoiled my drive to read it because everyone pointed out the obvious reasons why it's such a terrible book.  If you are about to buy this book, and you believe there is some fairytale happy lalala tall dark and handsome guy out there who's a dominant, by all means... Waste $10 bucks. If you have common sense and have at least a clue that men DO NOT act like Christian Grey (VERY handsome, rich, nice, sex-driven, gray eyed, luxurious hair, deep demanding voice)... You will take my words and the 100,000 people who rated this book POORLY.  Who has EVER heard of a 21 year old girl who's a virgin, and has only been kissed twice!?!?!?! and not to mention the REPETITION; \\"blushed\\" \\"flush\\" \\"hid under my eyelashes\\" \\"his dark gray eyes\\" \\"he feels my sex\\" \\"collapsed as he filled me with him\\"... Like really? It's on EVERY page at least 4 times.<br /><br />To conclude: This book wasn't even worth $10 and the amazon prime two day shipping.  Yea, it's THAT BAD. I don't know who the f!@# thought this book was a best seller, cuz I literally skipping PAGES and PAGES of pure boring literature. There was literally one or two full chapters of them emailing each other boring s!@#.

Apple continues to do so today. Yet, they are now a maturing company and their arrogance usually leads to a downfall. It happened at Qualcomm,Doubleclick,Harmonic,Intel,Microsoft,EMC and the list goes on and on!!!!

B002MQYOFW|4.0|When I fly internationally, I usually watch movies that I wouldn't normally watch at home. Back when my wife and I were together, I thought it was funny. We'd be scrolling through a list of movies to watch and I would say \\"I saw that\\" and she would look at me like I was crazy and ask in a very surprised tone \\"when did you see THAT?\\" Well, we're not really together any more (but we are getting along better) but I am still travelling internationally. On a recent trip to Mexico, I realized I had caught up on every George Clooney movie, so I decided to give The Hunger Games a chance.<br />All I knew about The Hunger Games was what a religious leader I respect had said \\"it's terrible that so many people are excited about a movie that glorifies killing people\\" (or something close to that).  I guess I also knew that there was a dude in the movie that my daughters thought was hot. So I settled in and watched a movie that I knew nothing about, with little opinion about what to expect (kind of like watching a George Clooney movie<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007JRU2UK The Descendants]],<br /> but with young people in it).  In the end, I was entertained and eager to watch with the girls when I returned home to the states.<br />While we waited for the movie to become available to the rest of the public, Lorna read the whole series.  I finished reading the first 4 Song of Ice and Fire books and Tom Andry's  Bob Moore<br />[[ASIN:B0061MDIZA Bob Moore: Desperate Times]]<br />series. While I waited for Tom's knew book and the 5th Ice and Fire book to be more reasonably<br />[[ASIN:0345529057 A Song of Ice and Fire, Books 1-4 (A Game of Thrones / A Feast for Crows / A Storm of Swords / Clash of Kings)]]<br />priced, I decided to read the first book of the Hunger Games.<br />My ex playfully mocked me \\"that's a book for teenage girls\\". Yeah, but I saw the movie and it was good and it's sitting around the house for free, so I ignored her jabs.  Since I was a teenager, I have been very interestedin apocalyptic scenarios, when my kids were younger, I became less interested, but lately I have been really interested in predictions of what could happen to us. My religious friend was kinda right, killing is glorified in this book, but only as a form of oppression.  The citizens of Panem are lucky enough to not live in a time of bipartisan bickering. They live in a time that probably resulted from it, only in this future scenario, there is absolute power, and they remind their citizens of this power by putting on The Hunger Games.<br />As a fan of rebellion, intelligence and resourcefulness, I can't help but love the main character \\"Katniss\\" and sympathize with her plight as she reluctantly becomes the star of The Hunger Games.  I am left intrigued at the end and wanting more, wandering what happens in the next 2 books, how does she handle her relationships with Gale and Peeta, what happens to her Mom and sister, what would George Clooney do? I check and A Dance with Dragons is still $14.99 to download, while Lorna has the second book of The Hunger Games downloaded on her Kindle, I guess I will find some of the answers to my questions while I wait on more reasonable pricing.

030758836X|1.0|So I never write reviews on Amazon, but I felt compelled to put in my two cents about this book.  I payed full price for this book at B&N, and I wish I could get my money back!  Serves me right for buying a hardcover.  I found this book to be mildly entertaining as I was reading it (the beginning was a bit slow, but it picked up toward the middle), but the ending was terrible.  Terrible as in, 'wait, that's the ending?  where's the rest of the book?'  I'm not the kind of person who demands a nice, happy ending for every book I read, but this ending was completely incongruous with the rest of the book.  I assume the author was aiming for some kind of \\"modern\\" or \\"psychologically complex\\" ending, but it just felt unfinished and unbelievable.  Trust me, if you're a regular reader of thriller/mystery books, you'll be very disappointed in this one.  I get the feeling that all the 'buzz' about this book is coming from paid critics, since I know I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.  I give it a few months of fame before it fades into obscurity.
1439148953|5.0|________________________________________<br />Maybe this one should have won the Booker in 2010, rather than the large baggy monster that was so over-hyped. Toibin, like William Trevor (why do so many good contemporary novelists start with a 'T'?) is a subtle writer who knows how to tell a good story from the inside.<br /><br />Eilis the heroine reminded me very much of Trevor's Felicia in Felicia's Journey and is not a million miles away from Brian Moore's Judith Hearne and his Eileen Hughes. The poor Irish lass, as ever, adrift in an alien environment, exploited and humiliated as usual has become almost an Irish stereotype. But sometimes cliche situations work because of the way they are treated by the author. We understand and sympathise with the lonely passions of these sad case Irish heroines. I found myself rationing my reading in order to savour Eilis's dilemma. No, it's not a love story so much as an examination of cultural conflict. And unlike Judith and Felicia, Eilis is active rather than passive. Once she grows up in America she makes things happen and is, like all tragic protagonists, in effect the author of her own doom. There is an open question at the end: can she return to her American lover with the same purity of heart that she had shown earlier? I tend to like these open-ended stories; they return you to life with all its ambiguities.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I thought this story was very well written. The characters were well developed and the story line kept me interested and in suspence until the end.<br />I'm an avid reader and appreciate stories that are different and have an edge. This book fulfilled my reading needs
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I have never written a review before, but after reading book one of Fifty Shades I just had to say my piece. I found that I could not get in this story as hard as I tried. Fifty Shades is written so immaturely that I was totally bored, but because of all the hype I pushed on. Really the women who find this book stimulating must live very sheltered lives. Fifty Shades has no story line, unless you consider Ana's biting her lip or rolling her eyes and Christian spanking her. I agree with one of the other reviews that Ana sounds more like a teenager then a graduated college student. E. L. James must have some kind of pull with his publishing company to have Fifty Shades on the Best Selling List. Christian introduction into sexual adulthood by \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" screwed him up royaly. Ana's immaturity is a little hard to believe in this century. I can understand her curiousity about Christian's lifestyle, but not ever hearing about BDSM is rediculous. Now that I have read the other reviews I will not bother reading the next two and I will save my $20.00 for more interesting reading.
0307730697|5.0|Adam Brown is a true American Hero and so much more. My heart goes out to his wife and kids but someday they will get to see him again.  \\"I got it\\".

B0064NTZ6W|5.0|[[ASIN:B0064NTZ6W Das Boot (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />I had to buy this DVD. I remember the first time I saw this movie it was after chow on board my submarine while at sea and the place was packed not a extra space any where almost everyone off duty had turned out to watch the movie (it was the first showing). As the movie progressed we got more evolved in it, feeling more for the U Boat crew as they lived threw the events of their patrol. As it evolved. It was so quit you could hear the air circulation fans running and their very quit. We almost became one with the crew of that U Boat feeling what they were feeling. It was a very well made movie and represented the life on the old diesel boats. Both theirs and ours. I would highly recommend this movie and in Blu-ray it really  brings it to life.

0307386171|4.0|________________________________________<br />Just finished On Chesil Beach. I see now that Edward was not quite as shy and sensitive as I thought. I'm glad about that. I felt a great sense of relief when he let fly at Florence for her frigidity, but also sad for her.<br /><br />What about him being a bit of a pugilist though? He didn't seem the type to hang around pubs at night looking for `a spot of bovver.' I liked him when he stood up for his Jewish pal however, and understood his qualms about betraying his own ideals of good form etc. Was this broadening of Edward's character done to prepare us for his verbal assault on Florence at the end?<br /><br />I thought the sex scene was well-handled, even if Edward''s private person wasn't! I didn't find it, as one reader did, 'a crude exposure of something never usually dealt with at length.' But then I was brought up on Henry Miller and have recently peeked into my 14 year-old son's My Booky Wook.<br /><br />I was reminded of another fine novel about a musician - The Soloist by Mark Salzman. There, too, an obsession with music seems to cancel out sex drives. What is it about musicians?<br /><br />Another reader says On Chesil Beach is 'a tragedy of \\"what ifs.\\"' Well, aren't all tragedies this? Don't we feel with Othello - 'the pity of it, Iago'? If only someone had said a word at the right time . . . but it's more than that here: it's a combination of many large and tiny details that lead to the misalliance. And even if they'd got over this problem, they'd have got bored with each other, brought up the past, blamed each other and themselves.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|This has been wonderful. I ordered the cd and it came very quickly. The cd had no scratches and works perfects. I love the music on it. I have no regrets or complaints about the overall transaction
B001UW58YK|5.0|Michael Buble is so smooth, personable and gifted with a voice that makes the standards of yesterday pop with a modern groove that is worthy of being mentioned among Sinatra and Dean Martin. I love how humble he is about his rise to fame and how connected he is to his audiences. Then, there's the concert itself; vibrant and beautifully performed all the way through with an elegant voice and humor. Thank you for the amazing experience! Blu-ray is awesome!

0307592731|3.0|Wild by Cheryl Strayed<br /><br />The story of a young woman whose life has fallen apart and who tries to put it all together - and apparently does - by walking the Pacific Crest Trail.<br /><br />It's difficult to tell a story from a personal point of view and not have your readers hate you by the end of the book. I thought Strayed did quite a good job of keeping us on-side.  She was admittedly completely unprepared for long distance hiking  - or really even for a walk to the supermarket - and her obvious novice errors were funny -  at least for us as readers if not for her. Not only were her decisions about hiking the PCT terrible, they mirrored the dreadful decisions that she had made and continued to make in her life in general. Even though she wrote this book ten years after her PCT hike, and undoubtedly in a more mature state of mind, at least she had the guts to let it all hang out and tell it like she was. I was surprisingly un-bored. Long distance hiking when you're reading about it as well as when you're actually doing it can be tedious stuff. This book wasn't tedious. However, neither was it very insightful. Strayed was pretty good at describing what she did, but not so good at describing what it meant to her - other than in the early scenes surrounding the death of her mother and the shooting of the horse. Also, I found her use of language very ordinary. It wasn't great writing or great thinking. However, despite this it was a more than readable book. Easy and quick, unlike the PCT.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|I've know about this series and the author for a long time before I had the chance to read this book. Anne Rice takes unto herself the old vampire tales and give to the reader a new and thrilling story. Even if you have seen the movies, you NEED to read this book, they fall incredibly short.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|To say Jennifer Lawrence is a fine actor should come as no surprise, given her nod by the Academy for her performance in Winter's Bone. This movie is less a one-note tone, and the lead actress never fails to impress...every shot. The movie's plot and action are not entirely interesting, but Jennifer Lawrence surely makes this a watchable 2 hours.<br /><br />I have read several \\"takes\\" on the sub-text for The Hunger Games...so here's mine. With all of the outlandish costumes, casual opinion of child death, and the miraculous medicines available to the \\"wealthy\\" - I wonder if poorer countries view us in exactly the same way, today. Runway models wear slightly less garish clothes, thousands of Third-world children die every day, and we have the medicine to cure them, but don't. So as we recoil from the indifference and barbarism of the wealthy class in the Hunger Games...
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I discovered this game through my cousin who has the iphone and have been waiting for the android version, and kudos to Amazon for offering it before Google Play. Some reviews say game play is choppy, but the game runs silky smooth on my HTC Evo Shift. I enjoy the missions, items available for purchase and the game itself. Please don't be scared off by the word &quot;purchase&quot; as you can easily earn coins in game for free by grabbing them as you go and through completing missions. I also enjoy grabbing slots tokens to play at the end of each run; prizes include immediate resurrection to continue the game and double coins for your next game. I especially enjoy that there are no annoying ads.
B003FSTN5C|4.0|This show is a 1000x better than NCIS, which I gave up on half way through Season 7. W/NCIS I can watch all the way through Season 6 without a problem, in fact S6,S5,and S4 are some of my favorite seasons of the series. But once S7 was over- I LOVED the Gibbs/Hart storyline so much, the two of them were perfection together- I decided that I was done. I tuned in for the S8 and oh boy, was I sorry. The show just felt different when S9 came around but I gave it a chance, didn't like or care for it, and I gave up once and for all and because of that, when it comes to NCIS, I'm offically done.<br /><br />NCIS Los Angeles, however, is a different story.<br /><br />This show is fantastic! Each week the episode is crisp and funny. The characters are fabulous together and play off each other so well. Keep up the great work SB!<br /><br />5/5 Stars.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Having read a fair amount of Crouch, I expected great characters I'd care about and a fast paced story. Pines delivered. Additionally Pines provided a great ending that was unexpected and satisfying. It was one of those endings that your mind keeps returning to and inspecting. A great read.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and excited for the next book to come out.  The book was very well written.
B000UAFDP2|4.0|This movie is one of Hollywood's great ironies. Verhoeven tried to make a movie about fascism and it just came out looking like a badass action sci fi movie. Really life didn't look all that bad in the movie. They had a prom and psychic ferrets. The book was a bit more spartan. The special effects are holding up quite well I think. The 'Roger Young' is one of my favorite top ten spaceships. Know what number one is? Another great thing about this movie, boobs. Oh yeah, and it is not allowed on the TV when my wife is home. Not because of the boobs. She likes Lifetime movies and this movie is to her what garlic is to a vampire. It's the bugs. They are a bit scary in the giant spikey spider-crab flesh ripping brain sucking sort of way. When my wife falls asleep I put it on to see if she'll notice. I woke up to a 'Sex and the City' marathon last night. I got the menopause cramps real bad now.
B00076ZZ9I|5.0|For those who wants to listen to this legendary album on your DVd player, and watch the interviews for this album, I would buy this CD/DVD. [[ASIN: B00076ZZ9I AC/DC Back In Black (DualDisc)]]
0307744434|5.0|I loved this book.  I thought it was well put together and beautifully written.  The author did a wonderful job at creating this magical world.<br /><br />I found the flow of the narrative easy and not in the least bit distracting from the story.  Other reviewers found it clunky.  I'm not a literary genius.  I read for entertainment value only, so the use of fresh metaphors and breaking out the dictionary for words only used in Scrabble is not at the top of my list of what makes a great book.<br /><br />The book was simply beautiful in imagery and I loved the story presented.  I loved the ending as well.  I think the author did a great job of tying up the story into a nice package.  More often than not, the endings of books these days are clunky - as in I-need-to-hurry-to-meet-a-deadline clunky.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The Innocent is a fast read that keeps you flipping the next page to delve deeper into the mysterious murders that on the surface appear to have no connection. Another enjoyable book by Baldacci.
034580404X|5.0|I have never read a whole book before and wasn't such a fan of reading \\"novels\\",great book!!  Friends were telling me to read these books, but what they didn't tell me is how captivating it will be. It's a great story, besides all the romantic scenes. All around great, never boring! And love the price, its better to order them together. As soon as you finish one,  you're gonna want to have the ther one, so u could read what's gonna happens next. I finished all 3 books in 3 weeks, pretty good for not reading in a long time. Now me sister has them and she loves it!
B008FLYM50|5.0|I'm old by pop standards and soon by anyone's but I remain a pop fan.  There isn't a lot of current stuff that catches my attention mostly because I'm not paying much but I gave this a listen because of a review and wow.  I'm a sucker for a catchy hook so I couldn't give a flying truck about how \\"smart\\" the lyrics are - I don't go to pop for deep meaning.  If the lyrics are clever that's a bonus but certainly not a requirement.  Just tap my foot, please.  With that in mind, consider Electra Heart, double plus good.  Mega hooks, a lovely deep voice and fun lyrics on top.  I checked out her debut and still think this one is better. Hitting repeat as I type.
1439110123|5.0|Dense read, encapsulating everything in the oil industry from the first oil wells in Northwestern Pennsylvania to Rockefeller Standard Oil to the rise in milt-nationals and Middle Eastern surplus. If you have a genuine interest in energy markets, this book is a must. Interesting to see the price fluctuations throughout history on this \\"not so common\\" commodity, and compare it to the wide spread panic we have today on peak oil. Whether it is drilling new holes, applying political pressure, conserving or setting new efficiency regulations, it seemed as if the market has and will continue to respond to this powerful material.<br /><br />Also astonishing is the complexity of the oil market. Fully integrated oil companies of the 19th and 20th century - comprising of production, refinery, shipping, and marketing - has increasingly been discarded for a pell-mell approach that combines nationalized companies with capitalism. My overall take away going into the future is that renewable energy can only be acceptable if the transportation industry adapts as well. 2% of home energy is oil (the rest is mostly natural gas, etc.) but our fuel dependent cars are keeping oil demand high (as well as demand of developing countries). Great book, will see the oil industry as \\"foreign\\" again.
B0086700CM|5.0|i downloaded this game after playing it a few times on a friends Kindle. im sooooooo addicted now!!! its pretty simple, but lots of fun. ive had zero problems with it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|WARNING!!  I will tell you up front I am not a literary student or fanatic.  I don't read books and divulge into themes and how well written or poorly written the book was.  I don't count the grammatical errors as I realize editor's are human too.  I read for the simple enjoyment of being entertained. Don't get me wrong, I've read literary masterpieces and I can contribute to a good book club with the best of them, but really I just enjoy reading for the entertainment value. With that little disclaimer out of the way...<br /><br />My friend recommended this book.  She said it was fantastic.  Uh...no.  No it wasn't.  And I will most likely never trust her judgement on books again.<br /><br />Where to begin. I realize this book started as fan-fiction from Twilight, but there were really too many similarities between the two.  Would it have been too much to ask to come up with more original than lifted material?  Copper hair - check.  Love at first sight - check. Unexplained electrical current when they touch - check. Waitress checking out guy - check.  Guy buying girl expensive car - check.  Eccentric mother who has been married several times and now lives in FL - check.  The whole why-pick-me-I'm-nobody-special - check.  Nightmares regarding possible future with mystery man - check.  I think you get the picture.  This was very distracting to the story, and as a person who likes reading for the story and none of that literary nonsense...this was big issue.<br /><br />We now move onto the repetition of words - jeez by a thesaurus please!!!  Too many mercurial, replete, release, blush, flush, and oh mys.  The list of repetitive words isn't long, but they appear enough to distract you.  In fact, you begin to count them.  I don't want to count words, I just want to read a story.<br /><br />Lastly, the sex was not that hot.  I felt the author, who was trying to write erotica, really missed the boat on the erotica.  The scenes were all just words with no feeling, no emotion.  As with one review, I agree it was vanilla.<br /><br />So I'm not going to go into the plot.  With over 10,000 reviews and the national coverage this baby got, I'm sure you already know the plot.  The purpose of the review is to tell you this book is a joke.  The nuances are so distracting that it was not enjoyable at all.  But I will give the author props for writing a book, because I sure as hell can't do it.<br /><br />This review got two stars, because with all my complaining, I thought the author did an incredible job at the end with hooking the user to buy the next book.  Whether you hated or loved the book, the author left you with a cliff hanger that would make most pick up the next book immediately. Of course, she picked up that little tidbit from Twilight as well (not the cliff hanger itself, just the theme).

B000002OX3|5.0|The Who capped off a successful second year as recording artists with LP number two in Dec. 1966. `A Quick One' is unique in that it is the only Who record in which all four band members contribute songs. It also showed the very beginnings of what would be a well known staple of Pete Townshend's writing - the long concept, or \\"rock opera\\"- which shows up here in the mini-suite title track.  John Entwistle`s strange and often hilarious sense of humor comes to the fore in his notable contributions including the classic \\"Boris the Spider\\" and \\"Whiskey Man\\". Keith Moon contributes a wild instrumental in which all Who members play some kind of horn instrument in \\"Cobwebs and Strange\\".  \\"Run Run Run\\" is a great hard rocker and serves as pulverizing opener. `A Quick One' does what a 2nd album is supposed to do by showing some musical growth while at the same time it builds on the core of the band's sound. As a bonus, the extended version of the CD includes the `Ready Steady Who' EP and some great b-sides such as \\"Doctor, Doctor\\" and \\"I've Been Away\\" (both Entwistle gems).  My only complaint with this current collection (CD extended version) - no \\"Substitute\\", \\"Happy Jack\\" (single version) or \\"I'm a Boy\\". Great early stuff from one of rock's all time greats and an essential part of any Who collection, `A Quick One' didn't make the quartet superstars but it did pave the way for future greatness.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This entire series was excellent. Well written and HOT,HOT,HOT! Good-bye Prince Charming, Hello Christian Grey! This is definately worth rereading!
B0033807C2|5.0|When I got this this book I wasnt expecting much at all but I cant even begin to tell you just how much I enjoyed this book. I think its just a perfect mix of everything people look for in a book and it just struck all the right cords for me. Its the kind of book you will never forget and I will definenately start the reading the spin off series right away.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Objectively, this book is pretty mediocre, with some very strange omissions. For example, there's pretty much no physical description of any character. We know Heat's a hottie because people keep ogling her, but that's about it. If you're a Castle fan, and prepared to acknowledge that Rook is Castle, Heat is Beckett, and so on, you don't need the descriptions. If you're not a Castle fan, you'll probably be a bit frustrated.<br /><br />The plot, well, it's there. It compares well enough with other low-brow mass-market 'mystery' novels that you can find in any airport or used book store discount bin. No thinking required, but decent pacing and enough dead bodies to keep the pages turning. But again, without the context of the characters in the TV show, it's a bit thin.<br /><br />So, if you like Castle and need a little somethin' to hold you over during the summer drought of new episodes, you'll probably enjoy this book.<br /><br />If you've never watched the show (or worse, watched it and hated it), there's really nothing for you here.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Loved the story and all the characters. Wishing I could keep up with them now and see what they are doing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is a completely unrealistic, unfair representation of the BDSM lifestyle. The constant references to the main characters \\"inner goddess\\" and conscience is annoying to the highest degree. The entire book is just ridiculous.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I know the characters aren't likeable, but that's the point. A lot of reviews say how the ending was terrible, but I didn't think so. I think it felt right for the whole theme of the book. I downloaded it on a Saturday and read the first two or three chapters and couldn't stop thinking about it when I went out later that night....on Sunday I spent the whole day (a beautiful day where I should have been outside) reading. Couldn't get enough. I will check out some other books by this author.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I would not recommend this series to anyone who loves literature and reading. For that matter, I would not recommend these books to anyone with a brain. I could probably write a dissertation on why, but I will keep this a brief bulleted summary.<br /><br />1.The sex scenes became annoying before I even finished the first book. At best, I skimmed through them to make sure I didn't miss anything important for the rest of the series.<br /><br />2.Something about all of the allusions bothered me. I'm not sure if I felt that James used way too many allusions, or that they didn't work because she forced them into the text. Maybe she did this to try to increase the intellectual level of the book. I don't know, but I found them annoying as well.<br /><br />3.Anastasia Steele is NOT a heroine! All through the book James wants us to believe that Ana is a strong woman because she holds her ground with Christian. Sorry she's no Jane Eyre and Christian is no Rochester. I would never be with a man who constantly referred to me as a possession. Even in the end I'm not convinced that this was love, more of an obsession.<br /><br />4. The end is unrealistic and anti-climactic. The book would have been far more thought provoking if Christian ended up killing himself when he thinks Ana is taking money out of the bank to leave him. I still would not have liked the books, but maybe we could have dissected it as another modern day Romeo and Juliet tragic ending.<br /><br />I DO NOT recommend this book to ANY serious literature lovers!
B008E374PO|2.0|It is not necessarily a bad thing when an artist decides to take a new musical direction, but I believe it is in Adam Young's best interest that we state our true impressions. That being said, this album takes everything I love about Owl City and throws it out the window. His quirky metaphoric words have been exchanged for simple and often childish lyrics. I felt as if every song had to include something like \\"woo woo\\" or \\"oh oh oh\\". The beautiful complexity of his tunes have also been simplified to sound more repetitive and mainstream.<br />Really, to understand this album, one must simply take \\"Fireflies\\" and compare it to \\"Good Time\\". \\"I like to make myself belieeeeeve that planet eaaarth turns sloowwwwwwlyyy\\" has turned into \\"Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\\".<br />Listen to it online before you buy it. You may want to spend your money on something more worthy like Ed Sheeran's +.
0439023521|4.0|I resisted reading this for quite some time, finding it hard to understand why there was such a huge fan following in a book that glorifies people killing each other in an arena. Once I gave in and started reading it, however, I understood this book's appeal. The writing is fantastic and pulls you in- it's the first book in awhile since the Harry Potter series that I felt gripped by to the point of trying to sneak some extra reading time in while my son was brushing his teeth for two minutes. :) Certainly the concept of throwing kids into an arena to kill each other is horrifying, but once I bought into the fact that a life with that kind of brutality is the all the characters in the book have really known I embraced the \\"teenage version of the Running Man\\" concept and routed for certain characters like everyone else. The main character is rather irritating, though, because she seems rather lacking in self reflection and quite content to use people when it's convenient. She is also the most clueless person when it comes to love and friendship and I wanted to smack her whenever she had a five minute inner monologue about Peeta's true intentions. Overall, however, it was unique, fast-paced, riveting, and unnerving. I see why the popularity ensued.
B008FOB124|5.0|After about my third listen to this album, I'm finding myself unable to stop.<br />It is amazing, in fact I would say better than most of their albums as it meets the mark in many aspects, and exceeds in others.<br /><br />Firstly all of the songs are really well done, and have all the elegant compositional hooks and interesting rhythms you would expect from a Dead Can Dance album, from lush strings to epic horn phrases that seem to lift you as you hear Brandon Perry croon.<br /><br />My favorite songs (so far) are the \\"Children of the Sun,\\" an incredible Perry song, \\"Agape,\\" a hypnotic middle-eastern dance song sung by Lisa Gerrard, and \\"Amnesia,\\" which I think reminds me of the Brandon Perry of the pre-\\"Into the Labyrinth,\\" years. Those are just my favorites. The rest of the album is gorgeous.<br /><br />This album reminds me in many ways of their 1985 released Spleen and Ideal album, and I would even dare say it's better as the sound quality of Anastasis is very good. And yet still the elements that I enjoyed from their later albums in the 90's are apparent such as the complex primal rhythms. \\"Kiko,\\" in that manner is quite a trip.<br /><br />All in all an Excellent album! I'm happy they released it.
B003ZD9DUC|5.0|Great movie, always enjoy it, must of seen this 5 or so times now(at least). The Blu-ray resolution is not improved to standards of a recent production but it's not grainy like some older movies that are released as blu-ray. Audio is clean DTS-HD. Waiting patiently for Thunderdome to come out in Blu-ray!!!

1476712042|5.0|***ARC received by Simon & Schuster for review***<br /><br />\\"You're trying to save him, and he's hoping you can.  You two are a disaster.\\"<br />I smiled at the ceiling.  \\"It doesn't matter what or why it is.  When it's good, Kara...it's beautiful.\\"<br /><br />This quote describes Beautiful Disaster perfectly!  I had read a couple of good reviews about this book and when I saw Beautiful Disaster on NetGalley a couple of weeks ago, I decided to get it and planned to squeeze it my reading list sometime in the next couple of months.  But after reading a particular review by Debbie  at I Heart YA Books, I just simply had to put all of my other books aside and I HAD to read it right away!  I started reading this book around 11:30pm and I stayed up until 2:30am reading half of the book (even though I had to wake up at 5:30 the next morning) and finishing the whole thing the next night.  So yes, this book was simply unputdownable. (Is that a word?)<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that this book is not perfect and at times it was a bit of a disaster but that's why I loved it so much.  Travis and Abby were two very flawed characters with a lot of issues to work through.  For some reason these always become my favorite types of characters.  To me, it makes it even more special to see them grow and change and I feel like the payoff is even bigger at the end.  I know a lot of people really didn't like Travis but I absolutely and completely LOVED him, everything about him!  The good and the bad.  Yes, he can be a jerk and he has one hell of a temper and some major jealousy issues but all of these flaws just made him even more realistic to me.  Don't worry because he doesn't stay that way throughout the whole book.  Once he meets Abby he slowly starts changing, sometimes for the better, sometimes not.  But the important thing to me is that he tries to be a better person for Abby.  There is another character in this book, Parker, who is somewhat a love interest to Abby.  He was pretty much perfect:  good looking, rich, nice, good manners, Harvard-bound...and I absolutely could not stand him!  He was such a bore.  Maybe it's just me and maybe I'm not right in the head but I like reading about the messed up characters.  The more screwed up they are, the better I like them.  (Most of the time)<br /><br />Abby was a very complex character.  She has a shady past and has worked hard to move on from it.  But from the moment she meets Travis, she can't help but feel drawn to him.  Don't worry; this isn't one of those insta-love stories.  In fact, it's the completely opposite.  It's one of those almost<br />excruciating but awesome slow build-ups that pushes them together one moment only to have them ripped apart the next.  Abby and Travis have such a complicated and messed up friendship and their relationship is even more messed up.  Just like the quote above says, when things are good between them it was such a beautiful thing.  But when things went bad, it was definitely disastrous.  At first, I really liked Abby because she was really tough and she would stand up to herself to Travis and didn't take any of his bullshit.  But the closer they got, and the more blurry the line between friendship and romance got, she did some very stupid things which made me want to reach into the book and slap her a couple of times. (Maybe more than a couple)<br /><br />It's official!  I found my new favorite category:  New Adult!  I mostly read YA (hence the blog name) and as much as I love them I sometimes feel like there is something missing.  Well I found out what that was: sex!  This is another thing that adds a realistic element to the story.  I don't know why but it always bugs me when couples in YA wait until the third book to finally have sex.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not against waiting and I definitely love the sexual tension until then, but what is it about the third book that makes it ok then?  The relationship between Travis and Abby is scorchinghot without being graphic or inappropriate.  It's also such a refreshing change to move away from the high school setting (and drama).  All of these things including the language make it so much more real to me.<br /><br />The plot definitely took a couple of crazy turns but overall, I absolutely fell in love with this book!  The only thing that I didn't like about the book was that Travis has this nickname for Abby: Pigeon or Pidge.  It briefly gets explained why he gave her that nickname although it didn't really make sense (to me).  I mentally programmed my brain to just read `Abby\\" every time the word Pigeon came out.  I also loved Shepley and America who are Travis and Abby's best friends (and also a couple). Travis and Abby are one of my new favorite couples and Beautiful Disaster has made it into my top 10 all-time favorite books.  I read on the author's blog that she is writing a companion to this book, Walking Disaster which is basically this story but told from Travis's POV!  Travis has some serious issues and I can't wait to get inside his head.  Counting down the days until we get to read a new perspective on Travis on Abby.<br /><br />Due to the content and language of this book, it is recommended for ages 17+. (New Adult)  Beautiful Disaster is not for everyone.  I have seen some pretty harsh reviews for this book and it looks like it's one of those books you are either gonna LOVE or HATE.  It's raw and intense and very emotional and it tackles some pretty serious issues.  Whether you love it or not, one thing is clear:  everyone is talking about Beautiful Disaster!  Read it and make up your own decision about it instead of staying away from it because of the bad reviews.<br /><br />5 out of 5 very sparkly stars!!!  A MUST-read!<br /><br />Some of my favorite non-spoiler quotes from Beautiful Disaster:<br />-\\"You're only making it worse by brushing him off.  He's not used to that.\\"<br />\\"What do you suggest I do?  Sleep with him?\\"<br />America shrugged.  \\"It'll save time.\\"<br /><br />-He leaned in close and whispered in my ear.  \\"I don't wanna sleep with you, Pidge. I like you too much.\\"<br />He walked past me to the bathroom, and I stood, stunned.<br />Kara's words replayed in my mind.  Travis Maddox slept with everyone; I couldn't help but feel deficient in some way knowing he had no desire to even try to sleep with me.<br /><br />-I clinked my bottle against his.  \\"To being the only girl a guy with no standards doesn't want to sleep with.\\" I said, taking a swig.<br />\\"Are you serious?\\" he asked, pulling the bottle from my mouth.

I thought about throwing you over my couch fifty different ways, but I haven't because I don't see you that way anymore.  It's not that I'm not attracted to you, I just think you're better than that.\\"<br /><br />-\\"Abs?\\" What are you a workout video?\\" he sneered.<br />\\"Pigeon?\\" I said with the same amount of disdain.  \\"An annoying bird that craps all over the sidewalk?\\"<br /><br />-I yanked his shirt over his head, fumbling in the dark with his belt buckle.

It's also such a refreshing change to move away from the high school setting (and drama).  All of these things including the language make it so much more real to me.<br /><br />The plot definitely took a couple of crazy turns but overall, I absolutely fell in love with this book!  The only thing that I didn't like about the book was that Travis has this nickname for Abby: Pigeon or Pidge.  It briefly gets explained why he gave her that nickname although it didn't really make sense (to me).  I mentally programmed my brain to just read `Abby\\" every time the word Pigeon came out.  I also loved Shepley and America who are Travis and Abby's best friends (and also a couple). Travis and Abby are one of my new favorite couples and Beautiful Disaster has made it into my top 10 all-time favorite books.  I read on the author's blog that she is writing a companion to this book, Walking Disaster which is basically this story but told from Travis's POV!  Travis has some serious issues and I can't wait to get inside his head.  Counting down the days until we get to read a new perspective on Travis on Abby.<br /><br />Due to the content and language of this book, it is recommended for ages 17+.

0380807343|4.0|Shouldn't have been surprised since this is a Neil Gaiman book, but I did not anticipate how creepy this book turned out to be. I'm unable to look at dolls with button eyes without feeling a bit unnerved now. Still, if you enjoy young adult darker tales, this is one not to miss. I was horribly creeped out and yet could not stop turning the pages to find out how things would unfold. I hear the movie is just as good but takes a more \\"fairy tale\\" approach, in which case I'm glad I read the book first to experience the author's original darker vision.
030758836X|5.0|Its been a while since I have been truly enthusiastic about a book.  People are going to love this book and people are going to hate it but at least its fresh and has some things to say while being an interesting read.  It is twisty and sick and fun. If you have been in or know somebody in a toxic relationship it may resonate with you more than you care to admit.  The way it ends is going to displease some readers but it does have an ending and personally I really liked it.  I read it in one long delicious sitting.  I have read flynn's other books.  Didn't care for Dark Places, liked Sharp Objects, but this is by far her best.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|I would not recommend this series to anyone who loves literature and reading. For that matter, I would not recommend these books to anyone with a brain. I could probably write a dissertation on why, but I will keep this a brief bulleted summary.<br /><br />1.The sex scenes became annoying before I even finished the first book. At best, I skimmed through them to make sure I didn't miss anything important for the rest of the series.<br /><br />2.Something about all of the allusions bothered me. I'm not sure if I felt that James used way too many allusions, or that they didn't work because she forced them into the text. Maybe she did this to try to increase the intellectual level of the book. I don't know, but I found them annoying as well.<br /><br />3.Anastasia Steele is NOT a heroine! All through the book James wants us to believe that Ana is a strong woman because she holds her ground with Christian. Sorry she's no Jane Eyre and Christian is no Rochester. I would never be with a man who constantly referred to me as a possession. Even in the end I'm not convinced that this was love, more of an obsession.<br /><br />4.The end is unrealistic and anti-climactic. The book would have been far more thought provoking if Christian ended up killing himself when he thinks Ana is taking money out of the bank to leave him. I still would not have liked the books, but maybe we could have dissected it as another modern day Romeo and Juliet tragic ending.<br /><br />I DO NOT recommend this book to ANY serious literature lovers!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Blake Crouch continues to cement his reputation as the New Grand Master of stories that will scare the living crap out of you.  His latest, PINES, picks up where the best of his earlier thrillers leave off, most notably 2011's chilling RUN.  As in that nerve jangling masterpiece, a baffled protagonist finds himself the target of a society gone insane, and must run for his life.  In PINES, Secret Service Agent Ethan Burke goes to the remote and blissful little Idaho village of Wayward Pines in search of two missing agents.  But something is way out of kilter in Wayward Pines.  Like Shangri La in reverse, or perhaps Santa Mira after the Pod People take over, the town falls upon Burke like an avalanche, and he must either escape or share the fate of his fellow agents.  As always, Crouch's crisp descriptions, realistic dialogue, and urgent pacing draw the reader along like an icy hand that won't let go.  Highly recommended.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Ethan Burke, a Secret service agent is sent to Wayward Pines to investigate the disappearance of two other agents that have disappeared without a trace. On his way there, there is a car accident and his partner is killed and Ethan is taken to a hospital. Then things start turning weird for Ethan. He can't seem to get his belongings returned (including ID and money). He has terrible headaches and although people are friendly enough, he can't seem to get the assistance he wants. Soon, he finds out that he can't leave town!<br /><br />When I began reading this story my first thoughts were of \\"The Twilight Zone\\" and then \\"The Prisoner\\" (both TV shows that I enjoyed watching). Instantly, I tried to figure out what was going on, and my guesses were nowhere near the truth. The more Ethan struggled with his pan and trying to escape, the more twists and turns made it almost impossible to figure out what was going on. Is this a mystery, suspense, horror or science fiction? How knows but it certainly grabbled my attention. Yes, the ending was a little strange and not what I was expecting, but still enjoyable enough that I couldn't put the book down (I mean my e-reader). It's right up there with Abandon, Run and Snowbound!

B0001HLVS2|5.0|Final recommendation first: This is a good movie. Possibly the best of the Napoleonic period, navy movies -ever (full stop, no further qualifications)<br /><br />Now for the review:<br /><br />Once upon a time His Majesty's Royal Navy had the following officer ranks: Midshipman, usually a child or very young boy whose main job was to learn the seafaring craft. His battle station would normally be amidships, where he would best be able to repeat the orders of the Captain.<br />Lieutenant - a Midshipman who has passed his examination or by heroic action been advanced to permanent rank. A lieutenant was generally considered to be able to perform any duties normally assigned to a Naval Officer.<br />Captain, or Post Captain. Once you made \\"Post\\" you were deemed fitted to command a ship, note that in this case the term `Ship' means more than a big boat. As in a ship rigged or ship or the line.<br />Once you made Post, all you had to do was live long enough and you could expect to make the final rank: Admiral. As an Admiral, you could be expected to command fleets or similar major shore commands.<br /><br />A Lieutenant, placed in command of a smaller ship, such as a small frigate, would be a Lieutenant (Commanding). He would have over-all charge of the ship and final responsibility as regards to her mission and general state of readiness. The ships master or Sailing Master was the person charged with the navigation and general sailing of the ship. Where the Admiralty felt that the Lieutenant (Commanding) was an accomplished sailor, he would be titled as Master and Commander.<br /><br />With that as background, we have \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey, Master and Commander of his favorite ship - HMS Surprise (variously a 5th rate or 6th rate frigate rating 28 guns) wherein, many years before he had first served as midshipman. Indeed, the HMS Surprise still caries his initials carved into the top of the mainmast where he had been \\"masted\\" as punishment.<br /><br />Serving along side of Lieutenant (Master and Commander) Aubry is best friend and ships surgeon, Stephen Maturin.  The Ship's mission is to hunt down and destroy the American built, French ship the Acheron (44 guns and at least a 3rd rate ship). The French ship is larger, faster and almost magically better informed about the Surprise. None of these facts would have mattered to the British Admiralty. The Admiralty would have gladly broken Lucky Jack and left him beached, with no paying commission as they all knew that HM's frigates never lost in single ship actions.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Acheron would open the movie by dealing a hugely destructive and unanswered broadside to the surprised, Surprise.  The Acheron would then sail off to the far side of the world: Around the Horn and into the Pacific. The Surprise would be left to make and, mend before, acting in excess of her orders begin the hard, life threatening trek in the wake of the Acheron. Meantime there would remain the problem of how the little Surprise would succeed her next meeting.<br /><br />So much for the plot<br /><br />The Aubrey Maturin books by Patrick O' Brian are among the true classics of Naval Literature. I have read them all at least twice, heard them on CD or tape at least as many times, and will likely do the same again. I fully agree with those would compare his style to Jane Austin's with the important difference that O'Brian has things happen and does not need the extra 200 pages to get to them.<br /><br />Jack Aubry and Horatio Hornblower would have enjoyed each others company. O'Brian's writing  however is a far more nuanced and complex than Forester's.<br /><br />Master and Command the Movie, is a mash up of several of the early Aubrey, Maturin novels. This may offend the true literary loyalist, for me it was not a problem. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Lucky Jack. This is the same performance he gives in Gladiator and Robin Hood, never mind it works here. Paul Bettany, could have been born to play Steven Maturin. He is physically, mentally and otherwise the right foil and true friend to Crowe's Aubrey.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have ever had about this movie is that it so completely captures the seagoing aspects of the O'Brian Novels that there is no need for a sequel. Of late I am going to pin my hopes on the fact that this movie only scratches the surface of the many faces of Dr. Maturin, Physician, Naturalist and not portrayed here, Spy! Further, Lucky Jack is a man of many problems dealing with life ashore. Between a few love affairs too many, bad political and financial judgments there is much left in the literary series that could be made into more Aubrey/Maturin movies.<br /><br />Movie makers are you listening?n to play Steven Maturin.

B007USWCXS|5.0|What a strange strange enjoyable film. This was one of weirdest films I have watched in a very long time, and yet it is one of the more memorable.<br /><br />This is a live action film; the cover art suggests that this film might be animated. It is in French with English subtitles. The film opens with this 1950's French Film Noir feel. Two shoe shines are standing at the exit to a train station. People walk by, but nobody wants their shoes shined. Finally a man with a brief case handcuffed to his wrist (very 1950's looking) stops to have his shoes shined. Two other men stop and watch him. The man pays for his shine, runs out of the train station and is killed off camera. The older man says, I'm glad he paid for his shoe shine. All in a deadpan look at the camera.<br /><br />The film is full of anachronisms, 1950's and 60's cars and clothes, in modern day Le Havre a very busy port city in the north of France. Some people wear old clothes, over coats and 1950's styles, others wear modern clothes. The film is a character study. As the film progresses, I got involved with each character, I cared about what happened to them. The acting was annoying at first; people appeared to read their lines to the camera without emotion. But as the story unfolded, this became a charming quirk of the film.<br /><br />This is one of those wonderful simple but complex art house films. I was charmed and very happy that I watched this film.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I've always wanted to check out this series.  It's been more an issue of time - once it got rolling I missed too many episodes to keep up.  When a friend loaned me the first season, I instantly got addicted.  Yes, this plotline is rife with issues of morality, social consciousness and even karma.<br /><br />What hit me the hardest is the show's ability to tackle those subjects in a true to life form for TODAY's society.  The drug using youth culture looks at meth in much the same way that children of the 70's and 80's looked at weed or coke - as recreation.  Gilligan and Cranston decided early on not to beat the drum of self-restraint and accountability related to the drug culture, but to characterize the dark alley nature of the trade so that all ages can relate to its dire pitfalls - because drug use after all has never really changed - only the menu items have.<br /><br />And that helps us focus on Cranston's Walter White and his supreme conflict of cobbling together a nest egg for his family for when he's gone.  It's implied but you always get the ironic sense that White feels an invincibility, ever so fleeting in the most difficult of times (i.e. as a hostage of Tuko...).  And that he attaches as much importance to his mentorship of Aaron Paul's Jesse character as he does to the \\"moral high ground\\" of providing for his family.<br /><br />This show has places to go, and each episode injects a bit more empathy and hope for White.  In spite of his obvious flawed choices, he seems to be trying to do the right thing for the given circumstances.  You have a prevailing sense (or maybe wish) of one thing - he and Jesse will somehow come out on the right side of the moral conflict.  If and how he gets there will be the big excitement of this series.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Bottom line first: One of my all time favorite movies  Inventive Beautiful<br />Beatles fans, prepare to have some of your favorite songs taken over by new artists and new interpretations.<br /><br />As of this writing the votes for this movie are about 4 to one heavily (5 and 4 stars versus 1, 2 or 3) in favor of this movie. Allowing for a fair number of negative votes that are based on technical problems and \\"little darling it's clear\\" most people are very happy they bought: Across the Universe.<br /><br />The basic plot revolves around a British ship welder Jude (Jim Sturges) who leaves home to find his American Dad.  Once he does he also finds himself; 1) falling in love with American student Lucy (Evan Rachael Wood) and 2.) on the periphery of the Viet Nam anti war movement. Lucy's first love will die in that war and her response will be to slowly shift from being a middle class average girl to a motivated activist. He is apolitical and only wants to enjoy life and develop his nascent artistic skills.<br /><br />Along the way they will interact with a number of people ranging from Sadie (Diana Fuchs) a brilliant stand in for Janis Joplin and Jo Jo (Martin Luther McCoy) clearly playing guitarist Jimmy Hendricks. There is a need for so much musical power.<br /><br />Director and co writer Julie Taymor envisioned a romantic, musical retelling of the 1960's as experienced in the counter-culture world of New York city. She draws heavily from the Beatles catalog but stages each song such that you will never again hear or think of them the same.<br /><br />When Evan Wood sings: If I fell in Love - she imparts far more longing and depth of emotion than the young Beatles could have imagined. On the other extreme, For the Benefit of Mr. Kite: with Eddie Izzard is way more playful, trippy and fun then you will ever again hear.<br /><br />Not only does Joe Cocker take total and permanent possession of Come Together, but the full package of the musical backup, the stunning camera work and the choreography elevate this into an entire tightly constructed narrative.<br /><br />There are several more songs and staging in this move that lifted me, moved me, and shook me. I will never again hear Strawberry Fields, without seeing this movie. The sequence around Hey Jude is never less than beautiful, even the bucket drummer (anyone know who he is?) makes me smile after at least 6 viewings.<br /><br />The politics here are liberal, so some folks may feel obligated to hate it or love it. To me the politics are background. Even so there are some very powerful and moving images. The I Need You/Draft Board sequence is eerie, moving, humorous and about ten other things, making this hard to view if you are political, left or right.<br /><br />Normally, I do not care about two-disk sets. Because Julie Taymor's vision is so central to this movie; and because of the talent and creativity in this movie; the extra material is worth the few extra dollars to get this version.<br /><br />To quote the Beatles: \\"relax and float down stream\\", this is a beautiful movie. Expect to play it often.camera work and the choreography elevate this into an entire tightly constructed narrative.<br /><br />There are several more songs and staging in this move that lifted me, moved me, and shook me.

B0084IG8TM|4.0|I read the book first and I think it was interpreted very well on screen. When I first saw the previews for this movie,I knew nothing about The Hunger Games Trilogy but was disturbed at the concept of fighting young people to their death for the entertainment of the elite. I have read the 1st and 2nd parts of the trilogy and have now seen the movie and I think there is an important message being communicated here. We need to hold the puppet masters, our elected officials and the global banking cartels feet to the fire now or The Hunger Games could very well be our childrens and grandchildrens future. Do things  really have to disentegrate further before action is taken by the mass population to implement change in this worlwide corrupt regime? The most moving part of the book and movie is when Catniss lays the flowers over Rue's body. It was portrayed perfectly on screen. Read the book, watch the movie, and REALLY think about the future of your children and their childrens generation. I cant wait for the next movie to come out!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|good game it really is good I cant wait to play some more of this I good graphics. awesome. lot of people
1934030597|5.0|The book is thorough and humorous.  I have used it quite a bit in the short time I've had it.  Other books I've purchased or looked at have photographs as illustrations. Sometimes photos are really good but sometime--because the location of the work makes angles difficult, or because of poor lighting or photography--you cannot see the illustration clearly.  The drawings in the Zinn book are clear and easy to understand.

B007Q0OV6Q|2.0|What is The Lego Group thinking here?  $50 for a 234 part Advent Calendar?  Star Wars or not, that is really overpriced.  It is a $10 increase over last year, which was expensive enough as it was.  This is over 21 cents a part, and they are small parts at that.  Darth Maul Santa is of course cool, but this needs to be 30% off before it becomes interesting.<br /><br />As for the set itself, looking at the various parts:<br /><br />1. Several minifigs.  You have Darth Maul Santa, clearly the highlight of the set.  You also have a black super-battle droid, several generic troopers on both sides, a basic battle droid, a Gungan, and of course R2 snowman, another cool addition.<br /><br />2. Several ships.  It continues to amaze me how you can have the same basic ship in Lego in so many different sizes.  You have Darth Maul's Sith Infiltrator, a Naboo Starfighter, a Star Destroyer, an AT-AT walker, and a few others.<br /><br />Is the whole thing rather cool?  Yes...  for $29 this would be a no-brainer all day long.  For $49, it is simply too expensive for what comes in the kit.

(The Graveyard Book and Coraline) Both of which were completely excellent and far surpassed my expectations going into reading them.

Like when I read Chabon or Anne Michaels, I found myself reading phrases, sentences or paragraphs over and over just to savor the beauty of the prose. The story line is pretty complex, even for Murakami, so this one isn't for the uninitiated. But isn't that the fun of his novels anyway: not knowing where you're going, how you'll get there, but guaranteed that delicious journey.

B005K17RU0|4.0|Really like the map. Good graphics. Found out it is better to use a zip code to pin point a location. It is more accurate. Radar is more up to the minute too.
B007STBUIW|5.0|What a classic!  The movie that kept us on the beach, has resurfaced once again in Blu Ray form!  The detail is perfect, and the colors are so rich.  For those of you who have been watching even the 30th anniversary collection edition, there is no compare!  The visual scope of this movie is stunning in this format, and Universal has taken great steps to ensure it is top of the line in the restoration process.  Spielberg is even pround and he tells you so!  I just can't tell you how good it looks.  You have to see it for yourself!  There really hasn't been anything new in terms of the special features in this version, other than the \\"Shark is Still Working\\" special feature that should have been released on it's own years ago!  It is a very good retrospective on the movie, not to mention adding a lot to the otherwise known \\"Making of Jaws\\" that is once again included.  \\"The Shark is Still Working\\" brings more of the human element on the making of the movie, and actually shows more than the \\"Making of\\" feature in some respects.  It brings in people such as the actor who plays Sean Brody, as well as more location video and pictures.  It also gets more in-depth in some respects.  And none other than Martin Brody himself narrates it!  I was very impressed.  The \\"Making of Jaws\\" is also a good feature, but I still like the orginal, watered down, version of that feature which appears on the 25th anniversary edition.  Less talk, more action.  The other feature on the Blu Ray that is cool is the \\"From the Set\\" feature, which was the orginal \\"behind the scenes\\" shot in 1974.  Other features on the Blu Ray include production photos, the marketing of Jaws, Jaws Phenonemon, and trailer, all which were on previous versions.  I just wish there was a Directors Commentary, or at least someone's commentary!  That would've been the ideal package for me!  I'm a \\"behind the scenes\\" type of viewer, especially to the classics, but the main meat of this whole thing is the actual movie itself.  It is a classic, now restored to the upmost quality of sound and video resolution!  Does it make the shark look more fake?  No.  But it does bring you in and grip you like it always did, but now with a little more intensity.  Enjoy... I did, and will continue...
B008IYOEZM|3.0|Some spoilers!<br /><br />I really love Dexter and, like many other reviewers, have been a fan since the first season. I think that seasons 1-5 are all rated 5-stars and that the entire cast is great, especially MC Hall, who displays some of the most intense acting chops of any actor, ever. The writing of the previous 5 seasons has painted a vivid picture of Dexter and his fellow characters, and we know them well. The various antagonists have always been written brilliantly and the actors chosen have been outstanding in their roles (I'm talking to you, Trinity!).<br /><br />I didn't feel quite as strongly in love with Season 6. While I agree that the show's regular cast members maintained their 10-star acting performances (J Carpenter!!), and I loved the Brother Sam storyline and Quinn's meltdown, I thought that there were two problems with this season:<br /><br />1. Writing quality. What the HECK was this season about, really? Was it about Dexter and God? Dexter and the Doomsday Killer? Dexter trying to exorcise everyone of their Dark Passengers, like some quixotic archangel? Dexter going crazy (hello, Rudy, I missed you)? Dexter skipping work and being too busy to spend time with his son? Dexter the Amateur, making mistakes left and right (having poison gas reaction, still attempt to get bad guy -or- oops, someone took my son!)? Why was Dex sometimes written as a bit of an airhead, instead of being focused and precise? Was it an attempt to show his personal battle of Good v Evil? If so, I had too many \\"wait, what?\\" moments (random Midwest bathroom sex with a stranger) to fully appreciate that particular storyline.<br /><br />And the most creepy and eyeroll-inducing aspect of the season... Deb tacitly being given permission to be in love with Dexter, regardless of their lifelong brother/sister relationship, by her one-note shrink. Ugh. I hope that was just a momentary lapse that will be ignored (like Rita's kids) in Season 7.<br /><br />2. Colin Hanks was, to me, aconfusing choice of an actor for such a major role on the show. I think I understand the premise behind the choice; namely, they wanted an actor who was able to look innocent and gullible so that he could ultimately have the audience bamboozled. Instead, this audience-member was bamboozled by the fact that they chose an actor who couldn't live up to the role and reputation of a Dexter foe. In other words, I thought young Hanks was a dud. Sorry, but I have to agree with other reviewers who've said the same thing. I also think that Edward James Olmos was under-used.<br /><br />In all, I think that this season was \\"okay\\", but hope the writers stop trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to the characters - especially Dexter, who should be developed as a better, and more intense, main character instead of going backwards. However, as usual, I still can't wait for the next season to start!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|On a scale to 1 to 10, I would give it a 10 . It's my favorite game. Half Brick's games get better and better.<br />I hope they come out with another good game.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Nice app. The pollen reports ate helpful for my husband and his allergies. Nice to see precipitation percentages too. The maps aren't bad but I do wish they were more up to the minute.

B003B0D2QU|5.0|Aside from learning about the amazing circumstances and journey Barack Obama has taken to lead him to be our president, I was totally struck by what a skilled writer he is.  It was shocking how talented he is.  After he finishes his second term, he can always be a full time author.  Absolutely, positively a must read.  Especially for all the ignorant haters.  Maybe they could have someone read it to them. haha

B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is my go-to movie when I just need to laugh. There's nothing offensive, it's just feel good funny and great for all ages. No \\"cover-the-eyes\\" moments for kids, and the comedy is mature and dynamic enough for adults to enjoy. I suggest after your first viewing, take the time to watch a second time to notice each and every awesome details of the minions. Highly recommended.
B001992NUQ|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said except that for the 10 year anniversary it is awesome to see a movie that holds up. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton do such an awesome job of bringing this story to life, and the chaotic message that underscores this movie is just as important today as it was when the movie came out.<br /><br />I always feel like a bit of a sucker when I buy DVD's or Blue-Rays now, because I am a Netflix member and there's digital content available (through legal channels!) but this is one movie I am glad I have a hard copy of. I remember leaving the theater when it came out and thinking - man, what have they done?<br /><br />10 years later, I feel the same way when I pop it in the PS3. Just awesome.
B0061TQBRK|5.0|This is a good album, probably the best stuff by this band. It grows on you too. I bought it on iTunes but one of the tracks only played halfway through, so I downloaded it elsewhere to enjoy it in higher quality ;). Excellent music.
B005LAIGQE|1.0|This is NOT a combo pack! There is 1 disc included, with the Blue Ray on one side and the DVD on the other. Besides that one side of the disc is bound to get destroyed, the main purpose of getting a combo pack is because people have both Blue Ray and DVD players. This \\"Combo Pack\\" will do you no good when your machines are in two different locations because the destributor didn't want to spring the extra nickel for another disc. Rest easy though, I'm sure they'll tell you it's for the \\"environment\\"; as they explore every possible avenue to get the most money out of you
1476712042|5.0|I purchased this book based on the wonderful reviews.  I have to say this book did not disapoint me. The violence was part of the book that I'm not sure was necessary, but I have to say I LOVED this book. The charter development was enought to draw you in but not to much so you got borred.  This is still ranked #1 out of 15 reads this summer so far.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't help but notice all the negative reviews, and I just don't understand why. I found this book to be a wonderful little excape from the realities of life. Not to mention it's really sexy! I can't honestly say my man enjoyed me reading this book in fact encouraged me to read the other two. I not much of a reader of fiction much less love story's, but I'm definitely a freak! By all means if you feel like getting hot and bothered for your man when he comes in from work..... Well get to reading!! Trust me he will thank the author personally if he could...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to find what you are looking for...love all the different translations.  very happy with the book marks and reading plans as well. thank you for this wonderful product.  had it on my phone now on my kindle.
B007G5O3K0|3.0|Morten still has that soaring voice and uses his falsetto to good effect. The good songs are the opening two tracks especially. I love the 'who am I today' section of 'keep the sun away', it is extremely melodic and beautiful. The first track also has a memorable chorus with lovely vocal sections. The last track; the title track is also a gorgeous ballad, with nice piano and subtle synths in the background. Many other tracks are also nice, and the Pet shop boys self penned track, shows their skills.<br />Three stars though are for four tracks I feel drags the album down. 'Burn money burn' and 'when I reached the moon' are boring to me. But the chorus for 'I'm the one' is frightfully shallow and modern, as is the whole of the awful 'just believe it'. These sound like boy band songs to me and have no place on a Harket album.<br />Still, recommended to fans, who I'm sure will love it, but not going to grab the attention of anyone else.
0425263908|5.0|If you liked fifity shades of gray you should read this! I actually thought this was better written then that triology.  I enjoyed it so much I pre-ordered the next book in the series due out in December.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wasn't sure what I would find when I ordered the Hunger Games 3 book series.  Were these books really for me?  I was extremely pleased.  There was  excitement in each book and I had a hard time putting them down.  Catching Fire built off of book one and made me look forward to book three.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun game. Hate the ads, but still like the app. classic game and helps pass the time on lunch breaks.
B008602KQI|1.0|I've never written a review before, but feel compelled to do so as a way to ease the pain after wasting 2 hours of my life watching this movie.<br /><br />I guess I'll begin by saying I've read the books, so I wanted this movie to be good. I understand that you need to cut corners in the story to adapt a book to a movie, but this movie feels like someone skimmed through the cliff notes and then diluted those into a one paragraph summary from which to shoot this movie<br />.<br />I don't think I've ever uttered the words character development seriously before and it would seem like the director and I have that in common at least. I slogged through 2 hours of this film and the only change in character I noticed is that Katniss brushed Peeta's hand away at the beginning and held it at the end. Why is her mom a mess? Why is her hunting partner back in the district all bummed out? Why does Cinna like her? If I hadn't read the book, every single character in this movie would have no depth or reason for doing what they do. I get that most people who wanted to see this movie read at least one of the books, but it shouldn't be a prerequisite to be able to understand the plot, a movie should be able to stand on its own, especially at 2 hours long.<br /><br />The acting left something to be desired, but at this point I'm not convinced the actors can be held at fault since there doesn't seem to be much substance to what they were given to work with. As a side note, isn't Katniss a little soft looking to be from such a poverty stricken region where the inhabitants have a tradition of dying from malnutrition? Just sayin'.<br /><br />The camera style/shooting was garbage as well but at this point I think I've conveyed my utter disdain for this production and a weight has been lifted from my soul. 1/10, the end!
0071752854|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone.  It explains of how your communications are recieved by your target's brain and what you can do to guide the  the conversation.  This works in social situations as well as business meetings.  Very enlightening.

B004ISVH6G|4.0|Been a fan for years, actually got to see John at a small venue in Birmingham called WorkPlay.

John is back at his Rock Roots, many people undervalue his ability on straight up Rock --- DON\\"T UNDERESTIMATE JOHN WAIT----<br /> Buy this record!!
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|John Carter was recommended by a friend.  My kids 7 and 3 both loved it and asked to watch it over and over again for the 48 hours we had it.  Lots of action, and enough to keep my kids interested.  [[ASIN:B0088RQ4X4 John Carter]]
B000B589JI|4.0|It is a bit bigger than I thought, which is ok since it will hold more fluid than I thought.  It would be nice to have the option to easily remove the dangly stuff on the top (clip, flint screw tool, etc) but overall it should do the job.
0062197258|1.0|I am an avid reader and love to find an interesting new author. I could not get very far in this book. I did not like the flipping back and forth between years. I did not like the main character and her language was atrocious.<br />Worst book I have tried to read in years.
0307730697|5.0|I read a lot and this was the best book I have read in a while. If you can get thru this book without choking up at the end (even though you already know the outcome), you have no heart. It is just an amazing story.
B008XCF7Y6|4.0|Stock storyline and characters, great animation and action scenes, but be aware there's nudity. It's consistent with the other SST movies, but I wasn't prepared for it in a cartoon. This definitely isn't for kids.
B0063IH60K|5.0|can't go wrong with simple and free... what more can you ask for... for free. many options and User friendly
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|After fighting with this stabilizer for week I finally returned it. I could never get my Sony NEX-7 properly balanced causing a horrible side to side swing.  I watched every video and read every blog I could find about balancing this thing and in the end just could not make it work.  It's possible my camera was to light weight but I read about others who have used a NEX-7.  The final nail in the coffin was after I read that people have to often re-balance after just sitting this device down.  I am glad others have had good luck with this device, it's a good price in comparison to the competition but just did not work for me.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Loving the amount of levels and sections. The graphics are great. This is visually and mentally fun. I'm loving the various themes.
B005FITILO|5.0|Judging from the bad reviews, people went in expecting \\"Bridesmaids\\" and instead got \\"There Will Be Blood\\".  Looks like the marketing dept failed, yet again, by portraying a movie as something it's not.  They sell a movie like it's a mainstream popcorn flick to get the butts in the seats, but then many of those butts are understandably pissed that it's not the formulaic comfortable feel-good comedy they were looking for.  This backfires because it creates instant bad word of mouth, rather than the slow, building, good word of mouth that happens when a film isn't hyped the wrong way and is allowed to find its audience.  So sad that the movie business just can't work that way anymore.  If \\"Chinatown\\" had come out now, the idiots in the marketing dept would have tried to make the commercials look like \\"Basic Instinct.\\"  Fools.  As far as the movie goes, it's spectacular. It's a beautiful, dark, little character study.  And I HATED \\"Juno\\" and wasn't expecting much from this but was so happily surprised.  Give it a fair chance. Keep in mind that it's not a raunchy, uproarious comedy, and that if you're in the wrong mood the movie can be depressing.  But in the right mood, the movie's like a shot of some damn fine smoky bourbon.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Downton Abbey is already close to an institution as the most popular costume drama for about 30 years coming out of the UK which makes something of a speciality of this sort of thing. So far we have two series, with a third promised which will take us up to the 1920s with doubtless more to come. This DVD set covers the first two series, with 16 episodes, 7 from the first series and 8 from the second and the Christmas special.<br /><br />The first series covered the period from 1912, just after the sinking of the Titanic, up to the start of the first world war in 1914 and much of the story line is about the matchmaking within the Crawley family where financial and social influences have a major bearing. Of course the interaction between the family and those who serve them `below stairs' is a continual contributor to the excellent story lines. The second series picks up two years on from the first series in 1916, in the middle of World War 1. Downton Abbey has been converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen and the action covers the period from the Battle of the Somme up to the end of the war. The Christmas Special is post the first world war and includes a dramatic trial. In both series topical events of the period, political, economic and military are covered.<br /><br />There are many superb individual performances but mention must be made of Maggie Smith. What a stroke of genius to cast her as Violet. She dominates every scene she appears in and often has some very funny lines.<br /><br />This box set will appeal to viewers who may have missed out first time round and also to the many who enjoyed this superb production and will want to revisit it.  Roll on Series 3!
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn  is a lit powder keg.  Flynn writes a tight plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Just when you start to think you know what really happened to Amy, it all changes on you.  After Amy disappears, we get two conflicting accounts of Nick and Amy's marriage.  The narration switches between Nick's inner monologue and Amy's diary.  Nick proclaims his innocence even as the evidence starts to stack up against him.  And Amy's diary entries may prove to be the most damning of it all.  But everything is not always what it seems and Flynn twists and turns the plot until the very end.<br /><br />However, I didn't LOVE this book as much as the rest of the world.  I always find it hard to really enjoy a book with no sympathetic characters.  Everyone is guilty of something.  But I can't deny that it is an exciting read and I was constantly surprised by the turn of events.  Especially the \\"Holy Crap!\\" part half way through the novel.  I was fully engaged in the story all the way through. But I found the ending to be a little weak (especially compared the earlier parts of the book).  And weirdly, I found it to be the most psychologically disturbing part of the book.<br /><br />Fair warning, also, that there is a lot of swearing and some vulgarity.  I'm not usually that offended by that kind of stuff, but some of it is ugly enough to bother me.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app. Does everything it should, tells me how much life my phone has left, tells me how long to charge it, and it's free. Couldn't ask for more.

0307744434|4.0|The first thing you should know about The Night Circus is that the publisher description is a bit misleading. It makes it sound like Celia and Marco are dueling each other Harry Potter-style with their magic.  But that isn't really how it goes down.  Celia and Marco are entered into \\"the Competition\\" by their guardians and are taught two different schools of magic. They know they are players in this competition, but they are not given much information about the rules.  So a lot of the \\"dueling\\" part is very passive.  The circus serves as the stage for the competition. Celia and Marco create and control parts of the circus trying to outdo one another.  So really the competition is more a back and forth.  One of them creates, the other responds.  And so on and so forth for...many many years. I mention this because this passive competition could frustrate some readers who are expecting more action.<br /><br />While nothing happens quickly and events take years to unfold, the book is not boring or even slow. Morgenstern writes vividly.  The mood and atmosphere she sets is beautiful. The story has a dreamy quality, like you aren't quite sure what is real and what isn't.  I also like that she gives you just enough to believe in the magic, but stays clear from bogging it down with explanation.  The circus is the true main character and Morgenstern does an admirable job of bringing the circus to life. To paraphrase Shakespeare: All the circus is a stage, And all the men and women merely players.<br /><br />Fans of \\"The Prestige\\" and \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" will probably enjoy this book.  It truly is beautifully written and extremely enjoyable.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|words cannot describe what a page turner this book is. fast paced, finger biting, twist at every turn, unpredictable piece of art. the author writes in such a way that the reader becomes emotionally attached to even the animals in the book. best fantasy i have read in years, a MUST buy!
0142418471|4.0|I did not read the cover flap very well because when I started reading Will Grayson, Will Grayson, I had no idea what it was about.  I honestly thought it was going to have some kind of Sci-Fi alternate reality situation but that is very very far from the truth. And that is a good thing!  It is not the type of book I generally read, but I usually like them when I do.  And I generally don't get to read books where the two main characters are guys!  So yay for that!<br /><br />The story is told by alternating perspectives of each Will Grayson.  John Green and David Levithan take turns narrating for each Will Grayson.  This could have been a train wreck, but it works very well here.  Each Will ends up with a very distinctive voice and I have no problem distinguishing between the two.  Green's Will is introverted, timid and slightly nerdy.  His best friend is Tiny Cooper - a very large and gay boy with a larger than life personality.  Levithan's Will is a manic depressive goth boy who is coming to terms with being gay.  The Wills end up meeting by chance and their lives become entangled through Tiny.<br /><br />I was fully on board with this book...right up until the ending.  The book touches so many important adolescent themes - friendship, relationships, love, sexual orientation and depression.  The themes are handled with authenticity and poignancy and quite a bit of humor.  But then the ending happens with the high school musical and it is just a little too over the top for my taste.  I don't want to scare people away by saying that because the rest of the book is really good.<br /><br />I would also warn that Will Grayson, Will Grayson is not a book for everyone.  There is strong language and sexual references.  But I really enjoyed it (minus the ending).  Both Wills come a long way from the beginning of the book and there are some very sweet moments between the characters.  Just don't expect a sci-fi book - haha!
B000FC10MU|5.0|I've always liked books that have a different point of view on not just life and the world, but the imaginary world too. And this book does exactly that. It takes our view on gods of the world and religion, and it suggests something different... something plausible... It's a book that makes you think, but at the same time is just a great load of fun to read. I especially suggest it to people who have an interest in the different gods and myths of the world (Egyptian gods, Norse gods, Indian gods, etc.) and who like to examine where modern day society is going. (For instance, teens who enjoyed the Percy Jackson books as well as the Hunger Games may like this book a lot! I know I did)
B007FG9LIE|5.0|In the same tradition of a Twilight Zone meets X-Files story, secret service agent Ethan Burke goes to Wayward Pines, Idaho, his mission is to locate and recover two federal agents who went missing.<br /><br />He wakes up next to a stream, in a black suit and white shirt speckled with blood stains.  No wallet. No money.  No ID.  No keys. No phone. That's all I'll say, don't want to spoil the story.<br /><br />On every page, I kept trying to guess what would happen next, to no avail, and then the ending blew my mind!<br /><br />Blake's vivid descriptions, constant action, thrills, mystery and intrigue, reminded me of my favorite books by Stephen King and Dean Koontz.<br />Intense and gripping, Pines is a masterpiece that had me thinking about the story, long after reading the last page.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|All of the positive comments you have read about the TK41 are true.  Fenix makes excellent products and this is probably close to the current state-of-the-art in single LED flashlights.  It is well constructed, and comes in a plastic case with instructions, a lanyard, and two spare \\"O\\" rings.  Its also guaranteed for 2 years plus an additional 6 months if you register it online on the Fenix website.  The four brightness levels give you unmatched capability from a 10 lumen nightlight/tent light to 800 lumens of portable sunshine.  As a comparison, the old bulb type Maglight of just a few years back, is rated at 19 lumens.  This light is a two \\"D\\" cell size although it uses eight AA's for power.  If you are looking for a light that will fit in your pocket or purse, choose something else.  This is too big.  If you need something a little larger, and can get by the mental barrier of paying more than $100 for a flashlight, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />  * For power, I use rechargable NiMH Sanyo Eneloops.  Highly recommend you use these with a quality charger.
0547258305|5.0|Yay high fantasy!  With so much emphasis on paranormal and dystopian novels nowadays, it is refreshing to go back to swords and castles, kings and queens.  At least for me.  I grew up on that stuff.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Graceling.  I love the idea of \\"Graces\\", a sort of overly developed skill.  Katsa's Grace is to kill and she works as the King's \\"enforcer\\".  She believes herself to only be good at being a thug and not really worthy of much else.  Katsa is very much at odds with her Grace.  Until she meets Po, a prince from another kingdom.  He shows her that there is so much more to her that just being a killing machine.  And for the first time Katsa encounters someone who can match her skills.  (As a side note - I LOVE Po.  I am adding him to my list of book boyfriends - haha!).<br /><br />From there the story really takes off as Po and Katsa set off to rescue a princess in another castle. (Sorry, couldn't resist!).  The best part of the story for me is the relationship that develops between Po and Katsa.  It is sweet and sincere.  But, I should also acknowledge that Katsa's views on femininity, marriage and children might rub some readers the wrong way.  I didn't agree with her assessment, but it didn't keep me from enjoying the book.<br /><br />Cashore is a lovely writer.  I enjoyed her descriptive writing style and dry sense of humor.  There are a few times I actually laughed out loud over the characters' reactions.  My favorite by far is when Katsa is calling to Po in his mind.<br /><br />If you enjoy fantasy, then you will likely enjoy this one too! Highly recommend!
B00003CWL6|2.0|I'd heard a lot of good things about this movie, including the \\"Best Picture\\" Oscar, but I'd never seen it until recently.  Surprisingly, it was pretty disappointing because of all of the stupid little things that didn't make sense.  When I watch a movie, I am perfectly willing to buy \\"the premise,\\" and to suspend my disbelief and pretend that I'm watching some actual story, not just a bunch of actors on a set saying lines.  So, when the movie begins, I'm really willing to give it a chance until....until.....the movie gets to some point where I just say to myself \\"Yeah, right.\\"  Which means that whatever just happened has violated \\"the premise\\" of the story (probably because of the writer's laziness or poor editing), and is making the story unbelievable, unreal, contrived, and frankly, just stupid.  So that was my problem with this movie -- too much stuff in it was just plain STUPID.<br /><br />So, where to begin?<br /><br />Well, this movie takes itself so seriously that it actually comes with its own built-in hype, which TELLS you, in kind of an unofficial subtitle, to \\"look closer.\\"  Okay, fine.  So you meet the Burnham family right up front, and within seconds all three of them come off as superficial, shallow, empty, bored and boring people.  Then the movie goes on, and on, and on, and what happens?  These characters have a bunch of little episodes that reveal each of them as -- shallow, empty, and boring people.  That's the result of \\"looking closer,\\" which is not what you expect.  Because when someone says \\"look closer,\\" aren't they implying that you will see something deeper and more meaningful and more important than the appearance you see at first glance?  Sure they are.  But here, when you \\"look closer\\" at these superficial people, YOU SEE EXACTLY THE SAME THING -- SUPERFICIAL PEOPLE, EXCEPT AT A CLOSER RANGE.  So what?<br /><br />I guess to be fair you might say that Spacey's character finally shows a LITTLE depth at the very end of the movie, and apparently \\"grows up\\" a little bit when he decides not to sexually molest his daughter's friend (how NICE of him to decide not to commit statutory rape, eh?) but really, there isn't much more to it than that.<br /><br />But besides the characterization problem, there are just lots of stupid little things that are very distracting, and show a remarkable sloppiness.  Why the other reviewers chose to ignore these things is puzzling to me.<br /><br />Some examples --<br /><br />The family's house -- they live in this weird house that is like a reverse Tardis from Dr. Who.  That is, from the inside it's a rather modest two-bedroom house, but from the outside it's a rather large 4-5 bedroom house, at least double the size that the interior shots reveal.  Whaddup widdat?  Another thing about the house is that, from the outside, where it appears huge, it would seem to be way more expensive than the Burnhams could afford, especially since Spacey has some dead-end job where he works from a CUBICLE.  What does that mean?  (Come on, LOOK CLOSER.)  It means he doesn't make much money.  So how can he and his wife afford that $500K mansion?  Yet another weird thing about the house -- it has all these wide-open windows, without blinds or curtains, even in the garage, so that the neighbors can conveniently watch (and film!) things that happen in the house.  Yeah, right -- happens every day.  So, so \\"real,\\" huh?<br /><br />Spacey's sexual fixation on his daughter's friend, Angela -- I guess it doesn't bother Spacey that Angela is a minor because she projects a lot of sexuality.  Okay, fine.  But then he fantasizes about her while he's lying in bed, and what's his fantasy?  That she's lying in a bed of rose petals, with various petals strategically placed over her otherwise naked body.  Yeah, right.  As if that's the way he would be imagining her, with stupid rose petals covering her up.  Yeah right, raised to the tenth power.  No man on earth would have that fantasy.  In fact, no man sincethe beginning of the human species would have that fantasy.  Period.  But the strange thing is, that near the end of the movie, when he is finally about to have sex with her, she actually does expose her breasts, which was totally UN-necessary to the scene or the story.  Purely gratuituous nudity, and thus insulting to the viewer.  But when Angela's nudity WOULD have been perfectly appropriate, in the fantasy sequence, THEN she's covered up.  Makes no sense.<br /><br />Speaking of nudity, there is also a brief shot of Jane in a topless state, also purely gratuituous, but not only that, the shot shows how extremely well-endowed she is, and yet she is saving up her money to have breast enlargement surgery.  Huh?  After Jane's nude shot, I had to rewind to the beginning because I thought, \\"she must actually want a breast reduction, right?\\"  But no, in the beginning of the movie she is worried about being under-endowed in the breast department -- but by her nude scene, she has the over-developed body of a Vegas stripper.  Didn't anyone read both parts of the script?<br /><br />Going back to Angela for a minute, at the end of the film Spacey is apparently going to have sex with her right there IN HIS LIVING ROOM, when his daughter and her boyfriend are upstairs and when his wife can walk in at any minute -- yeah, right.  It's not stupid enough that he's going to risk going to jail for rape, we're supposed to believe that if someone walks into the room, he'll just ignore them, right?<br /><br />There are so many other stupid things like that.  The drug-dealing neighbor kid hides his pot in a drawer with a fake bottom -- as if nobody would EVER think of something so clever to hide stuff, especially his suspicious father.  But on top of this, the kid also keeps small containers of \\"clean urine\\" in the refrigerator in his room -- NOT HIDDEN AT ALL FROM HIS NOSY FATHER.  Why does he hide the pot, but not the urine?  Yeah, right.  Speaking of the father next door, apparentlyhe is a Shao Lin monk in disguise, and can therefore \\"walk through walls,\\" because at the end of the film, although he is SOAKING WET from the rain, he's able to walk right into Spacey's kitchen, come right up behind him and shoot his pistol, all with such absolute silence and stealth that Spacey doesn't know that the dripping wet father is standing there, inches behind him.  Yeah, right.<br /><br />One of my favorite stupid scenes, though, is when Bening comes home and sees Spacey's new classic muscle car, which he just bought because it's something he \\"always wanted.\\"  Then a few minutes later, he is reprimanding Bening for having bought a $4,000 silk couch, telling her that it's just \\"a thing,\\" and not important, and that his new non-material viewpoint allows him to see this profound truth, etc.  Well, what about the $25,000 that HE just spent on that \\"thing\\" in the driveway?  What's the big difference?  And then, Spacey gets a \\"fun\\" and \\"carefree\\" job at a fast food place after he quits his old job -- as if that kind minimum wage job is anything but pure drudgery and hard work, not \\"fun\\" at all.  Why isn't he shown mopping the floors and emptying the trash into the stinking dumpster out back?  That's what he'd really be doing in such a \\"fun\\" job.  And why don't they show him getting his first fast-food-job-paycheck, for less than he used to make in one day at his old job?  I guess he has no worries about his only daughter's possible college plans, eh?  No, nobody with a single teenage child worries about that.  Yeah, right.<br /><br />How so many reviewers can see this as some kind of \\"gutsy\\" or even \\"artsy\\" film is beyond me.  It had some promise, and I actually did like some of the insights that the neighbor drug-dealer kid imparted, but there are just too many \\"yeah right\\" moments otherwise, from beginning to end, to make this worthwhile.  I guess there were not that many good movies in 1999, relatively speaking, if this one got an award for being \\"the best.\\"
0345803485|3.0|After all the hoopla I wanted to know what the fuss was about. Okay, granted the book is a page turner. The author does well to give end-of-chapter cliff hangers, but nothing different than an ABC soap opera. The first book, because that is as far as I have read, is a woman who is confused, has low self-worth, low self-esteem and meets a billionaire, attractive mogul who is controlling. Who I believe borders on psychotic, as in an \\"American Psycho\\" sort of way. Its not a new story. Naive, inexperienced girl meets wealthy, attractive man, hoping for romance. But what she gets is a man w/ a freakish inclination who has more emotional on/off switches than a theatre stage lighting board. Classic story of a woman wants to change a man but ends up being sucked into his vortex. This story is mainly graphic details of arousal, sprinkled with poor character development and exhausted storylines. If you want to get butterfly feelings in your tummy, then have at it. Most people know women are intellectually stimulated, hence our trashy novels, whereas men prefer visualization aka porn. One is not any less than the other, they are the same thing just different form. Personally it angered me but maybe that is because I dont like the \\"poor me, I cant speak up for myself, I just want someone to love me and be perfect\\" female lead character.

1118156307|2.0|I was really excited about reading this book, but definitely was disappointed for two reasons: it's not clear for whom this book is written and it lacks coherent quality content.<br /><br />This book falls short as it lies in between two categories:<br />* It's too concise and fragmented to be a good introduction to people who know nothing about service design.<br />* It's too shallow for experts. The cases were lacking depth and the description of service design techniques were far too brief.<br /><br />The variety of authors reflects itself in the different quality of the chapters. Some are very good, while others contain too much shallow talk.<br /><br />This means I am still looking for a good overview book of service design, as this one isn't it.

B0069G5Z9K|1.0|The game in itself is completely awesome. However every time i log out of the game i lose all of the coins i earned. I reported the issue and went on with my day. Now i just logged in to play and had negative coins. i.e. i stopped playing with 2228 coins when i went back into the game i had negative 2228 coins. so now all coins earned go toward just paying off that balance. i have no problem using iap's but i wont as long as this is happening. reported the issue again and will rewrite review if and when issue is resolved
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is the only mahjong app I have found that actually works on my Kindle Fire so it is the best by default. Oops I forgot the 4th of July one but it is so limited with only about six games total, well it is forgetable. This pne is also limited to only 56 games then you need to buy the rest,  but at least it works!
0345803485|1.0|*Light spoilers*<br /><br />Good erotica is enjoyable to read; this book is just insipid, frankly. The writing is terrible, and I mean TERRIBLE. From the childish inner monologues to the repetitive use of phrases, to the story and plot elements, it's just terrible. You could argue that perhaps you're not looking for a literary tour de force, but it shouldn't be THIS BAD. There is other erotica out there with better written 'erotic' parts. I read the first book and part of the second and couldn't stand it any more; it's not a turn on when the heroine - who isn't likeable, believable or someone you can identify with at all - seems like she's 14 rather than 21. She's been kissed two whole times in her life, and is very ignorant about her own sexuality, (and I mean EVERYTHING about it), until somehow, miraculouly, Christian Grey comes along and she turns into a sexual dynamo, (while still retaining the adolescent mannerisms, like her petulance when it comes to eating, only now she can basically come if he pinches her. Huh?).<br /><br />Christian Gray is also not a likable character; his altruism seems forced and for effect and frankly his treatment of her is alternately heroic and abusive.<br /><br />I am sure the allure is the BDSM aspect of it, which has been to varying degrees explored in other books. This book, being popular even among celebrities, has made it okay to read about, presumably (the books also imply you're into BDSM if you had an abusive childhood). It would be one thing to read a well written, interesting book about a couple who enjoyed BDSM; it is another thing to read the 50 Shades trilogy. If you want to read it to see what the fuss is about, which was my initial draw, save the money. The one passing moment of titillation you *might* stumble across (big might), is not worth the hours you will waste slogging through fatuous, one dimensional characters, inane dialogue and boring filler. This book should serve as incentive for people to write erotic 'naughty' fiction; there's apparently a market, and it would be hard to write something worse than 50 Shades.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I was a huge fan of Lost when it aired, so when this was promoted as an \\"if you like Lost\\" show, I knew I had to watch. I also really like fantasy, and love how it's half fairy tale, half real world stories, and how everything merges together.<br /><br />The cast is great, and all the characters are interesting, though I think they may have introduced too many characters, and they could've left a few of the smaller stories out, and saved them for next season, but that's a minor complaint. I especially love Emile de Ravin, (who is a Lost alumni,) as Belle, though her part this season was small, I can't wait to see her as a regular in season two.<br /><br />I also can't wait to own this on blu-ray, and rewatch the entire season knowing what happens, since the fairy tale storylines aren't always told in order, and the real world storylines become even more interesting once you know who is really a villain or not, and who knows that they're really fairy tale characters from that start, so it's something that's definatly worth watching more then once, since you'll see things differently the second time.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Secret Daughter- I spent a summer afternoon sitting in the sun and reading this novel. It turned out to be<br />a great way to spend the afternoon. The story was thoughtful and well paced. Appreciated the telling of the<br />story from the \\"adoptive family\\" as well as the \\"biological family\\". Author included backgrounds on all characters,<br />it was a believeable and good story. Perhaps my going to India and spending time with my daughter and her new husband's<br />family really made this story seem so true. So much was familiar from family rituals to food, to family interactions.<br />I look forward to reading more from this author
B007FRHZ4A|2.0|The premise of the game is simple.  Build a castle, put pigs on it and try to knock down using the included catapult and the angry birds.  The game includes handy cards that show various configurations to build along with how many birds you have to try and knock it down.  You draw a card, one player builds the other tries to knock it down.  After the turn is over players switch roles.  Sounds like it should be hours of fun right?  Well no. The problem is that whoever designed this game did a horrible job of designing the building blocks.  The pieces are horribly balanced and trying to build anything but a simple configuration is an exercise in frustration.  The pieces are mostly slim with rectangular bases and as you build towers up, they get harder and harder to balance. Quiet often I found myself rebuilding things because the pieces kept falling down mid-build.  Since you don't get points for building the castles, and the whole point of the game is to knock them down, shouldn't they be easier to build so you can get to the fun part fast?<br /><br />Save your money and avoid yet another poorly executed cash-in on a brand name.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The author had me from the beginning.  I had no idea if I liked the main characters or hated them throughout the book.  Gillian Flynn definitely had me on the edge of my seat throughout, and cleverly through an amazing (you'll get that reference if you read it) twist right in the middle.  While most books leave the major surprise for the end, Gillian managed to throw it in the middle AMAZINGLY.  I have to say that while I was not happy and confused by the ending, I think the author did a brilliant job of keeping the reader engaged.  I definitely recommend this book.
B004VMUS9G|2.0|I have only used it a couple of times so far, but both times the sound of the alarm going off did not seem very loud even though I think I turned the volume way up. I prefer to use the alarm on my cell phone rather than this, which I was using on the kindle.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was an excellent piece of writing.  The characterization, plotting, and writing were all very well done, and I was thoroughly engrossed in the story from start to finish.  Anyone who enjoys fantasy--or anyone who enjoys a good story in general, should pick up this book.  The only glaring downside is the unfortunate abundance of spelling and grammar errors, though I suppose that comes from being independently published.  Looking forward to book two!
0062124293|3.0|I was disappointed with the content of this book.  I heard about it on the radio show \\"Fresh Air\\".  I only caught a piece of the interview, but I got the impression that the book would be more serious.  I was disappointed to find that the book is mostly personal memoir and only partially about modern feminism (the author links each memoir chapter's topic to a modern feminist \\"problem\\" and only minimally discusses the problem outside of how it relates to her experience).  As a memoir, it was fine - I could relate as I am a similar age and had some similar experiences - but I thought it was going to be more of a non-fiction piece.  As I read, I kept thinking it's style was more akin to Chelsea Handler's \\"My Horizontal Life\\" which I did not like, than to whatever it was I expected.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved Gone Girl. I thought it was well written and believable. Although I figured out \\"Who Done It\\" before it was revealed, I was still intrigued by the way it was drafted. I loved the references to contemporary media and how Flynn wove them into the plot. My only hesitation in giving it 5 stars was how it ended, although I wasn't as turned-off by the ending as a few of the reviewers. Just would have liked a little more motivation on the character's part.  Thank you Gillian Flynn.<br /><br /> J. S. Winn, author of Out of the Shadow, Amazon.com/dp/B008PYM59C

B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Jodi Picoult.... you pull my heart out and rip it to pieces... each and every single time.<br /><br />Ya I have favorite Jodi novels, and others that may not be as high on my list... But I swear, she manages EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. to make me cry... sometimes a little, sometimes a lot... but always there is a shimmer of tears in my eyeballs when I read one of her books.<br /><br />This one was no exception, though it was only a 'one runner' (a single tear down my cheek in case you are wondering).<br /><br />There was no ridiculously 'fall to my knees' devastating ending or a twist I never saw coming that leaves me gasping \\"NO WAY\\", which is what I have encountered in most of her novels that I have read. The situation is, as all of Picoult's books so far that I have read, devastating, extremely controversial and heart wrenching... and maybe incomprehensible.<br /><br />I don't know how Picoult chooses her topics. I know that they are intellectual, controversial, sensitive, difficult to digest and also quite devastating sometimes. But there is also so much hope, love, understanding, loyalty and strength as well. But it doesn't really matter what emotion or feeling comes out the strongest to me. What I love the most about her novels, and in particular with this one, is that I find myself pausing and put myself in this boy's shoes and think...<br /><br />'What if it had been me? What would I have done? Would I have done things differently? What if?'
B000I3PERS|3.0|I used to love Braveheart in high school. I thought it was a great movie. Over time, thanks to DVD's and Blu-Ray, and my expanded knowledge of history, the movie has become a joke. Scottish people won't let us hear the end of it. Wallace's success is a lot easier to understand once you understand how the battle of Stirling was really fought. Once you read about what really happened, it makes the movie a cheat. Furthermore, once you learn something about warfare, you understand that the Scottish Army depicted in the movie would have had no real chance against the English.<br /><br />Couple the historical inaccuracies with the recent revelations of Mel Gibson's psychotic behavior and penchant for Christian-oriented violence in his movies, and it's clear that he only made Braveheart for the execution scene, and nothing more. It appealed to him. After watching Passion of the Christ, it couldn't be more clear. You can't look at the movie the same way, when you realize the director didn't care about William Wallace at all.<br /><br />It would be lovely if this film was remade, properly, but that likely will not happen for many decades.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is a great. I love this game soooooo much!!!!!!!  great for adults and children.:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)
B00827OXJ2|5.0|I remember seeing this film many many years ago and I remembered some of the most unforgettable scenes.<br /><br />First off you get BOTH the 'R' rated theatrical version and the 'Unrated' version which is quite a bit more intense and sexual.<br /><br />I'm not going to get into the story because there is enough info out there about this film.  So I'd rather share my experiences with the quality of the transfer.<br /><br />I watched this blu-ray on an 80\\" LED LCD screen and the quality of the transfer is superb.  It has definitely been cleaned up prior to the transfer.  The images throughout are crystal clear sharp, the colors vibrant (but not overblown) and the blacks deep and rich.  The audio is Dolby Digital Stereo (if I can remember correctly) but it also is crystal clear and you can hear every word whether spoken very softly or loudly.<br /><br />There are NO supplements, not even a trailer.  When you put the disc inside your player it goes right to the movie immediately after the Olive Films and Paramount Pictures logos.<br /><br />The only nitpick I have is the slipcover.  Whether done on purpose or not, it looks like it was printed years ago as it appears slightly faded and a bit rough in texture.  But hey, maybe that is how it was intended to look and feel.<br /><br />All in all, I rate this blu-ray 5 stars for both the transfer and the movie itself.  If you like intense thrillers with a sexual edge then this is a great example of very well-done film with absolutely brilliant performances by the entire cast especially the two leading ladies.  They truly make this film so believable and provide the sizzling sexuality that lies at the very core of the film.<br /><br />A MUST HAVE ... BUY IT !

B005LAIHSQ|2.0|This movie could of been great. However all the times you saw the evil queen in the movie were what you already saw in previews. Also Kristen Stewart sucked as usual. I never liked her ever as an actress. The only role I kind of like her in is twilight but still she is just so annoying. In my eyes she will always be a horrible actress. Story line could of been a lot better. Previews make it look like you are going to see a different type of movie then what it really is.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to admit I purchased this book because everyone in my office was reading it and said it was a must read. Well I took out my trusty Kindle and in about 1 minute I was reading. I would have to say that this book is very addictive and will no doubt intice you to continue on with the series. Answers to your questions do come and it is worth the read. The writer deffinately has a way of keeping you turning the pages and losing sleep. I finished the whole series in just over a week, excited to get answers but bummed the story was over. The ending is predictable but what a journey.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|There was not a slow or flawed moment in this book. A work of art. From the first sentence to the last, I was so caught up in the plot twists and the character details that I couldn't stop reading. There's not too much of the story that I'd even consider talking about here because I wouldn't want to give away anything that will detract from the sheer enjoyment you will get when you read this book. Blake has always put out some good stuff, but this takes his name in the world of of fiction to another level entirely. A book I could, and will, read more than once.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this bag bundled with a Canon t3i DSLR just under a year ago. At the time I purchased the bundle I figured it was no real loss if I didn't like the bag and I could just get a new one later. I am quite pleased to say that I have not needed to. I have been impressed by this bag's sturdy construction and ample space.<br /><br />Currently I carry the following items in my bag:<br />Canon t3i body with 18-55mm lens attached<br />Canon 75-300mm lens<br />Canon 50mm lens<br />Macro extension tube kit<br />Canon 430EX II Speedlite<br />Battery charger for t3i<br />Battery charger for 4 Eneloop batteries<br /><br />I still have barely put anything in the interior zip compartments and I have 3 main padded compartments empty. I like how the interior zipped compartments on the lid are clear so you can see what is in each compartment at a glance. I have worn this bag through the San Antonio Zoo and over a few hiking trails and once I got the straps adjusted properly it has been entirely comfortable. The straps and back of the backpack have a reasonable amount of padding which serves its purpose well. After nearly a year I cannot see any damages to the seams and none of the stitching seems to be coming apart.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this bag.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It has a sound that's smooth and doesn't repeat every 30 seconds. Works great with or without earbuds. Can have several sounds combined each at it's own volume. I have the free version.
0345803493|3.0|This book continues with repetition. It is becoming very monotonous.  Boring.  I keep waiting for something to happen.  The same description of \\"getting it on\\" are also tedious.  The only good thing going for it, Ana and Christian practise 'safe sex'.  On ya!

B005EM8O8O|2.0|After hearing an interview with the author on the radio several months ago, I had high hopes for this book. I've read and really enjoyed Fatherland, so I knew I was in for a good read. Meh, not so much. As other reviewers have noted, too much times is spent on Alex's wealth and the characters all seem to be pretty flat. Throughout the story, I was anticipating VIXAL to become like HAL or the house in Amityville and do what was necessary to ensure its own survival, but that certainly wasn't the case. I suppose it just permeated into the ether to perpetually build wealth for HIT? The ending left me confused. Well, at least I learned a little about hedge funds.
B0086700CM|5.0|all of you people that are saying this is a horrabel game well your stupid idiots who don't deserve what ever you guys are on
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|Game starts way too fast to enjoy, Barry drops down like a brick. The game slows down when there is differential scrolling, then picks up again and goes faster after every 500m.<br />As a result, I cannot get past 2000m, when I got easily over 5000m on ipod. I know not great, but way more playable on ipod.<br />In this port there is little to no time to react after passing 1000m, an example is with the missiles, they lock on superfast .. you had more time on ipod.<br />Disappointing.
B002GOAH1A|4.0|i've had considerable fun here, expressing my inner Leonard Maltin, but i have no delusions about my ability to make it as a professional critic. try as they might, the Powers That Be would never be able to convert me to what is clearly the profession's most sacrosanct dictum, namely...<br />&#34;comedies or fantasy adventures, technically known as &#34;fun&#34; or &#34;necessary&#34; movies, are utterly beneath contempt. every blue moon or so, one such title will be drawn from a hat, and that one you may recommend if so moved. all others, even if you enjoy them, are to be regarded and treated as deliberately malicious assaults against you personally.<br />&#34;conversely, dramas about day-to-day life in The Real World, technically known as &#34;boring&#34; or &#34;pointless&#34; movies, are the very sacredest of sacred cows. if you don't feel moved to recommend one such film, it is to receive only the most businesslike slap on the wrist, as if it had simply forgotten to deliver an important memo or something.&#34;<br />this irrational and illogical prejudice against the very concept of escapism has frustrated me many a time, but never quite so profoundly as in this case. of all the films i've loved only to see slandered by the critics - Ghostbusters II, The Shadow, The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle - this is easily the one that got the rawest deal. let me put it this way: Wild Wild West is hands-down the greatest film ever to &#34;win&#34; a Razzie.<br />of course it was always destined to be the sort of film said snobs would sneer at, but how did the ill-will get so far? how did it reach the point where Will Smith was actually browbeaten into apologizing to original star Robert Conrad for &#34;desecrating&#34; his signature character? and don't even get me started on those killjoys who to this day refuse to let Smith (or anyone else, for that matter) ever forget that he turned down The Matrix to make this film. apparently it's a moot point that The Matrix is a wad of convoluted metaphysical gibberish, whereas whatever else you wanna say about WWW, at least it makes sense.<br />what it reflects is one of the sadder realities of movies, indeed of life itself: once a juggernaut builds up momentum, about all you can do is get the hell out of the way.<br />this was Will Smith's, as well as director Barry Sonnenfeld's, immediate follow-up to their triumphant collaboration Men In Black, and contrary to gossip, lightning DID strike twice. i can understand, in theory at least, the thinking behind the common criticism that turning Jim West from white to black resulting in little more than a gimmick, since Smith basically recycles his MiB characterization. well, it's a gimmick that works if you let it. it results in an essence of Blazing Saddles that i've always found quite piquant. and the property can get away with that, since it already had one foot in the fanciful. in whatever form WWW is the quintessential &#34;steampunk&#34; premise. (i know, the term generally refers to science-fiction in a Victorian setting, but any segment of the past will do.) it's the adventures of spies in the Old West for cryin' out loud, not Masterpiece Theater.<br />it must've had some promise to get Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh on board. Kline, as inventor/master of disguise Artemus Gordon, manages to develop as potent a chemistry with Smith and Tommy Lee Jones had done a film earlier. it's not quite the same flavor, but then Kline isn't the same sort of actor. they're as much fun together as Smith and Jones had been, so who cares if it took a slightly different route?<br />Branagh, meanwhile, plays a surreal but somehow viable cyborg variation on West's tv arch-nemesis, Dr. Loveless. yes, i do find it a little odd that they chose to cripple the nearly 6-foot Branagh rather than simply cast another midget. your guess is as good as mine just what behind-the-scenes circumstances bought this situation about, but they managed to work around it. moviemaking is often a matter of making something out of what you have to work with, after all. in any case, of the film's foremost strengths is that it so experiments with the premise. if it had simply cloned the series, what would even be the point?<br />(although i can easily explain the change of first name, in this case to Arliss. in the 60s, Loveless had been played by one Michael Dunn, and was called Miguelito (&#34;Little Michael&#34; in Spanish) on that basis. obviously the pun became moot with Branagh's arrival.)<br />be any of that as it may, the choice pays off. it's often said that a given hero and/or story is only as good as his/it's villain, and Branagh delivers in spades. he plays an old school Southern &#34;gentleman&#34; who wants to secede because the slaves have been freed, and Branagh exudes the very venomous charisma such a character requires with seemingly no effort whatsoever. playing his famous Shakespearean training for all it's worth, he manages to be a force of nature without chewing a stitch of scenery. like every worthy villain he steals all of his scenes, at least until his ultimate comeuppance.<br />neither Kline nor Branagh does this sort of thing often, and both clearly had a blast with the change of pace. because whatever WWW might lack or fail to offer, it does bristle with the brand of exhilaration which some would say was everything in such a &#34;popcorn&#34; movie.<br />of course this a fairly late date to say so. that juggernaut has had more than 15 years to wreak it's havoc. it's sobering but not surprising that people can be so easily swayed from the &#34;work&#34; of evaluating something for themselves. this wonderful movie got a wholly undeserved stigma through the very phenomenon that gets lackluster or corrupt politicians in office.<br />besides, if we're completely honest, the root of the problem here goes even deeper than that. when all is said and done, good or bad, wonderful or horrible, it's only a movie for crimony sakes! it's one thing not to care for it, but failing to entertain you is hardly the same as, say, mugging or raping you.<br />how did things get to this point? seriously, if someone these days fails to &#34;click&#34; with a given movie or song or tv series or whatever, they often seem to feel a more seething, more passionate hostility against it than they could ever feel toward, say, Hitler. how did this piece of zeitgeist ever come to pass?<br />i guess part of it could be the question of first-hand experience. those outraged by, for instance, Gigli or Last Action Hero tend to be people who were born after Hitler had come and gone. in other words, they can understand intellectually that Hitler did far more egregious damage than Gigli ever could, but they've only heard about Hitler, whereas they were here to personally see Gigli wreak it's own havoc.<br />but even so, people should be smart enough to recognize that (a) the emotional factor is misleading us here, and (b) rumor has a tendency to get out of hand. there's something truly depressing about a situation where a spirited, good-natured romp like Wild Wild West could find itself on the same level of esteem as Hitler. it may not be as tragic as if, say, Jesus Christ were to be so reduced to Hitler's level, but it's still a bummer.aking is often a matter of making something out of what you have to work with, after all. in any case, of the film's foremost strengths is that it so experiments with the premise. if it had simply cloned the series, what would even be the point?<br />(although i can easily explain the change of first name, in this case to Arliss. in the 60s, Loveless had been played by one Michael Dunn, and was called Miguelito (&#34;Little Michael&#34; in Spanish) on that basis. obviously the pun became moot with Branagh's arrival.)<br />be any of that as it may, the choice pays off. it's often said that a given hero and/or story is only as good as his/it's villain, and Branagh delivers in spades. he plays an old school Southern &#34;gentleman&#34; who wants to secede because the slaves have been freed, and Branagh exudes the very venomous charisma such a character requires with seemingly no effort whatsoever. playing his famous Shakespearean training for all it's worth, he manages to be a force of nature without chewing a stitch of scenery. like every worthy villain he steals all of his scenes, at least until his ultimate comeuppance.<br />neither Kline nor Branagh does this sort of thing often, and both clearly had a blast with the change of pace. because whatever WWW might lack or fail to offer, it does bristle with the brand of exhilaration which some would say was everything in such a &#34;popcorn&#34; movie.<br />of course this a fairly late date to say so. that juggernaut has had more than 15 years to wreak it's havoc. it's sobering but not surprising that people can be so easily swayed from the &#34;work&#34; of evaluating something for themselves. this wonderful movie got a wholly undeserved stigma through the very phenomenon that gets lackluster or corrupt politicians in office.<br />besides, if we're completely honest, the root of the problem here goes even deeper than that. when all is said and done, good or bad, wonderful or horrible, it's only a movie for crimony sakes! it's one thing not to care for it, but failing to entertain you is hardly the same as, say, mugging or raping you.<br />how did things get to this point?

0345803493|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a poorly written, teenage level romance with some XXX rated sex that borders on uncomfortable given the introduction of the DOM/SUB lifestyle and a torture chamber aka \\"playroom\\" or \\"Red Room of Pain\\". Having said that, like Twilight (which I am also embarrassed to say I read), you get sucked in and cant put it down. You can enjoy it for what it is but dont take it seriously as a piece of literature.<br /><br />This book, however, is by the far the worst book I have ever read.  It is utterly pathetic in plot, character development, editing (I agree with the other review - WHERE WAS THE EDITOR??) it is embarrassing to say I read it. I was in agony finishing this book having wasted any time on it, even the sex scenes I had to glaze over as I found them to be so over the top to the point of being uninteresting.  It's unbelieveable in how the characters could go from just meeting to mind boggling, simultaneous orgasmic sex (with a virgin no less), to Christian Grey's seriously f-ed up issues being resolved, and then engaged in a matter of a few weeks.  It reads like a horrible teenage romance novel with repetitive teenage eye rolling, smirks, temper tantrums, it's just awful.  On a side note, I found it odd that two erotica novels did not use any erotic words for the male and female genitalia.  As in, \\"suck my ----\\", \\"lick my -----\\". Just weird and lacking IMHO.
B00846REIS|5.0|Couldn't put this book down! While there were similarities between this book and 50 Shades of Grey that is just what they were... similarities. The characters and the plot were unique in their own way. The sex scenes were fantastic!! Can't wait for Reflected in You!!!
B004FEJ3VY|4.0|Overall it is nice and detail for this price. However, the small pieces (not the guns/gas tanks) keeps falling off. He loves 2 keep OptimusPrime around for almost a whole week whenever he goes to sleep or goes out. He likes to fight the bad guys so he hits the other subjects around and the small pieces fall off upon impact. I don't think this toy would last with kids. He even pull out the arm when he tried to attach the gun. The toy is good to display more than to play with. Its impossible to transform into the truck and vice versa unless you're an adult. But, I'm pleased that he likes and plays with it for a while\^^/

So many wonderful insights that have the possibility to make such a positive change in American parenting. I am so glad that it has come out while I still have young children. I feel like it really re-inforces common sense. Why should I feel like a lazy parent if I don't try and force my 18 month old to read? I have so enjoyed this perspective of how we need more \\"cadre\\". Love, love, love it. I have had so many friends ask to borrow it, but this is one book that I want to keep. I will not part with my copy :).
B001BFFTO0|5.0|I bought the dark brown ones a few months ago - I love wearing them.<br /><br />I haven't found nice boots that look like this in black, so I bought black ones a day ago, here on Amazon.<br /><br />A few people are saying that the sizing is off - its true - so, to help future buyers i'd like to just compare my first pair, which are a size 7.5M.<br /><br />I don't have a ruler, but i do have an envelope. Everybody gets mail, so you can try this with any of your own shoes to measure the difference.<br /><br />First, Get a regular white envelope, fold it in half (longwise), and fold it again (the same way).<br /><br />I placed one side against the edge of the heel. The length of my Timberlands (7.5M) were about 5 folds long of the white envelope, with just a regular pencils width to spare.<br /><br />When i do the envelope test on my other shoes (sneakers, skate shoes, boat shoes, dress shoes) they are all approximately 5 folds of the white envelope in lenght.<br /><br />These boots are thinner then skate and sports shoes, so the fit is like dress shoes, there's no stuffin on the inside.<br /><br />If they fit a bit big, go out and buy some thick socks. Maybe you will have to wear two pairs of socks to really get that sneakers snug fit. But at least you will have the length of boot as your shoes so that you dont look like you have small feet when you wear them.<br /><br />One more thing, if you notice the pics of these boots, there's a lift on the toe, ...FYI, its not the pic. These boots by design have that lift. (i really hate it) but it sorta decreases after wear.

B008602KQI|2.0|First off I was waiting till midnight to see the release of Hunger Games. I have not read the books, by choice because all great \\"fanatatic\\" books have been made into movies. Instead of being disapointed, I will wait to read the books.<br /><br />This said, Hunger Games the movie lacks emotion, story line and character build-up. It litterally felt like I was tossed into a movie I should already understand(I don't because I did not read the books) and feel motivated or inspired to care for others. First off the romance was off putting and had no depth. The fighting scenes, did not feel real or look like this was the only way they will win. The premise I guess I understand, but to compare it to other movies with the same like theme, \\"society run by top dogs\\" pushing the poor into fighting to create fear so they won't rise up. Anyone scene Equilibrium? Just one movie I can compare the concept.<br /><br />When will directors and art directors start putting creativity into films. We live in a different time, we should be impressed with the creation of film. Not the fact everyone who saw the movie and liked it; read the book. Which I believe is a cheap way to make money off films, you go into the movie-goers psyche and remind them what they read, by putting visual effects to re-kindle the story. Even though it was a royal bore to watch.<br /><br />Like many I was hoping to watch something motivating me to do better, to feel like the world is understandable. All I saw was ego, ego, ego.... need more ego, less ego and oh fight. Thanks for the mis-lead everyone. I wasted my time and money on a horrible movie, I hope the next one learns from mistakes and takes the film to the next level. They obviously have a book to work off of that sells, make the movies simillar.

B007CIQ4B2|5.0|I saw Ben Howard on Letterman and immediately had to get this album.  He may be the next Paul Simon with a hint of Sting in the lyric writing.<br />To say his style is \\"folk\\" is somewhat of a misnomer, again it's more Simon & Garfunkel.  His back up band is a fine bunch of musicians and singers<br />with great harmonics.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This best-seller grips you right from the start and keeps you in its grips right until the end. A young couple meets, falls in love, marries, starts a life in The City, and then changes everything when they lose their jobs and move to a rural town to care for his ailing mother.<br />The story is told in alternating 'diary' entries from each of them and it does not take too long for the reader to intuit that something is deeply wrong. However, it seems to be going along a straight path with a pretty good plot until there is a whiplash of a plot twist, then another, and another.<br />The writing is good and character development is great and, had you asked me how I liked the book just before I read the last chapter, I would have given it ten stars. Unfortunately - and this is just me - I was deeply unhappy with the last twist and the loose ends because at this stage of my life I am all for neat and tidy endings.<br />Worth a read, but I would not put it on my list of \\"gotta keep this one because I want to read it again\\" books.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I'm betting Blake Crouch paid close enough attention to David Lynch's iconic series that he knew Laura's killer before anybody else.<br /><br />Equal parts McCarthy-inspired prose and elements of Twin Peaks with a double shot of Twilight Zone poured over the last act. Aside from the style and penchant for brutality, there's little in common with the JA Konrath collaborations Crouch is best known for, but variety is definitely a good thing in this case.Blake Crouch is my favorite modern writer, and PINES is yet another reason on the long list why.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|Just when you think you've got a handle on the frustrating and bizarre world of Wayward Pines, Blake Crouch throws you for a loop (literally, on occasion). It's only natural for readers to try to figure out the why and how of a mystery/thriller, but Crouch tosses in a grenade of sci-fi that will blow your mind, so don't even waste your brain power trying to deduce the undeducable. Just go along for the ride.<br /><br />The ending is vaguely reminiscent (and not in the way you might assume) of the end of Stephen King's 'The Dome', which I personally didn't love, so I can't say it was my favorite ending of all time. BUT...it was completely unexpected and creative, which makes up for any \\"Oh, come on\\" feelings I may have had.<br /><br />Crouch is a solid writer with weird ideas -- always a winning combination!<br /><br />A note on Kindle formatting: This Kindle edition was clearly well-proofed as there were very few formatting issues.<br /><br />If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!
1451627297|5.0|This one is a keeper.  You can read all the other reviews if you want to know the details of the plot.  King is popular because he captures the humanity in his characters.  If you grew up during this period, it was very well researched and your in for a treat.  The story was one of the most touching I've ever read. This has got to be filmed into a movie!  It's a story too good to confined to the medium of books.  I can see this one being directed by Ron Howard or Rob Reiner.  I can see the day when Stephen King's novels will be required reading in colleges.  This book is the reason why he's a best selling author around the world.
B008UUPOVM|4.0|Owl City's Adam Young already struck gold a few years ago with his single \\"Fireflies.\\"  It would be hard to predict if his 4th full-length album, THE MIDSUMMER STATION, would be as successful, but if the early success of hit single \\"Good Time,\\" is any indication, it may be bigger than his breakthrough record.<br /><br />THE MIDSUMMER STATION is checkered with collaborations and guest-appearances, so it feels a bit more varied than Owl City's OCEAN EYES.  The album begins with one of its hardest hitters: \\"Dreams and Disasters.\\"  It's a song that's fully of energy, and it's given a thick layer of electronic production.  The song is followed with the fantastic \\"Shooting Star,\\" a pop song with a hook so catchy, you'll want to throw it on repeat.  If you happen to make it to the third track, \\"Gold,\\" the song is pretty standard by Owl City's standards.  Marked by soft electronic music, light synthesizers, produced vocals, and happy lyrics, it's a good representation of the album as a whole.  THE MIDSUMMER STATION is an album in search of a good time, and Adam Young brings it with his innocent brand of fun.  The Mark Hoppus (from Blink 182) collaboration \\"Dementia\\" feels like a late-era Blink 182 song, with all of its punk-rock and poppy chorus.  The other notable collaboration, \\"Good Time\\" features Carly Rae Jepsen (of \\"Call Me Maybe\\" fame), is already receiving heavy rotation on the radio for its catchy, summer-ready melody.  The slower tracks on the album also work exceptionally well.  Owl City strips away all of the production for the bare piano-ballad \\"Silhouette.\\"  Closing track \\"Take it all Away\\" is a ballad that recounts a heartbreak in pretty painstaking detail.<br /><br />I would recommend THE MIDSUMMER STATION to listeners who are looking for a light, breezy pop record.  Fans of the Postal Service's more poppy side will likely find some tunes here to love.  It has its highs and lows -- it's not a perfect album -- but it is sure to entertain most of the runtime.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"Shooting Star,\\" \\"Good Time,\\" and \\"Metropolis.\\"Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"Shooting Star,\\" \\"Good Time,\\" and \\"Metropolis.\\"

B008GFI4KY|3.0|This album is more songs by the Darkness.  That's honestly the best way to describe it.  Almost nothing about their sound has changed, and if you've heard a handful of their songs, you'll know what to expect.  And while I certainly wouldn't penalize them for sounding just like themselves, their third album (and essentially a \\"reunion\\" album) never nears the heights from their debut PERMISSION TO LAND.  Let me make this clear: I'm as glad as anyone that the band gives listeners what we want: outrageous vocals, crunchy guitar riffs, etc... but these songs never quite live up to the band's past work.  All the elements are there, but they never quite come together in a way that's exciting; probably not that surprising given that the band openly acknowledges that their reunion was more for money than any other reason.<br /><br />The Darkness don't pretend that you are listening to their album for any other reason but the 70's rock-guitar riffs, Hawkins' screaming falsetto, and his vulgar lyrics laced with double-entendres.  The album begins with \\"Every Inch of You,\\" a song whose first stanza is a self-aware musing about the band's hiatus.  \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us\\" feels like a Queen B-Side with its harmonic and theatrical chorus.  HOT CAKES' lead single, \\"Everybody Have a Good Time,\\" is one of the Darkness's more modest songs, and you can probably guess what the song is about based on its title.  Of particular interest is the cover of Radiohead's \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out).\\"  As a Radiohead fan, I was expecting the worst, but the Darkness give it their own spin, and it injects new life into the song.  With \\"Forbidden Love,\\" the band veers into more serious territory with middling results.  Similarly, the album's final song, \\"Love is Not the Answer,\\" attempts to be more mature, and while the music is pretty good, the melody never quite grips the listener.  It's a decent enough song but pretty generic by the band's usually outrageous standard.<br /><br />HOT CAKES comes with a few extra tracks -- four of them to be exact.  They are all demo-recordings: \\"I Can't Believe It's Not Love (Acoustic Demo),\\" \\"Love is Not the Answer (Acoustic Demo),\\" \\"Pat Pong Ladies (Demo),\\" and the long version of \\"Cannonball.\\"  These extra songs really aren't that great -- the acoustic demos really take the magic out of the Darkness's formula.<br /><br />For fans looking for more music of The Darkness, HOT CAKES certainly provides it as long as listeners aren't expecting another PERMISSION TO LAND.  I'd say that it's a little better than their second album, ONE WAY TICKET TO HELL AND BACK.  Listeners who were never enthralled by the band's swagger won't be taken with this album.

B005LAIHPE|3.0|Based loosely on the Hasbro game and concept, this movie takes a little while to get going, but once it does, it's a pretty exciting ride.<br /><br />The movie starts with scientists attempting to send out a deep space signal to another nearby star system to try to communicate. Unfortunately, the aliens turn out to be hostile and decide to home in on earth and conquer it since our two planets are similar and can support the same type of life, perhaps because their planet is dying and they need to find a new home.<br /><br />Most of the psychological tension in the movie is about the relationship between between Liam Neeson, the admiral, and Alex Skarsgard, a bright but ne'er-do-well young officer who wants to marry the admiral's daughter, but the admiral is singularly unimpressed with Skarsgard as a new graduate officer assigned to his battle group. Of course, he saves the day, redeeming himself in the admiral's eyes and gets the hand of the admiral's daughter in marriage after all.<br /><br />That's just the romantic backdrop to the movie, and the rest of the story line in some ways doesn't make much sense, but the action and special effects are what it's all about. For example, the aliens, for all their more advanced technology, are slow to capitalize on their opportunities and often just seem to waste time doing nothing much of the time. Of course, this just gives the humans the needed time to regroup and figure out how to defeat them. They also have the ability to create a large enough force field to cover a considerable area of the ocean, trapping some of the human ships and excluding others, but they don't seem to have the ability to generate a forcefield to protect their individual ships as they are still vulnerable to the humans' guns and missiles. Why the aliens can create such a large force field and not be able to create smaller ones to protect individual ships doesn't make much sense and isn't explained in the movie. But then if that were true the humans wouldn't have had much of a chance at all.<br /><br />The special effects are cool though and the alien technology is superior to ours in many ways, and also different. As one reviewer here mentioned perceptively, they don't seem to understand the concept of a guided missile. Instead, their ships shoot out these giant buzz saw weapons the size of small cars, and only two or three of these can shred a whole ship in a matter of minutes. Military history buffs may remember the British developed something similar during WWII which had a funny name, the Jabberwocky or Hurdy-Gurdy, I don't exactly remember.  But it was a giant rocket propelled wheel designed for use on a beachhead and this was reminiscent of that. The other main weapon the aliens have resembles a ship-to-ship mine which is fired from a launcher and embeds itself in the side of a ship and then explodes. The alien troops also have powered armor--the sort that the mobile infantry should have had in the Starship Troopers movie of some years back (and which was present in the Robert Heinlein novel that the movie was based on).<br /><br />The movie pays homage to the old Missouri battleship which saves the day at the very end of the movie, and is being manned by elderly members of her crew who were there to give the tours and answer questions for the public, a very cool idea. Overall, a fun movie with spectacular CGI special effects and with enough action to be worth your time on a lazy weekend evening.wouldn't have had much of a chance at all.<br /><br />The special effects are cool though and the alien technology is superior to ours in many ways, and also different.

Wentworth Miller had an interesting role, I guess it will be fully developed in Resident Evil 5. Not enough Boris kudjoe, he had a great presence. Where is this film or series of films leading to? Very confusing at times
0596522347|4.0|This book dates back to 2008 but is unsurprizingly still selling well. What is unusual is that it is only available as a pdf from O'Reilly and in Kindle format at Amazon. There are no epub or daisy formats available as far as I can see. If you need to get up to speed with presentations this is a great book. It has a lot of content so it won't enable you to create magic within 5 minutes. It will give you great insights.<br /><br />It starts really with an attitude intro including some great facts... you'll need 36-90 hours to create a great presentations. Pointers (research, audience, ideas, organize, critique, story board, 20-60 hours building the slides, rehearse,). Later it goes into incredible detail about graphics, illustrations, data, design aspects, animation, being the boss on templates... read it, take it on board. Nancy Duarte was behind probably the best presentation of all time \\"Al Gores - Inconvenient truth\\".<br /><br />Good book and I recommend it. But also take a look at Guy Kawasaki. He has some very good guidelines, the 10-20-30 rule being the real winner. Check it out. An interesting counter trend though is Jeff Bezos who has banned powerpoints, it's all whiteboard at Amazon. Cool, the planning, analysis and presentation tips from this book would help anyway. Put away the fear, grab some zen and start on your path to being a presentation ninja.

B007XNAOS0|5.0|Baroness<br />Yellow & Green<br />Relapse<br />☆☆☆ 1/2<br />  Not many hard rock bands-or bands in general- are releasing double albums these days. Well, with a solid set-list for two records, Baroness does just that on their third and fourth full-length releases. The first disc titled Yellow, is pure re-affirmation that Baroness pain-stakedly bleeds out every bit of their creative beings during the recording process. The disc's intro, \\"Yellow Theme\\" is the perfect segue into the second cut,\\"Take My Bones Away.\\" This is also the first video from the double record (which is priced as a single record), and, as far as a single, no radio station will have the balls to pick it up. The track is certainly solid enough for rotation at new rock radio. What makes this track so unique are the drenching lead work all through the song by guitarist Pete Adams. He matches vocalist/guitarists John Dyer Baizley's rhythm tracks with mono-syllabic-like attack. The song is evenly matched on guitar thrills, which sounds really nice in the mix.<br />\\"March To The Sea\\" begins with a nice cascading guitar ascension and jumps into a staccato-like ride. Baizley's vocals almost seem to be so surreal and pushing the Baroness envelope to a new level of contention. There seems to be a pattern with the working riffs on Yellow, a very hypnotic and enchanting regale that really moves the music as a perfect soundtrack for the summertime. The acoustic ditty \\"Twinkler\\" is further affirmation of the previously mentioned. The sounds are sub-sonic and hypnotizing all at the same time. Which, at the end crosses over nicely into \\"Cocanium.\\" Picking up with a hard bass beat that turns a bit funky for the intro and verses. There's a lot of droning type sounds in between the tracks and intro's, and \\"Back Where I Belong\\" is an excellent example of this almost seemingly experimental technique. \\"Sea Lungs\\" get's things churning again and is reminiscent of violent sea waters that rage during a violent storm. This album ends on \\"Eula\\" another drifty-type piece that turns really psychedelic in nature and could also beam on a sunny day in the park or beach with a good buzz on.<br />  As for the Green Album, Baroness really expands on the whole experimental notion of the creative side of their innards. Everything is so methodically layered and rich in sound. Like the first album's format \\"Green Theme\\" floats into the second track \\"Board Up The House.\\" Baizley almost seemingly changes his voicing with his dynamic vocals, almost sounding like and entirely different singer in the band. The Green Record continues on with that very avant-garde sound procurement on \\"Mtns. (The Crown & Anchor).\\" Which, is a little slower of a piece than most prior Baroness tracks. Proving to continue on \\"Foolsong,\\" which is heavy laden with harmonies. The band really satellites around the mellow with \\"Collapse\\" and \\"Psalms Alive\\" while shape-shifting textures between the two cuts. \\"Stretchmarker\\" is a beautiful acoustic piece mixed with some spacey and soupy overdubs. This is probably one of my favorite tracks on the double album. \\"The Line Between\\" has got some big notes in it opening stanza, but takes off like a rocket when the first verse is laid down, and has a taste of silver, and a taste of gold. To re-iterate this and insightful release and won't hold water in the land of pop, but stands like a mountain in brave and daring. This is also reportedly the last color-themed albums from the band that hails from Savannah, Georgia.<br />Gigz Giger
B0084IG7KC|2.0|I felt very let down by the movie, was a huge fan of the books. I expected the movie not to fall in line with the book as they normally don't, but it gave no time to build up compassion or interest in any of the characters. I felt it left out anything of worth about the actual story.
B008FDOS66|3.0|It's either bad Skynyrd or a really good Montgomery Gentry or Toby Keith album. I can't decide.But either way most of the songs have really good hooks but lack some searing guitar leads like Skynyrd of old. A little better than GOD & Guns but not by a wide margin so if you enjoyed that one you should this one as well.And make sure you get the deluxe edition because the bonus tracks are just as good if not better than those on the standard edition.
B005LAIH54|3.0|Good action and good cast, enjoyed it, but not as good as the clash of the titans, as liked the storyline better in the 1st

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This is without a doubt the best show on AMC or on n e network as far as im concerned the only bad thing about this 1st season is the length the 6 episodes will hook u from the very first frame and u will never want the the story 2 end it's really that good the characters are interesting the zoombies look extremely realistic the acting is stellar what more could u ask 4 i hope this show gets the recogniton it deserves if not all u lames out there will miss out on this amazing show!

B005LAJ23A|5.0|B4 i actually talk about this Epic series i would like 2 address all u hatin naysayers out there 1st off no 1 is holding a gun 2 ur head and forcing u 2 watch the show so its really simple 2 just turn the channel if u don't like what ur seeing idiots smart people like myself do not watch shows if i can't stand them secondly there r alot of great series on tv right now but it bothers me when i see people saying nothing but good things about shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones don't get me wrong im a fan of those 2 but most people aren't as critical 2wards those shows they way the are 2wards The Walking Dead no show is perfect but i can honestly say TWD gets as close as possible this is truly Excellent TV and all u haters need 2 chill out. Also 4 all the people claiming the second season started off 2 slow u obviously don't understand there is a diffrence between doing 6 ep and 13 ep so of course there is more room for story and if it wasn't 4 the great character development and drama the show wouldn't be as special it would just be another addition 2 the already flooded market of mindless action of people blowing off zoombie heads every 2 sec and we all know how long that stays fun 4 and then u would be complaing about that and lastly this is the 1st zoombie platform worthy of high praise and awards due 2 the acting<br /><br />Once again i need 2 stress that this is the best show on tv right now and that original series this captivating are extremely rare. This is the best post apocalyptic story i have ever witnessed the writers and the actors make u really care about these characters and u really want them 2 survive while watching u really feel like ur part of the group and when some1 falls victim 2 the zoombies u really feel a sense of losing a dear friend. sometimes the show drags out some plots but when they finally reveal a certain mystery it is always something surprising that u won't see coming and it will be well worth the wait i really wish this showcan last at least 10 seasons if not more cause i can't get enough!

030758836X|5.0|*written by the husband*<br /><br />Think about this scenario: I read this book during my lunch hours at work.  Well, today, my lunch hour was about up.  I have 15 pages left.  I don't want to put it down, because I still have no idea how it is going to end, and even though I have to get back to work,  I REALLY, REALLY want to know how it ends.<br /><br />Anyway, I go back to work, and I finished reading it.  Still mesmerized and creeped out.<br /><br />That's the kind of book I want to stand out in my head, the one where I must read it from start to finish, and even toward the end, I haven't been able to come close to predicting what's going on.  This will definitely stay with me for a while.<br /><br />I'll admit it was slow to build on part one.  I didn't really need to know about the Blue Book Boys, and that definitely was too much of a red herring that the author threw out.  It was extremely forgiveable though, once part two of this three-part book kicked off, and I don't count that as any sort of penalty.<br /><br />What works so well is its character development.  The characters ended up being so evil, and yet ironically they were evil in the most likeable ways.  The development of both Nick and Amy are complete, and I felt very much a part of each of their lives as I visit each of their twisted, sick minds.<br /><br />I have already taken a look at Flynn's other works, and I am definitely going to put them on my wish list.  In the meantime, if you like being in suspense, and being creeped out, definitely get this book.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love the movie - thank God for the free digital copy that comes on Amazon Instant Video, otherwise I still wouldn't have been able to see it because my actual DVD has yet to be shipped.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Ive been a fan for awhile. This movie is about as close to the book as you can get without making it 4 or 5 hours long. They put in just about every major piece from the book and did a decent job in casting. Gale and Katniss are a little too well fed for district 12. Gale is freaking buff and these people are suppose to be starving. Katniss is described in the book to be scrawny and boney like a runway model figure - Jennifer Lawrence is not. Cato need to be more psychotic. He trained his entire life to kill. The movie portrayed him just like a high school bully - Johnny from Karate Kid or something.  I know, I know, nitpicking. Better to have good actors than perfect figures. Anyways, fans of the series should be happy. If you didnt read the books you are missing out on a lot of good information, because in the movie we dont get all of Katniss' thoughts. I had only two disappointments. One is that Haymitch (Woody Harrelon) wasnt drunk enough. He is basically one sip from passing out throughout the entire series. Barely capable of speech. Woody didnt portay that in the movie. The second disappointment is that the flying ships did not appear to collect the dead tributes. This plays an important role in part 2 Catching Fire and would have been a nice setup here. All in all though I sat and watched the movie with a smile on my face knowing they did the book justice.

B004SBULWE|3.0|My first Android device was the Acer Iconia a500 with Android 3.0. I got a LG Optimus V 2.2 a short time later. At that time, I had not learned how to use their built-in memory mangement applications, or their task managers. This app is not inherently bad, and its very convenient, don't get me wrong, but the built-in tools in Android 2.2 and later, and especially 4.0 and newer (my tablet got the ICS update) are much more reliable and powerful. Its not a bad app for convenience, or monitoring free RAM, but Android does that without add-ons now.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|You just want her to win so badly; The only mistake is to use Stellan Skarsgard, not because his performance is bad (actually is excellent), but for him allways being the bad guy in so many movies.  You just think he can't be the killer, it would be too \\"obvious\\" not because of the movie but for him being the archetypical bad guy. The,  \\"David Fincher\\" touch a la \\"SEVEN\\", is just great, including the NIN (nine inch nails) reference in the T shirt.  The rise in volume when she hits the bar scenes makes the girl even darker but  more likeable.  I would have given her a new BMW black bike in the last scene with a \\"super bike\\" sound.  She definitely deserves it.<br />I give it a 10.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|This isn't so much a game as it is a gravity simulator. Its a load of fun, with recognition for up to 4 simultaneous touches. A personal challenge of mine is to ball up as many of the particles as I can and cause a 'shockwave'. I wish there was an option to disable the auto-pause, and for that, I subtract one star. It'd be fun to remove my finger and just watch the particles fly randomly. Other than that, worth a couple dollars.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|An old-fashioned ghost story crafted with an eerie-eye reminiscent of classic Hollywood fright films, HAMMER Studio's THE WOMAN IN BLACK is the perfect remedy for those seeking a cure from the usual fare which passes for contemporary horror in today's overwrought shock film industry. Bravely side-stepping modern \\"scary movie\\" conventions (gratuitous gore; scantily clad teenagers being chased through dense forests by faceless phantoms) the ghostly WOMAN succeeds by playing by its own haunted set of rules which transforms what could have been a mundane endeavor into a skillful and clever take on the haunted house genre which masterfully ratchets-up the thrills until going \\"full-ghost\\" during it's fright-infested second act.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe gives a stately and refined post-Harry Potter performance as Arthur Kipps, a late-19th-century lawyer coming to terms with the recent loss of his wife when he is summoned to a remote mansion in Victorian-era England to settle the affairs of a recently deceased woman's estate. But all is not well in the God-fearing hamlet of Crythin Gifford for upon his arrival, a series of disturbing supernatural events transpire which are revealed to be the violent physical manifestations of a vengeful ghost which is targeting the children of the populace surrounding the (supposedly) uninhabited estate.<br /><br />Not long after, Kipps decides to investigate further and does so by spending the evening in the foreboding mansion (alone). It is here that the witching hour begins in earnest and the filmmakers get down to business and unleash a chilling maelstrom of terror upon the unnerved Kipps. The house shudders to life and unleashes oppressive energies which take form in the fearsome guise of shapeless apparitions and menacing shadow figures. Musty corridors become unlikely conduits for horrific screams to pierce the mansions tomb-like serenity and disembodied voices whisper evil-sentiments which reverberate throughout its cavernous interiors. Scenes depicting the titular Woman In Black are particularly disturbing and are capable of inducing nightmares amongst those (like me) susceptible to such things.<br /><br />The production and set design are superlative and combine to create one of the more memorable spooky house environments of recent times: elongated hallways stretch forever into darkness; chandeliers glow diffused hues from beneath blankets of cobwebs; the obligatory grand stairway which creaks and moans with menace and spacious rooms that are adorned with faded photographs of souls long-departed. Additional tech credits are top notch with the cinematography aptly capturing the grim atmosphere and washed-out gloom of the cold and uninviting house; and the nerve-rattling score does it job as it keeps things appropriately sinister by hitting its cues and punctuating key scenes with auditory dread.<br /><br />Mr. Kipps eventually uncovers the dark motives surrounding the disturbances and the film reaches a spiritual and satisfying conclusion. But in the interest of avoiding spoilers, you will have to seek out the movie yourselves to discover the truth behind the curse which has befallen the town. The Woman In Black is a welcome return to SCARY haunted house storytelling and is tailor-made for viewing on dark and stormy evenings. So put away the Ouija board for a few hours, cozy-up with your favorite malevolent spirit and prepare for a night of fright with this spectral spinster. -Ronnie Jimenez, Pumpkin Patch Gazette

B007FG9LIE|4.0|I saw on anothe review that Pines was like watching the twilight zone and I think that is a good way to state the nature of this book.  I personally like the serial killer thriller type of books, but Pines was entertaining and not disappointing even though I usually read Blake Crouch for his older books like Desert Places.  Pines is a book anyone could read and be entertained as the twist takes the reader into a new world that is not too far fetched as to leave it only for fantasy readers.  If you are a reader of past Crouch books you'll like Pines even though he is exploring new territory.  I did prefer Pines to Erie for those whove read that one, this is better.

B008GOAFBQ|2.0|What we have here is a Bob Ezrin-remixed version of KISS' 1976 classic Destroyer album.  Not only is this largely unnecessary, it's a mess.  And it could have been *so* much more.<br /><br />The first thing that caught my ears was the added bits and pieces in Detroit Rock City.  There's background vocals placed in sections of the song that originally didn't have them (the Double Platinum remix does too but it's only one instance and I can live with it).  There's also several places, not just in Detroit Rock City, where the mix sounds \\"busy,\\" for lack of a better term.  I've owned everything from the original vinyl pressing to the 1997 remaster of Destroyer and it's never been an album I've had problems with listening to.  Now it feels like I'm being audibly distracted for 40 minutes.  Constantly.<br /><br />I can confirm the skip during the intro to Flaming Youth.  It's plain as day and throws the entire feeling of the song off.  Likely this wasn't intentional and is a mastering error but you won't be able to listen to it without noticing.  Unless of course, you've never heard Destroyer before.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the logic is behind the placement of the original Sweet Pain - at the end of the album - but this alternate, remixed, whatever you want to call it version that's in its place doesn't work.  It feels like the entire flow of Side 2, as I think of it, falters and never recovers after that point.  It would have made sense to place this mix at the end of the record, unless Ezrin's trying to imply that this is how it was supposed to sound.  And I'm sorry but the solo's horrible.<br /><br />There's so much more that could have been done with this release.  Live tracks or demos aside, it would have been a unique opportunity to present pieces of this record that you normally wouldn't notice.  Isolating the boys' choir from Great Expectations, the grand piano in Shout it out Loud, even the acoustic version of Beth, as presented in Kiss Meets the Phantom ofthe Park, would have been interesting. Ezrin's essay is ok reading and it's a good attempt at explaining some of these issues, especially with DRC, but ultimately it doesn't feel and sound like the album I've been listening to most of my life.<br /><br />So given all this plus the utter lack of extra material, I'm not entirely sure who this remix is designed for.  It's leaving me wanting, I can say that much.  One star because it's a classic KISS record and one for the different cover art (and if Amazon would let me, a 1/2 star for effort) but really, Bob, you should have left it alone.

B006LSZECO|5.0|The first 2 chapters are kind of slow but after that it's a barn burner. Witty in a Sorkin-y kind of way, rather than the twit-lit that is so much out there.

1577314808|5.0|Its sad that i came across this book at such a late stage of its publishing.<br /><br />Written in very simple language.  Its helps one to focus and live in the now and never to make the past or the future consume our lives.  We humans are constantly living in the past or the future and ignore the now.  The Now is real and is stress free...<br /><br />A combined simple theory from JK, ACIM and many other profound leaders.... this book is today a bible for me when i am in trouble and have issues to deal with.  It always calms and soothes me and gives me the perfect advice noone is capable of providing.<br /><br />Must read for every individual.... its truly a masterpiece.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|3rd book was just as good as the first two! I would definitely recommend this book to others. I'm glad that I didn't stop reading the series!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is NOT an accurate depiction of a BDSM or D/s style relationship.  Grey is a wannebe Top who allows Steele to top from the bottom.  Their entire relationship borders on violating the lifestyles principles of safe, sane and consensual.  Even though Steele consents, it is evident that she shows no interest in being a sub, serving a Dom or deriving pleasure from it.  Quite the opposite actually - she seems to fear his power over her.  As someone who is very knowledgeable about this subject, this book made me want to vomit.  It is a mockery of BDSM.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|2nd book was just as good as the first one! I would definitely recommend this book to others. I'm glad that I didn't stop reading the series!

B002NT3B52|2.0|It was charming to read about the author's experiences with dogs, but I was constantly asking myself questions and hoping the book would provide answers.  Sadly, that was not the case.  I suppose I was expecting much more science, and perhaps that is just an indication of the gaps in dog research.  Check it out of the library, if you must, but don't buy it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game so much. I'm glad they have this game for my device. Thank you so much, I just love it.

B0084IG7KC|3.0|The movie is good, at least 4 stars. I have a Roku player on my TV and it doesn't receive VUDU, and it is the only choice you have if you want keep this movie in the cloud, downloading to itunes is your other choice. There is no mention of this restriction anyplace on the box, not till you open it and read the instructions. I bought this from Amazon and I was expecting to be able to watch it on Amazon Prime (like The Lorax) After I purchased the movie it was available instantly to view on Amazon Prime, I assumed that is where I would be able to view the UV version as well, stupid me.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Rachel Joyce has written over 20 original afternoon plays for BBC Radio 4, and major adaptations for both Classic Series Woman's Hour and also a TV drama adaptation for BBC 2. In 2007 she won the Tinniswood Award for best radio play. She moved to writing after a twenty-year career in theatre and television, performing leading roles for the RSC, the Royal National Theatre, The Royal Court, and Cheek by Jowl, winning a Time Out Best Actress award and the Sony Silver.<br /><br />Rachel confides that she originally wrote \\"The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\\" with her father who was suffering from cancer and because she wanted to do something to inspire him to live on - not unlike the travails she designed for her characters in the novel to do the same.<br /><br />Joyce's story is about one Harold Fry, a plain and unassuming man who harbors a great burden. He has become estranged from Maureen his wife of many years though they still live together, albeit, in separate bedrooms.  Harold loves Maureen but can't seem to translate those feelings to words that would convince her of it, for it seems that too much has happened for which he is to blame as she sees it.  One day a letter arrives for Harold from a hospice, written by a former friend and worker Queenie Hennessy who is dying from cancer. Harold replies to her post with a letter that he intends to mail, only he finds himself walking past each post box until he becomes determined to deliver the letter personally by walking to Queenie; his trek then to inspire her to remain living until he should reach her.<br /><br />The novel is an engrossing look at all the things that motivate us as humans and how we perceive each other in the process. All the characters that Harold meets along the way in his journey form a sort of living thread that provides an anecdote for Harold's past which is shared with the reader to explain the present.  Be prepared to have your heart strings tugged as you get to know Harold and Maureen andas the lives of the characters and their shared grief are laid bare.<br /><br />This is an excellent dramatic novel and one I would highly recommend you add to your reading list. I would rate it memorable.
0800130952|5.0|I loved this move every since I was young.. I would recommend this movie to everyone \\") Danny Devito is the best in this movie especially his wife tooooo. Mara Wilson was especially great to in Matilda. This was one of my all time favorites movie when I was a kid \\")
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Super funny, I can't stop thinking about Danny DeVito in \\"It's Always Sunny in Philladelphia\\"  whenever I watch this movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am glad I purchased this as a trilogy. I heard so much \\"buzz\\" about these books I had to admit defeat & took the bull by the horns. Horny horns!<br /><br />I was NOT EXPECTING book one! To say I blushed was putting things mildly! I truly thought at times I was reading nothing more than modern day, trumped up, housewife pornography.<br /><br />Again, very thankful that I purchased this as a trilogy. I was able to flow seamlessly from the first to second book, where I became aware that this was definitely a thrilling modern day love story... it just happened to have a lot of modern love making going on!<br /><br />The characters were full of depth, the storylines from each book to the next flowed brilliantly, and held my intrest quite well considering most of the first book was definitely not my thing!<br /><br />By the end, you have truly taken a journey with this couple and their friends, family.... life. You start to believe & hope for romance and the happily ever after... the Shakespearean type of love that everyone dreams of but so few believe in. I think this series made more women believe again. Maybe the money and riches part are a bit far-fetched.... but I am lucky enough to have this kind of love every day. I endorse anything that will bring hope to the non believers!<br /><br />Definitely not what I was expecting, much better, thankfully. Thrilled I gave it a chance, I think more people should keep open minds... and hearts!

1579125549|5.0|The book is by Polgar, and the introduction is by Pandolfini, a well known chess figure and pedagogue. Need I say more?<br /><br />The 5334 puzzles range in difficulty from mate in x (for values of x between 1 and 3), to endgame puzzles and minigame scenarios. The beginning of the book even includes a short chess tutorial. Solutions to the puzzles are available in the back of the book.<br /><br />If you believe the best way to learn chess is to practice, this book is a must-buy
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|yea it skips and goes slow causiing u to lose the game and force close it one in a while but REALLY fan and cery much worth even with freezes
B008GFI4KY|3.0|If your look for ground breaking innervation & thought provoking lyrics, this is probably not the album for you. On the other hand if you want AC/DC guitar riffs, Queen harmonies & the vocal stylings of Bob Halford, then you got off the bus at the right stop.<br />It pretty much what you would expect, which is fine if you like good time rock n' Roll. Let's be honest they were never going to record a rock version of \\"Kid A\\", although there is \\"street spirit\\" (probably done to annoy the music critics).<br />If Hawkins & co are not careful, there is a chance that they will become a caricature of themselves, so it may be advisable to buckle down & create an album with a bit more meat on its bones.<br />The expanded version of the record has three extra songs added, which is pretty good just for an couple more quid .
B006CBSE86|4.0|Nightwish has really evolved a lot since Oceanborn, the earliest album of their's I own. They've become even more symphonic over the years and I have to say that their latest album is really very fun. I'd give this 5 stars if there were more vocals but what is there is very strong, very solid. The orchestral works are fantastic and properly bought to life by the London Symphony Orchestra. This has been an excellent album for my hour commute to and from work and I look forward to continuing to see how this band continues to grow.
B000FA5TTW|1.0|Began great...then dragged on and on. I got bored very fast!! I heard it was supposed to be an amazing book but I could not get through. Did not keep my attention.

B00192IV9U|4.0|but if you look beyond that, there are some true gems right here. I've resented writing a review for the longest time, but I feel like it's time I added my two cents. I know there are a couple of questionable songs here and for the longest time I've tried to make myself believe that it was MJ. I don't think we will ever find out if some of these songs are fake or not. What I do know is that there are some song here that ARE 100% MJ. I personally feel there are some \\"MJ Fans\\" that I don't truly appreciate these high quality songs. Yes this album is not perfect and it should never be compared to MJ's original works. However, there are songs here that are reminiscent of MJ's original songs. For that reason, I think it's worth mentioning and reviewing this body of work here. I'm going to go through the list and talk about each song in \\"my own opinion\\". For the \\"questionable songs\\" I'm not going to base them on the controversy. I'm going to rate them just like the rest.<br /><br />1. Hold My Hand with Akon, Rate 8/10: It's a a beautiful anthem-like song. It's lyrics remind me of \\"You Are Not Alone.\\" Improvements from the demo version that was leaked years ago include more instruments and more vocals from both Michael and Akon.<br /><br />2. Hollywood Tonight, Rate 9/10: This song pumps me up! It's a definite highlight of the album. The song's melody and lyrics reminds me strongly of the songs \\"Dangerous,\\" \\"Who Is It,\\" and \\"Blood on the Dance Floor.\\" I like to imagine that the girl Michael is taking about in this song eventually becomes that woman whom MJ speaks of in the aforementioned songs.<br /><br />3. Keep Your Head Up, Rate 3/10: To me, this song seems like it's trying too hard to sound like \\"Keep The Faith\\" from the Dangerous album. The lyrics and gospel choir are inspiring, but the song doesn't have the same song energy as \\"KTF.\\"<br /><br />4. (I Like) The Way You Love Me, Rate 8/10: This song is a remix of a demo titled \\"The Way You Love Me.\\" from the Michael Jackson: Ultimate Collection. The song is improved from it's original version. The song is short, sweet, simple and overall enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />5. Monster Feat. 50 Cent, Rate: 9/10: \\"WHAT!?\\" is probably what you're thinking. The beat, lyrics, and 50 Cent's rap, EVERYTHING on this song has powerful energy! I was surprised by how much I love this song. Out of the 3 questionable songs, this one is the most strongest. It's very reminiscent of \\"Threatened\\" from the Invincible album. This song deserves another listen to if you didn't like it the first time.<br /><br />6. Best Of Joy, Rate: 8/10: What makes this song work are the lyrics and MJ's vocals. This song truly shows Michael's versatility as a singer. Also one of his last recorded songs, it makes you feel sentiment for MJ.<br /><br />7. Breaking New, Rate 6/10: Here's the most controversial MJ song ever. Let's look at the song for what it is. The beat and instrumentation is good. Some of the lyrics are kind of creepy though, particularly in the beginning with \\"He wanna' write my obituary.\\" Considering MJ made this song before his death and the circumstances on how the media treated him, that verse is something most MJ fans don't really think about.  Because of this, It reminds me of Privacy from the Invincible Album and \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" from the History album. If you can look past the controversy, Breaking News is actually an ok song. It's not one of the great MJ songs, I wouldn't even list it on my top 100 MJ songs. It's an interesting song with interesting lyrics that probably wont tarnish MJ's legacy.<br /><br />8. (I Can't Make It) Another Day Feat. Lenny Kravitz, Rate: 8/10: Powerful lyrics, and powerful vocals from MJ. This song is a reminder that MJ has the heart of a true rocker. Lenny Kravitz doesn't add much to the song except adding short vocals during the chorus. This keeps the focus of the song mainly on MJ. It reminds me of songs like \\"Give Into Me\\" from Dangerous, \\"D.S.\\" from History, and \\"Dirty Diana\\" from Bad.<br /><br />9. Behind The Mask, Rate 10/10: This song is straight from the Thriller Era, a time where Michael's capacity and talents were ever accelerating forward, and he never looked back. This is one of the true gems in Michael's entire unreleased collection and a highlight of this album. Reminds me of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\" from the Thriller album. This is the perfect example of what fans like myself look forward to in the years ahead. Good job MJ estate, you deserve a cookie.<br /><br />10: Much Too Soon, Rate 11/10: If you don't feel like buying this album, but are only interested in buying some of the individual songs, Much Too Soon is a must have. The tone in Michael's voice is honest, gripping your heart and making you feel his pain and hope in a simultaneous mix of emotions. You can't get more classic than this song. It's very reminiscent of songs like \\"Got To Be There,\\" \\"Music and Me,\\" and \\"Ben.\\"<br /><br />A Total of All the Ratings: 80/100 or about 4 stars.<br /><br />Hope I was of help. All for L.O.V.E

034580404X|5.0|My wife heard about these books at work and mentioned she might want to read them, so I thought I would be nice and go ahead and order them. Well she hasn't put them down since they came in. My wife is not a big reader either, but something about these books piqued her interest quite a bit! Her friends are already borrowing them and returning them. We just ordered these! No wonder they broke Harry Potter's record for fastest book sales. Wow. I might even read them. might learn a thing or two.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|My wife purchased the Kindle Fire for me.  I was not excited about using it for I am no techie.  However, I started using it and I just love it.  It is so easy to use and the back lighting is just so pleasant on the eyes.  It feels odd not to have page numbers but it tell you how many words you have read and how many more there are and the % you have read.  It even will give you the definition of any words you do not understand.<br />I am really happy with it.<br /><br />Mel
030758836X|4.0|Reading toward the end of the book on my IPad while in the doctor's office. IPad said about 15 pages left to go. Turned the page as the doctor walked into the examining room.  Turned the page to read \\"Acknowledgements\\".  The doctor must have jumped out of his chair as I let out a squawk of surprise.  \\"Acknowledgements?\\"  Explained to him --his comment, \\"don't you hate that?\\"  What a way to end a book!!!  Really enjoyed the twists & turns of this unusual book.  After thinking about the ending for awhile, I thought this is the only way it could have ended.  Didn't like the two main, disfunctional characters, but it kept me turning the pages.  Give it a try!<br />Two different books this year:  this one & Defending Jacob.  texannt
B008BRC6NS|4.0|I'm not sure what people expect these days from a greatest hits album but this one lives up to its title. It seems most of the reviews on here were written in the spirit of taking shots at Jennifer Lopez as an artist. I think we can all agree Lopez is not the most accomplished or talented singer, but regardless she has had many hits and that is what this album is meant to showcase.<br /><br />Contained in this album, besides the two new tracks \\"Goin' In\\" and \\"Dance Again\\" are simply the tracks Lopez has released that have become hits. There are several singles left out of the collection such as \\"Baby I Love You\\" and \\"Hold You Down\\". While these songs may arguably be some of her better efforts, they are not HITS as the title represents. The title also says nothing about including any new remixes or updates.<br /><br />A greatest hits album is meant to show the evolution of a singer's career and artistry. \\"If You Had My Love\\" may sound dated now, but it was a fresh song in its time...as were the rest of the songs presented here. It would be disingenuous to update the song for current listeners when that is again not the point of a greatest hits album.<br /><br />This album serves its purpose, a filler album that reminds JLO listeners of what was and what direction the singer is currently heading. Expecting more than that is ridiculous.
B008GOAFBQ|1.0|This is garbage.  Gene and Paul had nothing to do with it because they don't own the masters of their original studio albums anymore, so this was done totally by Ezrin.  Yes everything is remixed marginally, so if you've been listening to Destroyer for decades you will notice slight differences.  But where is the bonus stuff?  This was originally advertised as a two disc set with demos, live stuff etc.  None of that made it, not even the already-released demos that appeared on the 2001 KISS Box set, let alone stuff like \\"None of Your Business\\" (sung by Peter) that was demoed at the time.  Where is all the live stuff?  There are countless Destroyer-era concerts professionally recorded.  Also, the blurb about this cover being the original 1975 Ken Kelly painting is bogus.  The original 1975 rough image that was rejected by Casablanca for being \\"too violent\\" is available on the web, it's the one that is seen in KISStory and on the KISS My A## DVD.  This version is a modern repainting of that, done by Ken Kelly in the last ten years.  It's signed \\"1975\\" which is another fabrication.  Seems that nothing KISS does these days isn't surrounded by lies and false advertising?  To sum it up, this is a massive wasted opportunity.  See the excellent \\"Deluxe Edition\\" series for how this SHOULD have been done - a second disc full of live stuff, rare demos, working mixes etc.  Not this ca$h-grab that ultimately, with the exception of one previously-unheard guitar solo, offers nothing.  Also : there are glitches in the mastering of this, there are several pops and clicks and errors which have been discussed in length on the KISS forums.  There is a glaringly obvious bad edit in the intro to \\"Flaming Youth\\" that makes the whole song skip a beat.  This is garbage.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I read quite a bit of sci fi and fantasy and don't often dislike books. After the first few chapters I had to force myself though to the end. I kept thinking it would get better, something's got to give...nope. Contrived, boring, and pretentious. Skip it. Read Night Circus instead.
B007RJUHB4|4.0|Florence, as always, has a beautiful voice and they do a good job of maintaining their unique sound while being unplugged.  I am very happy with my purchase.
1612183956|5.0|Once you start reading this book, it will be absolutely impossible to put it down until you've read it all! This is what a book should be. As a horror fan, I must say that this book addressed every fear possible and some scenes were so chilling, they literally did send shivers down my spine. The writing was so good you felt like you were there, experiencing everything.<br /><br />Even though I knew the ending was going to be something pretty unique, I still didn't expect the ending when it came. Some books you read and then forget about three months later. This one, and all the characters and events in it, is one I will never forget!

B007XNAOPI|1.0|Amazon's description is incorrect.  This is the standard gatefold vinyl edition, not the deluxe hardbound book vinyl edition.  Amazon fix your decription!!!<br /><br />I would give the music on this album 3.5 stars.  I don't think this album is as good as the Red Album or the Blue Record, although they are definitely flexing their non-metal muscles which is a good thing for metal bands.

030758836X|3.0|This is actually the first book review I have written, but I wanted to express my feelings about this book.<br /><br />This book is interesting - I was fascinated and wanted to see how it ended.  I read it qiuckly over a few day period.  That being said, whoa, the story is so bizarre in so many ways.  The ending was also completely unsatisfying.  There was a few loose ends the author could have used to tie up the ending in a very satisfying way, but she just didn't.  I am baffled by the ending she chose - truly baffled.<br /><br />I will not recommend this book to friends.  It was just too strange and frankly, kind of depressing.
0895260131|2.0|With any alleged American konservative tract against Islam -  the author must be examined first.  In the post 9/11 world, so many research organizations flush with neo-kon and Zionist money will say anything and churn out any ridiculous propaganda to put Islam into disrepute.  This is to keep the intellectually challenged mainstream American beating the war drums against a culture that in many cases, is far more `Christian' than any Christian land I know at this time in history - particularly this carnival asylum  the United States has become.  This is the `secret' that is being kept from you.  This book purports to show how Islam is destroying the `West' - the truth - is that many Islamic lands, despite problems and backwardness, are actually more Biblically Christian on a fundamental basis than most Christian lands, all of whom are post-Christian, today.<br /><br />First, as offensive material in the Qu-ran is not censored to the extent for instance, that Talmudic hate of everything non-Juidaic  is censored, raking Muslims over the coals is like shooting fish in a barrel.  It's easy, it gets you academic (quackademic) awards, speaking engagements, and honorary graduate degrees from respected `institutions' of higher learning.  A treatise attacking Islam calling itself `politically incorrect' and presenting a twisted world view to a readership almost completely ignorant of Catholicism and the West - is hardly a difficult `academic' enterprise.<br /><br />Second - look at the author.  In this case, now steps forth Robert Spencer who, like so many neo-kons, in his younger days he worked at  a Communist bookstore in New York City which, if you know anything of those days, was almost entirely a Judaic enterprise . Trotskyites later `found God' and now move heaven and earth to keep a western Golem invading and interfering in the Middle East to keep `Islam' at bay.  Following the neo-kon line, Spencer now works for the David Horowitz' freedom center - he's conservative on everything but foreign policy - in that case the foreign policy is anti-Islam because he is thoroughly Zionist despite that American foreign and trade policy should be cultivating contacts with the Islamic world. Spencer bills himself a practicing Melkite Catholic - I am very suspicious - I would love to know what religion some of his ascendants are.  Spencer is hardly a Middle Eastern/Turkish/Greek last name.  But that is conjecture on my part made from seeing the same dog and pony show repeat over and over again.<br /><br />The book:  It's twisted and utterly misleading.<br /><br />The point of the book is that `American leftists and Islamic `double agents' are working hand in hand to allow Islam to conquer `the West'.  The `West' - with its self-extinguishing birth-rates, complete removal of authentic Christianity from the public sphere, the Mormon cult, Bible beaters, mega church born again Christian Zionists, dumbed down educational system, the Jersey Shore and bobble head dolls - are being ruined by Islamic populations with higher birthrates, more restrictions on birth control and abortion, coming from lands where religion has not been removed from public life, where there is no such thing as a same sex marriage, where you can face the death penalty for dealing narcotics, and where traditional biblical customs particularly with respect to money and banking (i.e. anti-usury) are in effect - these guys are destroying us.  Yeah - right.<br /><br />From that basis, evaluate this book and where it goes.  There is almost no discussion of American foreign policy and its effect in spawning alleged terrorism (much terror activity is fomented by the very targeted nation against itself notwithstanding).  It fails to address US alliances with corrupt money powers in the Middle East, i.e. the House of Saud, or the government of Pakistan, which are in and of themselves, powers that act like terrorists.<br /><br />A large section of the book praises the Roman (Latin) Catholic Crusaders (Knights of Malta, Knights of Jeruselum, etc.) of the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries.  Indeed they are worthy of praise because often 200 to 400 Knights sworn to protect and serve the Catholic Pope, in a fortress were killed, almost to a man, preventing Ottoman army advances into Western Europe while killing tens of thousands of the Sultan's crack troops.  But what did those Knights do after they won the naval battle at Lepanto (which Spencer does not tell you) - Venice celebrated by expelling all Judaics from their territory.  Catholic Knights destroyed, or forcibly converted Judaic settlements wherever they were found in Ottoman or Greek  lands.  You might be surprised to know that Judaics were far more entrenched in the society of the Ottoman empire than were ever entrenched in Europe up until the last 100 years.  The Neo-Kon establishment which is so Judaic, omits this fact.  Another author has commented that 500 years ago, Judaics would be opening the gates of Christian towns to allow raiders and pirates entry within to burn the town and take slaves.  As I read more and more history of the Catholic/Islamic battles of the Middle Ages (and these were Catholics battling Islam - there was no such thing as this degenerate Protestantism we see today back then) - there are so many Judaic spies in the service of the Sultan - that even Judaic authors can't hide them anymore.  When the Knight Bragadin was skinned alive, a Judaic butcher cut his skin off - he was dead by the time the butcher got to the waist.  (The knight's skin is behind an icon in Venice these days).  As late as 1812, when the Sultan hung the Greek Patriarch from the gate of his own church for failing to condemn Greek uprisings in the Ottoman empire - after his body hung for three days, a group of Judaics bought the body and paraded it around Constantinople and then threw it into the Bosphorus River.<br /><br />There is a lot of truth to the author's statement I quoted before which makes Zionist oriented neo-kon attacks on Islam and praises of Catholic Crusaders disingenuous.  This is opposed to Hilaire Belloc's book on Islam which contains legitimate criticisms of Islam without the rank hypocrisy of this poltically incorrect 'guide'.<br /><br />In closing, there is ample material where you can read about the history of Islam, and that it was spread largely through the sword, and that Islamic raiders took millions of slaves from the coasts of Spain and Italy over hundreds of years - but beating Islam on behalf of a neo-kon is no academic work and a bent and twisted way to attack Islam which works the reader's detriment as well as his countries detriment.  The farce of current American foreign policy in the Middle East shows this amply.

B006L4MX0Y|3.0|In an alternate world of modern day Japan, the younger generation has no respect for adults or for law and order.  Those in charge of the government decide, for purposes of elimination and example, to select a 9th grade class each year to kill each other.  Only one survivor or they all die thanks to an exploding device attached to their neck.<br /><br />The leader in charge, assisted by scores of military accomplices, is in fact a teacher (Takeshi Kitano) at the school whose class is picked.  His brutality is evident in the orientation before the 42 kiddies are released into a remote island interior.  When one girl smarts off to him he tosses a knife into her forehead.  When one kid, who had for whatever reason, stabbed Kitano in the butt earlier at school, talks back, his necklace is activated.  Now only 40 to go!  Kitano does have some teacher pets however, which comes into play later.<br /><br />The concept for this film is a pretty good one.  Life or death.  No exceptions.  No mercy.  Each participant is given personal supplies and a bag of survival gear.  Some have automatic weapons, others have seemingly innocuous items.  One kid has a large lid to a cooking pot.  It comes in handy.  The action moves along quickly as each kid meets his or her doom, usually with extreme violence.  Some is pretty juicy but nothing as extreme as you might see on \\"True Blood\\" or \\"Spartacus.\\"<br /><br />Having seen many Japanese films, going back to those made in the 1940's, I find cultural differences hinder their acceptance to most Western audiences.  Much of this difference carries over into their filmmaking.  In almost every situation where one kid takes out another, hysteria follows.  One kid and one of the \\"heroes\\" named Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara), weeps uncontrollably after every death.  His girlfriend, Aki (Noriko Nakagawa) has more character and is one of the few sympathetic kids in the hunt.  My favorite character is Mitsuko (and the film's only good performances by Kou Shibasaki), who we see in a flashback (originally cut) being coaxed into sex as a child.  Her mission is clear.  Kill or be killed.<br /><br />The film is full of over-the-top-acting by nearly everyone except Shibasaki and Kitano.  It gets old.  Contrary to what many believe, this isn't the first film to feature people hunting people (\\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" from 1932) or even kids killing kids (\\"Lord of the Flies\\" from 1963) and it wasn't the last (\\"The Hunger Games\\" from 2012).  It is a good, if flawed film.<br /><br />I watched the film on a Director's Cut Blu ray disc which looks very good.  The film is in 1080p and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The video doesn't sparkle, primarily because the film has a toned down look.  All the combatant kids wear muted tan uniforms with white shirts under their jackets.  The blood splatters look pretty realistic both when it's fresh and when it dries.  The picture is clear and without aritfacts.  I watched the Japanese language version with English subtitles.  It is a really terrific Dolby TrueHD 7.1 mix.  Every speaker include the LFE channels will come to life, especially with the heavy automatic weapon gunfire scenes.  For those who prefer an English dub it is available as Dolby TrueHD as well but with a 5.1 mix.Shibasaki), who we see in a flashback (originally cut) being coaxed into sex as a child.

1466216336|1.0|First of all, the Dover Edition and the original edition of this book are great. Their positive reviews are accurate.<br /><br />This review is about the incredibly poor quality edition produced by CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. Their's is a very low quality, print-on-demand, version of the book which has two inch black margins, pixelated illustrations, and lacks substantial portions of the text. Presumably, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform is one of those companies that exploits the easy availability of free texts to sell print-on-demand versions with no quality control. Also, their edition is almost twice as expensive as the much higher quality Dover one. As far as I can tell, their's is listed first because they lie about the publication date and exploit some sort of searching bug in Amazon. This is a dishonest and opportunistic way to sell overpriced, lower quality, goods online.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on the CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform edition, buy the Dover Edition instead: [[ASIN:0486408434 The Royal Road to Card Magic]]

0525478817|4.0|This has been a complete blockbuster of a book. I can see why. John Green is a wonderful writer and there are many reasons to love this book. There were also reasons why this book is not for me, and I'll get to that in a bit.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars (love that title by the way) by John Green is a book about Hazel, a cancer patient, who develops a relationship with Augustus Waters, another cancer patient. The way they meet, how their relationship develops, etc is very well done. I loved all the literary references, and the witty dialogue is something I've always loved about Green's writing. The conversations are really sharp, and that was probably the biggest strength of this book. I also thought a lot of the medical talk was very authentic-- and since I'm in the medical field and rarely feel this way when reading a book, that's a big compliment.<br /><br />And now for my reservations. I know everyone has loved this book and I am very much in the minority with these issues, but hey, I'm a reviewer and this is my honest opinion. I wasn't as incredibly moved overall by the book as most people, likely BECAUSE I am in the medical profession. I think to a certain extent that we medical professionals get rather numb to this sort of thing because we see it all the time and if we were completely overwhelmed by it, we couldn't do our job. I think I was less into this book because it is so much like my life, and I use reading as an escape.<br /><br />A couple of other minor details. I was a little shocked that a method of cheering up Hazel was taking her to Anne Frank's house. What?! Someone could at least ask her if she was okay with this plan. Second, I'm a little freaked out by how Augustus is attracted to Hazel because of her cushinoid appearance from the steroids she has been taking and how this makes her look like his ex even though in reality, they look nothing alike. That really bothers me.<br /><br />Overall, extremely well written and I can see why it got all the glowing reviews it did-- it deserves them. But because of my background, this is not my book.ll the glowing reviews it did-- it deserves them. But because of my background, this is not my book.

0385742886|4.0|This is a prequel to the Maze Runner series and follows young Mark and his adventures after devastating solar flares have burned Earth.  Mark meets Trina, Alec, and a small group of others who band together after the solar flares to protect themselves against riotous mobs, people driven mad, and those trying to use the situation to their advantage. Mark and his new friends have only recently become a small community when they are suddenly attacked by a flyby with darts that have an immediate effect on those hit - death. But for the survivors, the virus takes its time. And it mutates into something even more horrific and disturbing than the solar flares.<br /><br />Being a prequel, there are mentions of familiar characters. But this story almost completely revolves around Mark and his fight for survival. There are occasional flashbacks while he sleeps to a time just after the solar flares that I sometimes confused with the \\"present\\" events in the narrative. But it helped to fill in the blanks of how he met each of his companions along the way.  This is a dark and violent dystopian series, and this prequel is no exception.  For those that have read the Maze Runner trilogy, it's obvious there will be no real happy ending for a while.  Yet there is a small sense of hope that keeps not only Mark going but the readers as well. Fast-paced and full of heart-pounding adventure and intrigue, The Kill Order is thrilling excitement from beginning to end.

B008Y5OWMK|5.0|There is so much to love in this movie. First the male leads: Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken and John Hurst (all at their peak) and the conflicted admiration and respect they have for each other.  Add to those, Sam Waterston, as the cattle baron who despises the immigrates because they are poor and butcher a steer or two to feed their starving families, and Jeff Bridges the inn keeper, another friend of Kristofferson's James Averill.<br /><br />Consider the grandeur of the film, which begins with Averill 's attendance of a graduation speech given my Joseph Cotton, Harvard Dean.  It took me several viewings to notice that his speech presents the central theme of the movie (idealism and the taming of the lawless West, because Cimino purposely distracts the viewer with cuts to the antics of John Hurst who makes fun of the seriousness of the speech.  This is followed by a scene of the graduation dance comprised of scores of extras in nineteenth-century suits and gowns waltzing in Harvard Yard (actually Oxford), which ends with a riotous free for all as the men beat each other as they scramble for the ladies bouquets atop a tree in the year.  The theme of beauty vs. violence, which also underlies the movie.<br /><br />And there is much spectacle to come:  poor immigrants perched atop empty train cars as the locomotive steam engulfs them as it trails backward.<br /><br />Then there is the greatest set piece in the movie, the roller skating rink where the immigrants circle while a Cajun band plays, ending with a solo waltz for James<br />Averill and Ella Watson, the town Madam played by the young and gorgeous Isabelle Huppert.<br /><br />All the while, a gang of bounty hunters hired and armed by the cattlemen is on its way with a list of immigrants, including Emma and most of the townspeople, to be shot on sight.<br /><br />I know why this movie didn't find an audience.  It's dark, sad, political in the deepest sense, and has no happy ending.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT THIS PARAGRAPH. In fact it has three unhappy endings, one after the other.<br /><br />But for its splendid characterizations, the beauty and texture of the cinematography, the beautiful soundtrack (including Russian and Slavic folk songs), the costume design, and a unique portrayal of the settling of the West, this film has its qualities.<br /><br />I've been waiting for this on blu-ray for years.

B000068QZK|4.0|No Rest For the Wicked has to be one of the most underrated albums in metal. After Randy Rhoades death, he was replaced by Jake E Lee but he left the band also. Zack Wylde was the new guitarist and Ozzy took a new direction, however this was before his comeback with No More Tears that put him back into the limelight. No Rest For the Wicked is the heaviest of his '80s discography. It's also very fast paced and upbeat, in my opinion Zack Wylde's a lot better guitarist than Jake E Lee or even Randy Rhoades. No Rest For The Wicked was almost forgotten and it only had one minor hit, \\"Miracle Man\\". \\"Demon Alcohol\\" and \\"Tattooed Dancer\\" are my personal favorites. It's not my absolute favorite or probably not even in my top 5 but it's a step up from his last 2 albums and a good underrated gem, it's only a sign of things to come.

I did find myself compulsively reading on and on at the start of the tale, however. Flynn does a great job weaving a tangled web of possibility, as well.  Great subject matter, gritty characters and a grimy prose that lends itself to the genre very well.  I appreicated how Flynn could make you feel disturbed without having to beat you over the head with gore -- subtle macabre is just so creepy!

0345803507|1.0|Honestly, I can't even give this book one star. I read the first two books, and I found the first book mildly fascinating until about halfway through. By then, I became bored with the interminable sex scenes. I hung in there (no pun intended) through book 2 hoping that the author would explore the Ana-Christian relationship at a deeper level, but sadly it never happened. By the time I started reading book three, I was beyond bored with the bad writing (seriously, someone please throw a bucket of cold water on these two because they are always \\"panting\\"). The plot was going nowhere, and I couldn't stomach another sex scene: I stopped reading, and I have no desire to finish. There is really no way that this book can end in a satisfying manner because poor Ana is stuck in a messed-up co-dependent relationship that will never allow her to explore her own wants and desires (those that are \\"gasp\\" beyond the sexual realm). What happens to these two as they get older and the sex-life diminishes? They have nothing in common, and they never talk about anything for more than a minute and a half. They can barely get through a meal without having s#x.<br /><br />I really don't understand what all the fuss is about. Epic fail.

B004TI1WME|5.0|I got this app because I wanted a virtual tape calculator.<br />I purchased the app to get the add free version.<br />This is very good as a tape calculator. When doing financial or expense calculations, the tape helps to review and confirm entries. This makes it easier to notice an entry error (android on screen keyboards do not give the same feel as a real keypad so errors can be made). Individual entries can be changed and automatically recalculated. The calculator is easy to read on my 10 inch Prime tablet, and works in portrait and landscape mode.<br />Multiple calculations can be performed on the virtual tape. These calculations will be automatically labelled: Calculation 1, Calculation 2, etc.<br />I gave this app 5 stars because as a basic tape calculator it is very good. This is what I got it for. This is what it does.<br /><br />It does have some faults or shortcomings:<br />Text can be added but it takes some doing. Select line, choose \\"Edit TEXT\\", type text,and confirm(OK): needs to be performed for each line.<br />Separate calculations can not be saved, copied, or deleted. All of these functions are performed on the entire tape.<br />The tape is automatically cleared in 10 hours by default. This setting can be changed to: Never, 1 hour,5 hours, or 10 hours. This really is rather a point to remember than a shortcoming (Don't expect to save anything for the next day unless you change this setting).<br />The ENTIRE tape can be copied to a note, but text added entries will need to be edited for spacing. It will be harder to read/track the entries otherwise (I like my numbers in a column, so I have to add spaces).<br /><br />The above items did not affect my rating, because none of these were factors in my decision.<br />I wanted a virtual tape calculator.<br />I decided on this calculator.<br />This calculator does not have extra permissions (\\"Access the vibration feature\\" is the only permission used by this app).<br />This calculator works off-line.<br />It works very well for me when I need a tape calculator.
B002QS5OQ4|4.0|StarGate Universe reminds me of StarGate Atlantis that had so much potential that was missed.  When did we start making TV shows that had more action in them than story lines.  Here we have a great premise for a story line that could go on for years.  However, starting with the first episode there was no back story which leave us confused.  That is support to happen.  However, I'm half way through the first season and I'm still trying to figure that part out.  I wish they did like the Avengers movie and did a lot of background with a good amount of action.  Maybe they need to find the MASH writers for help.  Still worth the watch because it will be referred to in future StarGate movies or series.  I'm just glad Ben Browder wasn't in it.  He was good in FarScape, yet he sucked in StarGate.

He tried to change the world around him and we see how people don't want anything to change.  This is a classic read and a one I would recommend for anyone to read.

The musical arrangements sounds hysterical, like the classics, Magical Mystery Tour, Sgt.Pepper´s band and Revolver. Despite this, they might be the perfect blended between MGMT, Devendra Barnhart, Poliphonic Spree, and Fleet Foxes. Good sounds for nostalgic and modern people.
B00422LESO|5.0|A great love story that keeps you wanting more. But warning it is extremely hard to put the book down! I hope the author writes more.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Awesome!This is a great game. I love it!!! Monster life is now my favorite app ever!Love it! I mean it is fun right?
0439023521|1.0|The Hunger Games book is both boring and pointless. This book takes place in the ruins that used to be a place called North America. There were 13 districts to begin with. The 13 districts tried to overthrow the Evil Capitol but the Capitol fought back hard. They destroyed district 13 and beat back the other 12 districts. To remind the 12 districts that the Capitol was still in charge, they created the Hunger Games. Each districts chooses one girl and one boy to fight to the death. I thought I would give these books a try. Everyone says that they love them. So, why shouldn't I? I kept hearing things about this book and the movie. My Aunt and cousins said they loved the book and so did my friend so did my friend, Annie, the person who showed me the Books of Bayern  is now my favorite books EVER! The Hunger Games are full of violence and sadness. All the people are poor. More people die of starvation then anything else. If I had only three words to describe this book I'd use : sad, violent ,boring or kids killing kids.
B007X4ECMI|5.0|Great movie.  I like it.  I am sick of watching all those depressing Sci-fi flick.  This is a happy Sci-fi with lots of Bruce Campbell and even some Duke Nukem. Love the action and the acting.  The story is nice.  Lots of Escape From L.A. and some Minority Report.<br /><br />5 stars.
B008CP93S0|4.0|Wanderlust is a light comedy that requires no thinking on the viewers part.  The characters are interesting to say the least.  Overall an ok movie.  Would I buy it, no.  Would I rent it for a couple of bucks to kill a Saturday night, yes.  In an age of reality television this is a much better alternative.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Well, this was one those childhood awakening moment after all those years noone told me the truth about snow white as this movie has.<br />Basically I have enjoyed it's entertaining nothing specific but different perspective more for adults than children story.
B007V508CC|4.0|Not the songs I wanted  but anything by Adam Levine is great.  I can't wait for The Voice to come back on!
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I was overjoyed to see this on the top free paid apps, and it is a great game, I just have one problem. The game is super laggy, from the start to when I die. At one point it even froze my kindle fire! It was a fun ipod game, but beware of the lagging.
1401937519|5.0|The book is about Anita's story, her life, her diagnosis, and her NDE, but above all is about how to live life NOW, a true happy fearless life.<br />It's an amazing message, I adored it. Anita has a lot to say, an amazing new point of view.<br />Love it!!!
B008IZ6G7K|5.0|Dexter's eye is sharp and his memory is just as good.  A murdered hooker is found under a bridge and Dexter notices that one of her teeth is broken.  It brings back memories of a serial killer from twenty years ago that he followed as a child.  He gets out one of his old childhood notebooks and looks up his notes and finds all the articles he collected about the Tooth Fairy.  Is he somehow now living in Miami?<br /><br />The Doomsday Killer (really a duo) has their next victim in chains and their plans for him are macabre.  Debra is struggling in her new job and is tired of Maria LaGuerta's interference in her management.  Masuka's use of his college students as assistants isn't working out so well.<br /><br />Fast action and good guest actors make this series continue to be entertaining and on a roll.  I liked this one and I recommend it to you!
B000SEFNMS|5.0|I found this book very interesting.  I thought it would be about some foolish kid that messed up and died.  That's what I thought when I heard the story.  But it is much deeper than that. How a very talented and intelligent you man could have made such glaring mistakes such as not taking a map or burning his money. Having been to Alaska and camped I find this story full of interesting things such as the people one meets in the bush.  When I realized that this was the same author that wrote Into Thin Air I decided to read it and I am certainly glad I did.
B008IZ62IS|5.0|The last episode ended with the police founding a symbol of Alpha and Omega and they are on the trail of Geller. There is a circle of fish surrounding blood and while Dexter is on the scene he finds a blood trail and finds the woman hanging in a greenhouse. Police trip a wire and she falls and his hung and stabbed in the neck by a collar of spikes. Her arms fly out and she has angel wings and she dies.  They hear a buzzing and open a cabinet door and a large swarm of locusts fly out.<br /><br />Dexter sees Travis in the crowd and recognizes the look on his face that he understands and is enjoying what has happened. He knows that this man is involved....<br /><br />Dexter finds a clue from the woman's murder but again he withholds evidence from the homicide team.  Meanwhile the Doomsday Killer (really duo) are planning their new victim's demise.  Gellar is no doubt the killer the police are looking for but only Dexter knows that there are two killers.  Dexter is on a mission to stop them both.  His detective skills just shine in this episode but unfortunately he is keeping all of the evidence to himself.<br /><br />The pace in this series continues at break neck speed and the plot is becoming more involved as it moves along.  This is a good season and so far the series has been excellent!  I recommend it to you.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|While installing the free version, it recognized my Brother printer on the network, but the installation drop screen did not list my printer model, Brother 465CN. After running the print page test, an error dialogue box appeared telling my free period had expired. I do not recommend this app.
B008IZ6OAE|5.0|The last episode ended with four horses walking down the street carrying four bloody manikins except that they are also made up with real body parts of the kidnapped victim of the Doomsday Killer. They represent the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from the Book of Revelations in the Bible.  Dexter, while examining the body parts, finds a clue and realizes that they might have missed one on the first victim, the fruit vendor.<br /><br />The new detective from Chicago is figuring out hidden messages in the Doomsday murders and he shows his intelligence.  He can still be a pain as he is not much of a team player but he is making valuable contributions to the case.  Debra is still struggling with the job and has to have her first press conference and she is very nervous.  She tries to do it naturally and calmly and, well she is just Debra!<br /><br />Dexter has a medical scare in his family and Sam the preacher and Dexter are becoming good friends. Dexter is holding back some evidence in the Doomsday Killer case and they even think that they have a possible name.  The episode ends with a gruesome murder that occurs right in front of the police and there are multiple biblical scenarios in the murder and crime scene.<br /><br />The tension keeps building in every episode and it is because of the new serial killers and all of the tension in the homicide department and their personal lives.  This is a great season and it just keeps getting better.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|PINES brought Blake Crouch's writing to a new level in my view. The story combines several elements that I enjoy in a story. Fast-paced, horrifying, and suspenseful, Crouch's story featuring a relentless protagonist thrust into a seemingly hopeless situation against over-whelming odds. I had a hard time classifying this book, since PINES blends several genres seamlessly, spending much of its time planted firmly in suspense horror. Still, mystery and thriller elements abound, along with a genre I will not mention, in fear of spoiling the book's unprecedented reveal. You don't want to miss this one.<br /><br />PINES introduces the reader to Ethan Burke, a Secret Service agent who regains consciousness on a riverbank just beyond the outskirts of the idyllic town, Wayward Pines, Idaho. With little memory of why he is in the town, he starts to explore his surroundings, slowly adding pieces of this puzzle to a scrambled mosaic of fragmented explanations and inexplicable coincidences. Mystery turns to menace, as he slowly starts to accept the fact that he can't leave Wayward Pines. All paths out of the town lead him back to where he started, and he starts to question the very perception of his own existence.<br /><br />As he starts to more forcefully seek answers, the thin veneer of Wayward Pines starts to lift...and this is where the story started to far exceed my expectations. Mystery and suspense yields to the sheer horror that kept me returning to the pages as frequently as my schedule allowed. Although the incredible twist is foreshadowed at points later in the story, I kept guessing wrongly until Burke \\"escapes.\\" From that point forward, I couldn't put it down until the book was finished.<br /><br />Blake admits to paying homage TWIN PEAKS with this novel. He does more than that. He briefly captures the essence of the disturbingly surreal series, in a gritty and often brutally frightening story reminiscent of the TWILIGHT ZONE. To me, this is by far Blake Crouch's best book...which is a tough act to follow after RUN.
B008IYOEZM|5.0|Dexter is still on a roll of successful killings of serial killers. But suddenly he is stabbed and calls asking for an ambulance as he falls unconscious in a parking lot. When the ambulance arrives and the ambulance MEDtechs reach him he rises up and injects them both. This is the first minutes of the new season.<br /><br />I found this new season to be intriguing and interesting with new characters and new serial killers. Some of the old characters are shuffled around in different roles that to me make the show still interesting. My wife and I are real Dexter fans and we can hardly wait until the new season is released. It is one of our favorite shows and so far for us this season has not disappointed us.<br /><br />Dexter returns to his High School for a reunion. He has some interesting experiences and he is also looking for a little payback to a guy that married Dexter's high school sweetheart that he was afraid to talk to. His secret first love that was unknown to everyone.<br /><br />I enjoyed this first episode and to me they all got better from here on! I recommend it to you.<br /><br />Please note that this show has graphic violence an adult themes.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I would love to be able to use this app since I am on Pinterest on my mobile browser quite often, but I am not able to log in. I only log in worth Facebook, and it just shows a loading symbol indefinitely. Also, on the mobile site I am currently not able to pin ANYTHING. :/
B008IZ72SW|5.0|Police are called into a crime scene involving a fruit vendor.  His intestines are lying in his weighing scales by his roadside stand.  Dexter arrives and notices another blood trail that leads down to the bottom of a hill where they find a huge amount of blood and drag marks but no body.  A new tag team of serial killers are on the loose and they will become known as the Doomsday Killers.  They have a fast paced agenda and murder and mayhem are in their plan.<br /><br />Dexter's sister has her life in turmoil, both personal and work related.  The stresses of all the changes are making her nervous and crazy.  The entire department is also in fast pace mode as they begin investigating this new gruesome murder.<br /><br />Dexter thinks he has found a serial killer with a perfect cover!<br /><br />This second episode is a fast paced storyline with a lot of action and changes in the homicide department.  You will enjoy it and the action keeps building!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have a lot of info and its graphics are greatest no headache yet from this app so I think its all good and it cool too.
B0007TKNII|4.0|I loved this movie. It was recommended to me by a friend a couple of months ago and now I can't get enough of the Phantom of the Opera. I would recommend the movie to anyone who loves musicals and love triangles.<br /><br />  Like any movie there is good and bad in it.  Unfortunately there was too much bad to make this a 5 star movie. So  in this review I've put some of bad that made the review 4 stars.  But don't worry I've also included the good.<br /><br />  Bad<br />1.  Why is Christine in a white dress during \\"Think of Me?\\" That was Empress Elisabeth of Austria's dress that was made for her portrait by Fanz Xavier Winterhalter not for an opera and her dress didn't go with opera she was in.<br />2.  When we do see the phantom's face it is not very deformed. Everyone makes a big deal of his face and then when you see it your like. \\"Wow, is that the best they could do?\\" It doesn't scare you or faze you like it should.<br /><br />3.  Emmy Rossum (Christine) gives no emotion to her character. She has a dreamy or surprised look throughout most of the movie. And when Raoul is in danger she does nothing but stands there horrified and quite when really most people would try to do something.<br /><br />  Now for the good.<br /><br />Good<br /><br />1. The very begin with the chandelier rising, is spectacular. The music and the color are wonderful.<br /><br />2. The music throughout the whole movie is beautiful, and amazing. It really helps you connect with the movie.<br /><br />3. The singing is gorgeous and allows you to really understand the character.<br /><br />4. When the Phantom and Christine interact together you can see the harmony between them.<br /><br />  Well I hope this helped you deicide weather or not to buy this movie.
0307472590|5.0|Sencillamente maravilloso. Estuve cautivada desde la primera pagina y no pude parar hasta terminar. Advertencia: el libro es adictivo al igual que El Juego del Angel.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I have a kindle fire and once I log in I can view pictures and what not but when it comes time to pinning a pic the application suddenly closes. thus, I cant pin any pictures and doesn't that defeat the purpose of the app? I also uninstalled and reinstalled the app but I'm still having the same problem.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|What a book, what can I say, I bought this book and didn't put it down from the moment I got it.  Amazing read, not at all what I was expecting (after all the hype and...quotations I had heard!  Loved every word in this book, I am addicted!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I'd heard about Lee Child, Jack Reacher and the dozen or so books with the same character.  I thought the scenario to be unimaginative at first, and then I saw them being featured on the NYT Bestseller list year after year.  When I finally decided to give him a shot, I downloaded the sample for The Killing Floor on my kindle.  I got to the end and wasn't gripped.  I decided I was right all along.<br /><br />Then I heard rumors about a movie based on the series being made with action big shot Tom Cruise.  My ears (eyes?) perked up when I read an article that the book that the movie was based on was \\"One Shot (Book 8)\\" not \\"The Killing Floor (Book 1)\\".<br /><br />Perhaps the first book was a fluke, I thought.  \\"one Shot\\" must be good!<br /><br />So I have a shot (no pun intended), and I loved it.  Bought a old used paperback and read it cover to cover in less than two weeks.  I started out reading it for 15 minutes on the subway to and from work, and would up lunching alone so I could finish a chapter and then another and another.  I finished the second half of the book in a day-and-a-half, thanks to a super long lunch and turned down offers to hang out with my friends.  The book was that good.<br /><br />Killing Floor was not THAT good, but it still cause me to think, puzzle, and put brainpower that should have been used for work toward \\"The Killing Floor\\"'s mystery.<br /><br />Get it.  Get it right today.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I was unsure about the book before i read it but once i started i couldnt put it down.  I read all 3 books in 7days!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is amazing! it allows me to view the temperature and my battery status. I can even change the battery color!!! LOVE IT!&lt;3
B0050KEVO6|5.0|This is genuinely a fun game. It makes you think and the combinations can be quite surprising. I like the free version as I saw no benefit from the paid version other than you are free of ads. The free works just as good as the paid. Definitely worth a free download.
0345803485|1.0|Two girlfriends convinced me that I had to read these books, so I ordered. Kept waiting for story and character development which never occured. Yes the sexual descriptions are intense and in some cases quite disturbing. The books are an endless stream of nothing. What a waste of time! Charlie Tango!
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Wow[...] This film had such great potential . . . .<br /><br />I saw this movie at the dollar theater, long after it made its run.<br /><br />The core of the plot was good, but it was degraded by irrelevant, moronic, scenes and dialogue that could only appeal to retards.<br /><br />It starts with an alien \\"engineer\\" drinking some fluid which tears his body apart. What is the relevance to the plot? NONE!<br /><br />A married couple find paintings and sculptures of six plain circles and immediately conclude, first, that it's a star map, then, no, wait, it's an invitation from space aliens, AND those aliens created human beings.<br /><br />Riiiiight.<br /><br />Most of the crew that go on this trillion dollar expedition must be the dregs of humanity, one of which comes across an obviously threatening snake-like alien organism and insists on petting it at which point it kills him and his obnoxious companion, a geologist with tattoos and a mohawk.<br /><br />The whole expedition has been financed by a dying tycoon who has bought the alien-created-humans idea (and he's a brilliant businessman??), and wants to ask them the meaning of life, yet hides from the crew until the end. Why? No reason!<br /><br />Then there is the metrosexual android which decides to contaminate one of the von Daniken graduates with alien blood. What is the relevance to the plot? NONE!<br /><br />Then his wife gets \\"pregnant\\" with an organism a la film Alien. What is the relevance to the plot? NONE! She then takes part in a marathon, a couple of hours after abdominal surgery.<br /><br />Riiiiiight.<br /><br />Then you have the two survivors outrunning a crashing ship. In particular, they are trying to outrun the longitudinal part of the ship. Do they get out of the way, sideways? Noooooo, they run lengthwise.<br /><br />Riiiiiight.<br /><br />Then you have a reprise of Alien (again) by having a dangerous organism inside the lifeboat, and having the original Alien creature emerge from the dead humanoid, alien \\"engineer.\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put it down.  I normally do not read fiction; however, my cousin told me I should give it a chance.  I think I finished all three in less than a month.  It left me wanting more.  What more can you ask for out of a book?
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This may be a mindless game for adults, but children love it.  There is some learning going on as they decide where to place their animals, what to purchase for their cities, and how to manage time to bring new babies into the world.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I have read several Sophie Kinsella (and Madeline Wickham!) novels and I think this book and Twenties Girl are two of her best.  It's a quick read but so enjoyable.  The characters are lovable and entertaining.  I love that Kinsella always has plucky heroines who have hilarious things to say.  A fun book when you need a little escape from the day-to-day but only have a couple of hours to spare. If you liked this, I definitely recommend Twenties Girl.
1594201927|5.0|Having read this book twice I am stunned by the bad reviews<br />This history of money also shows how nations decline<br />laziness, social programs out of control, unemployment, devaluation of currency,<br />high taxes on wage earners, loss of military power and influence<br />in essence this book written before 2008 election gives us our vision of Obama's America<br />and folks it is ugly
B0084IG7KC|4.0|The only downside to this Blue Ray is that it comes with the Ultra Violet version of the video file. Regular video files that can be used through Itunes or another format on your computer is much better. Not all of us can always stream data.<br /><br />The service for this product was much less than I normal get through amazon. The movie was released on 8/18 and with items I have previously pre ordered they arrived on the release day. This time the movie did not ship until 8/21. I will not recieve it until 8/24. The Amazon instant video file can not be used on my Xbox because I refuse to pay extra for an Xbox live Gold subscription. I hope amazon can speed up delivery and clear up the extra fees through Xbox.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|What a great song! Canadian singer/songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen sings with lots of energy and heart--and that music makes the number perfect! As others have said, this is definitely a catchy number with Carly speaking her mind about a guy she meets and what she's really thinking about him. True, this has been done before; but Carly's style makes \\"Call Me Maybe\\" irresistible and memorable. \\"Call Me Maybe\\" stayed in my head long after I heard it; and I even listened to it several times after I first heard it!<br /><br />This is a great introduction to Carly Rae Jepsen; she's going places fast and that's great! If you like this song check out her album by the same name.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|If you liked The Time Machine, Army of Darkness, Dances With Wolves, and Star Wars, then you'll love this movie. It's just so unfortunate that it died out at the box office (in the US aanyway, it did pretty good in other countries)
B0086700CM|3.0|this app is great for my kindle but I like it better on the iphone but other than that I recommend this app for anyone :)
B00499NHLC|5.0|Spon-on characters and first-rate acting make this 21st century version fun and intriguing.  Great way to keep a classic alive.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! its really easy and super addictive I recommend to everyone. when I first got this app I didn't no what it was then I started playing and when I looked at the time it turned out I had been playing for 2 hours straight!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|long time fan half brick studios and this game is a good reason why. freeium that you can play enough to not have to make in app purchases. play as long as you want, rack up those coins and spend em in the stash. the graphics were very well thought out, and the execution of the game is great. found myself playing this game for hours at a time, racking up coins, trying to beat my previous run.<br /><br />-suggestions-<br />1. up gradeable gadgets (gadget lvls 1/2/3) affecting the gadgets effectiveness (some dont apply)<br />2. coin bonuses for achievements.<br />3. show number of items owned in utilities. e.g. headstart owned or maybe even seperate invintory for items owned and number of said item owned.<br /><br />keep up the great work Halfbrick you definately have a fan-o-yerwork (possible achievement for owners of your other great games ;))
B006C45MRE|1.0|The movie was probably good as I saw the first half or so and then the Amazon streaming process did not work very well and we finally gave up trying to watch. This is the first movie we watched from Amazon and probably the last. Back to other sources for my video streaming.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was painfully slow then painfully predictable.  The author felt it necessary to explain the character's traits over and over again which made a book that could have been suspenseful mundane.
0785162348|5.0|I've got just one word in mind: MARVELous ! ^_^ This book is full of interesting details and wonderful drawings.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|my 8 year grandson loves John Wayne.  He has collected most of the great movies of John Wayne.<br />His bedroom is done with John Wayne; clock, blanket...pictures.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I'm actually very happy with my purchase.  The price is excellent compared to buying them individually.  I give it 4 stars out of 5.  My expectations were met.<br /><br />Every Harry Potter movie plays with no malfunctions.  Since I have a 5 and 8 year old who watch them over and over I no longer have to buy a one time play via the cable company or get the overused library movies.<br /><br />Be prepared that there is not one single \\"extra\\".  Each DVD has only the movie.<br /><br />Also be prepared for the cheaply made storage box.  It opens up like a old photo album with each hard plastic page holding two movies (front & back).  My 5 year old had it for less than a few minutes and broke it.  None of the movies were damaged but the \\"pages\\" didn't fit back into the box which was then difficult to close.  Maybe the Chinese could reengineer that storage box to once again hold the movies that came in it but my family is unable to.<br /><br />The poor made storage box is actually the only reason I did not rate this product 5 stars.  I read the reviews and mostly knew only to expect the movies and they work so I am mostly satisfied.
B002SAS26E|5.0|I love this game.... Under the hood, If you are paying attention, there is a ton of strategy to consider... When to pick up, when to trade, when is the right time to take the markets camels so that ur opponent isn't in a position to make a big trade etc I highly recommend this game for someone looking for a quick, portable strategic game for 2 players
1466401885|5.0|OMG!I can't say enough about this book. I started reading it late at night and couldn't put it down. Stayed up all night and finished it in less than 20 hours. I loved the intensity of Travis's character. The way the Abby and Travis are pulled together in a love hate relationship, it leaves you wanting more. This is a really well written book and must be on everyone's must read list if you are into romance novels. Two thumbs up to Jamie McGuire!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|After the first book I was inspired to see where this romance~relationship would go. At the end I was getting bored really. The story does indeed have very streamy and exciting  chapters but towards the end I found it hard to read the same thing over and over. I mean really,  how many times can you tell the same situations? Just different places I suppose. I wanted more of the history of Christian and how that would come back to cause major chaos. It did but it was short lived. It's like a B movie on TV, you will finish book 2 and then move on to the 3rd book just to see how it ends.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This one has a lot of quick links to other features like radar and forecasts. The only complaint is that it sometimes takes a while to realize your location has changed. Definitely worth having on my phone though.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I heard of Jetpack Joyride from my friend, Joey Witt and I just got it the first day it came out,August 20th. Five Star... Awesome.
1400034779|4.0|I call these books \\"Frog and Toad for Moms\\" - they are gentle, comforting, very redundant, and calm the overactive, stressed mind before sleep (hence, 4 stars). The author uses simplistic dialog, a bit monotonous train of thought intended to develop the characters, a touch of history, and an occasional shower of lovely description, to create his quirky tales. These books won't appeal to most people (why you see lots of 1-star ratings). Don't read them if you're looking for great literature or intricate plots. They are for tired minds that need rest and reassurance. They resound like a familiar lullaby for a grown-up frightened or worried \\"child\\".
1466401885|5.0|I read the book within 4 hours.. I found it difficult to put down, couldn't wait to see what happened next. 2 lost souls with many issues, opposites that brought out the best in each other
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is epic!  I think this is a great app for when you aren't doing any thing or when you're stuck in a boring car ride that's about an hour and a half long.  I enjoy playing it a lot,  I'm just stuck on the rocket ship game. : (
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Not very impressed.  First it required a download because there was not enough memory on my Fire and then I just could not figure out how to play the game.  I guess I should have looked into this on a site for more info on how to play.  It just wasn't what I expected.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We enjoy this game very much.  It is one that can be played at all age levels.  It affords us many giggles & laughs.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Loved this video. His best yet Shows both the hard and soft side of the character. A compelling story of overcoming the temptations of taking the easy way out.
B007OV9EYG|2.0|I got this because well..............I love the damn movie a lot. But the damn case came broken, it wont close. The package seems to be in really good condition and the outer box that slides into the case seems to be in good condition too and it was new also, but the case wont close, the stupid hook thing was broken. I love the movie, but you know what else I love, if my cases didn't come broken so I can protect the movies I love. Geez amazon, at least check if the damn case is broken or not.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Vampire Diaries!!! Yes! This is an Awesome series. There are so many plot twists and the characters stories are written very well. Who is the good guy? Who is the bad guy? Who cares? I love them all!
B0036T32LQ|3.0|The cinematography was pretty good but the amount of retarded decisions the main character made really killed the movie for me.  You should watch it, but you shouldn't expect a solid and logical outcome.
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|So here it is...<br />I've been waiting, (like so many others out there) for Destroyer to come out once more!<br />What hit me first, while listening to the songs was the much louder, cleaner and airier feel to the tracks.<br />A lot of small stuff comes through, like Peter's bass drum kicking on \\"Detroit Rock City\\", enormous bass sound on \\"God Of Thunder\\", and in my opinion a nice suprise...the acoustic guitar on \\"Beth\\", which you can here throughout the entire song! Nice one! Bob Ezrin did a very professional job on Destroyer, and sort of brought the album to our technological era, without polishing it too much or taking away the organic feel. A '76 version ready for the next years...so to speak. The '75 cover has a bigger impact than the original painting, and looks amazing as LP. Happy that amazon was selling Resurrected also in vinyl form. Bless the black circle!<br />The CD booklet is thick, very informative with an old stylish layout. Photos are interesting, but nothing really new.<br />Very unfortunately is the fact that, the \\"lost treasures\\" were kept to a ridiculously minumum. \\"Sweet Pain\\" with lost guitar solo/harmonies was included as track 6 and therefore made part of the original set. I don't think there was need to add the original \\"Sweet Pain\\" version then as a bonus(???)track. The lost \\"Beth\\" vocals (hahaha), which I'm sure many of us including me, thought/hoped to be an entire verse, bridge or at least some more words, turned out to be a second ahaaaaaaaa harmony, which was mixed into the middle of the song following the second chorus.<br />Really?? Probably the same ahaaaaaaaa Peter sang at the end, just copied.<br />Well, I am giving Resurrected 4 stars. Four members that changed the musical landscape, an album that belongs into the annals of hardrock music, and one of the best album covers of all time! Besides that the price, at least for the CD is fair enough.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|its ok its really tricky its fun and all but it not enough this is by far the worst angry bids ever who agrees
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I need US Credit Card to download and install a free app. Why? And european credid cards are not ok? What a joke!

B00701L5XS|5.0|Tying knots is an essential life skill, and this app does an excellent job teaching. The ability to advance the rope to see the knots coming together frame by frame is such a boon to those who may have a hard time with the spatial understanding of certain knots. I used the app to teach everyone in my family the bowline. Worth the cash and more!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I found this series to be enjoyable and refreshingly original.  The series seems to delight in taking alternative views of regular science fiction themes.  The series is done with a refreshing sense of humor.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|this works awesome on my phone. on my fire it is pointless. I can not sync with google. who has time to keep up with multiple calendars on multiple devices? amazon you make me question my purchase of the kindle fire
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the romantic storyline, but  in all three books, after the first revelation of their sexual preferences, I feel as though it was overkill.<br /><br />Enough already.<br /><br />We got the point.<br /><br />All of my friends felt the same way.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|It was a good deal. I would never do this if it wasnt 99 cents. Excellent quality would but more albums on sale from other good artists
B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to use, lots of options. love the notes options and the options for support. the journey can be difficult, finding other people that can understand helps
B000FC0SIM|4.0|Stephen follows the K.I.S.S. principle here, Keep It Simple Stupid, and it serves the book well.<br /><br />The first part of this book talks about how he became an author. This section was not only interesting, but also gives the reader an example of Stephen's writing in general as he explains his past.<br /><br />The on writing and what writing is sections are fun to read and easy to understand. There is not a terrible amount of detail or examples, which may annoy some readers, but if you are just looking for general concepts it is more than adequate.<br /><br />The On Writing / What Writing Is section of this book can be summarized pretty simply:<br />Being a drunk/addict does not help make you a better writer.<br />Art is a support system for life, not the other way around.<br />Writing is telepathy.<br />Read a lot and write a lot. This will help build a toolbox of skills, grammar, vocab, etc. Need to write a lot to be good.<br />Kill the passive voice.<br />Kill adverbs.<br />Situation trumps plot (i.e. stuck in a car, big crazy dog outside, what now?).<br />Don't force the plot, have the characters react and adapt the plot accordingly. Make it believable.<br />Use simple words and make the characters speak like real people, swearing etc.<br />Don't make strange connections for descriptions (google Fifty Shades Generator for examples here ;) )<br />Let the dialogue speak for itself, the old show don't tell.<br />Write with the door closed, no distractions<br />Second draft = first draft - 10%<br />Take 6 weeks off between first and second draft, don't touch it. Everyone has their own editing process, but time away is a must.<br />Again, show don't tell.<br /><br />I am sure there are many more, but that is a decent summary.<br /><br />If you consider yourself a writer or a writer-to-be then read this. Even if you know it all hearing it again won't hurt.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Let's face it, if you're a Rush fan you had your hands on this album shortly after it was released.  In terms of how well it is accepted into an already monumental body of work, I think the group set the bar themselves with the clock cover; 2112 it is then.<br /><br />This album is frightening.  \\"It gets in your head\\", as a friend of mine said.  Personally, I haven't had such a visceral response to an album in a long time.  Certainly not from a Rush album since...well, since I first heard \\"2112\\".  Neil Peart's lyrics have always been exceptional, but for \\"Clockwork Angels\\", he has sharpened his tone, and reduced his messages to their simplest and most elegant terms.  The lyrics are poignant and direct, and carry wisdom that is sometimes not easy to accept, all wrapped in a story from a world of steampunk inspiration.  Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson provide the perfect musical vehicle for their friend to tell the tale with music that demonstrates their absolute mastery of music skills.  Almost jubilantly, the music weaves the many styles from their past into new forms that are somehow as grand and majestic as the angels told in the story.<br /><br />After many years, wherever Mr. Peart went to seek solace during his arduous times, he seems to have found something, or it may be that something has followed him back.  \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is as bold in its imagery as it is brutally honest in its wisdom, and the message is custom made for each and every one of us.  Once you allow the album to completely sink in, one finds Rush's musical delivery of the story, and the underlying messages from a man who has truly seen the dark, to be almost blinding.
0671646788|5.0|I was so saddened to see so many negative reviews. This book is GREAT. It's a book that will help you change the way you think, and gives you the tools to change your life.<br />Your thoughts really do change things. I love this book so much, because unlike \\"The Secret\\" or many others like The Secret, this comes at you without a religious perspective. It's so refreshing.<br />Timeless advice and great book!
0345803485|5.0|It's not a 5-star book, but I wanted to tip the balance in favor of it.  I actually enjoyed the first book best, so maybe it deserves my 5-star rating.  Oh, come on, what do you have to lose?  Read it, at least to find out what the hype is about -- you don't want to be left on the sideline.
0307914550|5.0|If you are woundering what to do to stay healthy and young and how to do it, this is a great read. Lots of ideas as to why we are the way we are and how to overcome many health realated problems. Not for the faint in heart though, the ideas presented are not the answer so much as the doing is. I have been a runner in the past but have not been active in the sport due to the soarness that it created. However, this book has inspired me to add it back into my workout with some new twists. So far, so good. Takes some getting used to, my feet have been pampered by soft shoes for along time. I have been wearing shoes less and my feet have started to respond well. Still have a lot of miles to look forward to. Thanks Christopher McDougall.
B003F1WM2K|4.0|This  book was a good read.  It was well written and moved along well and was not boring..and I would recommend it to baby boomers who remember the east village scene of the 1960's and 1970's..
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|just down loaded, played a level 3x, just to see how game runs. works well on Motorola Zoom WiFi running JB.  have no issues with controls or FCs at this time.  Game is a sweet time killer and could become addictive.  it's a keeper, for sure.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I did not finish this book as it was trash and was poorly written...I would not recommend this book to any serious reader
B0083H6AQA|1.0|Robert Pattinson sinks this Guy de Maupassant adaptation, it truly doesn't matter how good his co-stars are, and honestly some of them carry their roles with aplomb, the tale of a vapid intellectual simpleton who.rises to fame solely on his looks rests solely on its lead shoulders. The directors (or more likely producers) decision to cast Rob in hopes of getting the much coveted lonely elderly women with too many cats demographic is at the cost of the quality of the film itself. Almost every scene that he's in rings false and the fact that he's supremely out of his element as to the tedious film's great source material would be laughable if it wasn't so maddening. If there were one silver lining it's that I caught this on HDnet Movies, so I didn't have to pay to watch this travesty.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nicely laid out and great gameplay. Contains a wonderful variety of customization options to enhance gameplay. Games range from quick stress relievers to long paced pattern game.
B0041KKYD8|5.0|Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton from \\"What Have you done to Solange?) is a write who travels to the countryside to finish her novel in peace and quiet. But some local boys have quite different plans for Miz Hill. Who terrorize, then rape her repeatedly. Trying to take solace in her rented house, she's attacked again causing her mind to snap, sending her on a killing frenzy. Pure exploitation plain and simple. These people who say this film is about \\"female empowerment\\" are just talking out of their asses. Others who complain that this is ultra-repulsive and vile are simply overtly PC clowns, as \\"Deliverance\\" is VASTLY much more upsetting. \\"Ms. 45\\" now THAT film is vile.. This is far from the worst movie ever made and is a bit better than \\"Last House on the Left\\" actually. You have to give props to any low budget independent film that's still talked about and debated on nearly 30 years after it was made. And as far as rape/revenge films go, this is in the top echelon of them
B005OTPKX4|5.0|Some of you might be wondering why I gave it 5 stars if this import is an exact replica of \\"Playlist: The Very Best Of Backstreet Boys\\" Cd??? I give it a 5 star rating because the songs chosen are the ones everyone's most familiar with BUT save a few bucks & buy \\"Playlist: The Very Best Of Backstreet Boys.\\" It's the exact same CD only with a different picture & cheaper :)
037582913X|5.0|My mother always read this to me as an infant, now I can return the favor to my 2-year old who loves it as much or more so then I did way back when. It's a bit one-note and insubstantial, yet cute
B002ZDOXM6|5.0|I received this CD a few weeks ago. I have always liked the Backstreet Boys and have everything they've made. I was happy to see a 2nd greatest hits collection. We all remember the 1st one, \\"The Hits...Chapter 1.\\" This CD tries to match that release by adding some of the material from their more recent Cd's. It's a nice mix though and well worth the $$$ :)
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne in this superb sequel to the great \\"Bourne Identity*.This movie starts pretty much where the previous one left off, with Bourne trying to live a simply life in the quiet village of Goa, India with Marie (Franka Potente of \\"Run Lola Run\\", \\"Blow\\", and \\"Anatomy\\"). and trying to piece together his nightmares and memories of his still mostly forgotten life. But shortly thereafter he is found by an assassin resulting in the death of a loved one, so now true to his word that \\"if I even feel somebody behind me, there is no measure to how fast and how hard I will bring this fight to your doorstep.\\" from the previous film, he again must take up arms and see to it that the people responsible must pay.<br /><br />Whereas while going into the first film wondering and slightly hesitant to know if Matt Damon could pull an action film role off, I want into \\"Supremecy\\" knowing that this was one part Damon was born to play and he didn't disappoint. In fact all the actors, from Brian Cox all the way down to Franka Potente played their parts with equal aplomb. And the game of cat and mouse was both thrilling as well as captivating, if there was one major flaw in this film, it would have to be the way that certain fight sequences were filmed, at times borderline incomprehensible, it almost took me out of the film. Shame because the rest of the film is truly fantastic.
B000YDOOUK|5.0|yes... i know they sound like AC/DC, but so what! they have some really catchy riffs and they rock! this album is good and makes me want to get their newer one.
0307987698|3.0|I bought this the same time that I picked up the original again (I had the first book as a toddler way back when) and it just isn't nearly as good. The inclusion of Elmo beckoning the kids to turn the pages is pretty bad. I would've rated it slightly lower but my 2-year-old likes it, however even she prefers the original.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|works well ... love the PC / phone / tablet snyc. Glad I discovered this little gem and I will be recommending this little app to family and friends.    Bought this in August, now it is December and this app has turned into the great utility of 2012 ... and now on with the addition to the review:    I've owned Evernote for a while, now -- Great product! NOT a 'little' app, but one that is full-featured and wonderful not only in concept, but in the execution of that concept. I even coughed up the money to go Premium. And installed 'Clearly,' ( [...]) their screen-scraping utility that removes all the ads and other superfluous stuff so all you clip is the meat of the article. GREAT utility. Notes from any of my devices. Saves my recipes, my hobbies, my website design tutorials and ANYTHING I want to refer to later. It is heuristic, remembers how I tagged my previous clippings of similar content and not only places them in the correct notebook, but tags them correctly.    I'm not sure I could live without it and certainly wouldn't want to. GREAT JOB, Evernote.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|I was fortunate to receive an advance copy of PINES by Blake Crouch. As Crouch has proven with his previous titles RUN and EERIE (the latter coauthored with his brother, Jordan), he knows how to keep the tension tight, the pace nonstop, and, most importantly, how to mess with your head. Just when you think you've got this novel figured out, Crouch pulls the rug out from under your feet and sends you reeling. Let's just hope for your sake when you land, you don't wake up in Wayward Pines.

B00727AM3Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time and I couldn't believe it was signed for so cheap! OMG IM SO HAPPY!
0307719219|5.0|This book really did a great job of theorizing convincingly about Why Nations differ in economic outcome. While it may seem easy to see if there is a ruthless king/dictator in place, the book shows that when upended, the new replacement is often worse. This book, to me, is about Extraction as much as anything.<br /><br />Incentives that provide hope for better and results to go with it from central institutions that are inclusive succeed in a larger sense. Creative destruction, property rights and rule of law are all fundamental forces provided by a central power to allow for such healthy growth.<br /><br />You need that structure but often the structure starts to support corrupting those same things. These authors really drove fundamentals like that home.<br /><br />It sure seems like the US is becoming more extractive in the last 30 years or so. But, it is not just corporations or the government that is doing it. Many groups and people are being paid from the productive class that are not productive. More and more people of all stripes are extracting more than they produce. Surely doesn't seem like a good way to go given the lessons of this book. The US is certainly not Zimbabwe and China is not really the rising star of the future model, but it is hard to imagine 16 trillion in debt and increasingly government representatives that sell favors through legal donations and rampant media bias and puff journalism to be a good thing.<br /><br />Extraction is the enemy here. And the numbers are off the charts. Reading the fine history in this book makes one realize how precarious and rare our fortunes are. Best wake up.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game is awsome this game is my favorete game I have ever played in my life it is so cool
B000EHSVSC|5.0|This is a great movie about Pearl Harbor because it seems, at least to me, to be an accurate account of what is happening on both the American and Japanese sides.  Both the sound and the color are excellent in this collector's edition.
031620157X|4.0|\\"Pain is easy to portray, but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world, no one had ever done it before.  Perhaps no one ever will again.\\"<br />- Curator, \\"Vincent and the Doctor,\\" \\"Doctor Who\\"<br /><br />That's what the museum curator said to the Doctor when he asked him where Vincent Van Gogh ranks in the history of art and to me, this quote is applicable when describing this book as well.  With Chris being new to the world of literature, he's not quite up there yet with J.K. Rowling, Ernest Hemingway and other writers before him, but for a 22-year-old, I think he's made a greater impression with his debut novel than anyone had ever expected of him.  Here is someone who grew up with not only the hardships of being bullied in school but in dealing with the fragile condition of a family member... and yet through all that, he produced a story with more depth than I ever would have imagined out of such a book.<br /><br />I remember feeling hesitant about pre-ordering the book when I first heard about it, seeing that I was older than its targeted audience.  Now I'm glad I got it.
B008CP93S0|3.0|Two of my favorite actors star in this movie, Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd.  That's why I gave it a 3 for them.  I guess that is why I was interested in seeing in this movie in the first place.  Glad I didn't pay movie theatre price to see this.  Wait for this to appear on cable.  It has funny parts but mostly this movie just gets boring.  Oh well.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is very fun when you are bored. so I recommend it for everybody at any age. funny game. I like it a lot
B00005JLEX|5.0|This was purchased as a gift. The recipient was extremely pleased. They really love Seinfeld, in particular, the earlier episodes, so this gift set was just perfect. It also arrived extremely quick and in excellent condition.

0062197258|4.0|Into the Darkest Corner is loaded with psychological suspense and true to life horrors.  There is a back and forth flow to the narrative that is a little tough to get into at first but it's worth making the investment and getting used to.  In the long run it makes a lot of sense and I cannot think of any other way to tell this story.  Once you pass that initial hurdle this book will make you cringe and eagerly keep those pages turning.  Catherine is practically under a spell when she becomes involved with Lee.  She sees him as strong and sexy, mysterious and a bit of a bad boy.  Her friends think that he's a catch and not a one of them can see that there is a dark, very dark and dangerous person underneath.  Once you are entangled with a character like that it's not so easy to walk away and even if you can get away, how could you ever forget being emotionally and physically damaged by someone you felt such an attraction for.  Catherine's life does go on but she is not the same, virtually a different woman completely.  She struggles with such anxiety and the only relief she can find is the demanding life of obsessive checking of details all over her apartment and other ritualistic behavior that she has come to believe can keep herself safe from the past.  One phone call trumps her coping strategy and you will feel the fear it leaves her with.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Wonderful app. Tells you everything you need to know about your battery. Like the temperature how many mine until you battery is fully charged ETC
B007SGM084|4.0|Books were good; however, I could have used more story and less sex, it got a little overbearing at times. I thought the third book was the best: Fifty Shades Freed. Worth the read and obviously I am in the minority with my thoughts, the books are 1, 2, and 3 on the best seller lists.
B001J4E1D8|3.0|What's even more tragic than seeing Tess' life played on-screen, is seeing it portrayed very badly. I felt more like I was watching a high school play with an enormous budget for sets rather than the usual high-caliber of acting I usually find in BBC mini-series adaptations. Having read the book, I could see that Blair attempted to remain faithful to Hardy's novel by including characters, lines and scenes that went missing in the other versions, and I give him credit for that. But the poorly-written script, rushed build-up of Angel and Tess' relationship, and too many awkward scenes made it barely tolerable to watch. It says something if you find yourself rooting for the \\"villain\\" to win the affections of the leading lady and hope never again to see the lead male's bare buttocks displayed on screen.<br /><br />As for the three lead actors, I have to admit I've never seen any of them before.<br /><br />Gemma Arterton as Tess: I was not impressed. It boggles the mind why so many think she gave a powerful performance when the only words that came to my mind while watching her was, \\"What the...\\" I think she certainly looks the part, but looking the part can only get you so far. It's the deliverance that counts, and I think she struggled to find the right balance in her role, only succeeding in the last installment. I remembered wincing at an earlier scene after Alec comes to fetch Tess from home to go and work at his poultry farm and they are riding in the carriage together. It was extremely painful watching Hans Matheson adequately deliver those lines only to have Arterton open her mouth and make everything seem so - I can't put my finger on it, but - weird. This unsettling, \\"off\\" feeling continued to plague me, and I just couldn't shake it off.<br /><br />I believe though that this has less to do with Arterton than it does the director's inability to extract the best performance out of her. You can catch glimpses of the depth of her acting through her expressions which were spot-on, but there was a disconnect between her facial expressions and her voice. I'm not disparaging her. She may not have a pretty voice, but the right director would have been able to reign that monstrosity in and make her utilize it in a way that would add to rather than detract from her character (like Sanjay Leela Bhansali did with Aishwarya Rai in Devdas).<br /><br />Eddie Redmayne as Angel: Oliver Milburn may be my favorite Angel Clare up to date, but I was ready to give Eddie Redmayne a chance. I hadn't seen him in anything else yet so this would be the platform on which to base my judgement of his acting skills. I have to say that I stumbled away from it all severely disappointed. There was zero chemistry between Redmayne and Arterton, but it's not to say that he didn't try. I think the fault goes to the director as well.<br /><br />Hans Matherson as Alec: He brought an intensity and vulnerability to his character that I found refreshing. However, I thought having the last scene with Alec be seen in a third person's POV was a big letdown. Alec/Matherson deserved more than that. That was a perfect opportunity to really get him to showcase his performance.<br /><br />All in all, it was a decent adaptation, but could have been better. The main leads played their roles adequately, but I just wished the director could have extracted better performances out of them as I can catch glimpses of their potential. However, I have to admit that for the most part, the last episode made up for the disappointment felt throughout the rest of my viewing, but that's not enough to warrant a second viewing.
B007G5K066|4.0|DISCLAIMER: I am not going to write a synopsis of the plot; the purpose of this review is outline the reasons that I bought the film. If you want to know what the movie is about, there are plenty of reviews that just outline the story and base their review on their personal feeling about the film. My goal is to explain why this Blu-ray is worth purchasing.<br /><br />Background/Story: I have to admit, I am a huge Gary Oldman fan. I will see anything that he is in because I think he is a tremendously talented actor with amazing range. That being said, I saw that the film was directed by Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, who is most likely known for \\"Let The Right One In\\". This is a story of subterfuge and espionage in cold war Britain, focusing on the highest ranks within British Intelligence. Now, I am a huge fan of intelligent and engaging spy films, but be warned; this is not James Bond. Gary Oldman referred to his character George Smiley as \\"a thinking man's 007\\". Tinker, Tailor Soldier, Spy does not rely on relentless action and explosions, but rather it is carried by a tremendous story and cast. It challenges the audience to actually pay attention in order to remain engaged in the story and for those able accomplish this, they are well rewarded. In terms of cast (which you can look up on IMDB), you couldn't possibly ask for a better group of British actors; it is not difficult to imagine these actors as accurate portraits of cold war British spys.<br /><br />Visuals: For those of you who have seen \\"Let The Right One In\\" or are familiar with Swedish cinema, it tends to be extremely polarizing because it's slow, often with long periods without dialogue, and a lack of in-your-face action. However, the author of the novel on which this movie is based, John le Carre, consulted on the film and was supportive of Alfredson. While the film can seem slow at times, there are often subtle visual elements that dramatically impact the story. The set design and cinematographyare spectacular, aspects that require a keen eye. The film has a soft visual feel, which makes the film feel more period-appropriate.<br /><br />Audio: In terms of the score, the audio is excellent and well balanced. I have watched this film both on standard TV speakers as well as a high-end Bose system. While there is some obvious ADR, the dialogue is clear and the sound does not max out causing distortion. However, I cannot stress enough the importance of paying close attention to the dialogue. In a complicated espionage film, missing a single line could potentially take you out of the film.<br /><br />Special Features: This section will usually make/break my decision to purchase a film. I loved this movie, and would have most likely bought it either way. The special features on this film are rather standard: deleted scenes, cast interviews, and a featurette on the making of the film. But, what makes this movie worth purchasing is the feature commentary with Gary Oldman and Tomas Alfredson. They bring to light some of the more subtle elements of the film that may have been missed by even the most astute viewer. Often, when determining whether or not to purchase a film, I consider whether it is worth multiple viewings. While I won't be clamoring to watch Tinker, Tailor Soldier, Spy repeatedly, I can confidently say that I will watch it many times in the future.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you do; you may be pleasantly surprised. This is a story and character driven film, so it is not for everyone. If you have seen it and enjoyed it, I highly recommend purchasing this Blu-ray.<br /><br />Final Rating: 8/10
B002VPPS18|5.0|This is my favourite Disney film of all time. Everyone knows the story so I am not going to bother with that. The reason it is my favourite is Maleficent,the most wonderful villain of all time. She is magnificently drawn by the artists and given a brilliant script by the writers. I have never seen a better villain in all the many Disney films since Sleeping Beauty came out and I doubt I ever will. The steelbook matches the film,it is really beautiful and in my opinion the best steelbook on the market.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|DISCLAIMER: I am not going to write a synopsis of the plot; the purpose of this review is outline the reasons that I bought the film. If you want to know what the movie is about, there are plenty of reviews that just outline the story and base their review on their personal feeling about the film. My goal is to explain why this Blu-ray is worth purchasing.<br /><br />Background/Story: I have to admit, this film did not look interesting to me at all. However, I gave it a chance because Edgar Wright is a great director. I begrudgingly rented it so that I could engage in conversations about it since everyone seemed to be talking about it. Boy, did I feel foolish. This is a great movie and one of the few films that I actually felt I needed to own. The story telling is so unique and the actors manage to deliver excellent performances without succumbing to cheap-laughs or outrageous gags. The story is unique and engaging and although it is geared toward the Nintendo generation, this is not a film that only nerds can enjoy.<br /><br />Visuals: The visual elements of this film are where it truly shines. The unique use of visual effects pull the audience into the story, while at the same time providing many laughs. Wright managed to utilize groundbreaking visual effects that complement, rather than distract from the narrative. If for no other reason, this film is worth buying simply because of the subtle visual elements and quips that you will find upon repeat viewing. The Blu-ray version of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World looks spectacular.<br /><br />Audio: In terms of the score, the audio is excellent and well balanced. I have watched this film both on standard TV speakers as well as a high-end Bose system. While there is some obvious ADR, the dialogue is clear and the sound does not max out causing distortion. The music in the film is great as well. Many of the songs are composed and even performed by Beck. Even thought I am not a die-hard fan of his music, it fits well in this movie.<br /><br />Special Features: This section will usually make/break my decision to purchase a film. The special features on the blu-ray version of the film are excellent. There is plenty of content for cine-philes such as myself. If I'm going to purchase a movie, it must 1) be capable of repeat viewing and 2) have special features that enhance the film. There are many behind the scenes features that not only include the standard deleted scenes, gag-real, and alternate footage, but many other interesting featurettes including Behind the scenes, visual effects, making-of, and a look at the music in the film. There is also a feature commentary that really complements the film and gives insight into some of the more subtle elements of film-making. Finally, the version that I have has the U Control option which provides a Picture-in-picture storyboard, as well as the Pocket Blu capabilities.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you do; you may be pleasantly surprised. If you have seen it and enjoyed it, I highly recommend purchasing this Blu-ray.<br /><br />Final Rating: 9/10

B0041KW2UQ|1.0|I'll admit, I mistakenly bought this item without reading all the details, which I rarely do.  I knew nothing about different codes for different areas (stupid BTW).  I paid a sensational amount for shipping thinking I was still getting a decent deal.  The product showed up as advertised, albeit I felt the seller was a bit deceitful by not highlighting that this disc is not compatible with US DVD/Bluray players.  I attempted to contact the seller to return the item a month ago and haven't received a response.  That's bad business and deserves a 1 rating on ethics alone.  Don't get duped by this seller.  You won't be able to get your money back.

I love it so much. It came right on time and I would definitely buy from this seller again.<br />~Diehardteendirectioner
030758836X|4.0|I debated whether or not to read this book because so many people hated the ending.  I'm glad I chose to ignore those reviews.  It was an intense read with several twists and written very well.  Although the ending was not what I expected, it was plausible because of the circumstances.  Definitely a very good murder mystery!

B004EPYZOO|4.0|Some movies are suppose to be taken serious.  This is not one of them.  If you attend this movie, rent it, or watch it on late night T.V. do not expect a high brow film filled with human irony, Academy or Film Fest caliber acting or an ingenious plot with a star filled cast.  No, this film is simply silly fun which at times boarders on the tasteless.  It is the kind of movie you watch \\"just because.\\"  The plot is quite simple.  Nicholas Cage plays...well, he sort of plays Nicholas Gage as a hardened and really, really bad guy who is dead but somehow escapes from Hell and steals a \\"God Killer,\\" which is a special gun capable of killing just about everything.  His mission is to stop and kill a crazed cult leader who has murdered his daughter and taken his grandchild in order to sacrifice the baby to meet his evil ends. He is tring to save his grand-daughter.  The `Accountant\\" has been sent to bring him back.<br /><br />Folks, from beginning to end there is almost not stop gratuitous and graphic violence; some shot well, others not so well. There is also almost nonstop car chases using very pretty classic muscle cars (Think Dukes of Hazard on steroids) which should fulfill the fantasy needs of the little Bubba in all of us.  There are a couple of rather vivid and remarkable sex scenes - one of which I have never seen the like before...Cage engages in a gun/saw/shovel/sledge hammer fight with about 6 or 8 guys all while having quite graphic and nonstop  sex while at the same time smoking a cigar and drinking from a bottle of whiskey.  You know, you just don't see all that many scenes like that these days.<br /><br />I lost track of the body count in this film rather early on.  I lost track of how many ways Cage is able to kill off bad guys.  It was rather amazing.<br /><br />The acting jobs; performances if you will, turned in by the entire cast were marginal at best with Cage included.  This film was not his shinning moment in front of the camera.  This is okay though, I really don't see how he could have done it any other way.  But as with everything, there are exceptions.  The actor William Fichtner (one of my favorite character actors) did a pretty darn good job as The Accountant.  He is Satan's minion sent back to haul Cage back.  He played his part with class and was the one person that added humor to the movie; twisted and quirky humor, I admit, but never-the-less humor.  Amber Heard did an acceptable job as the girl friend and is most certainly easy on the eyes.  The rest...well, to put it mildly....I have seen better.  Now keep in mind that unlike many, I am rather fond of Cage...I have liked most of his movies on one level or another.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert:<br /><br />There were a few scenes in this work that sort of stood out.  One was Cage drinking beer from the skull of the freshly killed bad guy.  I thought that added a perfect touch.  Of course there was the gun battle scene where Cage is \\"making love\\" while killing off quite a number of bubba-boy bad guys and never stopping once.  There is the scene where Amber beats up her abusive boy friend in a fist fight which Cage eventually finishes for her and there are a number of scenes featuring The Accountant which will give even the most jaded viewer at least a smirk or two.<br /><br />Now don't let anyone feed you the line that the only reason they watched this movie was for the artistic and intellectual value involved.  Folks, there is none.  To make that claim is like the 18 year old telling you that the only reason he reads P. Boy magazine is so that he can read the intellectual articles.<br /><br />No, every so often a person (anyway, I do) likes to watch show filled with mindless violence, improbably chase and fighting scenes and a hokey plot.  You really don't have to think while watching this one...only enjoy the mass destruction.<br /><br />Note:  This is probably not the best first date movie a guy should choose and is not a movie you would want to take thewife, kids and grandma to see.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarkswife, kids and grandma to see.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks
B007T2XC7A|2.0|The style of the music on this album is very different from that on her other albums.  Several of the songs on this one are...for lack of a better term...\\"mushy\\".  The term monotone also applies to several of the songs.  Boy...I hope she goes back to the style that I know and love.  :(  Disappointed big time in this one.  :(
0553801473|1.0|I pretty much agree with most of the 1 star folks.  I think George is jumping the shark at this point.
0823023494|5.0|A great book for character design - using it now for two or three different drawing projects. Very good guide, very clear, very impressive
