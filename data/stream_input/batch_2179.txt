B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follet's ability to write on historical events so that it becomes page turning rather than sleep inducing is quite remarkable. The characters, I walked with and cheered for and the history I came to understand like I hadn't before.
B006GECE9Y|2.0|ditto this for mini version. cant use this on my kindle fire, used on netbook only and android phone. bummer for that unfortunately.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|So refreshing to see a uplifting, funny, non-voilent movie.  Done beautifully I might add.  Fun for parents and children, or adults who are young at heart.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love Downton Abbey. I was a late-comer to the series, but now I've watched Season 1 and 2 and am working my way through 3. It's compelling. It is ideal to see the episodes in order from day 1. Love being able to watch it at my convenience.

B006VJMZXY|4.0|I'm a big fan of Philippa Gregory's novels.  Didn't think this one was as punchy as &#34;The Other Boelyn Girl&#34; and was slightly more pedestrian in the unfolding of the story, but very enjoyable none the less.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I wanted this app for me to use my camera for taking videos. I learned that it has many more uses. I recommend this for all kindle users.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|I didn't like the change of the way the last battle was faught. I think that it misses the mark as to the reason that Harry won the battle, but that's Hollywood.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just started watching D.A. and was hooked after  Episode 1 of Season 1.  I then went on to watch Seasons 1 and 2 on my Kindle Fire. Great show that I highly recommend.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I always have fun playing games by G5 and this one is no different. Although it's got a weak storyline (and who chose the name Moonflower for a characters name???), the game is still solid entertainment. You have to use a liberal amount of logic to figure out some of the scenes and puzzles but that is the fun! Not a waste of time nor money. Enjoy!
B0091REZMW|4.0|nice I like it fun to play nice graphics not too difficult but yet challenging enough to keep me interested.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|My good friend told me about it, and could not stop raving about it.<br />I remember when all of this took place also about the hostages that were held captive.<br />This movie was very entertaining and held your interest to the end.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|American Sniper was amazing.  I found myself laughing, shocked, amazed and heartbroken in the stories that Chris told but he did such a wonderful job of transporting the reader into each of the situations he found himself.  I love that his wife Taya was also part of this process because it gave the reader insight as to what the family was going through and the difficulties they faced when Chris came home, which were many times just as hard if not harder to deal with than when he was serving a tour of duty.  They both did such a great job of really conveying the feelings and emotions that many of our Vets and their families are going through and which so many of us can't begin to know or understand.  This was an amazing look into the life of a true American Hero and I highly recommend adding this book to your library.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book really answered some questions. From a whirlwind of political agendas to a side of romance with a dash of governmental mine control, i love this book!

0307341550|4.0|Camille is a reporter who has recently been released from the psychiatric hospital(although this is not revealed until about halfway into the novel its stated in the synopsis, so no spoiler) whose next assignment is to go back to her hometown to investigate/cover the murders of two young girls. While she is there she is met with a lot of struggles with her past and has to deal with her emotions with cutting, her mother who she has never had a strong relationship with and her thirteen year old, strange and violent, younger sister.<br /><br />Camille was a very different protagonist. I felt awkwardly separate from her during the story but I think that is how Gillian Flynn wanted you to feel. I felt for her in situations but I couldn't emotionally connect with her past history, or even some of her current situations. Her mother, Adora, was just awkward. Straight away, I felt there was something off about her... she was strangely disconnected from her children in an odd way. She coddled them in public, or when they were fallen ill, but when they were their regular selves she seemed to ignore them. Camille's stepfather, Alan was not present really and when he was he gave me the creeps and her younger sister Amma weirded me out to no end. She was the oddest thirteen year old girl I have ever seen portrayed in a novel. She was needy, violent, childish and moody. All at different times. You really couldn't get a true feel of what Amma was like as she was constantly having dramatic mood swings.<br /><br />I really enjoyed how you did not know at all who was really the killer of these girls. I thought I had it on lock until the very end and then I was shocked. There was a part that I had guessed... which I don't really want to talk about much in fear I may ruin it because I don't think a lot of people will know what it is. Also, the town this took place in, Wind Gap creeped me out. It reminded me of one of those towns that you see in horror movies. All of the people were juststrange. The plot was also a bit slow-moving, but then all of a sudden I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />To sum it up, Sharp Objects was a really good read but I can't exactly pin point why it's 4 stars. Gillian Flynn is a wonderful thriller writer, and her novels are just designed to mess with your head! It's really hard to review her books because so many things you think are not spoilers are intricately winded into the final plot twist and I do not want to spoil anything. If you like Gillian Flynn, or adult psychological thrillers you will absolutely enjoy Sharp Objects and should definitely pick it up
B007UXT6T6|5.0|Very good product. Just a advertised. Was worth every little penny I spent! Very happy with this purchase! Awesome! Pleased!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love it would like it better if it had a few more challenging games but fun all the same. Its a keeper!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I wanted to see what all the Downton Abbey hysteria was about so I watched the first episode on my Kindle Fire for free with my Prime membership.  I recently finished Season 2 and cannot wait to begin watching Season 3.  Downton Abbey is well-written and I especially enjoy the dichotomy between the Crawley family and the staff.  The characters are interesting and each has his/her own story line. I highly recommend Downton Abbey.
1616550414|5.0|of art from the new games and a few pages of the classic. I could have used more art from the classic 8bit games. But the art is old and most likely no longer around.  A must have for any Zelda fan. It's a huge book. Full
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a fun game and fairly addictive, and even my husband enjoys playing.  Time really flies when playing this!
014241493X|5.0|Great writing style. Can easily read through many chapters in one sitting. Great story, easy read. Very nostalgic memories keep coming up while reading.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just finished this book. Towards the end I could not put it down. It had me racing through the pages to find out what happened next. I found myself becoming Q as he broke the mystery. I found myself sad once the book ended, wanting it to go on. This will be the first book I re-read. Absolute 5 stars.
B002N2LEVM|4.0|The second season really came together to finish strong. I loved it!!! The best part was that they wrapped up any loose ends, giving the series an ending!
0307463745|5.0|Mark Cuban said it the best... he would choose someone who read this book compared to somoene that has gotten their MBA... idk how true that is for all of America, but I tend to listen to what the Shark has to say. On top of that, I use the software that this comapny created &#34;basecamp&#34; so it's kinda cool to know where it came from.
B00BESCJII|5.0|This movie had so much depth and meaning, but still had it's laugh out load moments, would definitely see it again
1476715904|5.0|Omg.. All I can say is you must read this book. I cried I laughed and cried and laughed. I love how will and lake were instantly touchy Feeley with each other. I loved how through my tears I was also laughing. A total mix of emotions. I felt Lakes pain as she roars out her poem of hate. I feel when Will pours out his soul to lake and Eddie. Every person in this book has a part and they all fit into this perfect package that is slammed. I really didn't say much about the story because.. Well, you really just have to read it and experience it all first hand. You will fall head over heals.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|Call me a prude, but I don't enjoy books about married people having an affair.  Sparks tries to make the affair seem like good thing because the person is in a bad marriage.  Another ghost story, as well.  I think he needs to stick with what made him popular and that is true love stories, like The Notebook and Message in a Bottle.  I did enjoy Safe Haven because it was a new twist, but it seems like every time he has a hit, it's followed by a mediocre book that is a repeat of his previous hit.  All in all, not a horrible book, but you might just want to check it out at the library.
1452113432|5.0|Reading this book is like spending the day with Rachel in Paris. Every recipe I have tried has been amazing. Love, love this book!
B007ZLKK9I|3.0|I watched the first half with my 13 year old daughter and found myself stopping the video every 15 minutes to provide context.  Throughout the movie I found that there was vague allusion to events that took place or things George did - such as drug use contributing to his poor vocal performance during his 70s concert tour - but it never got specific.  What was the extent of George's unfaithfulness to Olivia?  Was he a serial adulterer?<br /><br />Alternatively, there would be contradictory narrative - such as Clapton saying George gave his blessing for Eric to be with Patty.  Yet, a few minutes later, George gets angry at Eric and Patty for acting on their feelings.  Why the confusion?<br /><br />I did think it was good at highlighting the complex nature of George (and the love/devotion he had from friends).  However, it never satisfactorily resolved/reconciled his deep spiritual quest with his earthly/base practices.<br /><br />The prior feedback aside, it was a moving piece.  If you don't shed a tear at the end when Ringo last saw George, you may not be human.
B003CBVU30|2.0|Pedantic humor (at best) that will garner a chuckle or two. Two hours lost that I won't get back. (Licking trees?  Really?)
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show, we love it...a bit gross at some places but what do you expect...they are zombies!  May give some younger kids sleeping issues...definitely not for kids under 5...ok, 12...,,,parents watch an episode first sans kids....
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its very fun because I have all ready unlocked all the people its easy u just get lots of coins yaaaaaaaaa I love this game
B00797MB0O|3.0|Ms Theron did a good job portraying an unlikable character who could be beautiful at times or ugly at others.
B00004TJWE|4.0|I'd heard so much about this album and eventually decided to buy it. I can hear how it influenced Pete Townshend with Tommy but there are a ton of references from other artists contained within various lyrics on this recording. Of course Beatle references abound as they pretty much permeated society at that time.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is an essential recording to own but it does have some fantastic moments.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie and even better finale to the trilogy. It really brings all aspects of the three movies together. The musical score of this film is outstanding as well. Well rounded film!
B0013D8LCW|4.0|I've had this film for years, and I enjoy it each time I watch it.<br /><br />This film relies heavily on the scenery and the actors (I suppose if the director cut out all the driving/surfing/skating scenes it would be about 30 minutes long).<br /><br />Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright do such a great job and their on screen chemistry is just right for this, Tina Holmes is great (I really love/hated that character), and Ross Thomas' character seems to take over the scenes he's in.<br /><br />Probably the worst thing about the film is that it had the potential to be/do so much more as a film and for the community, but then again maybe that's part of why I like it.  It's romance and coming out without all the sex, political issues, or blatant ignorance that some films get wrapped up in.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Sinister is for sure one of the best horror films I've seen in the last decade.  It's an original, well-contructed story that's quite disturbing.  It's not without it's issues though.  If you've ever yelled at the girl for running back into the house where the killer is, you'll for sure spend 90% of this film yelling at Ethan Hawke to turn a light on in his house.  Most of this movie occurs in the dark, which sets the proper mood, but defies all logic.  Hawke literally walks past light switches to investigate strange happenings.  It took me out of the movie at times.  No one was ever killed in my home, but I still turn lights on when I enter rooms- not because I'm scared, but so I can &#34;see&#34;.  All that aside, I would definitely recommend this film.  Again, one of the best I've seen in a long time.
0425263908|4.0|It was a good read. Can not to read the next book. The characters were very intense. hey very good storyline.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I have had nothing but trouble trying to use this package.  Not user friendly at all.  I would not recommend this
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Great book with valuable information to change your life.  The examples given are inspirational and motivating. It is a must read.
0156012197|5.0|This book is my favorite book through my childhood.<br />I hope that my two daughters could enjoy this book as much as me.
1589269071|3.0|Product was great however, when ordering I was confused by the questions in formating.  I ordered them to listen to them on a cross country car ride.  What I recieved I have to listen to with a computer or DVD player, it would not work in car stereo or a walkman type CD player.  My daughter works on computers and she didn't know what format to order either so I don't think it was us.  It didn't ask DVD or CD and any audio CD should play in car stereo.  That's pretty much the idea of audio formatting.
B000R7I3LY|3.0|I have listened to both \\"Careful Confessions\\" and \\"Little Voice\\" through many systems I have<br />spread throughout my house from Boom Boxes to Stanton S.300 to Powered monitors, from PC<br />to powered monitors, and so on, right down to running it through my Sony CDP-CE375 and Phonic 740 set up in my studio.<br />My only conclusion, is that Sara needs to find herself a better sound studio to do her<br />mixing/recording, as both of these CD's come off as muddy with very little separation.<br />I have Kaleidoscope Heart coming in next, as I want to play the bass guitar along with \\"Gonna get<br />over you\\" which has a killer old school bass rhythm/riff.<br />Sara is a new discovery for me, as I caught this last song on my local \\"Vinyl\\" station and was off with a new pop singer to ponder over.<br />I don't have any $3K Dolby whiz banger systems in the house, so one of these could possibly make the CD's sound better, but with a VERY LARGE LIBRARY of Rock, Pop, Jazz, and Blues CD's, and being<br />a professional musician for over 40 years, my ear is pretty good.<br />Don't get me wrong, I love her music just as I did when I first heard Amy Winehouse many years ago.<br />I'm sure Sara will take better care of herself than Amy did, and sings Pop instead of Blues/Jazz.<br />With all of this said, it just irritates me when a voice like this is presented to the public using<br />rank amateurs to do her studio work.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|I was hesitant to order used DVD's but I probably won't get new again.  Out of this set, there was one really fine, small mark on one DVD and it plays like new.  Very impressed and shipped quickly.  I will look for items from this seller in future purchases.
B004YF6MHW|2.0|I've compared the quality of images this camera produces to several other camera apps and the results were pretty disappointing for Camera Zoom FX. When expanded to their full resolution for better comparison Camera Zoom images were the blurriest, with least preserved detail, and the most artifacts. I would guess this may have something to do with image compression algorithm this app uses, or it could be something else. Who cares really, when the results speak for themselves.<br /><br />However if what you're looking for is the ability to take some low-res shots with some filters applied on the fly, this app is ok (although it does take forever to start-up). Why you'd want to pay money for this is the question, with such a plethora of free apps that do the exact same thing.<br /><br />My phone is the SGS2.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app. will keep you happy and up to date with its User friendly functions.<br />I really could not be more pleased with this app.<br />Thank you EVERNOTE...you have a WINNER.<br />Your logo actually says it all!!!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Im hooked....cant wait for season three to be available. If you like Sci-Fi, this will certainly be a good choice for you.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I think Elementary is a great series. I have enjoyed the good writing with many a good twist to the plot. The acting is also first rate.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A must read for everyone!! Incredible detailed writting of a very personal experience risking his reputation for his lifetime work as a neurosugeon. Well Done!!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|We received a tip that we should rent the DVD &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34;.  Once we watched the movie and I heard just small portions of his music, I wanted more.  I was a little apprehensive about what the quality of the CD's might be (I bought Coming From Reality, also), but I shouldn't have worried.  His music brought back memories of the 60's and 70's, but the way he used words to create his stories was incredible.  There is only one song I'm not incredibly fond of on this CD because they tried to bring the psychedelic (sp) sound into his music, but it's still interesting.  &#34;I Wonder&#34; is definitely my favorite.  Not sure who to compare him to - you just need to rent the DVD first to truly enjoy the music and the man who created it.
B009CFKB0S|5.0|If you love satirical comedies, don't get offended easily, and can sit through long-building plots, this movie is for you! George Clooney really shows his wide range in skills in this movie, making you bust a gut whether he's delivering a clever monologue or playing off his co-stars. Anna Kindrick flawlessly displays the various facets of a complex character, portraying a young, uptight over-achiever who can also have you rolling on the floor as she brilliantly displays the naive heartbreak of a wide-eyed young adult trying to make sense of her world while attempting to hold together her &#34;adult&#34; composure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and entertaining. I never get tired of playing it because it has so many obstacles. I can play a game like this all day. :)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book as great it took me less than a week. The only reason i did not like it was because of the ending it just ended and I think it should have continued to show what happened after.
B002G1YPH0|2.0|One of the plastic &#34;fan mount&#34; was broken in pieces upon opening the box. Tried to attach the spare, and it cracked on the screw hole. Good thing CM included 2x of these &#34;fan mount&#34; in the box.<br /><br />Installation was somewhat tricky.<br /><br />Cools okay. i7-3770 idles at 40 C.
B000HKYA1I|4.0|A young man returns to the former USSR (Ukraine) with the aim of finding the birthplace of his grandfather, a Jew who escaped just prior to the Nazi invasion of that area.  Some 60 years after the events of that time and having grown up in a completely different world, the main character has ostensibly no real emotional connection to them and no clear intent except to collect and document &#34;memories.&#34;<br /><br />Juxtiposed to this an even more disconnected pair of Ukrainian guides for whom the car journey is only a way of making a living.<br /><br />Along the way we find that each of the characters do yet retain enough of what it takes to be a real participent in this life to be able to take in the unexpected final denoument.  This ending, while deeply disturbing will not fail to satisfy one's need for a raison d'et for the storyteller to have made the movie in the first place.  i consider this a &#34;must see&#34; -- especially for the new generation of &#34;millenials&#34;, who may need to see that the atrocities happening in the world today are not that far from home.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly's long-running character LAPD detective Harry Bosch doesn't let the fact that a murder victim has been dead for 20 years stop him from risking all to solve the crime. Bosch was there in 1992, as riots rocked the city of Los Angeles in the wake of the Rodney King police beating verdicts, when a young Danish photojournalist's body was found in alley. It is a war zone with National Guard troops patrolling the streets. Bosch and his partner have 15 minutes to work the scene before heading off to the next homicide. Twenty years later, Bosch is working the Open-Unsolved Unit when the file of Anneke Jespersen crosses his desk.<br />Those who have followed Connelly's Bosch through the years know the character has been allowed to evolve and age, not always gracefully. The Black Box gives readers a chance to see he is determined as ever, as well as catch up with daughter Maddie as she grows up, and see how Bosch is faring as a single father. We also get an update on his oft-troubled relationship with girlfriend Hannah Stone. Harry, if you're listening, I see nothing but trouble with this Stone woman. Just saying.<br />Five stars? Four stars? It is hard to choose. Connelly does his usual fine job of spinning an intriguing tale, while letting the reader feel empathy for a victim they do not meet until long after she is dead. While the Black Box is not Connelly's best work, it is a worthy read.
B0071BGOJC|3.0|I am a big fan of Ken Follett's books, but this one disappoints. Probably too many characters and storyline slow moving
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If I could give this book more stars ... I would.  Just loved the book and the movie!!  Romance, mystery and quite a twist at the end ...
B0066W1AZK|5.0|The game is great and free! Playing nonlinear on an app is great! It has different times and it has a tactic trainer that changes! I recommend this app for chess lovers
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I love this show and couldnt wait to get it on dvd to watch it all over again! Price was great..much cheaper than in the store!  Have to get season 2 now!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The movie is OK.  Not a WOW in my opinion.  Guess I will always be comparing Daniel Craig to Sean Connery, but for me there is something lacking in Daniel.  I can't put my finger on it.  Something sexy, mysterious and suave just isn't there.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Pros: Blu-ray and all of the movies in one bundle what else needs to be said.  Great collection I have watched over and over again.  You would laugh if you knew how old I am.  Nice to sink into a fantasy world for a while.<br />The Blu-ray case is simple and fine if you aren't trying to purchase the collector's edition.  This edition is very nice if you only want to watch the movies.<br /><br />Cons: Can't think of any at this time.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book and the perspective from the family dog.  I laughed and cried and huffed and thoroughly enjoyed reading this
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been playing minecraft on my Xbox for a while now. But now I can play anywhere I go!
B00999DFP0|2.0|I bought this set as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves the series. When we opened the cases to check all the disks, we noticed multiple scratches on nearly all of them. We attributed it to the shipping process since all of the cases were sealed, however, two of the disks we've watched so far won't play due to the scratches.  I thought I was getting a deal on amazon, but I'd rather have gone to best buy and bought them if it meant no scratches. Great series, just recieved it in poor condition. I bought this item new, by the way. Not used
B000SEKNUK|5.0|Highly recommend the Audible version as it is narrated by both authors (who have delightful voices) and backed with great music as their examples. The ideas profoundly changed my concept of what is possible.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is very engaging as it takes you through the various levels and continues to provide more challenging games.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Our family watched this movie together and we loved it!  My husband and I our 23, 20 and 17 year old all thought it was great!  We watched from beginning to end without a break and everyone sat and watched!
B000TETKA8|5.0|Acid harmonies, strained vocals, leaden rythyms: art punk crowned by \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" and punctuated by other gems:  \\"It's No Game\\" and \\"Up  the Hill Backwards\\"
B00A6HHJ9C|3.0|Steve is the Greatest. I own most everything he has ever done. Too few tracks. Too negative in mood, message and tone. Should have been more &#34;balanced&#34; and complete.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|The picture starts out great but the lost my interest. I can not put my finger on the reason why. I may have to watch it a second time
B005LAII3A|3.0|I enjoyed this film, but found myself longing for the original.  Too many changes to the story....<br />The special effects, action, CGI, & acting is phenomenal.....but the story just didn't hook me the way the original's did.
1609611543|5.0|FOUND THE BOOK SO INTERESTING AND INFORMATIVE. SINCE I HIGHLIGHTED CERTAIN AREAS OF THE BOOK AND THEREFORE WANTED TO KEEP IT FOR REFERENCE AND NOT SHARE IT, I PURCHASED ANOTHER COPY SO I CAN LEND OUT TO THOSE WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED.
B009YQJ322|4.0|Just think the opposite of Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd from years ago and you'll understand....<br />The Helmet does not come off!<br />Dredd at his finest!!
B001Q5397O|2.0|This is almost a satiric movie.  It reminds me of the scary movie series!  But it is no where near as funny!
B009MO57H6|3.0|Yes!  It will never end...or so I think as I watched the ending to this film starring Mila Jovavich for the 5th time in the franchise.  Violence, great special effects, a decent story, Paul W.S. Anderson's blatant cliffhanger endings that beg for another film, and the lovely and talented Ms. Jovavich add up to another hit movie.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This show is so awesome! The idea of parallel universes remind me of Robert Heinlein. The cast is Great! Each episode is better than the last. I am looking forward to a spin off of maybe just Walter or a future scenario.

B0092MKFIY|5.0|This band is fantastic.  The songs are powerful and vocals are great.  They are a lot of fun to listen to and would highly recommend.
B00B10HAO2|5.0|Awesome movie that should have been nominated for an academy award except that the Hollywood commies needed to push their anti American agenda.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is everything I thought it would be, and more. No part was ever boring!! Had trouble putting the book down!!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|the only thing that would make the series better would be to have Amazon Prime include the 5th season in it's selection.  I was most annoyed to finish season 4 only to find season 5 not available on prime.  Netflix is soon to add Fringe to the mix... we shall see if that pulls people in their direction.<br />It was sad to see Fringe end, although they did come to a logical and satisfying conclusion (no spoilers here).  It is rare to find quality science fiction on television.  The Sci-Fi channel (now called SyFy) is a bore... I suspect they will soon change their name because they no longer offer Science Fiction fare.  With all the quality science fiction novels and stories out there, it is perplexing that this is so little of it reflected in video or movies.<br /><br />If you watch Fringe, you must begin with the first season to truly appreciate the development of the characters as well as the storyline.<br /><br />ENjoy.... we did.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Very entertaining..my grandsons loved it.  They couldn't keep their eyes off of the tv.<br />Recommend this to anyone that is babysitting kids.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I love this movie. Since it's older (1984) it feels like the animated American 80's and 90's movies I loved as a kid. But so do my 8 and 10 year old half-brother and sister. Just as much as they like movies like Brave or How to Train Your Dragon (Also great movies). It has a great message and a strong female protagonist. Can't go wrong with Nausicca!
B001224WBS|5.0|My only disappointment is that they left out &#34;Policy of Truth&#34;. Otherwise a fine collection of their older classics and more recent hits.
034580404X|5.0|I love these books so much, read all three in less that 2 months. I couldnt put them down and the box that they came in was great to make sure i don't miss place any of them.
B003VPWX6K|4.0|An intriguing look at life during that period and one man's review of his life choices.  I was looking for something different than what I normally read and was pleasantly rewarded.
B00683JK9K|1.0|Cannot rotate piece no matter which method is used. Tried over and over. Glad this was a free app when I got it. Hoping for an update before uninstalling. Looks like it could be a cool app if it worked properly.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Not the best Bruce Willis action movie.  Had a good concept but fails to connect the viewer with the movie.
B0063GORYU|3.0|It is okay, nothing special. Not very complicated. The game is actually too big for a Kindle. Fun to play.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game is great! Can get hard but can be very editing I would recommended this app to others because it keeps my brain working so I can get to be a better problem solver. I kind of like the sandbox level but I think we need unlimited pieces instead of trying to get them. If you are trying to decide to get this or not you should because it is a great game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The reversal of roles in headline news stories was forced and contrived. There are no indications of psychopathology until it jumps into the story, fullblown, but not very believable.
B0083KCFF2|4.0|This is a cute story, it invokes questions from my three year old daughter every time we read it. I also like the cardboard pages. My one year old is famous for ripping pages.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have stayed away from Stephen King for a number of years now but my mom told me that this was a great book. She was right, I couldn't put it down and finished in just a couple of days. Great mystery and intrigue and insight into what could have been....great book!
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I cannot believe this movie won Best Picture. Yes the story is compelling as it is rooted in truth however the acting is completely flat. I dont think Ben changes his facial expression the entire movie. Plus at no point do we really care about any of the characters. Sure, Ben throws in a estranged relationship with his wife and 10yo son that is more like a foot note then anything else. We barely meet the hostages and when they had the chance to show any real emotional scenes they end up being short and contrite. I gave it 2 stars because, for the educational and documentary value, its an interesting story, which no one that is involved in this movie had any hand in writing. Its just a telling of 'what happened'.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a wonderful read, well researched, interesting. I have a much better understanding of Lincoln and the reasons for his greatness. He really was a great man because he was so honest, compassionate, and truly interested in others. Wish we had more politicians like him!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Much better than the movie<br />Can't wait to read the next one. I would definitely recommend it to any one
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This was a very readable story and readers can probably relate to some of the characters. It will promote healthy discussion on the euthanasia debate.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|A friend told me this had dropped to 1.99.  I instantaneously downloaded.<br /><br />Best album since Kid Cudi's &#34;Man on the Moon.&#34;
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|This was good biography about Alfred Hitchcock and his wife. This movie was good but I was hoping it would be more about the making of pyscho but it was more about the relationship between him and his wife.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I play it over and over again...........My daughter thinks I am crazy !! It is one of the best cd's I have bought in a long time. I just love them !!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great story telling and directing! The screen writer, cast, crew, director and all involved should be very proud of their film.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Story continues on with unexpected twists that keep me literally glued to the story. More than ready for the 3rd installment of this series to hear Gideon's story.
B00A6TYCNQ|4.0|I thoroughly  enjoyed playing this game, it has a decent storyline and amazing graphics for this platform. The cut scenes were put together very smoothly as well. if there was anything to complain about id say multiplayer and also a limited. number of levels.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Ok maybe not the best show ever, but I definitely feel like this show is pretty high up there on my list. I have watched almost the whole season over the course of about 3 days. I will likely finish it up tonight. Hilarious show, and it is just getting better each season.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show!! The first episode of season 1 is boooooorrrrrring but get through that and you will love it.
B003U53GK8|5.0|it is the best season every I liked it so much I will watch it again. It was so good
B004GJDQT8|2.0|Went to get this app and it will not load on my tablet so I can't use it. Is there not one for tablets?
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I would recommend this to any adventure loving person. Its a fantastic fantastic read, truly. Just amazing, that was. Great. Read
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love this series. I am a Downton fan, but I think I may like this even better.<br />Beautiful scenery, engaging characters, it has it all.
B001CDLATE|5.0|This movie touches and awakens with such depth it changes you to the soul. Makes you rethink life almost from a divine viewpoint. Makes you wonder how God feels as you watch it together.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|It's sad but not depressing. My only complaint is that Emma Watson's accent was a bit off, but she was clearly perfect for the part. It is a really great movie!
B009Z5975A|4.0|I must confess that I had not seen The Goonies and I saw it for the first time  with this purchase. The Goonies never played in the theaters in my country or aired on TV and I had not come across it on any TV channels in North America. I had heard many things about it.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a fantastic item containing all three movies which are considered to be the essential 80s entertainment. The Goonies didn't have the same effect on me as it did on many fans. Seeing it as a grownup is not the same thing as seeing as a teenager; I am sure if I had seen it as a kid, it would have had a much more different impact on me. It would be like reminiscing the childhood memory. Unfortunately, I didn't get that feeling. To me, it was an OK movie. I was never a fan of the Chinese kid (who didn't do much for me in Indiana Jones 2nd movie) ; I also didn't like the cliche jokes about the fat kid (he is always stuffing food in the beginning of the movie), and I also didn't like the way they played the deformed character Sloth; I found that creepy and sad but not funny or amusing in any way. Other than that, there are some really funny lines, memorable scenes which make this movie fun to watch (it was also amusing to see Josh Brolin so young). Watching this with commentary from the director and cast (25th anniversary commentary) was actually more fun for me than watching the movie itself. There were a lot of nice jokes and funny commentaries regarding the making of the movie.<br /><br />Gremlins is as great as I remembered it, and maybe even better than I remembered it. It is very well-made, great special features, suspense and funny moments are nicely complementing each other and the original score is awesome. I can watch this again and again.<br /><br />Gremlins 2: Not as great as the Gremlins. This one is more cartoonish than the first movie. But it still has a very nice pace and some new additions to the concept (for instance, the genetic lab in the building allows some newly mutated Gremlins to be produced). I wasn't amused by the seductive female Gremlin creature or by the fact that some Gremlins monsters were talking as if they were human beings.<br /><br />All three movies come with feature commentaries and making-of featurettes which is a bonus. I recommend this Triple-Feature to all the fans of the 80s.ws some newly mutated Gremlins to be produced).

B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|I highly recommend this movie, especially if you're a wondrous spirit like myself. The triumphant story was well narrated and beautifully directed.
B00BKVKAC6|1.0|This is one of the worst shows to grace the ranks of television.  I watched a few episodes of season one. It was a complete and utter comedy.  The actors are so incredibly terrible that they literally made me laugh.  Not in my entire life have I/will I ever see worse acting and a more poorly written show.  Watch American Horror Story: Asylum instead.  Now there's a show that you won't regret watching.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The setting, the acting, the writing, the ensemble - it is all outstanding.  I am so grateful to my friend to urged me to see the series!  Highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in quality television.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Good book fun to read.  Historical fiction.  The characters are interesting and have some depth.  I would recommend this book.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Points congruency with the mind stretching novel combine with a stunningly realistic rendering of this improbable situation.  I was only disappointed by the pandering logical character mapping in the at the conclusion of the climax.  This destroyed sone of the power and majesty of imagination so carefully cultivated through the novel.  Great purchase experience on Amazon, smooth playback on Wii.
B00011KHTM|5.0|Exactly what I needed, just make sure you get the right one. Look on the apple site and it will let you know exactly what you need.
034580404X|5.0|I Love this book. I can't wait for the  movie. Every woman needs a man like Chistian<br />Grey in their life.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Good for the entire family.  Kept us entertained throughout.  If you or your family like the books, the movies (both of them) are fun
B0033H7VI6|5.0|THIS IS A NICE BUG OUT KNIFE.  FIT AND FINISH ARE NOT THE BEST.  THE GRIND IS A LITTLE OFF,  BUT ALL IN ALL A NICE KNIFE.  HEAVY BODIED WITH A GOOD GRIP.  THIS KNIFE WENT RIGHT INTO MY BACKPACK IN THE TRUCK.  I'LL TRY IT OUT ON MY NEXT FISHING TRIP.  I'M A COLD STEEL FAN AND HAVE A CARBON 5 TRAIL MASTER FOR MY EVERYDAY SHEATH KNIFE.  SHOULD BE A GOOD CAMP BLADE FOR DETAIL WORK.  GREAT PRICE TOO.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|great book my wife got for the kindle on her iPhone i started reading on my kindle i cant put it down
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Average movie with above average acting. Straight and to the point, which was action action action. Nothing like the original. Overall, better than the original.
B008476HBM|4.0|I loved this classic! A little long but well worth it. Something I will read again and again. Wonderful book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book just like the others, all of the twist and turns that kept me guessing and wanting more. The only problem is that I still want more! This ending is kind of what I expected but surprised me in the best way all the same. If she has any other book, I'll definitely be reading them! Thank you Suzanne Collins.
B009K72G8I|4.0|But more than half of this season was meh. A whole arc about droids? It was like 4 or 5 episodes that just sucked. Then the thing with the younglings? If it hadn't been for Hondo that would've been a total waste too. I'd like to see season six take a more serious tone. Something in line with the Maul arch from this season - which was AMAZING!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this app...passes time fast while waiting at drs, appts, or anywhere. Don't need to purchase anything in app either :)
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Your child will definitely spend hours and hours mastering this, although they may break it (by dropping it, or having it roll off something) before defeating it completely.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|LOVE THIS CD- I USE IT TO WORK OUT AND IT KEEPS ME GOING. EVERY SONG IS GREAT AND HAS A BEAT TO DANCE TO.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is quite entertaining. The graphics are outstanding. Overall fun game to play. :) I strongly reccomend this game.
B008BRC6NS|5.0|LOVE THIS CD/DVD COMBINATION. IF YOU LIKE JENNIFER LOPEZ THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD. I LOVE THE DVD WITH ALL THE MUSIC VIDEOS ON IT TOO.
B000024IFB|5.0|My girlfriend loves it. Her only complaint was that CD 2 was not as good as CD 1. Also, she thought it included a DVD, which it does NOT.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was a very good book once I started I couldn't stop!  I would definitely recommend but it is a quick read
B00005T7I1|5.0|This is one of the best adaptations of a comic book I've ever seen. They do such a good job of scene painting and characters, etc. The music, the ambiance, everything is very era-appropriate.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It made me cry and believe in love again. A must read. I would recommend this book to anyone. Please buy it!
B00821OX98|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the show it was well done some of the effects maybe not quite the best but the show kept me intrigued and I'm looking forward to another season
B009KS4XRO|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT GAME ONLINE AND THE APP IS TERRIFIC TOO!!! THANKS TO THE NEW CHANGE!! LOVE IT!! THANKS
B007IV11PM|5.0|This was when I went from just enjoying Doctor Who to absolutely loving Doctor Who. You get a hint of it in Season 4 with the episode titled &#34;Blink&#34; and the first episode of Season 5 is pure gold.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was an amazing book the best one I have ever read.  This was the only book that made me cry.  This book is a funny, silly, and a sad book.  This book made me feel so good and so sad for him.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Not only is the perspective from an child from India as a minority in USA but she also finds out that she is an orphan.  So it really is a good read about her struggle, her parents stuggle and even her biological parents struggle and why they made the decisions they did.  Thoroughly enjoyable.
B009ME47H2|5.0|I let my 10 year old daughter use this app for a black history bowl, so she read the questions in the Mic and it records up to 92 hours enough time. She could also listen to the questions and play a game at the same time! At least when the game was on mute. Still great app. Recommend to people who do speeches and stuff.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Got this app for my son's Kindle Fire.  This graphics are great and the game is challenging for him.  I would recommend this app.
B003WQT2YY|5.0|This film is really quite famous in its way. It does take liberties with history to make a more engaging story but has fine acting and incredible music. They treat Mozart like a rock star and he behaves as badly in an innocent way. The music is mostly done by a great orchestra and choral group and makes you interested in the music even if it is normally not your thing. I would have wished for an ending less sad but life always comes to an end and genius's musical or otherwise often have a story of woe in their life.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is surprisingly realistic! Its better than many other &quot;virtual pet&quot; games on other consoles as well. I highly recommend it!
B008220DIC|5.0|P.T. Anderson is on a winning streak with his films, each one being fantastic. The Master is no exception. Powerful performances, Immaculate production design, and a strong script drive this film to greatness. It may not be everyone's cup of tea due to it's ambiguity. But as a character study of a severely broken man, it is a masterpiece.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|love it! Good songs and it was a christmas present for my grandma and she was so happy!! Good cd!
B005LAIII0|5.0|Bravo to director Ang Lee for his Oscar win for his brilliant work on this film. Richard Parker, the tiger, is a marvel of modern CG, and the rest of the film is beautifully shot. This is an emotionally powerful film you experience rather than just watch. The lead actor does a terrific job.
B002PJL85K|2.0|I found the story complicated and confusing. The Merlin character was completely bizarre. I kept watching to see if it would get better and it never did.
B003Y6EL5W|1.0|Turned it off after 30 minutes - 30 minutes of my life I'm never getting back.  I usually like Nicholas Cage - this one is just dumb and a waste of celluloid.
B007TG34QU|4.0|This is a very nice set of concerti. I bought it on the strength of Podger's previous venture into [[ASIN:B00008LKDY La Stravaganza.]] The difference here lies in the backing orchestra. Arte dei Suonatori plays with pizazz and vigor, and Podger feeds on that. Holland Baroque is very nice. They play very nicely. In their hands Vivaldi becomes a very nice, bourgeois Dutchman. There are many limpid passages, but quite often I thought I would like to hear a bit more gusto.<br /><br />One pairing I would like to hear is Rachel Podger with Il Giardino Armonico. They are never dull, and have a knack of backing up \\"decent\\" artists, like [[ASIN:B00002CF52 Cecilia Bartoli]], or [[ASIN:B0009IFF08 this one]]. Granted Giardino's \\"largo\\" may tend more toward Allegro molto at times, but they really get Vivaldi, whereas Holland Baroque is merely very nice.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|This game is pretty good.  It has a storyline and the levels aren't so difficult that you lose interest in it.
B001XV09UG|3.0|Lots of skin, slow. I can't comolain about the acting but all scenes were drawn out and the plot did not make sense.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I loved it the book is hard to get into but once you do you cant stop reading. It is a action fulled story about a boy named Thomas and the challenges we. Face in the future. I recommend this book with anyone you loves a mysterious twisty plot. This book is one of the best books i have ever read. Please read it
8866131105|5.0|Wonderfully classic and chic moleskin, nothing can compare. If you like these hard black solid agendas/planners, you won't go wrong here.
B009O2XY12|5.0|The is a fun, addicting game.  I love arcade games like this and would consider purchasing more/  I liked it!
B00946WMXY|4.0|This may be a B+ film, just like those B horror movies, but this would be recommended for the Bond collection
B00BKVK0MG|1.0|Why on earth did I pay $2 for this video? If I wanted to sit around for an hour watching two groups of people talk about what to do, I would've invited my parents and in- laws over and asked them to choose where we would go out to dinner. That is literally all this episode was- both camps sitting around chatting about what to do next. I kept waiting for it to get interesting, and it never happened. I understand that to some degree strategizing is important, but couldn't we have covered that in five minutes or so? Did we need to ignore the fact that this is at heart a dirty, mayhem laden zombie show? There were basically two zombies killed in the whole episodes, no major characters were injured or really even inconvenienced. Where is the murder and mayhem and chaos that we are used to? That is what we really watch this show for. If I wanted boring thought and subtle plotting discussions, I would chop of my man parts and watch Desperate Housewives with my wife. I would sooner pay $2 to get a foot massage from a porcupine than pay for this episode again. Love this show but in the three seasons this episode is by far not up to par.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|LOVE Downton Abbey! I can't wait for season 4! Each season gets better and better. A must see! EXCELLENT series.. The acting, wardrobe, set, and direction is award worthy!
B007QDNKQA|2.0|Just not a movie for me.  Felt a lack of depth in movie.  For fans of Mark Wahlberg, you will like it.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|What can I say?  Classic!!! Still great after all of these years! It should be on everyone's Kindle or on their bookshelf!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE. IT IS THE MOST TOUCHING BOOK EVER!!! I wish it never ended, the story is so sad, and  I am still crying form it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You'll have no more free time playing other apps. This game is extremely addictive. Many thumbs up for this one!
0316228532|2.0|I carefully avoided knowing anything about this book before reading it.  I wanted to be completely surprised - and I was.  JK Rowling has a wonderful way of painting vivid pictures with her words, but after completing the book I am left with a number of disturbing pictures in my mind that I would truly rather forget (I think we know what most teenage boys are up to without reading crude, detailed descriptions of what they look at online, images that refuse to leave the mind later).  The book would have been just as effective without the most graphic descriptions.  I am not a people watcher or celebrity stalker - therefore I found the plot (following the lives of several dysfunctional families) rather disinteresting as a topic.  Only a great like Rowling could have made it even as moderately interesting as it was to me, but I can think of many other books I would have rather spent my time reading.  Overall, I was disappointed.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|This movie has some many things going for it.  Keira Kightly is excellent as Anna and the rest of the cast is great as well.  They tell a great story and the production is excellent.<br /><br />The problem is the direction.  It is made in what I can only describe as a \\"pseudo theater\\" movie.  Half the scenes are shot as if they are in a playhouse.  The characters change clothes as if moving between scenes and pictures are used as backdrops.  The effect is really distracting from the story. And it isn't even consistent.  Most scenes at the end of movie drop this affectation and play like a normal movie.  I started to be more engaged by the plot and not as distracted or confused by the theater backdrops.  I only wish the whole film was that way.  For all this I was engaged enough to watch the whole movie.  So it kept my attention.<br /><br />I'm actually a fan of the director (Wright) but he made a misstep here.  Perhaps he has made too many period pieces and wanted to try something different but different isn't necessarily better.  Next time if he wants to direct a play he should do that.<br /><br />Not a bad film, but less than it could have been, and that is why I gave it 3 stars.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy playing this game very much, but it's not terribly challenging. That being said, I would recommend it and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is that lack of challenge.
B0086213XW|4.0|this romantic comedy provided a well thought out solution to the romantic comedy.  It is not the usual cotton-candy view of love and relationships.
B00000J048|4.0|Ordered this for my 2 and 3 year olds; package says 3+, but when they boys opened this Christmas morning they couldn't get enough of it.  The plastic is sturdy (even the little white connector pieces) and I haven't had any problems with stickers coming off.  Only gave it four stars because although it says 55 pieces, they are counting every piece, not just gears, which I think is a little unnecessary.  You basically get exactly what's pictured on the box.  That being said, I don't think the product would necessarily be better if there were more, this seems to be enough for introducing little ones to gears and connecting pieces and is enough to make a rectangle box full of gears or a long &#34;snake&#34; of gears.  I think you can get more if your little one seems to have a real interest in exploring the world of gears.  The pieces are also not too small for a little baby to be around, as long as nothing has been broken.  It took me a few days to decide between this set and another one, I am happy I chose this one.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Being a lover of  post apocolyptic  &#34; SHTF&#34; literature I'd heard nothing but glowing praise for WWZ. Then when I heard the movie based on WWZ was soon to be released I finally read the book ( having sat on my Kindle for 18 months )<br /><br />I was not disapointed , it lived up to the hype and then some. I loved it .<br /><br />Easy 5 stars , ripping read
B007REV4YI|5.0|I like the new James Bond actor even better than the origional.  Great Action Movie and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Thanks Amazon for the great deal as well, you even beat Wal...... if you know what I mean.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I love an application that can actually do the main thing that it advertises that can do.  And TubeMate is such a product.  Great for grabbing a clip that you won't be able to stream when you want to watch it.  I've only had it for a bit, but kudos so far!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy playing game while i do laundry. I recommend ed the game to my neighbor. Her son is into it now.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|The movie was fantastic . . . and the CD soundtrack is also wonderful!. I would surely recommend this to anyone.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I was very pleased with the product. The DVD was very good and everything I expected. I would recommend it to anyone.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend and he ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!! It does not disappoint at all!.. It comes wrapped in plastic wrap and it is well packaged... Arrived just in time so I could give it to him as his Christmas present!.. I STRONGLY recommend buying it!
B005NNUKF4|5.0|Great quality sound from a great quality band. Every song is remastered well and the tracks are blended appropriately. Meow.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun game! It was frustrating at first until I figured out that you need to click and slide on the actual guy.  Now I am addicted.
B003LQ3YXU|2.0|I lived in the UK when the first series was produced, yes that long ago!<br /><br />At that time it had very little to recommend it. The special effects were non existent and the props were laughably crude. Today, the special effects and props are sophisticated, but now the acting is laughably crude.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it.  Great escape from a hectic day. Everyone should have a fifty in their life!!  Hope there is a 4th on he way!!
B009EAALEW|3.0|Cheesy production values.  It did not capture the great feeling of a live performance.  Too many shots of the audience.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is an awesome show, and although a little gruesome at times, the story lines are engaging and entertaining!!  I would recommend it to anyone who can watch an R-rated show.
B00A7ZWUJC|1.0|I like her voice. I used to like her music, but every since Chris beat her up.....she is trying WAY TOO HARD to be hood. She isn't gangster. Why try to represent something you are NOT? If she does what she does (R&B/POP), it's great! However, she has strayed too far away from herself and I doubt she will ever come back. She could've been a great role model....Could've been. This album is garbage. She is constantly repeating herself, constantly swearing, constantly talking about sex. It falls WAY FLAT of any talent! There are 2, maybe 3 decent songs. I was so upset that Eminem was featured on the worst song of the whole album.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|My step-dad loved it :) . ......Have nothing else to say. . . . . . . . . . .
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I purchased this book for my 11yr old daughter. She loved the Percy Jackson series and needed something to read. She loved this series and burned through it within a couple of months! I hope he will start a new series!!
B00003CXI1|5.0|the shipment came in expected time and was in great shape when it got here there was no scratches on the used dvd and is in great shape thank you.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I found myself lost in a world I had never imagined. The bantering between Ana and Christian was delicious. I simply could not put the book down!
B000W796OM|5.0|the shipment came when it was expected in great shape and the disc was practically brand new other than the disc had someones name written on it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Interesting book and an easy read.  Wish there was more detail of some missions. Would have liked to know the feelings behind the shots.  Chris was a true blue American hero who did the job that had to be done and he did it to perfection. Rest in peace Chris.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was better written than the first - kept me wondering what was going to happen next and how it was going to turn out.  The ending left me wanting more and I was glad that I could go right in to the third book.
0385040253|5.0|Received new within 7 days.<br />All info as listed. Used before in the '60s.<br />Very useful for a multitude of purposes.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  It was a light read and very entertaining.  I enjoy comedy and hers particularly.  loved it
0307474259|5.0|The most informative book, written in an easy way to understand, on &#34;dieting&#34; I have ever read.  I'm totally convinced and<br />have already lost 6kg in 6 weeks. Thank you so much!
B00B0NF4L6|3.0|I had this recommended to me because I liked Wavves and Pissed Jeans, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Bottom line: maybe I'm just too old for their target audience, but I couldn't find anything in this album to latch onto. Rather than hearing something new by a new band, I got retreads of punk and grunge and more songs about getting drunk and stoned. It felt more like a checklist of influences than an album. &#34;Here we're trying to be like Wavves. Here we're trying to be like a generic grunge band kind of crossed with the Sex Pistols. Here we just wanted to write a song about booze and weed.&#34; If you want music that sounds like all that without trying to do anything fresh to set itself apart from a dozen influences and a hundred other Socal garage rock and punk bands, then by all means give this album a try. Otherwise just put on Nirvana or Soundgarden or Wavves.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Somehow or other I missed this series.  It's cynical-behind the scene look at politics-plays well to my current sensibilities.  Ian Richardson is brilliant, and I cannot imagine anyone else carrying off his role.  I'm sure I'm not saying anything that hasn't been repeated.  Where was I when this was run on PBS?
0765309408|5.0|Forget any comparison to Heinleins' Starship Troopers.  This first novel is Freshly imaginative with, I thought,a really stunning solution to the central question: How does a geezer (like me) bring anything useful to interstellar war.<br /><br />John Perry and his wife sign up on their sixty fifth birthday to enlist in the Colonial Unions army.  They actually do both join, but by different paths since Cathy Perry dies before their seventy fifth birthday enlistment day.  The whole process of joining, training and fighting is, again, imaginative and you must not miss the introductional harangue by Master Sargeant Ruiz.  Outstanding!<br /><br />Good science fiction is so hard to find among the fantasy flood, that each high caliber offering like Old Man's War is to be treasured.  I kept loaning my copies out and when I wanted to reread it for about the fifth time, I couldn't find on my bookshelf or, in fact, at local bookstores new or used.  Good books don't find their way into used book stores and, to my disappointment, My medium sized city has lost it's last genuine new book store.  So Amazon might be your best chance to score this satifying actual science fiction read.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great show, love the writing, acting, producing and directing. All the cast is awesome in their delivery. Very very poor quality to stream on amazon instant video. Very poor quality. I was disappointed. With the same internet streaming from Netflix I get almost HD type quality. Amazon is more expensive to stream per show, while netflix u can watch as many as you want.<br /><br />If you are paying more, you have to get the best qaulity.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins created another world that I actually believed.  I went there with Kat and Peeta everytime I opened this novel.  This book made me laugh out loud and I think I may have shed a tear or two.  Phenomenal story by a phenomenal author.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Has held up well and works great.  Why do they demand more words to do reviews?  Drives me nuts!  Redundant
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I read this book in a few sittings.  I normally go back and forth between novels, but this one I read all the way through.  It took a bit of time for me to remember who all of the characters were, since it has been so long since the last book was released, but yet again, I am waiting for the NEXT intsallment of Jason and Percy's adventures.<br /><br />The ending was pure genius. Cliffhangers annoy me, but now I can't want to see what is going to happen...

B005G5PPGS|5.0|Michael Lewis has a gift of bringing the complex story into focus.  If you love baseball and are willing to look at the game from a new perspective this story is one you can't put down.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I was confused having 2 different Upstairs, Downstairs at first.  This one is a little older in time making it completely different.  I love to watch most British programs, the American shows in my opinion cater to juveniles. There is a more intelligent  community here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie first. The book is MUCH better. Ready for the next one, and the one after that too.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I love the era to begin with.  I find it calming to watch and I am holding my breath until the next season is ready.
B0054SMID0|3.0|It didn't keep my attention. I watched it over three days a little at a time but finally finished it.Disappointing because of the actors it had in it thought it would be better.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I can only play it once and then either when I go home on my kindle, or it freezes up and it wont open again.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|What a waste of time it was. No storyline to me at all. Wished I'd passed this one up and just went to sleep.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Found this book to be a great read with not only romance but the perfect amount of suspense and twists!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was so happy to be able to see Season 2! I began recently with Season 3 live and/or on On Demand! Then I wanted to know the characters more, and what happened previously, so I watched Season 1 on Netflix. Netflix, however, didn't have Season 2, so I was so happy to be able to get it on Amazon! Could see it any time of day/night! Such a wonderful, addicting show!
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This book is another example of Lehane's ability to fully involve you with his main character.  I felt like I really knew this guy, with all his faults and strengths exposed.  I can usually predict a plot twist ahead of time but I never saw this one coming.  A great read.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Here's a good example of you get what you pay for!  It was free so I really have no room to criticize.  I unloaded the app in less than 24 hours after trying to use it several times.  I like the idea of having access to everything I can see on my pc, but it's very disfunctional.  There are MANY things I tried to do and it simply wouldn't cooperate.  This program would not show me continuous streams of entries, you get what is on your screen at the time you check into your account.  It would not let me perform other tasks that are easily done on my pc.  Like I said, you get what you pay for.  I guess if you live on Facebook so you see everything as soon as it's posted you would enjoy this product. This version would not open comments for me to see conversational strings, along with about 16 other things I tried to do. I have a droid, and it's not a dinosaur phone so I concluded it's this program that flawed, not my phone, which works well with every other app I've ever installed.
B006O2QNOU|1.0|I thought this movie had good intentions and tried to stand on its own with a strong acting roster but it collapsed because the screenplay was weak and without detail to give it real momentum and force. I would have done this movie very differently. Also, why get dressed up for a two o'clock emergency meeting? After about 25 minutes the movie lost me. Why does Jeremy Irons play that role again and again. He needs to play a different part. I would have cast him as the guy who gets laid off in the beginning. This movie had so many problems I cant believe my comment is this long.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have a droid.  This program frequently stops loading everything, and freezes a lot.  I have to unload and reload the program to get it going again.  I'm not satisfied, but I don't like the alternatives that are offered either.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As a long time lover of zombie films from Romero's \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" to Danny Boyle's \\"28 Days Later\\" the long awaited move from film to television series is complete and the name of the show is \\"The Walking Dead\\".  Outstanding, triumphant and oddly warming The Walking Dead delivers on all fronts. 5*****!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Pres. Carter, the CIA, Canada, and now I see where Iran had a wrestler from Nebraska, and all gave peace signs..
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is hard to stop watching.  It is Great to be able to watch an entire season at a time.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|I really liked the man with a vision both for work and drugs and alcohol.  The movie demonstrated what it is like to be a drug addict and alcoholic.  I like that the movies showed him serving time for his crime and his acceptance of his problem. Good movie all around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if you play it for 3 weeks they give u 65 diamond for takingcare of ur horse u should give it a shot plus if u want a pony u can show ur mom and dad and thry see ur can take good care of animal
B007VUCAVO|5.0|[[ASIN:B007VUCAVO Battery HD Pro]]I love this app what more can I say. If there was any other app I would choose for any tablets this would be it
B000MV9026|2.0|This was not worth the postage. The box was totally ruined. The disc itself was dirty and sticky. I tried cleaning it but whatever was stuck on it had been there for w long it had gotten hard (like glue). I didn't even dare put it into my player for fear it would damage it. I would have returned it, but the packaging went into the trash bin and I couldn't find it.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|All I can say is Wow!<br /><br />Watch it once, then watch it with director's commentary and learn how much realism went into the creation of this movie.  Then re-watch it and gain a true understanding that these guys aren't bothered about acting, or getting their parts right, their making sure their drills are performed as they would on mission.<br /><br />The one scene during a briefing where no script was used is phenomenal and comes off with military precision.  Fantastic movie and highlights the bravery of the Seals and other SF operators around the world.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is very challenging,and very  exciting you do not need anyone to play against,  its a great pass time, I recommend it highly,
B0026O475M|5.0|So much emphasis in today's world is placed on having the right gear, having the best technology and having the best skills available.<br /><br />All of those are useless unless the right mentalities are present.  In Cast Away this is ever so present and brings you the non-stop emotion-driven actions taken by Tom Hanks character in order to survive and deal with loss, isolation, frustration and depression, not to mention the physical stresses and injuries which are inflicted throughout the ordeal.<br /><br />From a survival point of view this movie is awesome!  Showing the importance of never giving up, having tenacity, audacity and clinging on to life values which drive us to keep going.  A difficult situation represented well, having me deep in thought about how to survive the situation presented.  A great survival movie!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|The story is above average but nothing too original.  I don't think it needed to take over two hours to tell the story, though.  Keep the remote handy because the dialogue will have you turning up the volume and you'll have to quickly turn it down every time you get to an action scene.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Simple, well made. Would like a little more variety with the levels but it's good for wasting time. Will definitely check out their other games.
B00A8307BG|5.0|Great Trower. very different renditions of the classics, all very good. suprises me with each listen. if you like songs a bit different than you've been acustomed to with each blues album, this is the one!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This was always my favorite book as a child and I am so happy to be passing it along to my children! My 2 year old LOVES this book:)
B0071LLHGC|5.0|Good stuff with a few atypical songs tossed in. great listen! glad i picked this one up. go ahead and buy this one
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I JUST LOVE THE SONS AND CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON SIX TO START!<br />ALSO WAITING TO PURCHASE SEASON FIVE.  I HAVE GOTTEN MY BROTHER<br />HOOKED ALSO...AND MY DAUGHTER AND GRANDSON -PRETTY MUCH MY WHOLE<br />FAMILY -WE JUST LOVE THE SHOW!  IT IS NICE TO HAVE THE DVD AND NOW I CAN<br />WATCH IT WHENEVER I WANT TO!  :)
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I didn't know much about this movie before I watched it. I was pleasantly surprised by just how much I loved it. It deserved the Oscar. Well done, Affleck and crew! Incredible story!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best book by far although I wish she would have continued with Christian's version. I hope she actually does come out with Christian's side of the story.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This very English soap opera will entertain you. The Abbey is worth seeing. All the actors do an outstanding  job. Like a box of good chocolates, it temptes you to enjoy another piece until they all are gone
B004XUMMFE|4.0|Too bad this series was cancelled after only one season. The character and plot development  were fun, intriguing, and not always formulaic.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It's another feel great book from Nicholas Sparks. I wasn't expecting the ending :) I rooted for both characters the entire time.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|Many of the issues of gridlock and change today exist because we lack a perpective as to where we are headed. Once visible, we can then gain a level of comfort with that direction. This book expands the aperture to a level that allows understanding and inspiration. Hopefully that will lead an embrace of positive change for the future despite the inevitable slipstream of chaos in its wake.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Rock documentaries can be duds, but this makes potentially dry subject very intriguing and interesting.  As someone who isn't a huge fan of Stevie Nicks or Rick Springfield, I was pleasantly surprised with their stories and their portion of this documentary.  Beyond the portions I figured I'd be bored with, I found the historical context and insight from today's best (real) recording artists to be outstanding.<br /><br />It seems like whatever Dave Grohl touches, it some how turns out great.  Sound City is no exception.  If you don't buy it, be sure to at least rent it once.
B000SW16NU|5.0|I'm no movie critic, however, for history's sake, Kingdom of Heaven is the best of the best.  However, in Ridley Scott style, the door was left open for the sequel. However, I will be long gone if I have to wait as long as Alien to Prometheus
B000N2HCM4|5.0|The young writer is able to communicate very clearly his unique life experiences and polished opinions. I predict great works from him to come.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I got hooked on this series when I found it on Netflix. I have watched the complete series three times I can remember - it's that good.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Where do I begin; I had gotten tired of making CD's and this was the perfect solution. You can place up to a 32gig SD card in the Soundfly with folders. If you have RDS, you can see artist and song title. The audio is similar to SAT and it's very good. I like the fact that you can adjust bass & treble on the unit. This was a great purchase and if you're tired of burning CD's??? This is the way to go....#satisfiedcustomer
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's great, watch it!  I was hesitant to watch, and I turned it off 10mins into the first episode.  Boy!  Was I wrong!  I LOVE this show.  Sure, now the season's over, and I have to wait til next season ARGH!
B00BESM14U|5.0|This book was my favorite when I was younger and the author being so involved in the direction of the screenplay really kept it what the story was. So good.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really like the huge variety of images and the different difficulty levels. I enjoy it, as well as my kids.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|It is fun and my little niece is good with it. I should buy her a piano. I enjoy mostly have for her.
B009K86D86|4.0|The movie was a great first look into how your food is grown and raised.  I haven't kept up my research with the issues presented; but I'd be surprised if the commercial food giants have since changed their ways much since 2008.<br /><br />My advice to you, either before or after you watch this documentary for yourself, is to know where your food comes from.  It doesn't mean you'll watch this film and stop eating Tyson or Purdue chicken - but you'll know.  Buy as local as you can.  This will help you accomplish that.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|If you want to pay to play then this is a fun game. Just like being at bingo but more fun. Get out your wallet and enjoy. NOT FOR ME&#62;  I did enjoy the chat to the side. Like most it is through Facebook.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|Before I owned this processor, I had an dual-core E8400 for mostly gaming but it began to bottleneck my system. That processor was an amazing one for its time but I quickly realized how slow it was compared to an i5 2500. I installed this puppy with no hassles and was quickly up and running. While not an i7, it's still very quick and it's all you'll need now for gaming or other processor heavy programs. Four cores is plenty for modern day programs, which was the reason I went with this quad-core instead of a six or eight core. Even when under heavy usage, this processor continues to remain at very low percent usage. Overall, this processor runs great and I've never had problems with it after owning it for a year now.  Intel's done an amazing job on this one, especially for the price point!<br /><br />Also note that if your not an overclocker, there's no need to go with the 2500K version. Save you money and go with the normal 2500.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Tis book was recommended to my daughter by her Honors English teacher. My daughter hasn't had the chance to read it yet, but i'm glad she mentioned the recommendation to me! I read this book in only a few days; it was hard to put down! I am recommending it to both of my daughters (Sophomore in high school and 6th grader) and also my husband. It moves quickly and keeps the reader in suspense wondering what will become of Thomas and the other Gladers. I'm looking forward to the next book!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Good series so far...though fiction, the history references provide food for thought about today's troubles.  An entertaining read.....very highly recommended.
B00821OX98|4.0|I have to say, &#34;apocalyptic fiction&#34; must be making a comeback. Wonder why? This is basically The Walking Dead for non-zombie fans. Interesting and well-done, for the most part. Has a severe lack of aliens for a show about aliens invading the earth, but the writers are aware of that and let you know it, so it's mostly okay. At least the aliens aren't the usual human actors acting as aliens acting like humans, which I hate. It's a good thing this alternate America didn't ban guns, because the humans would be effed, but you have to wonder where they got all the full-auto rifles. But,seeing as Spielberg is exec-producer, at least they have rifles and not walkie-talkies... Recomended if you like scifi... and can suspend your disbelief that a college history professor with no military experience can be a military expert with a distinct sense of American patriotism/appreciation.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is the heaven  its just like real mincraft this app needs more updates like water you could hold and place bye your hand and lava but still is the best.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|free play is nice but to advance you'll sink a lot of cash in this game. friends features are down so its very hard to advance and acquire ponies._(
B008VBYN80|5.0|I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME SINCE DECEMBER 22 2011. I LOVE THE GAME BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET ANY FRIENDS. SO IF YOU READ THIS AND LIKE THE GAME PLEASE ADD ME. bradley.mcintyre79@yahoo.com I'm also on Facebook. Thank you for taking the time to read this. :-)
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson does a great job of continuing Jordan's style. I am now purchasing other Brandon Sanderson books to read
B005721W9O|5.0|Love love love this movie. It is so campy and all the actors are some of my favorites. Grapthars Hammer!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|5 star for reality but not oscar worthy<br />Ben's acting was ok.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Watched it initially because I love Judy Dench and Maggie Smith. Wished it was longer. There were a few thready parts.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is so much fun. I got this for my kids, but now I am hooked! Would definitely recommend for a boy or girl.....or parent!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was very interesting and a lot of fun to play. I really liked the storyline. The graphics were pretty good too. I love hidden object games that have more interaction and an actual story rather than just searching for objects over and over again because it just gets boring. Very well done. I would definitely recommend this game to others and I most definitely will be purchasing more games from G5.
B00942YBQ4|5.0|This is such a great movie and worth the little extra for HD.  There is a big difference in visual quality.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|If I need to connect in a remote location I go to Google. I always get connected through this surch engine.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its cool.<br />I really like it its fun to play and cool likewise I would love to have my own horse but this ia close enough
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This has to be the best book l have read in a long time. Can,t wait for the next one.
B00821OX98|5.0|I really enjoyed this show. Perhaps even more than I thought I would. The characters feel fresh and well-developed throughout both seasons while maintaining some of the tropes of the genre that make sci-fi what it is when it is at its best. A lot of modern sci-fi falls into my &#34;guilty pleasure&#34; category, while I have no qualms about airing my appreciation for this one loudly and fervently. Great addition to the Amazon Instant lineup.
B008Y6TD5A|5.0|I had never seen this movie before but I like some of the work the lead actor has done so chose to look at it and once again i was not disappointed in his work i may purchase this one.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|this was a great, fun movie that even little kids will like! Loved Brad Pit in this too. about baseball
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Enjoyed it! Helps my eyes, mind, and hand coordination.  Excellent poduct. Will recommend to anyone to use it.<br /><br />Thank you.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This book is a great reference if you feel that you're off track. Pressfield keeps it principled. Will read more than once.
B000OCXI3K|2.0|For me, the movie told a better story; some pieces in the book were not resolved. I wouldn't recommend the book, but I'm glad I read the original source for the movie I enjoy so much.  Maybe it was the dramatic discrepancies between movie and book that disappointed me.
B00A6L78YE|4.0|if you like 60's rock with a psychedelic spin, this is an album/cd for you. funny lyrics & there's a song about San Francisco that may give Scott Mackenzie's classic a run for its money. there's really nothing new here but what's done is done well.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I thought this was a very well-made movie, and that Matthew McConaughey did an outstanding acting job in the lead role.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|my wife and I are expecting in march.  This movie was fun because if gave us something that we both could relate to it.  It really is funny.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Amazon Prime has paid for itself in &#34;Lost&#34;. Whenever I have time, I can access the next episode on IPad or computer or through PS3.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|ok, i think connery is the best bond but I also think that Daniel Craig is the next in line.  I just loved this movie.  Great action
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Amazon Prime has paid for itself in &#34;Lost&#34;. Whenever I have time, I can access the next episode on IPad or computer or through PS3.
B00AZ3KPZC|5.0|My wife and I are getting ready to have a baby boy.  When I saw this movie I just had to have it.  thanks amazon
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|This documentary is well worth seeing, even though it leaves us with as many questions as it answered.  Why didn't Rodriguez ever catch on in the US?  I'm sure that with the help of this documentary, he'll finally get his due; South Africa was just decades ahead.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|I am a huge mark wahlberg fan.  This, in my opinion, is one of his best movies.  I am so glad it is a prime movie.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Why the price for this is only 99 cents, I have no idea. This is a quality novel with amazing pacing, seriously scary attention to detail on the science, and an extremely likable central character. Sometimes the chatty, bubbly tone can seem weird -- \\"Yay!\\" -- but there are lots of little touches that just make the story flow.<br /><br />There's humor -- such as the protagonist having to make do with the entertainment choices of his absent mission companions. And there are plenty of difficulties and challenges, such as when he has to deal with shortages of water, power, and/or air. Yet nowhere did I lose that 'suspension of disbelief', which is often hard to maintain in hard SF novels.<br /><br />Anyway, I found it well worth the read and hope very much to see more from this talented author.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Great app!!  If you use Picasa (free photo app from Google), this is a &quot;must have&quot; app. I have been using Picasa for many years for sharing photos. Now this app makes it very easy to share on my Kindle. Runs very smooth on the Kindle. Have been using for 3  months with absolutely no problems. Recommend this app
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I like being able to down loss my music this is a great way to do so with out paying a penny.
B008Y7045C|5.0|Great story of redemption, love, and forgiveness.  See the softer side of Johnny Depp.  (And learn a little something about chocolate too!)
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|It was surprisingly good, but noticed a lot less emphasis on the whole Bond girl thing. It was more about Bond and his past than anything else.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though I knew how it ended, I was on the edge of my chair throughout the movie.  The historical news clips made it even more realistic. Ben Affleck was great;  I'd watch it again!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great story, well written and very entertaining.  Only goes over the top Hollywood style a few times.  Mostly believable and something I could see happening 30-50 years from now.  Not about aliens, this book is about an astronaut getting stranded on Mars and the resulting survival and rescue attempts.<br /><br />Why do ebooks have SO many more typos than paper books?
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Its nothing like the typical Bond movie. There's not much action, flashy cars, cool gadgets that you expect from a Bond movie. And Daniel Craig looks OLD!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I upgraded to this from an AMD 4170 setup and I absolutely love it! Don't get me wrong it was a great budget setup, but I love having the steady FPS that this setup provides. As a gamer, I couldn't be happier and would recommend this to anyone not on a tight budget that loves their games. Make sure to get a solid Z77 motherboard with it to be able to overclock the cpu. It's way easier than it seems, just do a little research beforehand and make sure you have a good aftermarket cooler.<br /><br />It has been solid in cpu intensive mmo's such as Guild Wars 2 and Planetside 2 and also in games such as World of Tanks and War Thunder.

B007V4530A|4.0|I'm among the thousands who dream of delivering a TED talk someday, so when someone recommended this eBook, I had to download it. I'm glad I did. The author brings together his gleanings from watching and analyzing dozens of TED talks, and distills them down into useful, actionable tips. A pass through by a good copy editor would have removed a few misspellings of proper names, but for content, this book gets a top vote from me--a quick read, highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|every moment of the show was a pleasure. Refreshing storyline and the characters were so well played. I watched Season 3 in non-stop mode . . . You won't be disappointed.
B0076UXKDG|3.0|USD 433 incl of Tax. Just a way too much but I am a pure Nikonian and would like to have anything on my Nikon bodies from Nikon. Everything else is Nikon quality but there are other companies that can make a kill on this price. I am sure Nikon don't sell much of these. This price cannot be justified and is absolutely not necessary since I paid quite a fair price for the D800. The units battery compartment comes with a tray for AA batteries and there is another for Nikon's battery and it will also give you a boost on the DX with the 6 FPS. Besides the cost there is no other flaw which I can complain about.
B007X70NVO|4.0|After having spent time in Italy near one of these raceways I became intrigued. This documentary provides solid insight for racing unlike much in the U.S..  Definitley worth the watch.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Just received yesterday.  Have not yet had an opportunity to view, but anticipate that it will be great.  After all, it won an Academy Award for best picture.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Adorable kid movie.  My children loved it and so did I.  Kept us laughing all night until the end of the movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this game better than others l've tried, works great .  It was free so I don't mine them ads
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|My husband made me watch this movie. I loved it! Although I do feel it was advertised wrong. it was a more emotional movie than one would guess by the previews.
8862933177|5.0|I purchased this for my son who is a film buff and communications/writing major. He loves it. In the last couple months he has attended a film festival and has also watched countless films on Hulu. He loves the guided cues for making entries and is really enjoying journalling about the many films he has watched.<br />I don't think this is something that your average film goer would put to good use but it's perfect for a real film connoisseur.
B0055B7IPE|3.0|I liked this movie. I just wasn't expecting it to start out in such a sad manner. It picks up and is enjoyable overall. Just couldn't get past how sad it was in the beginning.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is better graphics than before and I love it!!I hope you like it to!It's also for free that is the best part!!!
B005EGXNLS|5.0|This is a good continuation of the series that focuses on a key period of British history. I'd recommend reading the preceding books since it helps to understand some of the references.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Now, if you're NOT a Downton fan yet, don't start with Season 3 for sure.  Start at the beginning.  Season 1 Episode 1.  However...if you're like me...I didn't want to WATCH season 3 if I hadn't seen all of season 2, so....I finished watching season 2 and moved onto 3.  Wow are there surprises!  Many surprises and...while I can't say they're all GOOD surprises...you will not be disappointed.  Every episode leaves you wanting to watch the next.  I took two weekend nights and skipped regular TV to watch the whole season.  Can't wait for season 4.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|This was a fun movie for my wife and I and also for our 2 year old son who really enjoyed the musical parts of the movie. Good humor to keep us adults entertained as well.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 is a hard one.  So many ups and downs.  So many things that make you want to go back and watch over...just to be sure you didn't &#34;get that wrong&#34;.  If you've seen season 1 and you want to watch season 3...you MUST make time for season 2.  You must.
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|I have used my trusty HP 10bii for many, many years so when I was forced to buy the 12c calculator for my Corporate Finance class in grad school I couldn't understand how it could be any better than the one I know and love. Long story short.... it is (better). RPN mode takes some getting used too and having mastered the functions on the 10bii doesn't help the learning curve (which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5). Once you get used to it, however, it is really nice having some of the more common functions one button away (as opposed to having to shift to get to them) - same goes for the store and recall functions. The buttons are still very sturdy (not wobbly at all like cheaper calculators) which is make or break for me and you can set the contrast of the display (something I never felt the need to do, but nice to know it's possible).
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Being a creative person in many arts, I found Patchworkz to be SO satisfying for me.  This game helps me to also relax,  and practice my hand control.  I really cannot say enough about this game!  I Love it,  LOVE it!!
0316228532|2.0|Had to start a list of all of the characters, if I put down the book for a few days I couldn't keep track of who was who. Struggled through to page 100 then gave up.
B007RFBLDG|3.0|Early Will Ferrell. Preceeded &#34;Mean Girls&#34;, parodies of 2-3 other films. A smidge of truth always makes for the best humor. Not for everyone, but I did enjoy it.
B00AQB2A3I|1.0|Once upon a time I liked a lot the music made by Steven Wilson. It was exciting music with a lot of diferent projects at the same time.<br />Time passed and he kept doing the same time after time. He closed Porcupine Tree and started a solo path. The first disc (Insurgentes) sounded like the next Porcupine Tree record (where was the difference?). The second one, again, was the same, and this third one is... yes... the same old story. It looks like you were always listening the same song. The only difference you can appreciate is that sometimes is faster and sometimes slower. I miss a lot the times when a new No-Man or Porcupine Tree record was something to discover.<br />For newcomers can be a good thing but for people who knows Mr Wilson since the 90s this is only another stone in the same old way

B008MJC6ZS|5.0|If Testament had better management, they would have given Metallica a run for their money as the best hard core Metal band of all time.  This album kicks ass.  It's not &#34;too thrashy&#34; but probably the heaviest thing I've heard in a very long time.<br />TESTAMENT RULES!!!!!
0060557818|5.0|Neverwhere was the last book by Neil Gaiman that I hadn't read. I'm not sure why I hadn't read it; I just missed it somehow and, then, kept not getting around to it. But, finally, I did get around it. It has displaced, surprisingly, The Graveyard Book as my favorite Gaiman novel. I say surprisingly because, at first, I was a bit confused by it. Not the story. I was confused by Gaiman's sudden inadequacy with the comma. They were all over the place and in places they didn't (and shouldn't) need to be. What the heck? None of Gaiman's other books have comma issues; why would this one?<br /><br />Have you ever heard Neil Gaiman read one of his stories? Well, I have, and he has a particular cadence when he reads, when he's doing any public speaking (heck, for all I know, he always talks like that), and I realized by the time I had finished the prologue that the extra commas were there because Gaiman was, in fact, telling me how to breathe. Where to pause. When to go on. In effect, he was creating a particular atmosphere that was just as if I was sitting here letting him read it to me. And it was awesome.<br /><br />But, see, that's what you can do when you know what you're doing with the rules. It's knowing the rules and taking them and bending them to your purpose. Sure, probably more than half of the commas, actually, I'd bet more like 2/3 of the commas, don't belong. They're in places where they shouldn't be. But, then, you'd read too quickly and lose the atmosphere, the creepy, of the story. Gaiman wrote it to give you the effect of being underground, in tunnels, lost, confused. Of not knowing what's going on, whether your sane, or, even, if you are who you think you are.<br /><br />I loved it.<br /><br />And, now, I've flipped. I've gone from having his most recent novel as my favorite to having his first novel as my favorite. I don't think, either, that it's just because it's the one I've most recently read. I don't remember ever reading anything where the author paid so much attention to the atmosphere he was creating through his use of punctuation. Not that he necessarily did it on purpose, of that I have no idea, but he did do it.<br /><br />And we haven't even started talking about the story yet. Which is great. Disconcerting. Full of interesting characters. The marquis. Croup. Vandemar. Things are rarely what they seem. Even when they are. &#34;I've saved  his life four times today already.&#34; [Or something like that. I couldn't actually find the quote in what I felt was a reasonable amount of time.]<br /><br />Best of all, though, it doesn't end the way you expect these kinds of stories to end. The way they usually end. And I would talk about that, but I don't want to talk about the ending, so I'm not going to. All I can say is that you should go read it. I'm fairly sure I'll have to read it again one of these days, and I really don't do that rereading thing, so that's saying quite a bit.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book grabbed my interest from the first chapter and never let me go.  Wonderfully written and in a way that lets you know the characters and makes you relate with them. I was told that I reminded a person who read this of the main character wow I do...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 in keeping with 1 & 2, is a perfect example of fine acting on the part of the entire cast.  For me, it is quite rare to watch a continuing TV show as I have a busy life and I am never home the same nights from week to week.  However, I have made it a point to be available for Downton Abbey and look forward to Season 4.  What a great program.  The only thing better would be a much longer season.  Thank you PBS.  A. Leigh
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love Jigsaw Puzzles and this is a good one. It has lots of options including several choices including the number of pieces and a good selection of puzzles to choose from.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Gorgeous. I wish I'd seen it on the big screen, and maybe even in 3-D.  However, it was still an excellent movie!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|It's one of those movies where the adults will enjoy it just as much as the kids.  We watched it twice in one day :)
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|I don't think the season this year was able to evolve on it's own - in a brief (too brief, as I love the series) set of episodes, the writers needed to 'off' two departing actors.  I didn't know the actors hadn't renewed contracts, so I was shocked shocked shocked at their demise.  It will be interesting to see how the series recovers some sort of natural equilibrium.
1601252463|3.0|If you don't mind almost doubling the rules of Pathfinder from the core rulebook, go ahead and get this. Some fun classes, like the witch, some new everythings: feats, equipment, spells, prestige classes, magic items and general rules. My favorite general rule is the Hero Points.<br /><br />The downside is A: you've added a ton of new rules for a game already quite rules heavy, B: You've opened the floodgates to a zillion more splat books that will complicate your game until no one can understand it.<br /><br />If you don't mind complications, and want more options, great. If you just want to concentrate on story and think the core book is complex enough, you may want to pass.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I liked all of the characters, especially the Priest.  I was surprised at how vulnerable the caregivers allowed themselves to be, in letting go of some fear and care providing for Mark. (he seemed fragile) I don't know if the right people just came knocking on his door for the job, or it took weeding out many, but I loved the caring nature of the people that worked for him.  Helen Hunt's character was so delicate and sensitive.
1451620829|4.0|A must read for any KISS fan! I've been a fan since they were an opening act. Peter's book is hard to put down once you start reading it. You get the story from his perspective. Not Simmons and Stanley's for once!! And his perspective is very interesting. It reads like a runaway train. The pace is quick. Peter does not hold back in anyway. Talks openly about his drug use. Makes no excuses about that. A Rocker on the road doing whatever he wanted. And Man!!! Did he ever!!! You learn about a band that started from humble beginnings and worked as a team, to a band that was fragmented and at each other's throats. Just get this one and once you start you won't want to stop. I was never a huge Peter fan. But this made me look at him very differently and was eye-opening and exposing. I'm sure Gene and Paul were not too happy about some of the things that are revealed here. But my gut instinct tells me that this probably is the closest thing to the truth and what really went on.....
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|for all of you game lovers and are looking for an app to spoof up your day I would recomend this its very funny and cute. Itll put a smile on your face once you hear there cute noises.:)
B00AMBH70S|5.0|The Bourne Legacy, I have to admit, was good. I thought it was going to be another Jason Bourne flick but it surprised and entertained me.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Very cool and very weird.  Love Joshua Jackson.  The realtionship between father, son, and FBI agents has been fun to watch.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was sad to see Cybil go....she was really a good actress, and her husband Thomas was awesome as well. The series is one of the best PBS - Masterpiece has done!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Just keep reading......if it seems slow at times the outcome is worth it.  It reads like the dialogue would sound, so sections take getting used to them.  But that is partly why the writing is engaging.  And the overall theme of transformation, once you discover it, is powerful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It works really well on my kindle fire. Its easy to use and navigate. It really is like you are taking care of your own horse and get to train it. I love the game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of his best yet!  I have read a significant portion of Nicholas Sparks' books and this one is definitely in my top 3!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I bought this maybe one or two months ago and it came early which was awesome and when I got it everything worked and still works to this day.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What an incredibly beautiful and heartwarming story of such unbelievable courage and strength!<br />A definite read for young & old!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I own all seasons and this by far is one show I'm truly addicted to - definitely worth buying !
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|This was a fun action film. There is not much plot set up. I am guessing they assume you already know about the Judge Dredd story. There are some creative filming styles. I believe that it was filmed with the intent of watching it in 3D, because there are some scenes that seem unnecessarily long until you realize how awesome it would look in 3D. I would not recommend this for anyone who is sensitive towards violence.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I recommend to every one - such good deals on movies I buy all the ones I like for myself and my kids
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|This got 5 stars just because my friend worked on it, so I am biased. It pays homage to the original, but in a modern way and more realistic way (realistic in the sense that it is human vs. human, and no mutants or alien relics to save the day). No one will ever be able to replace Arnold as an action hero though. The film is slightly forgettable. If I had a choice of watching this one or the old one, I'd probably watch the original.

0525478817|4.0|As a new parent, this book broke my heart; I hate even thinking about the possibility of losing my child at such a young age and to such a devastating illness. As a woman in love, this book also made me cry. I can't imagine knowing that your days are numbered...not even because your life will end, but because you are about to lose the person you are so in love with and will have to carry on without him. The part about your memories feeling less substantial and shallower now that the person you shared them with is gone...I can't even imagine. I have so many wonderful memories with my husband, so many inside jokes...he has become such a presence in my life that those things would indeed feel emptier without him to share them with, even in reminiscence and retrospect. John Green really nailed these things, and he portrayed each character as perfectly, imperfectly human, which is important because it can be so tempting to make a suffering character into a hero just because he or she is suffering. I know I'm rambling, but this book touched me on many levels, and I made my way through it faster than I've read a book in a while, alternately smiling and crying. Definitely worth a read, I'd say.

B0029LCJJS|5.0|This is what TV can deliver that educates and entertains at the same time.  Acting in this series was excellent ... Now i have a mental picture of what Henry VIII might have looked like.  I want to see more of this type of series on Amazon Prime ...

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I bought this for myself after watching it several times on our movie channels. Great movie I highly suggest getting it or at least seeing it
B003O86FMW|5.0|A very good read, it keeps the reader interested and wanting to keep reading, even fighting sleep off late at night to get to the next chapter.<br /><br />I recommend is for young readers and parents alike. My 12 year old daughter is reading the same book and we really like it!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I can't say how many times we've watched this movie already. I've watched it myself several times without the kids. Everybody needs this movie!!!

B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love all Nelson DeMille books as he keep you  in suspense.  This book was a little gorey but a page turner as I wanted to see what was happening next.  Very suspenseful and all who like intriguing stories should enjoy this one.

B001ANYDAO|4.0|Great companion to &#34;Tipping Point&#34;. My daughter had to 'play-up' an age group, in club volleyball, because of her birthday. The first chapters explains why - laying statistics over my anecdotal evidence. After that example 'proved true', Gladwell provided several more.<br /><br />Now I look for outliers everywhere...
B005LAII12|5.0|One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time! Some parents shouldn't let their children see it but we raise ours to understand everything and don't shelter them and they loved this movie

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was as great as the others. It closes the whole story and I feel like it couldn't have ended better.
B0042RUMH8|5.0|Many haters and critics have slammed this album arguing that Jennifer's vocals are weak, or the lyrics are not that innovative, or the go-to arguement in Dance-pop music: It's not Lady Gaga.<br /><br />But this is truly Jennifer best album, it has everything pop, dance, R&B, balladry, and more but most importantly she sounds good. Her vocals are strong (not Adele strong) but good enough to infuse energy into the tracks (let's be honest Gaga and Rihanna has 'good' vocals and no one seems to complaint).<br /><br />On the Floor was the perfect comeback song and as the opening track, it sets the mood for the rest of Love? It is atmospheric dance/pop with a nice Latin undercurrent and house influences. 10/10<br /><br />Good Hit: the song with most auto-tune which almost makes JLo unrecognizable but it is catchy and sensual. 9/10<br /><br />I'm Into You: great summertime song, simply lyrics, great Latin danceable melody and a massive hook. 9.5/10<br /><br />(Whhat is) Love?: the tittle track encapsulating the essence of the album. The song is fantastic with a great na na na na hook impossible to resist and been-there, done-that lyrics. 10/10<br /><br />Run the World: Great love song with a great chorus and the melodies are simply beautiful. 9/10<br /><br />Papi: A monster song with a majestic hook and a fierce melody that's just fantastic to dance to. The lyrics are all about women embracing their sexy side and seducing their men. 10/10<br /><br />Until It Beats No More: The only ballad in the album where JLo reveals how a love pulled her out of a dark place. It proves how solid her vocals actually are. 9/10<br /><br />One Love: This song recounts some of JLo' most infamous affairs from P. Diddy to Marc Anthony. Its a rocking R&B tune with lots attitude and hope for one true love. 9/10<br /><br />Invading My Mind: The electropop shines in this track co-written by Lady Gaga. The song embraces the flashy club 'culture' and it's very good. 8.5/10<br /><br />Villain: Not my favorite song but the chorus is magic. 8/10<br /><br />Starting Over: Produced by Danja, a mid-tempo song with a galloping beat where Jlo decides to pull herself together after a heartbreak. 8.5/10<br /><br />Hypnotico: The perfect combination of American and Latin cultures in an explosive \\"girl power\\" summertime track. 9/10<br /><br />Everybody's Girl: Jlo wondering if her man can stand the pressure of dating a superstar! It is a good song though the leaked demo was slightly better. 8.5/10<br /><br />Charge Me Up: A fierce dancefloor filler with a delicious chorus and a banging 4/4 beat. 9/10<br /><br />Take Care: Hate it!!! 3/10
B007SPN5MA|5.0|Glen Harsard is my new favorite artist. He adds so much feeling to his music.  I love music by Van Morrison and David Gray as well.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Light weight, sounds good. Do not use for listening to music, but long periods listening to ham radio; where comfort and weight are important .
0307878937|5.0|this is a great book.  It is set in San Francisco, and the story is good and has lots of flower references.<br />loved it.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|Its a good movie to just kickback and watch a semi thriller/actiony movie. Nothing super special but great and suspenseful ending. I recommend watching it. Enjoy!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and can't wait for season 4!  Season 3 was another winner, very exciting and with lots of emotion!
B001N18HP0|5.0|You know you love Ten if you're reading this review.  What you probably don't know or have forgotten, is the whole vinyl experience.  If you grew up in the 80's, you know, but may have gotten rid of your turntable.  If you grew up in the 90's or later, you really missed out.  Well, guess what, vinyl is back.  Not just because it's retro-cool, but because it sounds good.  When we transitioned to CDs, we all thought they were so clear and sounded so much better...  Well, they were better than tapes, but put CDs up against albums and you'll hear more than just digital clarity, there's more soul or heart in the album.  It's closer to the musicians themselves (just lost the samplers and autotuners).  You play a record, not for the song, but for the album and for the experience.  Spend 30 minutes or an hour and listen.  No skipping ahead, no fumbling for the iPod to find a new track...  Oh, where was I, buy a turntable, buy this album and turn it up!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is so masterfully done.  My husband is even hooked, and he typically laughs at shows/movies like this but can't wait to watch this show with me!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is AMAZING, FANTASTIC, WONDERFUL, TERRIFIC!!  So glad amazon has it available to watch as I missed it when it started this season.  Highly recommend!
B007GE2H3G|5.0|The animation was great, and the story was always moving! This would be a great movie for families, kids, or the young at heart.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Actually, this one is way cooler than the other version. Love it. Just wish this game could be added to my Roku.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Good movie, rare when a movie, (let alone a Bond movie,) actually has a twist or 2 that I didn't see coming; fun watch all in all.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This app was fun to play and my niece loves it. I also like the options on the designs it gives you for the cards.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Fun and entertaining. I play a chapter a night and it goes a long way. If you like hidden object games and occasional puzzle you'll love this game. Give it a try.
B008XG1X18|4.0|My niece and I are always on this looking up the latest hair styles for long hair. Check out the french braid waterfalls.
B00192IV0O|3.0|Great CD, and it was a gift for another person.  I had some troubles getting a replacement for the case, since the packaging was in an envelope that didn't fair well in the mail service.  I asked for a replacement, but that one also was broken when arriving.  I made the best of things and used another CD case from one I had on another CD of mine, to be able to give it to the person I had planned on gifting it to on time.  I still love the CD, and so did they, just needs better packaging for the rough mail service.  Possibly bubble wrapped inside another bubble wrapped envelope, or a small box with bubble wrapping for protection.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is the BEST app to have on your Kindle Fire. The only problems is is that I can't keep it away from my parents.Really wish they would get their own so that I can play this game in peace. The best visual effects and sounds ever. Hard to put down when it's time to go to bed for work in the morning.

B000LBB4IA|5.0|Loved the movie. kids learned good lessons and started applying it already, especially my six year old son. Wish there were more movies like it.

B008JFUMT2|3.0|\\"A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD is a bad day at the theater,\\" sneered my snobby pal, and I felt like disowning him. But, okay, the law of diminishing returns does apply here. Twenty-five years since the release of the best Christmas movie of all time (and, yes, cretin, I mean DIE HARD), A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD ranks fifth in the series, in chronology and in excellence. I am a shameless DIE HARD apologist, but even I don't hesitate to say that this one disappoints on key levels. It is, essentially, a generic Bruce Willis action movie masquerading as a DIE HARD movie.<br /><br />It's been more than five years since the last one (LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, 2007). Them powers-that-be must've thought that the franchise still had legs, and, of course, they're not wrong. The classic first film had built up such good cachet that as long as Willis is willing to make more sequels, folks will flock to the theaters. But there's real jeopardy that the franchise is getting run to the ground. If it hasn't happened already.<br /><br />Indestructible everyman - and that oxymoron is a problem right there - John McClane hears word that his estranged son, Jake, is in trouble in Russia and he immediately books a flight. In Moscow, John McClane reunites with Jake (Jai Courtney) and learns that his son is an undercover CIA operative currently safeguarding a government whistleblower from a corrupt Russian official. Cue the explosions and car chases and the close shaves and the half-hearted banter, with Willis and Courtney striving for - and mostly failing to achieve - a measure of chemistry. With my mindset forever locked on this view that Bruce Willis is irreproachable, I put the blame on the writers.<br /><br />There's a bit of a renaissance of the old school Rated R action thriller, what with this picture and also Schwarzenegger's recent THE LAST STAND and Stallone's BULLET TO THE HEAD. Of the three, A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD exhibits the most impressive box office punch. Of course, there's this understanding that if this had been a non-DIE HARD Bruce Willis project, it's doubtful that it would've raked in as much profit. As a generic action film, it serves the nondiscriminating viewer. But if you'd been spoiled by how good the first DIE HARD was, then this is a dumbed down sequel, empty of nuances of character and devoid of the smarts and wicked humor that graced the original. The villains are so cardboard they should be propped up on the Santa Monica Pier for bystander photo ops. I pine for Hans Gruber.<br /><br />The most egregious offense is the treatment of John McClane who is now a pale imitation of his old self. Willis is a terrific actor. He's good enough that there are still traces of the humanity and the snark and the everyman appeal that won over critics and fans 25 years ago. Still, when he finally voices his trademark phrase, it doesn't feel like the film had earned it. There's enough popcorn fun in this one that I don't mind rating it 3 out of 5 stars. A present day sequel that is a shadow of its source material. But nostalgia is a powerful thing.<br /><br />As a continuity fiend I appreciate Mary Elizabeth Winstead's cameo as Lucy McClane.<br /><br />Also, I want whatever magical GPS device the McClanes used to navigate from Moscow to the Ukraine in the span of an evening.tanding that if this had been a non-DIE HARD Bruce Willis project, it's doubtful that it would've raked in as much profit.

B0066WJLU6|4.0|I like it because my kindle is usually by me and when I need a flashlight  it s there. I like it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|excellent great app everyone should get it its really fun and slaving love horses and since I cant heave a really one this wik
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Downloaded easily (with help from my daughter).  It's easy to use and navigate through the many selections.  Will make good use of it
B000ZM1FXO|2.0|Lets be perfectly frank. The only reason this movie had any traction back in the 70s is because of its sex scenes. This R version deletes all of those. You're left with a piss-poor production with characters that where at best, inaccurately portrayed. The only highlights where Helen MIrren and Malcolm McDowell's performance.
0395389496|5.0|Great keepsake and high quality.  Can't go wrong with this hard-cover book.  Will probably get another one when this one wears out.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I pick up this book because of the reviews, and I'm very happy I did.<br />It's a book full of hope, companionship, friendship, compassion and makes you feel that is not everything lost for the human race.<br />I will read the rest of Colleen Hoover's books
B005HEFB6M|5.0|While not as novel as its predecessors, it is entertaining.  The writers have done well to tie into the other series.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|The movie was really good. I would reccommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about dancing and the country. And if you dont you will still like it.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Those who aren't familiar with this prog rock mastermind best stick their nose in a book and read up on Steven Wilson. Best known as the brains behind prog rock heroes Porcupine Tree, Wilson delivers for our pleasure his third solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing (and Other Stories).<br /><br />Those who don't know better might confuse it for a book title, but those who do know the two mediums have their similarities. For Raven, Wilson has designed each song to tell a standalone story, much like chapters in a book, and each story focuses on some type of supernatural or occult element. There are tales of murder, death, regret, longing, and detailed character sketches to top it all off.<br /><br />And it's not just the lyrics that are supernatural; the skill involved in the musicianship is pretty otherworldly itself. One of the biggest upgrades between this album and his two previous solo albums is that he now has the most talented backing band behind him he's ever had. Famed English axeman Guthrie Govan handles guitar duties, and provides a level of skill and technicality rarely seen in any of Wilson's works. Adding to that confection is esteemed German drummer Marco Minneman, but Theo Travis's contributions are also integral. Travis plays a variety of instruments, including flutes, clarinets, and saxophones, which helps give Raven its signature sound.<br /><br />Wilson's compositions haven't been very technical compared to most progressive rock band, but as Wilson explained to Anil Prasad on Innerviews.org, this album marks the first time he's written instrumental material that is beyond his own skill level. The result couldn't have been more sublime. Orgasmic guitar solos dripping with pomp and splendor, fluid basslines, exotic flute, horn, and saxophone solos, elements of jazz fusion -- it's all there, and Wilson has arranged it like a master craftsman.<br /><br />Much of the buzz has centered around opening track &#34;Luminol,&#34; and for good reason. Thesong's backbone is its flowing and effusive bassline, which has been a typical theme in many of his works with Porcupine Tree, but it's been awhile since he's written one this effective. The character sketch is pretty detailed; Wilson describes the central character as an aged and wizened old man, strumming a guitar, playing songs he knew from long ago from dusty scratched LPs, but not scoring many style points while doing it.  Although the track includes a litany of solos from various instruments, its keynote characteristic is Govan's majestic and flowing solo on the guitar. The technical virtuosity in his playing is obvious and undeniable, but never feels gaudy or overblown.<br /><br />Many of Wilson's previous works, including Grace for Drowning, are heavily influenced by the 70s prog tradition, and Raven is no exception. Raven is not as depressingly dreary or murky as Grace for Drowning, but its influences often lead to many tracks possessing a sweeping and grandiose feel. &#34;Luminol&#34; is no exception. But even more bombastic is &#34;The Holy Drinker,&#34; the busiest, most dynamic, and most intricate of Raven's compositions. The army of keyboards and Hammond organs get a major workout here, while the story focuses on a man whose indulgences bring about his ruin. At least he's got an awesome soundtrack to do it to. The coda features a series of menacing King Crimson influenced scales, while Marco Minneman goes nuts with his pedal and crash symbol. This passage will most certainly have you cranking up your volume knob.<br /><br />&#34;Drive Home,&#34; meanwhile, is much more subdued and serene, the perfect soundtrack to gazing into the starry night sky. Its atmospheric sweeps and cool washes calm the mind after the opening blast of &#34;Luminol,&#34; and generates a sense of spaciness often associated with Pink Floyd. &#34;The Pin Drop&#34; is the least notable of Raven's tracks, but is also one of the most frenetic. It delivers the furor of a driving rainstorm, while also being the most jazz influenced with its volley of erratic horn and trumpet solos.<br /><br />In terms of storytelling, however, &#34;The Watchmaker&#34; is one of Wilson's most haunting tracks. With its focus on gentle acoustic guitar and lonely, forlorn flute solos, it truly feels like a storybook come to life. Thematically, this is the album's most disturbing and brooding track, which focuses on an elderly couple who meet a grisly end. But it becomes downright eerie thanks to the detailed description Wilson gives of the watchmaker's anguish at having led a wasted life.<br /><br />Finally, the title suite closes out the album on a haunting note. On the surface it's a sparse piano ballad, but Wilson gives it layers of depth with heartfelt lyrics and minor soul overtones,  The soul influence was something he and Mikael Akerfeldt began playing around with on &#34;Ljudet Innan&#34; from last year's Storm Corrosion album, but he uses it much more effectively here. It all adds up to a sensitive,  touching, and emotionally poignant finale that expresses a profound sense of loss and longing.<br /><br />His two previous projects, 2011's Grace for Drowning and 2012's Storm Corrosion were brilliant but flawed efforts, which showcased Wilson's intellect while feeling self indulgent. Raven tops those efforts and is at least as impressive as the last couple of Porcupine Tree albums. His stunning composition skills are matched by phenomenal instrumentation, and his method of structuring the album around individual stories makes each song fresh and unique. While it's still early, Raven is easily the best album of 2013 so far, and a work well deserving of serious study.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|AMAZING JUST AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't stop! Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Great actors + great direction + great script + great ending. That's what you get when you buy this movie.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It keeps me occupied in my free time and I love the time management. Also one of my favorite things is the crossbreading, although it is very hard to save up peanuts for animals since I only get one every day. At this rate I will never be able to get one animal.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Although parts ate disturbing, this stuff happens.  Well written.  Sky's boyfriend seems much older than he actually is but what a hero.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I went into this expecting to see a great movie and I got even more than I bargained for. I love this movie! All of the actors give a great performance and manage to keep you interested all the way to the end.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|Hugh Laurie comes from a comdedic actor background - He played the foppish prince in Black Adder - starring Roland Atkinson - Mr, Bean. He shpoes depth as an actor playing Gregory House on the TV series, and was playing the musical instruments - piano/guitar. I went to his concert and the way he brought to life the obscure lousiiana blues was awesome.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is more then just a game it becomes a dream come true like a virtual reality...I'M IN  LOVE WITH THIS
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Don't be stingy! Fork over the $3.99 and rent this film, you won't regret it. Affleck nailed it this time.
1401233791|5.0|I like this comic it was in excellent condition like the description and overall i really like this comic book
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Intense story. Enjoyed the two half brothers and ex-wife working together. Hard to put down. Kind of left me hanging at the end though.
B000X2H8G4|1.0|I bought this for my mother so that she could listen to TV without having to tune the sound up to max .... it seems to be a very good idea and I would say it's the right solution but it has a very short wire so she had to sit next to the TV which is not so convenient,<br /><br />I tried to add a 50' cable but it's a mess wires hanging around all the house ... in 1 word it's not home friendly.<br /><br />I'm going to return this one and order the same SE4000 but the one that has a Wireless Headphone (ASIN: B00BEL7LFG) , hope that will work out since no wires will be hanging around.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book made me believe and wish for love again. It was sweet and at the same time suspenseful. Great job!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is truly a masterpiece! From the time period to the family, this is a great series to watch and get hooked on.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's wonderful and pretty hot chemistry.  The sexiest parts where when they weren't having sex. I loved it. Can't wait for the next one
B0084U0IEG|5.0|As always Ian McEwan presents a well crafted novel. He shows great sensibility towards women's feelings and outlook of life since he successfully chose a woman as narrator. The plot is engaging and the ending is just that twist that characterizes McEwan's fiction. This novel is not only highly enjoyable but a pleasure to read.<br />Maria Calderon
1616550414|5.0|This book is a collectors item so it was warped in plastic plus is was properly secured in the box so it wouldn't move around and came just when i expected it
B0010V4TZU|5.0|Somebody scratched up my old coy of this cd and with a new album on the way I just had to brush up on my Vampire weekend.  They are headlining a music festival I am headed too this May.  I bought this album only to fall completely in love with it again, if you don't have this album in your collection, buy it!<br />One of my favorite albums ever.
B005AKFXZW|3.0|I enjoyed this book but I did find it hard to realy get going on. Worth a read but not exactly my taste.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is so nice to see stories about people instead of &#34;reality&#34; shows.  We have switched to watching mostly British dramas.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I always love Kate Moretons books. This was a rivetting read with an unexpected twist. I would highly reccomend it.
B008Q08T54|5.0|An action packed suspenseful and thought provoking movie. Parts of this movie may be true maybe not but I believe anything is possible.
B001O3B2M2|5.0|One of her best albums in my opinion.  I had to purchase the mp3 version of it because I lost my original cd years ago
B00003CXAA|5.0|I have the series on VHS tapes and had to make the dvd purchase. I love and have always been facinated with the story from beginning to end.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I don't understand how the biggest player in social networking can't get this right. Half the time, FB doesn't load, or it says \\"cannot retrieve photo please try later\\"....SO ANNOYING.  Also, why are photos so big? Geez, they take up the ENTIRE kindle screen---totally unnecessary.  Also, my comments and status updates just disappear. Lame.<br />I find myself going to my Iaptop to do anything on fb, because the kindle app seriously sucks.  Same when I try to do stuff on my new Droid Razr M...I guess FB doesn't care about its Android users.  Might be time to quit this ridiculous fb thing, I suppose.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Mark Wahlberg is the best. I enjoyed the action and the suspense. If you like watching movies about government conspiracies you will enjoy this movie. Lots of action guns blood and suspense to keep you saying OMG throughout the movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Thank you for offering Season 2 before Netflix.  Just started watching this series & NEEDED to watch next season.  Thank you
B000I3UMLQ|4.0|Classics are the best. I remember watching this as a kid. Was fun to watch it again so many years later.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good story to read,  like the drama and the twist at the end over all it was a good read
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I love that Android is now getting some really good point and click adventure games.  Tesla's Electric Mist is every bit as good as other famous mystery/adventure games like \\"The Lost City\\" and \\"The Secret of Grisly Manor\\", and honestly better because it's longer and more detailed, with many more puzzles and a more forgiving learning curve if you've never played this genre before.  The artwork is beautiful, and the music is conspicuously excellent (which is good, because in games like these you'll be hearing it a lot as you explore all the nooks and crannies of the game world).<br /><br />This is really well-made, and the hints function (what little I have used it for, out of haste - the game is not THAT obscure if you're familiar with the genre) works well.  Buy it!
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is kinda fun to play haha wish it had better graphics but still fun none the less lol
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|You know, there are some bands who have been doing the same thing for approximately the same amount of time as Helloween.  Manowar is a great example.  Manowar has a tried-and-true formula which has served them well for decades--but when the experiment even a little, they screw up.  And even their special formula gets a bit tired after a while.<br /><br />But with Helloween?  It stays fresh.  When they experiment, they come up with a masterpiece.  When they do what they do best, they continue to improve.  Straight Out of Hell = case in point.<br /><br />Straight Out of Hell is a wonderful display of all the best things about Helloween.  You can clearly tell that they are all master performers.  Great guitarists, superb singer and deft drummer.  They're usually not show-offs.  That is to say, they do things which are technically difficult, but the average listener who has no experience playing an instrument would never be able to guess just how hard it really is.  They want to create a good sound, first and foremost, not wow you with their prowess.  And they do!  Their songs are contain a pop appeal, in which they nail catchy choruses and melodies that are easy to follow, but at the same time, they retain an underlying complexity for those of us who need something more.  It's all there, and this album in particular delivers in spades.<br /><br />I've always been a Helloween fan.  I picked up their first album in 1999, about 14 years after it originally came out, and since then, I've been hooked.  Some of their albums didn't entirely catch on with me immediately except for a few songs, but this one?  I sat and listened to it all the way through as soon as it came in the mail.  It took a few listens to fully digest.  It was...wow.<br /><br />Get this.  Get it now.
B00A6VAW9W|4.0|The CD met my expectations of the artists.  The recording and packaging were superior.  This recording opens up the arena for more senior artists to enjoy the acclaim they deserve.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|Pretty deep movie and makes you realize just how short life can be.  We need to take time to enjoy all of GOD's creation because you never know when your journey on earth will end.
1457514508|5.0|I just loved this book and could not put it down. I look forward to a sequel or maybe even a movie made for TV? It has a \\"Melrose Place\\" feel with a difference. The places and characters are beautifully portrayed and I wish Duncan Whitehead every success with his writing.
B000NMW6M0|4.0|Six degrees of separation? Maybe more, maybe fewer; but, this movie gives us a lot of insight into just how connected we are and how significant that really can be.
B008PZYHX8|4.0|liked movie -like disater movies-good story and had some plot to it -liked tat I can stream movie, and not have to find the dvd
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best simple calculator out there. I definetly recommend it if you do not require a scientific calculator for simple transactions.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This makes one wish for a man of Lincoln's character and stature help solve some of the problems we face today. Abe had a genius of utilizing his rivals to accomplish his goals.<br /><br />John Herzfeld
B005D6O124|5.0|Ever since Crocs stop making the Mary Janes (so disappointed) i have been trying to find something similar because i wear them everyday at work and wanted something more on the feminine side. These are wonderful i usally wear a 9 in all my other crocs but found these to fit a little more snug than the usual wider crocs but still ok.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a remarkable account of an incident involving an American bomber pilot and a German fighter pilot. It not only gives the biographies of each, but the amazing story of how they both survived the war. How they lived subsequent to WW2 and how they were able to meet years later is an intereting read.<br /><br />John Herzfeld
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Doctor Who is wonderfully written show. It's cast and characters are brilliant! With amazon prime you can stream most of the series. I suggest you start at the beginning , although its written in such a way that's not necessary, and enjoy!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you want to know if I liked the product I’ll give you stars that is the best I can do. If I were able to give great reviews I would be getting paid to do so. I either like or don’t like but I can not tell you why other than I did not get anxious at any time.<br />This is one of the reasons I don’t usually participate in these types of reviews.
B005PK5C12|1.0|I really can't even begin to describe how terrible this show is.  The writers couldn't even maintain consistency within an episode, let alone between episodes.  I watched this for free, while sick and running a fever, and I still want my time and money back.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|complex characters..interesting interwoven history.. upstairs and downstairs provides a glimpse into the life of the &#34;upper&#34;class.<br />Look forward to season 3.
B008M721MS|3.0|Im new to Skype and need someone to help me figure it out... do i have to pay for voice calls?? Anybody!!!
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I'm not a big fan of all of the Alien Movies, but I have always liked the background details of movie story lines.  I definitely would watch it again!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching the Walking on the Dead on Netflix roughly a week and half go only to fall for this show. When i got to the end of season two Netflix did not go any further so, I turned to the internet to find the beginning half of season 3. When I saw Amazon had them for $2 an episode I was more willing to spend the $20 for the 10 missed episodes. Now I am caught up. The quality was perfect on Amazon and I had one moment where downloading took a little longer but, other than that Ill be turning to Amazon for anymore missed episodes.
B008COD5UI|5.0|Very Funny High School party movie. Good from the beginning to the end.  Need to make more movies like this.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|While it takes a dedicated effort to get through this great record of Lincoln and his cabinet, I believe it was well worth the effort. I have been and remain a student of history, especially when the writing includes true heros of the world. This book is so well written it reads less like a history lesson than most. The character development is so well done, one feels as though each character is at the very least a person in their own circle of friends. I found myself wanted to warn Mr. Lincoln of the impending doom, but knew I could not. That is how real the writing is. I am glad I purchased this book. I have it in hard copy, but after I received my Kindle the E-edition made reading even easier as I no longer had to hold the heavy book in my hands or on my lap. I recommend this book to all who admire Mr. Lincoln. Even those who may not should also read it, as they could take a lesson in how kind and generous and what a true humanitarian he really was.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|This was like watching an long episode of Family Guy.  If you like Family Guy, you will love this movie
B001NLCBJI|1.0|Took 20hours to download! I am an IT Director and know technology.  Our network at the time of download was just fine.  Hardwired to the TIVO!  Why 20hrs to download Amazon?
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Clarke can really do little wrong in my mind.  I had not read this so when it was a kindle deal, I thought why not?  Little did I know I would spend the next several hours unable to put the book down.  Others have mentioned the similarities to the movie Knowing.  Apparently the director even makes a reference in the film.  If you didn't like Knowing please don't let that put you off, this is far superior.  If you did like the flick, add this to your reading list.  Shoot add it either way, it's a quick read and worthy of your time.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Tom Cruise is in great form and totally believable as the action hero. The direction and cinematography is superb. This is by far the best feature in the franchise.
1449410243|4.0|I like the oatmeal site, this is a fun read and a good coffee table book as it always sparks a comment from guests.  Who doesn't need more laughter in their life?
B007H1HQW0|4.0|Great cutter, mild learning curve. I am getting about a 50/50 success ratio and I've only used it 3 times. Some times its me, sometimes its the bottle. All in all I like it, but was disappointed that they didn't send me any fine grit sand paper. I got 2 rough grit ones instead.
B003TNQEF0|4.0|This movie was depressing on so many levels.  I did not say bad, I said depressing.  If you think the human race is not that great, watching this film will confirm.  Spoiler- no happy endings for the &#34;good guys.&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game EVER!!!! BUY NOW!!! LOOK AT ME THROUGH YOUR SCREEN AND LISTEN CAREFULLY!!!!!  BUY RIGHT NOW!!!!!! AND THEN RATE IT 5 GOLDEN STARS!!!!:-D
B00APUQT7I|2.0|Man, I think I am over this series.  Not to say there were not ok moments, i can see how the maybe 8 and under crowd would still like them, but for the most part, please stop making these.  I don't even find the squirrel cute anymore,  and that is a shame.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Generally was a interesting account of a crisis.  I would exert the public to insist on a account of the CIA putting the Shaw into power which created the crisis in the first place so they had to then go in & rescue the embassy employees.  The CIA made the mess they had to then clean up.  Ironic is it not.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the book and need to see the movie before the second movies comes out this coming November.  Great!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|graphically similar, but gameplay and linear powerups are much more sensible and balanced. great time eater! just wish that cute oriental gal said more...be still my beating heart &lt;3!
B007SGM084|5.0|When people hear of this book, they immediately think of the sex scenes, I do not.  I could not wait to find out what happens to the characters next.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|THE BEST LOVE STORY ANYONE COULD READ! PERFECT BOOK FOR EVERYONE! Sad but so so good! I truly wish I had a LOVE story like Augustus and Hazel

B006MW3UZW|5.0|So glad to be able to have quality entertainment available, it is fresh, romantic and witty.... in the words of DA BRAVO!
B007UXT6T6|4.0|Just when I thought I was burned out on MI, they brought me back. Simon Pegg was awesome. I liked Renner too. Good team effort versus the Tom Cruise show.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I'm not a Cruise supporter, but he's been good in everything I've seen including this movie. Non-stop action. The standard MI plot goes out the window ... I don't want to spoil it for you. It's really a fun movie. Worth watching again.
0765328321|4.0|Eric Nylund's masterpiece detailing out the origin story of the Spartans, John 117, Halsey and everything that came before the video game (as far as the timeline goes. Obviously the book was written after the HALO release). Nylund really writes a solid story.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|This show is fantastic! I love how different each family is, and yet they're all so funny! I can't wait to watch more seasons.
1609611543|4.0|Thank you for this information. I am an avid researcher of health related information. I've known about the issues with grains for a couple years now. It's truely amazing how misinformation about the importance of eating grain has become. Sadly there is so much reliance on these products that it is very hard to break away from them. What should be common sense is not. Sadly people now go to drugs first which is nothing more than a bandaid instead of the source of the problem.<br /><br />Brian Caouette
B006MW3V6U|5.0|great show, wish I'd have watched it onPBS for free!<br />But if you missed it this will catch you up.
B0092YO8C6|5.0|I love Ross Lynch. I love his tv show and just listening to him every now and than I bought the album. The album has all the songs from there first season.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Have only watched the first two in the series but really like it so far!  Found it because I'm a Downton Abbey lover!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so addictive! My grandson plays Temple run and mow he wants to play Temple run 2.  I ca probably go for hours if I don't think about it. This is one game I would recommend.  If you have temple run, you.must get temple run 2. Love it!
B000SGSU58|4.0|With its many twists and turns, the story keeps your attention right to the end. The personal struggles of Bosch keep the book grounded.
B008EKOO46|5.0|In this book we are taught to not forget our real roots that make us what we are. This is a very simple but accurate bit of advice since we have not changed much biologically in thousands of years. I learned very much about how to carry on my life from reading this book. I only wish that I had read it years ago.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Loved the show. we missed it in the beginning and so we bought the series. Can't wait for seaso 4.
B005BZQVJ8|3.0|The movie was a great parody of liberalism and found the lines and acting really good. Most telling was when Paul \\"enlightened\\" the leading girl, don't remember name, and she immediately goes into a rant of cuss words and wants to fornicate and do drugs. Very telling of the liberal ideology, promises enlightenment and higher knowledge but ends in the gutter...no solutions for world hunger, AIDS or war...just a one way self absorbed trip to the gutter. Also exposes the liberals weak minded view of Christians. Can only view a 2000 year old global religion as some rednecks in a trailer park. No Cathedrals or great works of arts...just a fool with a shotgun in a trailer park. The main character's paranoia was very well acted. Anything not like them was scary and feared.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I liked it,it was a good read. It was easy to follow and kept you guessing. Exciting to the end
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Great in the beginning but drags on and on torturing you with the lead characters mistakes.  The crash scene is hearth-pounding and Denzel is great as usual.
0765325950|5.0|Such a good ending to a great series. you wont regret reading this incredible book. Brandon does a great job finishing it up. Wish Robert Jordan could have, but he is a great substitute, as good as anyone else could have
B0013F1D02|5.0|This movie was wonderfully done. If you're looking for a light-hearted movie that is thoroughly done Stardust is an excellent choice. You finish the movie with that &#34;I've have been thoroughly entertained&#34; feeling.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I rec'd a Kindle for Christmas...this is the first thing I've watched on it. It is my new obsession....a wonderful escape from our current less genteel times. The photography is breathtaking and the characters believable. It's a very engrossing glimpse of the past and the plots are quick to change. I highly recommend it!
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|For a bunch of old coots, this isn't bad.  Actually I think music sounds better than they did for 'Song Remains the Same'.
B000FCK65W|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a hard to put down. The author really brings out the liveliness of the characters. I don't usually read books twice but I would pick this one up and read it again
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I bought the the 3 book bundle and read it straight through. Story line was great, loved the characters. Can't wait to see what happens next. The editing could be better, wrong words used in the wrong places, like (would - instead of wood, creak - instead of creek). But overall a good read. If you like fantasy you will love these books.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|HBO's television production of G.R.R. Martin's Song of Fire & Ice is top notch and matches the quality of one of the best Fantasy book series of all time.  The actors throughout are well chosen and impressive, with particular kudos to Sean Bean as Eddard Stark and Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister.  Worldwide film locations are astoundingly beautiful.  The script writing and production team of David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are capturing the mood and tone of the novels well, moving the quite elaborate plot forward in an entertaining fashion without missing or altering much detail from G.R.R. Martin's books.<br /><br />Only gripe is that the film production is a bit more raunchy with the sex and nudity than it needs to be, but this is inline with the books, I suppose.<br /><br />This is the treatment that The Lord of the Rings deserved.  Several years of high production value one hour televsion series.  I hope to see that some day, still.  The reason being, is that this allows for the capturing of much more detail and to remain more faithful to the books.  That isnt to say that Peter Jackson's 3 film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings wasnt well done or enjoyable....and I hear that the 3 films slated to cover The Hobbit will delve into the Silmarillion and flesh out the backstory of the ressurection of Sauron....which is nice.  (Though I can do without the gimmicky 3D nonsense).<br /><br />Well done.  Highly recommended.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am convinced that Hunger Games trilogy can't be simply labeled as a good read; it is an alternate reality, it is an experience. The characters are so real and the descriptions so vivid that it demands emotional involvement. I cried with it and went through such genuine emotions that I wasn't aware existed in me. There is just no way to read this book and not feel it. The ending feels a bit abrupt but then most trilogies meet such fate. Nonetheless, these books top the list of my favorites and I intend to revisit them in a few years. Can not recommend them enough!
B00008K7AM|5.0|Bought this movie because my husband had never seen it. HE LOVED IT!! If you like Rob Schneider then you should watch this movie.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Pretty much Mario Brothers all over again, but simplified a bit so not really very hard to play.  I liked that fact- not as frustrating as the original Nintendo version.  Makes no sense that it is a leprechaun but it made no sense it was a plumber so....<br /><br />It is more a trip down memory lane than a game with replay value.  I doubt I would play it again after finishing it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This entire series is absolutely outstanding. I can't wait for more !!!  I truely need this fix. This is the best I've ever read.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|everyone who has ever been trying to catch a flight and runs into one delay after another knows on a small scale the tension shown in the movie
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Does it need a review? If you have watched the previous three seasons and you are ready for season 4, then you know how great and addicting show this is.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|This is by far the best Anime I have seen during my time on this earth. Which leads me to believe that the Oscar's is a sham and driven towards box office and movie politics. Not even a nomination.. This batman anime is different and does not follow the traditional bubble gum animations. Its Dark, Gritty and at times disturbing, its what the world of batman should be. I give massive kudos to the makers of this film and the voice work is done superbly. Keep em coming guys! I can wait for part 3!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Loving this! Challenging and addictive, excellent graphics and likeable characters. Not very far into game but seems like 80 levels plus? And its free, what's not to like! Excuse me must get back to game.
B00138H146|5.0|This is just a classic album. It's a must for anyone who enjoys classic rock! I have always loved Rock and Roll Animal.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app really helps me out in the morning when I got to go to school try it you will love it
B00821OX98|5.0|When I decided to watch Falling Skies, I didn't expect it to be that good. Good production and acting. I was always excited to watch one episode after the other :)
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|it was awesome at first but than I couldnt load it it just kept on trying to download. Im soooo sad. Ive tried downloading it and still not working... gonna try again. but its just a warning it might happen to you too. it still an awesome game.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing book! Very fast read couldn't put the book down I highly recommend it!!! Not your typical coming of age book..much better!
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Winter of the World, the second book in the Trilogy, is not as engrossing as the first in the series, Fall of Giants. However for old-timers like me born before the World War II, it is an interesting recap of the events familiar to me, history melded very well with fiction. Surely an interesting read, and am now looking forward to the 3rd book in the Trilogy
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It s truly a amazing show full of drama intrigue and excitement. You never know what to expect from each epsiode.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was wildly entertaining! I read a review that warned that you may not get the happy ending you usually like but I loved this from beginning to end.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Amazing attention to details and 80's references.  A book you will not want to put down.  Lots of suspense.  Is also very thought provoking in terms of where society is headed with technology.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book, if you are looking for a great new series by Rick Riordan.  Very exciting, lots of action, and if you buy it, make sure you have read the Percy Jackson series first, or you'll not know what what is happening for the whole book.  Also, read the previous books before you read this.  It's no doubt an amazing book, you will not waste your money.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Watched this movie with my teenage daughter. She liked it. Teenage problems never seem to change. The material is strong would not watch with younger kids
B000SEJHRA|4.0|Very funny, and entertaining, and easy readin'!  [...] If you want to continue the laughter, and great originality, get yourself a copy of Howie Weener Unclogged: A colonic noir musical memoir!  Funny funny funny stuff...
B00271HAK8|5.0|Still Funny after all these years. They reference this movie in lots of other films so my daughter has been asking to wach it.
B00AQSF6BO|5.0|This is another superb album from Maestro Vicente, but I admit to being a great aficionado of Vicente's work.  But since Paco de Luc&iacute;a called Vicente his most likely successor, and Pat Matheny called him the greatest guitarist in the world, I'm not in bad company.  In this album, which debuted January 18 at the prestigious international Celtic Connections 2013 in Glasgow, Scotland, Vicente is joined by Michael McGoldrick on whistle, pipes and flutes, John McCusker on fiddle and Danny Cummings on drums and percussion, all from the band of Dire Strait's Mark Knopfler; and Ewan Vernal on bass and Donald Shaw on accordion from the Gaelic folk band Capercaillie.<br /><br />As you might guess, this is not an album for flamenco purists, but its fusion of flamenco and Celtic music is both irresistible and seductive - and it took a musician of the stature of Vicente Amigo to pull it off.  There's nothing like hearing top-tier Celtic musicians weaving aural knots \\"por buler&iacute;as\\" or pouring a bit of smoky, peaty whiskey over a rumba.  (Now that's what I call \\"salsa.\\")  There's also the expected Vicente \\"bolero,\\" this one dedicated to his parents, and Vicente sings on some of the cuts as well.<br /><br />This fusion of flamenco and Celtic music is, however, not so far afield as one might assume at first glance.  The first layer of civilization in Spain's richly stratified cultural history was what historians have named \\"Celt-Iberian.\\"  This was followed by the successive contributions of Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths - and the Arabs, Berbers, and other Africans which composed the nine centuries of Muslim habitation.  Sprinkled on top like spice are the contributions of the Gypsies and the bits of Latin America brought back to Spain in the last five centuries, all of which ultimately produced what is known as flamenco - itself consequently a quintessentially \\"fusion\\" art form, one of the greatest of them all.  Vicente has thus in a sense brought flamenco full circle in joining his art with these latter-day Celts, a circle which can justly be called magical after listening to this album.<br /><br />All in all, just the album to play on a beautiful afternoon cruising with the top down, and it's got Grammy Awards written all over it.  The question is, however, in what category?  World Music at the \\"regular\\" Grammy's?  Flamenco at the Latin Grammies?  This album transcends them all, and we're all the better for it.  Bravo - and Ol&eacute; - Vicente, and kudos to every artist on this album.full circle in joining his art with these latter-day Celts, a circle which can justly be called magical after listening to this album.<br /><br />All in all, just the album to play on a beautiful afternoon cruising with the top down, and it's got Grammy Awards written all over it.

B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Maybe we're prudish but when the number of `F' words exceeds 100 halfway thru the film it's too much for us.
1419705849|5.0|my daughter (9) has read this ~20 times since she received this for Christmas.  I don't know much more about it, although she loves it.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This show is so addictive,  makes you wanna quit work just to give more time to watch.  LOL.  Great writing,  the story flows so well!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My friends talked about it ; my family; the person I don't like; all adnausium talked how great this series was.  Now after seeing season one I too can be one of many that coos about the characters, the writing and the drama. Jeesh. Now I have something nice to say to my pain-in-the-arse-relative.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best zombie shows ever. Really enjoy the fight for life and for each other! All the characters are good actors and always keep us on edge:)
B007BT0RKG|3.0|It is ok for a free map kinda expected a little more. You need to download the state before traveling unless you have access to the internet
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is awesome, it's free, and good you should get this app I love this app evens though I just got it
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and the convenience of using the Amazon program. Was uncertain of how all would work out; I was pleasantly surprised of how easily it was accomplished.<br /><br />Good movie, good process.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was slow getting into, then I couldn't put it down. But, Disappointed with the ending of this book. X
B002L3ARRU|5.0|This movie is a true original. Ferris Bueller, the eternal optimist, uses every trick in the book to have the best day ever. Stars Jennifer Gray and Matthew Broderick, with a cameo by Charlie Sheen.
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|I have been a fan of this band for longer than I care to admit. I am pleased with the result of the reunion. It was also nice to see them actually include a first on this album. The songs that the band selected for this performance, were well chosen and adequately spanned their catalog. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys timeless classic rock.
B00AG6Z92C|2.0|I bought two copies of this cd, one for myself, and one as a gift. Mine will not play in our Bose cd player, nor in the car - a 2011 Toyota with an excellent sound system. Keep getting disk error messages and have to take the cd out, blow on it, fiddle with it, and finally it may play. If it does, it sounds good and I enjoy it. Not sure about the copy I recently gave as a gift. We cleaned all of our disk players when we encountered this problem, but to no avail, and other cd's play just fine. What's up with this, and may I return one or both cd's if necessary?
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie was and is of Bruce Willis. This film could have been called Die Some Other Time!<br />At least it had a good story line, even though its repetitious nature conforms to this stereo story.<br />The boy grew up bad because Bruce came back to stop the boy from<br />growing up as a bad man?
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It is entertaining & informative.  It's easy to understand sometimes difficult ideas and ties it all together in a way that made me understand life is 'FUN.  Get it, read it, live it.
0783240236|5.0|My absolute favorite Hitchcock movie! Amazing! Done without a soundtrack, & you hardly even notice because the film is so intense! The school scene may be the best ever in horror! Great effects for it's day! This film exudes monstrous meance, from something as innocuous as birds! Absolute, terrifying genius!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I chose this book for a light read while on vacation. It's was quick, easy, and enjoyable. Great if you're looking for a cute story to get through in a day or two.
B0054SMID0|4.0|The movie was another class for Matthew McConaughey as he keeps you on your seat the entire team. Really enjoyed the storyline and his tenacity.
B004WR125O|1.0|DIDN'T WORK... AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY ROUTER IS ONLY 18 FEET FROM MY ONKYO RECIEVER. THIS LAN ADAPTER IS POORLY MADE.... DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!
B008DKBQMK|5.0|I bought this case along with another one after I received the Kindle Fire for Christmas from my husband.  I wanted one that would protect my Kindle while traveling or carrying around often.  This definitely works and is very good quality!  I would highly recommend it.
B00BESLT6G|5.0|Loved it it was great I love all silent hill stuff games and movies. I would recommend this to any horror fan
B005I6EU7U|5.0|My husband gifted me a Kindle for Christmas (the Fire, but not the HD, I think) and I wanted some cute cases for it.  This is adorable, looks like an old book and the quality is great.  I definitely feel like my Kindle is protected whether it is in my purse, on a shelf, in the car, etc...  I would highly recommend this!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This Downton will touch you and affect you. At the conclusion of it, you'll be totally engrossed in the profundity of the writing and acting in this English melodrama. Everything about season 3 will leave hungering for more!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved the way the author has written about what he remembers and what was going on around him knitted all togheter just so greatly!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Omg I loved this book can't wait to start the next one. Best book I read in awhile. I like how she was so sure she didn't love them now she looking at that she have feelings for both. The action and romance between them was electrifying.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|Very cool concept.  My kids loved it!  What a great escape from the reality of the nightly news yet it teaches the youth to accept eachother's differences.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I'm finally starting at the beginning and watching all past seasons.  I just love this show!  The combination of storylines and singing/dancing are just great!  Makes you want to get up and dance!!
B00BHMETKC|1.0|I am more than upset.  We ordered up Argo and sat down to watch in streaming to our TV.  It took 15 minutes for the movie to start and it lasted 2 minutes and then went into some sort of buffering mode for another 8 minutes.  The movie than ran for about 10 minutes and again went into a buffering mode for 10 minutes!  We turned it off and felt that this was a total failure and clearly a waste of money and TIME!  We saw 10 minutes of a movie and 30 minutes of a blue bar inching its way across our screen.  Pathetic!
1400069807|5.0|If you're in the processed food industry, buy this book.  If you're in the advertising industry, buy this book.  If you have ever eating food out of a box, a can, a bag, anything wrapped in plastic or tin foil, buy this book.  You're part of the story.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of accompanying Michael Moss on one of his reporting trips to the Monell laboratories in Philadelphia, which were doing research on \\"the bliss point,\\" the precise amount of sweetness that makes food most enjoyable.  Not only does he accurately represent peoples' opinions (he's an excellent journalist - he did, after all, win the Pulitzer Prize) but he paints a wonderful portrait of the bizarre world of processed foods.  That, I believe, is one of the keys to the book's excellence - it's a lot of fun to read.  It's kind of wonderful to read about so many familiar products: lunchables, coke, kool-aid, and to learn how they were invented and brought to market.<br /><br />In the end, this book satisfies a deeper hunger for knowledge.  Moss invites us to see the industry as it actually is: filled with almost-heros and almost-villians, extraordinary intrigue, and of course, sugar, fat, and salt.<br /><br />If we are indeed what we eat, this is a book about how we became what we are.  Read it.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|This was such a great family movie.  It was actually reccommended by my husband. A smart well-written story with colorful characters...just animated!
B003AKLFAG|5.0|I can promise you that you have never seen a movie like this twisted but very good. Watch this one you won't regret it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie!  I was on the edge of my seat during the entire film, even knowing the outcome.  Perfectly cast!
B00B935SUY|5.0|The timing of watching this was perfect for me (working in an analog studio right now). It's a reminder for us to not lose track of that magical thing that digital cannot capture - human chemistry and interaction. Watching the whole process was fascinating. The film hit the mark on the nostalgia of the era that Sound City existed in with sincere recollections by everyone impacted by The Board. Bittersweet to see it moved from its home, and just as dazzling to see Dave Grohl's project for bringing it back to life in its new abode. Well done, and so sorry to see Sound City gone.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I actually bought &#34;The Sound Of Music&#34; for my uncle. I did not watch it and he does not yet have a Blu-Ray player, but he was well pleased with the quality of the standard DVD disc and what special features were offered on that disc. The movie did ship quickly and came in good condition.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|It was a good action movie w/ some terriffic stunts but because it's the third one it's kind of lost some of the excitement about it.  It was well played by the actors but again it was pretty easy to figure out the plot and to see what was coming next.  Plus some of the gadgets were pretty far fetched but I guess that's par for the course for MI3 huh??....lol!!!  Overall it was a good action movie and since it was free thru the Prime Membership it was worth the money so to speak...lol!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Whether you're in business, an artist, carpenter or just want a good read - this book is for you.<br />Steve Job was a complicated man who pushed beyond limits. He had the capability to see into the future and look at the whole picture.<br />He was admired by many great men/women yet he was difficult to work with.<br />We lost a genius that helped shape the world we live in.<br />I can't say enough about how much you will get out of reading about the life of Steve Jobs.<br />A must read!
B0049J2BSM|4.0|We watched this with our kids this past weekend and I was reminded how funny and enjoyable this movie was.  Our kids thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This book really sets the premise for what's about to come next, at times the story drags and nothing really exciting happens. Great book over all, and it is followed by fan favorite 'a Storm of Swords'.
B009SSGBOE|4.0|After the first few listens, Im happy with this new album by one of my favorite (living) artists.  That cool sound that we expect from Mr. Fagen is still alive and well.  Perhaps not as tight and varied as MORPH THE CAT,  this album is easy on the ears and most enjoyable
B003D0ZNWY|2.0|Not too impressed with Mahler, as a whole there is a lot of pieces that are just not that good, I was told by others that Mahler was great...i just don't like him ,other than a very few select pieces. Music is hard to judge, so I would say you would have to hear it first to know if you like him, and I failed to do that before buying. lesson learned!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|i dnt car becas im 4 and eat poopy I lik chezz dips in choklat who reading ths is a poopy pants
B009CPES4I|5.0|This is a wonderful movie - great storyline, fabulous actors, beautiful scenery.  It's thoughtful, funny, a bit wistful at times...and thoroughly enjoyable.
B000IDEQTK|4.0|This movie was not what I had expected. It turned out to be a sweet  and yet sad story... I recommend it if you need a movie to just relax and enjoy.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I grew up watching this show I even had a Six million dollar man Halloween costume, how cute I looked at six or seven
B003ASLJO0|5.0|This is such a great movie!  Clint Eastwood is a legend, no matter how old he is!  He is a great actor!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great read! Didn't want it to end.  Nice ending happily ever after.<br /><br />Will look for more from Mira Lyn Kelly.
B009O07NDY|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my brother as a birthday gift.  He loved it!  The music is awesome in the movie and the added bonus of using your smartphone to open additional secrets was bonus!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I sat and watched the movie at least 5 times.  Each time I liked it even more than the preceding time.  It was well written, the acting was believable, and the direction was great.  Ben Aflec did a superb job.  What I liked most, was that this was a true story.  This was a story that needed to come out.  Our country needs heroes, And this picture fits the bill.  We owe a debt of gratitude to Canada that can never be repaid. I would recommend this movie to everyone.  Our country needs to see this. This movie is a must see!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie was awesome in IMAX and it is one of the best, if not the best, Bond movie of all time.  We get a glimpse into 007's past and the scenery is magnificent.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This was the most expensive book I have purchased for my Kindle and it was for my book club.  I must say it never fully got my attention and may not have finished it, if I didn't have to for my book club.  It was just okay and the ending was horribly disappointing.
B0049J3QF4|4.0|Cute and fun, but lags a little in the middle. My kids got bored after an hour, but they are only 2 and 4. My son did love the characters though.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Buy it! This is one of the funniest movies ever and, at the same time, a little scary with its insights/inferences into government heads. All the acting is 4 star with Peter Sellers way out there!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely loved all 3 seasons.  I can't wait for season 4 to come out.  It is an outstanding TV show
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Beautiful movie, story and person! Having been into music all of my life, I am amazed that I had never heard of this incredible musician and thank the movie for telling me. Via Rodriguez!
B004N6369Y|5.0|I always love Danielle Steel!!<br />I especially loved reading this as my first book on my new kindle.<br />As always her stories are awesome!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good mystery game. I liked the search and find as well. I found that using hints to find out where to go next was a huge help. Loved this game!!!
B001KT6JPA|5.0|This is a great movie. Every time I watch it I feel completely disturbed. The actors do a great job in this movie.
B008FTAAG2|4.0|Sexy, raw, angry, sentimental at times, but mostly edgy raw power. Beautiful haunting skilled vocals on the one track that's more like a ballad.  I like this album a lot!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel did it again. This is an excellent movie that keeps you entertained from start to finish. Not what I had expected.
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|I was really surprise to find out about her MMA background because of the solid acting job she did in this movie. The young lady can act and she looks stunning (when she cleans up) ;as well as, she can seriously &#34;whip butt.&#34; I look forward to seeing more of her work. If you we're ever going to bring back Wonder Woman - the time is now!
B007IK44CK|5.0|I don't find too many sequels as good as the original but Cruise did it with this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Looper was a great ride, and definitely not what I expected. Without giving the movie away, treat yourself to this film one evening and you wont regret it.
B00000K0DT|5.0|If you love Kevin Spacey you will love this movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet you should absolutely definitely watch it because it is a classic and wonderful!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Never thought I would get into an English drama, but I can't get enough of this one!!!!  What a fantastic show.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I actually listened to this book in audio form while driving across the country. It was very entertaining and, being a classics minor in college, the incorporation of classical myth made me smile. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a solid, well written story to entertain them!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I LOVE Denzel. I did not care for this movie at all. It was slow, depressing & boring. Would not reccommend to anyone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|And just when you think you've got it all figured out.......<br />Keeps you interested and is fast paced, thought provoking.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|A little slow starter but man was it great! THe cast is wonderful, storyline even better and the ending! WOW!
B0057R5XRG|5.0|These moves are action packed and entertaining for the family.  All children love diansours my great nephew has watched these moves over and over again.
B004NEY9EW|1.0|James Bond is no longer a suave, strong, confident British secret agent.  He is now a bi-sexual, weak-minded drunk that struggles with childhood issues.  What a huge disappointment.
B005ZO6NRA|4.0|I have seen the orignal Conan and it was entertaining but I could stop it and come back to watch when I was done with whatever I was doing.  This re-make of Conan was so much better and I sat through the movie and hated when it ended.  I would recoomend this to watch on a weekend when you had time to just sit and enjoy.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|This movie is much better than Quantum of Solace but they have sunk the Bond character even deeper into his mixed up bi-sexual, weak new character.  I doubt I'll watch another Bond movie.
B000000ZGN|5.0|The best by the time I get to phenix  Is the best song ever well one of them that is
B008X8QCTO|4.0|This was a good game.  Early reviews because of it not being &quot;free&quot;have hurt the overall ratings.  Also the &quot;pay more later&quot; hurt scores.  They apparently listened.  I paid. 99 and the rest of the game was free when I hit that point.  Literally you are mid action when it prompts you to continue....but now it is at no cost.  I liked the adventure as the HO.  Entertaining.  Would have paid a bit more than the buck.  Also not a short game plus has a bonus chapter!  Worth it.
0857860801|5.0|Very funny cartoon!, i love these books. they are just how imagine a cat, sorry spoiled cat would behave !.I f you want a good laugh buy this book, i highly recommend it.
B008220DIC|5.0|This movie is insane. The acting is absolutely incredible. Phoenix, Hoffman, and Adams are all at the top of their game here, but Joaquin Phoenix steals the show. He gives one of the most phenomenal performances of the past decade (on caliber with Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood). If you are a fan of PTA, especially There Will Be Blood, this is a must see. Oh, and I got it the day before it came out. Thanks Amazon.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Always loved Boston from when they first started. i think this is one if not the best album they ever made. listen to it and see what you think.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|His previous album had some great moments but was, IMHO, at least 30 minutes too long.  (Raider II in particular was ridiculous).  This is a lot tighter and a lot better, and is destined to be a classic.  Not a weak moment here.  This stands alongside his best work with PT (and it wipes the floor with The Incident).
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Yes if you are in need of a Mac attack ( Fleetwood ) then this is the perfect CD for you. A fantastic band .
B00992CF6W|5.0|I waited and waited for Minecraft to enter the Kindle Fire app store and when it did I knew I would buy it so I did and now I love it!
184767481X|5.0|Even if you are not a cat person you will love this cartoon!, the cartoonist catches the antics of a cat ( his own i believe ) perfectly.
B0045TYDNC|4.0|It's fine. I actually prefer the older model as it seems to go on a little easier. (I have both) But hey, the price was much better and it does work.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wife and I can't get enough of the show.  Absolutely wonderful.  Story is awesome, suspenseful, everything you would want in a show that keeps you wanting to watch.
0307352145|5.0|It really helped me to understand me and why I need to spend time alone and why sometimes being with a group or at a party is just not good for me. It's a great read for introverts and for extroverts who spend time with introverts. She also has great ideas for work places and education settings to make things more beneficial to introverts.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Ireally enjoyed Downton Abbey. It kept you wanting to see the next season. The characters had your attention from the very beginning and you really didn't want it to end. The castle inside and out was so beautiful. And the time era was something that I really enjoyed.
B004V43ZQC|5.0|The first couple of chapters I felt lost but all of a sudden it clicked and I had to go back and reread the first two chapters.  This book had me laughing all the way through!  I am in a book club at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth and everyone who finished this quick read loved it.  I am anxious to read more from this author!
B003L77G8I|5.0|DVD quality was great-no complaints-Price also was good-better than local retailers.  Love this series!!!  The characters have been well developed, and their back stories are rich--very good writing!!  I thought maybe when Seeley and Brennan got &#34;together&#34; it would have a negative impact on the show, but it was tastefully done and I love seeing them as parents.  Regarding Brennan-Emily Deschanel has had a wonderful opportunity to display her level of acting ability in how she has brought her character forward, matured her, brought her out of her own narcissistic ego-mania and she has learned how to care about other people-kudos to you Emily!<br />If you like this series, you would also probably like &#34;Sanctuary&#34;, or &#34;Fringe&#34;-both have strong female leads, interesting stories and characters.
030745455X|5.0|I enjoy this series tremendously and this book did not disappoint.  It's a shame the author's father and brother won't let his girlfriend finishe the series, especially since she has been instrumetal in authoring the other books.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is one of the most addictive games I have ever gotten whole of. Simple yet enjoyable gameplay keeps me feeding coins into this machine.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|A well-done follow up to the first movie.  This was a Christmas gift for my father who really enjoyed this series.  Item arrived very quickly and as described, brand new in the package.  Great deal and I didn't have to fight Walmart crowds at Christmas time!
B007712XAU|5.0|Could not stop watching until the end.<br />Looking forwards to more episodes.<br />Would recommend it to anyone I know.  Good
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved the plot, but I didn't like how it ended........<br />Lots of action with romance however the ending just leaves you wondering...
B003SI3URQ|1.0|I was shocked at the content in the jest 10 minutes of this movie. I was horrified to hear what they were talking about and teaching our children. I immediately turned it off and we will never allow this movie in our house!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Out of the 3 seasons, this is probably the slowest but still very entertaining.  Characters are great, actors are well chosen for their roles.  Maggie Smith is outstanding!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This author had a good plot and book began as a page turner, but certain details (like the diary) became obvious to me and the ending was a total disaster.  I've read other reviews, including a couple offering much psycho-babble regarding the main characters and justification for the ending.  Yes, the author did an excellent job defining these characters, although one had to wonder if Amy was a psycopath from birth or as a result of her parents.  But as other reviewers have stated, it seemed as though Ms. Flynn got tired of writing or couldn't justify having her book end with what normal readers might expect since her characters were so abnormal.  I would not recommend this book.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|just what I was looking for! IT was packaged perfectly and works great. Thanks for care about what you send out to customers some people don't.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Love all the twists and unique plots.  Getting it with Amazon Prime makes it even better since it's so cheap.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This is a great movie for family night.  Great kids movie that helps portray otherwise &#34;scary&#34; characters into funny and lovable.  It also conveys a message about family and the importance of being honest with each other and also accepting others despite fears by getting to know them better. Highly recommended movie.
B002QZ399G|5.0|Enjoyed it a lot.  As an amateur economist I really appreciated this movie.  It showed our real interests in foreign oil and what were willing to do to get our hands on it.
0307010856|5.0|My mom had read this to me when I was little and she bought me one a few years back.  I bought this one for my friend's daughter.  It's such a sweet little book!  Definitely recommend!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story the ending will definitely shock you. I finished the book in less than a week! Nicholas Sparks has done it again.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|This movie was fantastic. The effect were great and the fight sense were terrific. I is a must see in my book!
1416511946|5.0|Awesome book. whipped thru it in under day. easy read language-wise and there is alot of stuff you can skip over in the book<br /><br />a few thoughts:<br /><br />crazy how much alcohol and how many drugs these guys. funny that they seem to think drinking copious amounts jack daniels and doing alot of coke is semi-clean. as opposed to heroin which they consider unbelievably destructive<br /><br />if a 14 year old reads this book, will he be turned off or turned on by the behaviour in this book? does this book glorify drugs and alcohol? i think maybe it does. i saw the lead singer in LA Guns make this point.<br /><br />Nikki seems half delusional about record sales. like Whitney Houston didn't sell alot of records. i see she has 2 of her own albums over 20 million sales and a movie soundtrack that no one would know if not for whitney at 45 million sales. note: nikki seemed to think whitney's album beat motley's on the charts because of payola.<br /><br />nikki doesn't seem ashamed of his behaviour when he was on drugs. some of the things he did were terrible
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was absolutely hilarious and I found myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions while reading it.  Highly recommend!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris puts you in the fray with him. His descriptive and sometimes brutally honest ways of explaining what he did and why are fascinating. He makes no excuses, and the reader knows why. At the same time, he brings a very human side to the war, and deployments. He was a true hero. RIP Chris Kyle.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I bought this for my 2 year old niece for christmas and she loves it!  She walks around the house singing &#34;Tomorrow&#34; all day!
B004TN7QPG|5.0|I replaced Aldiko pro with this app. Aldiko crashed very frequently. If you moved your tablet and the screen orientation changed, it crashed. This seems to be a much more stable app with many personalization features. So far so good. Reads multiple formats. I use PDF and Epub.
1449410243|5.0|The things that are the funniest in life are the things that speak truth and if you know anything at all about felines you know not only is this book plausible but probable. Cat's are plotting and it's high time it was published. What a lark, what a cat romp! The Oatmeal and his ingenious book has said it all. The Bob Cats section is to die for, and what a way to go...laughing. I can't say enough about this book, there is not one turd in it's litter box, unsoiled and brilliant!
B005PK1G76|5.0|I ordered this to accessorize my stroller and to have extra storage for small items within reach while strolling. It's been a year and I still use it.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Ok I liked the hit song you hear on the radio...and didn't know what to expect from the album, and it blew me away.  Some funky beats.  Some feel good sing along songs.  Some more quiet and somber ballads.  And I don't think this is something I'll get tired of, even after hundreds of plays.  I'm only on dozens of plays now and it gets better each time!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We heard lots of praise from some friends. Not sure what the big deal was, but my wife has now watched all 3 seasons in a couple of weeks and was wondering when season 4 would be available.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|The film is very realistic and absolutely captures the horrendous conditions of the trench warfare.  The acting is excellent and the scenery at the beginning of the film made us homesick for the glorious countryside of Devonshire, England.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Watched for the first time and now I am addicted. Beware.<br />Each episode leaves you wanting to see what happens next.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I needed to catch up on Season1 after beginning to watch<br />Season 2 this fall.  Wow, what a show- its got it all, pretty<br />princesses, handsome princes, wicked queens and one<br />seriously sexy Rumplestilskin, played to the hilt by Scottish<br />character actor, Robert Carlyle.  Well written tale of fantasy<br />with a big dose of reality.  If you are new to the series, Season 1<br />is a must and this edition has all 22 episodes plus bonus material.<br />Everything you need for some good old fashioned Sunday fun, but<br />beware this is not Disney!
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Interesting. I am not a runner but enjoyed learning about this group of people and how they are able to physically run like they do.
0765325950|4.0|I really liked the series, and the last book sums it up nicely.  I was a little disappointed in the way the book ended (no spoiler).  I really loved the series, and I'm glad that it's been finished.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson did a great job of wrapping up the series and I'm very grateful to him for doing (and being allowed to do) so.
B005VPRET4|5.0|My girls who are 7 and 5 love Friends Lego.  The Lego pieces are tiny but fun to build. I like the girly colors.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved hiking the PCT from my house.  The vivid description of her journey both outwardly and inwardly captivated me.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This is most definitely a biased review...I'm nearly obsessed with all things &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;.  In this particular package, I found a download code for a free version on iPad or iPhone.  Downloaded through the free Amazon Video app and now I can watch it anywhere.  Only thing is the downloaded version doesn't have any bonus features, but the DVD does and ALL of them are amazing!  Pre-ordered way back when (Amazon has the best price) and also received a credit as the price had come down even lower.<br /><br />For readers and non-readers alike...although if you haven't read the series, my only question is &#34;Why Not?&#34;...this is a great collection to get totally lost in.
1451696191|5.0|there was really nothing i disliked about my purchase recieved befor the arrival date. love reading this is one amazing book i just purchased the movie as well.
B008M721MS|1.0|I think that this kindle should have oovoo instead of Skype. First of all its too slow and most of the time I have to turn on my camera.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|A simple idea well executed. This book is moderately entertaining and decently written. I would buy another of her books.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|a very well descibed book. the down side is that i have to wait until fall 2013 to  get the house of hades. i can't wait till then
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I this app is meant for All the Lps lovers out there in the world , this app is made for you.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I loved the game but I couldn't get past the score 5,000 it might be easy for people under twelve but it's hard for me
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Finally, a Batman who's as troubled as the evil doers he's fighting. No person is 100% good or 100% evil and this is played out with every scene.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|I got this based on reviews it downloaded very quickly but when I went to go play it the game said it had to load additional data.The ammount of data it needed to download a huge ammount.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Another good hidden object from g5.Good story line and great graphics.l have bought most of the g5 games for the Kindle Fire and have enjoyed most of them.
B0076DELIG|5.0|What can I say?  Another Michael Connelly winner!  I have read almost every book I can get about Harry Bosch and it doesn't matter which book I choose, once I begin reading I find it difficult to stop.  Who wants to watch a TV program when you can read another intriguing mystery novel.  Each story has a twist.  Believe me you just can't stop reading.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|Bought as a christmas present, arrived on time, packaging perfect!!!  Huge hit, my 5 year old neice loves it plays with it everyday!
B00000K2VZ|4.0|Listening to this album brings back many many memories from the 70's.  This gift just keeps on giving.  R.I.P. Janis.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|Actually my husband rented this and he would probably give it a 4.  It really is pretty good if you like all that martial art, gymnastics, fake blood spurts and super human feat sort of stuff.  At least there was a story line. But Russell Crowe?  C'mon folks.  He was so NOT meant for that part.  But I watched it with my husband anyway and had to remind him that when someone dies from having there head cut off, the blood doesn't shoot out like a power hose all over a room cause the heart stops beating.  He didn't really care though.  So, for a guy flick it is a 4 and the women are beautiful which helps I'm sure.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is cleverly written, very well performed by true professionals and set in gracious and beautiful surroundings.  Most of all it is an excellent portrayal of a period of history in which great social change was occurring and the effect it had on those who lived it,
B00881VLCE|2.0|This is a rather simple puzzle app.  The free puzzles are not interesting.  Would have loved to seen a better selection.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This was an impulse purchase...the other three &#34;Angry Birds&#34; games having completely entertained me...and, as fun as it is, it's not nearly as clever as the others.  Don't get me wrong,  I enjoy it but, again, it seems forced.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Have a Kindle Fire and this app has proven very handy in getting other apps that are needed to run certain programs.
B00459GJUM|5.0|I would have like to see season 3 but as with FireFly the SGU producers are smarter than their viewers; of course they are.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a very handy app for the traveler.  The display is bright, big and easy to read.  I liked this one.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Truly amazing story about a beautiful man. If you are not moved by this true story, you do not have a pulse.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|For all of the people who found this movie boring: please go & seek more depth for your souls. This movie is not about a plane crash. Just sit back & think about it: If the entire movie LITERALLY centered around the plane crash, then it only would have lasted for maybe 20 minutes...if that long. Plane crashes, in reality, only last for a few minutes, and that depends on the severity of the crash itself. This movie is about addictions, taking responsibility & appreciation. It's a movie that most of us can relate to because either we've had or someone we know has had some sort of addiction. 9 times out of 10, that person, or even US-are sometimes in denial about it, and it takes drastic measures for us to snap out of that addictive spell that's over us so that we CAN straighten up & fly right. As always, Denzel Washington delivered an epic performance. John Goodman? Hilarious!!<br /><br />For the &#34;nay-sayers&#34;: Please open your minds & look beyond what &#34;wasn't&#34; of the plane crash. Only then will you understand & really appreciate the movie.<br /><br />This is a movie I will happily watch again!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book is filled with excitement and adventure.  I loved it!!! I relate to the main character who is physically and mentally strong.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I LOVE Downton Abbey.  It is well written and the charactors are fascinating.  I have been telling all my friends about it and getting them hooked as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever. It has everything. It is emotional, action, romance, and more. I'm just waiting for the movie to come out.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|It was not a lot of action in this movie.  The movie lacked the advance technology that I am used to seeing in prior James Bond movies.  The movie was also hard to follow.
1439181780|3.0|I like the Secret better this was more of a repeat of the first book alot of the same comments over and over again
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|I played this before on my dads ipad but it was like free on there but hrs is like $2 and I think that's a lot but yea I like it but its just he price!! oh and team mustache :3
1582701709|5.0|I loved this book it has helped have a new out look on life it is easy to follow and read.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|I attached this right to the side of my camera housing and snapped it on easily while underwater. This was the best priced filter too- good product for the money~!
B000VKW7AK|5.0|it has every song and more, I love the DVD takes me back to the early 90-s. if you love megadeath it's a must have !
B000UNYJV8|4.0|THIS IS ENGLAND makes up for its relative uneventfulness with immediate realism, truly fine acting, and well-developed characters. Young Thomas Turgoose's performance is simply out of this world! As stated, it's not the most uplifting film you're likely to see, but it does have its funny and/or poignant moments. The view it affords of racial intolerance and anti-immigration sentiments in England during the 1980s remains quite pertinent today. THIS IS ENGLAND also includes a balanced and believable expos&eacute; of the punk and skinhead movements and the motivations behind them. The Special Features, particularly the Deleted Scenes and Alternate Ending, are definitely worth a look. The heavy north English brogues are a bit hard to understand sometimes, but the subtitles should help here.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This does not involve murder, blood, car chase, guns, and revenge which appear to be necessary tools to some writers.<br />This is a story of the daughter-father relationships, career choice, internal struggle and what makes one happy. It is a quiet story, and it  isalso a story of “living high road”.
B007IK44CK|4.0|I was entertained for 2 hours, but I won't be adding it to my permanent collection.  Tom cruise is still a good actor even if a bit crazy.
B008J05EL8|2.0|I haven't been able to use it. I can't get it to do anything so I really can't honestly give an opinion.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|This show was trying to be like Downton Abbey but in a newer timeline. It had some good things like the characters were fair but the storyline was definately missing something to keep you watching. Just needs a few more tweeks and maybe this could be a good one.
B008XG1X18|4.0|It took a while for me to figure out how to see other people's pins.  You have to hit the back arrow and then flick the page with your finger.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|The writers on this show did so well with depicting the outfits and standards as to how the royals lived. Henry was such a sleeze but you keep telling yourself that its ok, he's allowed to do that. He's royal! The sets and characters are stellar and pull you through each scene. The storyline keeps you watching by keeping you guesssing who is going to backstab who in the royal kingdom. Love this show.
B006MQRLSA|2.0|it was just okay.  Brad Pitt did a fair job.  It was the story that was - just okay.  Just okay.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a very violent and suductive show depicting a motorcycle gang and their business. I find myself always routing for the gang as they murder, harass yet protect their small town of Charming. The characters are well written and each has their own story that you can keep up with. It is amazing how the town hates the gang yet run to them when they need help for something. This show makes me want to stay up all night watching all episodes. Be careful, it's a VERY addicting show. Best one out there!!
0316017930|5.0|i have bought this book for many of my friends.  Very insightful reading.  i did read his other book and didn't enjoy them......but, &#34;Outliers: the Story of Success&#34;  is great!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Overall, these videos loaded quickly and with great quality. It is worth purchasing to have the better quality. I wouldn't change a thing!
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This is so cool it could be like a fight over a burger on sale.This is a cool cool game and so as oh it could be like this 2 people rushing to go on a full flight.You need 2 buy this APP it's like woo legendary! Please get this app.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app! It is helpful and easy to use. It even has the current weather at the top, which is the first thing I wonder when I wake up. And it's free!
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|my grandaughter loves this movie.  Every time she comes to spend the night, we watch it more than one time.
1427210241|5.0|This was the final book in this series and my husband was so delighted with the final book. Shipped right on time as the order said it would.
0817439390|5.0|This book helped me understand my camera and what it can do.  I'm new to photography and before this book I would just point and shoot in auto.  But I wanted to start learning more about manual and being in charge of the settings.  Bryan's example pictures really help explain the text and the point he is trying to make.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|A real action movie--- non stop<br />It keeps you on the edge of your seat thoughout the movie<br />Whatched it twice
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I did not open the box. This was a gift and was told by my sister that the product worked great and that the movie was very good.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Not as good as her &#34;Gone GIrl&#34; but worth reading.  GIllian Flynn reminds me of Stephan King in some ways, without the supernatural aspect. Her character and town descriptions are a bit creepy..
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great app gives me something to do while I'm waiting at the airport. Easy to use and fun. pop up ads can be annoying why I gave a 4 instead of a 5
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a masterful series, wrapped in humor, mystery, drama and the beauty of the countryside.  It also reveals relationships and the stress of perceived class superiority of that day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should get this app and trust me you wont retreat it.its the beast app ever.I love it.so many things to do.Dutch a great game love it. Its. Idicding soooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|These books had so much hype around them that I had to try it out. Unfortunately, I was unable to even find a way to connect with Katniss' character at all because she's simply boring. No unpredictability, just another heroine with skills above the rest. It may very well prove to be an exciting story to the younger generation, but it just reads like so many other books before it that it lacks that spark.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just wish the seasons were longer, it like a new friend you enjoy spending time with and never want it to end.
B007SGM084|4.0|Very enjoyable in a cotton-candy, bubblegum way: not going to go down in the annals of classic literature, but a great escape from your average \\"life of quiet desperation.\\" \\"Mommy porn\\" perhaps, but I enjoyed it!
B001FVV2X2|4.0|If you take part of the X-Files, ramp it up right to the edge of believability, and add a dash of mad scientist, then there you have it.  You just have to remember that this is pseudo-science so you can sit back and enjoy it.  They only thing I don't like about it is their tendency to throw in a bit of gore...could have done without that and not affected the story line.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book! It showed many  different admonishes sad, happy, funny, and anger.<br />This book is the kind of book I would recommend to my mom or dad and maybe even my brother and sister.  ;D.
B00684J49U|5.0|I have all the seasons which I enjoy watching when I have time.  It is a very good show I enjoy the characters on the show.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie really was worth the Oscar.  Even when you knew what the outcome of the story was, it keeps you interested and at the edge of your seat.  Well done!
B00797MB0O|1.0|Very slow, very boring, and over all waste of time! Shocked Charlize Theron signed on to this crappy movie, it sucked!
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a pretty good series.  I will attempt to keep on following the episodes.  The character developement is excellent.
142314189X|5.0|A gift for a granddaughter who loves this writer.  She really liked it and I liked the fact that it was a set.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Josh's voice in this album is wonderful.  The &#34;I Believe&#34; song is my favorite.  Great gift for a loved one.
1423113497|5.0|Another great set for a great price and a great way to start my granddaughter out on a good adventure to reading.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  There is an erotic side to this book, but there is still a plot, This book is the perfect escape for most of us.  It offers beautiful people who never have to worry about money, which we all aspire to be.  It also offers excitement with a little risk in and out of the erotic scenes.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|I have seen this classic film several times and it never grows old.  The actors are all wonderful and I especially love the little sister, who likes to cause trouble behind the scenes throughout.  Who wouldn't love to see Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart all three together in a film.  They are all at their best, as they work their way through this wonderful film.<br /><br />But what was brand new for me and I absolutely loved, was the fact that I did it by streaming through Amazon.coms instant streaming program.  I'd never done streaming through anybody or anything before, yet it was actually quite easy to do.  And while I did end up having a couple of questions, when I spoke with their Customer Services Representative, she answered them and was just great.  So, if anyone else is out there and uncertain as to all of this new technology, like me, don't be afraid to check it out.  It truly was very simple and so worth the little effort I put into it.
B0035LGXXO|5.0|This movie is a definite classic. The characters and the lines they speak can be remembered for years after seeing this movie. Great soundtrack and cinematography.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This product is perfect, however, I didn't need it. I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite and thought I read it didn't come with this. BUT... it's the power adaptor it doesnt come with. Oh well, at $10.... you can never have enough chargers. I will just keep this one at work.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Of course, it won best picture so you know it's excellent.  I loved the acting and the characters were really well developed.  I actually thought Les Mis should have won best picture but this one is excellent.  Watch it!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Fat Amy is my favorite part, hands down! It is a must see in my book. Watch it tongiht! You will love it too!
B001XUIBNO|3.0|Although it moved a bit slow at times it's complexity made it interesting in the end.  The title is a bit deceiving.
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|Another fine product of the Star Trek franchise.  Humor, excitement, drama, yeah, gun fights too!!  Love it.<br /><br />Cannot miss it.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|It was a little wordy and drug out. Good story but not a must read. Too many graphic gory details.
B003U4ZQUM|4.0|Was a great series! Could not stop watching. Very suspenseful and couldn't wait to see what happened next. Suggest you watch!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This show is quite addicting and we worth your time to experience.  It can be somewhat gory but the drama is first rate.
B00459EZLW|5.0|I loved this show. I wish there where more seasons!!! I just wish it had a better ending. Other then that I would watch it again!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Es un Seiko eso lo dice todo. Excelente reloj automatico, muy bonito y de gran calidad. No creo que exista un reloj con una mejor relacion costo calidad.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The minute I started watching this series I absolutely fell in love with it.  An excellent series to watch and can't wait for season 4.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this book is absolutely amazing.. the end leaves you wanting more then ever! Not one time was  I not on the edge of my seat waiting to read what happened next.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The minute I started watching this series I absolutely fell in love with it.  An excellent series to watch and can't wait for season 4.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|This type of book is so predictable. boy falls for girl, girl doesn't want boy, oh wait! Yea she does! And how demanding the male love interest acts, I'm surprised how we're supposed to root for him anyway. Pure disappointment.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|A great application, and it was free!  There are plenty of selections to choose from, and they all sound great.
B005OKTPKC|1.0|This book is like a bigmac. You were hungry and you thought it would sustain you but afterwards you feel a little cheap and cheated and you wonder why you bothered.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|It was a great experience, I really like the idea of going back to the movie scene at any time. I recommend anybody to watch movies from Amazon.
B004KPHQR6|1.0|This is a lousy movie with bad plots.  The special effect is very poor even for its time. It is worse than the movies from colledge kids
B007QB5BPA|5.0|The book is very well put together. I like it because it's about someone real and how they got to where they are now in life. I'm interested in the snipers, because of all the training they have to go through in order to be the best of the best.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|This movie was excellent, not one moment of boredom.  And yet, a good history lesson.  I highly recommend watching.  Ben Affleck should have been Best Actor.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it. It was so easy to purchase and love how easy it was to download on kindle. Great purchase!
159420411X|5.0|This is a (mostly) fun read which enhances true understanding. Silver is not only a brilliant thinker, he communicates very well and presents all kinds of interesting and surprising pieces of information.  Still, I found some chapters much more interesting than others.  The pages on Silver's sports model, poker and chess may be skipped - unless you are a poker player. On the other hand, Silver's chapter on climate change is more objective, clear and informative than anything else I have read on the subject, and his chapters on weather forecasting and Bayes theorem are exceptional.  Unfortunately, the chapter headings give only indirect hints as to chapter content.<br /><br /> Silver has several themes.  Forecasters tend to be overconfident, particularly when they are not getting a lot of feedback on their accuracy, or like political pundits, they rely on their memory as to how good a forecaster they are.  Contributing to overconfidence in some areas of study is the over fitting of models - if you incorporate enough variables, you can make your model look very good in hindsight, only to find it does not work very well when used to make new forecasts.  Alternatively, if you can try enough different variables in the search for significance, at least some will look good, again in hindsight: if you try 100 different variables, each with only a 5 % chance of generating a false positive, then 5 of the 100 will be found to be \\"significant\\" by pure chance.<br /><br /> I was familiar with Bayes theorem, but gained a whole new appreciation of it thanks to Silver, even while he avoids  complexity.  For those readers interested, the algebraic formula for posterior probability (p. 245), as applied to the cheating example, represents the probability of BOTH the partner cheating and stranger underwear in the drawer, divided by the probability of stranger underwear whatever the cause.  Bayes theorem employs an estimate of the probability something is true before analyzing relevant data.  It fits in with Silver's point that hypothesis should make sense rather than based on data alone.  When the initial probability is based on statistics, e.g. the per cent of women in their 40's who develop breast cancer, the theorem becomes more powerful and less controversial.<br /><br /> As interesting as the chapter on weather forecasting was, I think Silver was unintentionally misleading.  As a physicist friend told me, scientists still cannot adequately model such phenomenon as air turbulence.  Conversely, when relying on history rather than a weather model to make a  forecast, the forecasters can distinguish the average weather depending on such factors as the strength of an El nino or La Nina Pacific Ocean phenomenon (Silver clearly knows this).  It is remarkable that the forecasters can add value to short term forecasts by adjusting, subjectively, even the best computer models we have, as demonstrated by records which the National Weather Service keeps.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works great on my android phone! No need to buy an actual Kindle when the phone does it as well!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|i choose this rating  because the story kept me rivited to my seat i thought for sure that tiger would get pi in the end , but that didnt happen  pi was sure going to at least try to tame his friend to a degree  , and the ending was phenomanol.<br />i would recommend this movie to everyone  it was very touching , and caring  and like i said i was glued to my seat untill the very end , its like a good book you just cant put it down
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It was funny, witty, and down right amazing! Ever need something to cheer you up, watch pitch perfect and you'll be good to go.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderfully realized period piece with great attention to the changing fashions and mores of Britsh society around World War I.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's written well and I'm glad to have a conclusion but it was kinda depressing. I think I would have been fine stopping after the first book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|well I don't know how to put this delicately but..... its the best flippin' game in the whole universe!!!!!! buy it seriously get your butt off your coach and GET IT!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Surprisingly, child hunting is entertaining (it's just a book, it's not real people). I looked forward to reading it every evening. Caused me to go to bed late on several occasions.
B005HED11Y|4.0|The picture is clean, but the sound, especially in the opening &#34;Space the final frontier....&#34;  is very week and not at the same level as the rest of the shows.  Unfortunately, it is the same on every show of the season.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. Although it's not excellent writing & has a lot of of repeat phrases, it's still very entertaining. I could hardly wait to start Book Three. I want a Book Four, Five Six etc.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I really enjoyed the 1st season, But am a little peeved at Amazon Prime that they want to charge 22.00 for season #2. Maybe smart marketing on there part, But I probably will not be renewing my prime because amazon uses this little Gotcha Gimmick all the time.
0062082353|5.0|Great book! Real life stories and a book Chris Kyle wrote himself. I recommend this book to anyone who likes war stories.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I love this game. I hope they come out with a 2nd. I highly recommend this game. I'm a big fan of Biggish games.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Bought this for myself and have yet to solve it. It sits on my desk at work and all my coworkers try to solve but just end up swearing at it.  Mine was received in perfect condition no loose parts and has been pretty abused and is still holding up well.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It has been awhile since I have read anything by Stephen King but he did not disappoint. There are no real monsters featured in this story so I could read it while alone, and at night, without having to jump at small sounds or look over my shoulder all the time. As one that sometimes wonders what it would be like to go back in time it was interesting to read of what it might be like to do so. I knew that things could change the future but never realized how much they could change it. I was just 8 years old when JFK was killed and although I remember that time I saw it through a child's eyes. It was nice to have another view of that time.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I really like this game.  I've only had it for two days and have spent many hours playing it.  It's hard but not so hard that you get discouraged.
B003VW54QO|4.0|Good casting.  Great to see some of the youngsters in their beginning.  Movie quality was good and even though I was having a little trouble with my cable, I kept going back to the movie.  Had to see how it ended.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|An interesting twist on a movie classic.  Frankenweenie is a fun animated movie for all ages.  ANother great movie from TIm Burton.
B0097BO21G|3.0|Celine is always a great voice to listen to.  This wasn't the CD I thought I was buying but it was alright.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|There's not much on TV for me these days, and I didn't begin watching this series on TV. I didn't even know about it, but I was looking on Amazon for a series with which to fill my winter hours and decided to give this one a try, not feeling very hopeful that it would capture my interest. But it did immediately. It has something so much of today's programming misses, it immediately drew me in with well-rounded characters whose lives I care about, and it's intelligent viewing. That's it, simple enough ingredients sadly lacking in all the flash, bang, whiz, boom filling up our hundreds of TV channels.<br />I'm well into the fourth season now. Seasons 2 & 3 are my favorites, but the first season sets up all the premises for future episodes. Season four seems to lose focus now and then, but once I got that far, I wasn't stopping because I cared about what happened to the characters and their unlikely worlds. If the series were to be picked up and resumed, I would have my DVR set so I wouldn't miss another episode. Thanks, Amazon.com, for making it possible for me to enjoy this unique series.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|A few twists in the book that go beyond the show. While not a edge-of-seat page-turner, I enjoyed this one.
B00796E7CA|5.0|For anyone who wants to know more information about Middle-Earth than The Lord of the Rings series provided.  A chronicle of the language, customs and stories of Middle-Earth.
B00124DQZO|5.0|The guitar solo on 25 or 6 to 4 is worth the price. They sound more confident and looser than when they are at carnegie hall.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|A great read.  Although the story line can be irritating and somewhat simplistic the historical aspect was tremendous.  We learned so much more about the 2nd World War
B00A8307BG|5.0|Different from any previous Trower releases. Blues, the way RT sees the Blues with his own guitar and his own singing. Most of the tracks are simply rock, some are a blend; bottom line it is a Robin Trower's signature on every song. No computers and no technology. classic Rock and blues album. 4 stars for the new fans. 5 for me, similar to most of his previous releases, and I own them ALL ))). very Recommended
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Of course I wanted to know how it would end, but it seemed a bit much to take in. My favorite was Suzanne's first book. The ending was good. It reminded me of &#34;Candide&#34;.<br />Christine C.May
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Overall very interesting, but a little unbelievable.I don't think any pilot could do what he did in that movie.<br />John Goodman  was very good.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book tugged my heart in a way that I wasn't familiar with! Truly a magical love story of how love makes anything possible. Nicholas Sparks succeeds again fans!
1400063515|1.0|And why black swans?  They are not particularly rare - Australia has loads of them and very nice they are...
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is fun I honestly love it this is the only game I play  I give it an A+
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I bought this book, just aftering hearing that Chris was killed back here in the states.<br />Seemed like such an unfair turn for he and his family.  If you like war stories, you would like the book.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It holds you're attention.  Makes you keep playing and coming back for more.  I would recommend it for all age groups.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really enjoyed the first season of Fringe. It really kept me entertained throughout the whole season with laughs, cheers, an even jeers. No show is absolutely perfect as everyone's opinion on perfect is skewed to their point of view. It does exactly what I wanted it to do, entertain me for the 40+ min that it takes to complete one show.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It has up dated to 6.1 and added armor,stone cutter and neither rack<br />it's awesome and has more resources .
B00B2LPYNE|5.0|This is a fantastic album. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of heavy metal. Every song is excellent, and the whole thing motivates you and makes you feel like you can accomplish anything.
B00BHMF578|5.0|How Ben Affleck manages to make a decades old event so suspenseful and intriguing is beyond me, but he does. Done in a very understated manner, without unnecessary special effects or violence, Argo is an entertaining, yet thoughtful rendition of an almost forgotten era of modern US history. The film is not preachy and manages to leave politics out of this story of US citizens who escaped from the embassy in the nick of time and the CIA operative who gets them out of Iran before they are discovered.
B0063GORYU|5.0|enjoy the product for stimulating the mind to keep an aging brain active.  Love Words with Friends and Scramble .
1594744769|5.0|When I first looked at this book, I thought that it was going to be a scary thriller kind of a read. But it was a pleasant surprise that it was all about overcoming fear, and finding yourself. I was so in love with this book, that I read it in a matter of hours. The book does not only show off the beautiful words of the author, but also uses pictures to describe the story, which made the book a lot more unique. This books is all about a teenager named Jacob who's grandfather has recently passed. His last words were to \\"find the bird in the loop\\", etc. This sends Jacob on a spontaneous adventure to a small island off the coast of Wales. What he finds is truly shocking, and it might even make you, the reader, think differently about life itself. I recommend this book to anyone who is into the supernatural!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|haven't used it yet but looking forward to it since I love Words with Friends and Scramble to continue to stimulate the aging mind
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|This could have been a much better movie without the constant use of the &#34;F&#34; word and opening with a completely naked female paraded in front of the camera. The good portrayal of addiction and accompanying denial was the redeeming part of this movie. Overall, I am sorry that I spent money to see this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love the game to continue to keep the aging mind sharp.  Especially love Words with Friends and Scramble for that purpose.
B002SJ2ZTK|5.0|This is a 1935 Hitchcock film that is one of my favorites. I love the chemistry between Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll. If you compare this film to North by Northwest (a Hitchcock film made in the late 1950s), it's interesting to note the changes in Hitchcock's style and film making as a whole, although the plots are incredibly similar.<br /><br />This film isn't for everyone. It is in black and white. It is a cat and mouse thriller, but don't expect Jason Bourne-like action. Film making wasn't anywhere near those effects or violence in the 1930s.<br /><br />If you're a lover of classic cinema, Hitchcock films in particular, then you don't want to miss this 1930s thriller.<br /><br />A later note ...<br />I have to add that Robert Donat was a hot babe in his day. He's all but forgotten today; he died at a fairly young age. His life was plagued with illness that might have kept him from becoming a major star. The scenes from 39 Steps in which he is handcuffed to Madeleine Carroll and he tells her about his &#34;life of crime&#34; are quite charming and funny.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|haven't used yet but my daughter loves it.  I love Words with Friends and Scramble to keep the aging mind stimulated.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The best. movie I have seen in a very long time. This one goes in my library!  The casting was exceptional to real life. Ben was phenomenal.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I think this is a very entertaining series.I'm glad Bones and Booth finally realized their feelings for each other.Most favorite show!!!!
B000IDEORY|5.0|Loved this movie when I first saw it and love it every time I watch it!  Definitely one of the classics!
B0095P33IW|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Great start to the Avengers series when you watch them in order with the other movies.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I watched this two days ago and am still thinking about it. Well done and what a terrific story. Sixto Rodriguez is quite an interesting person.
B00821OX98|4.0|I would recomend this to SciFi fans and enthusiasts.  The casting is well done and the story line so far is well thought out.
B002XWXPC8|3.0|Still very funny. Randy Newman sountrack, great comic performances and some pretty funny observations. Tom Berenger's character only gets weak when he's chasing the girl.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Omg, great book.  Didn't want to put it down.  So many twist all the way to the end.  A must read!
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was great. It gets you really involved in to Charlie's-the main characters-life. It makes you think of your own high school experiences. It's relatable no matter who you were in high school. It's a story about growing up and discovering love, friendship and drugs. The end will surprise you because you don't see something like that coming.  Emma Watson was great in this film. You can no longer think of her as Hermione from Harry Potter. All in all, best money I ever spent.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This movie is a waste of time. Unecessary sex scenes...Not much interest at all. One interesting scene and that was the actual problem with flight.<br />Then he &#34;lands&#34; a plane that he flies upside down? REALLY NOW.. I am tired of movies with sex in them and nudity. If I try to watch a movie at home and have kids or friends over I have to shut it off.. and it bothers ME to have to sit thru it .<br />Producers should make better movies. Now a days they all seem like a 14 year old BOY made the movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i love this book the other were awesome to i wuold defintley reommend this book to other its a great triology!
B008NABUU8|5.0|this is so so so so so so so so so so so so  so so grate I love it
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This app would not download on my phone.  Told amazon about it and they never contacted me or send a game that would work
B000XKZQ74|5.0|I cannot add much to recommend the film beyond what has been stated in the other reviews, but just wanted to note the literary qualities of the Wiesler character. He is the invisible man who chooses to remain invisible but through the course of his work reaches the point of a moral shift. Once headed to the top of Staziland, he sacrifices this to provide protection to his moral superior. AND he chooses to remain invisible, the only life he knows. As such he is the true artist, the real voyeur and playwrite, in the story. The victim of spying at the end is splashed across bookstores in a huge graphic posters while the artist who kept him alive remains an invisible postal worker. This is the perfect portrait of the artist as an invisible man.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 1 and 2 1/2 yr old love this game and it helps them learn!! They really love popping the balloons!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This case is great for the Kindle Fire. It's strudy and nice looking at the same time. Love the handle too.
1439190275|5.0|it has all of the information you need about the  Atkins Diet program<br />it is easy to read<br />i love the way this diet helps me with my carbs low!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel is intriguing and held my attention throughout. The characters are well developed, and deep. The only reason I did not give five stars is that I was disconcerted by the ending.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|app was cute, but when i was done, i found i could not log out... had to re-start my kindle...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this period saga.  The characters are very believable and very period accurate. I truly cannot wait until next season!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This series is one of my all-time favorites! It has it all. Better than The X-Files and Outer Limits combined, IMO. I was sorry to see it canceled. Highly recommend.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I enjoy cubistry.  I enjoy looking for matching pairs.  Nice Colors and the designes are interesting. I enjoy this game..
B00992CF6W|5.0|now i can play mine craft on road trips, whoot whoot! i never stop playing this game! GET IT NOW!!!
B000I186FW|4.0|Dark, deep, interesting much deeper than the the average graphic novel adaption, violent, but never dull, interesting plot and characters.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|it's ok, the app only lets you play for about 20 min. before it tells you to buy the app to continue. :'( overall it's not the best just speend $6 and get the real mc pocket edition.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This collection is great, especially for the price.<br />I wish it included a Standard Definition disc for each movie as well, which is usually standard for most Blu-ray movies.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this series!  most of the time I think Hollywood is filled with people just copying each other.  one storage show works out so lets make five more spin offs!  its obnoxious.  This show in my opinion, set in motion all of these movies and shows coming out with fairytale spin offs.  It is a fantastic marriage between the real world and the stories we grew up with.  its original entertaining and twisted.  the characters are wonderfully cast and each episode keeps me guessing how they are gonna get to the next.  check out season one first for sure!
1616550414|4.0|I preordered this and recieved it the day before it was supposed to come out. Tons of art and story lines from different zelda games.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Great book! The book was amazing! It took me a longer than it usually takes me to read a book tho.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|The author's use of imagery is fantastic, and she clearly excels in this area. I'm sure she did quite well in her high school writing classes. However, I was annoyed with all the run on sentences. Further, I could never really figure out how Marco and Celia were competing with each other. Also, It took three fourths of the book to figure out the characters and their relationship to each other. I'd say don't invest your time in this one.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|The first year is the best. Interesting twists and turns of British politics. Shows a little political bias. Following years become a little more predictable.
0007444397|5.0|This book is a very nicely made book.  I was sad to see that some of the photos were not &#34;elementary school&#34; material.... a bit more sexy than I had hoped but a great choice for someone who is looking for that type of book.
B008Q08EV8|3.0|As with a lot of these types of movies they are written as 21st century people with 21st century values cast back into roman times. That's ok for this movie. Its interested and has a reasonable plot. If you are looking for Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, this isn't it.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Worst Bond movie ever. Not only that, almost every site has given minimum 4 stars to this predictable movie with banal scenes around the world.  And Mr. Bond has indeed gotten older.
B00B5HQL50|4.0|I like Daniel Craig as bond. In fact, he's my favorite since Sean Connery. Through backs to original series are cute. The Chinese angle is not as developed as I'd hoped.  Didn't like the outcome in the ending. We will see if that takes us in a better direction in the future. I like the subtle ship references with Q and on the wall at the end.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|crazy, cute and just plain fun. Helped me learn to use the Kindle, Very colorful and good for all ages.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|A little too much wise cracking for most of the story and not quite enough plot .  But the last third of the book was compelling.  All in all a fun read.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Did not like how its set up. Too brief of ads. This is my personal opinion. Some may like it.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I bought this movie for the family and I love how it's a FAMILY  movie- like they used to be.  It's entertaining enough for adults and great for children.  I wish they had more movies like this available.
0316232955|5.0|Purchased for my 12 year old daughter who is a huge Glee fan.  She devoured this book, it is well written and for the most part, age appropriate.  There is some adult content but it is not at all graphic, and for the most part, implied. if your child watches Glee, the book is much more tame.  I also recommend Chris Colfer's other book, Land of Stories.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is the best game in the world.It is a must have soon.The main reason I'm making a review is because you get 3 free gems!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks books are always good, you can't go wrong.  I couldn't put this one down in the last few chapters.
1423140591|5.0|This book was purchased for my grandson, who is a huge fan or Rick Riordans books. He began with Percy Jackson and the lightning thief and has read all in that series. I love that he reads.
B001XUIBNO|4.0|It had very Good acting. It had an interesting and it was well directed. Great production values and editing. Positive.
142311339X|5.0|This also was a gift to my grandson. He is a huge fan of the Percy Jackson series. He has read all of them. He now is reading this series. See comment for book 2 for more
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The movie was great.  I sat on the edge of my seat the whole time.  It was hard to believe that it actually happened in real life.
B00ANY94A0|4.0|Our 5 year old daughter loves Lego Friends. She first saw them at a friends house and was instantly obsessed with them. We purchased a set for Christmas and it was a big hit. We got this little set for her to expand her collection and she loves it.<br /><br />The LEGO Friends Squirrel's Tree House Set is one of those tiny sets in a little hanging bag with only 41 pieces. It includes a Squirrel figure, a small treehouse and a bowl of acorns. The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow for a 5 year old. The recommended age is 5-12 and a 5 year old will only need minimal help with it.<br /><br />Obviously this is a very small set that you usually find on an end cap at your local store hanging on a hook. The MSRP on the LEGO web site for this set is $4.99. If a set isn't Retired, you shouldn't have to pay much more than the MSRP which is usually the going rate from WalMart, Target and the LEGO web site. Some Secondary Amazon Merchants sell this set for much more which is in no way worth it. You pay more per piece for these little sets, but for $10 you can easily find 80-100 piece LEGO Friends sets. This size set should be purchased at your local store if you can find it. If you can't find it elsewhere and Amazon is your only option, please be sure you know what you are getting in this small set. Make sure to shop around.<br /><br />Long story short, this is a nice addition to your LEGO Friends collection if you can find it for around $5, and it would make for a nice stocking stuffer.<br /><br />=========================<br /><br />UPDATE: This set is currently marked as RETIRING SOON on the LEGO web site. If you want this set, now is the time to buy it before it becomes harder to find and more expensive. Make sure to shop around for the best price.

B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I love the Bond series and think Daniel Craig fills the shoes nicely, but Skyfall just didn't do it for me. The plot felt forced and drawn out. The martini was definitely stirred in this one...
B0000542DJ|4.0|Saw this on the History channel.  Have wanted it since.  Excellent movie.  All about JFK.  If you like history I would recommend this item.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Amazing story plot with extremely detailed character development throughout the book.  I couldn't put it down from start to finish.
B0037FFBCW|5.0|Classic movie.  I couldn't wait to actually see this one.  I loved it.  Excellent older movie.  Disfigured man trying to fit in.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|It was extremely good and did hole my interest.  Please write more!!!<br /><br />I am passing it along to one of my friends.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Love this app but it does not even load in my kindle. It takes for ever to load and once it is done loading it crashes. Very dissapointed. I will have to settle for playing it on my phone.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|Kids loved it minus a couple of scenes when Dracula's eyes were glowing red and the big fangs came out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great place to find good recipes, good crafting ideas, and lots of other stuff.  I enjoy browsing through all the different categories, and following my friends boards to see what they are looking at too.  It's a great way to spend some time.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Every so often a novel comes along and actually makes you realize love is rarely a fairytale. Love is found in the most peculiar places and usually when your looking the other way.<br /><br />This book doesn't pretend to make life out to be anything other than what it is.....hard.  it doesn't matter how positive you are about life's situation sometimes bad things happen but you have to move forward and keep living, not just existing but living. But hopefully there is someone that understands how messy things are and if your lucky they may even help clean up after life's mistakes.<br /><br />This book reminded me I am lucky enough to have someone I love, love me back and be there when life gets too messy to clean up alone!
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is an older game so it is fun. My grandson loves playing it.  Kinda confusing at first but ok
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard about this show from some friends, so when Amazon Prime offered one month of free streaming, I decided to check it out.  I find it really facinating to observe life in that era...the interactions, the hierarchy, the bonding, and best of all how very well Grandmama says the most pointed statements in the most gracious way.  She has all of the best lines!  My only disappointment was to find out after watching Seasons 1 and 2 for free through Amazon Prime, I had to pay for Season 3.  By that time I was addicted, so I just had to spend the money.  I stayed up until 4 am just to finish Season 3 and find out what happened at the end.  Can't wait until Season 4 starts!!  Bloody well done!
1250006341|5.0|Explains the characters and the players. One of my favorite BBC shows,Right up there with Upstairs, Downstairs- the original.<br />Congratulations to PBS for bringing the best of the BBC to the USA.
B0090CMMIC|2.0|And they all sound like Nickleback. Thumbs down. I guess they're trying to play metal all while still appealing to the future country western fans.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Superb writing, acting, costume. Really something is happening in every single episode, a lot of painstaking research went into such a finely produced show. I wont lie the ending to season three has me baffled, really am hoping that their is some better take off to the beginning of season four. The characters are rich and I'm referring to monetary compensation, they are very vivid and have great interaction one with another. I'm truly addicted. I would highly recommend the show to anyone who has a love for History, or just enjoys a good storyline and one that flows well and isn't tacky, a nice break from all the reality unscripted blither that is so common now.
B00AY0A71I|4.0|I enjoyed it the first time and liked it almost as much 20 years later. Kevin Kline is perfect as the nutcase bad guy.
B00966TN1Q|2.0|The headline says it all. Mr. Connolly seems to be pumping them out for the money and not for the love. Very disappointing after dozens of great Harry Bosch novels
B006VFLIYK|4.0|good story well told. compelling characters and a complicated, but cogent plot. and a new character (to me at least) who I like and hope to see more of.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A must read for every arcade player, pc or console gamer<br />and all around sci-fi and fantasy geek worth his or her salt.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love this series, good from the very start. HD episodes make it crystal clear. Casting is amazing and the storyline are (mostly) believable.
B0086449YA|4.0|Mark Knopfler is a veritable genius. Thus, it pains me to report that I do not personally like this double CD as much as I have practically worshiped his other work. There is just too much blues in this for me. Now the musicianship is flawless in Privateering. The perfectionism that MK brings to his craft is inimitable. I tried to play like MK once, but I had to put the guitar down. I mean these songs work as a Mark Knopfler song is wont, to transform, to mesmerize and to hypnotically take me to a place and time. Still, when I take my picks from this double CD, they are the non-blues ones. I like Mark Knopfler when he transfixes in a country/folk/rock state of mind. These are here, but not enough of them for me.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|obsessed with the tudors after the first two episodes very well written and wonderful acting it really makes you feel like you are watching history in the making
B0074YVW1G|4.0|Very easy to read and has a wealth of information regarding the intorverts of this world and how they operate and have succeded in life.<br />I would highly recommend it to both introverts and extroverts for an understanding of how each other operates.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Goodn:jjjjjjjjjjjjjjj: Www no nO sEe nO sEe nO sEe nO DR no sEe KimI DEe KooP SEe nO Www nO Www nO Www KimI Www KimI Www nO sEe nO Www KimI Www KimI rE I Www looP sEe KimI sEe KimI Www nO E KimI Www nO Www KimI Www lO Www lO Www I Www looP Www
B002W1UEW4|3.0|Pretty decent movie.  It has a so-so plot.  The action sequences are pretty cool, but the filler lacks a little.
B000002BYA|5.0|I have been playing guitar for a long time, so Steve is one of my heroes. Great classic blues by Steve and Double Trouble combo. thank you
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is such a great game. It is totally addictive and easy to play. My five year nephew even loves to play all the time. I recommend this game to everyone young and old.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So much fun and It' so hard to put down.  i can't believe I got it for free.  i'm obsessed!
B0083GQKQG|1.0|Actors played as best they could but the plot was all over the board - IMO it was a wasted evening!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I've read hundreds of SF novels in my life.  Most are OK. Some are great. None were funny.  This self-published book manages to be both great, and funny.  The marooned astronaut, despite his dire  situation, is the most wise-assed, yet intelligent, character I've ever had the pleasure to know. I look forward to more by Andy Weir.
B008Y6TD5A|5.0|Russell played a humble character but don't let that fool ya! He was awesome in this riveting nail biting movie!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this game but the free version doesn't give you many worlds I say if you really want this game get the full version
B003UBTX72|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much!  I learned a lot about Keith Richards, and his creative thinking and his memories of how each song came to be.  I now listen to the Rolling Stones with a bit more of &#34;an ear&#34; knowing the history behind some of the hits.
B0042QNP2S|5.0|I bought it for my son who loved the truck so im happy when he is happy. until soon bye bye
B0094K1QR8|1.0|This waste of time, effort, and money would arouse the critical instincts of a ten-year old and elicit appropriate eyebrow raising, frowns, and tongue-clicking.  Everybody involved with this ought to be ashamed.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|The book was incredible, but for some reason the movie was a million times better! Krisitn Scott Thomas was fabulous. I loved her talent that exuded from her and the story itself is historic and there are scenes that will never be forgotten. Have shared both book and movie with many of my friends and all have agreed on the quality of both being unforgettable.[[...]]
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Easy reading good story line keeps you reading. Looking forward to book two and see how she continues the story line
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Totally addicting adaptation of jane's beloved novel which I think rivals P&P for her #1 literary work! Will watch over and over and dream that my own Mr. Wentowrth may come to life and wisk me away on an oceanic voyage (less of battle voyage and more of a cruise ship atmosphere however lol). Splendid performances by supporting cast members, especially the performances of Anne's hypochondriac sister, quite well done! The Fifteen Houses: A Novel [...]
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best mini-series I have watch in many years. Always a new turn or twist to keep you interested. Can't wait for more episodes.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle is one of the most amazing singers of our time.  Calling her singing angelic is the only way to describe it!
1469220660|5.0|I just LOVE this series and cannot wait for book 3!!  The reader in the audio book is perfect and I throughly enjoyed this book! To me this was better than the 50 Shades Series as the love between the two main characters is incredible. It makes you feel like you are there and you dont want to stop reading or listening!<br /><br />Kudos Sylvia!!!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The blu-ray did enhance the viewing, it seemed the colours were sharper and crisp. Being a fan of Downton Abbey I will say I did see bits and pieces from the UK version I don't remember seeing when it aired on PBS. Those bits and pieces weren't as necessary (I think) as everyone else seems to think. They were short and scattered about so the sense of the plot was still easy to follow. Now I will purchase season three as I was very impressed with these two seasons.

006145205X|4.0|Matt Ridley wrote one of my all-time favorite books, 'Genome'. In this book he traces the evolution of the free market, and points out all the reasons to be optimistic, mainly technological improvements. His view of governments are that they are effectively parasitic organisations that waste the wealth of the people. I am not as optimistic as Mr. Ridley on any chance that we may in the future break the grip that professional politicians have built on their position in society. All in all, hwoever, this is a good read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read this book with a friend at work.  Everyday we would come to work, then talk about what the we read and what we thought was going to happen next.  I have not been reading books in a long time, due to kid and working.  This renewed my love for reading again.  I had another friend that did not read it, but when I got to work I would have to tell her everything that happened in the book.  I loved all three of the books in this series.  A must read.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I highly recommend this movie. Eye-opening. Companies so focused on bottom line with less regard for consumers and farmers. Will be looking for more sustainable produce from now on. You get what you pay for.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Must read.  What I enjoyed about the series is when I was done with the third book I did not have the feeling like I still wanted more.  Some books that I read I feel like I did not want it to end.  The ending just left you hanging there.  With this book I felt that the whole circle was complete.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Passes the time but not much else. Generic plot with better acting from secondary characters which isn't saying much for this
B004XGN8W4|5.0|My sons loves this product. I bought it for him for xmas.  I keep find it everywhere now that he can set it up anywhere in the house.
1568490119|4.0|Very educational. I learned a lot about the hardships that were during that period of history. I'm thankful that I lived through that period without such hardships.
B0086700CM|4.0|Just could never get into it that much, but that is why i gave it 4 stars, it had good graphics i just coulndt get into it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is an amazing tv series.  It reminds me of the quality we saw decades ago - not the twaddle that is embraced by much of the American people.  Thank you to the BBC for giving us characters to respect, honor and dignify - balanced by those like Thomas where we see the poorer qualities of the human character.<br /><br />There are men who are great examples for the boys & men of today, sadly lacking in the current culture.  There are despicable characters that present flaws we see in ourselves.  There are characters who make the decisions we would like to think we would make in similar situations.<br /><br />I truly hope they continue the series.  Treat yourself - you will be edified.
B0091QS88K|5.0|This game was a big hit for my daughter and her friends.  The full version has even more food options
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I chose this book because I liked the title and cover, and it turned out to be funny and sad and sweet. I enjoyed it so much!
B008GBCMHO|5.0|Very sweet Disney film, fun songs and a great cast.  Our 5 year old loves to watch it over and over again.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I was thoroughly engrossed in this series and didn't want it to end.  Although I know the story, it still makes me cry at the end.
B00AOB3FES|5.0|A great movie for kids, dog lovers, or just about everyone.  Beautifully animated and a sweet love story. I would recommond for all ages.
B0084ANCBC|5.0|arrived in good shape, classic addition to library, have not read it yet so cannot comment further at this time.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|I do not want to rate this. I did not watch it. So quit asking for ratings.  iii iii iii
B0084AXZK0|5.0|arrived in good shape;  classic addition to library, have not read it yet so cannot comment further at this time.
B000NMW6M0|3.0|This move moves so slow I found myself getting tired right away. I only watched it because it has that stud brad pitt. His performance was subpar.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|i really love this game....great hidden object plus an excellent thinking game. I would recommend this game to everyone who likes a good challenge!
B003XU3MWM|5.0|This movie has soldiers, swords, fire and blood. That should be enough for you to watch. If it is not, there are Romans. I am not talking about the lettuce but the legion.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|The person Rodriguez and the unbelievable real events drive this documentary. The filmmaking itself is not exceptional, but the story overwhelms.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|Voyager is a joy to watch. It is classic Roddenbury with a wonderfully positive view of mankinds future maturity.<br />If only the science in it was better I would give it five stars.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I did find this a page turner. Quick read and suspenseful with lots of unexpected twists. The characters were a bit irritating and not very likeable though.
B00ANAC32U|3.0|The only reason I bought this is because it was so hard to find a case for my Nexus S.  I bought it for twenty at google's own site.<br /><br />It's the bare minimum.  It's a bumper that's semi-hard and raises the glass front and back JUST above a flat surface.  The front and back of the phone are fully exposed otherwise.  I still find myself babying the phone and I can't just relax.  It's kind of pointless as far as \\"protection\\" goes though it's handsome.<br /><br />I've seen some pretty interesting soft cases out there and I think you should keep looking.<br /><br />Edit:  This bumper blocks your ability to use standard 3.5mm headphone connectors that don't have slim casings.  The diameter of the casing around the standard 3.5mm headphone plug will be greater than that of the bumper's cut-out so the plug can't be seated in the receptacle.  I have a pair of [[ASIN:B007GN0S4M Skullcandy Hesh Headphones w/Mic Athletic Blue (2012 Color), One Size]] that work with this bumper.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I know it is aimed at teenagers, but as an adult I really enjoyed it. Can't wait to read the others in the series.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The first several levels seemed to easy to beat but considering the price, it is a great way to waste time.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I thought this story was amazing. I could empathise with Cheryl on her quest to find herself and the adventure and journey that she went on was truly page turning.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I don't even know how I ended up downloading this app, I think because it was free that day. But it is actually a lot of fun. You get to style hair and cut it etc. The only thing I wish is that there were more characters, but it for sure is a cute game, my kids really enjoy it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I expected so much more from this book since it was the last one in the trilogy.  Hopefully the movie will be better.
B005KGPC4S|4.0|Great storyline,  because it could manifest into a true story, and similarly has.  On the line of the Waco incident
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great series. I got totally involved with the first episode and had to watch all available episodes. Can't wait for the new season.
1433502410|5.0|Not only is the ESV an easily understood translation, the study guides and extra features of this Bible will make it my &#34;go to&#34; book for years to come.  Wish I had purchased it years ago.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great app for on the go folks! I shop on eBay frequently and hate to miss out on auctions I'm bidding on. This app takes care of that-I can leave home and not miss a thing!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Rango was too funny from the start of the movie. As soon as the fish tank fell out of the car it was comical. Watched it  with my nephew of 9 years old and  he also thought it was funny.
B000068FWC|4.0|I had fond memories of this so when I got it on CD i was a little disappointed.  Like a lot of music from the not so distant past it hasn't aged all that well.  The Logical Song is great, a few others are good but overall it now sounds flat.  I'm glad to have it but a best of might have been a better choice.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|To begin with, I read this on my kindle. It's possible that the grammatical and spelling errors that populated &#34;Mockingjay&#34; were the subject of a bad software adaptation, or (more damning) a rushed production deadline. I debated between assigning one and two stars to &#34;Mockingjay&#34; and ultimately settled on one, because it represented such a disappointing fall-off from the first book. The plot was full of holes, the character interactions were wooden and predictable in bad ways (then unpredictable in worse ways), and ideas were introduced without suspense, relevence or explanation. I found myself rooting for the antagonists, hoping against hope that the rebellion would be crushed - then, at the end, my dislike for the plot and its characters was rewarded by the book and trilogy concluding in the most inhuman and philosophically offensive way possible. If you loved the first book in this series you should read the second book - but don't read this one. Your imagination can furnish a much better ending than the one provided by Suzanne Collins.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game on my kindle fire.Other game designers try to copy minecraft but they don't come anywhere close.This is so worth $6.99.I just love this game:)
B003O86FMW|3.0|Catching Fire seems like a book that was written to fulfill a contract, for people who wanted more &#34;Hunger Games.&#34; I'd have preferred a second cast of entirely different characters, maybe in the future - instead it was just a replay of the original book, with some cosmetic differences. It says a lot about the strength of writing that it's still a fun read - I didn't regret buying it - but I won't be reading it again.
B00BHU261S|5.0|anthony hopkins was amazing, and so was helen mirren.  scarlett played the role perfectly well also.  the make up was phenomenal for Sir Anthony!!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Cloud Atlas won't go down in the history books as great literature, but it's a terrific read for a cross-country or cross-atlantic flight. Engrossing, easy to follow and vivid, Cloud Atlas is one of those unusual books that leave you wishing for a little bit more. I would have given five stars but the British Publisher / Old-folks home subplot did little for me. No matter, it's a small part of the manuscript.
B004TI5N38|2.0|The others a right.  This is a blatant knockoff of Lee Child and Jack Reacher.  I had read the other reviewers who said so but frankly had to see for myself.  My apologies I should have trusted you.  Baldacci owes Child royalties and an apology.
B0023SDQB2|4.0|For those unaware of the historical background, in WWI there were a few British poet / writer - types who idealisitically joined up to serve with the Army and fight the Germans. After a couple years of trench warfare and the loss of many friends, some of these people came back with problems that we'd recognize as &#34;PTSD.&#34; Unfortunately, back then psychology was a fringe treatment - barely even considered to be scientific. Most people believed that madness was a form of weakness, and stigmatized. This stigma is still recognizable today. The book, which is well written (and feels accurate as a period piece) follows several historical characters, including the British poets Sigfried Sassoon and Robert Owens, and Sassoon's pioneering psychologist.
B0095P29EG|3.0|It was an OK movie, not as good as Iron Man I or II or as good as The Avengers (best movie in the series).  It was a little cheesy and the story was very jumpy.  Every other scene was a different world.  It was easy to follow but didn't allow for much continuity.  Anyhow, it was watching it on Prime for free from my couch.  I would have been disappointed in the theater but good pick at home.  \\
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|This is a great DVD of Woodstock and this version is well done. GReat performances with great bands and a real good overview of the event.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Both my husband and I enjoyed it and plan to get the next season. I like the characters of the Father and son scientist team!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Beautiful voice, beautiful music..I have listened to this CD over & over. Relaxing, inspirational, and the story behind Susan Boyle is really uplifting.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|My 6 yr old has watched this a dozen times since the pre release.  I've watched it with him each time and i'm still not tired of seeing it. Cute story.
0802473156|5.0|My wife and I love this book.  I refer back to its teachings on a daily basis.  It has helped me love my wife way better than I ever had prior and our relationship is the strongest it has ever been.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|If you like hidden object games this game is for you.  The objects are not too easy to find but not impossible either.  The story is easy to follow and the hint button is available if you get stuck.@
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|If you liked the original, then you will like this as well.  It is a fun Science Fiction, Adventure Movie.
B00821OX98|4.0|I had never heard of this series before seeing it on Amazon.  I wasn't expecting too much, but there was nothing on TV so I gave it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I watched the first episode and it was good enough to keep watching and after about 2 weeks, I had watched all of season 1 and 2, and I'm eagerly awaiting season 3.  I'm happy I ran into this series, it's good.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My 8 yr old niece plays this, so of course my 3 yr old wanted it downloaded to her Nabi Tablet.  She doesn't get very far, but has fun playing it.  Its pretty easy to play, addicting, and when you beat it, can keep playing bonus rounds, gather more money, buy more tools, and re-play the game.  Great for any age!!
0425263908|5.0|I loved my item! It was packed excelently. Arrived in estimate time and the item is NEW :) Amazing service!! Thanks.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I really enjoying playing this game...good game for the brain;  like that it is time;  don't have to put out extra bucks to continue playing.
6305428387|5.0|I miss John Candy!  This is just a fun movie about an &#34;almost&#34; tragedy in the 84? Olympics..  Hate to say it, but I saw the crash of the Jamaica team when it happened!<br /><br />Enjoy the movie!  Great movie for kids too...
0385340990|5.0|It is n ot Clancy, but I bought it on a recommend from a friend and found it charming.<br />would be a good candidate for a reading group.
0316044938|5.0|The Lovely Bones was truly captivating from the first chapter all the way to the end. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and it is going down as one of my favorites. It starts off very dark and creepy but ends with a happy -for most- ending. A victory for Alice Sebold.
B00950VMS0|5.0|Siempre he pensado que esta es la mejor pel&iacute;cula para actrices que desean ver una actuaci&oacute;n excelente. Una obra maestra de la cinematograf&iacute;a mundial.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Nice time killer. Would be nice if you could see how much stuff cost to build.Typical buy More coin sim
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I thought this was a very compelling book.  I am so glad that I read it.  It does tell more of both sides of the story of our history.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Ive really liked this season, so far.  Im so glad Olivia got back from the other side. I hope Walter treats Astrid better this season!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book.  Did not end like I thought it would.  Lots of changes in the book.  Would recommend the book.
B0000E1ALR|2.0|since it is music, i believe it depends on everyone's taste... it covers many years of mr springsteen carrer, but i think i would be better if i had bought some greatest hits album. in any case i can tell that, indeed, you can get a good idea about his work.
B007IQX9ZW|1.0|This was a terrible film. The acting was ok, but if I wanted to see a self-absorbed wastrel try to ruin someone's life, I would watch trashy reality TV.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun and addictive! The horses look life-like and is enjoyable to care for them. This game is fun for little. kids too.
B006RBZV82|5.0|Was enthralled through the entire movie.  It is only 45 minutes long (wish it were more) but the information contained was outstanding!  Leaves one wishing you could save the entire seas creatures.  So many I never had heard about or seen.  Wonderful movie for people of all ages.
1419705849|5.0|If you love to read diary of a wimpy kid, this is for u! It's very fun and really fun 2 read!
B004GYY714|5.0|The bery best way to listen to your favorite radio station from all around the world.  I have it loaded on my phone and my Kindle Fire HD.
B00571F26Y|3.0|While I think that Dr. Davis' theory is correct, in reality it is a difficult change of diet.  I have tried several of his recipes and the food was good.  However, I think it is unrealistic not to eat wheat.  I want to have a sandwich once in a while without baking my own &#34;wheat belly bread&#34;.
B000VHVGM8|4.0|A good ironic film,  it's full of fun. Though it is old, it is expressive, ,especially on actor performance skills.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Engaging and fun for all ages...detailed and colorful.  Plenty of detail, shows some research...makes playing more enjoyable.  Great to take for the kids.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|One of the best stories , l ever read , it contained all the levels of the human spirit.<br />This would be great book , for High school reading
B0044C5SCU|3.0|Show was ok but delivery was terrible, forever locking and needing a browser restart. Amazon also needs to look at improving its bookmarking setup to male it easier to return to a series you are watching.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't stop reading.<br /><br />The Hunger Games Trilogy will certainly give you plenty to think about.  I recommend reading this.
B003ASLJKO|5.0|I loved this movie because there was a lot of humor and as it goes, every movie is not worthy of Oscar attention but if you like Clint Eastwood, the addition of Burt Reynolds makes it more enjoyable because of the twist in humor.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|the big bang theory is getting better and better. it was already hilarious at the previous seasons but now it is my favorite laugh of the day
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's a good game great way to pass the time. Can get very frustrating but quite addicting to. I like it because you can earn coins to unlock different characters
B005LAIISA|5.0|It was a gift, and my recipient  enjoyed the story and the animation. I cannot comment first hand because I did not watch the film.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|Awesome story line...wish they could have done more with  Preston's family though...the kids were cool. Also loved Taye Digg's character's attitude and how he smiles all the time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great.  As soon as I downloaded, I was able to get all of my purchases in the archive.  Love it.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|Esta coraza protectora ha salvado en dos ocasiones a mi tel&eacute;fono celular, es liviana, c&oacute;moda al tacto y muy bien dise&ntilde;ada.
B00B3EV8IU|5.0|This album is different from anything else he's ever recorded... and why shouldn't it be? If you want the burning blue line era albums... go back and listen to that. You have to grow as an artist. This album is unique in that it was recorded entirely on the neck pickup of the epiphone pictured on the cover and has stand up bass instead of electric bass on it. Beautiful tones and playing. Instead of burning like on some of the earlier albums... Robben shows how the use of taste and space can make beautiful music. Its not complicated. But its great great music. I wish he would have wrote more tunes for the album but Im not gonna complain. The only original &#34;Oh Virginia&#34; is much like Riley B King from truth but better. This is the jazziest and most diverse album Robben has done to date. Theres funky blues, blues rock, new orleans blues, ballad blues, and jazz. Pick it up. You won't be disappointed.
B0040GUIAC|5.0|This is one of the classic movies & music sound tracks in my book. A blast from the past. Check it o u t for yourself. Listen to a few sound bites @ Amazon.
B0085LMFAE|4.0|Something a little different with a really great beat. Will have you dancing or at least tapping your toes. I remember buying the tape of this many years ago after watching a SNL performance.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I really enjoyed this Bond, but it did seem a little slower paced then the other Bond movies that star Daniel Craig.  Movie critics said this was the best Bond yet, but I don't think it's that cut and dry.
B002RB7VMA|4.0|I love the way Michael Buble makes old songs sound new again. He is a great artist. Listening to his music is wonderful but seeing him perform is even better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love rhis app its a great one  for kids and adults .. fun to play and not too much thinking involved . Just a relaxing game. Love it
B00BHMETKC|4.0|great piece of history and well-executed.  However, I was not convinced the foul language was a necessary addition to the story.
0385535147|5.0|This book was a gift, but my Dad really enjoyed this book.  He told me it was a very good book.  Thank you!
B003MC5N28|5.0|A very easy read.  Recommend you get the whole set at a discounted price.. because you will want to continue reading the whole series.
044022165X|5.0|This book was a gift to my Dad, but he said it was a very good book. He enjoyed reading it.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This book is a little gem. It is a must read if you want to be charmed and surprised by loveable and awful characters.  The correspondence is at once intimate and riveting.
B0088W4YTK|4.0|Its fun, has a interesting plot and worth a watch. The Wraith are a cool enemy. They remind me of vampires.
1439102813|5.0|Everyone I share this book with has the same response I had. Moving, insightful, unforgetable, unique.  You feel like you are experiencing the disease with her, inside her.  Nobody tells it from the inside out... until Genova.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|It's great if you like Glee and thoroughly enjoy vomiting special effects from SNL  What a waste of time. Ugh.
B00127RAJY|3.0|As I'm just getting back into exercising, this was difficult for me.  She said she would offer modifications but there really were none.  I ended up creating my own low impact modifications.  The sequence is good, I like the cardio, strength and abs split but the getting up and down is annoying for a person like me who is not that mobile yet.  I did like her go get it attitude and the way she explained and showed the correct forms for the exercises.<br /><br />Overall, I did lose inches but I found this very difficult for a beginner...
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love this case! It took a couple of days I get use to, but now I like it better than my otterbox! It's not to bulky, it's perfect!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Will most likely see the movie and compare!! Sweet love story with some very sad twists and turns kept the pages turning!!
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|The only problem with the app is that it randomly crashes. When you've just finished a reply to a blog and the app crashes, deleting your comment... yeah, you don't want to use that app any more.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I had an original album which was lost in moving.  Glad to get this, I love it.  Good for Paul Simon.
0062073192|5.0|I loved the book. It's very detailed and informative. As a fan of the show, I found it very interesting.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked the story, however I had a problem with Jo.  I liked the idea but it is not realistic.<br />I like all the booksoff Nicolas Sparks that I have read.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I downloaded this to see if my son would like it.  He is five but him and I have a blast playing it.  He loves the pictures!!!
B004I1WIWU|5.0|There is absolutely nothing that I can find wrong with this album. Absolutely amazing. Definitely deserved album of the year.
B000JIJPZY|5.0|I bought this for the baby to grow with because the head rest for 0-4 months and the other things for when baby is older.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|but telling of the story blah. Helen Mirren's character was 2 dimensional. And Hopkins upper lip thing was too much.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|With Seth McFarlane you never know what to expect and that held true here. While there were plenty of RISD tinged nods to the Griffin family back in Quahog, this movie was actually oddly credible and fun.
B001XV09UG|1.0|not worth the time to watch. big waste of time. poor plot. bad acting for reputation of the main characters
B0038P59A0|4.0|This movie made me remember that its star was stuck in a rehab time and time again and now he is back on track I hope for the long haul. This was the last movie I expected to see an &#34;action&#34; format to, but it surprisingly did! A cool story line, interesting characters. Downey seems to have an interesting parallel to Johnny Depp in some ways. The Watson character, whom I did not know prior, did a great job as Holmes foil/sidekick.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Not enough coins given out daily and almost impossible to win.  Would not recommend it to friends.<br />You require too many words for your 're Jews.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Tribute to Twin Peaks was awesome.  I felt there were elements of Fringe that took me back to the TP days and this was affirmed.  Totally cool!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game.  Lots of action and different challenges.  Very<br />y exciting to play . I  Would recommend it to everyone.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|Fringe really picks a lot from the X Files which if you liked, you'll like this as well.  It's remarkably similar and that's a good thing.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love this case. Purple is my color and this purple color is beautiful, just wish it had a place to keep the pointer. Other than that it's great!!!!!!!
B006PTNQGU|3.0|Again my kids love it age 3 & 5. as did i, many years ago. they also liked his home alone movies.
0316077046|5.0|This book was really good. Lena has to claim herself but she just runs away from her self. Ethan grow up a lot in this book and learn who he is.
B00766CLPI|5.0|I hadn't listened to to this album in years, and upon this new play, realized just how subtle and thoughtful Barbra's interpretations were for her at the height of her &#34;pop&#34; popularity and evolution. Sandwiched in-between &#34;Lazy Afternoon&#34; and &#34;A Star Is Born,&#34; this is quite a contrast. The two new tunes are lovely, but are not the reason to buy this disc. Her original repertoire will amaze a new legion of young fans, I'm sure. Intimate and emotional, this album is a &#34;must&#34; for all Streisand fans. She sings for the song, not to her legendary icon status. Bernstein was absolutely correct: &#34;It's clear that she loves these songs. In her sensitive, straightforward, and enormously appealing performance, she has given us a very special musical experience.&#34;
1433209144|4.0|Wonderful story.  Gripping from the get go.  Was a very quick audio.  Definately recommend, esp if you are an audio person.
1250007208|5.0|Great world-building, wonderful characters (and even the supporting characters are distinct and not flat archetypes plopped in to further plot points or support the heroine), does take a bit for you to figure out the overall plot line, but this is a truly unique spin on Cinderella.  I've read \\"Scarlet\\" as well, and that's also an original and creative take on Little Red Riding Hood.  I look forward to seeing how these worlds and fairy tales continue to collide.
080726203X|3.0|Quick.  Good story.  Well told.  Audio.  I do too many of these to be able to describe it in another 14 words.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is one of the most heartwarming, heart wrenching, and funny novels I've ever read.  Reading the story from the viewpoint of the family dog, Enzo, really makes one look at things differently and with such a unique perspective. I laughed out loud several times and cried, while rubbing my own dogs head, as the story ended. There were so many things that touched my heart about this story, from Eve's illness, Denny's struggles with his wife, career, and being a good father, and ultimately just how believable it was that a dog could actually think the way Enzo does. I'll never look at my dog the same way again! I loved it so much I told several friends to read it as well, and they've gone out to get it. I can't wait to hear how much they love it too (I know they will).
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|I'm very disappointed with this recording. He could have done much better. I have the Christmas album called Noel and<br />love it  but this one I wouldn't recommend. His compositions are too contemporary for my taste. I'm more of a classic<br />person.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Orson Scott Card delivers again in a book as thought-provoking as the first. Following the journey of Ender in his quest to restore and redeem himself, we are confronted with the essential questions of humanity. Beautiful in its fantasy, and yet still a philosophical discussion, this book has much to offer.
B008476HBM|5.0|One of my favorite Jane Austen books.  I have read it over and over again.  I actually read it while watching the story on t.v.  The book was soooo much better.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|This is a great children's movie for ages 3 to 11. The scenes, music and moral were fantastic. Great value for the money.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|While the premise and universe are slightly different it's a welcome spin on a time honored classic and both the main actors do it justice. Great show for people who like mysteries but are tired of the same ole same ole in procedural drama type mysteries.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|finding objects got a bit easier on into the game, which was good.  at first, many were too small or half off the screen, and yes, i used the zoom in.  it just seemed there weren't many rooms or many objects outside of the hidden object screens to find and use.  i guess if u look at &quot;letters some nowhere&quot; u'll see more of what i was expecting to play.
B003JA7P5G|5.0|I missed this season of The Gilmore Girls....<br />I am glad I purchased it....so worth the 45 dollars!<br />Great humor!
B002R5HR70|4.0|A must watch. I have watched it at least 20 times. Whitney is phenomenal, beautiful and clean! If your snowed in this is a good movie.
1596177373|5.0|Remember when cell phones had games on them that didn't require internet connection or service?<br />Well, since that's not an option anymore I keep a deck of cards in my purse- I consider the condom for boredom (just in case!)<br />These cards are well made, they only have artwork on the face cards but I wasn't looking for anything too fancy- the artwork is awesome and I'm a big fan. Can't wait for the next blizzard so I can rock some solitaire like a boss!
0307704610|4.0|There is lots of truth behind this book, however it could be a little bit more explicit about the diet and exercise, it jumps around a lot from diet to workout to diet again and its kinda confusing, but I'm doing what i believe will work, and I already feel stronger. Have not gained a lot of weight yet tho. And it doesn't say a whole lot in the diet section about what to really eat, it is very brief. I want more examples.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Touch, touch, touch makes it very fast.  The only negative is the hints feature.  Does the hint apply to the current play card or does it apply to the entire game at hand?
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|It turned out not to be the cord but the Kindle itself.  It has been replaced.  Thank you for all your assistance.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Bond - that's all you need to know - Action and Adventure.  Had everything you could expect - worth the time
B009RH9FR6|5.0|supper case , well built, love the rotating feature, I would recommend it to anyone wanting a high quality case
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Love Tommy Lee and John but this show is slow going and predictable. It has entertainment value however be prepared you'll have the urge to fast foward just to get things moving.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I have watched this DVD more than 10 times. Amazing casts and beautiful voices. If you are a musicals fan, you should not miss this one.
B000NMW6M0|5.0|I had never heard of this movie but when I was looking for a movie on Prime and saw Brad Pitt was in it, decided to go for it. It was a very compelling drama and kept me glued to the screen for 2 1/2 hours. Could not figure out how the three concurrent dramas in three different countries were going to connect but it all comes together at the end. I do not usually rate movies but this movie is well worth your time!!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I love it very much!! I have tried to sing&#34; wishing you were somehow here again&#34;.<br />Love Sierra's performance and her voice. Great show!
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I hadn't heard much before picking up this book but I found it a really enjoyable. I had never read Kate Morton's work before but like The Secret Keeper so much I have since bought The Shifting Fog. So far I like the Shifting Fog too but The Secret Keeper is better.
B007712XAU|5.0|I received this set as a gift, having never seen the show before.  What a wonderfully done series.  Completely British, and completely wonderful from set design to costumes to story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book one of the Hunger Games was great!  I typically do not read this type of book, I am more of a romance novel reader.  Many of my friends talked about how much they liked this book so I decided to give it a try.  It kept me on the edge of my seat and I could not stop reading.  The violence is there though presented in a way we're it is just enough.  The book also pulls you into a developing relationship without turning the story completely into that.  My daughter who likes the same type of books I do asked me to read this first, to see if she would like it.  I think even though she scares easily the story as a whole will draw her in and she to Will not be able to put the book down.
1451696191|1.0|I read this because it has been on the NY Times best seller list.  NOT my kind of book.  I tried to get into it but had a hard time finishing.
B004AQR24W|5.0|All of the greats in one place. Will put up with Steve Austin. (poorly designed character). All the others I grew up on great o see them in mature roles. Will watch many times, a well done movie
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read almost every book Grisham has written and have loved them all. This one has a nice twist at the end.
B007IK44CK|4.0|The first will always be the best. Great line up of actors, producers and special effects. An action thriller. Sme of the technology Is too futuristic, but a good watch.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is so similar to 50 shades of Grey, but I still loved reading this book. I finished it in a few days and couldn't wait to read the next one!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love White Collar and because of that, my son told me I needed to watch Suits.  I wasn't disappointed.  I love the characters and plot lines and the themes that continue thought the season.
