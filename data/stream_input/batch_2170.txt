0756990696|2.0|***2.5 Stars****<br /><br />As far as the literary quality of the novel goes, it's fairly decent. The author uses characters and the plot to create a dialogue that explains philosophical ideas and I think the author does a fairly good job. However, as far as a book that puports to be an introduction to the  history of philosophy, it is frustratingly inadequate. While the author included important figures like Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, and Kant and covered the period from classical Greek to early 20th century, he left out so many important philosophers and philosophical traditions. I'm not suggesting that he should include everything from the history of philosophy, that would be an extremely difficult and unfeasible task. What I am suggesting is that the author's introduction to the history of philosophy is highly selective, because he leaves out extremely important philosophers and philosophical movements that still influence contemporary philosophy. Specifically, in the 20th century, the author only dealt with existentialism, which is far from being the only philosophical movement in the 20th century. There are other really important philosophical movements such as Logical Positivism, Frankfurt School, and Phenomenology. The author left out 20th century philosophers like Ludwig Wittgenstein, Karl Popper, Quine, Kripke, Heidegger, Ardono, and others. Some of you may not know what these philosophers are, but they are very important: Wittgenstein's Tractatus helped revolutionized anglophone philosophy, Popper's falsifactionism really changed the landscape of philosophy of science, Quine's Two Dogmas of Empiricism arguably demolished Logical Positivism, and so on. What this suggests is that the author is not even an expert on the history of philosophy, but simply an intellectual who is very selective on what philosophers from the past impressed him the most such that he wants to summarize their views, but leave out the rest. Furthermore, the author focuses far too much on making the the ideas of philosophers intelligible to the readers, but either neglects or downplays the arguments. This is really unfortunate, because philosophy isn't about coming up with interesting ideas by magically pulling it out of one's sleeves, but rather it is about rationally and creatively developing arguments in order to come to an interesting conclusion. The author doesn't have to painstakingly go through each and every single detail of the argument but summarize it succinctly.<br /><br />People might reply that Sophie's world is simply a novel, not a serious yet \\"snobbish\\" academic endeavor on expounding the entire history of western philosophy. I would disagree with this reply for the following reason: What if there is a book called Jack's World which is about the History of Physics, but only talks about scientific discoveries, but never talks about the crucial scientific evidence and experimentation that lead to those scientific discoveries or explained why Heliocentric model was superior to the Geocentric model? What if it stops right at Neils Bohr (or Albert Einstein), but leaves out important physicists like Richard Feynman, Paul Dirac, Heisenberg, and Stephen Hawkings? What if it included Copernicus, Newton, and Galileo, but left out really important physicists like Hyugens, Kepler, Faraday, and Maxwell? Wouldn't it be reasonable for a historian of physics (or a physicists who admires Dirac) to be upset? Likewise, I think it would upset both historian of philosophers and philosophers that the book doesn't cover enough grounds. I'm personally upset, because I think there are important philosophers like Kripke, Quine, Putnam, Ryle, Horkheimer, Ponty, and Habermas that are left out of the picture, yet they reasonably belong to the history of philosophy (though some of them are not dead yet). I could imagine someone reading Sophie's world thinking that he (or she) has got the meat but is completely oblivious to important historical developmentsof philosophy that still influences contemporary philosophy today. While the author's intention to relate philosophy to life is laudable, he fails to relate it to the discussions in contemporary philosophy.<br /><br />To be fair, writing a novel that is essentially an introduction to the history of philosophy is very original, I can't think of any introduction to the history of philosophy that has done it, but from the very outset this approach already faces some serious obstacles such as deciding which philosophers and philosophical traditions are relevant and how to summarize the arguments and ideas. To make matters worse, the author is not a historian of philosophy. He certainly demonstrates familiarity with the history of philosophy, but that alone doesn't qualify him to uptake such a challenging task. This is obvious given that he has left out many important philosophers, which he isn't aware of.<br /><br />While the novel is both original, didactic, and well-intended, it fails to be an adequate introduction to the history of philosophy. I don't even think the term \\"inadequate\\" is the correct word to describe the quality of the book as an introduction, I am tempted to say that \\"abysmal\\" might do the job.

B0047WJ12K|5.0|Our whole family loves this movie. My daughter (12) spent her own money on it. It is a complex plot involving a futuristic technology that allows people to tap into other's subconscience to extract secret information during their dreams. As you watch the movie, remember that what is happening is a dream within a dream within a dream...  What occurs in a matter of seconds in real life can take several hours in the dream state. It needs to be viewed more than once to capture all the details and twists, which is why it's worth buying.

B0036TGSIK|5.0|This movie is a modern adaptation of The Scarlett Letter and it's brilliant. Emma Stone is the perfect actress for such a role, being both sexy and geeky at the same time. It's definitely not for younger kids as it centers heavily on sex, but it's great fun for teens and up.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I grew up listening to my mother who would refer to Les Misérables as a perfect example of injustice. If anything that was the thought that accompanied me the first time I watched the film. From the very opening scene, I was hooked. My first thought was that the first scene was absolutely mind-blowing.<br /><br />I only have positive things to say about this film. I was moved to tears by the performance of the lead characters. The death of all but one of what I call the &#34;revolutionary dreamers&#34; is so realistic, so well-portrayed, specially the death of young Gavroche, that you can't help but be saddened by their death.<br /><br />Les Misérables is a hunting film. Many can disagree but this movie will stand the test of time. 20 years from now, Les Misérables will still be regarded as an amazing masterpiece. The story itself is timeless, but to be able to achieve the same sentiment in a film, that speaks volumes of the quality of the work and the commitment of everyone involved in the creation of it.<br /><br />I enjoyed every song that was sang, that includes Crowe as well. He's great in the film and there's a reason why he was chosen. I believe that many of the people who hate his performance simply do it because they walk in to see the movie with specific ideas of what the film should be like and when none of those expectations are met, you get really bad reviews.<br /><br />The closing scene is very moving. I was so pleasantly surprised by all and I, too, found myself clapping at the end. In my opinion, the movie itself did great justice to Victor Hugo's masterpiece. I went to see it live after watching the film and there's so much that was so well-explained in the film, and so much that that medium allowed them to do. I'm glad I took everyone I could to see it and ended up watching Les Misérables a few times, which was fine by me. I will add this movie to my collection without a doubt.

0316056871|5.0|Just what you'd expect from a first person narrative by Tina Fey. It's hilarious, truthful, and not at all flowery. She tells it like it was for her: awkward.<br /><br />I laughed out loud many times while reading this book, and even made my husband listen to me read some passages aloud to him. As a female, Tina is someone who I really look up to as a role model for other young women. I love that she acknowledges that in the book. But she's not preachy, and she doesn't take herself too seriously.

0307272702|5.0|I read this entire book in a single day. I have been looking for something like this to explain the diet in an easy and clear way. I have many people in my life who have considered a low-carb, high-fat diet but they get bogged down by all the science. This book does not  do that at all. It's clear and to the point. I think this book describes what carbs (processed carbs like wheat, pasta, sugar) really have done to society.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a LCHF, or Keto diet but don't want to read too much science.

None-the-less, this was a very well-done and well-acted  film about a historic incident that was not well-known to most Americans.  By the way, thank you Canada, Great Britain and New Zealand from what I read your countries assisted our people much more that you were given credit for in the movie.  Don't miss this movie.

B004LWZWDS|5.0|Is it possible to manipulate the world without manipulating yourself in the process? Dangerous Liaisons is an 80s gem. Forgotten by many, remembered by fans of classical debauchery, Glenn Close, Michelle Pfeiffer, and the star of the show: John Malkovich. Dangerous Liaisons came out in 1988 and was directed by Stephen Frears. This film could pair well on a double feature bill with Wall Street. These films overflow with dishonesty, abuse of privilege, and are essentially allegories about the pitfalls of greed. Dangerous Liaisons is really historic artistic escapism. The story is set in France around 1760. The look, feel, costumes, and place designs all set you directly into the action.  John Malkovich plays the villain role of Vicomte de Valmont to perfection. He is basically a rich powerful man of privilege that uses his influence to manipulate women. Vicomte de Valmont insatiably starts an an affair with every woman within arms reach. Once his conquest quota has met capacity he falls desperately in love. He becomes a spider trapped in his own web and escape is futile.  Lust. Seduction. Revenge.  Take your pick. Dangerous Liaisons is the ultimate 18th century soapopera. This film was a success and remains a worthwhile venture down immorality lane.  Dangerous Liaisons was nominated for seven Academy Awards. It won awards for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Costume Design, and Best Art Direction. If there was an award category for decadence,  Dangerous Liaisons would have \\"possessed\\" the competition.

B008AUGEFC|5.0|My son suggested strongly that I see the movie, comparing it the Kim Stanley Robinson novel, The Years of Rice and Salt, which all the members of the family read.  While it is true that both novels deal with characters who re-incarnate through many historical periods, the similarity ends there.<br /><br />David Mitchell is a superior writer and his aim here is very different than Robinson's, who still spun a very good yarn and created an engaging book.<br /><br />Here, I must digress a bit and say that I recently reread another book which reminds me of Mitchell's, the late John Fowles' The French Lieutenant's Woman.  When I was in grad school at Detroit's Wayne State University, a professor who taught the Romantics came in and announced a brilliant new novel by Fowles in which the author had recaptured the Victorian novel.  Fowles did that.  Reading it at 22 +/- and rereading it 45 +/- years later, I still loved the novel but I saw in it greater scope and purpose than simple literary showing off.<br /><br />And Mitchell IS showing off, which may be why one reviewer spoke of his ego.  I'm sorry, this is not ego.  It is craftsmanship.  It is the manifestation of great ability.  It is a tour de force.  However, I wonder if Fowles hadn't pushed the boundaries of literary creation and recreation and examination, it it would have been possible for Mitchell to have written Cloud Atlas.<br /><br />I can not say that \\"The Pacific Journals of Adam Ewing,\\" are an homage to Herman Melville or to 19th C writers in general but the adaptation of that style amused me.  I know, sadly, it turned off other readers.  I will say that the book does bow to Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World and refers obliquely to them.  It also bows to Wells' The Time Machine and Neville Shute's On the Beach.<br /><br />I did not mind that the connections among the characters was implied.  I still haven't decided whether each principal but one -- Ewing, Forbisher, Rey, Sonmi and Meronym -- are the same person with only Timothy Cavendish standing alone or whether the connections go in different ways.  The movie made its own set of connections but more about that later.<br /><br />I found the assumption of different authorial voices brilliant.  My hat is off to Mitchell who certainly is one of the most accomplished writers living.<br /><br />My criticism (BTW, I write this with large spaces which will not show up when this is published.  So sad.) of the book is the \\"hip-hop\\" chapter, \\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After,\\" which, I feel, parodies On The Beach.  The dialect was difficult to read.  however, as it is placed in the center of the book and is not repeated, it is the pivot on which the book turns.  What we see afterwards is that Ewing, Forbisher and Rey were among the more enlightened people of their times.  I think that Mitchell invests more, not less, in this section.<br /><br />Now, about the movie.  I loved the film version of The Name of Rose.  Then I read Eco's novel and rewatched the movie.  I hated the movie with the second viewing.  I fear this movie will not survive my good opinion if I see it again.<br /><br />I saw it at my son's urging.  He told me that it is a typical Tom Hanks' movie, which means great acting and a confusing story.<br /><br />There are some things the movie did which were daring.  For instance, the \\"achievement in makeup\\" was superb.  The viewer is confronted with two faces, one male and one female.  Who are they?  Then, they speak.  Tom Hanks!  Susan Sarandon!  Disguising those so familiar faces is remarkable.<br /><br />The movie's editing is also unparalleled and it, like the book, is showing off.  I loved the scene in which Halle Berry put her hand on a doorknob as one of her characters and walked through as another.  However, the movie drew parallels that I am not certain were supported by the text.  I would love to talk to David Mitchell about that.<br /><br />The movie also took some liberties with the characters, most notably in the \\"Sloosha's Crossing\\" section although the casting of Halle Berry as Meronym in the Wachowski's version of that segment was right.  I'm not familiar with the mega-successful Wachowski family.  I am uncertain whether I saw The Matrix.  I know I did not see V for Vendetta.  Obviously, this is a creative team with its own vision.  My older son is interested in the movie because of the Wachowski involvement.  However, I wonder why they felt a need to give the movie a happy ending.ers, most notably in the \\"Sloosha's Crossing\\" section although the casting of Halle Berry as Meronym in the Wachowski's version of that segment was right.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. Far better than Temple Run, because you don't have to tilt, which allows you to play laying down.

You get to play with friends also.

0547884591|4.0|There are some really great ideas here. And lots of helpful information about healthy eating, lifestyle, learning, and sustainable food sourcing. To no one's surprise at all, there are also some truly unique recipes. The presentation format will force you to learn how to actually cook instead of just repeating steps found in other recipe books. It's an experience rather than a cookbook.<br /><br />But this is also a Tim Ferris book, which means that, along with the awesomeness, it will tend to also be on the scattered side. An additional editorial pass might have been helpful here. Most frustratingly, some recipes are missing steps or practical considerations. There are some some weird layout issues and detours in strange places as well, which may be the fault of the ebook format rendering rather than the content itself (I have a kindle copy).<br /><br />If you can deal with a few frustrations, and improvise a bit, you'll find that this makes for a really interesting read for someone who wants to learn to cook better, or just learn something new in general. In fact, some of the best parts of the book tend to fall into the category of \\"unorthodox thinking and learning\\" rather than being specific to cooking.<br /><br />It's almost as if there are two books here, both of which would be quite on their own, but their manic competition for reader mindshare may be a bit too frustrating for the average reader.

0425252868|5.0|This is a keeper book.  I am not an aviation expert but I was riveted to every word.  I worry that ebooks will be read & forgotten but this is a book to be passed down.  I am giving it to my son-in-law who loves the military and airplanes, but that is not the reason I hope he one day has his sons read it. It is such a magic story about chivalry and respect even between enemies.  It is also only the second book I have read besides Irwin Shaw's &#34;The Young Lion&#34; that gave me insight into the German soldier's point of view. I hope English and History teachers put it on their reading lists.
B0063IH60K|5.0|awesome I play it a lot since getting the app...... much better than the one's in windows 7. I love the brightness of the screen
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I've watched the blue-ray version of P&P many times and always enjoy it along with the extra features.  Highly recommend it.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|Purchased this in advance of its debut, thrilled to have it 2 days after release with free amazon.com shipping.<br />A new CD for Josh Groban is always enjoyed, however, found myself disenfranchised from this particular ensemble with fewer heartfelt and memorable melodies. &#34;Brave&#34; is my favorite on this CD, and I thought &#34;When I fall in Love&#34; was a remake of Nat King Cole, however, it is not. Still a nice song, just not the tune I knew. Not a fan of his duet with Laura Pausini as she is whiney, grating, and detracts from Josh.<br />3 Stars because I was unaware that a limited release of same CD with 4 bonus tracks, Changing Colors;Satellite; (nice remake of Dave Matthews Band version), Grazie; and my very favorite of this release Josh's version of Neil Diamond's &#34;Play Me,&#34; was available only at Target, whose website, unlike amazon.com, does not list the tracks on the CD or allow you to preview them. As a Grobanite, I rushed to Target and purchased the extended version and very glad I did.<br />If you are a Grobanite, or buying this as a gift for someone who is Josh-crazy, you should know that the more Josh the better, as is the case with the extended version and more melodic and enjoyable. Get the one with the bonus tracks, some of the strongest songs of this release.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works well on my Kindle Fire. I was happy when I could put in my hometown for forecasts. And I really appreciate the 5-day feature.
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a fun book with and I liked the characters. It made me want to read the next book.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|This a good app, it just is to expensive for something that you will probably only use once. Pretty cool but its more like twenty questions. I wish I didn't get it. :(
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good book! Can't wait to read the next one. I'm not sure the movies can do it justice. Yay
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Game started out free but four dollars and you get the rest . My attention span is not great having said that I thought the graphics were good want more puzzles . Maybe it looks likely a sequel looking at the end ,
1250027624|5.0|This book is a must have for all the Down Abbey fans out there such as myself.  This book was received in perfect condition and was shipped very timely.  Highly recommend.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|lot of back and forth, lot of excitement! Great  season, thanks. if nex season is anything like this one, we're really looking forword to it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is one of the finest of the over 400 Sci-Fi books I have read. Followed by Shift 1, 2, 3 which is a prequel leading up to Wool and to be continued with a final series called Dust. This is an entire world class adventure with total originality and artistic flair that is great at it's worst and beyond brilliant as it's norm. I have long thought that Amazons 5 star rating is inadequacy as nobody likes to bash new authors so I tend to go on a 1-10 with this book up there in the very upper boundaries of human imagination.
B00A46H3J6|4.0|This is a very good album, I did not discover anything new that I hadn't heard on radio etc. But still a good buy for those like myself who are just now  discovering this movement.
0307341550|5.0|I loved it! G. Flynn is truly a gifted writer.  She conjures up complete detailed pictures in my head & the prose flows like melted butter. Her latest book drew me in but her earlier books are compelling, dark and powerful. One of my newest favorite authors!
B00000F7MS|5.0|I highly recommend this movie.  Your kids will love it and you will, too.  It has it all:  humor, catchy songs that you'll never forget and a great story!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|the game shows kids how respondsible you have to be with pet's. you even design your horse the way you like it.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|Works great does what it supposed to do. And way cheaper then most tuners. Yes it's plastic, but I'm not out touring the world every night. I guess if you stomped on it it wouldn't last to long but if you press on it like a normal person it will be just fine. Any ways if it does break there cheap enough to buy another
B000PAAH3K|4.0|This book follows many others describing the hidden realities of how we tick.  But there's good self-discovery offered in the insight of &#34;the-how&#34; our mental functions actually appear to operate.<br /><br />It is evident that we are almost all naturally outfitted to be many times more mentally powerful and efficient in our existences, yet almost none of us recognizes this capacity.  Forget the self help, self actuation, self motivation books and lecturers - use this book and others like it to truly begin to understand how we really work.  So many things will begin to make sense from direct experience - instinct, seeming extra sensory recognitions, gut awareness, hunches - all that sensory input that each of us absorbs day to day gets analyzed, strained and assigned a level of recognition, long before we are consciously aware of why we do or think what we do.<br /><br />This book is an excellent addendum to the Human Animal Operating Manual.
B0019IB0II|5.0|An inspiring and amazing journey from a stroke through discovery and healing ... inside looking out.  Jill studied the brain before her stoke and was aware of what was happening ... and observed the event with understanding ... great tips on how to communicate and how to treat a victim of a stroke for better healing.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Bit different than your typical Bond movie and I think that was why I liked it so much. Great movie!
1848507836|5.0|Anita's story is fabulous ... her journey to the other side and the insight she has brought back has been a tremendous help in our recovery from our son's unexpected death ... I've seen Anita interviewed also, and it touches me to watch her husband emotions even now some 4 or 5 years later ... as she shares her story ...
0345803485|4.0|So many people I know read the book or were talking about it.  I caved in and bought the book.  The writing is not the greatest, but it definitely has some great steamy scenes.  I thought Christian Grey is quite the hottie and found Anastasia to be annoying most of the time.  Without Christian Grey this book would be nothing.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I've tried a few of the G5 games. So far this is my favorite. It's challenging enough that it keeps the interest but not so challenging that it becomes frustrating. The graphic are pretty cool. The narration is a bit silly. But I usual just lower the volume. Is it with 5 bucks? So far I haven't found a game that is.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a good game and I like it. Even though it can be a little choppy sometimes it is still fun to play. I like it so there you go.
B00003CWTI|5.0|The DVD was in perfect condition. The packaging was nice and snug. I will buy from this user again. Very trustworthy and worth every penny! Made a wonderful Valentine's Day gift. I also received my DVD right on time. Decent prices as well. Thank you for my movie!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like angry birds, it helps to pass the time and I like it more without the ads. Thanks for that.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|Believe it or not but I liked this movie better then all the others that starred Matt Damon. This dude does a killer job but he is not trying to replace Matt Damon in this movie he is just another fighter.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I have adobe reader on my computer so I downloaded it for my tablet. I hope it works the same as the computer so I don't know its there but does what I need.
B007RXRSEY|4.0|This is the best material Slash has put out since the GnR days. I listen to this CD all the time here lately. I recommend it to Rock lovers.

B00881VLCE|3.0|This is a fun app - but a little clumsy in the using.  I also really don't need the musical background.  However, as stated, it is kind of fun.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I absolutely loved the choreography of this movie!!!<br /><br />I love the concept in the art museum!!  Yes the dancing is done in \\"weird\\" places but that is the point to their sensationalism in trying to win the contest.  Would their videos have that many hits if they'd danced in dance room setting?<br /><br />The acting is decent.<br /><br />The ending is the weakest part of the plot (not the dancing part but the actual plot).  It's kind of sappy.  I did have to laugh though when the mayor starting getting into it when the girls started dancing.  Again, sappy but funny.<br /><br />I should of given it four stars for the ending but I just like the dancing too much :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such a wonderful app! So many cool horses to buy. There<br />could be more horses to buy with coins though. It is still a cool game!!
B0017I1IZA|3.0|the editorial reviewer who said this book wasn't as good as her others. It wasn't, but even that still merits four stars. It still made me laugh out loud, feel miserable and also cringe horribly (particularly towards the end).
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It keeps you wanting to play more and more. I love how real the effect are to the real machine.
0345803507|5.0|I am very satisfied with my purchase. Serious sender, impeccable quality of product, Book very well packed. Thanks a lot
B005LAIHCM|3.0|There is a place for those 2 1/2 star movies that are actually, well, kinda good. I think this is one of them. There's something going on here that makes it a worthwhile watch, imo. But I can't tell you, or you'd have to kill me! No, actually, because telling you would spoil it. Anyway, just the relationship dynamics, and also the talented actors, keep you interested, and I can tell you that much.
0345803493|5.0|I am very satisfied with my purchase. Serious sender, impeccable quality of product, Book very well packed. Thanks a lot
B0091REZMW|3.0|I just started playing this game and it is pretty good so far.  I only have it 3 stars because I haven't been playing it for very long and don't know a whole lot about it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I wasn't impressed with book one but book two was good. Looking forward to book three. Overall I think the series is over rated.
B0078Q2HAA|5.0|It is exactly that. A brief but economical overview of Thatcher's PM.The film places us not in the political arrangement of a conservative PM but that of a female PM. Which I can appreciate.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best series ever for PBS!!!! Thanks to the funders!!!!<br />Give me more and more of this series.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I completely adore this CD!  + is an amazing work of art.  The songs on this album are soulful and relatable. Ed Sheeran is truly talented. Great purchase.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I chose this because of the different colors and how easy it is to use.  I can keep notes, calendar info. etc. with it.  I am thinking about having this app put on my phone.  It seems to be easier to use than the one that came with my phone.
B004WESFZW|5.0|I love the concept of this film and I was easily immersed in the plot and the characters. A really good adventure film.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I can read this book over and over again. I love the why she discribes Sam and Grace's love. You see it through oth of there eyes as the story swiched back and forth. It's not like any other warewolf book you will ever read. It does't go into all of the stareotypes you think of when you say warewolf. It is absolutly amazing.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|What I was really impressed with was the fantastic editing which helped move the movie at break neck speed. I can easily watch this film over and over. The Scott brothers have left us with a classic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent show.  We were grateful to be able to see the episodes we had missed since they could not be found on Netflix.
B005OK725M|5.0|I stumbled on this movie on cable and watched it numerous times. I say it's unbelievable because it really is but the production values make this move extremely entertaining and I find I am still watching this over and over.
B004TI5N38|3.0|It was a good read, kept my interest and moved along at a good steady rate. I would recomend it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was wonderful! Truthfully, the subject matter was quite a bit heavier than I expected but I couldn't put this book down. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great work if fiction.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|I opted to try the \\"free\\" version.  After waiting 2+ HOURS for it to download I began the game and @3 scenes in it told me I had to purchase to continue.  It had better be worth the $2.99 I paid to actually play the game.....Definitely not worth the money.  I have played much longer games for less money.  And the download time was ridiculous.
0792839749|4.0|It was fun to sing along, with the words on the screen.  I used this for a elementary music class.
B001UEBHYS|5.0|SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE has it all: a strong, focused storyline; fine acting by all (but especially those who play the central characters); ultra-sharp cinematography that captures Mumbai and much of the rest of India with captivating immediacy; and strong human interest elements that should appeal to people the world over. In the end, however, it's not any one of these elements or even the combination of them that makes this film what it is. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE just has that inscrutable \\"something about it\\" that makes it a true stand-out.<br /><br />Although it's often described as a \\"feel-good\\" movie, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE also gives a starkly realistic portrait of the Mumbai slums, showing how life there (and any hope for something better) is left both to the individual and to chance. The themes of karma and destiny support the plot beautifully--the way Jamal faces and ulimately prevails against overwhelming odds is riveting. It's both funny and grim, admirably meshing these two qualities: a true tragi-comedy.<br /><br />The one little caveat I might offer is that SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is a two-hour epic (and for some reason, seemed longer to me) that verges on being overwhelming. While it never plods, it's a story that demands patient attention and should be viewed by those who are ready to give it.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|This is one real Jewel of a film. Seeing Count Dracula as an over protective father was a great touch.<br />Throw in a human as his daughter's Love interest  and we have caucus.<br />George
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Easy read. Very good story.Wanted the ending to be different but we can't always have what we imagine would be a good ending.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works beautifully on my Kindle HD. I hate it on my Android phone though, it takes up so much room on my internal storage. The updates are huge.
1423124960|5.0|My daughter loves this book. It does feel kind of brittle. But many stories in one book. Great buy so far.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I have this on my Kindle HD since it doesn't have a writing app, and it works great. Organizable, searchable and shareable. Everything I was hoping for.
B000AMSSAW|5.0|I decided to upgrade my vhs collection to dvds. So glad I was able to find this one. It plays great and i am very happy.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Easy to use, nothing fancy and nothing my phone doesn't already have built in but it's great to have for the Kindle.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|You never  know where the story might go!<br />Can't wait for the next book. I think I might need to reread the first two again!
B004GYY714|3.0|Couldn't get some of the stations to load and I couldn't figure out how they were organized. I uninstalled it.
B0074PNCRM|2.0|I had trouble believing the characters, especially the young ones. A bit too sentimental for my liking, but easy enough to read and be slightly moved by the subject matter.
B005HSL626|5.0|Such a great, timeless game. You can unlock achievements and new swag and the graphics are amazing on the Kindle HD.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|A great movie that is more about alcoholism and less about the incredible stunt the flawed hero pulled off in order to save a hundred lives.  The plane crash scene will almost bring you to tears but the highlight of this movie was Denzel's incredible performance.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|For a free app, it's pretty cool. You only have one workout curcuit though and have to upgrade to get customized workouts, but you can change the length of it on the free version. I would consider upgrading, it's very fun and helpful.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Graphics are great. Very detailed game. Keeps you occupied. You have to pay in order to get the full version but it's worth it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Although I liked it MUCH better before the fancy update. Now it's too busy and complicated. It used to be much simpler and right to the point.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I'm addicted to the Nikki Heat series.  A good murder mystery without all the blood and gore.<br />Top notch!  I hope the servies continues.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|lots of fun for a 68 year old grandmother.  easy to understand how to play.  It has a large selection on games and I like them all.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I'm addicted to the Nikki Heat series.  A good murder mystery without all the blood and gore.<br />Top notch entertainment!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Hard for a 68 year old grandmother to understand how to play.  But, my grandsons love it.  I just got it to see why kids like it.
B00433TO52|5.0|I would reccomend this to college students, high school students, and anyone who loves literature.  By the master of literature.  All his works in one book.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|This is a great tool to help you highlight your attributes. Its very effective and positive, thats what America needs!
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|A side from Jason Momoa being the perfect Conan and being totally fine, the movie was blah. Hope the sequel will be better.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like it because you learn some physics of the world. Most people get this game because it is really addicting.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|If you have loved ones that struggle with addiction, this movie will resonate with you. Great depiction of the wrath alcoholism leaves behind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|such such such such such such such a great frieken game never seen any thing like it so amazing beast
1423140591|5.0|amazing story<br />rick riordin is the best<br />we all know that<br />i love all his books and this seris in general
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this story, it was so beautifully written.  I have to see the movie.<br />Such a beautiful story, but this one left you wanting to know more about the future.
B0023S50DO|4.0|With all the news of the comet coming so close within the last month I thought this movie was timely. Great resolution.
B000063S6Z|5.0|you made it easy to find a song I had only heard in a pictorial of a beautiful white draft horse some where in europe shown on the web.  She was an equine goddess.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The Twilight series captured my attention and held it without pause. The characters were, although fiction, were believable and captivating. I truly enjoyed reading each book.
0446554995|3.0|As I began reading this novel – following my favorite literary character – I sensed a difference in the writing.  Pendergast had always been a unique figure; to me almost a modern Hercule Poirot – more cerebral than the characters most modern-day novelists characterize.  But it seems now that he is becoming just another action hero.  For example, at the beginning of this novel we find him jumping on the wing of a plane taking off.  Come on now!  Guys (meaning Preston and Child), you can do better…you can be more creative.  In fact, after I got a bit into the novel and was feeling not so “welcome”, I read some of the reviews here on Amazon, and one caught my eye --  C. Irish used the term “hogwash”.  And that sums up what Pendergast was in the early pages of this novel.  As the other reviewer indicates, it’s fun hogwash to read, but it’s not the clever and intellectual Pendergast we once knew and loved.  And then, toward the end of the novel, he again seems to be turning into a super hero.<br /><br />In between, and for most of the novel, things settle down and we get back to the Pendergast so many of us have fallen in love with.  But, I’m beginning to be put off by his dismissive and insensitive attitude toward Vincent D'Agosta, a friend who comes to his aid whenever needed, but is treated abominably by Pendergast.  If I were D’Agosta, I’d tell Pendergast to go…well, you know.  D’Agosta is an interesting character in and of himself.<br /><br />Now, I will give our novelists credit for one thing.  I’m almost always rather loathe to read a book or watch a movie that has anything to with Nazis.  I just kinda got over that once I got out of high school.  Once in a great while a story about Nazis will catch my attention and be quite good…and this one falls pretty much in that category.  It’s a stretch (back to “hogwash”), but at least this was relatively entertaining.<br /><br />I have this feeling that perhaps – and this happenswith popular authors every once in a while – that Preston and Child put some scenes (might as well be frank) in the novel that would work well in a movie…rather than for the integrity of the novel.<br /><br />A suggestion guys:  The subplot about Constance is interesting enough to be a novel in and of itself (with Pendergast as a relatively minor character).  Please think about doing it!
B00933JF74|1.0|Okay I read the reviews and thought this might be fun but its not. The explaination of game play does not go into crucial detail on how to start making the townsman build the .the little guy stops in mid stream sleepss and i cant get him back. Youtube friegn guy is a joke nobeyter than game tutorial.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is so much fun and refreshing New graphics and sounds.  I highly recommend it to angry birds fans.  Better without ads.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Melancholy, but full of life. Loved it from start to finish and always drew me in to the experience the stages of the up and down battle of cancer. John Green writes so honestly and is blunt, but says things in a way that you cannot forget. Beautiful!
B002ZDOXLW|4.0|The music was not what I would expect from the front cover of the disc. Or from the title, it has a Middle Eastern sound not ancient.
B009IA9OLE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game. You play as Max McMann, a hot shot defense attorney who takes on a bizarre set of clients and some equally strange prosecutors. The gameplay is a basic knock-out game, with the goal being to use your various abilities to eliminate the other side.<br /><br />Pros: Good graphics and clean game play. Even better is the humor and the music; for those who love the 80s, the theme song alone is almost worth the price of purchase.<br /><br />Cons: Only a little replay value as none of the cases change from game to game. Also helps to have cultural knowledge of the 80s, as most of the game's jokes are based on that period.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Can't wait for each new episode....fabulous! The characters are well developed and endearing.  Season 2 is just as good as Season 1 and hasn't fizzled out....
B00AJLHULW|2.0|I have to agree with some of the other 2 star reviews . Robben , for whatever reason went to the well once to often . He is a great guitarist and more so musician . He brings a lot of good to the table when he supports other projects or collaborates . This CD , sounds good , plays good and for someone who never heard Robben before \\" is \\" good . I've heard him do SO much better . The bulk of the CD is cover material and these performances show no creative grit . If you don't own this CD you're not missing anything .. if you do you're short a few dollars . I'm not sure if bringing this Back Home was a good idea .
B000FC10HA|4.0|Older marketing (and business) books are great for identifying where they appear to be full of crap and where they seem to have captured long-lasting truths.  This one has lasted a long time, and its held up a great deal of value over time.  It's the second book in a custom marketing study course I'm doing, and I (software developer that I am) learned a great deal.  Worth it.  Even though I hate books titled like this one.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really good it shows how much is left before you need to backup battery.  I had it as a free app but it is worth paying for have not decided yet whether I will upgrade to paid version.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Watched this one on a snow day from school.  It was excellent and would recommend for anyone that love British movies as I do, especially when they are based on history.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Having been an avid cinema buff for 50 years and having seen most of the James Bond movies (excluding most the dreadful Roger Moore era), it's easy to be jaded.  But Skyfall may be not only the best James Bond movie to date (we've all said that before), but one of the best movies of 2012. For those of us who were around when Sean Connery set the standard for the role, we never thought he could be  supplanted.  And for decades, that has been true.  His successors (Lazenby--pilloried at the time but gaining respect for his one outing); to Roger Moore (very disappointing considering how charismatic he was as the Saint); to Timothy Dalton (unappreciated and ahead of his time); to Pierce Brosnan (who was also considered maybe the best Bond to date--but then his movies lapsed into some of the gadgetry silliness and he became stale in the role.<br /><br />The critics prematurely and unfairly scalded the producers for selecting Daniel Craig--but he has set through his three Bond movies (or re-set) James Bond as a hard edged, imperfect man---probably closer to Ian Fleming's original characterization.<br /><br />But to the movie itself--technically, the blu ray is perfect.........as to the movie-considering it's length (in excess of two hours), it moves at a breath taking and exciting, no nonsense pace.  Craig is dynamic and hard edged in his role.  And it is interesting how the reboot---which started with Casino Royale---now comes full circle....starting with the reintroduction of \\"Q\\".  And by the end of the film (the last 10 minutes are riveting) we now see certain other characters reintroduced.  And we see the transition of the role of \\"M\\".  The blend of today and the \\"60's style\\"---even down to Craig's very British, narrow lapeled, slim suits--is both mind bending and fascinating.<br /><br />By the fourth Brosnan film, I had dispaired that either these films were just too formulaic to survive (or I was getting too old and jaded). But Daniel Craig has breathed new life into the role.<br /><br />Here's hoping he will be filming addition James Bond films.  It's difficult to see who could top him.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|It's impossible to NOT like this story. A quick read, lots of crying and characters who seem real. Recommend Slammed to any girlfriends who are \\"reluctant readers.\\"
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I liked this film.  an older guy, the music was great. Acting was very good, especially the over the top John Goodman character. The small uninteresting diversionary side stories were very few and very short in my opinion. Plane sequence was good. I'm not a movie reviewer or big film buff. There are things I like, and things I don't. This was a great film to watch and recommend it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved all three books..... great read.  Will highly recommend. The movie doesn't do it justice. Can't wait for the second movie
030758836X|5.0|I was impressed every minute I was reading this book and enjoyed almost all of it: I was pretty uncomfortable throughout the last chapters, but that's another compliment: that a book can create a response so powerful in me.<br />I think it was an incredible book, even though the actual story was INSANE!  The way the themes of the book wove in and out of the social landscape of our decade was masterful: Job Loss, a ghost town created by the 2008 economy crash, the way the media exploits these types of stories.  There is just so much there that tells the \\"American Story\\" of today.  I couldn't be more impressed. The commentary on relationships today was scarily insightful; not the main relationship, of course, which was what I would call 'something else', but the courting process and how we draw each other in was apt.<br />I recommend this book to anyone with a strong stomach for raw emotion and explicit language and situations.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really liked this story, although it was sad.  It was written well and edited well which is rare! Good story!
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|Equipment:<br /><br />Pioneer Elite VSX-51 7.1 Channel<br />Pioneer Elite BDP-62 Universal BluRay Player<br />Klipsch Synergy Series 7.1 (several years old, nicely broken in)<br /><br />I own this in era correct vinyl and on CD. I hadn't listened to either more than a few times the last decade so I gave them a whirl. The vinyl still shines despite a few pops. I'll likely never again listen to the CD. The DTS-HD version adds something new. The surround sound is immersive. Purists should stick to 2112 on vinyl (I am not rating the included remastered CD here). This version uses all 5.1 speakers to create a seamlessly encompassing sound field. This is the best high-res audio disk I own at doing this, better than even the SACD version of Dark Side of the Moon. A video graphic novel accompanies the music and is fun to watch. I would like an Audio-Only menu option for times I just want to listen (HDMI connections won't let me turn off TV without BDP shutting off - annoying - future firmware update please Pioneer!!).<br /><br />I also bought the BluRay Audio edition of Moving Pictures which is, by contrast, engineered with a more traditional soundstage. I'll post a review of that disc also.<br /><br />Sit back, close your eyes, enjoy!
B0067R0APK|1.0|I really wanted to use this ap but it is not a good fit for me since it cannot find my location.
B000N3AVNA|4.0|This is a way out there comedy.  Like the Scary Movies and Airplane movies.  If you like comedy like that you can't go wrong here. And it's funny seeing the Two men from Two & a half Men before that show together.
B007R0WHMK|5.0|The actors in this film are fantastic, I love the storyline. Some people may not like the very end of the movie but I feel it's poetic and clever.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Before Clint Eastwood went off his rocker talking to empty chairs he made a really good movie about a guy out of place learning a lot about others and himself.  It's a great tough Clint Eastwood movie.  It has a great lesson in it too.  One of Clint's best.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Controls are at sweet. Music is soothing. Graphics are top notch. No advertising yay. Camera tilt works right. Most polished game I have played on my DROID razr.
B00003CXIY|4.0|This movie has a lot of &#34;stars&#34; in it.  It's wild and funny.  If you get in a down mood this will make you laugh.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is good to help me unwind at the end of the night.  This is a game that most will enjoy.
0790742780|4.0|I love this story about a guy pushed a little too far.  He does what we all daydream about doing.  It's a very interesting story.  With humor and action all mixed together.  Everyone should watch this.
B00785P2QC|5.0|My son and I love this game. Good for kids and grown ups alike. Wish invest points were easier to get.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think its the best game ever but it ducks you're battery<br />make sure you up grade it u can also pocket editor
B00BETX5PS|4.0|It was worth renting.  I just wish amazon would let us have more then 24 hours to view it. It was a rental late in the evening and my husband fell asleep, so by the time he went to view it again, it was gone. It almost makes me want to wait for Redbox and only pay a $1 for 24 hrs.  Amazon please do more to make us want to rent movies from you, such as 36 hours to view to start and a slightly lower fee please.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I enjoy this author very much,but it seems that the writing is getting stale. Maybe it's time to retire Harry.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was amazing, sad, but amazing. I would recommend it. However, it was a little depressing for me so I gave it 4 stars.
B000W1V7K4|2.0|I only buy my movies on blu-ray because I want to watch my movies with the highest possible standard of equipment available to the public market. On the blu-ray copy of Oceans's Thirteen it felt as if Rusty had lipstick on the entire length I could bare to watch; low light situations felt as if I was watching \\"A Scanner Darkly\\" in which the characters had this eerie cel-shaded appearance; and worst of all I couldn't bring myself to finish the movie. I only give this a two star rating for the fact that I know the story, acting, and production of this movie was well worth the money but the quality of the blu-ray was an absolute waste of a piece of plastic. Some scenes I could barely make out the characters, and some scenes look phenomenal. Absolutely embarrassing on Warner Brothers, JW Productions, Village Roadshow, or whomever was responsible for making this blu-ray.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I liked this book because it was emotional  but not horrible mAke u cry but made u thankful. I would recommend this book.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I liked the storyline - kindof unique - which is hard to find in today's fantasy novels. I also found the book well written, but i really feel shortchanged - like when you watched the Hobbit or one of the Harry Potters only to find they stopped the movie at half the story. Movie producers are really great at doing this because they want you to buy 2 tickets i guess.<br /><br />i'd like to think for writers its all about telling a story than just selling a book - if you're going to write a series tell a nice chunk of the story - so that at the end of the book the reader feels sort of satisfied. I did not feel satisfied but rather shortchanged. Morgan Rice if you combined 2 of your books and doubled the price i would have still bought it.
B0011Z51QG|5.0|This album is awesome! I like just about every one of the songs. Wish it had contained some of the time and Apollonia's songs. They don't make them like this anymore. Ahead of it's time as a concept album....
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My Zombie Zone is reading without interruption, unable and unwilling to do anything else but finish this book!  Page turner is an understatement.  One of those books that you can't wait to finish but at the same time, you don't want to finish because it's so good.<br /><br />There is suspense, romance, anger, so many feelings.  A definite must read!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|You can do so many crafts, bottle cutting, etc. Make drinking glasses, vases, etc. you name it. Easy to use. Perfect gift for yourself. I love it!!
B009DA74ES|5.0|Happy with my order would purchase again from this vendor. Happy with my order would purchase again from this vendor.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|One of the better Reacher stories did not figure it out till the last,  New to Lee Child's. Work but have enjoyed the first 15 Reacher books.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Since I love Follett's historical epics (The Pillars of the Earth, Fall of Giants, etc) so much and I love thrillers, I figured I should try one of the types of books that originally made him famous.<br /><br />After being disappointed by the last WWII thriller I read (Simon Tolkien's Orders from Berlin), Eye of the Needle was what I'd been looking for! The plot centers around a fictional (but relatively probable) \\"what-if\\" scenario involving the lead-up to the Normandy invasion, which gave the book its historical depth.  It's also a fantastic page turner - with spies, MI5, murder, police work, and a side love story as well.<br /><br />My one small criticism is that I thought the Epilogue was contrived and unnecessary to the story - but you can just stop reading when the regular book ends, so it doesn't end up doing much harm.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.
1400069289|3.0|The author attempts to add appeal to his writing by making it read like a fast action thriller. This may be an attempt to address an ever increasing hunger for entertainment in our society. However, for readers like me - who are hard pressed for time - it is an annoyance to have to wade through 300 pages to get to a 10 page message. The Appendix is the summarizes the book very well.<br /><br />Besides the above caveat the subject is well handled and covers the implications in (sometimes too much) detail. The prescriptions are worth trying and may work in some cases. The starting premise is that one wants to change and believes that change is possible. It seems simple and obvious enough but is not that straightforward in most cases of addiction/strong habit patterns. Conscious acknowledgement of wanting to change and believing in the possibility of change are not good indicators of the uncontrolled impulses that underly our consciousness.<br /><br />But for any, for whom the realization and belief are in the right place, the books recommendations would come across as very useful.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|App is a good challenge.  Fun to play the graphics are great.  Wish there were instructions but stumbling around is fun too.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|The book, &#34;Shadow Kiss&#34; is the perfect middle to this story.  I absolutely will not give you any details but this whole series is excellent!!!!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|So you can play some of it, but then you have to pay to get the rest? Not sure it is worth it....
B001BKVWYG|4.0|After seeing the fantastic documentary of Rodriguez, I bought this DVD  as a gift so I am unable to give it a review.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is such an amazing read! The series just gets better and better too! My husband even read it, and couldn't put it down!!  Must read...
0330345052|5.0|What's not to like about a delightful romp through London, Paris and the south of Italy?  A well crafted book and most enjoyable.
B007712XAU|5.0|wonderful story and charcter study cannot wait for season four and just completed season 3  would recommend most definetly to any one
B00338QENI|3.0|I confess that I skipped over a whole lot of the cell division and endless discussion of the legal aspects compensation to the family.  The rest of my book club loved it.  I didn't.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|the birds are too fat and the pigs look like mice otherwise good but dont pay for  it i luv this game
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love the app, just doesn't know any places that you search for. For example if you search for Yukon,Canada nothing comes up.Other than that everything is great.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I think this book resonated with me because I have felt like there have been times where I have wanted to do the very same thing - pack up and do something wild.<br /><br />The fact that Cheryl didn't come from unlimited resources was also a nice change from other books I've read from a similar vein. That she had to really work to even get to her goal of the hike, then work in a completely different way to get to the next station of her journey.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Its an interesting storytelling style where the entire book the reader only knows what the main character Catniss knows. The narration voice is a little dry as its Catniss's internal voice, but once you get used to it the lack of knowledge of whats going on really adds to the excitement.  Couldn't put it down.
B002BY77CW|2.0|Writing is very juvenile, characters are incredibly blah, one dimensional. The story's not particularly interesting either. Probably would be more fun to read if I was a lot younger, but, sadly, I guess I'm &#34;too old&#34; to enjoy it.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Great show, love all the episodes and am buying the complete series as it comes out so I can re watch them any time I want. Also love the special features, the bloopers are my favorite!
1451626657|4.0|Catch-22 is a story about one man's mission to survive a war and with all the satire to go along with it.<br />This book was entertaining all the way through. There are a lot of characters in the book and I got a bit confused keeping track of who's who. But as the book progressed I got used to all the names.<br /><br />Many saiid it was better the second time around, and this is one that I will definitely read again at some point.<br /><br />Great read
B00338QENI|5.0|I found it very interesting and well writed.  You could she she did research.  I had not hear<br />about the HeLa cells until I read.  I have since looked up about them
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really liked this 2nd book- cannot wait to get the 3rd and see what is going to happen next·
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down!  I was hooked from the beginning, and though the ending is a little hard to take, it was totally worth it. Great for book group discussions!
B00A6L78TY|5.0|YA HE RECIBIDO EL DISCO, HA LLEGADO EN PERFECTAS CONDICIONES Y MUY BIEN EMBALADO, EL TRANSPORTE HA SIDO MUY RAPIDO, EXCELENTE VINILO<br />ESPERO TRABAJAR MAS CON VOSOTROS.<br />MUCHAS GRACIAS POR TODO
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I really enjoyed the book. I was really surprised about this because it is about young lives and I am in my late forties. The book really pulls you in and makes you become a part of it. I did figure the ending out but I would definitely recommend the book to others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should really try this game.it is fantastic .the update is amazing.I love the it so much because instead of being in New York you are in Rio. I recommend you to get it.I think it is an addicting game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is really fun perfect for any child or adult. It is very similar to the first Temple Run but this one in my opinion has better graphics, winding turns, and a giant monkey beast thing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a fresh and unique story. Couldn't put it down. I recommended it for sic-fi lovers everywhere. As I read it I could see the movie in my mind. This story will make a fantastic motion picture series.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Most games bore me rather quickly. This one still holds my interest. There are a great mixture of shapes and colors that are similar enough to be challenging yet not overwhelming
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved all the side stories and the twist at the end. Another refreshing romance with current day relevance.  Thanks Nicholas.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good interactive game for horse lovers especially young girls. Loved it. Excellent graphics as well. Lots of detail in caring for and training horses.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|When I got this game for my daughter, it worked great! And then, after she fed the horse once, it wouldn't  let her feed it again. She could get the first part of seed in, but then, when she went to move it, it wouldn't move to the others. She got really frustrated with it. She spent a lot of her time restarting the tablet and trying other feed. Although, we cleaned the screen the first time. She couldn't  pay for other things, she had spent it all on snacks to feed her horse instead. I felt so bad when she said she couldn't feed it and it had to starve. This &quot;glitch&quot; has to be fixed, an until then, I'm  not going to have her play this game, since the poor horse has to starve.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Sir Anthony Hopkins is transformed as Alfred Hitchcock. He seems to really relish the role. The pacing is solid although a few weak subplots take a little away from the overall package.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Perfect! I'm literally in love with trilogy. I just can't wait to see the movies! This is something you should definitely try to read, you won't be sorry.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|written so that I felt I was there,,could picture everything in my head...couldn't wait to be able to pick it up again and read it,,
B000VZP9G4|5.0|The College Dropout is one of Kanye's best albums along with Late Registration and Graduation in my opinion. My favorite on this album is Through The Wire, definitely worth the purchase.
B008VBYN80|5.0|still new to the game, but so far so good. plus I love this time period :) and you always have something to do!
B008M7JODC|5.0|I had heard about Fringe for awhile before finally checking it out.  I am so glad I did and have since watched the entire run of the series.  It starts a little slow before finding its footing around episode 6 or 7 and being consistently good after that.  The characters and the actors who play them are what make the show so good.  John Noble as Walter Bishop is my favorite but the rest are all solid as well.  If you liked The X-Files, you will like this.
B009MO57H6|5.0|This movie was epic action thought the movie itself and a great ending. Overall I will give it a 5 out 5.
B00005V1B2|5.0|I am so glad I discovered this group! I was already a fan of groups such as Pink Floyd and Genesis, but I wanted to experience more of what Progressive Rock had to offer. Many Prog enthusiasts on the Internet regard this band highly, so I decided to give a listen.<br />For an album without words, the Snow Goose tells an amazing story! The pleasant melodies are incredibly memorable and, although short, transition beautifully to contribute to the larger picture. Latimer's guitar work is emotional and soothing, and shines in songs such as Rhayader Alone and The Snow Goose. Certain sections of the album are upbeat, including Dunkirk, which is incredibly chaotic and aggressive. However, The Snow Goose is largely mellow, and offers a calming atmosphere that provides the listener time to reflect and ponder. Personally, Rhayader is one of my favorite tracks, along with Dunkirk, Sanctuary, and La Princess Perdue.<br />Some people criticize this album for not being as developed as some of Camel's other work, but I still find it a masterpiece. It does stand in contrast to much of Camel's other work, but I find this uniqueness a good aspect. Buy this album and be sure to check out Camel's other work. Mirage and Moonmadness are easily just as amazing.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Intriuging. Thought provoking. If you have a child or someone you love that is accused of murder. How far would you go to defend them? I couldn't put this book down. Heart wrenching.
0062238868|5.0|Loved the book and it was written very well, made it hard to put down. Im not much of a reader and i enjoyed it a lot!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This is an easy read and you can finish this book in a couple of days. After the first chapter, I wanted to put it down, but stubbornly I don't like to abandon a book in hopes that I will get an &#34;aha!&#34; Well, it was a real let down. The whole plot and character developement is unrealistic. Many people I spoke to liked it. I'm glad it only took me a couple of days to read through it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I think this game is really fun and time consuming. which is not completely bad because you can actually see what you have accomplished. a great game to get!
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I am not saying I did not enjoy this book because I did.  However, I personally found the characters hard to relate to, not because  they were sick but because they did not act like typical teenagers.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is just as good as the regular temple run, if not better. It is somewhat the same thing but with a different setting and more objects to collect
B000002G0P|5.0|I can't believe I haven't reviewed this album! It was one of my favorites growing up and that hasn't changed on iota since I became an adult. III Sides to Every Story is one of those odd albums that you can listen to today without feeling like you've entered into a 1990s time warp (not that there's anything wrong with that).<br /><br />Like a lot of people, I wasn't fully aware of Extreme until &#34;More Than Words&#34; was released. That song a huge hit that is still pretty popular, but not entirely indicative of the kind of music Extreme is capable of. Don't get me wrong, it's a great song but it became one of my least favorite Extreme songs once I got my grubby hands on [[ASIN:B000002GJ7 Pornograffitti]]. That album made me a fan and, of course, I couldn't wait to get this album. Since I was a broke teenager when this album was released, I had to wait awhile until Colombia House (gee, remember them?) got this in stock and my dad would allow me to get it (yeah, get that logic!). III Sides is one of those albums I liked instantly. I vividly remember listening to this on my Walkman - on cassette tape no less - endlessly and undoubtedly crying about some teenage dilemma I was in. When I wasn't dwelling on a zit or a boy that didn't like me back, I actually realized what an epic album this truly is.<br /><br />The album, of course, is divided into three &#34;sides&#34;. The first, &#34;Yours&#34;, features songs that are mostly songs about political topics and other social issues. The second side, &#34;Mine&#34;, are more in the vein of love/relationship topics. The third side, &#34;The Truth&#34;, features three epic songs that are basically blended into one long opus. &#34;The Truth&#34; is the standout side for me because all three songs are simply put, beautiful. The first, &#34;Rise and Shine&#34;, is like nothing I had ever heard before or since. It is lush and over the top but not manages to avoid being pretentious. The second, &#34;Am I Ever Gonna Change&#34;, is easily one of my favorite songs on the album. It's the most simple song on that side but the lyrics speak to virtually everyone. It's one of those songs I still listen to when I'm irritated with myself (so yeah, I listen to it frequently!). The final song, &#34;Who Cares&#34;, is another standout that invokes religious imagery and can be interpreted in different ways. I always imagined a video for this being along the lines of &#34;November Rain&#34; in scale and grandeur but alas, no video was ever made.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this album wasn't as massive as it should have been because it was released around the time that grunge music was coming into fashion. All the bands/singers associated with &#34;hair metal&#34; were considered cheesy and silly. While I agree that some of them were, there were a lot of amazing bands and musicians that were tossed aside unfairly. I believe III Sides got good reviews but it didn't sell well for obvious reasons. Bands like Extreme were pretty much considered old hat by MTV at that time so the only place I ever heard this album talked about was in issues of Metal Edge (a Tiger Beat-esque magazine for the hard rock/metal crowd) and maybe Headbanger's Ball. I think MTV played the video for &#34;Stop the World&#34; a whopping five times and pretty much ignored the band after that. It's a pity because Extreme is still one of the greatest bands out there and this album should be all over those &#34;Best Albums Ever&#34; lists.<br /><br />III Sides is one of those rare albums you can put on and listen to from start to finish. I rarely do that with albums because there's always a few clunker songs, but this album has none. The vocals are amazing, the music is amazing and the grabber - there's REAL orchestral music.

B00992CF6W|4.0|1: On creative it gives  you TNT but you don't have anything to explode it with what's the point of having it if you can't use it? 2:You can't make the Nether even though it gives you nether blocks there's no use to them. Other than that I think it's a fun game.

B0088W4YTK|5.0|Excellent acting, great screen presence from all the main players, and excellent story lines. Loved this series and would love to see more like it!
1616550414|5.0|Love it, hard cover, all in color, durable, insightful, covers Zelda origins, chronology and concept art. Super neat and a steal. a Must Have for Zelda fans!
B002OMZTSK|4.0|High school student Russel Middlebrook is not out, but desperate for some honest conversation with other gay kids. After discovering that one of his good friends, Min, is bisexual, Russel suggests they form a club for gay kids at their school. But how do they make sure no one else will join the club? Thus is born the Geography Club, a club so boring-sounding that no one will want to join.<br /><br />I found this novel a heartening story about honesty, friendship, and doing the right thing even when that means risking losing one's social status. This is not so much a coming out novel as it is a novel about how so many kids, gay and straight, are judged and misunderstood by their peers. I loved how Russel developed empathy for other kids in the story.<br /><br />My only complaint with the story is the almost complete absence of adults in it. Teachers were props, parents were non-existent, and the teens seemed to live in a world in which they had complete autonomy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great app. The kids love it & so do I. It is addictive, fun & cute. Great fun for the entire family.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downloaded the last few episodes to watch on a business trip.  Had to &#34;limit&#34; myself to one episode per day to make sure I had an episode to watch on the way home!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a great book.  A mood of insecurity is quickly established in the first two books and the rest of it you are holding your breath regularly because of it.  The end is quite satisfying but there are so many doors unopened that I can't wait to read more.  The production behind the novels seems like this was all done on the cheap making you feel like you have just stumbled onto a treasure that no one else knows about.  I feel Hollywood will be knocking soon.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|This movie was just not that funny to me. I dont if its mark wahlberg, but me and my girlfriend might have laughed a couple times literally.
B0091REZMW|3.0|over complicated. there are a million icons on the screen.  you run out of diamonds pretty quickly and cant continue unless you purchase more with real money.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I'm not giving this 5 stars because I have only tried it. It could rate a 5 if I use it more.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Real good game and storyline.  Makes u really think.  Chose the hard road but it was good cause it made me think harder than I wanted to. Recommend for a good time for sure.  Loved the game.  Recommend it highly. Don't get frustrated just think hard and the hint button really helps you out.<br /><br />.
B00846F1YW|2.0|this app is just a 'get a feeling for' type thing. If you want to play it, you have to pay.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game and graphics.  Has many more game formats than I am capable of handling!  Love the way it &#34;finishes&#34; the game for you when you have won......let's you move on to the next one with out the drill of moving all the remaining cards into the correct column.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I LOVED THE LITTLE I COULD PLAY  THIS. AFTER SUCH FRUSTRATION WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE GAMES DUE TO PROGRAMMING PROBLEM ON THE FREE KINDLE FIRE HD VERSION...I UNINSTALLED IT REGRETTABLY. I DID REINSTALL BEFORE UNINSTALLING PERMANENTLY. IT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. I WISH IT HAD. YOU GO ALONG EXCHANGING FUN DRAWING, THEN NONE APPEAR AGAIN. NO EXPLANATION AND NO WAY TO CONTACT THE OTHER PLAYER.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Enjoyed this one, but didn't think it was a 5 star novel. The character descriptions were done very well, and for a Canadaphile like me, so were the rest of the descriptions.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|classic protagonist challenges in a modern setting, suspenseful with personified layers of textural possibilities. the scope and detailed exposition of bourne's character and the story's historical implications nourished the onlookers hunger for benevolent conclusion of his heroic task.  legacy seemed well directed and edited, with scenes pared down to their crystalline essence.  but my personal preference would have guided me away from that female lead or at least a more diligent reckoning of her acting choices and thus lowered my rating by one star.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Best sitcom on t.v. I used to live near Caltech in Pasadena and the show hilariously recreates this really well.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|quirky cliches and overdone action sequences cannot support unqualified total acceptance of the need for this level of cinematic endeavor
B0047MSLWQ|4.0|This LP is in great shape.  So much in fact that when I recorded it, I didn't bother running it through a tick-and-pop-remover!
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|i really like the core of most james bond movies especially the characteristics of their leading patriotic hero . consider this though in skyfall;  some of the many bad script choices: unnecessary & preposterous shot additions such as female agent knocking off side view mirrors in opening chase sequence. not taking second shot at adversary on train roof. & many other poor story line details exposing the flawed abilities & validity of at least three female roles.  poor supporting acting. thank goodness judi dench was killed in the end, couldnt stand another second of her effete british sarcasm masking an ineffectual character with self indulgent dialogue. saving graces included the over the top but believable role of genius antagonist rodriquez & albert finney's game keeper &fiennes' role as assistant pm.both exhibited these strong parts with well crafted acting. the dark psychological expositions of the 4 worthwhile male roles were excellent.in addition to outstanding stunt work & special effects and the intriguing plot line i would have been prompted to give skyfall 4 stars on its merits but its detraction's are truly troubling.more than 'nuff said!
B009RWRIZ2|4.0|I bought the Blu-ray 2D/3D combo of Wim Wenders' documentary film \\"Pina\\". I've only watched the 2D blu-ray disc.<br /><br />Wenders took Pina Bausch's major pieces such as \\"The Rite of Spring\\",\\"Cafe Mueller\\", cut the performances into fragments, mixed them with old footages, outdoor shootings and dances' comments. From the film, we have some grasp of Pina's everlasting searching for vocabularies of body movements to express human emotions. Some of her expression reach me and touch me, while some are quite bizarre, but I still admire her for her honesty and sincerity. The flow of the film is a smooth one, the images are stunningly beautiful even on a 2D screen. I felt like looking into a dream, it was beautiful, sometimes defied gravity and logic, but it was always fascinating and captivating. Wender, or Pina, mostly use old recordings as music for the performances. The soundtrack is unmistakably nostalgic.<br /><br />I have an extra 3D blu-ray disc. Should I rush out to buy a 3D TV just for this? That is not the choice I would make, as long as the 3D version has the same narration.  Wender turned Pina Bausch's work into a sketchbook. One can find masterful strokes in a renaissance master's sketchbook but that is not the art work in the master's mind.  I highly recommend the blu-ray release of Pina Bausch's  \\"Orpheus & Eurydice\\" that was performed to perfection by the artists at Opéra national de Paris. It is on the vehicle of Gluck's wondrous opera that Pina assembled the bits and pieces of her dreamlike choreography into a masterpiece of her own. THAT is Pina's \\"Mona Lisa\\".
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|could not watch enough of it to intelligently respond. words cannot describe my dissappointment when i pay to see a bad movie

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app.  Works well and handy to have around especially for the kids'  homework. Very easy for everyone to use.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|easy read without having to think too much about anything. 10 more words required to submit, what an idiotic rule.
B004YAS9M8|5.0|I just received this CD as a gift from my daughter who currently lives in Vienna.  I love it!  It's not music for everyone but for those of us who appreciate complex compositions and the sounds that only a grand piano can make, you will find this a pure delight.
B00993FEUK|3.0|The main point of the story is an anti-bully message, but the way it goes about it paints Puritans of old as people who were \\"afraid of what they don't know\\" and made stupid mistakes (by burning witches) is a backwards approach to demonizing judgment. Fact is, no one in the world has natural \\"occultic\\" powers because they were born with it, they focus on doing evil things in order to get that power, it's never forced on somebody against their will by birth (such as your gender or skin color). They are mixing choices that you physically make with attributes that you can't control (like saying who you choose to have sex with is the same as being born blind, you don't choose to not be blind one day or on the same hand are forced to have sex literally all the time). It's a typical liberal minded story that conforms to a growing societal shift in the nation (with the misconception of be more \\"evolved\\" or \\"civilized\\" than before because people are less disciplined on what we do because \\"we don't know, thus we are afraid\\", because we are too stupid and only the 'enlightened' can teach us the way). It's a battle of morality that determines what we consider as okay, and this is an example of mixing something that's bad (bullying) with something that had basis for judgment but warping it to make it seem okay (inhuman \\"magical\\" powers being against ones wishes and claiming historical events prove that whatever happened was wrong because they weren't enlightened to our current way of thinking). A real disconnect and the movie could have made a great monster movie without trying to make the moral the plot and thus trying to shove credibility with historical inaccuracy to make a point.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This app does what it says it will.  I can access and use my computer from my tablet.  There is no where on my computer I can't go with this app.  Great app and free too!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm addicted.  Great sets, beautiful clothes, engaging characters, a little humor, smart and historical plots, and lots and lots of pretentious British accents.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its a excellent game. Very easy to play and addictive. My children invited me to play. There are missions to complete to earn coins to purchase different items. And I like that you can earn items in the \\"mystery boxes\\".
B000002JBG|5.0|I was impressed with the quality of this old item! The music was perfect and the recipient Avery happy with it. I was pleased to find it and very happy with the overall purchase. I would highly recommend this seller! Thanks!
B0094K1K42|3.0|Charlize Theron did a good job being a crazy ex girlfriend. But the story was ok. She goes back to her hometown to try to get her ex who is married and has a newborn.
0375851569|5.0|Nothing gives me more happiness than seeing my kid enjoys reading the books himself.  He was giggling all the way when reading the Green Egg and Ham.
B002GSXJM0|5.0|First of all the music was fresh loud but<br />Very melodic for 1994<br />Everybody was into grunge and to hear<br />Something different but good was refreshing<br />The fact that they decided to reissued<br />This in vinyl makes me even happier<br />Cause is like listening for the first time<br />The way it should it been<br />Every sound is so crisp and precise<br />It gives me chills .
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was the first time I had read a book by Lee Child and the only reason I ordered it was because I had ordered the DVD with Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher and I wanted to read a book about Jack Reacher first. I thourghly enjoyed the book, as did my wife. Now I can't wait to watch the DVD.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Very nice game, you can play for 2 minutes or play for an hour<br />Its good when you are waiting for a meeting
0865478007|5.0|A very important topic of interest to pretty much everyone (whether one is currently aware of it or not) is treated thoroughly enough to be very enlightening, with just the right amount of humor so you don't actually tear your hair out.  Includes very useful insights to help filter information available if you are the type of person who actually tries to find out a little about the risks and potential benefits of what's being prescribed.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I got this to test it out and found that it is a nice simple game. I love horses as does my neice so I know she will love it too.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love Ellen - but this book was nothing like I thought it would be. I thought it would be more about Ellen, but it was mostly just her saying funny things. :-(
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I saw a few of the Dr. Quinn shows on television and knew I had to have the series.  I love it and introduced the show to my granddaughters and they are enjoying it as well.  These shows are great family entertainment and some shows explore actual historical events and weave those events into the story line.  You can't miss with this one.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I've been a day hiker off and on for many years, even backpacked for five days in the Pesatin (spelling?) Wilderness. It is therapy. And so I Loved how honestly she tells this story, the doubt and the surprising confidence that comes from reaching the end of the journey no matter how small your journey seems. She tells of her life before the PCT also with unflinching honesty. The story is well worth your time.
0810983915|5.0|I bought this book for my 6yr old grandson he liked the book and he is reading the whole series
B0076DELIG|3.0|too much gooblegook...........a lot of details and descriptions weren't necessary. Sometimes it is better to leave the extra words out and let one use their imagination.......
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really liked the book. It was a easy read and I couldn't put it down.  Just another great book by Nicholas Sparks. He doesn't disappoint.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book should be required reading for every politician and school child. Its simple and direct way of telling the story make honor a choice, war the tragedy it truly is, and reconciliation a saving grace.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This, as well as the many books Riordan has written, is very good from start to finish. He picks up where you left off on the last book and keeps your attention.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It is a romantic read with unusual lead characters.  Ms. Moyes weaves a very interesting story that made me smile and also brought tears to my eyes.  I loved every minute of it and found it hard to put down. It is definetly not your typical love story.
B00006I53S|3.0|This lens has a great speed and is large enough to shoot in a variety of lighting conditions. It's good enough to use as a walk around lens as it can get to a variety of distances and still produce a good shot. The lens creep on this is horrible though so be prepared and be careful as once you tip that lens down the zoom is going to fall right out to the extended position. I find that I need to keep my hands on the lens while walking around with the cam to keep it from dropping out to the extended position.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|After reading The Fall of Giants, I couldn't wait to read the next in the series.  Mr. Follett doesn't disappoint. The characters become living breathing creatures that you become very attached too.  I am looking forward to the next in the series but it seems there is a bit of a wait for that. The amount of research, Mr Follett does keeps everyting feeling very real and immediate.  These characters could and might have really existed.  I would definetly recommend it.
B001R4BTSU|5.0|beautiful album! great sound from a massively talented artist! I'm looking forward to many more great albums from Melody! Highly recommended!
B004ZNB12O|5.0|I was so happy I purchased this CD!  Pink Floyd has tons of excellent songs and many of them are on this CD.  Have listened over and over.....Buy it you'll love it!
B009X00E18|2.0|I accidentally dropped this while sitting in a sofa and one of the corners broke! The fall was maybe about two feet. My kindle was ok but I thought this case should have been tougher than that. Its now useless after one drop.
B0092MJOMW|5.0|really can't beat this record for shear ferocity.  a true masterpiece.  cannot recommend this record enough.  totally unique and peerless.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this version of minecraft is not as good as Mac or pc but is all-out!!this game has most of the blocks and all of the ores:)red stone is useless and is hard to mine they recently added armor which is a double + this is a must buy game!BUY IT! !!!!
B000H5TVJY|4.0|I am a huge movie buff. When I was younger, I watched this for the first time and wasn't quite sure what was going on. After having read the book and watched it a couple other times, I got all of the subtle undertones in the movies. An excellent thriller to watch if you're OK with sex scenes, bloody murder and drug use.<br /><br />Christian Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman is awesome.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|This movie was very well done. Don't read anything about it or research it before watching. I can guarantee you will enjoy it!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christian Bale does exactly as he has for the last two movies, and that's good. He is a constant in this trilogy, and like any good superhero movie, just when you think he's down, he will get right back up. But like Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, I think what is really worth watching is Tom Hardy putting a different spin on Bane. He's not the mindless minion you say in comic books or cartoons. This is a genius, with a wit and endurance, speed and agility to rival the war-torn batman.<br /><br />Oh, and yes, Liam Neesom is in this as well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it, keeps you busy. Especially if your competitive, you can always try and beat your own score, while your at it collect tons of coins to upgrade your avatar.!!!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Epic. A beautifully constructed combination of new age cinematic technology, excellent acting and tip-of-the-hats to the old Bond movies. I've watched every single Bond multiple times and this one definitely rates at the top. Daniel Craig is quickly rising to the top of the favored Bond list, and Javier Bardem's portrayal of the Bond baddie is superb. A one of a kind and first bad guy that will be remembered.
141659521X|5.0|Really great book from start to finish. If you have never read a Vince Flynn book before I don't know what took you so long. You will not be disappointed with this book. All of his books are worth looking into. Fast paced action from the first page to the last page. had a hard time putting it down at night
B004DMO8U4|5.0|This movie made me laugh more than it did cry. It was so stupid that my girlfriend asked if the movie was actually a comedy, not action and adventure. Plus, it had a lot of references to a comic called Homestuck, which made it ten times more funny.
B006ID8O6K|5.0|Came quick and in one piece.  Great movie.. great service...<br />It would be nice to get this kind of service everywhere you shop.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I read this book while pregnant and adored it. I, like many young moms, feel overwhelmed with the pressure of motherhood these days, with kids speaking Thai at 8 months and becoming concert pianists by 6, there's a lot to contend with. This book put so many things back I perspective for me, while giving me so much good advice. I took notes while I read it! I love the perspective on manners and eating especially. Great for anyone looking for a slightly different perspective on parenting.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|Came quick and in one piece.  Great movie.. great service...<br />It would be nice to get this kind of service everywhere you shop.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book was very enjoyable. It was mystery, romance, and drama all rolled into one. It had a nice amount of history included as well. The novel switches between time periods effortlessly. Easy read.
B003TFUJD6|5.0|Came quick and in one piece.  Great movie.. great service...<br />It would be nice to get this kind of service everywhere you shop.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie? My husband had never seen it (crazy, I know) and we watched it as soon as it arrived. The blu-ray is nice but it is the sweet story that really steals the show.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|Came quick and in one piece.  Great movie.. great service...<br />It would be nice to get this kind of service everywhere you shop.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|Nice to hear a song with vocal achievements, which is to be expected for a Disney theme song.  Mariah Carey delivered the goods on this one, and it's less sappy than the one she and Whitney did.  The song ends with very strong vocals, and the message is simple but on point.  This is one of Mariah's better tracks in recent years.  I look forward to seeing the movie, and very much enjoy listening to this song in the meantime.
B001JAFYFG|5.0|Came quick and in one piece.  Great movie.. great service...<br />It would be nice to get this kind of service everywhere you shop.
B005EY2XFC|4.0|The film itself is good. Dark and atmospheric helps the viewer enter the world which it intended to construct. The Blue-Ray version is nice and the image and sound quality very good. Recommended for customers who like thriller-action type of movies.
B003IMMEKG|5.0|Came quick and in one piece.  Great movie.. great service...<br />It would be nice to get this kind of service everywhere you shop.
B004SIP8SY|5.0|Really a pleasure to watch. I always liked this movie and I also like the way Quentin Tarantino makes his movies. This is no exception and in my opinion this transfer to BD is amazing. Recommended to Kill Bill and Quentin Tarantino's fans.
0345455681|3.0|It is a pretty fair historical novel, but it just didn't measure up to some of Rutherfurd's previous work. To me, it was &#34;stretched out&#34; more than needed.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I wish the ending could have been different. I wanted to see more of how Alex and Katie 's love story unfolded and they get married and rebuild their life together.
B006GECE9Y|3.0|I am happy with it, no issues, yet.  Installed on an Impression 10. It does support Flash,  so I can watch YouTube.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 2 is so much better than than the first! The reader gets to known the characters more in depth and learn how each has their own demons to conquer. Ending keeps the reader wanting more.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I've come late to this show, although I have been intrigued from time to time. Now, finally, I've watched it and I am incredible glad to have done so! I've bought seasons 1-4 and have caught up to S5-Ep-14 on Hulu, and I find the show to be truly complex and fun with just the right touch and injection of slowly budding romance for the romantic soul. The chemistry between Castle and Becket (Caskett - gotta love that!) has only grown through the seasons, and though I have and will continue to enjoy the previous episodes, it is never more fun than now, when they've finally admitted to their feelings for each other. Among witty repartee with the supporting cast of equaling outstanding actors and in depth and surprising crime-fighting and action, there are incredible moments of such sweet tenderness that I find are far too fleeting - and completely unforgettable.<br /><br />Anyone who has watched for this far, will never look at a simple handshake again...<br /><br />Far too many shows lead up to the 'outing' of the main characters emotions for each other and simply end it then, as if that is all there needs to be. The epiphany of love is not an end, it is a beginning, and I truly hope the creators and writers - and the wonderful actors themselves - will continue to show not just how Castle and Beckett have come together, but how they grow together as well.<br /><br />I hope for many more seasons. And I hope this helps anyone who was wondering if Castle is 'worth it.' Take it from me, it is...
B0076DELIG|5.0|I read everything by Michael Connelly and thoroughly enjoyed meeting up with Harry Bosch and all his problems again.  I recommend this book!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|it was really fun until for no reason my high score 1,500,000 went to 0 and I was at x30 but then I was at x1. I didn't do anything to make is happen.
B0021L9ME6|1.0|Well DC once again proving their characters are laffable at best and NO competition for Marvel-This was the WORST thing I've ever seen makes the 70's Hulk and Spidey TV shows look like masterpieces.<br /><br />Maybe DC will get it right someday
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book kept me engauged. The ending was not expected, and worthy of my time invested. I would recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game because it's like Temple Run(which I also did a review on).You use coins to unlock characters, boosts, and power-ups.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I bought this DVD as a gift for a friend who is a fan of Denzel just as I am. I havent bought one for myself yet but the price was 10.00 cheaper than the price in the local Superstores. I have bought DVD's from Amazon before and the quality is always great as I sure this one is as well.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|When I first heard Absolute Zero on the radio I couldn't get the song out of my head. If you like that song, the rest of the album doesn't disappoint.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This was like a soap opera only with characters created in my mind rather than mediocre actors and actresses.  I loved the gravitational pull between Travis and Pigeon.  I also loved the suspense involved with the on again off again relationship.  More romance and passion would have enhanced the novel, plus I was questioning Travis' behavior often. What was going on in his head, what made him tick, why the constant need to live on the wild side?
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The visual and sound quality is excellent.  As well, the plot turns in places which are unexpected (if you haven't read the books).
B000001ESP|5.0|I never thought Rush would be able to top 2112 until they put this out in 1981!  This is such an awesome album!  I'm surprised I didn't wear holes in it from the needle on my turn table, I played it at LEAST once a day for the first year I owned it.  Saw them on this tour at Kemper Arena in Kansas City, MO and to this day still concider it the BEST concert I've ever seen!!  A must for any Rush fan!!
B003YOEXUM|5.0|Not a single weak song on this! The best thing that they've done, and one of the best albums released in the 21st Century.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Magic Mike was a very entertaining and sensual show I enjoyed it very much I give it 5 stars!!!  Very Good!  This is a must see Movie!
B007KB15BA|4.0|Accept once again has produced a fine album. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that &#34;Blood Of The Nations&#34; set the bar so high, that this one is just a hair short. This in no way is to mean that it's not worth the money. &#34;Stalingrad&#34; does not have a bad track, and &#34;Hung Drawn and Quartered&#34; is a fantastic opener. Accept's last two albums are the finest of their career...and two of the best albums released this millennium.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is a great series!  I can't wait to see the 3rd!  I'm glad I have Amazon Prime and was able to watch it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I suppose that if I had the patience I would eventually get to the spicy parts that I've heard it has, but alas my patience wears thin. Another clever English writer, his language is pretty good.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is a great series.  I thought it would be good at best, but I LOVE IT!!  I watched Season 2 the following day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is sooo fun! I love to play it ! but watch out this one is addictive! I love it but its sort of a bad influence.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works slick. The buttons are big and the whole app is easy to use. Very user friendly. I'd recommend it.
B004INNRFK|5.0|Both content and container met expectations....I ordered it for dad, and as far as I can tell he loved it as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay<br /><br />Fun fun fun game<br /><br />Get it its free<br /><br />This game is worth downloading you should get it its very fun you WILL play...
B008OIQYTG|5.0|Looks and sound great...Ordered it for dad, and he loved it. I personally would have been happier if the fact that it comes in Digipack was better outlined...
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|So scary. I looooove this game. It is scarier than the Slender game for the computer!! It's amazing and he says things too!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Interesting, and a bit different take on the &#34;big trip&#34; .  Believeable,  but a little hard to follow at times,  with going back and forth from our perceived realtiy to the reality perceived by the aurthor.<br /><br />Would recommend that the reader be well grounded and maybe even have a little medical knowledge.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I don't really like it. It's all about luck and timing. I only got it to get extra currency for things because it's on everything for a for a deal to get extra stuff.
B009RRIP86|2.0|gave this product five stars when i first received it and put it together.looked good,many compliments.installed 320gig hardrive and smelled that familiar smell that tells you something has fried.burned the hardrive out thought it was the hardrive so 2 weeks a go i tried another hardrive ,it shut my machine off but luckily it restarted ok,another hardrive burned out.there is something wrong with the hot swap back panel so i will disassemble it,run my cables straight to each drive and still have a good looking,not everyone has, bad ass computer.im going to make lemonade out of this lemon.
B00338QENI|4.0|I've read the preview and HELA was an amazing woman and storry.  I have only disappointment in the Amazon purchase that I was unable to transfer my laptop purchase to my kindle.  Any suggestions?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is awesome ,fabulous, and one of the best games I have ever played. I love the idea of this game it's better than temple run 1+2. I really like the power ups and the characters. This amazing game is one I have one on my kindle. I think you should have this thing that gives you super speed for a power up thing.
0765328321|5.0|I loved this book. Reading into the background of the Halo universe is amazing. The book was in good condition and I received the book quickly.
B00004CZN9|5.0|I already own this on VHS wanted a dvd my kids love this movie it is so so so funny
B001ANSSDC|5.0|i normally don't want to see a movie after i read the book, but i can't wait to see the film interpretation of the novel. absolutely entertaining and full of emotion.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I love this game an before this I had never played.<br />Video games use to bore me or I just wasn't interested.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|An enjoyable read tho not one of the best I have read this year.  I think that this book will appeal to others who enjoy the softer side of life.
0670026603|4.0|I liked this book. The main characters were relatable and likable. Despite the serious storyline, there were sections that were funny. Was this the best book I have ever read? No. It was a quick read and it was different from usual romance novels. I appreciated that it was an unconventional love story. I would recommend this to others.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I just discovered Gillian Flynn, and I have to say that this book was well worth the read. The characters are well defined, the writing style crisp and delicious. This book kept me up at night; I just couldn't put it down! What a delight! Gillian Flynn is my new favorite author. You go girl!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|It's exciting an fun to play I wish it was not a game and that I could be one of the characters and experience the fun too it would be beyond fun
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Compelling and wee written better than the cheezy tv series as is true with most books but plot starts feeling more tv ish as it progresses
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was so heart warming and made me thing of things in such a different way. At some points I felt vs for Auggie for not having any friends. I though the graduation graduations funny the way Jack couldn't believe Summer was really pretty.
B00AN0K5KW|4.0|The show itself is marvelous. Definitely seek out the discs or download through iTunes.<br /><br />I'm a long time Amazon Prime member, but I will never buy another Amazon Instant movie or TV show again. I have a new iMac, 40mps internet connection, Netflix Instant, iTunes, and Hulu and NONE of those ever pause or show lower resolution. But I can't even try to watch Game of Thrones Season 2 again, as just watching (or trying to watch) the first two episodes has resulted in the player pausing every few minutes, and then jumping to a different part of the show when I finally get it to resume playback. The pop-out player shows captions that I can't turn off (and looking over the forum threads I'm far from alone in this) and the quality of the stream keep bouncing to very high compression for no good reason. Again, I stream Netflix nearly every day and have yet to encounter a fraction of the problems I'm having with this one program. I've tried multiple browsers, an iPad and my PS3 and none of them resulted in anything but frustration.<br /><br />At this late date, Amazon has no excuse to be so far behind the field, especially when you cannot get a refund for their terrible service. Shame on me for buying the full season upfront.<br /><br />UPDATE: April 4, 2013.<br /><br />Amazon apparently just read my review, contacted me to let me know that there were problems with the show files on their end, refunded my money AND send \\"new copies\\" of Season 2 to my instant account.<br /><br />THIS is how you do customer service. They can't give me back my frustrated weekend, but they can make sure that I'll still be a satisfied Amazon customer, and earn another chance at their service. I've bumped up the review to 4 stars (instead of the original 2) to reflect my satisfaction.  Their response is below:<br /><br />\\"I am sorry that you have had a bad experience with Amazon and streaming our Game of Thrones Season 2 videos from Amazon Instant Video.<br /><br />I am contacting you tolet you know we hear your voice and we are prepared to do something about this horrible viewing experience with us. I have went through and refunded your money for this video seeing as how you were not able to view it at the quality that it should have been at. We pride ourselves on the quality of our videos and we will make sure we do better in getting a video to you with higher quality.<br /><br />It seems that we had issues with the Game of Thrones at the time that you had issues with playing it and it was the file it self which was giving you the errors. We apologize deeply for this issue and I hope you can give us a second chance at making things right.\\"
B0084TWN9K|4.0|I didn't expect a whole lot but was pleasantly surprised by how much I got.  I was occasionally left in mid-air by the end of some of the stories, but maybe that added to the enjoyment.  Some fairly simple subjects kept my attention and my desire to continue reading until there were no more pages.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I like some of the songs. Phillip Phillips is  good singer.  Cant' say anything more. fieve more words required. one word now.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|use plex daily with main windows 7 computer as the server feeding all our laptops and kindle fire to view movies Tv video and pictures. well worth many times the price. far superior to Microsoft video streamer. a must have.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic, fun game. Work great on my Kindle Fire. The action are close to lifelike. Can get lost in time, make sure you nothing else to before playing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun for adults and kids. love it :) it was fun and at the same time it was challenging for the mind!
B008S4YZCO|4.0|this is a game I enjoy playing with my twin grandkids. The fights are not brutally gory so I don't have a problem with that.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|A more reflective and mature Bond but with still all of the action and fun we watch for. Loved it
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|i love me so PLL i watch the show ever day on abc family i enjoy watch it just love it
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|The book was addicting and action packed. Loved it. Being into the series for years and never stopped reading it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app I can add up my golf score card with ease and do lots of other math and the large print is perfect I recommend this calculator
B000MD7OKY|5.0|I would recommend this film to young and old alike. The extras included on the DVD are entertaining as well as informative. pop the corn and enjoy.
1416575464|5.0|I was in love with Domino magazine and was very sad when they were no longer in print.  Once I saw this book I knew it was a must have.  It is not only a good reference for decorating it is also a beautiful coffee table book (which only makes sense).  Very stylish, now, and young!
0345803493|5.0|Can not wait to finish book 3 also! I love how it bringsthe two worlds together,  of vanilla and bdsm.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|So far, am very pleased (have been using it for a few months).  More options than other low-priced graphics apps--and takes a serious approach--not just for cute stuff or finger painting.  Good brushes.  Definite learning curve, but that's necessary with any program of any complexity.  Good selection of brushes, which are very adjustable.  Good that they support layers.  Recommend buying a stylus for detailed work.  I expect to stick with this one.
1439595003|4.0|<a href= http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NLKZUA>City of Ashes (Mortal Instruments 2)</a> is book two of the Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Clare. I enjoyed this book better than the first. I'm over the squeam factor of this forbidden love, but are the mommies and daddies of tweens that will flock to see these movies. It's being touted as the successor to Twilight, I can't wait!    The storyline in this is much crisper to me. This one is more about the story telling whereas the first was about setting up the story and characters. I felt more engaged in this one.    This time around I visited IMDB and found cast photo to help me picture the character. It was a jolly better row, especially envisioning my favorite character from MISFITS as Simon. This novel made me more interested in seeing the movie in the theatre instead of waiting for it on video.    This time around the protagonists amaze me that they accomplish anything. They are easily distracted by their personal problems. They are all one step behind the megalomaniac Lucian Valentine. (damned Underworld everything I read that name I think of [...]) Valentine really should get Worst father of the year award. The man toys with his children like a cat playing with a mouse. You really have no sympathy for this character. By the end of this novel you really are asking how many lives does this character have? He sheds them like snake skin.    The highlight of this novel is the discovery that Jace and Clary are even bigger badasses. I mean, thirty feet, Batman wish he had those ups. It will be interesting to see where Ms. Clare takes these characters; the setup for the next novel, <a href= http://www.amazon.com/dp/1416972250/>City of Glass</a>, already has me hooked.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I read this because my daughter will be reading it in high school and we like to have books in common. It was moving and memorable.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|One joke cannot sustain a movie, no matter how cue the lead, nor how cuddly the gimmick. It is still a one trick pony. Rent it for your um, never mind. Rent it for the one joke....
B004UID2LC|1.0|Horrible app.  Locks up constantly. Glad i did buy it.dont waste your time with this app. It sucks big time. Waste of time
B002DW92SE|4.0|I really like Nick Hornby's writing. His characters are always very vivid and the plot moves quickly.  I wanted the ending to be slightly different.  I also had a bit of a struggle in the beginning as the character of Duncan was such an imbecile.  However, this made very easy to see how Annie felt the way she did.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it.  I have not played Coin Dozer in like 4 or 5 years.  I have no complaints.  They only thing I gotta say is that I had wished I could play it more often, and low and behold, my wish was granted.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time I have it on VHS only so I decided I needed the DVD in my collection,amazon rocks.
B00338QENI|5.0|Amazing life story.  I am familiar with the history, but so interesting to hear the human connection to the research.  Well written.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|it only gives you like 15 minutes to play for minecraft<br />you can play as long as you like but dose not let you<br />have all the building blocks.
B000FAGGWQ|5.0|I have been a star wars fan since my children were little, and now my grand children are watching the films. I own the VHS and now the DVD, so I completed my collection with the bonus disc. It give a pretty good behind the scenes look at the making of and characters in star wars. I wasn't disappointed with it.
B00B7H3OFI|5.0|This is an awesome album that casts the light on a really talented set of musicians. This jazz-funk record is full tight rhythms and melodies. For those who are less than happy that it does not feature Joe Bonamassa in his traditional role of monster of rock blues, the guitar work here is subtle, technical and fitting to the funk genre. With Ron DeJesus and JB on guitar, there is plenty of wizardry. I know there is a ton of 70's funk influences, but to me it seems Joe is channeling Jeff Beck's fusion work. I love the keyboards, bass and drumming. My only criticism is the 4 minute gap on track 9 between New York song and Mr. Clean.
1476712042|5.0|This book had me from the beginning! I couldn't put it down! The characters love interest gets a little intense, but other than that its a wonderful story.
B003E2UQMS|2.0|All masala in the book - from madness, mad love, ball game [bit too much of it], sacrifice, dance  et all. Give another another chance, I will not buy or read this book again. Thanks
0425263908|4.0|I loved the story-line, I just thought there was an over-abundance of sex scenes. It is very similar to 50 Shades of Gray but it does have its own twists and turns. However, it still kept me wanting to read more!
B000002VSN|5.0|Remarkable CD from the beginning to the very end. You can relax sit back and enjoy her voice. Church on any day!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This facebook is now updated, the news feed is updated, this update looks like the one for the ipod, i liked it, all the other reveiws are old. Enjoy the new update!!
1451695195|5.0|This book is excellent. Really confirms one's belief of afterlife. Eben Alexander described his astonishing journey with excellence. A must read.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|So subtle, yet complicated in unexpected ways. Everyday life in a rural English town. Was it so? One would like to believe so at least in our imagination.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Wasn't a big fan of anything to do with zombies but this series is the best I've seen since Sons of Anarchy.
B000022TSY|5.0|Both of my kids love these series of books.  They are at a proper reading level and have great graphic illustration as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. I don't like it because its hard to download texture pack at least for kindle fire.its easy to download Mods though. I still love it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's so much fun I love it when you are looking for the oars I also like killing the monsters at night
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Absolutely love the show! Thought I had seen every episode until I started watching Season 1. Will watch more than once.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|ONE OF MY FAVORITE NICHOLAS SPARKS BOOKS!  VERY WELL WRITTEN BOOK THAT HOLDS YOUR INTEREST THROUGHOUT.  AN ENTERTAINING BOOK THAT HOLDS THE READERS INTEREST.

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I am addicted!!! Cannot get enough of this series, the storylines and characters... HBO could give Hollywood a few pointers!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Yesterday while browsing Amazon, I came upon the summary for A Quest for Heroes (Book #1 in the Sorcerer’s Ring) by Megan Rice. In the Book review, they were comparing this book to Tolkien, but, I guess, every fantasy novel is compared to Tolkien. Nonetheless, I was intrigued. My interest was drawn, so I decided to splurge (whew $2.99) and buy the eBook.<br />Alas, I was a little disappointed. It took me a little while to get used to the writing style of the novel, but I got used to it, and Rice does describe the world that Thor, the main character, lives in beautifully. The plot is fairly simple, but there is still enough that leaves us guessing that draws us in. Who is Thor’s mother? Why is she important—and why does she make Thor important? Is she why Thor’s father hates him? Why does the Queen hate Thor?<br /><br />Rice begins the novel, predictably (or is she just drawing from a fairy tale trope?), with the neglected, ridiculed youngest son Thor as the hero. His greatest wish is to become a soldier in the Legion—to fight for King and Country. After a bumpy start with soldier selection and some shocking discoveries about his magic, he does indeed have his wish granted. Thor makes quite the bad first impression on the legion, but he is helped out by two of the princes and becomes a squire to the greatest soldier in the land! And then he saves said soldier’s life and is rewarded by the king himself! This is where the novel gets a little hokey. Thor has extremely good luck—too good of luck to be believed. I know this is a fantasy novel for young adults, but sometimes I had to stop and say, “Really? That just happened?” This is also how I felt when we learned about the Princess Gwen’s and Thor’s relationship. I know they are going to get together (how else is Thor going to become King?), but Gwen actually annoyed me a little bit. She is really giggly and could be condescending at times. I know she is meant to come off as sweet, but it didn’talways work. I couldn’t see her as the future ruler as the country—the chosen heir, and the love at first site thing is kind of Disney.<br /><br />Despite the sometimes predictability of the novel and the sometimes cringe worthy romantic scenes (and side note: who expects a 14 year old to go to a brothel and enjoy himself some wenches? I mean, really?), I quite enjoyed the novel. I’m a sucker for the cheese, and it did make me smile. I am excited to see how Rice is going to answer my questions from above and to see how she will eventually make Thor the prophesized king of legend.<br /><br />So on to book two…
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Once you begin watching, you'll be hooked and before you know it...you're staying up way too late to watch &#34;just one more to see what happens&#34; - love it!  I recommend ordering some coffee, you'll need it for the next morning before you start your day - but it'll be worth it, get through the day.... Gotta get back to the tv to watch another episode!!  Enjoy!
B00AECDDYY|1.0|I loved the game totally but I was looking for more racing in go carts and come on princess peach is hot<br />I realized you think I'm stupid but come on go carts and bananas that's awesome
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Although I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, especially the throw backs and similarities to past Bond movies, I didn't think there was near enough action ( for a \\"bond \\"movie)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Absolutely love this app. I'm nit even a kid and I think it is super cool. Don't even care what my roommates say. It is SO much fun.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|This is my favorite story.  I've seen different movie and television versions but nothing beats this book.  A true classic.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is addicting and lots of fun. When you get caught, you just say one more chance, but it's never just one more. You will just keep playing again and again.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game<br />And I like that I have friends on Facebook that play blah blah blah blah blah
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Tried quite a few weather apps but eWeather is by far the best. Accurate and always updating to keep you informed. So many features and so much information that I probably only use 10 percent of it. I plan on learning more about how about understanding more of the data it provides. Great app and I highly recommend it.
1933865474|5.0|Bruce Timm provides ample proof in this volume that it isn't how many lines are used to depict a subject, but determining what lines are really necessary and making the most of them. This, of course, is a basic principle of traditional animation, a field in which Timm is well versed, and he does a terrific job of fleshing that principle out—even his use of color follows it, enriching the lines without any attempt at overwrought visual dazzle. As for the subject matter, the degree of naughtiness must be left to each peruser's discrimination, but I don't hesitate for a second to say it's all very nice.
B0094K38KQ|5.0|I enjoy story ; kids love it repeatedly<br />I enjoy story ; kids love it repeatedly<br />I enjoy story ; kids love it repeatedly
B00B2V66VS|5.0|really great game. better than the first. more additions and better upgrades. yes boyyyy. yea. yea. yes yes yes yes no no no no no
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Wow. A great story that will stay with me always, which is the highest compliment I can give a book. Nearly broke my heart, then let it soar. Bella!
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This was definitely on of the creepiest/chilling movies I've seen in recent years. It's not gory or bloody. A true horror movie needs none of that. The story has so many layers. I.e. Elisons relationship with his family, his need to relive his famous past and his willingness to sacrifice anything for it. Ethan hawk is a amazing actor and he delivers in this film. If you liked insidious you will love sinister. i saw this movie in the theater and everyone was jumping out of there seats. II had to watch it again at home.......still scared the s*** out of me!!
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Well written, couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend this book.  Looking forward to reading more from this author.  Give it a read you won't be disappointed.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|I thought this was pretty good. Funny. Very different and very well done. Loved it and would see it again.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Some guidelines are confusing but all in all this game is very addicting and fun! Once I started playing I couldn't stop.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Disappointed with how cheezily the story was executed.  Anna hathaway gave a poor attempt at action scenes and Christian bale is not a good batman. His character voice for batman is poor and not believable.
0385523912|5.0|Although the main headlines about the book lead me to believe it would be a factual exposition of life in North Korea (which it was), the most affecting theme of the book was telling the biographies of amazing individuals who had excaped the North.  The lives of these &#34;ordinary&#34; people reenforced the tragedy humans can inflict on others, but also the adaptabilty and resilience of the human spirit.  The book puts you in touch with a human experience which is at once horrifying, uplifting, and universal.
0547848412|2.0|I spent time in the reading of this story hoping in progression only getting a choice in the end of which story to accept. I choose not to accept it at all and it left a poor taste in my mouth. Glad I didn't go see the movie.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|You will gasp ... often ... the very beginning is a little weird but HANG IN THERE.  So unbelievably awesome!
B00992CF6W|3.0|like the new update but should have more things that u have on computer like the mods like tornado maker and large chests or train tracks<br />?
B008N1V11U|1.0|Extremely difficult to use and a boring game. Help file provided 0 insight  Would not recommend this for anyone.  Also had difficulty figuring out how to get a refund
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I am not a die hard for James Bond movies. In fact I am quite surprised the series has lasted as long as it has. I like a few of the James Bond characters but Daniel Craig is pretty much my favorite of the bunch besides Sean Connery back in the day. The action was good and the story line comes along well. I'm not a movie critic I'm just babbling now but just watch it for yourself and make your own review of the movie.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I really love the Downton Abbey series.  I now have the whole collection.  Sure hope there is going to be a season 4.
B00BESNKB8|3.0|This movie didn't flow too well for me. It almost felt like a 3rd grader had written this movie. Some of the fight scenes were nice, but overall I would save my money and wait til you can watch it for free.
B005VPRF9I|5.0|This was a great product and my son loved it! Thank you so much! It was a great starter kit.
B00B8PQC5S|1.0|Great concept, but the many of the shorts were absolutely terrible.  blood and death with no reason. Pass on it.
B009WJ2XT6|3.0|It's really not a very good sountrack. This mostly had all the background music as well and not the tracks that are more exciting and lively. For $5 it's not bad but if I had the option of buying it again, I wouldn't.
B00BESLT6G|1.0|The effects were good and there were some scary parts, but the lack of a coherent story and terrible delivery of lines was insurmountable.  Catch it on a Sunday afternoon on FX in six months.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|I had to read it again as I had said to my daughter that &#34;there is a book they won't be making into a movie&#34; and lo and behold they did.I enjoyed it more the second time and am looking forward to the movie.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use this with my Kindle and the access was incredible.  When I first accessed this program I felt like I was using my laptop no the Kindle pad... Who New (smile)
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I really enjoy this app cause I now get to enjoy more features on my kindle with great quality I highly recommend it.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I thought this short story was a rehash of some of his other books except in this iteration the threat was an alien instead of a clown, a demon, a low person,etc. Overall disappointing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this app. It has great features and is fun to play for hours and hours so I highly recommend it.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Firefly... shame there was just the one season.<br />Serenity does give the series closure, so you want to make sure you watch that too.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Love this game worth seven bucks. Its only 0.98 gigs which is not really that much space. Good job gameloft!
0670023329|5.0|I won't say much as I am still stunned and sad about this poor man and how his life has been lived. I received my copy yesterday, opened it and couldn't put it down until I was finished.<br /><br />This is a very brave and tough man to have escaped his hell. Unfortunately for him and others like him, he can never truly understand how to live comfortably in freedom, as he was trained from birth to be fearful and suspicious of everyone.<br /><br />Although it makes me look at my own little problems and tell myself how grateful I am be where I am. Something has to be done about the North Korean lives. A chapter discusses how South Koreans are much more interested in getting ahead and making more and more money rather than their people in the north. I do realize taking in all North Koreans would destroy the South Korean economy but are they the only people on this planet who would be willing to help? I doubt it.<br /><br />Read this book. I often wonder what would have become of people like the gentleman depicted in this book had he had a normal upbringing. It's frightening how many people in this world want nothing more than to make others miserable.<br /><br />Six stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|After many weeks of friends begging me to try it, I finally got Subway Surfer. And contrary to my<br />original thoughts, it isn't a complete clone of Temple Run. I had a lot of fun jumping from train to train, soaring through the air, and dodging policemen. The music was great, the graphics are neat and inspired, and I kept going back for more. All in all, I give it five stars!
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Emeli Sande is a wonderful singer with a talent for telling a story in a soulful and gentle way. This album is my favorite R&B/Pop album I purchased in the last year. I look forward to her next one!
B009CF7JDU|5.0|great movie-made me laugh a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I had seen the movie before but I enjoyed watching it just as much the second time!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a good game. This game is good for any age group, and it's fun. This game is good because it's even free.
B00BHMF578|3.0|I think I was greatly influenced by all the awards the film won and I was expecting a truly great movie. I was underwhelmed. I actually struggling to stay interested in the film. I'm old enough to remember the actual tension of the events of the hostage taking. i never felt the movie created the tension and fear of the time. I can agree with the academy not nominating Affleck for the directing Oscar. His effort was mediocre at best.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved this series!! Although this book was a little slow when it came to action it picked up towards the end
B00BETX5PS|4.0|The swagger of 007 was evident in this film. My only criticism is the lack of character development which is true of most films today.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go back and see films with Cary Grant, Kirk Douglass , Clark Gable, James Cagney, Katherine Hepburn and other great actors of the 40's through the 60's. and you'll see what's lacking in today's films.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great app. Really fun to play but it  can be addictive. Colors and .patterns are great.I'll probably order the paid version in order to get more games.
B0037NVM1I|4.0|As corny as Arnold is, the Terminator films were entertaining. and worth watching just for the campy story line and the great science fiction effects.

B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Liked this movie, but not as much as the original.  Maybe I'm too big a fan of Arnold, but his version just seems more interesting.  Still, you aren't driving to the theater, and shelling out $8-$12/ ticket, so thanks Amazon!
B004NS710C|4.0|In Tony Scott's third straight feature starring Denzel Washington, he takes a look at an incident that occurred 3 years prior in Ohio. The event was nowhere near the magnitude seen in Unstoppable, but it defiantly put lives at risk, and put people to the test. The story follows an incident with a runaway train and the two men who risk everything to save lives from it's dangerous cargo. Washington is terrific as always, thriving in these unsung hero roles. Chris Pine, the virtual newcomer who  plays the rookie, on his first day of work, is also really good and shows the potential for a strong film career. While it's not going to surprise or shock anyone, Unstoppable was fast paced, visually impactful, and very entertaining.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A good ending to a very good series.<br />Can't wait for the next movie in the series to come out.
B004LRVFX4|2.0|I hate vampire movies and the whole concept of vampires in general, but I had to see this movie based on the strong buzz it was getting. Based on an award winning Swedish film, Let Me In, tells the story of a lonely 12 yrs old kid who is befriended by a vampire, who moves in next door. Chloe Moretz was amazing as Abby, following her role in Kick-Ass, this girl is definitely going places. I didn't like Abby much thou. I found her very manipulative, not to mention how creepy it is that an ageless vampire, who looks like a little girl, is hooking up with a 12 yrs old kid. While the critics loved this film, I saw it as a dark, slower, more gory version of Twilight, except with younger kids. To be honest with you, the whole thing kind of just weirded me out.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|held my interest and though author did a good job of illustrating the panic, fear and disbelief when core values are questioned---should be a great movie!
B0054SMID0|4.0|The Lincoln Lawyer is based on the best selling novel by Michael Connelly and he isn't the typical lawyer you've seen portrayed in every John Grisham/Law & Order wannabe. Matthew McConaughey is great as Mick Haller. This guy is unbelievably smart, charming, and refreshing. McConaughey takes the brains from a Time To Kill, throws in the swagger of Sahara, and adds in the stellar writing of Connelly, (who mixes old school wit and modern ideals), to create a character that is easily the best of his career. It honestly seems to me like the role was written for McConaughey, it is that good of a match. Ryan Phillippe plays Haller's client in the film and continues to blossom from the shy southern boy in White Squall to a guy who will one day be a major player in Hollywood. It's hard to review a film like this without spoilers, all I can tell you is this. The Lincoln Lawyer is one of the smartest movies I've seen in a long time. The writing is phenomenal, the acting is top notch, and in a slow year for movies, this is a hidden gem!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I had seen Les Mis on stage twice and also the film. I decided to read the book. While it is excellent in &#34;filling in the gaps&#34; and giving continuity to the characters, the interplay of the characters, and explanation of the plot, Victor auto also used this as an opportunity to give extensive social commentary on current day (1860) French politics, religion, and social justice. While this was interesting, it got overwhelming about 400 pages in, actually disrupting the flow of the story. I made it through, but it took me three weeks of hard reading.
B004EPZ06G|4.0|The Hangover Part II tries so hard to be exactly like the first that it leaves nothing to the imagination and has no surprises what so ever! Don't get me wrong, the movie is great, it still has all its laugh out loud one liners, and of course Alan. What Part II doesn't have is originality. With a sequel, we want to see the same characters we love, in a similar, but different story. This movie parallels the original to the point where they are uttering the same lines in the same situation, just in another city. If you saw the first one, while watching this one, you're going to know where they go and what happens next. They have a great thing here with a ton of chemistry between the actors, but what they need to do is take it to the next level. I hear they have hired a screenwriter for a third chapter, let's hope they keep the laughter and change the story!
0525952926|5.0|I was looking forward to reading this book and I was not disappointed. I recommend it to any Follett fans.
B001E7EONC|4.0|The Bank Job is a good movie based on the legendary 1971 London bank heist. While I enjoyed the fast paced action this film offers, it jumps around so much and so fast, that it's pretty hard to keep up with. I found myself quite confused at many different points in the film, especially at the end, when I had to rewind 3 or 4 times. Jason Statham is far and away the top action star out there today. What's so great about him falling under the radar is that he gets to do what he wants to do, instead of getting stuck with nothing but big budget disasters with no plot. The story behind The Bank Job and what led up to it, who was really involved in, was really interesting and made for a great plot. The constant jumping from place to place made for a confusing film, that while good, wasn't nearly what it should have been.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is amazing. One problem: There is no home button. When I want to exit and then play later I cant because you need to go back home. So when I want to play it wont let me. I have to delete the game and redownload it. I just realized its not worth it.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|I am reviewing Stone Cold first, because it is the first film in a series of seven, chronicling, Robert B. Parker's detective, Jesse Stone. I am however glad that this was not the first movie in the series I'd watched, because to be honest, if I had, I don't think I would have continued on with the other movies. Jesse Stone first appeared in 1997's Night Passage. The book was a huge success and went on to spawn ten other books, four of which were made into movies, and three original movies, co-written by Tom Selleck. Stone Cold is the first movie, but the second book. They did the second one first, because of an event that takes place, pivotal to the life of Stone. It is something newcomers to the series need to know, but it should have been added on to the end of Night Passage instead. If you haven't been reading Jesse Stone for years, like I have, this film is going to confuse you a bit. It's also not the strongest story in the set. Tom Selleck is amazing as always, and shines in a role that seems to be written for him. Playing a Detective is not something he's unfamiliar with and he comes across very strongly in every film. If you want to get into these films, (which I recommend you do), start with Night Passage.

0525478817|2.0|Remember that episode of \\"Seinfeld\\" in which Elaine was ostracized for hating \\"The English Patient\\"?  That's me with this book.  I can understand why some people would love it.  When I first heard the premise, I was like, \\"Two teens with cancer, at least one terminal?  No way!\\" Then some people I respect raved about the book so I decided to give it a try.  It's not so much the teens-dying part that I hate.  It's the pretentious way the characters speak.  If I could go back & rewrite some scenes from my teen-age years with the wisdom & experience I have now, maybe I might sound like the two protagonists.  Then again, I doubt it because I'm not that arrogant.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love my Downton!! Just wish there where more episodes to enjoy. Just one question...Spoiler alert...Why are they killing off main characters? smh

B007CKNX28|5.0|What can I say, I love Jack White's work - all of it.  While this one has a much different sound to it than his previous work, it still has the genius that is Jack.  Raw, emotional and fun lyrics accompanied by his masterful musical skill, he has once more solidified himself as one of the most talented musicians of all time.
0425263916|5.0|If you enjoyed the first book, you'll also enjoy this second book of the trilogy. Far better written than Fifty Shades.  I can't wait for the next book to be released!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|After seeing the movie twice in theaters, this was a 'must' purchase.<br />A well developed plot with multiple layers of social situations and comment, asking the viewer to peel back all of the layers, and think more broadly and deeply .

B0043GN6XU|4.0|Some customers will naturally resist the idea of one of the great tenors of our time attempting one of the more demanding Verdi baritone roles. Although I would personally prefer to hear Boccanegra sung by a genuine baritone, this performance works both musically and dramatically. Placido Domingo is in fine voice at the age of 70 and has always had a rich lower register which he calls on frequently in this performance. Of all the opera performances that I have seen Domingo give on video, this is clearly one of his finest achievements. He sings the role with great warmth, musicality and attention to the dramatic detail. His acting of the part is outstanding and he is always a commanding performer on stage. Marina Poplavskaya is also a star of this performance. She looks wonderful, moves beautifully and sings with great feeling. She is a genuine Verdi diva but never sings louder than she needs to. Ferrucio Furlanetto  had a stellar career and is still one of the great Verdi basses but his voice has clearly seen better days. Nevertheless, he is a compelling  Fiesco and his stagecraft is outstanding. Again, Jonathan Summers shows signs of wear and tear on the voice but he has been a stalwart of the Royal Opera for three decades for good reason. His portrayal of the villain Poalo is intelligent and convincing. Adorno is played by Joseph Calleja who gives an ardent performance. It is a genuine tenor voice well suited to Verdi although the fast vibrato can sometimes give the listener some nervous moments. He rises to the occasion magnificently in Act 3 with the big recitative and aria. The council chamber scene is a huge highlight in this performance as it often is.<br /><br />The orchestra in Simon Boccanegra is not just there to accompany the singers but is an integral part of the drama, almost like a Greek chorus. Verdi experimented with a large variety of orchestral textures and moods which are all brought out beautifully under the baton of Antonio Pappano who, incidentally, provides a short and sweet introduction to each act, not allowing the exclusive backstage footage to interfere with the viewers operatic experience.<br /> The production is economical but very effective. I thought the recurrent theme of writing on the wall was a master stroke.<br />While there are some vocal flaws, there is certainly no bad singing and Domingo's performance is one for the ages. There are better sung performances of Boccanegra but, as a full operatic experience on DVD, I thoroughly recommend it.

B00AW0KHMY|1.0|Walmart will have a combo deal of Part 1 Extended and Part 2 on bluray for $22.96 and DVD combo for $19.96.  Take note that these prices is for their midnight release event on March 2nd.  If you prefer to pre-order, the bluray combo is $24.96 and the DVD combo is $22.96.  It's cheaper and better deal than Amazon.  Check out their weekly ad for 2/24- 3/2 right now.  For the pre-order info, it is on Walmart's main page online.<br /><br />UPDATE (3/3/13):<br />The Walmart exclusive does have the regular special features on the part 2 movie.  Only the part 1 extended edition disc movie does not.  Go to YouTube and type in \\"breaking dawn part 2 bluray\\" on the search and look for the one that says \\"Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 Unboxing Walmart Exclusive BLURAY Extended Edition\\" by LexxExpress.<br /><br />So if you have the original part 1 on bluray already, do not throw it away so you could still have the special features that came with it.

1401324649|2.0|I'm giving this book one star for originality and one is for the funny writing style. Otherwise, it feels like a complete waste of time reading such ridiculous garbage! The story is so totally implausible every step of the way that I am giving up trying to get through it even though it is a Book Club book. I get that the story of this man's life is meant to be a parable. There is just too much internal groaning and eye rolling and exclamations of No Way! for me to be able to enjoy this book.
B002PL8SWY|5.0|This is a great package for a fan of this LP.  I've had this in original vinyl form, and 8-track, and wore them both out.  I was lucky enough to buy this new recently marked down in a record store, so I won't complain about the price too much, but suffice it to say it ain't cheap.  But if you can afford it, can find it, and are already a fan of this recording you'll love the TLC that went into this packaging & booklet and photos.  I can't say the sound is dramatically different than the original, whatever the claims of remixing.  Partly hard to say because I've never had a better HIFI stereo analog system than I do now, so for whatever the reason this sounds great to me.  The box set release is a real treat for the fan who wants to pay for it.  Only complaint would be why not release more concert footage on the DVD?  It must not have been very good footage or surely that would be a DVD release.  The Ike/Tina & BB King stuff is good too, but you probably wouldn't buy this for those sides.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I wasn't sure at first if this book was for me, but that question was easily answered in the first pages of the first chapter.  Chris Kyle shares his life as he trains and is later deployed to Iraq as a Navy SEAL.  The book is written with refreshing honesty and with a tongue in cheek sense of humor.  Kyle writes of his job as a Navy SEAL sniper, of his frustrations with political infighting that put our soldiers at more risk and danger than the Mahdi insurgents intent on killing them.  AMERICAN SNIPER is an honest account of  one man's struggles as a SEAL and also as a husband and father.  This country owes this incredible man the debt of gratitude for his selfless service and the many lives he saved.  A debt of gratitude is also due his wife Taya and his children for tending the home fires when it was never easy or what she wanted to do.  This book chronicles an American Family at its very best.
B00AXVH8KQ|1.0|Ok, so if you like Dylan and the Stones and VU and 60's music in general, you would think you would like this....but beware, these guys steal riffs and voices left and right and you can almost name every little quote in their music. But is it music??? I don't think so.<br />After one listen I absolutely hated it, so please, skip this and go for the real thing.
B00A9T1HUO|1.0|I listened with real disappointment to what appears to be a very popular album. I thought his wonderful vocal range was rigidly held in tight. It was noisy and had a jagged feel to it.  There was no sense of the free flowing musicality I love about his voice and performances.  I was shocked that this was Josh Groban, could not believe he put out this ragged piece of noise that is so totally unlike his previous work.<br /><br />There was never the experience of his letting it all hang out, with all his heart. I just listened to Anthem on another album, which is one of my favorite songs of his, with his heart and soul aflame with his emotion. I will take heart any time over intellect whether music or fiction. I suppose he will need to experiment for some time but I hope he will also return to his origins. Intellect has its place but without heart, it is cold and sterile.<br /><br />Others have written far more erudite reviews of this album, some of which I can agree with and others not.  When a friend told me it has gone platinum, I was astonished.  I had to go back and listen to it a second time and I still don't like it at all.  If I had not had trouble with my browser and had a chance to listen to a sample, I would not have ordered Echoes, much to my sorrow.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love the characters and their quirks. The story lines are unique and creative. A strong female lead; Olivia is a girl you don't mess with.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|There was very good CG special effects. If excessive nudity and filthy language is your thing than you will probably like this movie. I was put off by the unnecessary language and nudity and shut the movie off way before the ending.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|If you loved the original Footloose, you will certainly like the update. All of the same elements are present. The story line feels dated, but then who expects originality in a musical? This movie delivers what you would expect - a good cast, good music and excellent dancing. It's fun and entertaining.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|A good family movie for every one. Lots of color and a cute story line. Your kids will love this one.
B0055D3EFU|2.0|Lame. Lame. Lame.  This was a good concept poorly executed. The paranormal team equipment was laughable as were they. It was believable up to the seance, then jumped the shark. The journey into wraith land was pretty good until Steampunk hell. Then the whole ending was just lame. I expected a better ending for sure... not happy, but better written. I'm sorry I spent almost $10.00 on this stupid movie.

B005LAIHSG|1.0|This movie was, simply put, awful. From the bad acting to the cheesy effects, this movie had nothing going for it. The plot was lame - we've seen the re-dos of too many fairy tales lately. Let's come up with something new, Hollywood. Not even the exceptionally good-looking cast was enough to keep this movie off my \\"worst ever\\" list.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I'm not a big fan of reading two perspectives of the story with alternating chapters.  I wind up skipping half the book and only reading one side of the story.  Half way thru the book it really gets interesting but the ending is terrible. I would have killed off somebody or sent someone to jail.  This is not an ending I would want to live with.

B00004WG2F|4.0|I am always thinking when I watch this movie that Brad Pitt´s character must have really done something bad in his previous life (bad karma) that fate has so many tragedies for one man in store. Edward Zwick is one of my favorite directors when it comes to drama and who can resist a cast that is so superb like the actors in this movie. So the canvas is really big and even when Zwick is painting in very broad strokes the film never let´s you down and always delivers.
0875845851|5.0|My name is Tiffany Stinson and I am a graduate student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  I am a client in the Information Engineering and Management program.  One of my main focuses this semester is Disruptive Innovation and the effects it has in my industry and my career.  I was referred by a co-worker about this particular book.  What caught my attention is that the book was published sixteen years ago during a time where technology was heavily on the rise, but not anywhere near as developed as it is today.  It's almost as if the author predicted what would happen to businesses if technology continued to rise.  This lets readers know that technology can and will play a huge part in the future success of businesses.  Reading this book also encourages companies constantly stay current on all the newest and latest technologies that will soon take over all businesses and their processes.  Most importantly, this book gives readers an insight of how technology can completely drive out even the biggest most successful companies.<br />What I found most frightening is that companies that are extremely successful, attentive to their customers' needs, aware of their competitors, and invest in the newest technologies can still easily fail due to disruptive innovations in the industry.  Companies that face this issue can potentially lose lots of money.  The book gives tons of examples of how disruptive innovations are harmful to companies because they are often easier to use and cheaper.<br /><br />One main point of interest to me is that the author explains how large - successful companies are unable to compete with small startup companies.  He explains that new startups develop a detailed analysis before entering the market and try to find better, more sustainable ways to do the same exact job or produce the same product.  This is one of many main reasons why large companies are failing.  Large companies are becoming complacent and over confident with their success.  Their complacency is causing them to overlook their competitors and new entrants.<br /><br />This book is VERY well written and gives lots of examples of the author's findings.  It is very informative.  Reading this book has helped me to be more aware of my industry and its changes.  It has given me a broad understanding of disruptive innovation and things to be mindful of.  Most importantly, this book has opened my eyes to the seriousness and effects of disruptive innovations. When disruptive innovations affect companies, it immediately begins to effect employees.  I highly recommend this book to working professionals in any technical field, and also executives of companies.  This book has certainly been helpful to be in my current academic coursework.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Unfortunately I saw the film an TV where it was heavily censored, so I´m looking forward to the DVD. I was always a follower of the Old Testament (an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth etc.) and the performance of Gerard Butler was stellar. I found it interesting when Butler insulted the judge and showed her the shortcomings of the US legal system which in my opinion is one of the strongest scenes in the film. When he wreaks havoc (as he said himself in the movie in the biblical sense of the word) noboddy can blame him for doing something wrong and I found myself cheering when one of the hypocrites bit the dust. Still there is some small criticism I have to place here: The ending sucked. I don´t want to spoil it here, but see for yourself. Something different would have been more appropriate.
0761169253|5.0|Austin gets right to the point. His simple ideas for creative thinking and building a career that unleashes your creativity, are right on the money. This book builds confidence in creative people of any age. Great stuff!
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|Let me tell you right from the start: If you are a fan of Romero´s zombie movies keep away from this one. It´s a totally different kind of breed. There is no human flesh munching or ripping humans apart. This film is the story (drama) of a man who desperately tries to find his way in a world gone mad. He is looking for a reason to keep on living in a world that is a living hell. So we follow this man Edward Young (intensely and superbly played by Mark Gibson) on his quest for going on with his life. We feel and suffer with him every step of his way. Castwise it´s always nice to see pros like Dee Wallace, Bill Moseley and Stephen McHattie at work.This film is an exercise in originality storywise and stylewise (especially for a film with a small budget). So thanks guys for giving us something original that rises way above all the mediocre stuff that comes out of Hollywood these days with their uninspired sequels and reimaginings. You feel with every scene that you watch that this film was a labor of love and that everyone was giving his/her best to make this film the masterpiece it is.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|Purchased this as a duo with the original version of Footloose and it's a great one to add to the collection!
B002AT8KCY|4.0|Maybe it was a conscious decision to cast Wolverine as a computer nerd or it is one of the biggest miscastings that ever happened in movie history. Don´t get me wrong, I do like Hugh Jackman a lot, but when he is sitting all pumped up with a biceps like Mr. Schwarzenegger, in front of the PC screens I always have to stop myself from giggling. Enough of the criticism now: The movie is highly entertaining (the hostage sequence in the beginning is something you must have seen to believe it), John Travolta has obviously great fun playing the villain and the movie is always thrilling und does have it´s twists and turns to keep things interersting and exciting.
0425263908|5.0|Had read 50 shades prior to reading this book.  This series was suggested by many people and was not disappointed at all!!!  Can't wait for 3rd book to come out!
B00000JSJC|4.0|Back in the days when certain directors didn't have an Oscar under their belt, you already could see (like in every film of Mrs. Bigelow) that she was in for something great. The script by James Cameron is great and the actors (down to the smallest bit player) are excellent. The Y2K angst seems today a little funny, but back then in 1995 it surely had quite an impact on the audience, still the film holds up pretty well today (especially the social commentary about black and white is unfortunately still relevant to this day) and it was nice to visit a film from my youth (okay I was 23 back then) and a lot of the cast was not so well known like the guys(and girls) are today. Still a feast for your eyes and ears (the soundtrack is great too), so enjoy a blast from the past.
B005ARYEPK|5.0|Bought this as a set with the newest Footloose!  How can you go wrong with a classic and new??  Great condition and no problems with product!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There's not a thing I would change about this book.I enjoyed it more than most other books I've read. I wouldn't put it above looking for Alaska, but still phenomenal.
B00AS1Q93S|2.0|Crazy casting for Reacher... the opposite of him as other reviewers have said.  In particular, the persona and physical appearance were not true Jack Reacher. Reacher is 6 ft 5 inches, blonde, physically fit but slim, blue eyes and not too talkative. The biggest conflict with the sniper novel is the use of cars.  Jack goes by bus or walks miles to get somewhere. Jack usually does not have a change of clothes and carries a toothbrush in his pocket that he uses with water only.  If someone had not been reading the Reacher books, this discrepancy between Cruise and Reacher would not be as bothersome.  Since I have read most of Lee Child's books, I am not anxious to see the Cruise version since I bet I will be disappointed.  James Caravesial (?) would be a better casting for Reacher.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|second best step up movie.  Moose isn't in it, so that automatically sucks.  Great end dance scene, though.  Wish there was more dancing throughout the movie
B003V1WXKU|5.0|Anyone whose image of a scientist is that of a dull, timid nerd is in for a delightful shock. Feynman was a Nobel prize-winning physicist who put almost as much effort into learning how to seduce women as he did understanding quantum mechanics. Whether playing strange native musical instruments in a Brazilian street band, or dining with prostitutes in Las Vegas, Feynman's dedication to experiencing life to the fullest comes through loud and clear. The book is funny, informative, and leaves you at least a little bit envious if you haven't been quite so adventureous.
B0060D11LI|4.0|great dancing in the movie.  Just not as good as the other one's when it comes to characters and story line
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I found it was too repetitive. Each day in the book revolved around multiple sex scenes that took too many pages going into minute detail of each move, thought and feeling. Although I enjoyed the story line I gave up two pages into chapter ten due to yet another detail sex session.<br /><br />I picked it up again a  month later and skimming through the repetitive bits and loved the ending which drove me to buying the third book which I am loving.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|very different for Leo. kinda crazy.  I definitely luved it.  Worth watching over and over again.  I hope I purchaced it instead of renting it!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I found the story line was engaging and hard to put down. The story took unexpected turns that kept me wanting to see what was around the corner. The narrative was clear and described events/ thoughts in detail.<br />I looked forward to the second book.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|TripAdvisor is the best online review system around.  I prefer to use this over books like Frommers or Lonley Planet as it is a true, up to date review, vs. out of dated prints of the guide books.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I love this game. I wish you could get more coins faster. Also have the puzzle peases apear more often.
B001EXE2ZQ|5.0|I've always loved this movie - anything with these two actors has to be good!  This is a great movie - very cute and touching!
1616550414|5.0|So much nostalgia, and very interesting trivia that I'd never known about before. Highly reccomended for anyone who likes to see the groundwork that goes into games design.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This movie is very slow, but worth watching.  Such a touching and moving movie. You will not be sorry you took the time to watch this!
B0063IH60K|1.0|I have played many solitaire games on my desktop with no problems.  This appliocation lacks too many features found in windows.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A serious twist really tossed me, so much so I almost gave up. I'm so glad I kept reading!  I've read most of Grisham's books and this is the favorite.
B004SDEP38|2.0|I have worked with word processors since the first versions on DOS thru Windows.  This is not a good substitute for a good word processor.  Sorry I spent the money to upgrade to premium.
B00459GJUM|5.0|Sure I was disappointed that they eventually cancelled it but gee folks...it's SGU what's not to love? Watch for yourself.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|The upgraded version is better than the free version, but not enough to justify the price. This app is too clumsy to navigate around.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Great game to play star wars in angry birds -- its awesome and a great way to pass the time.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|This is a good movie; it keeps you on your toes.  All of the characters are wonderful actors.  I would purchase again...
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved and hated the characters in this book.  I have read other  books of hers.  Like her writi g.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love this app! It's perfect for me simply because I like to keep notes about a variety of topics and keep them separate.  This allows me to do that without having a dozen paper notebooks, journals, memo pads lying about the house.  You can title the separate notebooks here, give them different covers and paper color and print style.  Whoever thought of this is a genius! I hope they keep updating this version with new features because I will definitely buy them!
B000UR9QGW|4.0|Evil Dead II is much better than Evil Dead.  It leads in to the Army of Darkness very well.  I am very pleased with the movie.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|great suspense movie.  It kept you on the edge of your seat...don't have anything else to say  So thats enough already
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I simply love this show its like a novel you just can't put down, every time I sit down to watch it I end up watching 2-3 episodes , I love how it takes you to another time & place it's very intriguing , exciting show.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have played the entire game through and am playing it again a second time. I just can't put it down!  Nice graphics and works well on my old droid incredible.
0385523912|5.0|This is by far the most comprehensive book about North Korea. The descriptions of daily life are grim indeed, and anyone who cares about human rights should read this.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a very fun game for the kids and with the different levels keeps them at it for a while.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love it great way to pass the time while waiting in a Dr office. A variety of puzzles to choose from.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Not quite up to the standards of Vince Flynn.  Could have much more action from Mitch.  Guess Vince is tired.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic series, but I think the world is already aware of that! I did have some problems with the Prime streaming of it, though. It was working much better when we watched the first season on Netflix. If Amazon is going to have the sole rights for it, it needs to have the technical chops to handle streaming shows without interruption. I'm really hoping it was just a rough night for them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best game ever whoever made this game is awesome I love. this game so so so so so so so so MUCH
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is a very addictive game that works the brain in a fun way.  Good games are rarely free...get this game.
B006903GX8|4.0|For those of us in love with the series, this book is a fun companion to the \\"behind the scenes\\" production of the series, the characters and the history / protocol of life on the estate.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Bar None great music from this once unknown group. And a must have for anyone that has a love for music.
B00A8KJK7G|3.0|Very amusing, entertaining movie, but not for our kids.  Admittedly they are sensitive to scary and suspensful movies and we probably should have read the reviews a little closer.  My daughter, 8, started crying within the first 15 minutes, because Sparky dies.  It went downhill from there.  They found it so miserable to watch that they turned it off and didn't want to watch the last 40 minutes (thank goodness, because that is the scariest part of the movie!).  My husband and I thought it was good.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Again some new excitement in this book, beyond all the sex.  The sexual content is way overdone in all the books but overlooking that I am enjoying the story.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|I LOVE this story!!  This is my favorite book in the series and I have read it a few times.  I can't tell you how much I love both Penelope and Colin.  I don't want to give anything away but let me just say there will be some mysteries solved and you get to another side of the carefree Colin Bridgerton in this story.  Don't miss any of this series but especially not this one.  You will LOVE it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The basic story is very good; there its some excitement (beyond the sex) in this book as well as more details of Greys life.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Really enjoyed this game and it was hard to put down. Good story plot. Challenging but there is a hint button if needed. Took me about 6 hours to beat the game total. Most the search screens were done well. No problems with download or reloading the game.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love these adventure games and I'm a fantasy genre buff so this is perfect. didn't want it to end!
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|I have not used it much but the kids love it.<br />maybe if knew piano better I would like it more.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|One of my all-time favorite films. The English dub is good but there is nothing like watching it in the original with subtitles.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This is great to easly look items up on the go.  It's easy to use and has most of the functionality on the website.<br />GET IT!
B005HEJ2DK|4.0|all star trek movies are worth watching several times over.  all seasons have played without issues other than adobe shock minor problem.  star trek is part of history
B0061S0A64|5.0|This is a fantastic app.  It's a different twist on creating music.  Several musicians I showed this to loved it.<br />I enjoy playing with the limitless combinations.
B0041D843M|5.0|Everyone needs to read this<br />Eye opening<br />Amazing<br />If you care about your health<br />If care about your family<br />If you care about the planet
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Now that the characters are established it's easy to get into the story. Each moment is a roller coaster of emotions and now a spice of danger and intrigue.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great account of what it is like to be an operator on these highly qualified teams doing the near impossible on a daily basis. Extraordinary men who deserve our respect.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I love scary movies but anymore they all seem to be the same theme, until sinister. It's different from any movie I have seen so knowing what's coming next wasn't an issue. I did have a couple things figured out before the end, but it didn't make it any less scary. Some people have complained about the lighting being so dark, it was dark and I found myself yelling at them a couple times to turn the light on.My eyes aren't the greatest but I didn't have a problem it.  I gave it 5 stars because it scared me and that hasn't happened in many years. Thank you Sinister!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series. The family is like mine, some you love, some you hate, and some you can't really decide. Never boring, Downton Abbey leaves you wanting to spend more time with the folks upstairs as well as down. Characters are so real and well rounded. Scenery is breathtaking, and costumes are magnifiicent. Can't wait for next season.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie is very touching and highly enjoyable.  &#34;The island of misfit toys&#34; gets together for adventure, joy and drama as teen in the 90's.  At its core the movie is about fragile open hearts finding their way in the world with the support of family and incredible friends.
0547995660|5.0|This is an awesome book for young adults.  I totally related to the story.  It made me appreciate life more.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I very much enjoyed this...was not sure about watching on the ipad but it worked out great.  I recommend it highly
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Taylor Swift is my daughter's favorite singer. I had a choice of floor seats at her concert for $8,500 a seat or a new CD to complete her collection. I love the CD.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love Temple Run 2 Didn't get to far yet like I did with the original but awesome game and graphics are superior to the original. Love it Thank you for another great app.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|In this day and age of streaming movies and Redbox we have all but stopped buying movies. This one is a particular favorite of my childrens, so, I thought it would be nice to have a copy at home. They like and Dad is a heroe..........for 5 minutes. Still worth it!
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|I expanded my territory twice and edited my base. The next time I log on there is no expansions but the money that I paid for them ( $122,000) is not returned to my account. This has happened twice already. Customer service is a joke so don't bother contacting them as you will get no reply. I am ready to delete the game because of this. It is a good game but many many problems
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is awesome!! I give it a 5 star rating because he carried you from chapter to chapter in suspense.
B0034PJWJ8|3.0|However, I think my memory of the movie is better than the real thing.  Glad I got it and saw it again.  I'm not sure paying for Blu-ray was worth it though.
B003A4IFGY|2.0|I don't what happened to Mr petty with this record. I can see trying something different, as this clearly is different from his other material. The problem is he stinks at making blues music. Go back to the wildflowers sound that your so much better at making, Mr petty.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I saw the movie before and glad I got to see it again.  The movie is scarey, funny, and exciting all together.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a kid but have never owned it, Since I bought it Ive seen it twice and will most likely watch it a ton more times.  this is my favorite Disney movie of all time and I would recommend it to everyone.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Keeps the same standard of Seasons 1 and 2.  I am hoping to have season 4  made as soon as possible.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Season One of HBO's &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; gave us lots of great characters, plot twists and, for those who had not read the books, a shocking execution of one of the lead characters. Season Two is equally complex with new characters added and old ones more fully developed. While not completely true to the GRR Martin series, the plot line is close enough to not cause serious fans of the series any undue heartburn. So, fire up the TV / Computer and don't be surprised if you burn through these episodes much faster than you had intended. It's great TV.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I read the 1st Percy Jackson series which I loved! This was no different, very addicting! Glad to see I've got lots more to read
B00979CS50|3.0|Hard rock.  Neil Young is one of my favorite artiest. I'm surprised that has he ages he does such heavy rock.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|It isn't very often that I turn off a movie and walk away before it has ended but this movie was deserving of such behavior.  Damn you Michael Bay for killing my childhood memories about Transformers.  I believed that you were sincere when apologizing for the previous embarrassment that netted you a lot of money and wanted to believe that this movie would be better.  No, it wasn't.  Where is your pride?  Better yet, where is your soul.  Wait, I can see it circling the drain ready to disappear forever.  I will never watch any of your movies again and hope the same for others. you. sick. bastard.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Thought this game was well worth the time.  This game flowed good and told a good story. definetaly recommend playing it
B008XG1X18|1.0|I had problems getting singed in and after I did I realized I have no interest in the content on the pages
B009R8DJ72|5.0|My boy son (10 y.o.) enjoyed the book a lot. There is a queue of 6 weeks in his school's library for this particular book so the Kindle version was just the right thing!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Clean good funny addictive television.  Watched as a family every Sunday night.  The very best that television has to offer.
B000CCBCAS|5.0|It is great, Love the movie, Who would not love this movie? Hugh Grant was great. John Hanna was amazeing!!!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|If you need a super tough, waterproof, slim case this is the one for you. You will have to sacrifice some volume because of the waterproof mic. Easy to install and the touch screen still works flawlessly.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I like it a lot. It is slightly addicting and can become a great time-waster! Has that silly music in the background -- I could do without that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a addicting game that is really fun.  I just got it and i cant stop playing it.  It is the best. :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Too much blood and gore, but love the story about survival and the rotating role of leadership.  Also watched Survivor on the BBC, similar theme minus the zombies.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautifully written with a touching plot.  I like the narration tactics and the ending was perfectly scripted. Highly recommended to all!
B000FC12C8|5.0|Reading the book help me to decide where to invest, and where not. Know yourself as an investor makes the diference.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I wouldn't recommend this book for younger readers. But this is a great book for young adults (age 11-18) I loved this book because it shows that our world is pretty close to down right perfect!
B000FA5STS|4.0|Good read  lots of suspense  as expected...  All His books seem to be 4 strs etc<br />I would recommend  it.
B0086700CM|4.0|this is fun mindless entertainment. you don't have to pay too much attention and each run doesn't last too long.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Awesome game. I enjoy every level it provides as well as the colors and artifacts it shows. I recommend it to everyone.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I could not put this book down this is one of my #1 books and i have read a TON of books. Jamie McGuire is a genius and i am patiently waiting for Walking Disaster!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Recently, the app has been acting up. It works at speeds 10x faster than it should, and the screen wobbles when it does. Also, my items that I am using often switch without me doing anything and occasionally they \\"unpurchase\\" and I am forced to spend more coins to buy them again.<br /><br />Edit: Finally fixed the glitches! Now that I can properly enjoy the game, I can properly review it.<br /><br />Pros: Good 2D graphics, great colors, good sounds, fantastic power-ups and upgrades, does not require you to pay money whatsoever.<br /><br />Cons: Limited upgrades and challenges.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this. It's fun, entertaining, and will kelp you busy for hours. The upgrades they do have are just wonderful and the challenges--though limited and often repeated--are fun. Best of all, this app is so well-made that you are not required to spend any money to level-up (though if you are worried your child will spend like crazy on this app, you can set the parental controls to require you to enter a password of your choosing before you purchase anything app-related).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is a genius. Like seriously I read Slammed and Point of Retreat they were AMAZING I didnt even read what Hopeless was about before i bought it. There was no need i knew i would LOVE whatever this book was about. She has a knack for bringing the emotion out of a book and Hopeless was no difference. I was angry, happy, and so terribly sad. I cannot wait for what she comes up with next. READ THIS BOOK YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy challenging myself and trying to beat my own times.  quite a strange manor.  reminds me of playing an altered version of Clue
1476715904|5.0|So amazing. I came across this by accident and it has been one of the best books i have bought! I will read anything Colleen Hoover writes because she is just that good. READ you will not be disappointed at all!!!!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I'm so glad to add this CD to my collection.  Her voice is wonderful and it's so exciting to hear<br />and to also know of her rise in the music industry.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Dr. Viktor Frankl weaves the story of his concentration camp experiences in a masterful look into the soul of man.  The first section of this book is his recounting of his experiences.  The later sections delve into his concepts of logotherapy and psychoanalysis.  While the later sections would have never been a topic of interest to me, provided with the backdrop of his camp experiences, I thought it provided an interesting peek into that area study.  Well worth the read!  Highly recommend for anyone searching for life's purposes and explanations.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|It's so funt o be able to watch a good film with my young granddaughters. Brave is excellent and it<br />leads to interesting conversations with my 5 year old and 2 year old granddaughters.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I like super men. I like for the hero to be big and tough and always get the girl and always win.
B00846F1YW|1.0|I could never get past the intro screen and it wouldn't let me click on any buttons.  The screen looked like it everything was in the wrong place, so never actually got to play it.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Too much description not enough action. I like Jack but I feel cheated because too much non action. I don't need to know so much about boring information.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Amazing price, amazing movies.  There is nothing else I can really say about it.  This was the best christmas present I received for this price.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Too much jumping from past to present and from he said/did to she said/did. Not an enjoyable read, don't waste your money.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I got really into it, and of course at that moment is when they want you to buy it.  if i played more video games i would.
081243238X|4.0|The book looked a little frayed around the edges like it was used. I ordered a new one.<br />It was a gift. I didn't have time to get anoher so I gave it anyway.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I didn't understand the whole angry birds phenomenon.  One day i was bored and downloaded it, it was an addiction at first sight.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The updates from this game are super. There are a lot of things you can find here that you can't in other games.
B007REV4YI|5.0|&#34;M&#34; has always held a special place in Bond's heart. If you have been a fan of Daniel Craig as 007 you would emphatically know this. I was so surprised at the ending (I just couldn't believe it. The story line blind sides you at the conclusion).<br /><br />  The action and violence are teeth rattling. The traitor is a slimy &#34;GIT.&#34; You want to reach out and choke this cruel mindless killer. Better take something to put between your teeth so you don't break them from clinching your jaws. Try to stay loose...remember it is only a movie (keep telling yourself that as you watch the hearing scense's in the courtroom). That's the way to do it &#34;M.&#34;<br /><br />  This is a watch a couple of times movie (as are all the Daniel Craig films).
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This is my kind of movie. It was scary in parts familiar in some areas like you had seen this from another movie.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|Being a Airborne Combat Soldier...I was totally into the free fall... I forgot it was a movie for moments there and almost had to change my pants. This had it all;  Suspence, Action, and great locations and continuity of the story line. Craig is amazing actor. Again, The best of the best of the 007's.
1419705849|5.0|Bought this book for my grandson, he loved it. I dont know what else to say about it. I didnt read it
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game! Though it's a bit like temple run... but I still love playing because there is no tilt so I can play in bed
B009KHDT0C|3.0|It wasnt as good as I thought it was going to be.. I actually didnt even sit through the whole movie so you know what that means
B0097EWK3A|4.0|good spooky story and challenging puzzles.  I was stumped on several occasions.  I did have a few issues with the kindle touch screen working as it should but only once or twice in the entire game. if you like solving mysteries I would recommend giving. this game a try.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|If ever there was a movie to give you a needed lift, this is the one. Ted isn't the sweet quiet type though. He is loud and often obnoxious 'kind of funny.' Great ending, too.
B00AG6Z92C|2.0|I was not aware that this CD music was sung in Italian.  I so enjoy listening to his amazing voice, but I was sorry it was not in English.  He could be singing about taking out the trash, but with his voice and the flowing Italian words ... he sounds romantic.  I will be more careful in ordering another time.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This moive had too much of a spin on a classic for my taste. It strayed way too far from what we ever grew up knowing about Snow White. My husband liked it though.
B003L77G38|5.0|Season three is by far the most exciting.  I bought seasons 2 thru 4 planning to watch an episode a night but have managed to complete seasons 2 and  3 in 3 weeks, it's that addicting!  Love the multiple story lines and the thought provoking science behind the stories.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. I love this. I play it a lot. It can be strange, but it is great.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|enjoyed it but some hidden objects impossible to find without hint. wish it were a little more interactive but you just find an object and use it. nice timewaster if you have nothing else to do.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book has met giggling and laughing the whole way through, with the excel portion of the sex scenes. It's fun and good for Sunday's lazy afternoons.<br /><br />Kat

B00BESM14U|4.0|I watched this movie with my hubby and kids last night. It was good, but - alright call me old-fashioned - I found it a little hard to digest a high school freshman hanging with seniors who were hanging with college kids. (I also found it more than a little disconcerting that my daughter knew what LSD was, but I digress). After I got over that, the story line was good and that acting was fine. I'd suggest keeping this movie for high schoolers and above; I thought it was a little to old for my middle schooler.
B008NEVP1S|5.0|Aimee puts out another great album with this collection on Charmer. Not as long as some of her earlier work - 11 tracks. And overall length is a little shorter than some. But Aimee has given us another great album with this set. Definitely worth it!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|We heard this was funny and rented it. After about ten minutes, we decided we had better things to do than watch a bong-hitting bear (or whatever you do with bongs!) say 4-letter words. My recommendation: skip it.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|It is the most boring thing to look at. I do not like it at all like you. Hate it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0321701763|2.0|The books has some good point, but fell short of my expectations. If you buy used be sure to get the CD that comes with the new book. Book provides some screen shots but not enough so you are left searching for where you need to click to begin an operation. The book has the reader practice on some photos provided on the CD, however does not explain what you are adjusting.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Is a very nice layout and summary of news... your 5 min news digest of the day.  Customizable sections, tried already 2 or 3 and this is the best so far.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was a great sequel to the first and keep you guessing the whole way. .. little slow in the middle but then things certainly picked up later on. ... .. I'm already on the 3rd book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|really makes you use your brain to solve each puzzle. start on easy, then gets more difficult. more and more colors.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is better than the first one and if I could cuss I would say this game is @&#%#&* awesome... as said by 12 year old child
B0085YNML2|5.0|so much fun. but does get more challenging as you go along. the little chameleon is so cute with his little tongue move.
B0000UJFCO|5.0|I was impressed.<br />Missed Rick Wakeman but the orchestra sounded great with them. It was great to see themplay &#34;Ritual&#34;.
B003VPOXAE|5.0|I've been an avid reader for most of my 45ish years, and can't believe that it took a divorce (after 20 years of marriage) to get me to read this wonderful book.  But the fact is that so many of the women I've been meeting mention this as one of their all-time favorites that I figured I should read it: also, it is a legal thriller of sorts, and I love legal thrillers.  Well, I read it, and I loved it.  The eyes of a child are the window through which we see the events unfold in this tale, and that child's viewpoint is honest, open, and innocent.  The town comes alive, as do all of the characters, and you start to feel as though you're also part of the town.  This novel will have you laughing, crying, and tug at your heart-strings.  I no sooner put it down then started to reread the first chapter, this time picking up nuances I missed the first time.<br /><br />Truly a book whose hype does not exceeds its content.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Joe was kickass. His band is top knotch and back him perfectly.  I would have watched it go on for at least 10 more songs.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Bad piggies is a great game that is challenging at times but not impossible to complete. There are new levels on the paid version but not yet on the free version soon though hopefully.
B00280LYIM|4.0|Another great book.  Lots of twists and turns...and things I didn't see coming.  I love when I don't have the twist figured out.<br /><br />There were a couple of typos in the Kindle Edition, but not many and not distracting.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Simply a magnificent story.  Despite the serious themes woven throughout, I was thoroughly entertained and captivated by this story.  What impressed me the most is that through the theatre of Jojo's mind, I was completely uplifted by this book.  Other accomplished writers (that I will not mention here) write beautifully but I find myself depressed and unable to read dramatic material for months afterward.  Not so here.  I understand that this will become a film via MGM which seems a natural - It MUST take place in Britain with a British cast to ensure that the production will treat this properly.  If done well... it will be a MAGNIFICENT film.<br />I'm looking forward to reading more of Jojo Moyes' books.  Where have I been????
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Highly recommended, a few misspelled words here and there, but an overall positive experience. This would make a great movie!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Hotel Transylvania was a really great movie I enjoyed the different point of views that it had and also the way it showed not to be scared of someone because they're different I would not hesitate to buy this movie

B003XT603Q|4.0|Great read - first book I've read by this author. First book I've read set in Japan. Glad I downloaded it and looking forward to exploring more with this author.
B00B0NEH8C|5.0|It's been a long time that a band was able to come out with a song that totally rocked 20 some what yrs after their first album. It just goes to show how great this band is. CLUTCH will leave a impression in the music world and stand out as one of the greatest Rock bands in the history of music. Earth Rocker just kicks butt and ROCKSSSSS!
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|How could anyone not want to listen to James Taylor sing christmas music?  I highly recommned this CD to all.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|I loved Django Unchained and I knew that I had to buy the soundtrack. Always loved and respected Quentin Tarantino's taste in music. A nice mix of old and new. And i loved that the older songs are from his own records, where you can hear the cracks and pops of the vinyl.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had a hard time &#34;buying into&#34; the character.  It was not my favorite book, but I would not not recommend it to my book group.  Maybe with the discussion, I would get more enjoyment from the reading experience.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|Was not particularly well written, the story not particularly interesting, the subject, which had tremendous exploration potential not developed, characters flat, story line a cliche.

B003JTHXOK|1.0|The first few chapters were very good, but then it  became boring and long :-( I hate the ending !!
0439023491|5.0|Great book!!! Keeps you reading and hard to put down. I really enjoyed this book. Look forward to reading the next book! Very happy with my purchase.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This is by far one of the best seasons in the series to date. With the introduction of new characters and the rocky ups and downs of the current cast, it makes for a very funny and interesting show. This is currently one of my favorite shows and I cannot wait to buy season 5.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Mental illness is a difficult subject, especially in a movie for young people. This movie does a decent job with it without getting too deep. The flashbacks are very important for the story line, but I found them hard to follow a couple of times. It appeared that something important to those scenes was missing and likely edited out.
B009YQJ322|5.0|This movie was far better then the one they did in the 90's.The actor playing DREDD kept his helmet on at all times which if you read the comic books you know that.He's given an assignment by the chief justice to see recuit is able to be A judge,and the reason for dredd getting her is not clear not even at the end.
B0002KZAKS|4.0|I bought this the last minute for a party and was used by many people as well as myself.  Sturdy and good sound.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|whenever it updates it doesn't update the whole thing such as the hourly part and the ten day. overall this is a really good app. much better than goweather and accuweather and the other weather apps
B0088O11NU|3.0|To be fair to the program, I could give it 5 stars, but stuck with 3 merely because it didn't interest me.  I like puzzles, but not this kind.  I played a few and got bored.  If you are into the labyrinth style puzzle, you will love this.  It works like it should.
B00127RAJY|2.0|Any CONSISTENT exercise, especially for someone who does not already exercise much, will make you lose weight.  For this reason, doing this video for 30 days straight would certainly make people lose weight and get stronger.  However, for a person to stay fit for good, a person needs to exercise not just for 30 days, but for a lifetime, and this video would not encourage me to do that.<br /><br />Every step of the way, Michaels urges viewers to do her workout so that they can \\"change\\" their bodies.  She continually points to her two assistants, women who are very muscular and who have very little body fat, and says things like: \\"Look at her abs.  You want abs like that?  Do this exercise.\\"  Or: \\"See that crease above her butt?  Hot, right?  If you want that, do this exercise.\\"<br /><br />But these are lies, and they're harmful lies.  Will your body \\"change\\" from doing this workout video for 30 days?  Sure, sort of.  You'll lose some weight.  You'll gain some muscle.  But it will still be YOUR body.  You and I will never have that woman's abs or that other woman's butt crease, regardless of how much exercise or dieting we do.  Can we have stronger abs/butts than we currently do, with less fat on them?  Sure.  But they will still be our abs and our butts.<br /><br />In level 3 of this video, Michaels says, \\"If you've been doing this for 30 days, you should already be feeling that six-pack.\\"  Um, maybe if you already had one before you began her video regimen?  Let me tell you something.  I was a Division I college athlete for four years.  I ran 50 miles a week.  I did 9 minutes of abs with no rest every single day.  And ladies and gentlemen, I never had a six-pack.  Never.  Not once.  And that \\"pouch\\" at the bottom of your stomach that Michaels assures you her workout will help you get rid of?  Even at my fittest, I always had it.  Why?  Because that's how my body was designed.  And you know what else?  I'm FINE with that.  I love my body.  I don't need a six-pack tolove my body and to be beautiful, and neither do you.<br /><br />If you're looking for a way to get in shape and stay motivated to work out past 30 days, find something that's fun to do and that makes you feel good about yourself.  Michaels will not make you feel good about yourself, and her workout is not particularly fun, or even convenient.  First of all, the workout requires hand weights.  Most people do not already have hand weights in all of the different sizes that would be necessary to reflect the gains in strength that they would make over time, so this is an added expense/inconvenience.  Michaels also relies on standard, run-of-the-mill exercises like push-ups, sit-ups, and jumping jacks, so that even hardcore workers-outers will not be particularly inspired by her.  I was able to do all three levels back to back, and all I got from it was pissed off.<br /><br />Her view of exercise is that the only reason you would want to be doing it would be to get \\"hot.\\"  She insists that pain is gain and that the harder you work, the more attractive you'll get.  Though this could be effective motivation in the short term (let's say, for 30 days), it's not sustainable in the long run.  I would highly advise the beginners among you to find a more positive instructor who doesn't make false promises and encourage you to dislike your body (try Juliane Arney), and the advanced workers-outers among you to find a more challenging video, also with a more positive instructor who doesn't make false promises and encourage you to dislike your body.  (I don't particularly like Billy Blanks's style of instruction, but his advanced Tae-Bo workouts kill me.  I've also heard good things about the challenge level of P90-X, though I've never done it, and it does look expensive.)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is Truth. You  can feel the author's sincerity. I read Betty Eadies book and had the same amazing feeling. Betty`s book seemed more simplistic and Eben Alexander`s extremely detailed, however they both \\"hit a homerun\\". Thank you.
B000IOM0X8|5.0|I loved the book and they put a nice spin on the book in the movie.  I think the quality is fine, transfer looks great.  I have no complaints!

B002NXSRX4|5.0|I'm not sure why people don't like this more than they do.  It's G.I. Joe!  It's supposed to be outlandish with cheesy lines and bad chemistry ;)  That's what makes it fun haha!  It's definitely worth the price to enjoy this movie a few times!

B00AJRKR3Y|5.0|with today's music industry the complete joke that it is, how could one possibly not give this work less than 5 stars? heck, i'd give it ten stars just because you don't know ahead of time what the chord structures and progressions are going to be. this is musical evolution as it was intended to be. great compositions performed and recorded by great musicians! yes this is what the music industry was intended to be before corporate glut got ahold of it!!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Will Robie is an interesting character, and this story kept me reading. Lots of twists and turns kept me guessing and kept the story from being predictable.

B0089TGJ18|5.0|This is about the best and coolest blu ray set I have ever seen. Here's why:<br /><br />Pros<br />1. All movies are all on blu ray, certified with the best quality assurance<br />2. The movies are clearer than I can remember them. I've seen the VHS editions a lot of times.<br />3. The sound is top notch. A lot of the time I had to turn the volume down<br />4. The approx. 6 hours of bonus features are priceless. They have all the bonus features from the DVD editions plus brand new ones that cover the production of all four movies<br />5. The trinkets if you can't see from the pictures include:<br />A. Condensed version of The Lost Journal of Indiana Jones<br />B. Five production pictures<br />C. A book of matches from Club Obi Wan<br />D. Film cell from Indy's encounter with the cobra<br />E. Two tickets to the Zepplin from Last Crusade<br />F. Ticket to the Pan Am Clipper in Raiders<br />G.

B006LSZECO|2.0|&#34;Everyone&#34; was reading this Best seller novel so I  decided to read it. Both characters were whiney and self centered. Neither of them did I find sympathetic, so I didn't take sides.  It was like sitting with a not quite best friend and listening to their angst for hours. Exhausting and not satisfying.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|The final snowman defies credibility.  Illogical and physically impossible.  With possible villains eliminated, things became predictable.  Otherwise, a wild ride.
0316067938|5.0|I love Twilight so this book was a great book for me. I seen the movies first so I have a face to put with the stories from the book which made it so great. The book is more in depth than the movie. If you are not a reader, this is not for you.
0765350386|5.0|[...]    There's something about fantasy books that puts them on a whole other level of excitement and wonder. It could be the diverse cast of characters who are heroic yet human, or maybe it's the sheer scale of the world crafted by the author, limited only by his or her imagination. Whatever it is, when I picked up \\"The Final Empire\\", book one of the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\", I knew I was in for an undeniably thrilling adventure.    For a thousand years, the ash fell. It fell over the Skaa slaved in misery and fear, over the Lord Ruler who reigns with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. The Lord Ruler is God in the Final Empire, the prophesied hero who conquered the Deepness millennia ago. Yet somehow hope survives. A new kind of uprising is being planned, one that depends on the cunning of Kelsier, a brilliant criminal mastermind, and on the courage of the unlikely heroine Vin, a Skaa street urchin who must learn to master Allomancy, the power of a Mistborn. Together, the crew seeks to do what has been impossible for centuries: bring down the Lord Ruler and rid the Final Empire of evil.    What I almost always love the most about any epic fantasy novel are the characters. They are, without fail, always diverse, each with their own distinct personalities and stories. First, you have Kelsier, the legendary Survivor of Hathsin, who never fails to wear his signature smile and jaunty air, but harbours something dark and bitter within. His bravery and single-minded determination to defeat the Lord Ruler, as well as his power as one of the few Mistborn, are what drives him on his plans for the uprising. But he's also more than that. Kelsier is an incredibly complex character with layers upon layers of emotion and vulnerability, which he tries to hide under the facade of a foolhardy, carefree leader. Ms. Sanderson reminds us that ultimately, the greatest of heroes are humans with troubles and flaws like us, and Kelsier is the perfect hero to show us this.And then you have Vin, a Skaa orphan who's been taught that trust is never real, that everyone, no matter how much you love them, will betray you in the end. As the second protagonist of the novel, Vin undergoes an important change as the story progresses, and it's really interesting to follow her as she grows from a wary, scarred street urchin to a more confident, trusting Mistborn. The relationships in her life play a huge role in her transformation. Kelsier is her mentor who not only teachers her Allomancy, but also teaches her the more important lesson that sometimes, trust and love won't betray you. The crew, with Breeze, Dockson, Ham and Sazed, also help her realize this, and it was really the dynamics between the group that I really enjoyed reading and even almost feeling. And of course, there's Elend Venture, the handsome heir of the most powerful noble house, who, very, very obviously, she finds herself falling for. Being a crazy romantic, I pretty much require that every book has to have some romance in it, and I loved how Mr. Sanderson wove in this thread of love between Vin and Elend.    Another extremely important element of epic fantasy books is the magic. I'm not talking about wand-waving, sparkly, bibbidi-bobbidi-boo magic. No, the magic in \\"The Final Empire\\" comes in the form of Allomancy, the power that Mistborns and Mistings possess. I found the concept of each of the metals being connected with a skill incredibly unique and fascinating. For example, burning pewter enhances your physical abilities, while burning iron allows you to Pull on nearby metals. Ms. Sanderson has obviously put in a lot of thought into creating this completely new type of magic (though now the word sounds slightly childish to describe something like Allomancy!), with considerations of the laws of physics and nature. Crafting new, unique powers in fantasy novels is certainly a daunting task for any author, but Mr. Sanderson has definitely done a wonderful job with introducing the world of Allomancy to his readers.    The plot of \\"The Final Empire\\" was a journey unto itself. Admittedly, there were some drawn-out, possibly unnecessary parts, as many epic fantasy stories are wont to have, but the novel remained fast-paced and compelling throughout. It also means that there's ample time and space for character development and world building, and I think Mr. Sanderson has taken advantage of this to create an immersive place for the readers to be in. The pace especially picked up towards the end, where so many things happened that I couldn't believe my eyes, and the twists and turns in the plot were just crazy!    Overall, 'The Final Empire\\" is an incredibly exciting, compelling first installment to what promises to be an equally exhilarating trilogy. The camaraderie between the members of the crew and the other relationships in the novel bring human elements to an otherworldly land of Allomancy and Mistborns, and the plot never drops. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who loves a good adventure or seeks an escape into a totally immersive, new world. I will definitely be reading the next two books in the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\" to see how everything plays out!    Rating: 5/5
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its something to do that's fun and easy to figure out. my favorite game is the soccer ball one. this game has almost no ads that pop up. the best part is its free. u only buy games with points which u earn from the games. some r more challenging than others.

B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|For those of us who have read the book I feel Peter Jackson did a near perfect job of capturing the spirit of what Mr Tolkien had written. The Hobbit has a lighter, more adventuresome feel to it, compared to The Lord of the Rings and this is how it should be. It is a master piece, the best film of 2012.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was purely awesome! If you like realistic future, this is a really good book for you. Keep in mind, it does have some graphic violence in it, so I would recommend it for maybe mature 11 year olds to 15

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a splendid and important book.  Its author is a long-practicing neurosurgeon who is a former faculty member of the Harvard Medical School.  A few years ago, he suffered an e-coli infection that developed into meningitis, attacking his brain, leaving him comatose—without consciousness or a functioning brain—for a week, and quite nearly killing him.  Against great odds (100 to 1 or worse in his view), he has recovered completely, and written this book.<br /><br />The book concerns his illness, the reality he quite vividly and consciously experienced while nearly brain dead, and conclusions he has reached concerning God and reality based on his experiences.  Before his illness, the author practiced as an academically inclined neurosurgeon.  He considered himself a scientist as well as a practicing physician, and his views about reality and God reflected his training and his career.  He saw reality as consisting of things that could be perceived with the senses, either directly or indirectly using machines and instruments.  In his view, reality began and ended with the physical world and the observed physical reality of our galaxy and the greater universe.  Notably he did not see consciousness as existing independently from this physical reality—instead, it was an artifact of physical brain structure and brain chemistry.  Although I don’t believe that he expressly stated that he believed God did not exist, it is pretty clear that he didn’t view God as being a part of this observable physical reality, and the book seems to indicate that, regardless of his belief in God, matters spiritual and religious did not play a big part in his life nor attract much of his attention.<br /><br />During his illness, and while his brain (at least the higher level parts responsible for consciousness, congition, personality, memory, etc.) was completely non-functional, he experienced a new reality of great beauty, wonder and peace, the most vivid aspect of which he describes as being pervasive, unconditional love.  When he recovered consciousness and in the months following his recovery, he sought to apply his scientific training and experience to understanding what he experienced.<br /><br />He has concluded that consciousness exists independently of the physical brain and that, freed from limitations resulting from our limited sensory abilities (seeing, hearing, touching, etc.) and from the limited processing power of the human brain, his consciousness was able to perceive a much greater, multidimensional reality—the heaven of the book’s title.<br /><br />Though he is obviously a bit frustrated by limitations on the concepts we can express using human language (after all, a language that, while quite useful and apt in dealing with the limited reality of our physical world, was not developed for use in connection with the greater reality he experienced nor for expressing his expanded perceptions of that reality) his book does a very good job describing that reality.  His writing also reflects a certain intellectual rigor and scientific analysis, and I am compelled to give greater weight and credence to his descriptions and conclusions in view of his scientific approach as well as the relative unimportance of the spiritual component of his life before he developed meningitis.<br /><br />This book will be food for thought for me for a long time.  I recommend it without reservation.<br /><br />Tom Hurley

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|It has a great opening, good story throughout, great close!  Everyone loved it 17-55yo.  Would watch it a second time even.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|An outstanding novel. For most of us, WWI is forgotten history. It was that time, however, that forged the realities that led to WWII and the Cold War, the historical events that still define much of our current era. Ken Follet brings that period of 20th century to palpable life and succeeds in telling us about it more than twenty history books put together. It is a testament to the author's skills to make us feel entertained while we are getting educated at the same time.
1592407889|1.0|This book is the most  unbelievable .fabricated peice of crap i have ever read ,these stories just keep getting more bizarre as the book progresses .Save your money on this one
0375703764|2.0|I had high hopes for this book, there is certainly enough hype surrounding it. While I did enjoy the main story taking place within the house and the struggles of the family, I did not think the sub plot with Johnny Truant was interesting or even necessary. Johnny likes to hook up with random girls and do drugs and that's about it. He starts to go a bit mad and blames it on the book but there is a history of scitzophrenia in his family which is most likely the real culprit. Johnny also likes to ramble incessantly about s*** that no one cares about. There were many times when I wanted to skip large sections of his ramblings but managed to resist. There are footnotes on every page and they are excessive to say the least. Many times one footnote will go on for an entire chapter. Most of them reference authors and magazines that don't exist in the form of a pseudo review of a film that also doesn't exist. If you want to read a book that uses footnotes to enrich a story rather than befuddle it in order to make it seem cool then read A Brief Wonderous Life of Oscar Wao. But if you want to read a book that's up its own ass with how \\"cool\\" it's trying to be than read House of Leaves.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|No class, no fun, not even easy entertainment. Stupidest college movie ever made, not even the love story works. And the rest of the story is dull and completely predictable.
B000K29CEI|2.0|You get what you pay for.  Short Circuit was $7 to buy vs $3 to rent, so I paid the extra $4 to have in my Amazon library.  Other movies I have ordered have been excellent quality.  This one is very low resolution and not full-size.  Even when I zoomed on my TV, it did not fill the screen.  My 6 year old son liked the movie anyway, but my wife and I mostly cringed at the mediocre script and incredibly dated music and hair styles.  The language was very crude for a family movie.  No f-bombs, but lots of shxx, axx, damn and hells.  The movie is a light PG but the language alone pushes it into R territory.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|This is one of the best &#34;time travel&#34; based movies I've ever seen. The acting and the storyline are both superb. I am amazed that this movie didn't get any &#34;Oscar love&#34;.
B009J2VMXY|3.0|Except for the bonus Cd containing a traversal of the Violin Concerto, played by its dedicatee, Samuel Dushkin, with Stravinsky at the podium of the Lamoureux Concert Orchestra in 1935, this huge set contains 38 recordings of Stravinsky's seminal work, but not a single one conducted by the composer himself. Nor is this the only serious omission.<br /><br />As detailed below, the set contains a wealth of interpretations across several decades, from many conductors and musicians, leading ensembles from around the world, and offering a variety of different versions of the score:<br /><br />Eduard van Beinum, Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, [1921 version; recorded in 1946]<br />Ernest Ansermet,  L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande [1921 version; recorded in 1950]<br />Ferenc Fricsay, RIAS Symphonie-Orchester Berlin [1947 version; recorded in 1954]<br />Antal Dorati, Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra [recorded in 1954]<br />Ernest Ansermet, L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande [1921 version; recorded in 1957]<br />Rudolf Albert, Orchestre des cento soli [recorded in 1956]<br />Pierre Monteux, Paris Conservatoire Orchestra [recorded in 1956]<br />Antal Dorati, Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra [1947 version; recorded in 1959]<br />Herbert von Karajan, Berliner Philharmoniker [1947 version; recorded in 1963]<br />Colin Davis, London Symphony Orchestra [recorded in 1963]<br />Zubin Mehta, Los Angeles Philharmonic [recorded in 1969]<br />Michael Tilson Thomas, Boston Symphony Orchestra [1947 version; recorded in 1972]<br />Bernard Haitink, London Philharmonic Orchestra [recorded in 1973]<br />Erich Leinsdorf, London Philharmonic Orchestra [1921 version; recorded in 1974]<br />Lorin Maazel, Wiener Philharmoniker [1921 version; recorded in 1974]<br />Sir Georg Solti, Chicago Symphony Orchestra [recorded in 1974]<br />Claudio Abbado, London Symphony Orchestra [1947 version; recorded in 1975]<br />Colin Davis, Concertgebouw Orchestra [recorded in 1976]<br />Herbert von Karajan, Berliner Philharmoniker [1947 version; recorded in 1977]<br />Simon Rattle, National Youth Orchestra [1913 version; recorded in 1978]<br />Seiji Ozawa, Boston Symphony Orchestra [recorded in 1979]<br />Antal Dorati, Detroit Symphony Orchestra [recorded in 1981]<br />Leonard Bernstein, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra [1913 version; recorded in 1982]<br />Charles Dutoit, Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal [1921 version; recorded in 1984]<br />Riccardo Chailly, The Cleveland Orchestra [1947 version; recorded in 1985]<br />Pierre Boulez, The Cleveland Orchestra [1947 version; recorded in 1991]<br />Sir Georg Solti, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra [recorded in 1991]<br />James Levine, The MET Orchestra [1947 version; recorded in 1992]<br />Vladimir Ashkenazy, Deutsches Sinfonie-Orchester, Berlin [1947 version; recorded in 1994]<br />Semyon Bychkov, Orchestre de Paris [recorded in 1995]<br />Bernard Haitink, Berliner Philharmoniker [1947 version; recorded in 1995]<br />Valery Gergiev , Kirov Orchestra, St Petersburg [1947 version; recorded in 1999]<br />Esa-Pekka Salonen, Los Angeles Philharmonic [1947 version; recorded in 2006]<br />Myung-Whun Chung , Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France [1947 version; recorded in 2007]<br />Gustavo Dudamel, Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela [1947 version; recorded in 2010]<br />Bracha Eden & Alexander Tamir [1913 version for two pianos; recorded in 1968]<br />Guher & Suher Pekinel [1913 version for two pianos; recorded in 1983]<br />Vladimir Ashkenazy & Andrei Gavrilov [1913 version for two pianos; recorded in 1990]<br /><br />What it lacks, for me, however, is any apparent reasoning behind what the compilers of this massive set have chosen to include and exclude, beyond what they were able to license at the time the set went into print.<br /><br />We are given three recordings of the 1913 version for two pianos, and two recordings each by Colin Davis and Sir Georg Solti, but only the last of three recordings by Bernstein, when Bernstein's 1958 NYP recording (about which the composer is reported to have exclaimed \\"Wow!\\") is not only currently unavailable except as an import from Italy, but also offers a much more interesting contrast to his late recording than the contrasting recordings by Davis or Solti offered in this set.<br /><br />Other duplications are easier to understand. Ansermet was a friend of the composer and Dorati always found something new in this score. It is also interesting to hear Karajan's second thoughts contrasted with the 1963 recording, which had elicited such scorn from the composer - he described one of the movements under Karajan's baton as proceeding under a \\"tempo di hoochie coochie\\".<br /><br />It is a pity that although the conductor who led the work's premiere is present, Pierre Monteux is not granted at least one more recording from earlier in his career, when he was a much younger and healthier man. Monteux and the composer both recorded the work in 1929, and Stokowski recorded a fine performance of the work for 78s in 1930. Sound is, of course, a limitation in all of these very early recordings, but it is hard to believe room was not found for at least one of them when so much room is found for recordings from the last 20 years, let alone three performances of the same edition for two pianos.<br /><br />In addition to these, where are any of the famous recordings by Igor Markevitch, Boulez's less-clinical recording of the work with the Orchestra of the ORTF in 1963, Ozawa's livelier recording from Chicago, etc., etc., etc.?<br /><br />Another significant omission is the celebrated paired recording of Stravinsky's pianola recording alongside Benjamin Zander and the Boston Philharmonic following the same tempi (which differ from the written score). The IMP/Carlton disc pairing the pianola and orchestral recordings, long out of print, was hailed far and wide as one of the most significant musical events of the year in which it appeared, and it continued to garnerpraise as long as it continued to remain in print.<br /><br />Granted that Decca could not obtain the rights to every Rite ever recorded, this presentation would not be so frustrating if the set did not contain so many recordings that it gives the false impression of being more representative of the work's recording history than it is.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|And have been continually interested in books about near death experiences.  However there always is a lingering trace of doubt based on current scientific dogma that these experiences are really just manifestations of the brain.  This book by one of the most reputable neurosurgeons in the world Presents a scenario where the most accepted view of why NDE's cannot be true are completely wrong.  In the situation described by the author there has to be another explanation -- and that explanation is that there exists a dimension that is completely real and that cannot be explained by our current definition of what is and is not real.  The Fact that after such a dramatic physical illness the author is able to communicate completely and authentically in medical terminology about describing his complete recovery is itself a miracle, and completely convincing.

B001AITGWE|3.0|Douglas was great in this movie. But his character should have been better established at the beginning of the film.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Better than the previous Craig &#34;Bond&#34; movies, it had it's moments and it had potential, but it was hurt by some ludicrous plot elements and sequences.<br /><br />Like all the new Hollywood blockbusters, it was &#34;action hero&#34; from top to bottom, and as expected it was entertaining at times and absurd at times. Intelligent suspense and drama has been replaced with said &#34;action heroes&#34; and visual shock and awe. Obviously I’m in the minority, but I prefer the “Patriot Games” or &#34;Ronin&#34; approach....i.e. very plausible and still gripping.<br /><br />This being a Bond movie, plausibility is not a consideration, nevertheless, this got farcical on occasion, even for Bond standards.<br />Skyfall is no smarter than its many Hollywood action movie cousins, but it is visually stronger, so much stronger in fact that it makes the movie seem better than it actually is.<br /><br />Bond movies are known for their evil and flamboyant villains, and this one applies the same formula, but without success. Nothwithstanding Bardem's fine performance, his character is rather stale. It resembles the villain we’ve seen in a thousand other movies, Bond or otherwise, and his main action sequences are eye-rolling.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the &#34;visuals&#34; are the strengths of this movie:  1. the introductory sequence (you know, the video collage where Bond walks across the screen and turns suddenly to shoot, and then the images, mostly of women, float up and down the screen while the evocative music plays and the credits run) is enthralling ..... better than the movie.<br />2. The setting and cinematography are outstanding. The views of Hong Kong and London are excellent and stunning. Great stuff.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I came across this book while pretty actively engaged in another. Amazon recommended it based on a previous purchase. After reading several reviews, I opted to read the sample. Just a few minutes in and I was hooked. I felt compelled to buy the book and stop what I had been reading to keep reading this one. The majority of the book is written in first person and you really get the feeling the main character is talking directly to you. Honestly, I could envision myself right there with him as he struggled to overcome every obstacle. Imagine MacGyver and Survivorman melded into one character: Mark Watney. How likely would I be to recommend this book to a friend...about the same recommendation as making sure there is toilet paper in a public stall before getting down to business! Its entertaining and laugh out loud funny. Just buy it!

I bought this book because it was an Amazon daily Best Buy. The reviews are what sold me on this book.like I said this is not my normal read. Once I started reading had I could not put it down. It is a long book but once you start you just can't seem to quit. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thriller. The fact that I am leaving a review over what is basically a chick book amazes even myself. This was and very good read and worth every page. I may even read more by this author. It was a very pleasant surprise. If an old redneck like me can enjoy this book, anyone might. what else can I say, it was a bargain, I enjoyed every minute. Fred T

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|As someone who has read A LOT of books on a number of different topics in IT over the course of my career, I can tell you first hand that they are for the most part boring. Reading them feels like work and unless you're really interested in the topic, it feels forced. This book couldn't possibly be farther from your typical tech book.<br /><br />I've been wanting to learn more about the world of DevOps, Lean IT, Continuos Deployment/Integration, for a while now and I'm quite glad that I waited for this book to be released.  It was able to cover a ton of great info and roll it in to an attention grabbing story that is so true to life that anyone who has ever worked in corporate IT could surely relate.<br /><br />Also, a hidden bonus, and one of my favorite features of the book is all of the included references to real life resources to help you to continue your education on the topics covered in the book.<br /><br />Great job by the authors and I would like to sincerely thank them for not writing just another tech book.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|This book is sometimes difficult to follow but always keeps you coming back.  You need a scorecard to keep all the characters straight as mystery piles upon mystery, but once you understand them all you get pulled into their magical world.  At times it feels like a trip with Alice to Wonderland, trying to figure out the message of each new &#34;tent&#34; and other times it feels like a tragic love story.  Very imaginative writing but still leaves questions unanswered.

B0092ZEIN4|2.0|I'm always for giving a new product a chance. I wasn't about to order it online but as luck would have it, I happened across one at the local Walmart I work. I picked it up and gave it a shot.<br /><br />I use a Nexus 7 tablet and was surprised how conveniently it was compact into a small case with both the controller and a kickstand for the tablet. It felt awkward at first but I very quickly got used to it and it was truly a joy to use!<br /><br />The instructions for pairing it seemed unintuitive but the first time I paired it, I was surprised how quickly it just began working.<br /><br />Then (because of input limitations on Android) I unpaired it to use the keyboard real fast. Of course normally this little inconvenience would have been something I could easily see past. I'm not difficult to please.<br /><br />Unfortunately that's when the trouble began. My Nexus 7 recognized it as a device that could be paired, however it wouldn't pair. I checked the instructions and did everything it said. I even turned everything off, tablet and all, and tried to start from a clean slate. I even tried completely forgetting the controller in the Bluetooth list. Nothing was pairing.<br /><br />I then began looking all over the internet for a solution. Nothing came up. Some posts about Android 4.2 not performing correctly with Bluetooth but an issue supposedly resolved in 4.2.1, seeing as I wasn't having any other Bluetooth related issues.<br /><br />After stumbling upon whole forum posts and reviews of people having then exact problem I was having, with not even so much as a factory reset fixing it, I took the device back.<br /><br />It's a great little accessory... until it completely stops functioning. Not due to bad hardware, but poor software integration. Pity.<br /><br />In short. I'd recommend skipping this until news starts cycling that there's been some sort of fix for this. It's not worth wasting money on until then though, unfortunately.
B009S33I68|5.0|Excellent book it should required reading for all of the politicians who have the ability to commit our country to war.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Although it took me almost two months to read this novel, I greatly enjoyed it. It had many good points and characters, including Ethel and Billy who were my  personal favorites. I look forward to reading the next two books in the series.
1616550414|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Legend Of Zelda series, so naturally I was so excited when this arrived! It explains the entire chronology of Hyrule, and has really cool development art for all of the games... I love it!
B0060Q57JW|3.0|I had ordered this and session 1 was missing the second disc was kinda disappionted . But everything else was still there
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This had a good story line, great graphics, and seemingly endless puzzles. Extra features a nice touch.  Well worth the time and money.
B00628RVV0|3.0|I have never cried so hard during/beacause of a movie like i did this one.<br />you really got an idea of what the camps were like and how so many children lost their lives.... tragic.
B00005N6KG|4.0|like this item.  use them to sleep with white noise.  keep buying as they wear out.  will continue to use the product
B0026IUXME|5.0|I so loved this movie!!!! its emotional, sad but very touching! you felt for them and got a good lookof what it would be like to be a jew at that time.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Great album! Had never heard of this artist until I heard \\"Next To Me\\" on the radio ( it's my favorite! ) All the songs are great and she has a great voice! Highly recommend!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Overall good game fun and everything<br />If never freezes and the graphics are good there is really not anything bad foe me to say about this app
B005P1YCNK|5.0|...to start making changes to positively effect the rest of your life!  An easy read manual on doing simple steps that will result in major successes.
6300215512|5.0|This is one of the all time best film noir movies ever~I am a film noir fan and appreciate how wonderful the old black & white movies were. This one is certainly at the top of my favorite list. You will love this movie~especially if you love the old movies. You will not be disappointed!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game notorious little KIDS. At least the age of six to play this game to understand the tasks that need to be completed to get more gems and money to progress in the game.
B00003CX95|5.0|What can you say about Braveheart.  It makes you wish you were actually there to see the victories and defeats.  I think it's one of Gibson's best.
B008NW67E0|5.0|If you loved the first Mumford and Sons album you will get just as much joy out of this one.  They do not disappoint.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is a very action packed movie.  I took this movie to our cabin last weekend and it was great for a Saturday night viewing.  There were people of all ages, from old to teenage children.  This was acceptable for everyone, a PG-13 rating.  Also I was pleased with Amazon through the ordering process
044661758X|3.0|Book arrived quickly. Packaged nicely. However multiple pages coming loose from books binding. Did not affect ability to read but a pain having to keep putting pages back when turning pages.  Otherwise ok. Love the series of harry bosh.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|after initially installing it, the game failed to load on my kindle fire after the first time I played it. I uninstalled and reinstalled it so hopefully it will work this time because I really enjoyed it. I chose this app after I gave up on Horse Life and its repeated crashing issues.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|don't want to spoil for other readers, but i could not put this book down.  Unexpected.  Suspenseful.  Surprising.  So good.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Maybe wasn't as good as the first Reacher book but if you read one and like it you probably will not hate any of them. They are cut from the same cloth and are easy reads.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My 11 year old and I read the series together.  Then (because it was PG-13), I went and previewed the movie and then took her to see it.  Know your child - it is a disturbing premise, but if it's a project you tackle together, and discuss openly, it can work.  I TRULY appreciated that this was labeled as a &#34;tween&#34; book and didn't have tons of inappropriate sexual situations.  It was pretty tame - just some kissing.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|the animation was extraordinary I was fascinated the story line was good to watch with your children, my mentally disabled sister loved this show she was glued to it the entire time thanks !!
B00AJLHULW|2.0|I was really looking forward to some new Robben Ford music, and this is really disappointing from one of the great guitarists around. Yea he is great live, but he needs to take it to the next level. Maybe he needs to tune into what Joe Bonamassa is doing, now that guy shoots the moon.
B007TNS6JI|2.0|It's a typical Gameloft game,  a shameless clone that pushes a mobile device to its limit, and usually pushes too far. I've started it up 3. times and its crashed twice.<br /><br />I'd probably give it 3 stars but they also tell you to review every time you play, and that sucks. People don't have enough time to make an opinion, the reviews are comparing it to God of War and Skyrim, rediculous.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Kindle fits like a glove in it....also I can see it from across the room! So if someone is using my kindle I can see them
B004FOA84A|2.0|Tried everything with some of the clues - including tips I got off the internet - but something wrong with the program.  Should have sent the game back.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|...I had already viewed it and think it is Meryl Streep's best work, tying with Silkwood.<br /><br />I have not been a big Streep fan, but this was exceptional....way too deep to have been very popular with audiences so it also fits right in to my fascination with little unknown movies that are thrilling but it doesn't fit in that it was up for 5 Academy nominations...has Streep ever made a movie that was NOT up for an Academy award someway?<br /><br />I had very good service in getting this item through Amazon and it was a gift the gifted actually said thank you for and said they enjoyed it.<br /><br />So I love it as the statement says to the right of the 5th star.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good, get me on the edge of my seat the entire book. Can't wait to read book 3. AWESOME
B004SIPAJG|5.0|I already have a copy of it and it is one of my fav no name movies.<br /><br />But for once...the person I gifted it to said it was &#34;hilarious&#34; thus the 5 stars.
0307720950|4.0|Chris Anderson, until recently the Editor-in Chief of Wired magazine, passionately believes in the premise of his latest work, Makers: The New Industrial Revolution. So powerful was his conviction that Anderson traded his prestigious position in publishing for a leadership role in the movement, as CEO of his own \\"makers\\" start-up, 3D Robotics. Makers is a compelling take on the remarkable potential that rests within the do-it-yourself manufacturing movement. Anderson himself is well acquainted with the entrepreneurial DNA of this world of making things, his grandfather was a Swiss emigrant who invented the automatic sprinkler.<br /><br />Makers credibly chronicles the history of creators (makers) in times past. As artisans and craftsmen gave way to the textile factories of eighteenth century England, the \\"Second Industrial Revolution\\" moved beyond steam power to electrification and innovations such as Henry Ford's Model-T assembly line. Anderson is a product of the digital culture, from the advent of personal computers to the amazing capacity of the internet, yet he sees limitations of the Information Age to spawn a \\"Third Industrial Revolution.\\" The critical component in his estimation is a \\"democratizing and amplifying effect on manufacturing\\" (Anderson, 2012, p. 41), which is now taking shape with technologies such as desktop digital fabrication and 3-D printing. Just as Steve Jobs and Apple created the desktop publishing phenomena, desktop fabrication tools and the \\"cloud\\" allow a new generation of artisans to design and manufacture with industrial-quality tools at their fingertips. As one chapter's title suggests, We are all designers now, we might as well get good at it. Anderson suggests the \\"shop\\" class of the future will include 3-D CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and computer-controlled routing, milling, and machining (p. 55).<br /><br />Anderson's personal approach provides great insight into the capacity for community found online, which provides much of thelatent energy to the do-it-yourself movement. The collaborative experience of his own 3-D Robotics effort produced critical design changes and software improvements, only possible in an open hardware and software environment. While this participatory communal approach allows for a free forum of synergy and suggestive improvements to product designs, potential drawbacks to a large scale application begin to emerge. Makers presents a grand vision, but much of Anderson's focus is on small items developed in a \\"hobby\\" like atmosphere, or expensive items such as a personalized kit car. Much of the modern world is heavily dependent on intellectual property protection and the thought of open-source collaboration strikes fear in competitors, and makes corporate attorneys salivate. Even his Tesla example, the production of an innovative electric car,  fails to fit within the model of a collaborative maker approach. Tesla has heavily leveraged government investment to procure high tech robotics in their manufacturing plant yet profitability remains in question, with price per unit very high and production relatively low. Anderson's final chapter is entitled DIY Biology, and attempts to connect the maker movement with future potential in genetic manufacturing. The suggestion that machines may someday replicate organs in a laboratory sounds enticing, but stretches beyond the current science, a fact Anderson acknowledges.<br /><br />These minor critiques aside, Anderson enthusiastically presents a vision for the future possibilities of a movement which may well change the way products are designed, created and marketed. Whether the technically amazing capabilities of this new genre of digital manufacturing tools will indeed be the seeds of a next industrial revolution stands yet to be determined. It is clear however, that the author is \\"all in\\" as a leader and advocate for its success.
B009178OQA|4.0|Real account of Japanese  view of tradition.  Movie a little slow at start but redeems itself about 15 20 minutes into the film.  If you love sushi you wild enjoy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of those books that makes you feel as if you are right there in that world with the characters.  Unforgiving, gritty and fully realized in both setting and characters.  Loved this series and have just downloaded the Shift Omnibus to continue the journey.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, loved the way things came together in the end. I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone, but wow!
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Brilliant book. Couldn't put it down. Loved all the Harry Hole books. I would really recommend it. A really good read.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|One of my favorite movies and the best of the series. So glad to have this with the Ultraviolet Digital Copy. Arrived in great condition quickly.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read this book as a part of my book club, and I really didn't enjoy it. Neither of the protagonists are sympathetic characters. I like to like at least one of the main characters of the book. Also, I just didn't think Flynn did a great job of weaving together a great story. It was simply okay, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was very enjoyable. loved the graphics and storyline.  I can't wait to see what happens in part two.
B00957T6X6|5.0|No other words will make it justice...just wonderful.  When is the next installement coming in?  Martin should just forget about editing anthologies and give us fans of this series what we are urgently needing: the next book to see when are the Starks coming back !!!
B00005TT77|5.0|New life has been breathed into these Beatle tunes and its all so well done. The original arrangements have been respected yet there is that extra something each performer has given the song. An eclectic group of singers/musicians have found common ground through the music of the Beatles and recreated it beautifully.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was another great season, but, somehow, I don't see this ending well....ya think!? The story is still gripping, I'm beginning to tire of the &#34;walkers.&#34; I will be back again next season, but I need some hope or something!
1439190275|5.0|I got this book last month after talking with my doctor about having problems with loosing weight. I started reading the book last month and began the Atkins Diet on the 4th of this month. I am still doing the Induction Phase, going into my fourth week. I have went from 265 pound to 241 pounds. I want to get back down to 185 pounds when all is said and done.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This especially emotionally moving movie will provide a glimpse into another culture which has a much simpler way of life. Great for the entire family unless graphic war scenes are an issue. It's in black & white, so any blood doesn't seem so real. This true account of a WW I war hero takes you through some heartwrenching decisions to a beautiful ending. It's one of my favorites, maybe the best one!
B002RI9UBS|4.0|It is an amazing book after you get past halfway it is very good at using descriptive words and it leaves you wandering at the end of the book.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I bought the soft cover book of this story and I could not put it down. I loved the new reading as I read a lot of YA books and this one took hold of me and I could not put it down. I was leery at first and put it back on the shelf and then something told me to buy it. I am very glad I did! I recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app has the most amazing graphics I have ever seen! Although, it is pretty hard to get gems. I love the competitions SO OOo much!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love all of these books and could not put them down. A great Read. It is a story that keeps you interested in the book and the series of the book.I look forward to more by this author.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the book(s) because it leaves me anxious to learn about the secret life of Christian's childhood, and all that transpired, leaving him so scarred and insecure about himself as a person.<br /><br />P.S. The steamy sex is good too. ;-)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great Game!!!!! I love passing my time playing this game but it turns out I waste a day playing. Overall its a fun great game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a cool game. I can't stay away from it. Every day I go on my kindle, I find temple run and play it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|The app works well. It doesn't seem to have bugs. It looks great on my Kindle Fire. And it's free... Yay.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. I mean I liked the original but Nw I cant evn play the original because I don't have time because I play this 24 7.
1439192812|5.0|It's fantastic (and a quick read most the time). It's written for young people, but I still thought it was great. A simple breakdown of some really fun topics.
0446580848|5.0|Reading &#34;the voice&#34; of John Corey again is like seeing an old friend who has a great sense of humour and an even more outrageous sense of adventure.  The war on terror, double crosses and John Corey's street smarts are all on ample and enjoyable display.  Take this book for what it is - an exciting, page-turner - and you will be amply rewarded as a reader.
B00881VLCE|1.0|not impressed, the games does not work at all.<br />i was very dissapointed. every time i tried to open it would force close.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is a cute movie about a bunch of cute college girls. And it's super hilarious. I laughed out loud through the whole thing. Highly recommended.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I really like this app because I can putm in the location I am going to and it will pull up the weather conditions.  I can put in other states too as well as counties.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|Got here in a timely fashion and works fine. This is my favorited season of Dr Who so far though I wish they'd release eps from the Jon Pertwee years on Blu-ray.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved it.<br />Simple and fun yet had personal feel that made you put your own life into perspective.
B001A4LYN2|4.0|Confusing and sort of disjointed at times but the power lent to the film by the cinematography and score were enough to make me overlook problems with the storyline. I think the film was very effective in spite of it's shortcomings.<br />Life does not come in a neat little package that's resolved in the end, and neither does this movie.
B001XCWPAM|3.0|I liked Matt Damon better... I think it should have been placed somewhere else. It,s okay but I still like Matt Damon
B0054SMID0|5.0|Kept us intrigued to the end.  The movie showed how the courts and legal system works with many deals and maneuvers.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Never a dull moment--Was very sad to see Judi Dench  have to die.  The fire works were fantastic.  How many more 007 can there be?
B00003CXCQ|2.0|I found the sound very low and I could not hear it even increasing the volume all the way to the top.<br /><br />The colors are kind of faded, not up to normal standards.<br /><br />What can be done about these items?
B002APU580|5.0|I love Jane Austen and she knows how to make a point.......I watch this movie over and.  over again ..
B00A2FSSHK|2.0|Watched it for about 45 minutes then I could take it anymore.  Could not relate to it, to far from reality.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I have read better books about the topic -- too much medical although I know it was included for authenticity.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very competitive with your friends. You can compare scores and try to be number one. It is very funk and time consuming when your bored.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|It is simply the best horror movie of 2012, anyone that is looking for some excitement should watch this. I watched it once at the movies and couldnt stop thinking about this pagan deity and the gruesome murders. To others who have a weak stomache and scared easily... You have been warned...
0525478817|5.0|The author has managed to write a love story on par with the notebook.  But this isn't your typical love story. This isn't a story full of romance.  This is a story of heartbreak, theirs and yours.  This is a story of two kids who live everyday to not what society would deem the fullest but what they decide is the fullest. It shouldn't be any other way. This book lives up to all the hype and I highly recommend it.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I saw this on Broadway and forgot so much of it. This one is the best I've  ever seen and the stars were all out and I could watch this over and over again!
B000URWYTS|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  I wasn't aware previously of the private life of Frank Lloyd Wright.  Great character development in the story. Couldn't put it down.
B0073PPKNM|4.0|I first discovered Melody's music on Pandora, and immediately ordered one of her earlier cds, My One and Only Thrill.  I loved that one, but feel this new cd is even better, with more variety in her style on each song.  I think my favorite on this one is &#34;Impossible Love.&#34;  Her voice immediately calms me...and I find it to be the perfect background music for making dinner, especially with a glass of wine within reach.  There's a surprising hidden track at the end of the listed tracks on the cd, so leave it on when you think it's finished.  Also, if you haven't read about this woman's life story, you may find it inspiring--she almost died after a bicycle accident, and recovered through music.  Now that I own two of her cds, I'm hooked, and will be buying Worrisome Heart next.  So why not five stars?  Simple--I want much more than 11 tracks!
B006LSZECO|2.0|The premise on which the storyline is based in this novel is very unbelievable. Being asked to suspend disbelief in reading this story is quite impossible. The only reason why I finished reading this is my curiousity  about how the story would end and that, of all the elements in the book, was hard to take. I have never read any of Flynn's books and this book has discouraged me from exploring any further with this writer's works. Any novel, no matter how good the writing may be, needs to work with a plausible plot and with believable characters. This novel was flawed in these two elements. I just did not enjoy reading this book.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read for a long time. It's not a book to scan but to fully read.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's lots of fun. It keeps me busy. I wish it gave more acorns throughout the game.<br />It is great for the kids to play. It has lots of animals to collect.
1449410243|5.0|This book is full of Oatmeal goodness. And now I've fully cottoned on to my cat's plan for my eventual demise as well. Fun and science!
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Very entertaining story, love movies about the undead some of the action scenes are a little too animated and over done. Great movie for both me and my husband!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|lots of fun. if you liked the original you'll love this game. tons of great things to do farming fishing hunting and more
B0091THDOM|4.0|This product is as its name says...... Snugg!<br />It literally covers the entire phone and holds it tightly in place. The only way it can come out is if you intentionally take it out.<br /><br />The quality of the craftsmanship is also impeccable. Absolutely no complaints & I'd recommend it to anyone looking for whole body protection for their phone.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|I bought this as a gift to my son and for myself. What can you say, if you are a fan of RATM than it is a must have in my opinion.
B000002IQ9|5.0|It brought back memories of a wonderful past and the transition to the present.  The music is some of the best out there!
B0021L8UPS|2.0|Passable because of decent acting by Isabelle Fuhrman. Just too long/ boring for what it is. See the Bad Seed 1957, which is similar but better.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I got hooked on Game of Thrones in Australia, before I ever read the series. The books really must be read to add the depth and backstory to this amazing series. Not suitable for children under the age of 16 in my mind. The violence and subject matter (as well as the nudity) is unsuitable. Can't wait for the next series!<br />Costumes and scenery are incredible and play a large part in making the series so convincing.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|I've seen several films on Woodstock and this is far and away the best one. It really captures the real thing and you almost feel like you were there.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Even if you saw it in the movie theatre, you'll want the DVD to see over again. There are so many little nuances that get missed the first time around. The cast is brilliant and the location lovely. After this one, get the pre-order for Quartet.<br />These films are wonderful for those who love the great ensemble casting that only the Brits do well.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was excited to start the first book in the series. But...Just didn't live up to all the hype. The Twilight series (though a totally different genre of books) was more engaging. Glad I didn't buy it and checked it out as an ebook from my local library.
B0092EE5HY|1.0|Didn't like it. Much like some of his earlier work. Now very well written. Prefer the Game  of Thrones series. Shows maturity as a writer.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|The game is fine but it gets old after a while.  Power ups are too infrequent so I had to patch the game because buying power ups is crazy.
B005LAIISA|5.0|OMG how much funnier can this series get? It may be the weakest of the series thus far, but it is still priceless, and heartwarming ass well. Getting more into life lessons makes it too serious at times, but still fun.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|It does have a lot of ambient sounds to relax you, but the app forces the phone into portrait mode. The sleep timer world well, but the alarm is worthless. There were several days it never went off, and the days it did it was so faint it couldn't be heard. Even though I got this as a free app,  I've uninstalled it.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I guess I was expecting something similar to twilight. I had never heard of the book before. It was very good.
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|this is the best horror movie of the year by a landslide they don't make good horror movies like this no more<br />yes for Sinister and Woman In Black<br />No for Silent night, Chernobyl Diaries, The Devil Inside,The House at the end of the street, and paranormal activity 4(although i like the other movies in the series)<br />Sinister and woman in black are the only good horror movies this year and the possession is decent
B007THA4FI|3.0|Slow moving, a bit disjointed.  Hard to get excited about the characters or the plot. Not at all what I expected from J.K. Rowling.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Not as good as casino royale but still entertaining. Visually it was a good movie Daniel Craig and Judi French were great. Other performances were lackluster
B005HSL626|5.0|three modes to play: arcade, classic and zen. my favorite is the classic. before getting it i thought it wwas stupid but it was a great game actually.  swipe and get the fruits avoiding the bombs.<br /><br />in arcade mode you are timed to see how many fruit you can swipe. for every bomb you get it's ten points deducted.<br /><br />classic mode you get three strikes and you're out. after every one hundred fruit they'll take away one strike if you have.<br /><br />and zen mode is never ending.<br /><br />great game!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Quick and easy review: I know, I know, the story makes no sense and it has plot holes you can fly a STARSHIP THROUGH!!<br />But this Sci Fi is still awesome and beautiful!
B004ZNA7WY|4.0|Dude  -- it is Pink Floyd!  'nuff said' It's a decent effort by one of the great English bands of all time.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Quick and easy review: great old school version of the classic Pac Man.<br />Game play is as good as you can get on a touch screen Android phone.<br />Very fun.
0679847367|5.0|My wife came up with the idea (or heard it somewhere) that you should get this book signed by each of his school teachers with a little personal note and then present it to him at his HS graduation; loved the idea, so off we go.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|Quick and easy review: I love dune and this is an excellent copy on Blu Ray.<br />not a lot of extras.
0439813786|3.0|The item was exactly as described but it was poorly packaged. In fact when the book arrived at my door 2 sides of the manilla envelope used to ship it were torn open and the book was exposed.
B007FC3AAI|4.0|Quick and easy review: not to bad of a movie, the quality is good for a DVD.<br />Do not pay more than $10 for this.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|This was a very boring movie. I skipped through a lot of it. I'm glad I just rented it & did not purchase it!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|*Simple<br />*Fast<br />*Prices are better than Sprint and the rest of them...<br />*The representatives don't try and push you into anything.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I enjoyed this very much.  It was funny and had a good story line.  This is my type of movie.
B003XDZLTG|5.0|My wife really likes these shoes because they are very comfortable and pretty cute.  She bought them in black and would like more in other dark colors or everyday wear.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Love, Love, Love Lord of the Rings. If you also Love it than this version is the only version you will ever watch again. Not to mention all the amazing bonus material, so worth the money!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautiful setting, great acting and an arresting plot!<br /><br />Aside from the entertaining value, the development of the characters reflect true human nature.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Bought it in January, 45 days later it broke. poor quality, high price, no worht it.<br />Please dont waste your money.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The game is like in the past when there was a great warrior like a viking and he tore apart dragons and wizards and witches. Talk about awesome!8
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I want to write this while it's fresh - while the nerve endings in my body are still alive, the tears just drying in my eyes and my heart so full it almost hurts. I just saw 'Life of Pi', my favorite film so far this year and in my Top 10 Films of all time. From the opening credits I knew it was going to be something special ... but I can't remember ever having seen a film that touched me this deeply on the subject of faith. Visually stunning, the film - on the surface a story about a shipwrecked young man trapped alone on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger - reaches out with such a powerful message of faith and courage and devotion, it left me shaken and weak and realizing just how meaningless much of what we humans worry about really is. Ang Lee deserves the Oscar, Suraj Sharma should have been nominated for playing Pi, and this is one I will be owning the nano-second it comes out on DVD. Just wish my brain didn't feel so scrambled, so I could write a more worthy review of this incredibly beautiful piece of art.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is fantastic. It is great to play while watching movies. Easy to learn an not to big a need t o pay attention.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is the best game ever when it opens. some time it lags and then. other time it wont. open
0307341577|4.0|The story is well-paced and builds up nicely to the ending. When I read thrillers and mystery novels I try to work out the ending, but in this case I was in for a good surprise. I liked it better than 'Gone Girl' and 'Sharp Objects.'<br /><br />The only drawback-- the events seem too unrealistic. But then again this is a work of fiction.
B005LAII80|4.0|This was a Great movie, with good 3d, but the acting was ok, I think it was better then the original. It's worth buying.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I have so much fun playing th different ones and there are many to choose from.  If i get stuck on one, i can go to another and then come back.  Great games
B005FMB8X6|5.0|King Crimson's `Discipline' was one of the ground-breaking albums of the 1980s. Robert Fripp for the first time brought in two fine young American musicians, Adrian Belew and Tony Levin, to join him and veteran KC drummer Bill Bruford in a reconstituted and for the first time guitar-dominated foursome.<br /><br />The result is by turns mellow and energetic; complex, interesting and fun, it sounds nothing like the work of KC's previous incarnations. If you like the music of Talking Heads from the same period, you'll likely warm to it immediately. Lead vocalist Adrian Belew (you can't always describe what he does here with his voice as technically `singing') actually sounds like David Byrne in several places. Multiple guitar interplay weaves over inventive rhythms to form joyful conversations. It's more or less instantly accessible, as good on first hearing as on the hundredth.<br /><br />On the 2011 remix, Steven Wilson and Robert Fripp again teach less skilled music producers the art of masterful remastering. The DVD is the star, featuring the album on MLP Lossless 5.1 surround & DTS 5.1 digital, and MLP Lossless & PCM stereo. The video content features performances of `Elephant Talk', `Frame by Frame' and `Indiscipline' from 2 different sessions for the BBC's Old Grey Whistle Test. Both the CD and the DVD feature extra tracks not on the original 1981 album release: `A selection of Adrian's vocal loops' and some new Steven Wilson mixes of `The Sheltering Sky' & `Thela Hun Ginjeet'.<br /><br />Even if you have an earlier release of this album, the sound mix on the 2011 package is so exemplary that it's worth buying as well. If you don't have this truly great album in your collection, this is the one to go for.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Unfortunately I have to rate what would be at least a four star game a two due to terrible customer support!<br />This is a high quality fun game.<br />However when something went wrong with the game and I lost valuable gems do to no fault of my own and even though the problem was a known issue, when I contacted customer support I was told by email that I had spent the gems in several steps that that I could not have possibly taken unknowingly or accidentally.<br />I was out my gems with no one to hold accountable and having already paid $10 into the game and putting hours of time into earning my gems this was completely unacceptable!<br />This is not the first time I have had this trouble with an online gaming company.<br />These online company's really seem to have a racket going as there is no recourse for a player who is ripped off due to a glitch in a game and there is no accountability<br />I have, against my better principles continued to play which is how I suppose they get away with it, but will not be paying to play!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Kate Morton writes at least 3 stories in one book you just can't put her down. This was the first book I read written by her and am on her third and final book and enjoying it as much as the first two I hope she is writing another one.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Stargate Atlantis is my favorite stargate versions to watch I love this show, I also like the stargate universe shows but Atlantis I think has better actors that draw you in and want you to watch all the seasons
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Some songs are modified from the original movie and a lot of songs are missing but overall it is a very good soundtrack.
0307476464|5.0|i checked this out at the library (ebook loan) and really felt pressed to finish within the loan period.  over 900 pages - that was the problem.  did i make it?  no.  but i wasn't far off.  HARD to put this one down.<br /><br />AMAZING translation.  hard to believe how easy this book read.<br /><br />GREAT story!!  i love the parallel world that the main characters slip into.  and providing the way back home!  i liked that even better.<br /><br />GOOD characters.  very descriptive and sensitive treatment of complicated characters.  WOW.<br /><br />a friend of mine suggested this book - i will listen to him closely for other suggestions.
B004QX07G4|2.0|Love Ellen, love the show!<br /><br />I was hoping to see a more serious side of Ellen and really learn about her life, struggles, successes and things she has learned along the way. If you're looking for that as well, this isn't the book for you.<br /><br />If you're looking for complete silliness and nonsense, buy immediately! Definitely lots of laughs, but hard to get through for me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i happened to catch this book on a day it was free so decided to purchase it.  I was going on a cruise and was loading my Kindle for my trip and wanted to get as many books as possible (I'm a quick read) and at a cheap price.  The reviews looked good so I figured why not.  I honestly didn't have high expectations as I had never heard of this book or author but was very surprised.  This was an excellent book and I highly recommend.  I would have paid for it knowing what I know now.  This isn't the type of book you can easily predict which made it almost impossible to put down.  If you're looking for a great book buy this book.  It's sad, happy, tragic, and at the same time a love story.  I'm hoping her other books are half as good as this one.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have read many Grisham books, and bought this one on the strength of his reputation, and on the current stars ratings, although I disagree and would lower the rating for sure.<br />The story line just seems too bizaar, awkward and untenable.  It feels as if the author had no real outine or plan, and made it all up as he went along.  Hardly any real character development either.<br /><br />Grisham says as much in Author's Note at the end, a note I wish I had read before I started it, as the Note seems totally true.  It says: &#34; Almost nothing in the previous 340 pages is  based on reality. Research, hardly a priority, was rarely called upon. Accuracy was not deemed crucial.  Long paragraphs  of fiction were used to avoidlooking up facts....Even the laziest of writers need some foundation for their creations, and I was occasionally at a loss.  As always, I relied on others.  Thanks to ...&#34;<br />Sorry folks, but I no longer read what I call &#34;Money Writers&#34;
0765325950|5.0|Long time comming but worth it.  Was the shadow defeated or shamed into submission: What did Rand gain, lose, and who lived and died may suprise all of you.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|i totally love this lil game.so cute and yet a great puzzle too. my son loves the easy puzzles and i love the harder ...only complaint is the ads.
B005VPSEK2|5.0|If you like Kelly Clarsckon,this is the colletion you need.<br /> love every single song<br />I definitely recommend this to my friends
0385341008|5.0|This is a charming, witty, quick read.  It's got everything a great book requires--quirky engaging characters, subtle smart humor and unexpected, yet natural twists.  I read it in less than a week with two small kids under foot.  When I was done I missed the characters like I would miss friends in my every day life.  This is a book I will come back to again and again.  I can't recommend it enough.
B001JIFYSA|1.0|While it did have a few (very few) endearing qualities, this movie was a huge disappointment. I'd even call it repugnant. I watched it because it was on two online lists of best romantic comedies and because Colin Firth is in it.<br /><br />Most of the characters were not even likable--like the step-dad who curses with his young step-son and cultivates in the boy a consumeristic attitude toward girls at the pre-pubescent age of eleven. Then there's the guy who confesses to his best friend's new wife that he's in love with her. A cheating husband (ever more inflammatory because he's cheating on the character played by the always charming Emma Thompson), a British Prime Minister with an eye for much younger, socially servile women and a sister enslaved to her brother's mental illness round out this bloated cast of fetid characters. The one decent male character is played by Colin Firth. His relationship is lovely and romantic, but it's such a small fraction of the whole story that the movie is a total loss anyway.<br /><br />One of the biggest stinking sores of this story was the couple who met and fell in love while performing together in a porn flick. Anybody who knows anything about the reality of porn knows that women porn performers are kept high and surrounded by &#34;handlers&#34; (a euphemism for specialized pimps) and that there is no freedom or dignity in the industry for women, or men for that matter. The breezy treatment of the porn industry in this film is not only despicable, it's fosters and promotes the deception that the porn industry is anything but evil and exploitive of women.<br /><br />There were ZERO strong women in this film. Every female character was stuck in vortex of the narcissism of an immature, self-centered man. I hated it and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. In fact, I'd give it a negative score if I could.
B000FC146C|4.0|Read this when it first came out, loved it.  This time it seemed to drag, much longer than remembered, but still found it enjoyable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish I can put more stars. I just don't know what to say it the best over the best. all I play is minecraft. but I do wish they came with free so I can plan my part. I love love love it get it like now. thanks.
B005974CNA|5.0|This is another example of fine writing and amazing musicianship. There is a new drummer giving the music a slightly different sound but it is still unmistakenly Dream Theater.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I play Draw Something with my mom and we love it but my mom payed 2 bombs for a word that would give me 7 coins but I only got 3. We both want out bombs, coins, and money back.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Easy to use. Simple but an effective set up. Don't turn it on in a dark  room while looking at or near it. Your retinas will explode right out of your little pea head. A + baby sun flash light
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a fun game if you went to play a game were you can control your on city here it is.
B008OOYALE|4.0|My kids and I have been playing this game for a while now and we love it.  We anticipate our new dragon hatchlings and visiting other dragon lands from our neighbors and the Dragon Story community.  I do not give this a 5-star review because I think the decorations or dragons you have to pay gold for are overpriced.  I think we could be more creative with breeding new dragons if we could afford to buy the gold to buy some of the expensive dragons,such as the Diamond dragon or Topaz dragon.  Since many of the dragons are bought with gold, we are not able to incorporate them into our \\"Dragon Story\\" land.
B0064W65SO|5.0|This is a dark book. A hard gritty look at crime and the people that fight it in all its forms. Frank Miller delivers a concrete blueprint of the early years of Bruce Wayne's fight against injustice.
B001KWTBVQ|4.0|Interesting probably pseudo-historical movie with some exaggerated acting; fairly accurate period costuming; e.g. doubt if da Vinci was in the French court, as portrayed in the film.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is one of my favoret games! along with leps 2 which is a good deal harder.  but both free and both totally worth it
B009AJD5E0|5.0|Great movie with great effects, Ridley Scott outdid himself blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Enjoyed every episode!  Started late watching Season 3, so needed to catch up in order to understand all the little references I had missed.  Each cast member plays their part superbly and I'm already looking forward to Season 4.  The costuming is wonderful and the setting couldn't be more authentic.
