B000002A3T|2.0|What can i say... this album is totally boring. Where to start... the most critical flaw is the absence of Roger Waters, the lyricist and overall genius of the band. Saying that this is \\"Pink Floyd\\"(I wouldn't even consider this band Pink Floyd at this point, Pink Floyd ended at The Wall) is like saying that The Beatles without John Lennon would still be The Beatles. This album's lyrics were mostly written by Gilmour's wife Polly Samson(because of course we all know that ol' Dave can't write lyrics worth a s***) and the lyrics are still pretty horrible. David sings in his monotonous voice like always, and even he sounds bored recording this thing. The guitar work is nothing but his signature random screeching. The music is barely decent, which is why I gave it 2 stars because Nick and Rick at least deserve that respect. This is as much of a David Gilmour solo album as The Final Cut a Roger Waters solo album(yet, at least Roger writes his own lyrics.) The only worse Pink Floyd album is... Surprise, surprise, surprise... A Momentary Lapse of Reason. Don't waste your money or time on this epic disappointment.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Will not load to my new Kindle Fire! Grandson in tears & I am out my $$$! Shame on amazon & Gamrloft. This app has issues. If you look at reviews you can clearly see it is faulty!
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|This is without a doubt Pink Floyd's second best album behind The Wall(Yes, I like them both better than Dark Side of the Moon, which's only flaw is overuse of Gilmour's boring voice). There's not really much more to say, you really have to hear it all the way through for yourself.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I love this app n any time I use it I knock out.... my only issue with n the reason I didn't bib it five stars is because if I go back out of the app it stops.... I would really love it if I could use the app while reading... if that gets fixed it will b a five star rating for sure.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|The music in this set is sublime.  It covers all of Duane's career from his earliest days to his untimely tragic death.  Combine this set with the essential Allman Brothers' albums ('Live at the Fillmore East' and 'East A Peach' at the very least) and you have an essential piece of you 'Desert Island' music.

This gets considerably worse in the 2nd half of the book, which really has such a different tone and style that I would almost think that it was finished up by someone other than the author - perhaps based on his notes. In fact, much of the 2nd half of the book reads like a caricature of the first part. Where weakness in writing, story and style just gets worse and worse. You will discover this for yourself if you read it.<br /><br />In grand need of an editor, if Shantaram had been cut to half its size...and you removed some of the...ahem...repetitive style of the author... - you might have the makings of an interesting work of art. With a really great editor, you might have an incredible work of art, in fact. \\"Might\\" is the operative word though. It has the potential, no doubt. But there is just too much wrong with the novel to really save it from what it presently is - a mess.<br /><br />The protagonist comes off as an increasingly mentally unstable show off, a self proclaimed sage, who in fact continues to break often reasonable laws, uses and abuse people throughout the novel - himself included, and contributes to the downfall of civilization pretty much everywhere he goes. Except he never quite notices this. In fact, we are led to believe that he's some kind of hero. He isn't. I mean - the protagonist isn't. The author very well may be. I don't know him and haven't bothered to check on how much of this silliness he claims is true. For his sake, I hope not too much.<br /><br />I mean, the man chases violence, problems, filth, thugs, douchebags, drugs, revolutions, psychopaths, and terrible trouble in general...all the while acting like some sort of victim...oh yes...the poor drug dealing, armed robbing, charity giving, revolutionary, anarchist, drugged out \\"borsolino\\" victim...oh but wait...he lived in a slum...what a bloody hero...my god...I am just left feeling so robbed of the mind power I had to use to finish this thing...just wondering whether the author could possibly pull out of the ending a little of the magic he had at the start...<br /><br />On the plus side, I was very amused at times and learned some interesting things about India - so I don't regret the read.

0307346617|5.0|Loved the journalistic style.  Loved the inside joke about the Five C's.  This is a well-written post mortem of what might actually happen after such a zombie apocalypse.  Truly could not put the book down.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I just downloaded this app to my android and I love it!!  Not only does it have the songs I purchased through Amazon MP3, but it also has the cd's I have purchased through Amazon.  I love this app and would highly recommend it to everyone!
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|8% of the males and .5% of females are red green color blind and along comes another game that like some many others ignores the issue. If they had just put some symbols on the pieces so that color is not the only way to tell them apart this would be a good game.<br /><br />It would be better if I could pick the colors as I could then pick ones I can tell apart. Baring that at least a different symbol on each square.<br /><br />I would give this game a better score of I could really play it with out just guessing.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so much fun!  You can swim through caverns and find special artifacts and the best part is the hunting!  You can evolve your shark to eat bigger prey, like manta rays, hammerhead sharks, puffer fish, & lion fish.  You can jump out of the water to grab sea gulls, jump onto boats and grab fisherman, or jump onto docks and beaches and grab the people!  I love playing this game every chance I get!
B008QTV3X0|1.0|Filthy language and pornographic sex detracted from what could have been well acted entertainment.  Acting top notch.  Too bad it was sullied by the filth.
0061124265|5.0|This is the third book I've read by this wonderful author and I absolutely loved it!  The ending was such a shock- I never saw it coming and I smile just thinking about it.  As all of Coelho's books do, this one makes you stop and think deeply.  This book made me think about :<br />1. The preciousness of life, 2. What exactly does \\"normal\\" mean?, and 3. Look for the blessings each day brings.  I highly rtecommend this book as well as The Pilgrimige\\" and \\"The Alchemist\\" by the same author.
1423140605|5.0|I love that they gave the discount for pre-ordering (as I did several months in advance) and they even gave me some money back because it was discounted more later on. Definitely going to try and pre-order more books on Amazon from now on! It's a great book, and getting the hard-back for under $20 was a great deal! Fantastic series, Rick Riordan never disappoints. Really excited for the House of Hades in October!
0805092919|5.0|My child likes it but not as much as brown bear brown bear so it is only read once an a while
B004QIG7CW|4.0|I really like this original movie by Disney Channel--it has a good message, good story and characters, and great music as well. Definitely one of the best newer Disney Channel movies!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It's plain and simple bingo. The voices that call the numbers is funny. Nothing too exciting about it. There's no goal to reach as many games have.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|It took me a few listens to get into it, but this album is amazing. The only downside is that it's not long enough.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was looking for something new to read and have not watched the HBO series.  A coworker suggested Game of Thrones . . . I'm hooked.  It's definitely my type of story (gore, suspense, fantasy, romance . . . ).  It took several chapters (and a printed character map) to figure out all of the characters, but once I did, it was worth it.  Ready for book#2.
B00004STUL|5.0|Great action movie and with Will Smith in it it's going to have some humor. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence make a good team. I'm not a fan of all of the music but for the most part it fits.
B007TK77QE|1.0|JK Rowling is not a good writer. With Harry Potter, it doesn't matter as the story she has created is so wonderful. This book's storyline is poor, which makes the overly descriptive and childish style of writing unbearable.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|What can I say......it's a flashlight......it gives light when it's dark and.allows you to have light in different colors. Even though you can only use the screen one....
B0097EWK3A|5.0|it was very entertaining and the searches were nice and challenging.  had to rely on hint quite a bit, but it definitely kept me engrossed.  couldn't put it down.  interested to see the next one!
B004UID2LC|2.0|It was great at first then One day when I tried to open it up, it said Amazon Unknown Error: Please Download this app again. Now I cant. Plz fix. Great app :/
B009R659L8|5.0|loved the book couldn't put it down. Mary Higgins CLARK ISan awesome writer have yet to find a book of hers I haven't enjoyed reading. if u have the chance to get the book please read it you will enjoy it
B00007G1ZM|4.0|I've seen this movie 3 or 4 times over my life on TV.  Renting the DVD so I could rewind scenes and fast-forward through the dull bits was a treat.  Everything is excellent about this movie, except that I don't like the characters.  I don't like these people.  The spoiled daughter, the weak husband, the mother who destroys her own business to give her bitchy daughter more gifts, the slimy socialite second husband: these characters are why the four star review: it's not fun for me to identify with any of these people.  I most enjoyed the police interrogation scenes.  The actual killer came as a surprise to me, but I should have known, since at the opening the murderer is not actually revealed.  Correction: actually, I did enjoy the supporting characters: the detectives, Eve Arden, the black maid with the squeaky voice; so while watching this movie, I was always a supporting character (to my own life).  @hg47
1451627297|5.0|It's a book that you want people you care about to read just to make sure you can continue to relate to them.
B00555X8OA|4.0|I found the book to be very interesting, but it did require a significant amount of slow thinking in order to grasp some of the concepts.
B00BQUUH7E|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. Fun arcade game. 2 player mode is great! Wish there were more game modes.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|... for 99&cent;, but for 7 bucks you can kiss mine arse.  And if I had a kid, and he got a hold of this game, I would be one angry man. I mean, the only thing keeping a kid from buying a $10 Amazon gift card and buying this game is a brief disclaimer telling said child not to. It's not even meant to be a deterrent; not really. It's an ass covering measure. But hey, like I said, I enjoy the game and I don't have any kids. Still... It leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|The game can be enjoyed by adults and kids alike. Gorgeous graphics and the music is very relaxing. Lots of fun.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Love this group if you do too you will like this album.  Very well priced so easy to download to computer. Songs are great.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The DVD came quickly and I really enjoyed watching it and sharing it with my family.  They loved the movie, too and we can't wait for part 2 to be available.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This DVD has a lot of special features that make for interesting background information.  We are looking forward to the &#34;rest of the story&#34; to come out.
B0078XGJQQ|1.0|Not an injoyable book at all. I found it the most boring book I have ever read. Give this one a miss
B00005JKZV|5.0|We upgraded our old VHS tape of this movie with this DVD.  With captions and special features it really amplified how great a movie this is.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Bought this after watching the trailer on youtube. Awesome locations, impeccable photography and above all astounding snowboarding... I would definitely recommend to buy it and see it on a big HD screen...
B00CHILW64|1.0|If you do end up watching this film, be sure to come back to Amazon and leave your review. At the time I rented it, there was a large volume of reviews averaging 4.5 stars. After watching it myself, I'm highly suspicious of the legitimacy of those high marks. Poor acting, poor script, poor story development, and several awkward run-on scenes that should have left a little length on the cutting room floor left much to be desired about this film. The story of survival in a tsunami is one with cinematic potential. This, however, was a disappointment.
B001QJUX24|4.0|Every scene in this movie dazzles the eyes with the magnifince of Monument Valley. Forget that it's suppose to be Texas. Wayne is brilliant and a standout in this ensemble of over the top acting. Ford 's strong point was not intimacy, but bold strokes and large themes. It is a film well worth watching and collecting despite its shortcomings.
B005XN0SGU|1.0|Quiet complicated to use, I had other expectations. I've been using comicat and decided to give perfect view a shoot and really disappointed me.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book fills you with mixed feelings you should read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This book is awesome and cool I highly recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you are at all visual this is a very addictive app. Turn on the music ... put in the earbuds....and browse...  You'll be hooked.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|great game though it is extremely hard to get even somewhat good suits. And the silver centurion (best suit) forget about it,only no way you r getting it without an in app purchase. But the game is very much worth playing.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another excellent novel from Vince Flynn! Fast paced and tough to put down, as usual. I look forward to the next one.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a really great app and so nice of the producers to provide it for free.<br />I really like it.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|Adam Grant does a phenomenal job of showing the research and evidence behind being a giver!  And, he clearly shows how to give without being a door mat.  Excellent read!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Mystery Manor, while repetitive at times - especially to start, is a fun game that could get very addictive. I guess it's a good thing you use energy quickly so that, at least for me, you have to take a break. Fun game - could be costly if you don't use self-control.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I like the game a lot, it's pretty mindless fun. If your looking for a fun simple game, this is it.
B002O2THRO|5.0|So much better than the present one.  You know where the narrator exists in the social structure by the way he handles that little skiff, and that Daisy is an irresistible dumb s*** from the minute she opens her mouth.  I've ordered the Gatsby with Betty Field and Alan Ladd from Amazon as well.  I'm curious to see that one.  However, I did think that di Caprio was a better Gatsby than Redford.
B004TI1WME|5.0|I had the free version which is a very good app. Now it is ad free it is even better.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I'm truly enjoying the ability to watch the series from beginning to end. It's always been one of my favorites!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Good graphic, runs fine on kindle fire. The game is a good way to kill time. If you don't keep up on coin collecting it can get frustrating as it takes a long time to get money for anything. I find though once you get high enough you can purchase buildings to collect all at once.
B009MYARIK|4.0|This was a typical Sophie Kinsella book in that it was high in laughs and very enjoyable. You have to suspend your belief when reading most of her books and this was no different but I still loved it. Highly recommend.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is great for my Kindle Fire, and I recently used it as a &#34;back-up&#34; for the alarm clock on my iPhone.  I had inadvertently turned the volume down on my iPhone, but the Alarm on my Kindle Fire saved the day.  You can load your own music (for alarms) plus it comes with several other alarms... and you don't have to have the app open for the alarm to work!  Great app!
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|This is a great album, there is not one thing wrong, I'm a lifelong DP fan & this rates as good or better than anything they have ever done. The music is tight, the vocals are good & Steve Morse is just an awesome guitar player. Buy it.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I read this book right after going through a job transition from corporate America to being a freelancer/consultant, and doing so was one of the best things I could have done at that point! The ideas discussed in this book have helped me create a mindset that continues to define my work several months later! Great book, and highly recommended!
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|As always Nicholas Sparks' book and movies are great for a boring weekend. I actually didn't like this book (which is unusual) as much as his other works. The movie was much better!  It is a chick flick for sure, but a good one!  They did a good of moving it along (the book was rather slow). Decent acting, not award winning, but pretty good.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Thank you for writing such an insightful book with such timely material. I'm grateful that it extends beyond the boardroom into every aspect of life. It's challenging and thought provoking and for me has reignited a fire that I thought had long since died out
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Action,comedy and good story. Enjoyed it very much. Large cast of well known people that did a great job. Thanks
6305212112|5.0|Oh my God it was good and funny.  The characters chosen for the parts fits each person so well and I loved the way they showed care for each other and they treated everyone the same without looking at the color of their skin, their wealth, their age, or their sex.  They welcomed all people into their lives.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, wish it had been longer tho. CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THEY RELEASE ANOTHER One or add levels to this  one
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game is awful I should just go out and by the PC version you should not waste your money on this crappy game
B003UBTX72|5.0|No, I haven't finished it yet. I'm 60% of the way through and it's as good as any fast paced novel I've ever read. I simply can not put it down.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Amazing. I had this set on DVD and was hesitant about trying it on bluray. Soooo worth it. As long as you have a good tv.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I lived the game it feels like it's better than temple run ,2 by which it is. Also my little sister can play and she can quickly adapt to the game. My mother hasn't tried out yet but soon she will and there will be more great reviews
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm head over heels in love with Downton Abbey.  Season 3 was somewhat more disturbing than Season 2, which was disturbing enough.  Losing Matthew was a blow.  But it hasn't stopped me from watching all three seasons so often I'm beginning to memorize the dialog.  Hugh Bonneville and Maggie Smith are amazing, Maggie in particular.  I am totally hooked and can't wait for season 4.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|She played it quite a bit for several days and enjoyed it.  Personally, I only looked at it briefly to make sure it was age appropriate.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|funny but difficult to handle missiles. get the experience to fly with the ironman suit. Sometime it lag but it is ok
034580404X|2.0|I quit reading this series about half way thru the second book.  The story line lost me which alot of the same stuff.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This is a very heart wrenching it beautiful story. Love at its core with an ending anyone in love would think perfect!
034544678X|5.0|This is a book that is easy to apply the principles, and gives descriptive techniques.  It really makes you think about what you are telling your dog.  Wonder why they seem confused with your commands? Well, read and find out. Something you probably never gave much thought to.  Now I am conscious of what commands I give my furbies.<br /><br />Enjoy and I purchased this book as a reference after I had checked it out from the library and had renewed it the maximum amount of times.  A  very very god deal for the value of the information inside.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched each season in one day.  So it only took 3 days to catch up<br />I cant wait until Jan when it returns, but it will only have 8 episodes<br />Hope the story continues as like it did with the Thorn Birds years ago.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Malcolm Bannister, former attorney in prison for racketeering fraud, knows who killed Judge Fawcett.  And, what's more, he knows why.<br /><br />Mal plans to use this information to get out of prison and exact his revenge.  The plot details are doled out by a tight-fisted Grisham, as he winds the story through Labyrinthian turns & twists.<br /><br />This is another of what we have come to expect from Grisham.  It may be one of his best.  You'll have to pay close attention...and the end is more of a shocker than any of his books except The Summons!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is the best bloons game ever! It is so fun and it definitely is worth your money. For those of you who think it is so easy that it isn't fun; well you are wrong. It is pretty easy, but still challenging enough to be fun! Featuring new upgrades and towers it is the best bloons game ever! In my opinion it is worth the money!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I really cannot believe how bad this movie was: slow, boring, pointless. I know what they were going for, and the transitions between era was well done, but the \\"meaning\\" really did not come through. Probably because I kept falling asleep!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It is a wonderful read for a book group- or get a friend to read it too- it raises many  issues  which gives the reader great pause and allows the  reader to examine his/her stand on certain issues  It also cause the reader to honestly consider both sides of an issue- a great read- would highly reccomend
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I have to say that I think this CD is possibly the BEST Rod Stewart CD EVER! I have been a RS fan since the early '70's,<br />but this material is without doubt some of the best stuff he's ever written... his voice is still soulful enough to make<br />your heart melt and the faster paced songs will make you want to get up and dance just like the old days... but lyrically,<br />this is definitely his BEST WORK!  I love all of Rod's work, but wasn't sure after all these years how much I would like<br />this new CD... well, I needn't have worried because Rod did not disappoint... it's a winner in every aspect.  The only<br />song I could have lived without is the one he didn't write... so I guess that said all I needed to know about whether or<br />not Rod could still write a good song... because these songs are not just good, they're GREAT!  A long time coming and<br />certainly, well worth the wait.  Thank you, Rod!  Yes, we do still think you're sexy and you've established yourself as<br />a world-class songwriter as well.  I hope all these fabulous reviews will put your mind at ease about whether or not you've<br />still got it... because you do!
B00BMQDM10|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has once again given us a treat. Wedding night is so sweet and funny and so, so, so easy to read.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I never read the comics so the story is new to me but I found it fast paced and exciting. I love the Iron Man series.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is moving. I definitely recommend this book. Beware: It might make you smile really big or cry your eyes out. :)
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Having only heard Bruno Mars on the radio, I had no idea what a great and varied talent he has. The collection of songs here is fun and racy and they all have a unique sound. I bought this CD on a whim and I am now a fan!!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book!  It had rave reviews and was on a topic that I am very interested in.  The unfortunate truth is that this book covered very little of the nuerosurgeons time in heaven.  It basically skimmed that portion of the story and went on to cover his battle to be believed.  Not at all what I expected.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|She is an amazing talent. Her videos are very impressive. She's on my list of acts to see live. Hope she comes to Phoenix soon.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I prefer this app over the actual website! Formats faster and more simple. A lot of great stuff! 5 out of 5!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book is along the exact lines of &#34;sleeping with the enemy&#34; starring Julia Roberts.  If you've seen that movie, you don't need to read this book.  I knew what what was going to happen right when I started it.  You will know even if you haven't seen that movie.  It's predictable.  Good writing, but predictable.  I actually flipped to the front to see when the book was released (wondering if it was before the movie came out) and it was 2010 (after the movie).  &#60;sigh&#62;  glad I got it from the library for free.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|The instant video did not work after I rented it and now it doesn't show on my playlist. Not impressed with instant video.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book wasn't fabulous but it was honest and for those who suffer from any sort of mental illnesses you can relate to this book in your own personal way...do I think this book will help those that don't understand, understand more...idk...
0761169253|5.0|While this book took me probably no more than an hour to read trough, it gave me some of the most practical and helpful insights into creative work and process I've had in a very long time. For me the most important principle shared is the fact that all of us imitate someone on our way to finding our own voice and speciality, so its better to be focused and intentional about it, than pretend like where not. Recommended!
B004EPYZU8|5.0|I love this movie and I love Emily Browning (so sexy) would be even more exciting in Blu-Ray but this is better than nothing.
B005HSL626|5.0|Very cool love this and no problems what so ever. Hack away to some great fun with your Kindle experience.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Good action,<br />good acting, good storyline, a good time indeed. leonardo is outstanding in his role as southern plantation owner. Samuel L. Jackson is awesome and the actor that played the German dentist bounty hunter is amazing.

0547884591|5.0|This tome will reside on my reference shelf until I die. The title is somewhat of a misnomer--the reader will learn how to become a chef within four hours, it's true, but she'll also learn how to butcher a chicken, how to use spices, and how to memorize a deck of cards in 43 seconds. Ferriss also covers such practical matters as how to survive in the wild, the Rule of Threes, and a fairly comprehensive study of Meta-Learning. He provides cheat sheets and shares the secret to learning a foreign language in a few short weeks.<br /><br />This book, if I'd written it, would have been titled The Four-Hour Life Hack. Read it and improve your life in some way. Learn everything!<br /><br />Oh, and I almost forgot to mention. It's gorgeous. Gazing at the hundreds of high-quality color photographs throughout, and enjoying the humor of Tim Ferriss, will life even the bluest of souls.
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|It's ok. Not bad for a free app, but I wouldn't buy it. Then again there aren't many apps I would buy.

B005LF9IO8|5.0|This movie was a refreshing take on the spy thriller genre! I highly recommend this movie. The only problem with it was Amazon's watch instantly service kept stalling in spite of fast cable Internet.

0375851569|5.0|My daughter wasn't interested in books at all until I pulled out the &#34;One Fish Two Fish&#34; book.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I liked the book because I like the Jack Reacher character. This book was very different from all the others. I prefer the other books<br />because the action is more non stop than this one.

193700788X|3.0|The first few novels in this series were refreshing. Sookie as a character was engaging and had a lot of nerve and spunk. She took part in quirky adventures with an array of vampires, demons, weres, shapeshifters, and so on. She had romantic liaisons with interesting partners, starting with Bill the Vampire and reaching an apogee with Eric. The peculiar features of each relationship, varying as the nature of her lover changed, were played well.<br /><br />But the series, to me, began to look tired as we saw \\"war\\" after \\"war,\\" with Sookie being an avenger--killing others--and being herself injured and damaged. A sense of deja vu began to set in for me.<br /><br />This final volume  has some strengths and weaknesses. We do get a visit from characters who have not perished but have played a role in her unfolding life. Some are bad guys--Steve Newlin for instance--and some are good. We see characters whom we have not see for awhile, like Barry. Making a surprise, and unpleasant, visit is Claude.<br /><br />I had rather thought that she would \\"get together\\" with Sam. There were points over several novels where one could infer that he might become another of her special partners. But I'm not so sure that it happened naturally and organically in this volume.<br /><br />In a sense, this volume closes out the series with something of a whimper. It was a fun ride--especially at the outset--but the concepts and characters seemed to get tired toward the end. Still, I'm glad that I persevered.<br /><br />I see something of a comparison with Richelle Mead's series, featuring the succubus Georgina Kinkaid. There were some ups and downs in that series, but it shut down with far fewer books in the series with some freshness still evident in the closing volume. While one could see the outlines of how that series ended, the resolution was more satisfying than with Sookie and Sam.<br /><br />So, it was a long ride--and at times a great ride--but the series is now done. While there were downs, and more as the series went on, I will appreciate the ups in Sookie's life as told in these volumes.downs, and more as the series went on, I will appreciate the ups in Sookie's life as told in these volumes.

B007BFSYMS|4.0|I have tinnitus--a constant ringing sound in my ears--and this app creates just the right noise level to block it out and let me sleep. I haven't encountered any of the problems cited in the negative reviews posted here, but I am docking the rating by one star to caution others that they might not have the same positive experience I have.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|this action packed game is realy exciting. would recommend to anyone that likes these types of games. great  game for on the road when xbox is not available.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A great blend of sci-fi and thriller, with a well-researched historical background. A few self-indulgent moments resurrecting characters from \\"It\\", but easily forgiven. I missed main charcters Jake and Sadie as soon as I turned the last page.
0307477479|5.0|This book in many ways reminded me of the movie Pulp Fiction. At first, I began reading these little chapters that each focused on a different person and couldn't find any connections. There wasn't a sequential order to the chapters or a linear direction that came together as a plot. But just like Pulp Fiction, it eventually comes together and tells a whole story.<br /><br />There are some common themes in each of these little vignettes, coming from different times, people, and perspectives. The music scene is always present in some way, either in artistry, production or as a setting of a time period in this book. A common thread in all of the stories is about a music producer that makes it big in the punk rock world, first as a young teenager that is in a band (cliche I know), then as someone that learns the business and becomes a success in his own company. Of course, in a youth oriented business it doesn't last forever and things change for Benny as he becomes one of those \\"grown ups\\".<br /><br />And so the underlying message beyond the music theme is all about youth. The dreams, hopes and aspirations and how those become compromised by sheer experience, fatigue, relationships and responsibilities that come by becoming one of those said \\"grown ups\\". Through this book, another cycle of youth becomes the new generation that will create a new world with new expectations and forms of rebellion.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, each chapter brought a new insight with another piece in the puzzle that eventually formed a masterpiece, spanning at least a forty year mark (it's difficult to really pinpoint but I think it starts in the 1980's and goes through to about 2021). Eventually all of these little stories intersect and come together to make a pretty powerful statement and gave me pause to reflect.<br /><br />I highly recommend this one.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|this might be the worst movie i have ever seen. it makes no sense. it may have alot of good actors in it, but they all must have seriously misjudged this film. terrible, do not waste your money.

B004W2UBYW|3.0|This is a L O N G book about a one of a kind man. The personality, back stories, and diagnosis possibilities are great, but there is so much tech language that it bored me. He is obviously a genius and much is to be admired there.... but I am not a techie...

B0001I551K|5.0|1977 animation film Battle Spaceship Yamato(Star Cruisers) is the short-edited version of 1974 TV series(26 episodes) of the same title which was made into English-dub animation series Star Blazers in 1979. US release edited out WW2 account of Battleship Yamato but otherwise the storyline is almost the same as Japanese theatrical version. As Star Blazer series turned out some of the character names have been anglicized and human-type robot Analyzer was introduced as IQ-9.<br /><br />During mid 70s pollutions, natural disasters, the fear of the nuke wars was so intense around the world, the films with apocalyptic themes such as \\"Japan Sinks\\" or \\"Prophesy of Nostradamus\\" became huge success in Japan. The film starts with lifeless dried-up surface of the earth in AD 2199 as the result of alien attacks by Gamillons from their Pluto outpost. Human beings survived underground but it has only one year before the radiation wipes out all human existence. It is the message from Iscandar 148,000-light-year away from Earth which is the last hope. Given the Wave Motion Engine plans attached in the message from Iscandar. Former WW2 flagship Yamato was reformed into Space Cruiser and with a number of extraterrestrial techs built into the ship Yamato(Argo) set out to the intergallactic journey.<br /><br />The film's success paved the way for sci-fi animation series such as Gundam series or Neon Genesis Evangelion and Miyazaki fantazy films.<br /><br />While it is similar to Star Wars, Yamato is not entirely militaristic as you see in conversation between Jason(Derek) and Yuki(Nova) when they saw the ruins of what used to be the Gamillas civilization. Leiji Matsumoto who took part in character designs and key role in production hate being interpreted as glorifying wars. The series was ahead of time and used mostly existing heavenly bodies and used latest astronomical discoveries(it was planned before Pioneer and Voyager uncovered the truth about Jupiter and Saturns.) The series alsomaterialized what lie beyond Pluto in solar system(helioscope). Despite its gloomy tones I enjoyed both the TV series and the film version because it expands our mind beyond Solar System and future space exploration light years away when mankind could only dispatch unmanned space plobes out to Jupiter and Saturns.<br /><br />Verdict: Outstanding sci-fi drama ahead of time. Good for Yamato(Star Blazers) starters.<br />Rating: 95 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Yamato(Star Blazer) fans' must-have. Fans of sci-fi films such as Star Wars, Star Trek, and Galactica series.

B001ANYDAO|4.0|His previous book, Blink, discussed at great length how people make snap assessments, and there is considerable research on decision making that reveals that humans see patterns - even where they don't exist. In this book, he tries to show how much of an individual's success is actually chance. Chance that leads to an opportunity to invest the time to become expert, at the right place and moment. He makes a strong case, but the &#34;magic formula&#34; seems a bit vague. In any case, a fascinating read. Better than &#34;Tipping Point&#34; in my opinion. I'm glad I read it, and recommend it, particularly to parents and students. There are some real nuggets of wisdom in here.
B009AMANBA|3.0|I ordered this book for my husband for Christmas. He passed away before I had the chance to give it to him. He was the history buff, Not me.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this years ago when it first came out, even the re-read was enjoyable.  I would like to comment on the Kindle samples for this book.  The sample is 90% prologue by the author, and only a few pages of the actual book.  The 2nd book seems to follow the same pattern.  From here on out, I'm going to skip the Sample on Card's books, it's just a waste of time.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|This is an incredibly interesting book.  It makes today's rough style of politics look like child's play.  However, it is very long.  Sometimes I feel like I'm reading the same thing over and over again.  If a Cliff Notes version came out, I would prefer that.

B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Has Tom Cruise fallen on hard times? A strange choice of actors with a very weak actress in Rosamund Pike as possible romantic interest and Robert Duval, an important, serious actor in a minor role. There's even Werner Herzog thrown in as the villain. The plot is an intriguing one, probably because it came from the novel. The script lines are weak and juvenile. What has happened to this once hot property?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show! Loved the setting and it was well written. Couldn't stop watching.<br />I am looking forward to the next season!
B00005QC4O|5.0|The producer puts you right in the middle of the band!  At first it seemed a bit strange as often the primary melody comes through the rear speakers!  But the DVD interview with the producer explains the reason he did this and it really makes sense.  A totally different experience!  If you like the Grateful Dead, then this is a must for your Surround Sound System.

B008XKSW7M|4.0|Another movie that pokes fun at pregnancy and parenthood. This one attempts to make the movie about the fathers more than the mothers and I think that is what first draws your interest. The role of the mothers becomes apparent as well. A little laughter isn't a bad thing and I did laugh out loud a time or two but it wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|This is a really great series.  I ran across this while flying to Asia and accidentally saw an episode in Season 2 first.  I was immediately hooked and purchased season 1 and 2 when I got home.  Our whole family watches this series together.  Our teenage boys love it as well.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|had to uninstall after update crashed the app. very disappointing because  i genuinely  enjoyed the game. I had to create another account as well because I kept getting kicked out with my old one. such a fun game but so many issues that it is not worth downloading.
B009ZABU7S|1.0|This app seemed perfect until I downloaded it to serve as practice for my parents. I wasn't expecting too much for a free app but I was disappointed in this one. Upon opening the app there were tons of categories to pick from; unfortunately, only three were available and it had to do with drinks and beverages. Regardless, I gave it a try and the voice that teaches you pronunciation has a British accent and expects you to say the word in the same way. I couldn't get passed the first word so I doubted it would work for my parents who already attempted but were unsuccessful. I deleted the app and am searching for a different one possibly with an American or no accent voice and with categories other than beverages and I'm referring to wines.

B004M9ZI0M|4.0|\\"The Tempest.\\" A film by Julie Taymor, starring Helen Mirren, 2011<br /> First, let me say that I find Prospero regendered into Prospera a marvelous idea, and can think of no one better to play it than Helen Mirren. For about twenty minutes, I was ready to welcome this production into the list of my all-time favorite Shakespeare movies.<br /> Why, then, do I give it only four stars?<br /> I found everyone in the cast excellent and the special effects stunning -- many of them at least as beautiful as the ones in the 1935 Midsummer Night's Dream. Another confession: \\"The Tempest\\" is so far from being among my favorite Shakespeare plays that I actually know the Dryden & Davenant version better, so the fact that this new movie follows Shakespeare's original less than idolatrously does not, in itself, bother me a bit. I never heard a clump of words that sounded unBardlike, so the adaptation worked very smoothly -- except, perhaps, when it interpolated \\"Oh, Mistress Mine\\" (from Twelfth Night) for Ferdinand to sing to Miranda, who could not by any stretch of the imagination be said to look as old as \\"two and twenty.\\"<br /> With each and every aspect -- performances, cinematography, script, and special effects -- excellent in and of itself, why didn't the total effect satisfy me?<br /> Perhaps what was missing was any kind of light touch. While respecting the argument that Taymor's is a legitimate vision of Shakespeare's play, I found it a rather grim and heavy-handed vision, dark in mood as well as lighting effects, and faintly lugubrious even in what scenes and characters might have served as comic relief. There were times when I wondered whether I was watching Shakespeare's magical masque, or Harry Potter's deathly last struggle with Voldemort. It left me, not with the rich feeling of thoughtful and poetic beauty -- whether of merry comedy, cathartic tragedy, or fairy-tale romance -- that I usually bring away from seeing Shakespeare performed, but with a sense of vague discontent and unfilled emptiness. At least, it did so on first viewing; and whether I will ever gather courage for a second viewing, remains to be seen.<br /> Perhaps I should also mention, just in case there is anything to the theory that sensitivity to impending events can affect our moods, that within twenty-four hours after viewing this DVD, I was among the evacuees fleeing my area's worst forest fire in more than thirty years. (Fortunately for me, they got it contained several miles north of my home.)<br /> In any case, there is far too much good stuff in this movie not to recommend it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Its a very nice game.  I like the music and the graphics.  The rooms look really nice , so realistic.  Whomever created the game dis a great job.  Keep up the good work and make some more games like this one
B003CFBQBW|5.0|Can you say---Love It!!! I just purchased the Eclipsed Soundtrack among others, and I have truly enjoyed the music from the various artists, it brings back the memories of the movie. I truly have enjoyed ALL of the Twilight Saga Music Soundtracks, and in fact, I am going back to purchase the music scores as well. So for my money and yours, you cannot go wrong with this CD nor any other of the Twilight Saga Soundtrack CD's!!!
B00CATSONE|5.0|A concise history of the man who nearly propelled the human race 100 years beyond the technology of his time.  This book gives great detail about how a genius was stripped of his vision by the demons of greed and jealousy embodied in forms of JP Morgan,  Thomas Edison,  and Marconi.  Had Tesla 's vision been supported to its completion,  there is no doubt that contemporary human society would not only be at least a century ahead in terms of technology, but also would have gained an immense social evolutionary benefit.  A sad,  but true story of how genius can be gutted by power that refuses to be usurped.
B005O64VH8|4.0|Although not quite as good as their earlier works, this is nonetheless a pleasing musical experience. Because all of their music is so calming and soothing, I find it quite relaxing when reading with this cd playing in the background. As usual, this cd has gorgeous celtic flavored melodies and harmonies, plus the added bonus of guest vocalist Moya Brennan. One can't go wrong with such a fantastic melding of superb talent!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|So much fun and so fast a read.  Loved it.  I played Adventure,Tempest and Joust.  Not that was ever any good at them.
B0042KZJR8|4.0|Although I absolutely love, love, love Michael Buble's velvety smooth voice, I found some of his song selections on this cd a trifle disappointing. Not only are a few of the arrangements a bit odd, but his ever increasing need to sing with guest vocalists seems trite and totally superfluous. His gorgeous voice stands alone, he doesn't need &#34;help&#34; from other less talented singers. But, overall, this is a rather pleasing 2 cd set from a fantastic crooner.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It isn't a bad game, but it gets a little boring and repetitive.<br />Maybe I am missing something or maybe I am too old.

1250012570|5.0|@ Ms . Rainbow Rowell<br />I read( ok listened to attachments Yes  i love &lt;3 Lincoln). So I end up also listening to Eleanor and Park. People ask me why I read romances or read in general. I will tell them that I read because its a reflection of real life and that it invokes feelings from despair to hope to frustration to joy. But this book remind me of being in High school and feeling like a misfit.<br />They say in middle school and high school we develop into the people we grow up to be . But these two people if i ever met them in real life would be the coolest people i know.<br />Ms Rowell u made me feel those insecurities those odd ball moments that ghrrr make me feel like my girl Eleanor. I felt like eleanor. In a sea of hopelessness at home but able to survive some how.<br />Park is cool. That it . There is no way to complain about Park because his family and because compared to the hell Eleanor lives there is nothing to complain about.<br />My chief complain is that U owe me and millions of others the adult version of Park and Eleanor . I want to see Eleanor and Park either get married during the 90's or reunite in our times with a second chance . I want to see Mouse, ben and maisy too. I want to see that eleanor can forgive her parents or not forgive . I want to see Parks parents and grandparents and his brother too.<br />THANK U Rainbow Rowell ...u and many other authors are the reason I havent quit Reading. Thank U for ELEANOR AND PARK .&lt;3

B00BGRA3IU|5.0|Sound quality on vinyl is better than the many songs I have on my CD collection.  With the bonus CD included, this a must have for any collection. Highly recommended.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|In today's entertainment and news world, sensationalism and violence are not only glamorized, but glorified!  Parents and other childcare professionals must be on the lookout for deviant behavior and provide our precious little ones the love and guidance<br />needed to prevent these types of tragedies!
B00BMEF8UA|5.0|This is probably their best DVD because if the high sound quality. A must for the fans! Stu proves that he's a world class singer and the band is as tight as ever
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|An insight to the events preceding the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour and America becoming actively  involved in  world War 11. Lindbergh displays himself as a person obsessed with his own importance, Roosevelt as a politician not able to act decisively. As one that was born in 1940 it gives me an understanding of the events at that time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game, kept me on my toes.  You really need to pay attention and you'll be fine. Great way to spend a rainy day!

B00CH87HF4|4.0|Good game has aspects that remind me of Diablo2 but I don't care for the time it takes to upgrade remove gems and get health potion...but its all a ploy to get you to buy gems with real money. I guess being an old gamer is part of my lack of acceptance to freemium gaming.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|There was no doubt AT ALL that I was going to buy this movie. I am deeply in love with Lord of the Rings and everything Tolkien I can find. Having three Hobbit movies coming out is like reliving the trilogy coming out. ^_^ Could not have been happier when Amazon notified me that my wish list movie was on sale for $10! :D
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|no complaints here. has become one of my favorite games to play while wasting time AND its free doesn't get better than that. :)
B0018AK9RA|4.0|English metal gods Judas Priest sure picked a strange time to make their first ever concept album. Their sixteenth full-length release, 2008's \\"Nostradamus,\\" is a sprawling, epically epic conceptual record based on the writings of the sixteenth-century author of the same name. The story, in a nutshell, is that Nostradamus making predictions about the world's future and apocalyptic end, thus leading him to be exiled from his homeland (France). But then, after the writer's death, everybody slowly begins to realize that the man was painfully correct in most of his assumptions.<br /><br />\\"Nostradamus\\" (the album) is a twenty-three-song-long set that spreads across the length of two discs and seventy-two-and-a-half minutes, overall. As such, it is pretty much a no-brainer to say that the record is really hard to swallow. And it is nothing if not overlong, a problem that mainly stems from the unnecessary inclusion of several prog metal-ish interludes, although a couple of these short-little segue songs are decent (see: the calmly-crooned and acoustic-strummed \\"Awakening,\\" and the dreamy \\"Hope.\\") One could argue that it is also thoroughly bloated, painstaking, ridiculously complex, and lacking traditional musical accessibility.<br /><br />With that said, though, let it be known that the record might not be flawless, but it is in no way a bad release, either. For starters, it is ten times more innovative, challenging, and expansive than 2005's \\"Angel Of Retribution\\" (which was, in and by itself, a fine comeback album). And plus, it is filled with excellent musicianship. Indeed, there are no two ways about it: Every member of the band (from frontman Rob Halford's unique wail to its virtuosic six-string work to its rock-solid rhythm section) is in fine -- and, at times, even top-notch -- musical form, here.<br /><br />It would take almost an eternity (if nothing else, then several pages) to give a track-by-track accounting of the album, so I will only mention the most noteworthy inclusions. \\"Prophecy\\" begins with about twelve seconds of atmosphere in the intro before leading into a crunchy, chugging rhythm that is comprised of a hooky, galloping riff and crafty, driving drum patterns. And this is all complimented by Rob's soaring vocals. And then, following a soaring guitar harmony section (anchored by twangy, grumbling bass lines), the tune segues into an excellent trade-off solo section, where K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton each take turns ripping out a bunch of lengthy, winding, mazy, and complex solos. This, in turn, leads the track back to its main riff, only this time it is anchored by a chugging bass line and deftly bouncy drum fills. Later on, \\"Revelations\\" begins with a harmonized guitar fade-in part before locking into a muscular, propulsive groove laden with fiery guitar licks, steady bass lines, and galloping drums. The song is further highlighted by some occasional dips into atmospheric territory (with orchestral-sounding background vocals), thus helping to make the arrangements sound vibrantly full, colorful, and richly-textured. Some nice synth flourishes and even a flamenco guitar eventually enter the picture, too. And just before things get a little too slow and plodding (for my taste), the song adopts another epic solo section where the above-named axemen trade-off solo after excellent solo. (The first two of which are blistering and wild, and the third one, which utilizes some tasteful sweep-picking, is gorgeously melodic.) This, then, segues into a catchy, piano-abetted sing-along bridge; and this number, a seven-minute long epic, wraps up with some great guitar harmonies and soulful, lung-stretching vocals peppering the outro.<br /><br />\\"War\\" (which stretches its playing time to a rather uncomfortable five-plus minutes), and the strings `n' keyboards `n' all \\"Sands Of Time\\" are both majestically-soaring power ballads with minor-key musicianship and spectacular singing. (Indeed, they are both mostly showcases for his truly amazing vocal range.) And \\"Sands\\" flows perfectly into \\"Pestilence And Plague,\\" although it is a much heavier and more propulsive rocker, and one that is fueled by fiery, chugging riffs, near speed metal-worthy tempos, rollicking grooves, and a humming, bubbling bass bottom. But \\"Pestilence,\\" although abnormally heavy, does retain plenty of melody, including some soulful, and near power metal-styled singing (and some of these lyrics that are sung in some foreign language), and excellent guitar harmonies. Another batch of totally ripping solos peppers the arrangements, as well, as do some interesting, slapped bass lines, and surprisingly forceful double bass slamming.<br /><br />Track numbers nine and ten, \\"Death\\" and \\"Piece,\\" follow similar structuring, as they both begin on a melodic note before jarringly slamming into heavy territory. A slow, brooding, and contemplatively plodding intro introduces the former song, but then WHAM(!), the listener is hit by a breakneck tempo change, rocketing the listener into a surprisingly aggressive onslaught of thrashy riffs, forceful drumming, pounding bass lines, and blistering, shred-happy soloing. And the latter song begins as a dreamy, acoustic-based ballad; but the song, which also features some catchy \\"woah\\" sing-along refrains, does also favor the band's heavier tendencies, as some surprisingly chunky, heavy, and even doom metal-tinged riffs cascade down upon the listener's eardrums. And it all wraps up with a nice, if kind of clich&eacute;, symphonic music-sounding outro.<br /><br />Other highlights of the first disc include \\"Conquest,\\" which is a much leaner and more straight-forward and hard-rocker, and \\"Lost Love,\\" a melodic power ballad with more stellar and crystalline-sounding solo work, warm crooning, ambient, reverberating keyboards, a cool string arrangement, and romantic (if, granted, cheesy on purpose) lyricism. And the disc concludes with \\"Persecution,\\" which opens with exactly one minute of creepy spoken-word whispers before kicking into high-gear and letting  rip a fiery, full-fledged speed metal attack with frenetic riffing and delicious twin-guitar harmonies that seemingly build off of each other until they reach heights that are comparative to the nearest skyscraper.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the handful of tracks that introduce the second disc simply do not stack up as well as any of the above tunes. It begins with \\"Solitude,\\" a pointless interlude bit, followed by the ridiculously overlong (and, to be frank, pretty darned boring, if you ask me) \\"Exiled.\\" And this is then succeeded by another bland and fairly vapid number in \\"Alone\\" (although the song does feature some more tasty, blazing-yet-simultaneously-melodic soloing near its end, thus helping to spice-up the arrangements a bit, if only briefly). And weaker still, \\"Shadows In The Flame\\" is another nice, but overall highly skippable interlude-type track.<br /><br />But it is with the next track that the Priest almost atone for every one of the stinkers that came before it, as it is a commandingly heavy track that finds Rob's vintage, stellar vocals soaring atop a pile of biting, chainsaw guitar riffage, muscular rhythms, and thrashy tempos. Rob also provides the number with a really catchy and memorable chorus, and \\"Visions\\" is also of note for uncorking a whipping and high-pitched shred solo, too. Following this, though, come two ballads in the form of \\"New Beginnings\\" and \\"Calm Before The Storm.\\" The former is strictly decent, and it does become quite a bit boring by its end; and the latter is a brooding and low-key  piece enriched by depressive, and almost heavenly beautiful vocals, and a funeral music-esque violin accompaniment.<br /><br />Some more of Mr. Halford's excellent (and world-renowned) proper singing introduces the album's title song, before barreling headlong into a lightning-fast, head-spinning blast of pure, hard-hitting thrash/speed metal. Some heavy, grumbling bass lines and booming double-kick drumming anchor the attack, but it is the guitar work that once again takes over for most of the song. There are no two ways about it: Downing and Tipton sure step right up into the spotlight, here, and proudly show-off some of their all-time best work, in the form of an abundance of fiery licks, shredding leads, and ripping solos. And \\"Nostradamus\\" then wraps up in fittingly epic fashion with \\"Future Of Mankind.\\" This closer begins by finding the band's electric guitars working well against a rich, symphonic/orchestral-music backdrop. But heaviness eventually kicks in and takes over, with meaty, rapid-fire riffs and chug and churn rhythms occasionally accented by tasty guitar harmonies and melodic solo work. As such, it pretty much goes without saying that the guitar work is phenomenal in this song, but the same cannot be said for the rest of the band, who do pretty much nothing throughout the whole thing.<br /><br />In conclusion, yes, it is almost impossible to stay engaged for the whole time one is listening to it, but \\"Nostradamus\\" certainly rocks quite hard (most of the time), and in the end, it leaves a generally favorable impression. As such, it is, for the most part, a success. It might be more accurate to give the album a 3.5 star rating, but this reviewer will round up to four stars just because, well, it is Judas friggin' Priest that we are talking about, here!ord whispers before kicking into high-gear and letting  rip a fiery, full-fledged speed metal attack with frenetic riffing and delicious twin-guitar harmonies that seemingly build off of each other until they reach heights that are comparative to the nearest skyscraper.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the handful of tracks that introduce the second disc simply do not stack up as well as any of the above tunes.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|Easily worthy of Tolkien and Jordan and a must for any reader of fantasy. A great story and superbly written
030758836X|4.0|What a well written and most interesting book!  I wish all books had such an interesting and unpredictable story!  It was especially fun reading from the mind of the main characters.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I'm very addicted to this game as is my daughter. I love these characters and time management games. It's really cute.
B008602KQI|4.0|Very engaging movie, but unless you have read the books, there are many scenes that seem disconnected.  Of course, it's impossible to include all of a book's content in a feature length production, so read the book first to truly relish the movie.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|It was a hard app to work compared to other angry bird apps my son lived this game but lost interest in it fast because it was differnt from the others
B004EPYZQC|4.0|\\"Fast Five\\" is an action movie that is bigger and louder than any of the Fast and the Furious franchise, with most of the principal characters returning, including Vin Diesel's Dominic \\"Dom\\" Toretto and Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner. Mostly set in Rio de Janeiro, the fifth installment is no longer about street racing, with action sequences including a daring train heist and a rooftop chase.<br /><br />In the film Dom and Brian, wrongly accused of killing DEA agents, are pursued by Dwayne Johnson's determined DSS agent Luke Hobbs. In the meanwhile, Dom and the gang plan to steal money from a corrupt businessman, Joaquim de Almeida's Hernan Reyes. The story doesn't make much sense, with a dialogue-heavy mid-section that attempts to give each character depth, which I found boring.<br /><br />In spite of the great action set-pieces and exotic locations, the film occasionally feels drawn-out. Action-wise, \\"Fast Five\\" delivers the goods, an enjoyable ride with a rousing (and some say, ridiculous) climax car chase scene, but more action and less speech would be welcome for the next time.
193700788X|1.0|Just to put it simply this book sucked!!! I fell in love with this series and was looking forward to reading the last book, now I wish I hadn't! It was like reading about totally different characters!! And I would have been okay with the ending if there had been some kind of build up to it. But it was like ok I guess I like you,now we will live happily ever after! It would have been more believable if she had ended up with Quinn or even Bill! Very disappointed!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|i think its kinda hard to figure out..it took my grandaughter a bit of time to figure it out..nice colore and pic...
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|The DVD release of this was my favorite 5.1 surround mix of a live performance - upgrading to the DTS-HD version was a no-brainer.  My only complaint is there seems to be a slight lip-sync offset in audio/video, but both are stunningly good.<br /><br />If you like live music, also consider Nirvana's MTV Unplugged album...now if they would just release that in DTS-HD (or TrueHD) as well...
B006M4F67A|4.0|there just relaxen games... I have a couple now...there a really all a<br />about the same..but fun...differant colors or pic is all

B000GBEWHA|5.0|Everyone needs to see this movie!!!  Songs are all classics in this film!!!  John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are a great pair and work well with each other!!! You'll want to see this again and again, just to get the words of the songs!!!!

0446581356|5.0|It is great and comes in even better condition. Helps for new or older makeup users. I would highly recommend.
B00B2G2RG6|1.0|I had high hopes for this series and was VERY disappointed.  There were so many graphic scenes that it took away from the story line.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. I had a hard time putting it down. Very suspenseful, and full of twist and turn. I totally recommend it.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|what a fantastic drama with just enough comedy thrown in to keep it from being too heavy.  The acting by so many was superb.
B006FLGBGA|3.0|Although I did like this movie, it was too expensive for me to watch it on my t.v. $14.99 was ridiculous.
B004J64QR4|5.0|Alfie Boe really shone as a wondrous tenor and humble man in this. Matt Lucas played so well and introduced his humor to the role. Lea Salonga was at her finest-after all, she's Lea Salonga and Ramin Karimloo introduced the power of his vocals and the range. Samantha Barks was shown to be a WONDERFUL stage actress. I don't know if anyone but Jenny Galloway could sing and act the role of Mme Thenardier and Norm Lewis could not be more stellar.<br /><br />I learned more about the plot from other sources, but if you're looking for the best singing in one ensemble cast, including the chorus, THIS IS IT. Victor Hugo would be proud of this musical adaptation! The Oirginal London Cast appearance at the end was icing on the cake!  A+++++++++
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez, a musician/song writer and artist unique in his field. His articulate and hard hitting and very much to the point. He can drive the message home and has a simplicity and a softness in his story telling. Great collection of songs and messages of a personal experience; yet able to be understood by many. We can all associate with some, many or all of Rodriguez's lyrics. Very much of his time but has travelled beyond his early years.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|In this game your mind really needs to concentrate so it is actually good for your mind I really like this game I am so glad that you guys or the company even made this game because it is awesome cool and fantastic wait I forgot one it is fun to me I will give you a five stars
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Just too good. It is one of those albums that a person can listen, enjoy and reflect. A very satisfying piece of work.
B009157BWU|2.0|Was really disappointed with this movie.  We'd missed it on the big screen............and are now glad that we did.  More &#34;hype&#34; than substance.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is good I don't think it's worth 4 dollars. There is no story and the maps are tiny I bought this with Amazon coins that I got for free not with real money
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I'm going to have to join the boycott. I want to add this movie to our library, but cannot support the unabashed greed of packaging the 3D version separately for full price.<br />We bought a 3D TV about 2 1/2 years ago, expecting content to become widely available. Sadly, it has not. To enjoy the effectes of the this great TV, we are forced to buy the content. We can live with that, since usually it only requires spending a bit more money and we can get the DVD, Blueray, Blueray 3D and digital copy for one price. Since we only watch the 3D versions occasionally, this is one title we'll be renting in 2D and missing in 3D altogether, unless Disney changes the availability. I'm as sad and mad about this as I can get about a movie release.
B001KZG99A|5.0|The purpose of movies is to escape this present for a place and a time when the good guys win and have fun doing it.
B007RFBLDG|5.0|Great cast, Molly Shannon is great in this.  Harland Williams, the guy from Kids in the Hall, Will Ferrell, plenty of laughs in this one.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this fast-paced and detailed novel.  So many survival stories gloss over the details of what it takes to stay alive.  On Mars, we would have to manage everything - heat, air, water & food.  The story was exciting and hard to put down, and very easy to put yourself into the main character's situation.  I laughed out loud at some of the funny parts.  A very enjoyable and worthwhile novel.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think the game is so good that they should make a third one.With more power-ups and upgrades.<br /><br />  - K.Bentley
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have spent hours playing this game.  The ads before you start aren't too bad, you just shut the ad down and play the game.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I think this game is cool because you can decide where things go and design the city.If I had made the game I would of allowed you to buy energy with game monney.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|We had rented this movie so many times that we finally decided we should just buy it! Good fun for everyone!
B00COHAUD4|5.0|This is a wonderfully frightening movie!!! I would watch it over and over!! Everyone in the room was SCREAMING!!! I was afraid to sleep in a dark room!!! The other horror movies could learn a LOT from this movie!!!
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I have really enjoyed listening to her she has a very strong but not overbearing voice.and is good looking too
0634022296|2.0|I would have given it five stars if it had a spiral binding. It's hard to hold the book open and play my guitar.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|i love angry birds!  so glad they keep coming up with new games or I would be having an angry birds jones!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Cruise always makes exciting films. This is no exception. If you have read the Reacher novels you may think he is not a good choice for the part, but her pulls it off very well.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The app glitches too much to enjoy it. Ever since I got the new canterlot upgrade it glitches too much.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is so easy to use and gets you to the right verse so quickly. I can highlight pages as well and verses which I love. I use every single day. This is great for anyone who likes to view verses online. Super app!
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Great movie on looking at how  things get done in a studio<br />Dont let little one watch or listen becouse it has some harsh<br />words But it is great.....I have recorded there
B009RH973I|5.0|I have bought a couple different cases and holders for my Kindle fire and by far this is my favorite.  It is sturdy enough that I have no fear putting it in my work bag and getting damaged.  Strong case and easy to put Kindle in and remove.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun for adults and kids alike! I could play for hours and hours. its exciting when you earn more coins.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Great book, loved everything about it! Made me laugh, cry, get angry, look at the stars....
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A really good fictional memoir collection. I really enjoyed it! The many story lines gave such a nice and vivid story and look into the characters
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Love his writing.  I'm just sorry I did not read it sooner.  It Works great on my iPad kindle ap.
B00BF11STU|3.0|While a very interesting story and topic, the movie was a little slow, a bit hard to understand the dialogue, and left with that blah feeling afterward.  could have used another 3 min of epilogue.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I like this game a lot. BEST I have found for Mahjong so far. I also WISH it had a<br />Pause. I have played a lot of mahjong and this is the first where you have to shuffle constantly. I also would like to be able to know which games I have<br />Already played.  All in all it is worth the money.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I have seen. I love zombie movies and romance movies. I never would have thought a zombie romance was possible. But it was done very well.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|There really isn't much to say about this product. OEM replacement ear tips bring your headset back to a useable state when the ones it came with fail.<br /><br />Well worth the buy rather then just throwing out the headset, quick and easy to install.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is just as good as shades of gray I have enjoyed reading this first book and ready for the second one to see  what happens
B002ZG980U|5.0|What I especially like about this movie is its concept and development - that ideas are planted in minds, which are structured on several levels of emotion, and their contexts.  And the interesting concept is wrapped in an action-packed drama, performed well by all the actors, including the star.
B002FVMLGI|4.0|I grew up listening to bands like Skid Row, and would do my air guitar solo on 18 and life. Good times.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Very fun game-- level kinda slow but very fun.. try it out!! Only lol 11 so far but good<br /> Game for sitting around
B003D87PPY|5.0|This is a wonderful account of what we know about the evolution and transmission of language - it crackles with ideas and anecdotes. I also recommend his subsequent book &#34;Through the Language Glass. Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages&#34;, where he deals a death blow to &#34;Whorfism&#34; - the notion that different languages lead their speakers to different perceptions of reality. &#34;...the most notorious of the con men, Benjamin Lee Whorf, who seduced a whole generation into believing, without a shred of evidence, that the Amrican Indian languages lead their speakers to an entirely different conception of reality than ours&#34;. Perhaps the only downside is that he can't resist repeating Mark Twain's famous &#34;Tale of the Fishwife and Its Sad Fate&#34; where he (Twain) pokes fun at German genders.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Hobbit<br />Great story. I love Hobbits.  If you love Hobbits, you should see this movies so as to be ready for the next one.
B007EW9ISM|1.0|It is not easy to draw with unless you can sketch with a giant crayon. The tip never needs replacing but that is its only redeeming feature.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I had the privilege to watch this movie with my grown son on Mother's Day.  It was a blast, we both laughed and laughed and just watching it was a bonding experience.  It was a spark to more conversation as well.<br /><br />This movie was both hilarious and had deeply moving components as well.  I loved the story line and both leading actors/actresses did an amazing job.<br /><br />I would HIGHLY recommend this feel good movie.

0812993845|3.0|Having enjoyed many of Sophie Kinsella's books I was excited to see the release of her newest book, \\"Wedding Night.\\"  Out of all of Miss Kinsella's books I've read I have to say my favorite was, \\"Twenties Girl.\\" The premise of the book immediately, grabbed my attention; who doesn't want to read about thirty year old woman impulsively marrying an old flame?  Another thing that Miss Kinsella does in this book is focus on two sisters (Lottie and Fliss [Felicity]) and dedicated chapters through their first person perspective. So, you are getting two views during the story. I thought this would be a cool twist while reading.<br />However, once I began getting into the story things seemed a bit off. First, The heroine of the story while, had the clumsy and outrageous nature of a typical Kinsella lead, she didn't quite have the charm that makes you really sympathizes with the character and most importantly makes you like the character. All the characters seemed a bit flat and the story itself just seemed to be missing the heart Miss Kinsella's stories usually show. It was a whirlwind story, but the characters did not seem to have a real connection with each other. I wouldn't say this is a must read at all, I'd read one of her other books instead, if you have never read her before of check out, \\"The Stand In\\" by Kate Clemens or  \\"A Total Waste of Makeup\\" by Kim Gruenenfelder.
B00095LIE8|5.0|Movie<br />The Aviator<br /><br />Review<br />By Richard Edward Noble<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors. I am at the point where if I see that he is in it, I will watch it. This man is a courageous actor - like Paul Newman or Bert Lancaster. He takes on the most challenging characters. No light, trivial, make-a-quick-buck parts for this guy. He has already had a big career but I think he has a future as one of the best ever.<br /><br />In this movie he plays the infamous Howard Hughes.<br /><br />Like most folks, I've always looked at Howard Hughes as a kook of some sort. DiCaprio presents us with a different view of the man.<br /><br />First he was a genius and a fearless entrepreneur.<br /><br />Second, he was a man with a brain disorder.<br /><br />I thought the man was just plain nuts but the movie makes it clear that he was sick.<br /><br />Hughes was a man of many talents. He even made an epic movie. I know nothing about that movie. But as a consequence he met all the beautiful stars and seems to have had affairs with most of them.<br /><br />Katherine Hepburn may have been the big love of his life - and his biggest disappointment.<br /><br />I never got the attraction of Katherine Hepburn. Whatever she had, it sure didn't show.<br /><br />Ava Gardner played an interesting part in the life of Howard Hughes. She was a strange one but somewhat revealed in this movie.<br /><br />She was, of course, quite attractive. The big thing about her was her fierce independence. She was not going to be \\"possessed\\" by any man. Like many in Hollywood she was sexually liberated, as they say. That means she was banging everybody and anybody she felt like. She was a rabid feminist before feminism became the rage.<br /><br />The scene where she comes to Howard's apartment and gets him ready to confront the Congressional investigation was something unique. She cleans him up and he devastates the politicians with his fearless honesty.  I loved her line, \\"Love what you've done to the place.\\"<br /><br />I guess the same could be said about Katherine Hepburn's independence and liberation.<br /><br />Hepburn appears to be the girl that broke Howard's heart - and maybe tossed him over the edge.<br /><br />I've read about Howard Hughes, the crackpot and kook but not so much about his genius and daring.<br /><br />Everything about this movie was impressive to me. The way the story was told. The respect that was shown to Mr. Hughes. The great acting.<br /><br />I gained so many new insights.<br /><br />Leonard DiCaprio gave a stunning portrait and gripping insights into this man, his greatness and his problems.<br /><br />I found this movie totally fascinating. I'm sure I will be watching it again and again.ed her line, \\"Love what you've done to the place.\\"<br /><br />I guess the same could be said about Katherine Hepburn's independence and liberation.<br /><br />Hepburn appears to be the girl that broke Howard's heart - and maybe tossed him over the edge.<br /><br />I've read about Howard Hughes, the crackpot and kook but not so much about his genius and daring.<br /><br />Everything about this movie was impressive to me.

B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Although this game was free, I chose it because it was fun and very challenging. You EARN DIFFERENT  things as you gain more points.  I really enjoy playing this game and beating my friends in this game too.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Is enjoyed it when you can get so caught up in a game and this one makes you want to keep playing till you figure it out.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Not much more to say really. Looks cool and does what it says on the tin and more. And completely free!
B009MYARIK|5.0|Have loved every book from Sophie Kinsella and wedding night did not disappoint! Lovable characters with many laugh out loud moments.

B0000AMRJD|1.0|the movie stopped working after 5min and i knew it was used but in the description it did not say it was no good
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book & couldn't get back to it.. it was exciting, romantic & also tragic.  A great read!!
0307352145|5.0|Well researched, while being based in thoughtful experience.  Susan Cain explores the complexity of the topic... I liked that it was very far from being a one-liner.  Thank you for deepening my understanding.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It holds everything I need plus more in one bag. The quality is better than I expected and when I saw a similar bag for 2x the money I was even happier.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Good story, good script, well directed, with cinematography, editing, sound and, especially, acting all superb. Some secondary characters a bit too stereotypical but both Alan Arkin and John Goodman wonderful performances for comic relief.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Took me a bit to get over reading about high schoolers but HOLY OMG this was a great book!!! I highly recommend this as a must read!!!! Great choice book club great choice!!!!!!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Slow start but turns into a magnificent feast of images backed by a good story. If you know this director, you know he can turn fables into gorgeous imagery.
B00006YXOX|3.0|Somewhere the originals were in Japan as the titles show up in a mix of Japanese and English on my car player; they also do not match up with the music in that the titles to the pieces are not the same as the jackets; the recordings themselves are great but if you ever get them out of sequence you are in trouble.
193700788X|2.0|I went into this knowing how it was going to end. I mean, didn't we all, really? We knew it wasn't going to turn out the way we wanted. I had resigned myself to that before the book even came out. What I didn't expect was the total...blah-ness of the whole book. After waiting all this time for the final book, I felt very let -down by the whole thing. I can't even pinpoint a reason. I have read some of Harris's other work outside of the Sookie series, and this book was nowhere near her best work. Despite the action and deaths in this book, I felt as if nothing actually happened. And she's putting out another book in the fall (I think) that actually wraps up the Sookie universe, so I don't even know what the point of this book was.<br /><br />Looking back at my previous ratings, book 10 was when the series started going downhill. Note to authors: when you run out of stories, please end the series before you alienate all your fans!<br /><br />If you've read the whole series, go borrow this one from the library. You may as well see what everyone is talking about. Just don't spend your money.
B000003CUJ|5.0|this is a great recording in my opinion; it replaces one I lost so am very happy to have it back in the collection
B0063GORYU|5.0|A fun game. I have enjoyed it.worth getting.easy to play but not easy to win. Easy to download and set up. So enjoy!

0802798225|5.0|This is my favorite book series ever! I ordered it originally from the library, but I loved it so much I had to buy it, but I couldn't find it  anywhere in stores but for the used condition it was in, it was a good price. I recommend this book for high school students, guarantied they will love it!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I thought this book was very well written. I liked the idea how the story was told from Susie's point of view.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Full of surprises.  Nice the 1st book, 1st chapter you are hooked.  Additive. Keeps the momentum all through the book.
030758836X|5.0|This book is a great read! Very suspenseful and a bit dark, a great combo. Superbly written, I will definitely be checking out some more Gillian Flynn novels.
B00CCFZO6Q|3.0|I've only listened to it a few times through, and it's still growing on me.  I just thought that there would be at least a couple songs that really jumped out at me like in all of their previous albums.  This album seems a little more mellow and subdued, which is good, but perhaps not what I expected...
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|this app was pretty fun, and I'm 19. its kinda  cool but some of the stuff takes a while to grow. its a lot like some facebook games
B00BLSJI80|5.0|So after Demi Lovato released her album \\"Unbroken\\" in 2011, many people were disappointed because it wasn't the huge comeback album she promised and she wrote/co-wrote little to no songs on it. However, I defended her because I wasn't really expecting her to be ready to write about all her emotions just after getting out of treatment.<br /><br />Fastforward to now. DEMI is released and it sounds like the kind of sound Demi's known for - strong, powerful ballads, as well as some upbeat songs.<br /><br />Heart Attack - I'm pretty sure everyone knows this one already. It's the other side to the story of \\"Give Your Heart A Break\\". A person doesn't want to fall in love with this other person b/c if they did they'd \\"have a heart attack\\".<br /><br />Made In The USA - Many people have compared this song to Miley Cyrus' \\"Party In The USA\\" but other than the USA theme, I don't see the similarity at all. It's definitely catchy, but nowhere near as catchy.<br /><br />Without the Love - My personal favorite on the album. Someone's sending Demi mixed signals and she wonders why they keep singing her love songs when it's clear they're not together.<br /><br />Neon Lights - Many Demi fans I know don't really like this song but personally I think it's one of my favorites. Compares Demi and her love interest to neon lights.<br /><br />Two Pieces - Kind of sounds like \\"A Thousand Years\\" by Christina Perri. Two lost children are trying to find friends and they find each other.<br /><br />Nightingale - Demi has said this song is about one of her best friends that she lost when she was about 13 and that he's always with her, she can feel when he's in the same room.<br /><br />In Case - Demi sings about keeping a bunch of stuff from one of her exes who I assume ran away from her without a reason and she knows she'll have to most likely get rid of it some day but she keeps it \\"just in case\\".<br /><br />Really Don't Care - The \\"All Night Long\\" of DEMI. An upbeat fun piece about not caring about an ex. Also a duet with Cher Lloyd (\\"Want U Back\\").<br /><br />Fire Starter - Demi warns us to watch out b/c she doesn't have any fear and is not holding back for anyone.<br /><br />Something That We're Not - Demi's trying to just \\"hook up\\" with someone but they keep trying to be more than friends with them.<br /><br />Never Been Hurt - The \\"Unbroken\\" (as in the song) of DEMI. If I had to pick a least favorite from the album, it'd probably be this one. It's not that it's terrible (I don't think any of the songs on this album are terrible) but I think it's just the fact that it's so similar to the title track from the previous album (and in my opinion that track was better).<br /><br />Shouldn't Come Back - And then we reach the \\"For The Love Of A Daughter\\" of the album. She may fool some people into thinking it's about a really bad relationship because of the \\"tired of getting so mad, baby\\" line but the \\"all the birthdays you missed, I was only a kid\\" and emotion in her voice lets you know it's actually about her father.<br /><br />Warrior - This song is about her abuse as a child (\\"There's a part of me I can't get back, a little girl grew up too fast\\") and how she's never gonna get hurt by them (as in the \\"you\\" of the song) again. She also got a tattoo that said \\"now I'm a warrior\\" based on this song.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this is definitely Demi's most personal and therefore best album to date. Would definitely recommend.bout an ex.

B00000612P|5.0|Okay, so he was on Howard Stern this week and that inspired me to buy this CD. What a fantastic album.<br /><br />We will just pretend his disco phase never happened.<br /><br />Or the 80's.<br /><br />Or his standards phase.<br /><br />Okay, so cross the last 35 years out.<br /><br />But this album is awesome.<br /><br />Also, cute story. My great uncle used to work as a matre d at The Breakers in Palm Beach, FL. He once kicked Rod out for being drunk and disorderly!<br /><br />Rock and roll!

B00CFOGCAG|1.0|hiya. amazon charged me for this download that i did not get. not sure if i can get my dollar back, i just wonder how many others are getting ripped off a dollar at a time??  i hope you are not one of them. i will update if they correct the problem
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very creative. I like the game for my son as wells as myself. It teaches cordination and eye perception, particularly when you have stimatism. I love the fact the game scene changes just when you have a scene down for memory.
B00004XPTR|5.0|listened to this all thru college and beyond,  brings back great memories of lazy carefree days. Taj always brings me joy.
B009NY43NY|3.0|This one didn't seem rushed like some of the others. I have read them all, & while the tv series has flourished, I'm not certain the books did.
B006M4F67A|1.0|The graphics on this game - light colored fine lined symbols on an off white background - are awful.  The eye strain caused was nasty.  Can't tell you if the rest of the game worked or not as that I had a headache starting in two minutes so I quit.
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|The production values are great. The casting ,wonderful . Mads Mikkelsen is cool and charismatic,if closed in the title role. And Hugh Dancy seems so intense and bruised as Will Graham,Hannibal's soon to be nemesis. But ,Oh-lala!  So violent and gruesome. 1 plus is that the victims aren't all women.  Some of the plot lines ,growing mushrooms on comatose diabetics?  Ugggh!  That puts American Horror Story's angry mutants to shame! But still, I can't quite bring myself not to watch. Poor ,damaged Will. Scary,chilly Hannibal.There must be more!
B0019IB0II|5.0|This book really does give insight into a world which affects so many of us, our friends and families and which the author is uniquely qualified to give insight.  Not only is it an engrossing account of what happened with her particular stroke, but it's an inspirational story of triumph over devastation which never loses its sense of humor, wonder and humility. I highly recommend it.
B00BNPZAEM|4.0|a bowie fan will be proud of this. a well polished album and a handful of strong tracks make the decade between albums seem a desert you were left to die in and The Next Day is the water by a kind man to remind you to live
B001U0HAYS|5.0|Full of excitement.  The plot builds well and moves without seams...never disappoints.  Robert Redford was perfect in this role as he comes to grips with the psychological games around him...

B007SGLZP8|3.0|It took a while to get into it...once  in it flowed well but I was disappointed by the convenience of the ending.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|This is a movie that from start to end keeps you on your toes.  You smile, you feel deep sadness, you feel hopelessness much like the family of the film feels and then the joy when, in the end you realize that there is someone constantly watching over you.

1844256383|5.0|This manual has quickly become my \\"go-to\\" book when the saxophonists in my home have difficulties.  I simply turn to the troubleshooting section and diagnosis begins!  This book has saved me lots of money on simple repairs like neck corks, and the preventative maintenance recommendations like lubrication and pad care keeps the instrument out of the shop.  I've always been a bit intimidated by all the clockwork mechanisms and all the interconnected, mysterious keyworks of the saxophone.  As a guy who likes to know how things work, but dreads breaking 'em, I love how this explains the hows and whys of tone production, regulation, key height, and more with full color pictures, diagrams, and exploded drawings - awesome!  (The Haynes manual for clarinet is now going into my shopping basket too.)  If you've got serious or budding saxophonists in your family like me, going through this book a few times will help keep that horn the precision instrument it was intended to be!<br /><br />Update: After a year with this book and a toolkit from musicmedic.com, I've saved considerable money on simple repairs for myself and the local community band my family plays with together.  The book has helped me replace about half a dozen neck corks; free up a stuck C# mechanism on an old King baritone sax; successfully troubleshoot and restore function of the mysterious G# assembly on a Vintage Martin Tenor; find, adjust, and replace numerous flat and needle springs; fix a bent octave mechanism on an antique Martin neck; re-lubricate an entire \\"dry\\" sax; find leaks; adjust timing; and even replace three pads on different horns.  If we had taken these instruments to the local repair shop, the instruments might have been out for two weeks each at $50 an hour.  I'll never pretend to call myself an instrument repairman; but in a pinch, I can help and save the local band a few bucks.  Thanks, Stephen!
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading book 1, I immediately started on book 2. This series of books rivals the fifty shades series. It was great and has a plot to go with it. I have to reread it once the third book comes out since it won't be until sometime in June. But it is worth it.
B003XDZLTG|5.0|I am living in crocs - I have been wearing classics since the day they came out ( and amazingly these first pairs are still alive) - I wear them at work, at home and pretty much everywhere as they are the only shoes that don't make my back ache! Classics are ugly though - no question about it! I ordered the shayna model a week ago and they are now my new \\" everyday\\" shoe. When I first wore them they felt tight but somehow still comfy - I have the most impossible wide feet with high arches and short toes- I was concerned about getting blisters on the side and top of the shoe where the strap is so I started out with socks - only 2 days later I opted for bare feet and no problems so far - I would still use my classics for all day walking ( think Disney or a long shift at the hospital - in these situations I simply don't care about ugly). I have worn my Shaynas one entire week- every day, long hours- on concrete and even for a short hike and find them very comfortable. One plea for crocs though - PLEASE make more Mary Jane styles with good ventilation. And as always - more colors and possibly a duet version :)

B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I used Kindle coins for Batman Rises and Iron Man 3 for my Kindle. Neither one would download to my Kindle.A waste of time and coins.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have to say it was a catcher. I could not stop and put this down once I started after the firsts few chapters. It was so catching that I read all three books in the series in a week. I later read the series again. I really loved this.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Before the movies read the books. These are a fantastic series of books and a must read for anyone who likes action and adventure.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I read Lean In very speedily on my Kindle. I am 80 years so the working part of my life was in a very different era.<br />But I have had the chance to observe  2 generations of children and grandchildren and I agree with many changes in the opportunities women have today.  I love seeing Dads caring for their children.  I  do wonder how many men can multi task the way women can.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I guarantee that you will appreciate the art work in this game. My favorite part is when they take places in the movie and put it in the game. This is worth the $0.99.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|I like the direction this is going...Bruce is aging and this appeals to his peer group, he's a dad that messed up. Kids are shaping up to be pretty much like their parents (except that his son looks NOTHING like him, come on, a family resemblence would have gone a long way). It really is sort of refreshing that Bruce will play the oddly capable geezer.<br />But there's not much plot or plausibility. Its ACTION, a failure of writing perhaps, or just a setup for ACTION is the agenda in the first place.<br />Bad guys were played very well, though the dancing bad guy part was highly questionable...was the the actor's personal statement? Did he really want to be on Broadway instead? Disjointed at best.<br />Either way, it leaves a lot to be desired...pooh. but I did like it a little better than the last one. The son is given a much better part than the daughter, now there's a mistake. Politically incorrect...the women watching this just might be the type that would like to see a strong female.
B00386EZJU|5.0|John Powell nailed the scores with this movie. Most times I forget I have the CD on and I find myself enveloped in the movie in my mind. This is the soundtrack that has scores I use for motivation and I still listen to it to this day.
B008DKBPTO|5.0|Glad it finally got restocked.  Lovely design and slim profile make it perfect for taking my Kindle everywhere with style.
B00BKBCF38|4.0|Ghost's debut, Opus Eponymous, was downright evil in its sound. This album is solid but not the diabolical monolith its predecessor was. There are a few standouts - Per Aspera Ad Inferi, Secular Haze, Year Zero, Monstrance Clock, and, if you can find the right edition, I'm A Marionette. As a whole, Infestissumam is a lot more subdued than Opus, and while it is big and glorious and pretty fun, what it lost was the core of malevolence we saw from Ghost before. Still, it's a fair sight better than most of what you'll hear this year.
B002BWP49C|3.0|A present for my sister. I hate the series but my sister wanted it. I want this to disappear as soon as possible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is very addictive!!! My daughter, husband, and I play this all day, she loves it! Very worth buying this!
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Oh God... I'm so sorry I doubted you Kings of Leon. This album is one of the most soulful ones I've heard in a while. Every single track is good and listening to the album start to finish I always cry. I love soppy 80s music like The Smiths and 90s grunge. THIS IS THE MUSIC OF THE EARLY 2000s that I hope my children listen to a couple decades down the road. So good.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great writing and plot. Had some nice twists and turns too. The movie is good also and the changes they made did not alter the book ending either. There was a lot more the movie could have shown. The book was riveting reading

B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I love all of Bocelli's music.  It puts a person in a real good place by simply listening to his voice.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept your interest throughout, as you became involved with the main characters and their struggles. Based on actual events in American history, you also learned a little about the history of our social services.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a good game,very entertaining and good for kids too. My child loves it. Played in the iPod and its a little more fast than in the Kindle fire
B004TSXUWY|3.0|I was scared that this kind of obsessive behavior exists at all. But I was more scared that the medical services in the uk could be so lax as to allow what happened to happen. I hope the portrayal of the NHS  (handing a patient to an unidentified person)  is simply authors license  and nothing more! Altogether a good read if one can handle bumpy road to discovery.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Books. Mystery. Peeks into the most modern technological developments along with unexpected history lessons... all connected by the human love for questioning, learning, exploring, sharing. The human spirit is so unfailingly predictable and, when viewed as such, reduces all notions of 'progress' to mere window dressing - interesting, entertaining, engaging, but just revamps of the previous iterations of humanity's creations... it is man/woman him/herself who holds all the locks and all the keys...<br />A lovely, satisfying beauty of a tale!!!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|The only negative thing I have  to say is now I am addicted!  I have enjoyed learning about the lifestyles of the  privileged and those who served them,the first World War and the level of medical treatment for injured soldiers.  A fascinating and well researched series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great, but now for some reason i can not retrieve on my kindle anymore .  I am so mad
0307352153|3.0|Cain's book, \\"Quiet - The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\\", is thought-provoking and unique. It is a project that is much needed and her premise is, I think, spot on. Changing your thinking about introversion and extroversion can affect how you run a business, interact with your friends, raise your children, and even develop as a person. Cain stresses this point, over and over and over again - to the point where you begin to feel a bit overwhelmed at the number of stories in the book. And this is, despite a great idea and a much needed discussion topic, where I think the book fails. It's a book of anecdotal stories, you realize, and not much else. The main thrust of the book lies in the psychology behind introversion; however, it quickly becomes clear that Cain isn't a psychologist, nor does she have much training in the subject.<br /><br />Cain, a lawyer and consultant, cherry picks her research, doesn't show the other side of the story, and presents theories and ideas as basic fact, regardless of whether they are accepted as such or not. The experiments are indeed interesting and make you think twice about personality, but there's no conclusive \\"evidence\\" to be found in this book. Her chapter on Asians (of which I am not) is downright laughable and extremely frustrating at the same time - it's clear she's never been to the region, studied the culture, or thought deep about the topic. Her evidence comes from a few studies and the anecdotal stories from the people she interviewed.<br /><br />This book was a good attempt at starting the discussion about our extroverted-driven society, but it was equally frustrating for its lack of clear evidence and basis on anecdotal interviews and evidence. I'd recommend it as a good library book, but maybe not a bookshelf one.

0375842209|5.0|This is a novel meant for children, but it is written so masterfully and beautifully that it becomes great literature for kids and adults alike. It is about the holocaust, a heavy topic for children, but handled tastefully so as not to be disturbing.
B001O9BB3G|5.0|Compelling and unconventional. An unpredictable love story leaving you wanting infinitely more. The way a good book should.<br />I am a new fan of Shamim Sarif. Cannot wait to dive into her latest book!

1451697686|5.0|I enjoyed this book on a variety of levels. While I am not new to the idea of reducing waste, this was the first time I've seen it written about in such an engaging, informative way. Lots of practical suggestions and resources that will be helpful to anyone regardless of whether simplifying is a new or familiar concept. I really appreciated her sense of humor and willingness to admit when things she had tried just didn't work for their family (such as making her own bread). When you read that kind of story, you realize that there isn't necessarily one \\"right\\" way to live a simpler, more environmentally friendly life. Just keep making small changes and do what you can without feeling guilty for all the things those \\"greener\\" than you are doing.
0393343405|5.0|Well written account of an interesting subject that touches on history, philosophy and art.  The philosophical discussions provide a useful counterpoint to the current atmosphere of religious extremism.
B009NY43NY|4.0|This book was a fast read and I think that although I (and other readers) may not have gotten the most fulfilling ending...it was an entertaining read. I didn't want to put it down.
193700788X|2.0|SPOILERS.....<br /><br />From the very first pages I felt something was off. The writing felt off; sloppy, strange, inconsistent with Harris' usually witty, hilarious prose. It just felt disjointed and it threw me off. I swear it felt like Harris just wanted to get this series over with and just didn't care enough anymore. What else are we to think when her most cherished characters are left on the back burner, practically non-existent.<br /><br />I'm pretty frustrated, to say the least. I know all books can't end the way I'D like for them to end, but to be THIS predictable is just annoying. I mean come on.... SAM?!! Sam... Really? How convenient that she ends up with a guy who's thoughts she can't really hear 99% of the time. Even though she put him off the entire series, told him time and time again what a great friend he was to her, how much it meant to has his friendship. And then a week after Eric leaves she's in his trailer practically begging for him. I can't even deal with that.<br /><br />Speaking of Mr. Northman.... Siiiiiigh, where to begin. Yes, I am completely biased towards him. I don't think I was delusional enough to think he and Sookie would end up living happily ever after as two beautiful vampires. BUT, I didn't expect him to literally run away like he did. I'm pretty sure Harris must loathe him for otherwise I can't figure out why she would discard him like an old pair of socks.<br /><br />He's only in the book for a few sentences and again, it was frustrating to keep on reading. I kept thinking, no, something is bound to happen, he will reappear and everything will be fine and dandy in the end. This is not the Eric we've come to know for the past however many years. Eric is proud, strong and determined. He cares for and protects what is his. But apparently Sookie just didn't matter enough for him. And vice versa. Sookie never even glanced back. For all her pining, and her aching heart and her tears, I guess it was just all too easy to sweep himunder her rug. And forget he ever existed.<br /><br />The end of the book felt hasty and weird. Yes I figured Claude would make an entrance at some point but it was just DUMB how it all came about. Many of the loose ends were neatly tied up, and by neat I mean convenient. Right down to Sookie's seemingly forgiving nature towards Bill, to Pam becoming the new sheriff after Eric leaves.  I can't really think of anything positive to say about this last book. This is not the Charlaine Harris I fell in love with.
B00957T6X6|5.0|In depth characters, plots and world oh my! Martin has created an untypical world for fantasy.....its mostly normal but with a few twists....were left to form educated guesses about the mechanics of the universe almost as if we were part of it....the characters exude character and the thought processes Martin  gives us are detailed and believable....no boys on quests for magic swords or the goal to defeat some ultimate evil guy Martin's plots are gritty, wild, evocative and intriguing. ....a must read for any serious scifi\fantasy type
B004DK5CW4|5.0|A wonderful movie about an amazing horse.  Those surrounding him show their love, trust, and dedication to his well-being and marvelous accomplishments.  A wonderful and heart warming movie.  I would recommend it to all horse lovers!
B000YDOOUK|5.0|Reminiscent of AC/DC, but what the Hey!, that's why I bought it.  Long Hair, loud, in your face C*ck Rock.  Nothin' better to get the blood pumping before an offroad Dirt Bike ride.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|A great book!  This well written fantasy has provided many hours of contented reading.  Way to exciting to put down!
B003JH8LPW|4.0|All Dan Brown books are great.  Great thriller, couldn't put it down. Looking forward to his next book coming soon.
B00C2C637I|4.0|I chose this rating because it was good but it strayed some. I would however recommend the book to those that like something kind of scary.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|I would like to forget this book ever happened. It was like really horrible fanfic. So disappointed. Don't waste your time.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I've been *hearing* Rod Stewart music most of my life, but this is the first I've purchased. (I bought it after hearing an amazing interview on Howard Stern.) If you've grown up listing to Rod Stewart and have enjoyed it, this is a great choice for a \\"grown up\\" you listening to a grown up Rod Stewart. I also think that the tempos would be great for listening while running--a couple fast, then a slower one--mostly upbeat and mostly infectious. The raspy voice is the same; a lot of the style is typical RS, so if you like that, you'll probably like this. If you never liked him, you won't like this either.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was much better than I expected it to be after all the hype and the young people seeing it over and over.
1432794426|5.0|After Reading about two meters of books on Michael Jackson after his Death, this book came on top of all the others. Then I did not expect so much New information. And that was right. The good thing about this book is that it can be read by everybody, all ages. It says a lot about the last years of MJ's life and not so much about the rest. But that is so well documented before so it is OK.<br />What I liked best With this book is the love that shines through it. This is something recognisable for us the fans. It is very Nice to read a book by a well educated person With so much love for the King of Pop. It is much more serious than most of the older books about MJ.<br />For those who are very much into MJ and know a lot about him, this book does not give you anything New, but for those who have just started to read about him, this is a very good book to read.<br />Recomended.
B002E01LL6|5.0|I love Dito Montiel, and have begun to really notice Channing Tatum. This is not quite \\"On the Waterfront\\" but it's a powerful and surprising \\"thinking\\" movie.<br />Channing Tatum as an actor suffers from the same handicap that many other handsome actors suffer from: it's so easy to be charmed by his looks that you can easily lose track of what a talented actor he is. But if he keeps pushing I think he can overcome this handicap, at least I really hope he will, because he is a gem of an actor.<br /><br />As for the movie: if you are looking for a traditional \\"fighting\\" movie, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a movie with an exciting plot, find something else.<br />It's a movie about being beaten down and standing up. And, not unrelated, it's about being able to create tenderness and beauty in the middle of garbage. The quiet exchanges between the main characters are powerful and painful and tender. The unlikely bonding between Tatum's and Howard's characters has depth and pain and beauty. A signature of Montiel's stories and directing, the tender scenes between Shawn MacArthur (\\"like a knight\\" what a gem of a line!!!) and the girl Zulay leave you breathless.<br />There's a running theme throughout the movie that is a reply to Brando's \\"I coulda been a contenda\\", and what a reply it is! I just about jumped out of my own skin when I got the reply.<br />As for Tatum's acting, his facial expressions and body language speak volumes. He's a wonderful actor.<br /><br />The only problem with this movie is that it hasn't been noticed by the audience it should reach. But it will.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great book. Very well written with appropriate amount of description for each character. Appears to be out of a real life high school. Must read for everyone.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I have loved this movie since I first saw it as a teen. Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire in competition for the girl makes for a hilarious movie! The music is wonderful, as is the dancing, and I loved the storyline. Lots of people think of this one as a Christmas movie (in a way, I suppose you could). However, all the holidays are included, hence the title &#34;Holiday Inn&#34;. So it is great to see the different production pieces for Easter, Fourth of July, President's Day, et cetera. Loved the sets, costumes, and dance. Fred Astaire has never been better for his humor and his dance. I love that man's feet! He is so suave, so debonair, so nasty! In the end, boy gets girl, but I won't tell you who won. Watch this one and laugh along!
B00B0ND67K|5.0|A refreshing take on country music. Their voices blend together much like Lady A. I hope they continue to make music together for years.
B002VWNID6|5.0|If you like Costner, you will love this film. A classic take on the Robin Hood myth and Costner delivers! This film has action (lots of it) yet doesn't overdo it with blood and gore. There is romance (of course) with Maid Marion being the object of desire for Robin and the Sheriff of Nottingham. But it is also quite humorous! There are a lot of good one-liners from Robin, Maid Marion and the Sheriff; I found myself often rolling on the floor with tears in my eyes from laughing so hard! The costuming is gorgeous and the sets are quite authentic. I loved the bow that Costner used and Marion's gowns were lovely. I have been a Kevin Costner fan for years (could you tell?) so of course, I like this movie. No, I LOVE this movie! The music is so great and features songs by Bryan Adams; the theme song was written by him just for this film and became a hit on the radio &#34;Everything I Do (I Do It For You). Get this movie now and watch it! I promise you that you will not regret purchasing this one.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I'm still learning... But so far, I've been getting my fix for puzzles. Looks like there are a lot of puzzles and like how they have them catagorized.
B00CIU3IVS|4.0|Reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet soundtrack, which is probably my all-time favorite. It's a little more &#34;pop-ie&#34;, not quite as edgy as R&J when it came out. But I haven't seen the Great Gatsby yet, so it is possible my opinion on that my change. Overall I like it. It's got a great mix of tunes, 20s jazz with a twist.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I agree with the Wheat Belly premise, grains in general being the main cause of obesity. Wheat happens to be the most prevalent. However, I gave this book 3 stars because it's redundant. Dr, Davis beats the horse, repeating himself from his podium, until one gets quite weary of the lecture.. The information most readers want to know could have been gleaned in 20 pages or less.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I love the way it made me stop and think about the story - the descriptions, the reactions, the dialogues, the teasing-out of the tale, the way books and reading and magic and being and responsibility and love were weaved in. It was gorgeous and unexpected, and at the last page I felt a strong sense of satisfaction with how it ended. No sequel needed; it still lives within my own memory; it builds and let the reader build upon the tale too.  Excellent and immensely pleasing. I did not want to rush through it - indeed, I could read and then dwell on the imagery and the puzzles of the characters for hours afterwards. This is a talespinner's delight!
B003UESJF6|5.0|This movie came quickly and was in very good condition. I can watch this movie over and over again and I'm an adult!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|My headline says it all. This movie was an epic chapter in the Batman saga. Certainly an excellent movie to watch.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|definately keeps you on your toes! raises some great questions too youll be left breathless it was very relatedable for parents
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It seems as though we tend to prefer a Creator who is bound by our own human limitations (if we choose to believe in one at all).  Alexander's amazing experience gives credence to the suspicion, hope, or belief that our present existence is but a fraction of what &#34;is&#34; and &#34;is to be.&#34;  Without couching his experience in religious terms, he has documented details that dovetail with many beliefs about God, heaven, and the presence of things unseen to us in the life we know.<br /><br />Whether one believes our brains were divinely created through ever-evolving adaptation to this world or by some other means, it should be obvious to the thoughtful person that our minds can only attempt to grasp concepts beyond elements known to us.  To me, this is where faith and hope enter the picture.  I'm a thinking Christian, but this book is one that may open new doorways of thought for readers of any loving belief--or non-belief!  Not especially for the closed- or small-minded.  --B. Beuning
B00A757EFW|3.0|It is still fun as the &#34;old days&#34; original, but the controller is difficult to manuver fast enough sometimes. It stalls instead of moving the direction it needs to go; before the ghosts get me.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|I thought the movie was funny and had a lot of action. It did have some sad and scarry moments wich were fine. But if a child actually believes in Santa, Easter Bunnt and Tooth fairy this is not the movie for them. My children are older and do not believe in them and did enjoy it.
B009R659L8|4.0|The book was far better than the reviews gave it credit for.  It did wrap up rather quickly in the end but not as bad as other books and all my questions were answered.  Overall I enjoyed the book.  Another quick, good read from a great author.
B001NTFQRY|4.0|Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou is a Greek composer of electronic, progressive, ambient, jazz, pop rock, and orchestral music under the artist name Vangelis. Composing and performing most of his music on a large setup of keyboards and synthesizers, Vangelis has released over 40 albums and created music for film, theater productions and one-off live concerts. His music, usually very melodic, often instrumental, sometimes relaxing, but always inspiring. A one man band? Perhaps. I don't know much about him beyond that I enjoy this type of music ever since I heard it on Carl Sagan's COSMOS. You think of Vangelis as a composer with historical echoes of Ravel and Debussy, save what he writes is 50 years ahead of any other ambient composer.  It holds the a heavenly, otherworldly tranquility to it. Therefore all the future sounds a listener expects, such as what was found in Heaven and Hell, Part I, Chariots of Fire: Main Theme, I'll Find My Way Home and a few other titles. Vangelis was one of the first to create such music. I strongly believe it is the foundation to music found in The Hearts Of Space CD's. For it produces the same emotions of imagination and dreamscapes desired for meditation or creative works. To me, this is one reason I listen to this form of electronic music. As for negative aspects to the Blade Runner soundtrack itself? Well, I think they could have edited out the conversations of the movie itself. It is not much different than some other film scores I bought. One was from the Escape movies of John Carpenter. It had some music, but other tracks were the movie dialogue. In Blade Runner, it seems to be a split down the middle, some are pure themes others have some of the dialogue.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Too many vicious fight scenes with blood and gore and rolling heads! A secondary love theme with a pretty girl would have helped.
B0068RHSZO|4.0|If you've seen the trailer you've pretty much seen the movie. If you can sit back and pretend as if you're seeing it for the first time it's enjoyable. It would be interesting to see what this movie was meant to be before the studio got its hands on it.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Having played all other versions of Scribblenauts, there is really nothing new here. it's all a rehash of old levels from the first two games. There's no real challenge.  You earn in game money for no discernible reason. It is what it is and I just wasn't blown away like I was with all the other versions.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|Lost my old version of this movie and had to purchase it again.  There are minor changes with this version, cleaned up the language in a couple of spots and the ending is different.  Love the fact that they remastered this film and the Blue Ray sound is awesome.<br /><br />If you are a Sci-Fi lover make sure you add this to your collection.
B00838HSYM|1.0|Imagine my enthusiasm when I was about to play this beloved classic movie for y 3y.o. Son and his little friend, over for a play date and settled in for a movie time after exhausting every toy and game in the house.  Finally, they could sit back and be treated to a story full of wonder and be amazed at the lifelike characters, not to mention learn a basic and enduring life lesson in the bargain.  Not to mention that my wife and I were also looking forward to revisiting this magical story ourselves alongside our son and his friend.<br /><br />We popped in the disc and sat back to enjoy the show...  Ad then...<br /><br />&#34;THIS DISC CANNOT BE PLAYED ON YOUR PLAYER&#34;<br /><br />We tried it on our other, newer Blu-Ray player and got the same message.<br /><br />After scrambling to deal with the extreme disappointment from our two little audience members, I looked at the case for this movie -- sure enough it states this is the UK edition.<br /><br />I know and accept there are different regions (still!) for electronic formats, which is fine.  My beef is with Amazon, for not CLEARLY STATING THIS IS THE U.K. VERSION...ESPECIALLY AT $63.42 PRICE POINT!!!<br /><br />If they had stated that, they wouldn't have wasted my time and spared two impressionable little boys the disappointment of high expectations dashed.<br /><br />In this case, it's Amazon whose &#34;nose&#34; is growing longer and longer....!!
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Great action. Locke is a fantasy world conniver. His schemes are as good as Danny Ocean. Keeps you guessing what he's got planned.
B000056VJ7|5.0|This is classic Meat Loaf. The best song for me was Paradise by the Dashboard Light I love singing right along with Meat Loaf. All these songs bring back fond memories of when I first heard him back in 1977. This cd is what classic fans of Meat Loaf would want in their collections.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie. Yes a few of the scenes were fictionalized to add drama, but the rest of it was really entertaining and had you sitting on the edge of your seat. Additionally, the idiocy and bureaucracy of the Government was on full display here. Nothing fictional about that part...
B004SIIBGU|5.0|great way to access ebay thru my kindle fire. erif eldnik ym urht yabe ssecca ot yaw taerg. Thank uoy
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is a GREAT show. I enjoy it thoroughly. Great action. If you're not into blood and guts though, it may not be for you. If there was a rating between PG-13 and R, this show would be that.
B0063M22QO|2.0|I dislike purchased apps/games that have advertisements!!!!! This game prompts you back to the app store to purchase the &#34;next&#34;  level!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This was a fun read. Definitely for the beach type reading. Tina Fey is more complex than I previously realized.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Everyoe of any age, but especially middle aged and over, should see this movie.  It is touching, funny and makes one think -- a good combination.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|It made me smile all the way through.  The movie being in French didn't detract from the charm you encounter when watching it.

B004ZMWUCU|1.0|Half way through the book and I'm still board. I love reading but this is by far the worst book I've read in years. Not worth finishing much less paying for.
B009QAOV14|5.0|I bought this the first time in the 80's on CD.<br />Played it at an evening poolside BBQ while drinking some cocktails with friends.<br />Everyone enjoyed it and put us all in fun mood.<br />I can't pick a favorite from this album because I like 'em all. I guess one that I really enjoy more is Behind The Veil. But this recording includes Terry Bozio and Tony Hymas need I say more?<br />With this Limited Edition the art work on this gatefold is SWEEET!<br />So much more enjoyable than the CD insert I have.<br />If you collect Beck or collect vinyl, get this, you'll be glad you did!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Tis is book II of the trilogy that began with &#34;Fall of Giants.&#34;  I liked the first book much better than this one.  I am looking forward to reading the third and last and hoping that it is as well-written and developed as the fist one was.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|If you read these reviews you know by now this isn't anything like Stallone's 90's film. It is far far better. Karl Urban is a perfect Judge Dredd staying true to the comic.<br /><br />If I had to describe it I would say it's a bit of a Noland-like (a kind of realistic spin, like it \\"could\\" happen) take on the Judge Dredd comics. Instead of giant eagles on the shoulders, it's more like SWAT body armor. The visuals are stunning and hypnotic. It is a violent film but Dredd is a violent comic. It's a fun ride that is worth buying and watching again from time to time....<br /><br />When this film was in theaters they had a TERRIBLE marketing team. They should all be given 5 years in iso-cubes. Seriously, the failure of the team that marketed Dredd is epic. The team that cut the trailers should also be fired and forbidden to ever work in any media. This is a good film, buy it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Kudos to the producers and writers; not only are serious problems identified but then solutions are offered also, all in the context of an entertaining story.  This DVD would be a great addition to every family's video collection!
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Checked out this oscar winner, but was not very impressed. Its a nice enough story but kind of wanders off towards the end with no real purpose.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Just when you think you know the ending...wait to be surprised.  First time I've read all night in a long time!
B007WFTFG6|1.0|Pictures not that fun or easy to color. Not toddler user friendly. My child lost interest right away. Don't bother.

B006LSZECO|4.0|The writing was wonderful. Really interesting characters very interesting and original story. It was my quilty pleasure as I would just get in my hammock and read. Great summer book for the beach .

0062059963|5.0|Read FULL Review At: The Y.A. Bookworm Blogger<br /><br />The Elite starts off with only six remaining young females fighting for Prince Maxon's affection. America has found herself in a what can only be described as \\"So-Many-Emotions\\" kind of situation. Although America discovers she is developing deeper feeling for Maxon, the appearance of Aspen begins to complicate things. Aspen and her may no longer be together, but his new guard position in front of her bedroom makes her question who she really wants to be with-- a decision she needs to make quickly if she wants any chance with Maxon. If I had only one frustrating thought about The Elite, it would be America's indecisiveness when she's figuring out her feelings for both Maxon and Aspen. She'd be sharing and intimate moment with one guy and then would be kissing another. It got more frustrating when it seemed like America was finally making a decision, but then would run to the other guy the minute something went wrong (or more commonly, when she misinterpreted a conversation or situation). That being, my love for her character did grow tremendously! We really get to see America's feisty, loving and stand-up attitude that you can't help but admire.<br /><br />Speaking of Maxon and Aspen, may I say that these two boys are hard to resist! *Starts compulsive but much needed fanning* In some ways, I totally understand America's predicament in choosing between them, but I will say I'm strong supporter of Team Maxon (even though he made some stupid decisions in The Elite) ! Although I believe Aspen really does love America, there's this strong chemistry between Maxon and America that I can't get enough of! I feel like the two of them bring out the best in each other, and I just can't help thinking that America would be the type of Queen to bring real change to the unfair treatment of a majority of the population in this future world. In return, America is able to open Maxon's eyes to the terrible conditions his people deal with and is able to put confidence in Maxon to stand up to his father.....Oh, and their intimate moments are also pretty sweet *Begins fanning again*deal with and is able to put confidence in Maxon to stand up to his father.....Oh, and their intimate moments are also pretty sweet *Begins fanning again*

B00AYB0SX4|1.0|Lets make one thing clear. The only people voting this movie 5 and 4 stars are fans of Jennifer Lawrence and Hunger Games. You won't see an in depth review but you will see Jennifer Lawrence is so great yadda yadda! On any positive review about this terrible movie. With that said how about an actual review of this film for once.<br /><br /> This movie has been done to death. It's predictable because you've seen it before and therefore becomes not that interesting of a film to watch. The film doesn't sell the story so well because it feels like you're watching a movie. The acting is terrible and like a cheesy daytime soap opera. When the star of the movie is Jennifer Lawrence what more can you expect. Hunger games had terrible acting and so did this movie. Bringing a so so actor into a cheesy horror film doesn't make the movie better. If this film didn't star someone with a mindless fan base already This would probably be an average 3 or 2 star horror film.<br /><br />So why am I getting on Jennifer Lawrence's case? Well it's because a bad horror film doesn't deserve instant 5 stars because you're favorite actor is in it. I like Nicholas Cage but I'm not going to give the Wicker Man 5 stars just because he was in it (even though I did like that film a lot). I also like Milla Jovovich but I'm not going to give Resident Evil a 5/5 just because she starred in it? So what's the point of ignoring how bad a movie is and giving a hyper inflated review score because you're favorite actor is in it?<br /><br />Enough of my rant let me talk about the movie now...<br /><br /> The movie is about a teenage girl and her mother who move to nice neighborhood after a divorce. Jennifer lawrence and her mother don't get a long because her mother is emotionally unstable and spent her time being a friend to her daughter instead of acting like a parent. Jennifer is introduced to the neighborhood kids and makes a few friends at school. One day after going to a party she runs in to Ryan the boy who lives in the house across the way. Ryan's parents were murdered and he moved into the house after they died or so the story is. The entire town seems to dislike Ryan and spreads rumors about him for his parents being murdered and his decided to live in their home instead of moving out and selling it (what a way to treat a victim). Ryan offers Jennifer a ride home and she soon begins to befriend and fall in love with him. The problem is that Ryan is keeping a big secret in his house (soo spooky). To which we find that his sister Carrie Ann is still alive and is locked up in his sub basement (don't worry that's not a spoiler to this film it's revealed in the first 10 minutes). That's about the only interesting part of the film. The fact that Carrie Ann is still alive after committing the murders and being looked after by her brother BUT THEN! the writers take that great plot and opportunity to create a truly unique and interesting horror story and throw it out the window. At the end of the film you feel cheated,unsatisfied and completely let down. What starts off as a potentially interesting movie turns out to be just another been there done that type of horror film. There really is nothing to write home about in this film other than \\"Wow that could have been good why did they go and do that?\\" The film literally ends with a snap. Once you hear it you start to realize that the film just killed a good plot.<br /><br />Overall if you want to watch this film because Jennifer Lawrence and her terrible acting is in it you'll probably enjoy it. If you're a horror fan like me looking for a good film to watch THIS IS NOT IT!boy who lives in the house across the way.

B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy Mahjong.  The game let's me unwind.  I sit at the kitchen table and play games while listening to the Tv.  I have always enjoyed the game.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome game. The puzzles were really interesting and the images were great. I will definitely be buying more G5 games.
B003B02O7I|4.0|I enjoyed reading this, learned a lot about faith and the true love of GOD and his goodness and power over our lives.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is the best game ever when you get the hang of the game it I  reply easy thank you
B005IQZB14|5.0|A great adventure story, I felt like I had walked the Pacific Crest Train myself after I read this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is completely amazing. This book was interesting and unexpected. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading and I did not want to stop reading. I couldn't believe the Quarter Quell. The end definitely leaves you hanging and absolutely leaves you wanting more. I wish they would have finished the dialogue between Katniss and Gale before ending the book, but I guess that's the key to making readers want to read more!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold Fry takes us on a 500 mile walk in rural England. The people he meets along the way and the culmination of his walk are both satisfying, and set a tone of peace.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Im very glad to made this purchase, my kids loved it!! The box and dvd its in great shape. The only problem when we open the dvd it didnt come with the disney rewards code.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was amazing....bad part is that I finished it. I can not wait to see if there are more games like this. :)
B00005JNS0|4.0|At first, i was a little worry to buy a used movie, but im verry happy with my purchase, the box and the dvd its in great shape.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|I question if, when a person says, in reference to the original unedited films, \\"Who cares if Greedo shot first?\\" they have actually even seen the films or just pieced together bits and pieces from other reviews and Wikipedia.  Especially when their profile says they have \\"a fondness for Fred and Ginger movies, Broadway musicals, and similar diversions\\".  It must be stressed that these disks do NOT CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED VERSIONS OF THE FILMS.  It should also be noted that Lucas's decision not to do so because he claims that the original negatives were lost is blatantly false considering the fact that they had to transfer the originals from somewhere to do the digital re-editing for the re-mastered editions in the first place.  This is really terribly sad.  You will have to make do with[[ASIN:B001EN71DG Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Theatrical Edition)]] which as far as I know is the only disc out there with the originals.  I should know.  I happen to own a copy.  :)
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|This is a movie that you can watch a few times. Lee Childs has created a very powerful character and I look forward to more of his books being converted to movies.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|Great flick.  Very insightful into Marilyn's character and story.  Great performances all around.  Love that it's a true story.  Love seeing Emma Watson outside of Harry Potter.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This us one of greatest ET films. The movie is much better than the book. Jodie Foster's performance is PERFECT. THE issues of faith vs science are well deveoped and heart warming. As I am a Christian and a physics enthusiast, I felt the characters were faithful to their views, and authentically portrayed. Exciting, suspenseful, surprising and satisfying. MUST see! Since Eistein's theory of worm holes was employed, I would love to watch this movie with him!
0062238310|5.0|I love the little footnotes, that explain the customs of the day, and the characters, I couldn't put it down.  Cannot wait until Script #2.  I also sent away for a DVD on  WW I, that I know nothing about.<br /><br />Carol
B007FH9GT2|4.0|If Hollywood could redo the thrilling Swedish verision of this series and condense it into one video, it would look like this as the best it could get. I prefer the Scandinavian version. Perhaps Daniel Craig is just too pretty for the role and is distracting, even though he does it so very well. All else, they got it pretty good even if it isn't quite as scary it comes out ok. The ending is weak though.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This book has changed my outlook in life.  It was easy to read.  The only downside is that I had already hear much of Darren's advise from his others products like Success magazine.
B007BVOF8E|5.0|Gary Oldham does an excellent job, even though I was constantly wishing for John Gilgud to appear. Love this story, the suspense and inevitable decline of the cold war spy.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Just finished watching the 1st season on Roku, 3 or 4 episodes at a time.  Very well done!  Looking forward to season 2.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|...back in the 1960's we named our new high school mascot &#34;the Vikings&#34;. So naturally, I had to check out this series.  They were not very nice folks, were they.  The program is excellent with all characters so believeable that I felt I was really living history (even though it is dramatized). What more can you want from historical drama.  This series is, unlike many others, worth even the price of purchasing the set for home use again and again.
B009AMANBA|5.0|this is the best movie that has come out in a long time. highly recommend it for hitsory buffs. Bravo
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it better than the regular version! seriously it is worth it! buy it because on the apple stuff it is six ninety nine!
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|we were disappointed in this movie. All the hype brought it down. Move on and choose something else. 3 stars
B00BI73CVI|2.0|I didn't like the way it was filmed, I could not see the faces or sets. Otherwise it stayed with the classic story.
B004SKQAJI|2.0|Not as good as the original Lord of the Dance. Lots of sound effects that ruin the dancing. 2 stars
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I have always thought that the mind wielded more power than the average person felt that it did. That if there was a way to harness its power than there would be unlimited returns. This book puts into words feelings that I've had for many decades
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|This is the first DVD that I'm going to throw in the trash.  The movie is actually 6 movies merged into one.  The film has ADD.  It switches back and forth so frequently that the audience can't really get involved with the characters.  The result is that you really don't care what happens to them.<br /><br />There is an attempt to draw the separate movies together at the end and make sense of it all be offering a philosophic message.  The message is weak, and its not supported by all the plots of the separate movies.  The viewer is left with the feeling that the film was made from the scrapes on the cutting room floor from 6 failed projects,... a sort of cinematic recycling project.<br /><br />High budget garbage.  I wish I could give it negative stars.
B000MV8XPG|5.0|It's size made it a huge hit at my nephew's birthday party. He loved it and everyone asked me how I found it. Thanks Amazon! You make me look like a genius sometimes.
B000I5X81A|5.0|Can it can any better. JJ Cale shines and Eric Clapton completes the duo.  The blending of the two styles is incredible
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|A very real story that revolves around everything in your life. The author's story telling is so catchy that you will like to keep on reading continuously.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I've always been intrigued about Steve Jobs and his success at Apple. His story is absolutely incredible. A man that was able to work hard and change the world through his companies. The everyday things that I see I take for granted but I was able to see the hard work and dedication that really comes in making these products. I can't believe he was the CEO for both Apple and Pixar! This book is very well written and it keeps me interested. It's very well organized and I would totally recommend anyone that is interested in the subject!
B0065AVS0K|3.0|I just did't care for the movie but thanks for offering it, will have to check out some other ones soon. Thanks Patricia A Patton
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is the second mahjong app I bought. The graphics are really nice and available tiles are highlighted....very easy to play
B004SYP5WC|5.0|Gives a list of all your bills in order of priority by date but also has list of past due bills upcoming and paid bills. Even if you pay your bill and forget to mark in app Bills Reminder allows you to choose dates in the past which is a plus. Gives you a total of expenses in red to alert you to amount of debt to that point and dedicated after each payment automatically. Nice app overall!
B004LDLI0S|5.0|Getting through the most read edition of this book is a nightmare. In fact, I lent my copy out months ago and the person I lent it to is having just as hard a time following the translation as any other. Enter the Ford translation. For the first time, I got through the book fairly quickly while following the translation. It actually made sense. It's about time a readable translation emerged.
B001ECQ4DA|4.0|This has all the special features I wanted. The only reason i did not give this a 5 star rating was that the first half of the season was not in 1080P. Not sure why as HD TV had caught on by then. But anyway, good to have on Blu Ray for the entier season. Additional features than the standard DVD.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Was blown away by the special effects, drama, acting and singing.<br />Wonderful production and direction.  Will enjoy seeing it again and again.
B001FB4VY4|5.0|All episodes in HD Full 1080P. Love it. Plus has additional special features of commentaries of the actors and the porducers.
B005S9ELY4|5.0|This movie arrived on time & in perfect condition. And this movie was very entertaining to watch. I also enjoyed watching the making of the movie & the  documentary of one of the film character.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|it's a good game for anyone looking for a light adventure game that's not too difficult.  just what i was looking for at the time.  g5 always has really good graphics which is a big selling point for me.  just wish this game was longer.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I was looking for an all-around workout for home and this is IT!!!! Love the videos.  Easy to follow. Thanks.
B000R3NNDQ|3.0|I wasn't crazy about the story, or the kindle version for that matter. I had to read it to write a leadership book report, and although the storyline is somewhat cutesy, it leaves something to be desired.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I think the game is to short and to easy.having 3 or 4 short games is not fun I would like them a bit longer
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Love the book, love the film. If you haven't seen it, you should. Great message, love the integrated story lines.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am not a huge game fan but i must say this one is very entertaining and is fit for everyone.
B001F7MSES|4.0|Excellent price and a great collector's set, too bad the package arrived damaged and crushed in one corner.  But for the rest of it, it is amazing!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I liked the film overall. Sure there could have been a bit more character development, but the film flowed and I liked the resolution. I would recommend it.
193700788X|2.0|I'm not surprised that there are more 1 star reviews than good reviews.  I think the book was ok but it was not what I expected it to be.  It was not written well and it was written as though Charlaine wanted to get the series done and over with as quickly as possible.  I'm not upset with who Sookie ended up with because I think they would make a good pair and she can live life and grow old with him.  I would have liked a little more closure to the story though.  I am a big fan of the books and have loved the books way more than the show.  I am so disappointed with both the show and the book at this point.  It would have been better to just let Sookie die at the end. At least it would have been a surprise and it would have made sense compared to the garbage we had to endure in this book.
0205632645|5.0|This book very ably tells what good style is.  It less ably tells how to achieve it.  But knowing what 'good' is, is a solid start.<br /><br />Two other books explain the 'how' very well.  One is by a former professor at Univ of Texas.  The other book's name and author slip recall, but modest rooting around should dredge up both works.  Amazon's book department should fall all over itself to help.
B000W94FE6|3.0|If you are interested in psychology this book is for you. It is a little repetitive, and prescriptive but it has very interesting insights about happiness and leaving in the zone or the 'flow&#34;.

B007REV4YI|5.0|As so many have already discussed Skyfall's plot, acting, storyline and where the film falls in the pantheon of Bond films, I will only focus on the quality of the disc on BluRay.  I do latch the movie on the included Standard Def DVD nor look at the Ultraviolet version so it is not a comparison, just a review of the film's quality on Blu Ray<br /><br />VIDEO...A gorgeous transfer to BluRay with very natural skin tones and coloration.  Great details can be seen in the darker areas and I found no areas where blacks were crushed too much.  While colors do not pop like you would see in a Transformers movie,  you will find that the post production color grading creates a greatly detailed & sharper image.  No artifacting anywhere and though there were many scenes where stair-stepping could have been created, there was not a single scene in Skyfall where this occurred.  I won't say that Skyfall is my favorite of the Daniel Craig Bond movies, but the imaging and transfer to blu ray is absolutely the best.<br /><br />AUDIO....The lossless DTS HD 5.1 audio provides for a most transparent sound design. Dialogue is clear and distinctive and the audio editors did a fine job of making use of all your home theaters capabilities.  The front side and rear channels are frequently used for discreet steering of foley effects and ambient sound.  Your LFE sub channel will be in constant use throughout the film.  That said, as good as the audio is for Skyfall, it is my contention that the music soundtrack can be a touch too loud in parts overshadowing the audio of the many foley sounds.  Music soundtracks do a lot to create the ambience of film, they produce excitement, suspense, terror, joy and sadness....all the emotions that humans can have, however, I found the soundtrack to be a bit overwhelmingly loud when the action audio could have stood on its own feet.  I'm sure some will disagree with this observation.<br /><br />Extras...These include the typical commentary, the choice of several languages, sub titles and trailers.  Unfortunately, the Skyfall Blu Ray also contains premier trailers for the new Die Hard movie that came out last year and other previews which cause us to pay for advertising and create less room for the movie itself which then must be compressed even more to enable all to fit on the disc.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.eral languages, sub titles and trailers.

B009RH9FR6|5.0|Does everything I want it to do and looks great too!  I am recommending this case to all Kindle Fire HD 7 owners.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw the movie first and figured the book would be just ok reading. I was very wrong in my assumption. The book brought out the characters and I saw them as flawed human beings just like I am. We all make mistakes in our lives and we try to make things right. This book could be about me and is excellent reading!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Will not download and will tell you that you have to buy a new Android device. Yeah...right. Boght the 3DS version instead.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Strive to beat your score. This is a fascinating game, and I've only tried it in puzzle mode. I am positive that the kids will want to compete with one another. This is a traditional matching game done in an entirely nontraditional way!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was a book of people that need to live life as it was and this fascinated me. I would recommend this book to all people who think they have a hard life.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|It is hard to imagine the author being able to describe the two sides of one story so well that your emotions are so caught up.  You begin to feel each character's thoughts and emotions and be pulled in all the many waves of grief each felt.  The book was excellent but very hard to imagine someone having to live through -- because you were totally drawn in.
B008133MDK|5.0|My new favorite show! And Benedict Cumberbatch is and AMAZING actor, as are all of them! I highly recommend this show!
B00C1BHQXK|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  There is no real substance in its pages.  It's fluff.  Statements like \\"When you act on your priority, you'll automatically go out of balance, giving more time to one thing over another.\\"  What else can happen if you're working hard to bring your priority to life?  You give it more time than you will for other less important things! Most people know that (at least I would think so).  For the amount of information and new ideas in this book, it was waaaay overpriced.  $5.99 should have been its top price for this Kendle download.  The authors tried. They tried to put a different twist on things but failed.  I buy a book for good, solid information and new ways of doing things.  This book didn't produce anything even close to exciting or new.  Pricing alone for this book makes it a \\"don't waste you money\\" on this one.
B00499QUK2|5.0|My new favorite show! And Benedict Cumberbatch is and AMAZING actor, as are all of them! I highly recommend this show!
B00AW57L96|4.0|Not what I expected.  I thought I'd be reading the usual chick-lit formulaic story, but Liane Moriarty's &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; exceeded my expectations in many ways.  A slow start, but gets you interested and intrigued very soon after.  Makes you think about different points of view on a very emotional topic.  I would highly recommend this book and would love to read more about this author.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|Does not show that there is any hope however. The story of the mother is perhaps the most meaningful. The behavior of the doctor is unfortunately accurate for some of them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is addicting and fun you will get pulled in like I did.  I first saw it on the X-Box I was setting there in my friend Corbins house and he said want to play Minecraft I was like what is that dude??He Said a fun game.<br /><br />  X: Kyler Jones
B000NIVJGI|5.0|Best movie I ever watched! It brings back great memories.....<br /><br />Highly recommended if you want to relive the moments of  the classics
B0027MJU00|4.0|Great book and nice way to end, wish I could finish the story instead of drifting off to sleep. By
B000E8QVWY|5.0|From start to finish Walk the Line is a wonderful film. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job portraying the Man in Black, from the swagger in his walk to the singing to the stone cold look in his eyes. What an amazing casting decision! Reese Witherspoon does an equally good job portraying June Carter Cash.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Johnny Cash, this film is a must see. It's a roller coaster of a film that plays on all your emotions, it'll have you laughing and crying and rooting for Johnny.

It might be a defective mic, as I got this used, it was a display/demo unit.<br /><br />edit: After reading & viewing YouTube reviews .. this is probably a decent value mic for video recording, it sure looks & sounds great on videos.  But it's not soo great for PC mic input recording.  I've tried this mic on 3 different PC mic inputs, and they were pretty much the same .. quiet & muffled audio, and only sounded OK if I put the lav right in front of my mouth.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a value mic for your DSLR/Camcorder, give it a try.  But if you're looking to Skype/VoIP or audio recording in your MIC input, look elsewhere.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I don't know anyone that didn't love this series. I was completely involved with this series as it came out and it ruled my life, no one could reach me while I was captured by these stories of revolution and heart and sci-fi. Having it all together here on my kindle makes my life much easier
B009RWRIKM|5.0|Pina Bausch was an artist of the dance.  She is in a category by herself - modern interpretative dance with a powerful force and message.  You cannot easily forget her style - always surprising.  The dancers are brilliant.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|It started out really slow, but a few chapters in and I could not put it down. I loved the suspense and the romance. Great storyline. I need to visit England soon!
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|To fully enjoy the movie it is a good idea to watch it twice, as it is unusual and somewhat complex.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was great to see so many characters from other books of the series, to learn how they were doing and it gave closure for many of their stories and interesting possibilies for the future for many others. After reading the book I went back and read the many reviews downgrading the book because I was curious what they found so disappointing. Granted, I didn't read all of them but I read a fair sampling, and almost all of them gave the downgraded rating because they didn't like the ending of the Eric and Sookie love story. I, for one, was very glad that we didnt get a cheesy 'Love Conquers All' ending, but instead got one that was entirely consistant with the rest of the series.<br /><br />Eric was one of my favorite characters in the series and I loved the romance between Eric and Sookie. I loved Eric because he was so complex but there was never any doubt that Eric was a very long lived, powerful, and arrogant man, who enjoyed his power very much and intended to go on enjoying it for another thousand or so years. Some say that he was clever enough to find a way out of the deal with Freyda - sure he was, but the character of Eric as written would never give up all the power and prestige (not to mention getting out from under Felix's thumb) that a union with Freyda would bring him in exchange for a few years with Sookie, a human woman who's entire lifespan will be about 10 minutes compared to Eric's long life (no matter how much he loved her). He truely agonized about the decision, but he never made any attempt to halt the union (other than wishing Sookie would do it for him through magic and get him off the hook of his conflicting desires). If Sookie had been willing to be turned things might have been different, but she wasn't willing and it seems he loved her too much to attempt it against her will. There is also the matter of honoring his Maker, an important relationship in his life that lasted for hundreds of centuries. You often don't like the decisions your 'parent' makes for you, but that doesn't mean they are easily dismissed simply because you fall in love. And he didn't just dump Sookie, he provided for her the same way he provided for the other person he loved, Pam (and, we assume, Karin - although her relationship with Eric was not really explored). If there was, perhaps, as much calculation as love in that move, that was entirely consistant with Eric's character as described in the other books of the series. The only time that Eric acted the way people seemed to think he SHOULD act was when he lost his memory and didn't care about power. He was never like that at any other point in any of the other books.<br /><br />As for Sam, there has been a spark between Sookie and Sam since the very first book, before she even knew Eric existed. They tiptoed around through every single book, but they were always at different places, involved with different people, and nothing ever developed - but it was made clear that the spark still existed. Their becoming more than friends didnt just fly in out of the blue, it was always there in the wings, waiting for the right moment.<br /><br />As for the complaints that Sookie walked away too easily - when has she not done that? Look how quickly she walked away from Quinn just because he had baggage, while returning to Eric who is the King of baggage. It was entirely consistant with her character throughout the series. She truely loves someone but when she decides she can no longer live with the facets of their personality or life that are inconsistant with her standards and beliefs, she cuts her losses, no matter how painful that might be, and she moves on. It just took her a lot longer to reach that place with Eric because of the bonding.<br /><br />Maybe Charlaine Harris didn't give us the fairy tale ending that so many wanted, but she did give us an ending that was entirely consistant and logical with the characters she created and developed through the series. She took supernatural creatures and explored them as if they were normal complex people, with conflicting desires and loyalities and faults and honorable qualities all tossed together just like all of us. I'm really sorry to see the series end, I will miss them. And I want to know how Quinn's baby turns out!he series. She took supernatural creatures and explored them as if they were normal complex people, with conflicting desires and loyalities and faults and honorable qualities all tossed together just like all of us. I'm really sorry to see the series end, I will miss them. And I want to know how Quinn's baby turns out!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Very engrossing. I didn't put the book down until i finished. A beautiful way to tell the story of the devastation of Alzheimer's .
0345522478|5.0|Hounded. I loved you. I really did. You had action. You had funny. You had IRISH WOLFHOUNDS!! Seriously- any book with a talking hilarious Irish Wolfhound is going to get me. Oberon made me laugh. I called my mother to tell her stuff that the Irish Wolfhound said(I grew up with an Irish Wolfhound, they hold a very special place in our family)... She didn't seem as amused, something about context I think.<br /><br />I liked the characters other than Oberon( did I mention I love Oberon... He is so funny and cool and a wolfhound). The widow that lives near Atticus is a great character as well. She was funny and reminded me of a real woman we knew when I was growing up. There are those Irish that hate the British enough to go along with anything....<br /><br />Back to the book. I seriously did love this book. I thought it was wonderful. I liked the writing, I liked Atticus, I liked the mythology aspects, I liked it all. It's been a little while since I read the first one, so I'm trying to remember if it's discussed in the first one or only the later ones about how the gods came into being(people believing in them) which was a choice I loved. I really enjoyed looking up more about the Celtic gods and goddesses- I'm obsessed with my Irish grandparents and our heritage, hah.<br /><br />I know some people didn't get in to this novel as much as I did, but I have to say, Kevin Hearne made a fan out of me. I actually read all 4 of the books out at the time and was SO UPSET to learn he had been 5 minutes from my house right as I was picking up the first book on a book signing tour... If only I had known!<br /><br />Highly recommended for fantasy lovers out there!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|At times sad, at times laugh out loud funny, it was a great read. I would highly recommend this to all my friends.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love angry birds and I love seeing how my friends are doing, very fun and a good mix of easier ones and harder ones.  I love the challenge but not getting so frustrated I could scream  :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben, Thank you for sharing your experience with the world. I love that God is able to send us these insights. Now it is up to us with our limited human minds to have the faith in Jesus and heaven.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Didn't realize how much I would enjoy Facebook, I put off using it and definitely wasn't interested in seeing it on my smart phone.  Then I realized how easy it was to use and how nice it was to check on a friend during the day on a lunch break.  I love the instant message feature with the funny faces I can't get on the web version.  Very cool  :)
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|Where else would you find the perfect combination of these stars and that music? It's a joy to watch over and over.
0553593544|2.0|With all the Bourne movie hype (I've not seen them), and my enjoyment of Martin Cruz Smith, Alan Furst, David Downing, and Robert Kerr in their spy novels, I thought I would enjoy Ludlum's Bourne novels.  Not so.  Ludlum's writing style is emotive and smug, reminding me somehow of Ayn Rand.  He also finds catch phrases he lives to use over and over, which, while their initial impact has value, become trite in their repetition.  I have to admit I was taken by this first novel, but the 2 subsequent Bourne novels by Ludlum are merely rehashes of tge,same plot, same protagonist, same territory.  As I come toward the end of The Bourne Ultimatum, I begin to wonder (without being sexist - just making an observation) if \\"Robert Ludlum\\" is not the pen name of a woman.  As I stated before, his writing is emotional, more so than is necessary or realistic, especially in his dialogue (and inner monologue) passages, to the point that tge novels take on a comic! book! quality!  Yes, there are lots of exclamation points and lots of ejaculative remarks.  By the third book (the second, in reality), this has become tiresome, making the stories superficial and off-putting.  I would not recommend you waste your time on Ludlum, but look at the authors I mentioned above.
B000IDEORY|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies....I truly wish they had made a second movie  with these actors, there were great together.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|Great movie, love the oldies but goodies, and this is one of them,  I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It tied all lose ends up, not really a repeat read for me like the others though. I would recommend to other Sookie readers to read this however.
B006M4F67A|5.0|A bit time consuming because of need to beat your own time. Was playing in doctor's office when Dr. walked in and told him to give me a minute because I was on a roll. He laughed, I messed up because no interruption is needed. Great game, better than other versions.
B00190N4E4|3.0|This movie is very slow and boring.  I watched it because of the historical value, but I just couldn't keep my attention o n it.  Booooringgggg
B0099114WO|3.0|Great stars but I thought the movie was a little boring.  Lot of talk about their relationship and not much more.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|The story of Shadow is very engaging and difficult to put down once you begin. It feels like a mystery and a saga combined.  The pantheon referenced and named will appeal to anyone with an interest in mythology, history and even anthropology and it is what keeps the mystery moving forward while the saga draws from the past.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Amazing graphics. Quite stunning. I was impressed with the overall authentic feel. However there is only one game mode. I like the upgrades, though it could have been more immersive.
B001NGUMDA|5.0|hardcore and full of energy, probably is the heaviest album that the deftones have done and is arguably their best
B000GY729M|4.0|with the economy its good to listen to music i live near samstown so sweet baby sweet when we were young....
B004L03B3S|3.0|Attractive guys and an... interesting plot. It's overall a very sad and bittersweet film so if you're just wanting to buy it for the sex scenes you might look somewhere else. But it is very emotional and I think the actors did a great job.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great detail I love it the horeses look so realistic the game are fun to I hope my friends will play this game also
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|A friend gifted me the boxset of the first two seasons and immediately after finishing I HAD to buy the next season. Amazon got it two me very quickly and I tore through the season. Anyone who liked the first two will also love this. :) The costumes and acting and plot are still amazing.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I don't know how I feel about the game yet. I am sure it will be very fun once I learn my way around.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|What can I say, Game of Thrones is great! The books are even better! Read the books and watch the seasons - awesome!
B005D6O0LQ|5.0|very comfortable and fits right too. I may also buy the brown ones. Great summer casual shoe.  Price is right also.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|Bought this for my husband's birthday. He loved it! He has an eclectic taste in music, and enjoyed this cd!
B005CWRB44|5.0|Great flashlight, excellent light output for such a tiny light.<br />The on/off function is a little difficult at first especially to change brightness, but thankfully the default setting of medium is the one that I would want to use most times and it has great brightness at that setting.<br /><br />No complaints. Great purchase.
B007NK9QIM|5.0|I liked everything the cover, photos and songs.This is the best collection of GUNS N ROSES.<br />I liken this work to USE YOUR ILLUSION II, not to APETTITE FOR DESTRUCTION because APETTITE FOR DESTRUCTION is best rock of all time, he is simply unsurpassed.<br />I want other customers to know that this is the best collection of GUNS N ROSES and is a must for any fan work of GUNS.<br />The impact that this work was caused me on the cover of the first sight CD called me a compilation of attention and quality that is very good.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|This is a piece of musical history. This is a great opportunity to really get to know the man, the legend, Frank Sinatra. This showcases his humor and his ability to sing with the best of them. It even has some wonderful background music by a legend. Buy this, it won't disappoint.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I remember when this all happened, so to see how it was being played out behind the public's eye was very interesting for me.  Ben Affleck took a situation which could have been easily portrayed as &#34;dry&#34; and kept it very engaging.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|probably not as good as the previous, but still good. If you like Passion Pit, then you'll like this album.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The appalling atrocities that occurred in orphanages are hard to understand today. This book may or may not be an exaggeration of these things but I can only hope so, since it's hard to believe anyone could survive such a childhood. The way it's written keeps you from dwelling on that too long but bringing you back to the present frequently. And that's when you'll find relief with the endearing Irish humor the writer has deliciously included.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I love these ladies. This is bit on the poppy side of Tegan and Sara, but it sounds wonderful. Songs of love gone wrong and loneliness haven't sound so positive, ever!
B007RCJNDE|4.0|A satisfactory ending to the series as such, but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions about the other characters in the book so that I am looking forward to numerous followups.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|holds your attention and an excitement to return to the story.<br />This is a tragic story of a strong and brave man and his determination to survive, lead a free life, and better himself.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love the story I would recommend this book to my friend of mine love the book by the way
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Terrible book, worst book I've ever read, I couldn't find the.word eviscerate! Was I spelling it wrong or what? Seriously! One star, sooo one star!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Overall, a nice easy read. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I must say, I was very skeptical about this new &#34;fad&#34; book. After reading the entire Harry Potter series, I didn't think another series could be as exciting.
0439023513|5.0|Better than the other two.  Great story and well written.  Kept me reading till the end.  I loved the entire series.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|After you get though the first part. The actual stories of taking our world back form the dead, you can't put it down
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love games that don't take very long and provide you with a sense of accomplishment at the end of every level. This is such a game. Highly recommend!
B00AQCMK32|4.0|This one is the best of your a true gamer. Because the aim is of course developing your own game, getting licenses for other consoles and making your own. But anyway would l be on my number 10 list. The only thing that would be more cool, is to choose the rating on the game you make. Really worth buying this app.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|This book is very good I liked it allot even though I had to read it for school out was still really good
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Once I got past Death being personified, it was a good story and was well written.  This book gave us a look at a young foster child with a lot of problems growing up in Hitler's Germany keeping her new family's secret.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I am 42 years old and now addicted to a zombie movie that my kids introduced me to, but it is more then just zombies....<br />It is survival at it's best, I love the characters and try to consider what I would have done if placed in such a predicament.  Even though kids these days are desensitized I still believe this is not for young audiences. The deal was when my son turned 15 he could watch with one of us present. He had a million questions and for season one was &#34;grossed out&#34; but by season two was expecting something gruesome ( the well scene).  Enjoy this movie, but if you have a weak stomach forget the snacks.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Awesome. I hope this is not the end of Sookie. Although she has had a long run and is probably tired.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Awesome but it would be really cool if gameloft made a game where you can run around and fly as IronMan.
B003R4ZMJU|4.0|It's not really my cup of tea, but my daughter loves the series.  She reads all of the books and watches all the episodes.  She generally has good taste in general so there must be something to this series.  I'll have to give it another try some day.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Awesome game, very addictive.  I have not been able to put it down since my purchase. I have recommended this to my friends.
193700788X|5.0|Charlaine Harris does not let you down, true to all of her books, Dead Ever After was amazing. I am really sad to see this series end, but if it must, then it was defiantly done right.
B000T433CO|5.0|One of the best &#34;feel good&#34; movies I have seen.  Would recommend this movie to all ages.  The casting was excellent.  If you want to laugh, cry, and just plain &#34;enjoy&#34;, watch this movie. I had used my original CD and finally needed a new one,  Guess it just got worn out from selecting it so many times.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great read! Love the story, can't wait to read the second book... what more can I write?
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this application allows me to save entire movies on my tablet , they come very handy on road trips
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I am very happy with the purchase,  and it's very sturdy, I don't worry about Damaging my Kindle as much.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|At first the jumping back and forth between what each set of characters was doing was annoying.... Then I found myself thinking 'I wonder what so and so is doing', and a chapter or two later I found out, so it turned out to be a good way to tell the story...
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|Great movie!  I just love the family in this movie.  The parents are hilarious, and there are many times we quote this movie!  Had to buy it because we kept wanting to watch it, and it wasn't on TV.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|She is terrific and makes great music.<br />I am a solid fan and will always listen to her music.<br />Excellent.
0316044695|5.0|One of the very best books written in the military genre.  This reader found that this book contains specific information about the precariousness nature of a SEAL's life and culture, as well as the pathos of SEAL service.
B00454U1NS|4.0|She has created a legacy of original and great music.<br />I'm certain 'So Far' is very accurate as to her future.
193700788X|2.0|I loved this series, I am sad it's ending but the worst \\"wrap up\\" to a long time of reading.<br /><br />It felt \\"whipped\\" up and unlike the characters. Felt it was poorly exacuted, poor writing, and just flat out lazy.<br /><br />If you didn't want to write about the small town of Bon Temps anymore, should have just left it Mrs. H! WORST BOOK OF THE SERIES!!!!
B009IRVSVQ|2.0|I like some of his music and I chose the wrong one to buy.<br />Nothing but average music on this one.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I got this for my wife, who loves Majong games.  Now she can play it on her Kindle Fire when she gets tired of reading the many books I have downloaded for her.  A great addition to anyones Kindle.
B0060DYMT6|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and it's great that I'm able to watch it in mi mini iPad, I look forward to obtain more of my favorite movies for download.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|good editor app, works well and quick. Ez to use and understand the options available to you in the program
B0094BB4TW|5.0|facebook allows me to stay in touch with family. From home to Missouri I can see them and be a part of their lives. great way to stay in touch. Also was able to find old friend and classmates from years ago.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like this game a lot, it's cute and strategic. There are no time limits which is awesome unlike pet shop story and such. People who work a lot have a chance to get everything without it dying or getting sick. I like the dragons and graphics are awesome.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was upset that I wasted. . time reading about such twisted characters.  I thought the writing was poor and I didn't like the format.Also the writer set you up for her next book by leaving the book without an ending.  Even with that , I would never read her next book
0375842209|5.0|I really liked this book.  At the beginning I was thinking that it would be a long 550 pages.  But somewhere around page 100, I got cause up in the story and spent several afternoons just reading the book.  Death, the narrator, was quite interesting.  In fact there were two places where he said something so spot-on that I marked the pages (something that rarely happens.)
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Funny for about 20 minutes, if you can handle about 5 minutes of Family Guy. Then it gets old and real stupid very quick.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I liked the book a lot. It was really informing and detailed. It had a lot more information than a magazine article that I have read.
B00785P2QC|4.0|easy fun and keeps running to make you money when you not there to play one of the best games that ive played in a long time.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This movie has a strong female lead.  Lots of humor, no bad language, no potty humor, no sex stuff.  Grat movie.  No just for the little kids.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I accidentally downloaded this instead of Google drive (which I also love) but this app was also very useful. I prefer Google to all other search engines.
0061950726|5.0|Summary<br /><br />91 year old Vivien and 16 year old Molly.  Both orphaned and thrashing about to find their places in the world...one in the past and the other in the present.  Their lives connect when Molly comes to Vivien's home to serve out 50 hours of community service she's earned by attempting to steal an old worn-out copy of Jane Eyre from the library.  Molly and Vivien spend those hours in Vivien's attic, sorting through boxes, stories, and memories.<br /><br />What I Liked<br /><br />The double narrative format - it's no secret at this point that I like this writing strategy...as long as it's done well.  Doing it well means that the author somehow manages to keep the reader's attention even as she flips from one timeframe to another.  I'm a little biased on the history section and wanted to read as much there as possible, but I was still drawn to the present, Molly and Vivian's relationship, as I was to Vivian's humble beginnings.  I also found it interesting that the author herself mentioned this in the interview at the back of the book.  Baker Kline strategically placed pieces of each timeframe within the other in order to do exactly what I described above...keep the reader involved in both stories by showing him/her the relevance of each piece.<br /><br />The Irish history and the Penobscot Indian history - Orphan Train is not steeped in history...the reader doesn't get bogged down or spend half her reading time googling (ahem, guilty pleasure), but there's enough here to whet the appetite of someone who is already interested in these areas, periods, and cultures.  The Native American cultures of the North Eastern U.S. is yet another part of U.S. history I somehow missed along the way.<br /><br />The Ending - I'm thankful for a story that doesn't end all wrapped up nice with a shiny bow on top...how many times does life really end that way after all.  What I do like is the theme threaded through every step of the story all the way to the very end...who we are is made up of a sometimes terrifying, uncontrollable chain of events.<br /><br />The story of Molly Mollases<br /><br />Vivien - the consummate survivor<br /><br />What I Didn't Like<br /><br />The foster home system of today and of course the non-existent foster home system of yesterday...<br /><br />Mrs. Byrne, Mr. and Mrs. Grote, Dina and who knows how many other people who taken in foster children  and then treated them poorly.<br /><br />Overall Recommendation<br /><br />If you like historical fiction that is a heart tugging narrative as well as a look back in time, you'll want to curl up with Orphan Train on a un-hurried weekend.we are is made up of a sometimes terrifying, uncontrollable chain of events.<br /><br />The story of Molly Mollases<br /><br />Vivien - the consummate survivor<br /><br />What I Didn't Like<br /><br />The foster home system of today and of course the non-existent foster home system of yesterday...<br /><br />Mrs. Byrne, Mr. and Mrs. Grote, Dina and who knows how many other people who taken in foster children  and then treated them poorly.<br /><br />Overall Recommendation<br /><br />If you like historical fiction that is a heart tugging narrative as well as a look back in time, you'll want to curl up with Orphan Train on a un-hurried weekend.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is a very good game and I would recommend this to a turtle and everyone I meet and I love it the worst feature is the lack of high quality graphics and dinosaurs
B009NY43NY|5.0|I really enjoyed this last book in the Sookie Stackhouse series.  Although, I wish there were more to come, I will really miss this series.  Who could be unhappy.  All the bad guys got it in the end and Sookie and Sam finally get together.  There is enough left intact that should the author wish to revisit these characters she could do more books.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Very good format and relevant to everyone daily living. Tina was very forthcoming and creative regarding her daily interactions with work, family and friends.
193700788X|1.0|What happened to our beloved Sookie, at what point did she turn into this weak pathetic character. Dissappointed that Sookie didnt end up with Eric of course, why build it up then tear it down, it's a romance novel the girl is supposed to get the great love. I never thought Harris was that great of a story teller to begin with but I did fall in love with these characters, so i stuck it out through all her errors and rambling plots. And then one day Sookie just wasn't there anymore but harris just kept on rambling.~DOA
B00COHAUD4|5.0|wasn't scary but was suspenseful! It had a rather sad ending and it was such a dark movie however it had a rather good plot line,
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun.if there's  a locks on something than that. just means you need to do something or you need to be on a higher level.in most games if there's a lock on it it means you neeb to buy it.so I give it 5stars.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Stephen King once talked about a book getting away from the author - it happens when a character takes on a life of his own and the author starts feeling compelled to bring the whole family and all his friends and acquaintances into the plot. And then for each of the new characters, he weaves stories about their family and friends too.  So you end up with a book about Our Hero - and the lives of his mother, father, six sisters, two brothers, all of his brothers and sisters-in-law, everybody's school friends, employers, teachers, cousins, nieces and nephews and the butcher, the baker and the candle stick maker.  The reader gets lost in a morass of plots and sub plots, dozens of characters and sometimes totally unrelated story lines that lead nowhere. This is what happened in this book. The first three books of the Throne series were very good, but the cast started to really get out of control in book four. A Dance with Dragons feels like Martin realized this and has tried to tie up all the loose ends - but only ends up muddying the waters even more. People keep dying and then not being dead anymore.  Some of the cast from the first two or three books have totally disappeared and nobody has a clue what has happened to them and the time lines are so confusing that you start reading a chapter and say to yourself &#34;but I thought he was hiding in a cave - how come he is safe in a castle?&#34; only to find out a few pages later that the story has now gone back before the person had left the castle to find the cave.  The writing is fine.  The story line is a mess.

0062124293|3.0|Moran can be entertaining, but for me didn't offer enough substance. Mixed in with some memoir, she shares her opinions on things like: the word c*nt, pubic hair, women in music, motherhood, abortion. This is fine but her shock-jock style of writing got annoying by the end. I felt like I was indulging mostly in her personality on these topics, and that's about it. I do think the book is better than nothing. Hopefully it leads readers to explore Faludi or even Sandberg's latest \\"Lean In\\" which offer data and real conclusions about how women can behave differently to make more opportunities for themselves. The title of the book seems grandiose to me. Feminism has room for all kinds of voices, so hey, at least its another voice out there..

B003K16P50|3.0|I'm glad the book was written, so it would inspire a movie.  The ending of the book was a downer as opposed to the much happier ending of the movie.  Although the book was cleverly written and some of it was very funny, I'm not sure I would have even finished reading it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I found the characters real and very easy to relate to.  The author did a terrific job of of not being artificial.  The movie didn't do this book justice at all.

Although we all admire President Lincoln the inside story on his innate abilities, his compassion and understanding of the American people makes this book a must read for everyone.  Ms Gooddwin brings the most trying time in American history to life and gives the reader an understanding that cannot be gotten from the standard fare.

B00985E3UG|4.0|Mr Moss has taken on a difficult task in trying to educate the American consumer on how the food industry is slowly but surely impacting our health.  Spending 40 years in the food industry and working with some of the principals in the text I can assure the reader that there is considerable truth to what Mr Moss reports on.  Altho Mr Moss does an excellent job on reporting the food industries role he fails to emphasize how the government is implicated as a willing partner in this.  The scientific community is also a player and should be brought into the fray.  Michael Pollan's well written book &#34;In Defense of Food - An Eaters Manifesto&#34; is a companion book and should be read either before or after Mr Moss'.  Mr Moss gives an excellent report on what the food industry does but does not provide the consumer on how to adjust their life styles to avoid this trap.  Something accomplished by Mr Pollan. Regardless read them both.

B00BKBCF38|4.0|I'm liking the this album a lot at the moment Only song I absolutely hate is \\"Body and Blood.\\" It sounds like christian rock to such an extreme and the chorus is so insistent it's hard to concentrate on them actually mocking Christianity. I get it thematically but the song still came out really bad and doesn't get it's point across. But it's just one song, easy to skip. My real problem with the album and what is making me lean towards a 3 rather than a 4 is the mastering. This album is compressed to death and clips constantly with no dynamic range in volume whatsoever. Even with a lighter band like Ghost this can lead to ear fatigue before the album is done. Listen to songs from the debut and this back to back and it's really easy to tell how poorly mastered this is. Loudness wars nonsense, but I still like the actual writing/performances of the songs quite a bit. On a total side note: what is up with seemingly NO ONE calling B.S. on the bands album covers. Maybe because they are a pop-rock-progressive band many of their fans are not into Black Metal, but the cover of Opus Eponymous looks exactly as if Papa Emeritus is standing on the cover of Mayhem's \\"De Mysteriis Dom Satanas\\" behind the church with some Scooby-Doo bats flying about. I figured that was perhaps an homage but now with the release of Infestissumam they have once again ripped off a famous image, but this time not from the world of Black Metal. Search for the 1984 movie Amadeus. Look at the movie poster. Look at this album cover. This is a direct rip-off. It has no bearing on the music but it just bothers me still how little thought was put into the artwork and packaging: and ahhhhh what packaging- he said sarcastically. Make sure you get the Deluxe Edition or you'll just end up with a thin cardboard sleeve with the cover of Amadeus on it. Really cheap and lazy. Anyone buying physical media in 2013 is usually looking for some nice packaging/cover art, so why make this cardboard edition at all. Downloadit if you don't want to pay extra for the deluxe edition. Anyhow, still digging the songwriting and would like to see them live very much.

B001OKGV6W|5.0|I love this film because it illustrates the subtle concept of meditation, multi-dimensions and the fact that time is an illusion. I've meditated and experienced not exact, but similar visuals that appear in the movie. I saw this film years ago when it first came out; prior to evolving to meditation and to watch it again all these years later I was surprised and was like \\"damn, that's just like when I meditate\\". During meditation the 3rd eye visual of moving through space is very much like a light show as it was in the movie. All my meditation sessions are not like that though, sometimes I'm just in the void and a visual pops up around me. Jodie Foster was the perfect person for the lead character i just love the passion of Dr. Arroway :)
B000GCFG7E|3.0|I am reading my way through the Jack reacher series and didn't find that this particular &#34;installment&#34; had the pace of earlier efforts. It was enjoyable, just not as quick and enjoyable a read as previous books in the series.

B007MDB548|5.0|We have all 4 Tinker bell movies and my girls LOVE them! This one is about sisters so if you have 2 (or more) daughters get it get it get it! The thing I like about Tinker bell movies is that most Disney movies will usually have at least one or more (adult) scary moments (WALLE, CARS and Toy Story 2 and a couple of others maybe the exceptions), but movies like finding nemo, Monsters inc, Alladdin, Lion King etc...although being amazing films and classic films I find I am always being asked to fast forward through certain sections of these movies by my kids. Tinker Bell movies do not have any of these adult scary moments, so because my girls are 2 and 4 these movies work great and can leave them to watch without worrying about them being scared about something they might see. I do believe as parents we have a responsibility to not expose certain things to our kids when they are too young.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|And this is a great underdog movie!!  You can't help but root for this team to win.  It is very formulistic - there are really few surprises in how this works out.  There is some foul language and immoral behaviors that I think the movie would have been better without, but it's a nice story for whiling away a few hours without heavy thinking :-)
159562015X|3.0|Really all you get with this book is the code to take the online test, I ordered hard cover copy but I should have just got the kindle as was cheaper, or if you can do not buy book just buy a code to do the test, not worth buying the physical book just to get the code for the test.<br /><br />The book has a couple of intro chapters and then tells you to use the code to do the test! The rest of the book is just a repeat of what you get shown after you do the test, there are 34 characteristics, you get 4 after finishing test, all book does is show you all 34 of these characteristics, which of course only 4 are really relevant to you anyway.<br /><br />I am pretty disappointed about this book, I wish they had stated this upfront, to me it's a completed waste having the book, it's only value is the code. The test itself is ok, takes about 30 minutes, cannot say I have really learned anything new that i did not already know, I enjoyed the flag test much more, was $15 online, no book and just was a whole lot better.

B000OVLINI|5.0|This book is now part of my all-time favorite book collection. I read the kindle version, but enjoyed it so much I am going to look for a print copy for my shelves. The story itself was complex and intriguing. The description of the times made me feel as if I were there. I really climbed into the story. It so drew me in. If you enjoy books and mysteries and mysteries about books, you must read this. Now, excuse me, as I am off to download the entire series!
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Love this album! They tame it down a little more than usual but keep to their unique sound. You won't be disappointed!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is amazing.  Excellent controls combined with engaging and humorous gameplay make for one of th  best experiences I've ever had with my kindle.  Also, odd as this sounds, it is an amazing stress reliever.
B004JHY80I|2.0|I enjoyed part 1 especially the twist at the end but from there on the plot became totally absurd and complex. The depiction of London at the time, the poverty the deprivation the attitudes towards women, all of that is interesting but the story line goes from bad to worse and in the end I honestly didn't care how it ended.

B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Well this was surprising. I've never been a huge Tom Cruise fan, but judging from the trailers Jack Reacher looked like it was a solid action flick and, for the most part, it was. Unfortunately, it loses some of its steam in the last 30-40 minutes when it transforms from a unique thriller to a cliched action film.<br /><br />Jack Reacher starts off with a sniper (Jai Courtney) taking out what appears to be five random people. When police arrive on the scene all evidence points to a man by the name of James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former U.S. Army sniper. When given the option to confess or go to trial his only response was \\"Get Jack Reacher\\". While being transported to a new facility, Barr is beaten into a coma by his fellow inmates and that's where Reacher comes in. Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is a former officer for the U.S. Military Police Corpse. He's also a drifter which makes it extremely hard to find him.<br /><br />When he arrives at the hospital where Barr is being kept it's no surprise that District Attorney Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins) and Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) are more than a little surprised. While at the hospital he also meets Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), who is serving as Barr's defense attorney. When asked how he knew his friend had asked for him, Reacher says that Barr isn't his friend and that he had come to kill him. The rest of the movie deals with Reacher and Helen putting together the pieces of a very complicated puzzle as we find out that Barr was not only set-up, but that the shooter had a secret motive.<br /><br />From the start Jack Reacher is extremely engaging. In fact, about half way through the movie the disc I was watching this on started skipping and I don't think I've worked faster in my life trying to get a movie to work again. Luckily I did, but maybe it was a sign that I should've called it quits because about 15-20 minutes later the story started getting out of control. They took every action cliche in the book and applied it to the end of this movie. Now this was never an intellectual film, but it had enough flare that made it stand out from the crowd. It offered some fresh ideas to some old formulas which made it worthwhile, but that somehow got lost during the film's final half-hour.<br /><br />That's not to say that Jack Reacher became unwatchable, but the fact that we had Reacher rescuing the damsel in distress (Helen) just felt really out of place. Reacher never showed any signs of intimacy towards the woman, so what was the point? There was no romance at all in the first hour and half, but he somehow cares so much for this woman that he's willing to risk his life for her? It just didn't add up and it felt like it was put there just because we've seen it done in almost every other action film ever created. To top it off the film allowed little-to-no closure about who these men were. We learn about a possible motive for the shooting, but it's obvious these people don't work for the company that hired them. So where did they come from?<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, did a good job and I don't really have many complaints in this department. Tom Cruise gave another Tom Cruise performance. We've seen him play this badass action hero before so don't expect to be blown away by something new. Rosamund Pike and Richard Jenkins both gave solid performances. Nothing to write home about, but nothing that brings down the film either. The only one who felt a little flat was Diavid Oyelowo. In the beginning he was fine, but as the film progressed and we learned more about his character his performance kind of fell apart. That's another thing, they didn't go into detail about why his character did what he did. All he said was \\"You act like I had a choice\\". Okay, well what did they do to you exactly? There's just a lot of things the audience never finds out.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7.75/10 - I know this looks like a highscore compared to the amount of complaining I did, but that shows just how strong the first 80% of this film is. If it would have been more consistent it probably would've gotten a nine, but, as you can see, that didn't happen. They had some cool ideas, and Reacher is a pretty interesting character, but the end of the film is very underwhelming and they leave a lot of unanswered questions. If you're a fan of Tom Cruise then chances are you've already seen this. For those who haven't, if you don't mind some cliche in your action films then you should at least give it a rental. Because even though the ending is a little generic, the rest of the movie is more than worth it.

B00AYM6JFO|5.0|This is a breezy album of love songs with a swing sound, inspired particularly by Django Reinhardt (and including one of Reinhardt's compositions). The spare, but lively arrangements give Nelson a chance to caress each song with his beautiful guitar solos. Start to finish, it is a pleasure to listen to as the summer comes on.

B00A83075M|5.0|Whenever my grandsons visit they beg to watch this movie.  It is action packed without being &#34;scary&#34;, and funny enough for the grownups to enjoy.  Watching my boys dancing to the closing credit music is always my favorite part!
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This is one of the best free workout apps I have seen. The exercises change so you don't get stuck in a rut and they are grouped so you can target specific areas or choose a total body workout. One can also choose the duration of the workout so endurance can be built slowly. I have this app on both my phone and my Kindle Fire so workouts can go with me everywhere.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|i dont have read the books but i do know reacher is a big guy wich is weird seen tom cruise in the role but since hes one of the producers i guess the author sold out on this one
B0085W09ME|3.0|While this app is useful for tracking flights for trips you may want to watch it doesn't always return the best prices for the trips. Case in point: I recently was watching flights from Pittsburgh to Nashville and the price returned on the app was $35 higher than what the airline I chose was offering on their website. I do like that you can track multiple trips in one place rather than visiting multiple booking websites but they need to work on the pricing piece a bit more. Would recommend for someone wanting to watch several trips at once and then just use the airlines' websites to confirm final pricing.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Finally a book that gives the other side of a murder.  This family suffers so much when their son is accused of murder.  They want to believe he did not do it, but doubts sometimes creep in.  They are virtually ostracized by their neighbors and most of their friends, and running into the parents of the murdered boy is a nightmare that makes the reader cringe with sadness for all.  The end is not anticipated and while heartbreaking, the reader comes away with the feeling that it ended as well as it could for this doomed family.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Love the options and digital tape readout. Glad I stumbled across this app during a freebie run in the app store. Well worth the money it would have cost.

B00138JAI6|5.0|I consider myself a music fan, and as I've explored jazz I've tried to learn about &#34;the great albums&#34;. I came across a couple lists that put this as #3 (after &#34;Kind of Blue&#34; and &#34;A Love Supreme&#34;, which are pretty hard to argue with). After one listen, I felt ashamed not to have bought this YEARS ago. Every tune is superb. There's a lot of variety in style. The playing is perfect. The ideas are startling.<br /><br />I wish I was a good enough jazz aficionado to describe how great this album is. It is GREAT.

B003P2WO5E|1.0|I've read a lot of great things about this book and really wanted to like it, but frankly it did not hold my interest. Most books I consume in a couple of days but I've been working on this for months... the characters just are not that interesting to me.
B001AIY58O|5.0|Not for young kids (violence and profanity) but great for action film lovers (lot's of humor). I just can't understand how an actor can do most of these scenes without laughing their &#34;A&#34; off!

B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was a great conclusion to the other two Batman movies. The story was great and the action intense. I thought that Anne Hathaway did a great job portraying Catwoman. Also Christian's voice was clearer and not as angry as that of the Joker interrogation scene in The Dark Knight.  Overall this was great entertainment. I am a little sad that they didn't continue.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|One reviewer complained that Daniel Craig looked too old.  He looks old on purpose; aging is one of this film's themes. The film proposes two questions:  Is 007 too old for field work?  And on a meta-level, are the James Bond series and character too old, and should they be retired? I applaud the screenwriter and filmmaker for adding a bit of thoughtfulness into a series whose entries, one after the other, are essentially retreads of each other. I think many Bond fans dislike this film because it is a bit literary and because it looks a little into the inner life of Bond to create a character who is a bit more than a one dimensional playboy spy.  There's nothing wrong with stretching your brain a bit in between scenes of gunplay and explosions.<br /><br />The Bond filmmakers have decided to retreat to the past, hence the new male M and the reincarnation of Miss Moneypenny.  They also brought the old gimmick riddled Astin Martin out of storage.  But they blew it up.  No, they didn't just blow it up, they blew it up real good.  So are the filmmakers going to turn Daniel Craig into Sean Connery after all?  I doubt it. The annihilation of Skyfall indicates that they have chosen to destroy the past;  it was a dreary old house, wasn't it?<br /><br /> Of course, early in the film, Bond is  declared dead and his possessions sold.  As Bond later says, his hobby is resurrection.  So, since he died and was reborn, what now? Maybe the answer lies in Bond's weaponry.  Ultimately, Bond killed the cyber terrorist with the simplest of weapons, the hunting knife that belonged to the game keeper of the old Bond estate.(Bond lost the fancy pistol Q gave him early on.)  Computers can wreak havoc, but they must be programmed and operated by people.  It's up to people like Bond to kill the bad people.<br /><br /> And that's what will keep on happening, Bond killing the bad guys.  So, what will change?  As the female M said in a previous film, Bond is a blunt instrument.  One can't do much with a blunt instrument.  Where to now?

Perfect for any LoZ fan.

B00992CF6W|5.0|My 6 year old is addicted to this game and so am I! Such a fun game and at a decent price
1433502410|5.0|I ordered this for my son.It is a very big book.I would highly recommend this to all!And it came on time.And was packed perfect! I highly recommend this seller.If we need to order anymore book's I would use this seller.<br /><br />Thankyou so much.....LBritt
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|This game is so much fun and truly addictive! Punching monsters in their faces has never been so much fun!
0810983915|5.0|Purchased this book for my 8 year old and he couldn't put it down until he finished it... Made me proud to witness his getting into reading more..
B008K9UZY4|5.0|Truly identical to the original! It is a blast to replay a classic game from my childhood. My daughter loves this game so much! Decent price too!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Good 'ole PJ has done it again!<br />After following all the video-blogs, it's hard to believe that The Hobbit is actually here. I am impressed with what he has done to bring the first part of this Hobbit trilogy to the big screen. The story line is fairly easy to follow and is similar in format to the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. From beginning to end, the movie holds your attention and sets up the next two films perfectly. Of course, there are a few things I would change but I believe every true Tolkien fan will find something that they don't agree with. Overall, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is worth your money and will certainly leave you anxiously awaiting The Desolation of Smaug!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I am 35 and really enjoying this app.  Fun ..cute..and challenging.  My 5 year old likes it too but given she is younger she has a different approach than I do<br /><br />I love this game but I have not been able to access my reef for a few weeks now.  It just won't connect and my friends can't connect to it either.  Where do I go for help on this?
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Well, it took pretty much a decade to get through the series, but it was completely worth it!  A memory of light is the perfect ending to an excellent series.  I look forward to reading more if sanderson's work now that he has finished jordon's masterpiece.
B004TI1WME|4.0|This is a nice calculator which has the benefit of having the history of totals you're adding up just like a paper reel. It does a lot more as well, but that feature alone is worth having in your app bag.
0199267170|5.0|Great price, fast service, the world standard on the subject. I am really pleased with the high quality paper and binding on everyone's favorite author.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|i am additive to this game. i have gone home to play the game instead of going to the gym after work sometimes.  i like playing it.
B00030DEQE|3.0|The card is pretty good, but watch out if installing on ESXi 5.1. For some reason it auto negotiates to 100Mb instead of 1000Mb. Also, if you manually set it 1000Mb the card loses connectivity. Luckily this was just a lab, but if you're looking for a cheap gigabit card for ESXi you may want to buy another model.
B005LAIHGI|3.0|OK, this man is crazy... and he is without boundaries!  He'll say or do anything and isn't afraid of any subject matter!  I watched about 1/2 of Borat.... just couldn't watch the rest... not my cup of tea, but this movie....  although it was crude... not as bad as Borat... and I don't really like crude... still made me laugh.  SBC is insane!  I think you should watch it!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Loved the casting, the direction, the story, the effects! Enough homage paid to the original series and crew and yet also new and fun.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Enjoyed the story and its delivery.  Would've liked to follow more stories about Ender as the commander so I was disappointed about how quickly Orson Scott Card wrapped up the story in the end.
0345803485|5.0|I honestly do not know how I feel about this book. On one hand, some of it appalled me but on the other hand I was thoroughly intrigued. I could not and would not put this book down. At one moment I loved Christian and the next I wanted to kill him. The book messed with my mind. I would go from rooting for Christian and Ana to work things out to telling Ana to run for the hills in the blink of an eye. It is clear that Christian has a lot of issues that need to be worked out.<br /><br />This book caused a war between my head and my heart. My head said DANGER STAY AWAY, while my heart saw a tormented man in serious need of help. I had trouble reconciling these feelings. Then I noticed that this was Ana's problem as well. She wants to save Christian but knows that it is a dangerous situation. This really allows to reader to empathize with Ana. I did not judge Ana as much as I thought I was going to. I honestly thought I was going to find her insipid and easily manipulated and hate her for even considering a relationship like this. However I couldn't bring myself to do this because I could see the war that was going on between her head and her heart.<br /><br />One thing I did enjoy about the book was the email conversations between Christian and Ana. The banter was great and I especially enjoyed the subject titles. These were the moments where I could see the better side of Christian, the moments where I was rooting for them to make things work.<br /><br />One complaint I have is that they sounded a little British at times for people living in Seattle, but this makes sense being as the author is British. It wasn't prominent enough to really bother me, but every now and them I would think \\"hmm that sounds odd.\\"<br /><br />Overall I would recommend you give this book a shot. When reflecting on the book later, I came to the decision that I did really like this book. Whether you like the book or not it will definitely intrigue you and give you a very different type of read.
055338466X|2.0|I was given this book to read by a friend with no real math/physics background who had really enjoyed it. I'm afraid I can't second that experience. It started on page 1 when the authors declared that philosophy used to answer question about the natural world but philosophy is now dead. That makes them sound like two authors who know nothing about philosophy. Scientists could probably use a background in philosophy more than most, to prevent them from unleashing their hubris on the world with the arrogance shown here. The two authors might start with Spinoza's On The Improvement Of The Understanding to get a perspective on the distortions brought about in the human personality by fame and riches. Also, at one time the nomenclature used by writers like Newton was &#34;Natural Philosophy&#34;. This philosophy is far from dead, simply renamed science at a much later date.<br />  On the second page I read that Feynman played bongos in a strip club. He did play bongos to be sure, I have a friend who was at Cal Tech at the time and constantly irritated bynFeynman playing them out on the lawn. But every account of him at the strip club that I have seen had him working on physics, I've never heard or read of him playing them elsewhere than in parties, on the lawn, etc so this description just looks to be punched up for color. . And since M theory wasn't around pervious to his passing its misleading to pretend that he would agree with it or that it rests on his ideas. He was more skeptical and less inclined to scientific fashion than either of these authors.<br />  So this is a very basic retelling  of the current fashion in grand theories, simply written for people with no mathematical background, and written in the current popular mode. I like some of Mlodinow's other books but he should be happy Hawking got top billing on this one. Hawking is no more of an expert on ultimate truth than any of the rest of us and his scientific depth is not matched in any other area. Read with caution.
0345803493|5.0|The follow up to Fifty Shades of Grey did not disappoint. The further I got into this book, the more I realized how much I really really LOVE this series. There is just something incredibly intriguing about these books.<br /><br />I love that the characters in this book are flawed, especially Christian. They do not have a candy coated relationship and truly have to work very hard at it. To me, it makes what they feel for each other seem that much stronger. Both are willing to make sacrifices for the other, as long as it means making their relationship work.<br /><br />Christian makes a remarkable amount of progress in this book. At times I found myself thinking \\"is this really the same Christian\\" and then he would do something incredibly stupid and overprotective and I would go \\"o yes, same Christian.\\" However, it is very clear that he is trying. I have genuinely come to like Christian's character, despite his flaws. Maybe it is his flaws that make me like him. You can't help feeling for him and desperately wanting to fix him. Also, this book shows his \\"hearts and flowers\\" side.<br /><br />Ana also shows progress. She is no longer overly intimidated by Christian and is much more willing to stand up to him. She begins to realize how much power she has over him and that he really does need her. She knows when to challenge him and when she is pushing him too far. It is clear that Ana leaving was the best thing for their relationship.<br /><br />Once again one of my favorite parts of the book were the emails between Christian and Ana. The banter in the emails is hysterical and I always got excited when I saw the emails pop up on the page.<br /><br />The ending to Fifty Shades Darker will leave you dying for the next one, in desperate need of more Ana and Christian. This book gets under your skin and will possess you from beginning to end.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I wish review people would stop making it mandatory for us to write something, maybe we just want to give it a good star rating and go about our day. Crazily enough some of us may be too busy to fill out some long review about an app for our phone or tablet. That's not to say its not a good app but I'm just saying requiring us to type something seems like a dick move, maybe you'll consider changing it or maybe I'm just blowing smoke but more often then not I opt to not do reviews because I don't feel I should be required to type anything. Thanks for the app.
0345803507|5.0|This series has been an exhilarating experience. I started Fifty Shades of Grey and wasn't sure how I felt about the book, by the end of Fifty Shades Freed I knew I was in love and I know that these books have made my re-read list. What can I say about Fifty Shades Freed? It is exciting, exhilarating, sexy, sweet, intriguing, and down right amazing. Simply put it is fifty shades of feelings.<br /><br />While Christian is still infuriating at times, it is still impossible to hate him (although I did come very close at one point). He has truly come a long way. If one were to compare the Christian in Fifty Shades of Grey to the Christian in Fifty Shades Freed, you would swear they weren't the same character. Christian has basically grown up (for the most part anyway). While he has come a long way, he is far from cured. He of course has his typical \\"control-freak-fifty shades-Christian\\" moments, but once again the effort he is making in monumental.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning of the book and the style in which it was written. By including flashbacks, it enabled the story to move along quickly, while still letting the reader see some very important events. Another thing, and I said it in the review for Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker, but I still love the email conversations. I could not get enough of them.<br /><br />This series was truly a great ride, one I would like to enjoy again and again. I stayed up late into the night reading this book and woke up with what I like to refer to as a \\"good book hangover.\\" I felt like a hole had been punched through my chest and I was upset to have finished the series. Simply put, I wanted more- I still want more. The Fifty Shades Series was like nothing I have ever read before, and I doubt I will ever read anything like it again. This series is truly fifty shades of awesome.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie since I first caught it in the cinema and when the opportunity arose to pick up this set at a reasonable price, it was a no brainer for me. The movie is a terrific showcase for those who have big screen HD TV setups and looks pretty great in 3D.
0545259096|3.0|I picked up Shiver and I was not a really big fan, but curiosity won out so I decided to read Linger. Linger was a little bit better, but it still wasn't one of my favorites. Then I picked up Forever, and I thoroughly enjoyed everything about the book. I loved the characters and the action and the romance, and then I reached the end of the book, and it thoroughly let me down.<br /><br />Personally, I felt that the ending lacked the necessary closure for the end of a series. I read the last page and honestly did not realize that it was the end. I went to turn the page to start the next chapter and then I was staring at the author acknowledgements. I restarted my nook to make sure it wasn't glitching and I was missing something, but no that really was the end and I felt unsatisfied to say the least. I just thought too much was left open since we do not really find out what exactly is going to happen to the characters. When a series concludes, I want more than just implications and assumptions, I want a definite conclusion. The ending we are left with could go numerous different ways.<br /><br />While I was disappointed with the ending, I really did enjoy everything that lead up to it. The pacing in Forever was much better than the previous books as was the action. I just felt like so much more happened in this book. The plot had more depth and the story had more to it than just romance. While the romance definitely took a back seat in this novel, it was just as sweet as ever. The depth of Sam and Grace's relationship is still present, but it is not thrown in your face constantly.<br /><br />Cole St. Claire is the best thing that ever happened to these novels. His personality is refreshing, and despite his issues he came across as the strongest character in this novel. While Sam was drawing into himself because Grace was gone, Cole was the one to keep his head on his shoulders and deal with the problems at hand. He shows drastic character growth throughout this novel and really develops into the person you knew he could be when you first met him. Reading from his perspective was by far my favorite and I would have been content to read the whole book from his point of view.<br /><br />All in all, Forever was a great read outside of the ending. People who enjoyed the first two novels are sure to enjoy this one as well. Would I recommend this series, probably not, but I can understand the appeal it holds for some. However, if you have started the series it is definitely worth finishing because it does get better. I just wish the ending was more conclusive.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Now that it is finally out of Panasonic's exclusivity period, I had to pick this one up. Looks and sounds phenomenal on my home theater setup. However, this set is missing the Director's Cut version of the movie.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Enjoyed the plot more than original movie. Nothing too deep, just good entertainment. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good action movie.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|This was fun to watch.  I would recommend this video.  I also love being a Prime member - plenty of free videos,  books and apps.
B000089QEN|5.0|I like this production of Vanity Fair above all others I've seen. The cast, costuming and sets are what I give 5 stars for. The casting was spot-on, each actor delivering excellent character interpretations, even when not absolutely as described in the book. But then, screenplay adaptations - even from the talented Andrew Davies - are rarely in perfect alignment with the book. All of the actors were believable and all did excellent work.<br /><br />Natasha Little's portrayal of Becky was wonderfully done, showing her as maliciously manipulative, a consummately deceptive liar, overall, a thoroughly nasty little piece of work. Becky is perceptive and very clever, always aware of those around her and consistently on the make for her own gain. Sometimes, she simply plays with the emotions of others, as a game, then she steps back to watch and enjoy the trouble she has caused.<br /><br />Also of special note is the excellent David Bradley, playing the rascally and disgusting Sir Pitt Crawley to perfection. In his scene as a dying man... the way he kissed Lady Jane, played by Sylvestra Le Touzel, was (no other words for it) icky and cringeworthy.<br /><br />My criticisms are in regard to the heavy-handed music, the overlay of pompous brass was far too repetitive and distracting. Very little would have gone a long way. My second and heaviest criticism is in regard to the camera work. A great many of the shots were done so close that only part of a face is shown, filling the screen. When the camera is that close and moving, the pictures are a blur, leaving the shot and scene somewhat undefined instead of actual. There is no clear view of what is going on around these close, often blurred images. I don't understand why anyone would want to film this way. Given these distractions, this is still the only Vanity Fair film production I own and want to watch, again and again.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I'm learning a lot more about the control of many businesses in the U. S since I watched this documentary.  Too many citizens are being blinded by our fast paced lifestyle and our insatiable &#34;need&#34; to consume.  It is crucial that Americans slow down and take back the power we have given to a handful of multi-billion dollar corporations.  Each individual can make a difference.  Together we can send a message that we don't want to eat ammoniated filler in cheap hamburgers or chickens that never see the light of day and are grown in overcrowded fecies filled buildings which includes e-coli and other health hazards.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love it! This has to be the best book I've ever read! Liked it even more than fifty shades of grey series!
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|The movie was great - AFTER I ORDERED IT ON GOOGLE PLAY. Amazon Instant Video never played it after numerous attempts
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book was not only an education in flowers but a strongly powerful education in our system of child welfare.  Both a love story and a political statement as to our treatment of children left to linger in a system that awards foster parents to take advantage of those children that are left to suffer through life not knowing or recognizing the meaning of love.
B000MD9UJC|1.0|I tried in two different maglights, and even swapped parts around to see if I could make at least one work. Spent I bet 3 hours working on them. Finally decided that for the time alone i invested in these, i could have bought a new LED maglight.  Can't recommend.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is definitely NOT for the faint of heart. I couldn't stop reading ... the 1st, 2nd, 3rd ... and I am eagerly awaiting the 4th! Bring it on.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Patrick is the true person. He is honest and interesting and hilarious. Through pat we understand true love, what it really means and how it may be recovered or discovered.
B006M4F67A|3.0|Every time I am in the middle of playing the game, it stops running?  I don't understand.<br />I have lost my progress and have to start over again.<br />Not too impressed.
B00B7G3NFU|2.0|Very little according to the sex surrogate Cheryl played by Helen Hunt.  The difference, &#34;I don't want your return business.&#34; This odd film implies that the Catholic Church represented by a hip priest has no problem with Cheryl's type of legal prostitution. The voyeuristic priest takes all of 30 seconds to give the protagonist, Mark, assurance that Jesus will give him a pass for becoming a john. The priest never once mentions that the time to get a therapist (not surrogate) is when you are in a committed monogamous relationship (ideally marriage) and you have issues you cannot resolve as a couple. But why not? Even Cheryl's husband calls her a &#34;saint&#34; for having sex with other men, although he draws a firm line at her receiving poems from them. The only real sin in the movie is when Cheryl begins to have feelings for Mark--evidently a no-no for women in her profession. If the film had examined this theme, it might have stumbled upon redemption, i.e. that the sexual act always effects the body, soul and mind and there are consequences to so-called &#34;casual&#34; sex of any kind, &#34;licensed&#34; or not.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I play the **** out of this cd.  I really love the song with Leon Russell, really makes me feel New Orleans.<br />Great album.
0525478817|2.0|As a book for adults to read I would give \\"The Fault in our Stars\\" 1 star. As a book for teenagers I would give it 3. Thus the 2 star rating I gave it for the purposes of this review. I have seen first-hand how teenagers eat this book up and I find their reaction appropriate to their intellectual and maturity levels. What I don't get are all the adults fawning over this text. My review is aimed at those readers.<br />As someone who works every day with teenagers I could not get over the massively unrealistic speech / dialogue of the kids that this novel portrays. The brightest kids I know don't talk the way these characters do, and in this book ALL the kids talk like Aaron Sorkin writes their dialogue. As a result I kept being pulled out of the story by this distraction. Coming from the mouths of kids it is just obnoxious.<br />The most ridiculous aspect of this book is the subplot that involves the protagonist's favorite writer, Peter Van Houten. It horribly detracts from the main plot of the text, and needed to be cut from the novel entirely. To make matters worse, some of the worst written parts of this novel deal with that subplot. Some examples include an insipid and unrealistic trip to Amsterdam that is just for lack of a better word, stupid. It involves a scene where the protagonist and her boyfriend kiss in the Anne Frank museum and onlookers clap while they kiss. No joke! It feels like a parody of bad writing. It is not helped by the fact that the character of Peter Van Houten has the most pretentious and fake sounding speech that I have come across in a book. His character wrote a novel that is the favorite of the protagonists' called \\"An Imperial Affliction\\" and the characters in this text quote from, and reference, it often. If the book actually existed it would be one of the more pretentious and unreadable things on the planet.<br />Now as to why I think teenagers love this book. First, it is a very quick read. You do keep turning the pages. The topic of the text (teenagers with cancer) is an engaging idea full of dramatic possibilities. The last 80 pages or so of the book have some decent moments. Alas, they are too often followed by scenes of such sap that they quickly descend into clich&eacute; and the worse kind of sentimentality.<br />As I said earlier, the novel's topic is a good one, and I am disappointed that Mr. Green insisted on making what could have been an interesting story into the worst kind of melodrama.f the text (teenagers with cancer) is an engaging idea full of dramatic possibilities.

B009K0P10K|5.0|A friend kept talking about Revenge.  I had not watched it because of a conflict.  Then I decided to see what I was missing,  OMG!  I watched the entire 2 seasons of Revenge on my Kindle Fire, 44 episodes in about 2 weeks!  I could not stop watching it.  Now I have to wait for the fall when Season 3 begins.  I absolutely loved it and loved watching it on my Kindle Fire.  Thank you Amazon for making it so easy.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book was a glimpse into the hidden horrors of the generational prison camps of North Korea, the nearly impossible escape from #14 and the new world waiting outside.  It opened my eyes into the hidden secrets of a nation enveloped in fear.  A great book.  Short and well written.  Highly recommended.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|It's a great game to play you can do multiple things at one time.I love this game I play it every day
B0067LY4WG|3.0|Probably abit reflective and I have to be in the mood to listen to this.  Enjoy it sometimes.  Leonard Cohen is great but abit sad!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Good book. Interesting characters. The relationship between characters and their growth as people was well done. The book captures your interest from beginning to end.
B00B2166BS|5.0|If you have Nexus 10 and you do not have this charger you are missing a real improvement. Even though, I thought Pogo was a comic strip or something, I bought the cable on the chance my Nexus 10 would charge in less time. I have found in a very unscientific test that this charger works as advertised. I leave to my serious tech friends to tell why. Why the bumps along one side are called, pogo, and not some sort of magnet is best explained by the better informed as well. What I do know is, one gets a very solid bond when the larger end of the cable comes into the magnetic field of the 'bumps/pogos.' I can go from 21% charge to100% charge in about 4hours charging. With the Google supplied charger it took over night. One needs the square plug in the issued charge assembly to juice up the cable. Pogophilac or not one can plug it in with ease and no certification in techdom is required.
B004G8P2M8|1.0|I started this book twice, but I could not go past the third chapter. It reads like someone re-telling the action of a very boring movie. It coud serve as a book of examples of mistakes to avoid in writing a detective story.
B00A81MV3U|3.0|I just wanted to echo what others have said.  I like romantic comedies but this is, at best, an average film.  There was nothing spectacular about the acting or writing.  It had no depth.  It seemed like the characters' flaws were showcased in some scenes but disappeared in others.  I wasn't drawn in at all and cared little what happened at the end.<br /><br />$4.99 was too much for a rental.  I won't watch again.
B001O2QW9G|5.0|Very realistic and durable. My daughter needed for some photos. It worked perfectly and captured well. Now it's a nice virtual pet for her!
0785163174|5.0|This book is a must have for either fellow readers of the historic Avengers & X-Men titles. I however would recommend purchasing the new tie-in graphic novel. Or some backstory reading if new or recently getting caught up with the ever evolving Marvel Universe. Peace and good readings 1!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have not completed the book, but it has captured my interest. I can't wait to get home to read it. I like the mix of historical information and fiction
B004HD61KE|4.0|As usual,JR has melded elements of fact and theory again. My gauge is how late I'm willing to stay up to finish the book...this one was 3:45AM
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Well worth the small cost....easy to use and provides very useful information.  Best money I've spent for an app so far!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was a great option when our cable provided stopped carrying AMC. We love this show and could not do without!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Too detailed now.  I am not a meteorologist;  I just want to know the temperature and precipitation with satellite....the way it used to be.
B000BTJDGC|3.0|Not as scary as I thought it would be. I was told it was super scary, but they were wrong.
B000JO9JHW|2.0|A representation of an extremely perverted person. I find the concept of the series distasteful in the extreme. The idea of tracking down the bad guys vigilante style makes for a good basic plot that we can all empathize with, however Dexter as a person and his driving passions are beyond my comprehension and belong is the trash. If you are into exploring insanity, maybe this is for you, but personally, I find the character of Dexter to be abhorrent in the extreme and not something I care to explore further.
B0053XM7ZU|5.0|By the time you get to part two, of book three, you must know that you're an addict.<br /><br />On reading the series (on my kindle) I'd missed this book. So there was a massive story hole by the time I got to book four. So much so I was disappointed that GRR had moved this to back story.<br /><br />Not exactly the order I wanted to read the books in, but you can't undo reading a book, and I had to complete my knowledge. Given that, I LOVED this book. All of your favourite characters appear, and are plunged into even more impossible situations than ever before.<br /><br />As with all his work, you can't put it down. You have to work hard to keep in mind all of the relationships. And the thrill ride is deliciously explicit.<br /><br />The problem comes when you start seeing characters in your work colleagues, and asking yourself &#34;what would Tyrion do?&#34; :-)<br /><br />If you're a fan - get it. Read it before watching the TV series.<br /><br />If you're not a fan, hardly likely you'll be reading my review :-)
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I have watched this movie several times and you always pick up on things you missed before. A great story to pass on for a history lesson.
0061537969|5.0|This might be my favorite book, if you happen to catch me on the right day.<br /><br />A lot of people are turned off, thinking it's a book about racing.  It's not.  It's a book about a dog and his relationship with his owner, who just so happens to be an auto mechanic and part time racer.  The truths found in racing -- and as a racer, I can tell you they are truths -- turn out to be just as applicable in life and relationships as they do on the track.<br /><br />It's an incredibly touching story, one that has me in tears every time, even though I know how the book is going to end and you're even told in the beginning how the book is going to end.  Heck, I'm choking up just thinking about it now.  Any book that can move you to those kind of emotions, be it a book about dogs, about racing, or about anything really, is worth a place on your bookshelf.  This one, full of truths about how to live, is worth far more than that.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|Ditto to all the 4 and 5 star reviews on this movie. Not much else can be said. It was a good movie based on a real event that everyone was aware of. So, it was kind of a bitter sweet movie. Sad, but true.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|nice ending, but other than that. the movie was slow. and i don't understand why it got so many good reviews. it was predictable. slow. boring. if you want a good bradley cooper movie, stick with limitless or the hangover. at least they keep your attention. YAWN. a wasted $4.99 rental
B00APUQH0W|5.0|I'm not a baseball person, but the story line, and the way things tie up so perfectly at the end made this movie great!
B0031RS4UM|3.0|We get to meet more of the old Jack Reacher, his boss, and of course the situations are pretty dire.<br /><br />I couldn't get over the antagonist, and the contrived scenario. If someone is that smart, they'd have to understand the need for an economically viable state.<br /><br />Nevertheless, suspending your disbelief is the key to enjoying Jack Reacher.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|I love role playing games and I am now playing Skyrim on my PS3. Ravensword is a good portable for Skyrim type games when I'm away from my console. I've just started getting into the game and it plays well on my Kindle fire HD. The graphic are very good and the touch screen controls are very easy to get use to. I would recommend this game for any one who loves role playing games and want a portable substitute for games such as Skyrim.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|This is an excellent adaptation of one of Jane Austen's beautiful novels.  It is my personal favorite!  It is very true to the book and the actors are fantastic in their roles.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|love this app.  has some really great fuctionality.  definatly a must have if you like having different alarms for various things.
B004EPZ084|5.0|When your having a bad day at work, just relax and take a breath, it could be worst! So cheer up!
B008XX6J92|4.0|It's amazing (sorry for the overused word) that these songs didn't make into some of her past releases.  I Think It's Gonna Rain Today featuring Randy Newman on the piano is a standout.  I think &#34;If It's Meant To Be&#34; is the best cut and maybe one of her best ever!  The orchestration, the words and her perfect interpretation gives me chills.  She doesn't oversing it.  She does it just right.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|Very graphic writing. Also interesting is the anti-semitism that apparently was rife in pre-WII USA. My next book will be the one about bull fighting.
193700788X|1.0|Very, very disappointed.....the author did a disservice to her vested fans....I don't think I'll ever get this close to characters in a book series ever again...<br />Waited a year for such disappointment...Why would you have two main characters be so central through the whole series and then ..poof...have them end up like they did here....the writing seemed rushed and the characters didn't feel right...Ive read fan fiction much better than this book..
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love watching Ellen and wanted to learn a little bit more about her.  I didn't realize it was a book with non-stop &#34;stand up comedy lines&#34;.  After a bit, I got tired of it.  Just not for me I guess....
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really liked The Room! The puzzles were challenging, but not so much that I couldn't enjoy the game. The clues to help you along were just enough to send you in the right direction without revealing too much. My only complaint is that the game was not long enough!
B004EPZ07U|5.0|Christopher Nolan ( THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY ) and Zack Snyder ( 300 & THE MAN OF STEEL ) could make a movie showing the Downfall of Sinestro and how the Yellow Ring's power matches up with the Green Ring's power.
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|The standout is the duet with Dolly Parton on &#34;Do I Love You.&#34;  Also very interesting is the Sinatra duet on &#34;My Way.&#34;  Paul already did a version of it about 15 years, but it's been entirely redone for this new CD.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I love this CD! Lots of great songs that I can groove to & she really does make an impression whether you are watching or listening to her.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Criminal Minds is my absolute favorite series. I would never be disappointed. As long as they keep my favorite stars....that would be all of them!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Wish I had been able to read this 20 years ago when starting my career.  Full of smart, practical advice.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Peter Jackson has done another amazing film to the world of the Lord of the Rings. Hope after the last GAME OF THRONES season book gets filmed, HBO may hire Peter Jackson to make a Prequel film on the Beginning story of Westeros, how the Great Houses came to be, and how the Sigil of each House was marked by Creatures like Dragons, Direwolves, Kraken and others look when these roamed the ancient land.
B003AKLFAG|3.0|Definitely worth seeing as an example of Korean film making, but the sensational plot felt forced. The twist at the end was over-the-top. Unfortunately, this is typical of most Asian films. I give this a 7/10.
B004E3X9HK|2.0|I like the story and all, but the original pagination was left in, which makes for an awkward reading experience when translated to Kindle. There are just weird and seemingly random page breaks that can interrupt the reading.
B00AEFXE9U|5.0|The story line, acting and of course the great music ranks this movie as one that I enjoy watching over and over and never tire of. The actors portraying the band &#34;Stillwater&#34; are so believable  I wish they were an actual band. I would pay to see them.
0061122416|4.0|This book was for my grandson, I believe he really likes it.  I will ask him next time I talk to him
B00BN2AQL2|5.0|Their sound is great, sort of a Squirrel Nut Zippers meets rave and the vibe of Massive Attack. blah blah
B007X4ECMI|5.0|It's like the TOTAL RECALL remake with Kate Beckinsale, the action is fast phase and the lead actor is one of the villains of IRON MAN 3. Maggie Grace ( very pretty ) is the star of both LOST tv series and TAKEN / TAKEN 2 with Liam Neeson. The space battle assault scene was top notch!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A must see for animal lovers. A beautiful true story that shows animals can love deeply and remain more loyal than humans. I loved it from the first moment. You might need a tissue if your sensitive. I did.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fast moving and enjoyable story with a unique perspective on the future. Kept me wanting to read further and very hard to put down.

B001NLKXK2|4.0|A powerful story about early onset Alheimer's disease and the way the &#34;client&#34; and their copes with the wide ranging management and caring problems.
B007MDB71O|5.0|The original book was called A PRINCESS OF MARS, Disney could have called their film THE WAR FOR MARS or Martian Warrior : John Carter. Something that can translate as a Scifi Action film from multi cultural view points.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This is a really great film released in a perfect edition containing lots of information, as well as three film versions: theatrical, special and extended (available with the code 8-2-9-9-7 typed in the main menu with two-three seconds pauses after each digit)
B0036G8IQS|5.0|...will be teenagers. I really enjoyed this story. I especially liked the very teen voice. The interpretation of ADD and dyslexia being a sign of being the offspring of the gods is a very uplifting thought, and I'm certain the many kids with this problem will gain a whole new range of dreams to fill their imagination after reading this. Instead of playing video games, they'll be wanting to be an Olympian hero. Well, one can hope. We need heroes these days.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  It's very addicting.  The only thing is I wish that they gave u credits more than once a day or give more.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I have yet to be disappointed with a season of Dexter.  I keep thinking there no new angles they could take to keep my interest but they mange to keep my attention every time.  The series is definitely coming to an end and I agree 8 is it and I'm sure I will not be disappointed with it either.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A fun little app, minimal bugs. Great way to kill time. Gets awsome as you upgrade vehicles and unlock new tracks.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|The hunt for Bin Laden script was a great story but you may have to be patient on the story development. The last 15 minutes of the film on SEAL TEAM 6 mission &#34; Hunt for Geronimo &#34; was the main highlight showing the stealthy helicopters the American commandos used was worth the wait!
B0042ESTQW|5.0|It looks great and is very easy to use on my Edge 810.  It has bumps for the three surface buttons, the screen cutout is *exactly* the right size, it doesn't interfere with either the handlebar mount or the \\"out front\\" mount, and has a perfectly-sized cutout for the S and USB slots.<br /><br />Fits awesome and will definitely protect my Edge unit in case of accident or just while sitting in a pocket.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|One of the best books I've read in years.  I highly recommend this book and I look forward to reading the other books in the series.

B009NY43NY|2.0|I was actually happy that Harris decided to finish the books. I was even spoiled by the ending, sort of, but I expected...more. For one thing, this book was written and organized differently than all the other books. She strayed from first person POV, which I'm normally not against, but it was confusing and pulled me out of the story at times.<br /><br />Secondly, I didn't get closure. Things had been winding down with Bill and Eric over the course of the last few books, but they just kind of died (pardon the pun) out without any real sense of finality (it kind of works in a way, since they're immortal, but I digress). Bill and Eric, Eric especially, were the two main male characters I cared the most about, and I felt that Harris didn't offer enough closure in regards to their relationship with Sookie.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the series. I'm glad I read them, but I was ultimately disappointed in the ending, not because she didn't get with who I wanted her to get with, but because there wasn't much depth to Sookie's story's ending.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Good service and the product is good.<br />Enjoyed viewing and would recommend it to family and friends.<br />Keep up the good work.<br />Kind regards.

B001N26GFM|5.0|This is a very real movie, it shows the innocency of the children's hearts during the war.  It is a very thought provoking movie & quit distrubing to think of the horrible things that were done to innocent people, especially children during WW 2.  The movie is sad but I was drawn to watch it over & over.
1594203334|5.0|The other day, someone shared a \\"tweet\\" with me, tagged \\"DadsTalking,\\" in which a father remarks, \\"I love my son's curiosity & spirit, ...but he always comments and talks back. How do I get him to stop without stifling him?\\" This simple tweet, marked by its earnestness, angst and apprehension, concisely encapsulates American attitudes toward parenting today. In her book Bringing up Bebe: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting, Pamela Druckerman, a former journalist and American expatriate living in Paris, seeks to juxtapose American and French parenting methods. Druckerman argues that while American parents often admit that kids need limits, \\"...in practice, we're often unsure where these limits should be or we're uncomfortable policing them\\" (224). Part memoir, part cultural analysis, part childrearing manual, this book argues that while American parenting methods are likely to produce entitled, disobedient, and impetuous \\"Dylans\\" and \\"Isabellas,\\" French parenting methods are likely to produce respectful, well-behaved and disciplined \\"Pierres\\" and \\"Paulettes.\\" And on top of this, French mothers are less haggard, less sleep-deprived and more confident than American mothers. Bringing Up Bebe explores the reasons behind this discrepancy and presents a French alternative to the neurotic, guilt-ridden and vacillating American way.<br /><br />It shouldn't come as a surprise, then, that more than a few American mothers dislike this book. (Elaine Sciolino's review in The New York Times is less than glowing). Some reviewers criticize Druckerman for what they perceive to be an over-generalized misrepresentation of American mothers. Druckerman is clear about the fact that she is comparing college-educated, white, middle-to-upper-middle class American parents, particularly those who are also urban, to college-educated, white, middle-to-upper-middle class Parisian parents. Of course we all know American parents in this demographic who don't quite fit the mold she describes, but, based on my own personal reading, as well as my teaching and parenting experiences, I found her assessments to be quite accurate and very often convicting.<br /><br />I'm giving this book five stars, not because I felt a great affinity for the author while reading (especially not after I learned from a different source what she got her husband for his fortieth birthday!) and not because I agreed with every French parenting precept I found in the book. I'm giving it five stars because I loved every second of reading it, I couldn't stop talking about it over dinner with my husband, I felt compelled to write in the margins of pretty much every page, I'm already seeing the fruit of its application to my life, I want to share it with my friends - and not just those who are moms, and, most importantly, because this is the first secular resource on parenting that has not made me feel plagued with anxiety. It didn't make me feel guilty for preferring sleep schedules to co-sleeping, infant seats and playpens to habitual baby-wearing and the \\"cry-it-out\\" method to long, sleepless nights, perforated by several nursing sessions. This book confirmed what I've always believed to be true about wise parenting and served as a corrective against the areas in which I am too insecure to follow through on my resolves. And it made me laugh and feel good while I was at it.<br /><br />That being said, the ideas presented in the book are not exactly novel. I often associate Parisian women with French feminism, student protests, casual sex and aversion to religion - certainly not with traditional family structures and parenting methods. And yet, French parenting is at odds with contemporary American parenting because it rejects our progressive, child-centered, self-esteem-enhancing methods. French parenting is relatively traditional, parent-centered and authoritative. In fact, much of what I read in Bringing Up Bebe sounded very similar to what I've read from evangelical Christian author Gary Ezzo, creator of the infamous and widely disputed Babywise series. Both insist that the home be parent-and not child- centered, meaning that parents, not children, establish the family's rhythm. Both see prolonged \\"nursing on demand,\\" as entirely untenable, and advocate, instead, regular feeding schedules. Both promise to have an infant sleeping through the night by two months of age, even if it involves resorting to the much maligned \\"cry it out\\" method. (Although, Druckeman euphemistically calls the French version of the CIO method \\"Le Pause,\\" the two are essentially the same: don't pick the baby up the instant he cries, but instead assess the situation and see if he might simply be trying to settle himself down to rest; be willing to let a toddler cry at night in his crib for longer periods of time if he is refusing to sleep.) Both stress that the mother and father's relationship to one another not be sacrificed, willingly or unwillingly, to the demands of childrearing but, instead, be nourished and tended to, even if this involves setting early bedtimes for kids, establishing clear rules for mealtimes and encouraging more independent play. Both view firm and consistent discipline in a child's life as something that makes him ultimately content in his own skin and prepared for real-life challenges; it's okay for a parent to say \\"no\\" and \\"it's me who decides.\\" Both encourage parents to be sensitive to a child's needs. And both promise that these principles not only make life easier for the parents, but serve a child's best interests as well.<br /><br />Of course these methods will sound a lot more attractive to the world coming from a sophisticated, svelte Parisian woman in designer jeans than from Evangelical Ezzo. Anti-Ezzo message boards are peppered with comments like \\"dangerous and manipulative,\\" and \\"this book should be burned\\" and (my favorite), \\"It makes me SICK that they are there convincing innocent new parents how to 'raise' their children, when their own children do not even talk to them!\\" It's hard to imagine anyone saying such uncharitable things about the lovely Monique, Samine and Laurence. It's also worth noting that the values and presuppositions driving these strategies are undoubtedly different for Ezzo than I would imagine they are for most French parents. (The desire to eat smelly cheese sans interruptions from whining children probably propels much of the traditional parenting styles in France - not a firm conviction in the doctrine of original sin...) But, regardless of motivation, the parenting techniques outlined by conservative, evangelical-types share striking similarities with those of the Parisians Druckerman profiles- much to my surprise! It's not every day that \\"evangelical\\" and \\"French\\" go in the same sentence!<br /><br />While I was astonished by these similarities, Bringing Up Bebe outlines a number of distinctly French approaches to parenting, most of which are an absolute pleasure to read about. (According to Druckerman, Rousseau and French psychoanalyst Francoise Dolto are responsible for indelibly shaping French attitudes toward childrearing.) Where Gary Ezzo tends to be overly dogmatic and rigid, the French parents Druckenman observes are wonderfully nuanced, strategic and sensitive, all while maintaining their high expectations for behavior. For example, I very much prefer the French method of refining a child's palette (\\"You may be excused after you try at least one bite of every dish on your plate\\") to Ezzo's legalistic one (\\"You will stay in your highchair until that plate is licked clean!\\"). I loved the French idea of cadre - that is, building a firm framework of boundaries for a child's behavior and then giving him the freedom to move about unrestricted within those boundaries. French parents also have a wonderful category for behaviors that are perhaps mildly annoying and naughty but not worth fighting battles over. These minor infractions, over which both parents and children are meant to chuckle, are called les betises by both parents and children. (Druckerman considers a betise to be something akin to saying caca boudin, that is, \\"poop sausage.\\" ) And lastly, I love that French parents tell their children to \\"be wise,\\" instead of knocking them over the head with the overused \\"be good,\\" and I love that they give children a firm attend! (wait) when they want them to be quiet or be patient.<br /><br />It's this concept of attend! that I have found difficult to enforce as the mother of a toddler. While I've accepted that my daughter go through a brief stage of crying in her crib at night so we can all benefit from consistent sleep, I find that my resolve is a lot weaker in the face of daytime crying, which typically occurs about thirty minutes before dinner. As a result, I often find myself bouncing a toddler on my hip while trying to dodge splatterings of oil from whatever I am cooking on stovetop. The French mothers in Bringing Up Bebe and their conviction that a mother must not capitulate to the whims and fancies of a child when she has pressing domestic duties to accomplish, both for the mother's sanity and the child's good, have inspired me to reevaluate my current approach to pre-dinner mayhem. The French way is as simple as this: When I'm cooking and my daughter beckons for me to pick her up, I bend down, calmly explain that she has to wait, confident that she understands every word I am saying, and then resume dinner preparation, without feeling guilty. She usually clamors at my legs for a moment, and then toddles off to find something else to do, and within minutes, I usually hear her happily singing or babbling to herself. Upon observing this the other day, my husband exclaims, \\"I like the new French you!\\" while giving me a side-hug. His expression sobers as he considers the French predilection for extramarital affairs, and he adds, \\"Now, just don't become all French in our marriage.\\"eir children, when their own children do not even talk to them!\\" It's hard to imagine anyone saying such uncharitable things about the lovely Monique, Samine and Laurence. It's also worth noting that the values and presuppositions driving these strategies are undoubtedly different for Ezzo than I would imagine they are for most French parents.

B00571F26Y|5.0|Easy to read because Sooo informative & interesting.  I stopped (as suggested--read & you'll get it) and a 3 yr skin rash disappeared,  I wake up & can breathe clear (no longer stuffed up), my skin is softer (especially heels of feet--No longer crusted!), and I've lost weight and overall genuinely feel better.<br />This book has opened my eyes to so much. I was already a vegetarian (still am--highly suggest that too) but had bad skin problem. Then found out it could be caused from inflammation. Tried the meds to know avail then read about wheat being so inflammatory so gave William Davis' book suggestions a go and...wow...all cured and all side benefits I mentioned above.  Can't recommended this book enough!!!  Read/ do it for just 1 week and you decide if you feel better. I know you will.  Wants you know...You can't unknow...so put this knowledge to use for a healthier life and don't forget to share this wonderful knowledge.<br />Thank You So Much William Davis

0345349571|5.0|A fantastically written and often riveting introduction to the Middle Ages. I wish my brain were powerful enough to assimilate every last detail presented in this book, but, sadly, I will have to settle for just getting a flavor for the medieval period, something that this book expertly delivers. The most brilliant aspect of this book is the way Tuchman chose to organize it: She presents the life of one figure, Enguerrand VII, Sire de Coucy, a French noble who was prestigious enough in his day to merit chroniclers' attention but not so prominent and singled-out as a king, and uses the narrative of his life as a vehicle to explore the many facets of medieval life and culture. Topics addressed that I found particularly fascinating include all aspects of corruption within the Church, the figures and ideas that paved the way for the Reformation, the perpetual menacing presence of mercenary soldiers and the strategies governments used to subdue their destructive influences, chivalry in theory versus chivalry in practice, marriage during the 14th century, the medieval man's obsession with death and the macabre culture that grew up around that, the real motivations behind medieval knights' insatiable thirst for crusade, the tragic recurrence of plague and so many more. She cites a quote from another historian that I think captures the flavor of the enigmatic medieval noblemen she works so diligently to capture: \\"...in turn refined and barbaric, generous and bloody, knavish and chivalrous, above mankind in their courage and love of glory, beneath mankind in their hates, their furious follies, their duplicity and savage cruelty\\" (571).<br /><br />This book is incredibly well-done, and I look forward to checking out more from Barbara Tuchman. It took almost a year of my life to get through, and it was very much worth it.

B002WV5A9G|5.0|This movie was awesome! Action packed and had a great storyline! The change to the original storyline using the black hole/time change was awesome and opens up the franchise for so many new things! I cant wait to see the second one!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|The camera feature of the Kindle Fire HD is rather limited unless you get this app.  The main feature I was looking for and why I got this app is the time delay.  This allows you to step back to get in the picture farther away from the camera or to aim the camera somewhere other than at yourself.  There are other features I haven't had a chance to mess around with but will get to them eventually.
B00846TTDG|5.0|I've been a fan of the navy seal's for a very long time. this film shows you the team work that goes into the seals. good story line, great action scenes.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Love never dies is the sequel to what most people consider to be ALW's masterpiece: The Phantom of the Opera. While it has some great tunes (my personal favorite being \\"Till I hear you sing\\"), you might not want to go jumping in right away.<br /><br />This production comes to us via Australia, and let me tell you there is some amazing talent down under. All of the cast members are absolutely fantastic. Even the little characters leave you wanting more. The relationship between Christine and The Phantom lives on, and the chemistry here is pretty impressive. I won't give away too much detail, but I will say that those of you who know the story will enjoy the way it's portrayed here.<br /><br />That being said, fans of the original draft album will be disappointed as some of the lyrics and song order had been changed. As I said at the start, \\"Till I hear you sing\\" is my absolute favorite from this piece, but I do wish the lyrics to this piece had remained the same. Still, none of this takes away from the beauty of the show and I must say there is a lot to be had here.<br /><br />The set and character designs look like something out of a Tim Burton movie, and I love it :). They're built beautifully and it shows that this is the Phantoms territory :). Also, there is no doll for Christine. I personally always found the doll to be kind of creepy, so I don't miss it. There is a portrait, but that's far healthier than some doll (seriously, that thing is creepy).<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend that you see this production, but if you are an absolute purist, then rent it first.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|I dont know if i can even leave a review regarding the product. the show is one of my favorites and now its nice to own the complete series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very best game I've played. Keep me interested and really fun. Hard but not so hard you can't figure it out. The is always a help button but it doesn't just give the answer. I like that. I need some help sometimes but I never want the answer just given to me. Love this game!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I love all movies based on the great and beautiful Nicholas Sparks books but this one is the best to date! It's dark but beautiful!!
B0045XICB2|5.0|Great purchase I absolutely loved these books & I am not a teenager!  Buy it & give you selves some alone reading time!
B002NNA9N0|1.0|A bunch of salesmen sitting around cussing at each other. There, you now know the entire plot of the movie.<br /><br />80% of the dialog in this movie is either the f-bomb or the word \\"leads\\" and 10% is a variety of other cuss words. The rest...who even knows, and who cares?<br /><br />This movie is mind-numbing.<br /><br />And I will never be able to hear the word \\"leads\\" without twitching again.
B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|First of all Charlaine Harris is an amazing author and I know you can't please everybody with an ending.<br /><br />Most dedicated readers of this series will have seen the ending coming for a while, but it's still hard to swallow when it seems so out of character for all of those involved. Everything gets wrapped up in nice little packages so there's no wondering 'what happens next'
B0092B125A|5.0|if you are practicing or trying to properly learn how to draw hands this is the book for you. you can learn so much from this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best I love it soo fun. It is great for any age! I am completely addicted to it! Best game ever and it is free!
1936891026|5.0|I bought this book , after my son gave it to me to read, so I could give it to my daughter. My son is an artist as in painting, etc. and my daughter is a writer. This book is an inspiration for anyone who has a dream whether it's being a famous artist or writer, or just someone who wants to succeed is any field. It's easy to read and yet gives astounding advice to everyone. This is a must read book.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have a great iHome alarm clock radio, but I couldn't fit my iPhone in the jack with the otterbox on it. This was a much better alternative than having to take the case off every time I want to listen to the music.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|It was Entertaining. The Kids enjoyed it. Very different from the book but they still liked it. They would watch it again.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Nice search and find game with a couple easy puzzles thrown in. Not too difficult but very entertaining foe a few hours.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i loved it and was addicted to it until i beat every level with a star. after about two weeks i did it and it was worth it.
B005HED08I|5.0|The image quality is fantastic.  The story lines are timeless.  Better than ever.  The whole family loves to watch them.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is by far the best book yet, like omfg everyone is dead then when you think they are they aren't like wtf
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My kids loved this so much that they watched it two more times the next day!!!<br /><br />Funny movie for kids with the added in adult humor!!
B00COGXX7A|4.0|Very entertaining movie.  Most usually the end of a movie is very predictable, but I was really surprised at the end of this movie. I think both men and women would enjoy this film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway surfer I heard about how fun if was then I got it and not is it fun!!!
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|What more can i say about the dude that hasn't already been sadi. there is a reason why this is a cult classic, it is well written and the acting was spot on.
B0036OS3G0|5.0|I use to be a size 10 but I needed a size 11...but I love them...SO LIGHT and warm.I live in the mountain and Never get cold.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so addicting,major fun.... So many different things to do & so many different ways. I can play for hours.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher stories... he's my kind of guy. A hero without really trying I guess. Lee Child writes great stories and I thoroughly enjoy reading them. I don't worry too much about the occasional typo... it happens to everyone, even in the old days when it became the typesetter's fault. *grin* If you like action with a bit of a thrill, these are wonderful reads.
B003LQ3YXU|1.0|This show is just not my thing. I have tried multiple times to &#34;get into it&#34; as several friends are fanatics. just can't do it!
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I purchased this for my Kindle Fire and it never showed up in my Apps.  You need to find out what they mean by. &#34;Tablet edition&#34; before you buy
B006LSZECO|5.0|Finally a book that lives up to the hype! Twisted and engaging does not really cover it. Highly recommend to anyone really wanting to dive in an get lost in a mystery.
B000021XR5|4.0|I have been a fan of this band for years so I was surprised that they put this album out and I didn't know anything about it. It's a cool cd, and I got it at a great price. I have gotten a lot of my cd's from this company and mostly all the cd's were in better shape than what was advertised.
B001OR0AEY|5.0|Loved the history, the music, the in depth exploration of each of the members of BVSC. Very well done! My favorite video now!
B0031RS44S|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher stories... he's my kind of guy. A hero without really trying I guess. Lee Child writes great stories and I thoroughly enjoy reading them.

B000002OX5|5.0|Wonder what pirate radio in Great Britain was like in the mid-1960's?  With this album, the Who recreates it &#34;tongue and cheek&#34;.  Between the actual songs, the Who perform cuts that are radio identification and commercials.  This album stands side by side with the Beatles, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Every music collector should have a copy in their collection.
B004P7CNE0|5.0|this is a nother version of gorge orwells 1984, just with a matrix sort of twist, a good quiality dvd
0765325950|5.0|Wow! I have been reading this series of books for years, and anxiously awaiting each new book in this series. I really enjoyed this book. What a great ending to this series. I know that I will enjoy reading this series over and over again. But I will read it using my kindle app. :-)
B00000JQFM|5.0|I first bought this cd cause of the Silver Surfer on the cover cause at the time I was a big comic book collector of that character. Man what an awesome buy ,it was an awesome cassette I still have it but I wanted it on my laptop so I bought the cd and it is still awesome. I plan on buying even more Joe Satriani cd's in the near future.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Amazing story.  Amazing music. Mystery with an amazing outcome !  So glad I saw this, and I am recommending it to all my friends, especially the musicians.  I saw a clip about this on 60 Minutes and I was intrigued, so I got this video from library.  I watched it twice and decided it was a &#34;must have&#34; so got it here from Amazon, and also bought the soundtrack because the music was so good.  You won't be disappointed, except for the fact that it took so long to hear about this incredible, sweet, humble, musically gifted man.
B002APU580|5.0|This movie is one of my ultimate favorites. I know this movie word for word, literally, and I can't get enough. Love it!!
1440503257|5.0|This arrived in good condition and quite quickly. It was a delight to review with the possibility of creating future British food selections, as seen in the Harry Potter series.
B0071FBARY|5.0|I enjoy the music of the Fray.  It is mostly mellow with a little rock out thrown in.  I would recommend this CD if you have gotten any of their others.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|If you are in the mood for a family comedy or just some light hearted fantasy fun this is a good choice.  The characters were fun, the animation was slick, and the story line was fast paced and easy.  Just a good lazy evening film.
B00006V9A0|4.0|When Nirvana came out I was in the army and stationed in Germany so I didn't know much about them until I bought there first cd. Man I was blown away by the sound and the songs. I have been wanting there music again for awhile cause I got all my music stolen one year so it has been awhile since I heard Nirvana, didn't help that my babies momma hates Nirvana. Well I am not with her anymore and I had to get this cd cause it had all the songs I liked of Nirvana. Couldn't pass up the price.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|After buying several cases I finally have found one that is very good...I really like the leather and the way the Kindle Fire fits ...I am very Happy with the case
1476715904|3.0|I'm confused about all the rave reviews this book is receiving. It's not that great, nothing special. It's cute, the writing mediocre. It makes me wonder what kind of books the ppl saying it's SO great normally read. Or if they read much at all.
B000MG1ZFQ|4.0|When this album was originally released (in Vinyl), it was thought that the Doors had lost their momentum.  The music has a softer tone than the first two albums released.  If you enjoy the Doors music because of their hard-hitting music, then this album is probably not for you.  This album shows the Doors in a &#34;softer&#34; tone.  Having said that, &#34;Tell All The People&#34; and &#34;Touch Me&#34; is typically &#34;Doors&#34;.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great battery app and I have had no problems with it at all. Love the look. Like how the battery has \\"liquid\\" in it for the level of power it has left.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. I do not like any Zombie shows except this one. This story line is great, the characters are great. I just wish the seasons were closer. Come on October!!!!
B000002IZ4|5.0|It has been years since I had this cd, reason I didn't have it cause it got stolen with the rest of my collection of cd's. I like this cd then and I like it now another great buy at a great price.
B009K86D86|5.0|I just went to listen to Michael Pollan and he's funnier in person than in the movie. Still Food Inc. is the movie on food. Fresh is another one that's very similar to this one.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Beautiful bluray picture and sound captivate the magic of the Indy Jones series once again. It is like seeing an old and beloved friend and sharing adventures with them.
B004G600A4|5.0|This arrived in good condition and on time, A Christmas gift requested by our 17 year old granddaughter as one of her favorite Disney movies!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I like the fact that it's not just a cover. You can set it up on the desk or a table and it stays secure.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Book was inspiring but I did not like the way it was written. The book lacked a good story line.
B003TML0VO|5.0|I saw it really cheap and I couldn't pass it up. And man it is awesome cd cause all of the songs that are covered are from my childhood. Carlos Santana is just amazing and he brings a different feel to all these songs. Another great buy for me from a great company.
B004TI1WME|5.0|It works great and is a very handy tool that I can use often,I would this to anyone for a quick use.
B004J4X32U|5.0|Daniel Siegel has written a great book for parents, teachers, children & adolescent therapists, and anyone else wanting to help children to develop their &#34;whole brain!&#34; For the educational community, it is a great addition to the popular &#34;Love & Logic&#34; series of books on how to deal effectively with children who are struggling. In fact, for those who have not seen the desired results from the Love & Logic series, the &#34;Whole-Brain Child&#34; will lend explanations as to why it is not as effective, while also giving the reader some more very useful exercises that will help balance the child. I would definitely add this to your arsenal if you are working with children who are having difficulties managing their emotions.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This arrived on time and in good condition. A realistic, plastic version of Doctor Who's sonic screw-driver. This Doctor Who Electronic Sonic Screwdriver Replica features button-activated light and sound effects. It includes a hidden ultraviolet pen and UV light that reveals your secret writing, as well as a spare standard ink nib. Our grandson loved this!
B00CBKLO52|5.0|My grandson Edwin just love this game!  He can fly at last, like Curious George did with the geese/birds.  Wheeeee!!!!!
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|I felt like a child again watching this movie. A wonderful tale of how even a man obsessed with money and work can recapture his childhood, a childhood of goodness and innocence. A childhood full of imagination and joy and love.
B000001E21|5.0|I have a lot of Def Leppards cd's and I was wondering why I didn't have this cd, I finally broke down and bought it and BAM!!! I remembered why I bought it , it rocks!! It came in very good condition and I couldn't pass up the price. Another great buy from this company.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|This book should be a must read for any student interested in World War Two. Mr Sledge was a wonderful author and a great marine. Great man, good book.
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|Loved Theatre of the Absurd from this same company.  I thought it would be similar which it is in some ways.  However, found it quite hard and had to keep using the hint button.  Also, you had to keep going back and forth sometimes just to retrieve one item.<br />I am new to this type of gaming at this time, and that is why it may be just me.  Great graphics, music and sounds.  Worked good on my Kindle Fire HD.
B001MIVTVS|5.0|No, this is not a &#34;Best Of&#34; album, but I think it could well be.  Originally a 2-record set, this album shows Donovan at his best.  If you are looking for an album where it contains Donovan's hits, then this is not the album for you.  If you, however, are looking for Donovan at his best, then this is the album to have in your collection.
B004TI1WME|5.0|This app is well thought out with nice graphics and helpful tools. As a FAOTD,  it is definitely worth downloading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|In all means I love the game, but it will not let me buy it. It tells me it was an error though I have valid credit info. I hope they can get that fixed for me. I have it on my phone but I want a bigger screen.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Whatever your politics may be, watching these young men put their lives on the line for our freedom is truly inspirational, not to mention the intelligence teams that venture to dangerous places on our behalf.  God bless you all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Interesting book it made me read all 3 books in less then one week!!! Can't wait for more books or the movies lol...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I hope there are more rooms to come! The clues Don't give it all away but are still<br /><br /> helpful and the graphics are impressively done. I think. I'll enjoy this for a long time.
0061733199|5.0|Arrived in good condition and on time. An excellent addition to books on survival and &#34;prepping&#34;. Offers many handy and ingenious tips on &#34;making-a-go-of-it&#34; in virtually any setting. A good read, good buy and would highly recommend!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I love the fact that you can just point it at any entertainment device and it will identify what's playing...no more guesswork!  :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the challenge that it brings and the fun I have just trying to complete them. My 4 year old daughter also has lots of fun trying to dodge the trains...
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Truly one the best business reads I have had in my hands in the last few years !<br /><br />It's not common to find a book in business that is inspiring yet fact based and not coming from the personal point of view of the author.<br /><br />Thank you for writing such a useful book!
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Clever plot which twists and turns, and produces unexpected outcomes even until the final pages. Harry Hole is at his mercurial best.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|My family loves this film, watched it at the theater and could not wait to own the Blu-Ray. Highly recommend this item!
B00BMQDM10|5.0|The lengths to which the hotel staff in Greece went to in order to frustrate the poor honeymoon couple had me in gales of laughter!  I do admire Sophie Kinsella for thinking up such original and amusing scenarios, and I enjoy them very much.  Her characters are extremely real and they could almost jump off the page.  Well done!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I love using google as my search engine & was hoping for voice recognition on my searches with this, but unfortunately was not able to get it to work with this device.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|this movie is the first of its kind, in my opinion.  All actors did a great job, plot kept you on edge, and the just under 2 hrs that it lasts seems like half that.  I honestly wanted it to last longer.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I must admit, this game has kept me for hours just trying to reach certain goals. It keeps me very busy on many of days.
B009SH5JS4|5.0|Meg Ryan's fiancee goes to Paris on business and falls in love with another woman.  Meg's very uptight character,with a fear of flying, decides to fly to Paris to win back her fiancee.  Nothing goes right from the moment she gets on the plane.  She goes through one mishap after another.  It is a very funny movie with a lot of memorable lines and moments.  If you like Meg Ryan movies and chic flicks than you will definitely enjoy this movie.
B0060AY85C|3.0|So many authors have done so well with this topic. This was a poor runner runner up to Mudbound.  It was required reading for our bookclub.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My kids love this movie...begged for it forever!  We love it!  The music is very fun and catchy!  Fun entertainment!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Really, who couldn't use one of these from time to time...that solar powered one isn't going to last forever!  :)
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Finally a show where the characters are interesting.  My wife and I really love it.  I am sure you will too.
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|I LOVE this show. I've watched every episode about 5 times. I really can't wait to own season 8 & every season after that
B00BXHLM1K|1.0|Admittedly, my review comes, not from the DVD, but from televison's \\"Great Performances at the Met\\" presentation<br />Before the performance began, an opening segment indicated that portions of the presentation might be offensive to some people.  How right they were.  The entire production was offensive to me.  And, in her opening remarks, Renee Fleming said, \\"Here is OUR (capitals for emphasis) Rigoletto.\\"  And so it was; it was certainly not Verdi's Rigoletto.<br />Beyond taking the story totally out of context, the biggest problem was that the character and relationships of Rigoletto are never clarified.  At one point, he sings, \\"I have to do what the Duke tells me.\\"  Why?  What was the hold the the Duke has over him?  In Verdi's Rigoletto, he is the jester in the Duke's court, and that makes sense.  And, why do all the other courtiers despise him so?  In Verdi's Rigoletto, he constantly taunts them.  Why does Monterone curse him?  (Actually, the English subtitles imply that he is cursing the Duke.)  In Verdi's opera, Rigoletto has made fun of Monterone's concern for his daughter.  As the Classical Review reviewed, \\"Verdi seemed only a peripheral concern\\" in this production.<br />When I was twenty years old, the Met came to the city where I lived, one of only three times they toured to that city.  I was not interested; but my wife coerced me to attend with her.  The production was Rigoletto, with Robert Merrill, Jan Peerce, and Roberta Peters.  (I have tried, unsuccessfully, to find who designed that production.)  That was when the opera bug bit me.<br />I am grateful that they were not playing this Michael Mayer production.  If they had been, my disdain for opera would have intensified, and I would have missed sixty years of opera enjoyment.<br />That rumbling sound you hear is Verdi turning over in his grave.
B004GYY714|5.0|I live in an area where I receive only one station.....and quite frankly, I'm not fond of it.  THIS program has allowed me to listen to MY type of music.  :) :)  I've not used it long....but I'm happy so far!.
B0082Z1CVQ|1.0|My mom talked about how much she loved this book and the movie....boy was she ever wrong. This was a bork g book with hardly any funny parts. I didn't even finish the book. No thanks.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Movies like Big , and Freaky Friday turn concepts on their ear with outlandish premises. It was great to see Seth McFarlane do the same with the movie albeit a little more risque! I laughed until I cried.
B00B5DWI2O|5.0|The Icelandic tundra may frequently be frozen, but Arnalds somehow brings forth verdant pastures with each release. A master of heart- wrenching, and cascading beauty.<br />Do explore the rest of his catalog as well as the supernal releases he has gathered on the cracking Erased Tapes label.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I find this very obtuse and difficult to understand.  It is an amazing story particularly since the author is a neurosurgeon.  It really testifies that there is consciousness beyond what is expected from a purely scientific view.  More questions than answers, but interesting.  It feel that the author did resolve psychological issues with his being adopted and I am happy for him. I am always happy when people are able to resolve conflict in their lives.  Truth is always stranger than fiction!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Runs smooth and is very fun.kind of addicting too not gonna lie. Really suggest getting it. You wont be dissappointed
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|i love it its got the graphics the plot the whole package definetly recommend it to action gamers that love a good game.
B001DUDKEY|3.0|Being an Austin fan helped me hang in there with this movie. Perhaps if your auditory processing skills are super sharp, you will enjoy it more than I. I struggled, particularly early on in the movie, following the British dialogue. I would try to increase the volume and replay, but that didn't really help. And there's nothing wrong with my hearing. However, that being said, the story is sweet and a study of a lifestyle that is quite foreign to 2013 America! Being somewhat of a historical fiction fan, made it worthwhile from that perspective. I would recommend it  for an escape from the speed of our overcommitted lives.
0385738781|3.0|Thank goodness this is the last book!<br /><br />This was a fun series all in all but my goodness... enough is enough.  It's like a bad dream where one wakes up only to find out they are still sleeping and wakes up again... but hold on... they are still sleeping!  A dream in a dream in a dream in a dream.<br /><br />That's how these trials went on... and on...<br /><br />I will say though... I was pleasantly surprised with reading this final book because I could not tell if this story was yet another trial or not.  I kept thinking it was...  but I won't say... you'll have to read.<br /><br />Ironically enough, I think what soured me the most with this series is when the Prequel came out, The Kill Order.  That book was sooooo bad!  The tone, the flow, the violence... everything about that book was different from the other three.  I question whether it was truly written by the same author.<br /><br />But, it was so bad... it soured me to this book.  My wife agreed.  She read this too.<br /><br />So, seems like this is a pretty negative review... sorry for that.<br /><br />The book was actually OK.  I'm glad I read this and I found out what happens in the end.  It was a pretty quick read... and I would recommend it.  IF you got through the other 3 books... then it's worthy to finish the saga with this one.<br /><br />Thanks
B003O86FMW|4.0|This one stuck in my mind, it seems so very short and yet it keeps you on the edge wondering what's going to happen to the very end. The cliffhanger makes up for that shortness and leaves you begging for the final book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My almost 7 yr. niece got this game first and loved it so much she told me I had to have it. She was right, I love this game. It gives me something I can share with her and my children. I highly recommend this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another hit in the series.  It kept me guessing the whole way. Not only is there  tons of action this book is written in a manner that makes it so easy to read
B00AREIAI8|5.0|something fun to do during the day. I have fun with the mini games and the competitions can be challenging.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is my first adventure into true JRPG style games, simply amazing. I find myself getting lost in the game for hours - it's extremely addicting. If you're thinking of buying it...just do it!
B007MHVVCU|4.0|I found this to be an entertaining book.  It has supernatural, some science fiction, some action, drama, etc.  It's clearly for young adults/teens.  Even though the ending was a touch anti-climactic... it did make me look forward to book 2.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book has its ups and downs, and there are a few slow parts while you're grinding your teeth trying to figure out what's going to happen. There are even times where you'll have to read back to keep up with what's happening. Too many names. However, when I got to the last chapters,  I was glad I'd stuck through it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I like it because it is not difficult to read provided the reader has a fair command of the English language. Almost everything about Paris(human relations-society-history) in the early 19th century.One of the world's masterpieces of literature.Everybody interested about (literature) should read.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Easy read. The book jumps around interviewing survivors after the zombie war. Could not put it down after I started reading it!
B0093X80VQ|5.0|This book was super.I think my class would love the book.<br />I love how they went into space and got invited to the Whitehouse.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is so addictive but I just wish I could upgrade it like the version on my iPod, but it will have to do.
193700788X|5.0|I can't understand all the negative comments....maybe because there will be no more books? Yes,I am VERY sad to see the series end. The Stackhouse books were very enjoyable and well written. But if it had to end, Ms. Harris ended the series in the best possible way. I really liked how she managed to bring just about every single character that was in the series at one time or another back together. I disagree with the description that Sookie is \\"shocked\\" by Eric. I don't think anyone (including Sookie) who paid any attention to the series was shocked on how that unfolded.<br /><br />Essentially the end of the series brings together all the characters that perceived that Sookie somehow injured or hurt them in previous books. They are bent on getting back at Sookie and seeking revenge (even murder). Yes, part of the book was predictable, but enjoyable none-the-less. The biggest surprise to me was the identity of one of the major characters that wanted revenge/murder of Sookie. I thought it very clever.<br /><br />I found the ending complete. It ended in a way I had been hoping from, I think, the beginning of the series. Bravo Ms. Harris for entertaining us for so long!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|We loved this game, and we can't wait for the next one! We played it with our young child and we all enjoyed working together to solve it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Found this series compelling.  Each episode FLEW by.  Highly recommended.  Good character development.  Season Two was even better,  I love all the BBC series think they are geared more to the intelligent viewer,
193700788X|4.0|I gave it 4 stars, because I wasn't happy with how the series ended. Loved all the books and am sad to see the series come to an end.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Love this show. There are interesting dynamics between characters, and well written comefic situations. Sexy and a bit politically incorrect too. Worth it just for the character \\"Schmidt\\".

B0089LOKHG|1.0|I usually don't write reviews. But I have to inform you about the book. The end of the book is confusing and doesn't really settle the love triangle or the war between the two sides; cured and invalid.<br />Overall, I was hoping to say that the one star reviews were wrong but I can't.<br />To sum up, the end of the book leaves you saying \\"WTF?!\\"<br />-a 13 year old who read this book series in only two days
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved reading this book.  It was very interesting to have the story be told from two character's points of view.  Most of the characters were very likable and I cared deeply about them.  It was easy enough to read and even the dialogue of the slaves was no problem to understand.  Very well written and I could easily visualize the setting and the characters.  I belong to a book club and will definitely pass this book on to friends and other book clubs.  Just a wonderful and heartfelt read!
B00COGY2P2|2.0|Very disappointed with this movie..wouldn't recommend it..one of his weakest movies yet..I hope oblivion is a better movie, if not? No more Tom cruise movies for me

B0096YJDNQ|4.0|Used this app before there were apps. I purchased Distant Suns years ago and it was a great program on my PC. I was surprised when I found out that all support had stopped, all updates stopped and as a loyal customer I was S-O-L. Having never used an Apple product, and never will, I looked for other programs and found them. When I came across this app I thought why not. It is ok but not as nice as it was on a full platform application. The night sky is a little large to be using a smart phone to view and learn.
0545265355|5.0|Better than the movie.  I've already passed it on to a friend to enjoy.  Convenient getting all the books at once.
B000GCFBQU|5.0|This is a well-wrought novel with all the elements that make for a good book--a good story well told, characters who deserve to have you care about them and a theme of significance. I kept wondering where Strout developed all the spiritual insights that she bestows on her very endearing main character. It's one of those books you are sorry to finish because you've grown to love the characters. This is one of Strout's best.
B004478AS4|4.0|I know this is a classic, but I'll be honest, it took me a LONG time to get into this book. Looking back, I think I know why. The narration is very cold, detached, and matter of fact in tone. I'm simply not used to that in fiction. I forced myself to read on, and I'm really glad I did.<br /><br />The story about wrestler, warrior, and tribe leader, Okonkwo is disturbing, infuriating, and tragic. The book chronicles his background and development as a leader. His mistakes as man and how it pushes him into exile. When he returns, he discovers that white missionaries have settled in his village and have converted many of his tribe. Connected to these missionaries, a government is built, and slowly it takes over and began to dismantle the way of life that Okonkwo has always known. When he fights against this, it has tragic results.<br /><br />This book is very interesting because of its tone. The detached narration ends up working beautifully, and amplifies the impact of the story. There's no investment or judgement by the author in either the protagonist or the later characters who come in disrupt a way of life. Okonkwo's way of life is presented in a objective way that forces you to confront your own feelings, instead of adopting the author's. And I found myself quite angry with the way women were treated in this book, but also acutely aware that I was passing judgement on Okonkwo's way of life based on my own worldview. In the absence of the judgement of the narrator, I was left with my own, and that was unsettling because I know people live like Okonkwo and his tribe, and I know I am not really in a position to pass judgement on any group's way of life. Who am I to say they are wrong? Yet I felt strongly that many of their practices were wrong.<br /><br />This is all turned on its head though when the missionaries are introduced because they actually tell the tribe they are wrong, and then take action to change their way of life. I had a strong negative reaction tothis as well, which meant I had to wrestle and reconcile my own judgement about Ononkwo and his tribe. Whatever their practices, the missionaries slow erosion and rise to power seems like the greater of two evils.<br /><br />This story has stayed with me for a few days, and I really attribute that to the way the story was told
1480054542|4.0|★★★★ Finding Pride by Jill Sanders<br /><br />I was given this book as a R2R in exchange for my honest opinion.<br /><br />So, I know the saying goes, \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover,\\" but I tend too. Normally, if the cover doesn't spark my interest, I'll pass, because I have way too many books, on my TBR shelf. So in all honesty, I would have let this one pass, because it doesn't speak to me. When the author asked me to read it, she also showed me the book trailer. This got my curiosity. Which I'm glad, because I would have missed out on a really good book.<br /><br />When her brother, Matt, calls wanting her to visit, all she as to do is heal first. Megan, has finally escapes her abusive ex-husband and she needs to rebuild her life. The abuse has always been hidden, and she could not bear the thought of her brother finding out. While waiting on all the signs of abuse to fade away, her brother's life is tragically cut short.<br /><br />When she arrives at his funeral, she realizes, there was so much more to her brother. She finds that the entire town loved and respected him. The town of Pride, also welcomes her, with open arms and tons of food. And she realizes, that this could be just what she needed, to start over.<br /><br />Megan, learns that it's harder to escape abuse, than just getting away. She learns that she does matter, and people do value her. When helping a local artist she realizes, that everyone, needs a little help.<br /><br />She falls in love with her brother's best friend, Todd, although she feels she should not. The thought running through her mind is, how can she ever trust a man, again. And as often the case, you can't run from the past, it will always catch up with you.<br /><br />Although editing was a major issue, and I found it to be fairly predictable in spots, I really enjoyed this book, and look forward to the next in the series.<br /><br />Thanks to the author for allowing me to visit the town of Pride, and meet so many nicepeople.

B00CL0J99K|3.0|When one person said that Shane Black took a stab at the Marvel Universe, thats exactly what he did and made a mess! The action was good the story was Meh, and the worst part of it is Mandarin wasn't Mandarin and that was odd to me and even worse when you find out hes not actually Mandarin as he presents himself as a comedian type giggling and cracking jokes SMH. And a Disney flik is never complete without the help from a Cutsie kid that no one cares about (unless your 9) especially in a Marvel film like this. I was dreading the day when Disney decided to put a commercialized stamp on the Iron-Man franchise and ruin it! Well at least I got to enjoy the Avengers!

First, there's a \\"rub your nose in it\\" not at all subliminal \\"haves vs. have nots\\" statement and virtually everything else is fairly predictable. However, for all of the predictable action scenes there still seems to be no satisfactory conclusion to the story.<br />Perhaps this is a consequence of there being no substantial \\"story\\" to begin with. Rather, this seems like an idea that had layers of entertaining action added on with no more thought given to a plot line. Maybe there's more to come.

B0028R3NCU|5.0|Sleek, fast, and super-tiny.  I bought a few different MicroSD readers at once because they keep breaking / getting lost on me and they are super cheap.  This is my favorite of them all.  It's half as thick as the tiny &#34;inside the USB port&#34; type (ELAGO is an example), and it also stays cool even with extended use whereas the other type where the card is *inside* the USB slot have all gotten uncomfortably hot to the touch after extended use, from my experience with four different models so far.  This can't be good for the life of the card...<br /><br />5 stars for form factor and function.  Minus half a star because there is no activity light, but plus back that half star because it actually fits on my keychain well and is flat, like, you know, keys...<br /><br />I love this one and will buy it again in a heartbeat when I inevitably loose it...

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|After recently reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" for the first time (and loving it!), I went searching for a movie or mini series to further bring the story to life. Something about this particular incarnation grabbed my attention - as I browsed, sampling video clips and reviews, I found myself hooked. I bought the DVD and watched it through (not a small investment of time, yet it doesn't feel as long as it is!).<br /><br />In details, the story is different than the book in many ways, yet it felt true to the spirit, story, and flow of \\"Jane Eyre.\\" Even though there was one change I found I didn't agree with.<br /><br />In the miniseries, Mr. Rochester and Jane's interaction after the wedding and the dramatic reveal (this interaction takes place in Jane's bedroom, recalled in flashbacks) left me feeling that the story had been cheated out of some of its strongest moments, including my favorite speech by Mr. Rochester and Jane's show of fiery independence even when she must stand up against the raging passion of the man she loves. The way the miniseries tells the story, Jane seems incredibly passive in her assertion of self and Mr. Rochester much gentler (although admittedly, still as persistant if not as bull-headed about it).<br /><br />Although I didn't love the changes they creatively made to this scene, overall it didn't take away from my deep enjoyment of the rest of what was done with this show - and I feel that I understand why they made the changes they did (even if those changes aren't my favorite).
B001DF68MA|5.0|My daughter loo-o-oved this the first few rides we've taken on it and she keeps asking me to &#34;go faster!&#34;  She's a generally cautious / fearful personality -- I am pretty sure the front platform and lower, encircled position make her feel safer than she would feel in say an iBert, rear seat, or trailer.  I love that her head is right next to mine so we can talk very comfortably even when driving through quite loud areas.  After installing the seat, I mounted a bell on the handlebars that she can reach and she loves to &#34;ding&#34; a large fraction of the people and birds we pass.  My wife was NOT excited in general about me taking our daughter on bike rides in traffic but after seeing the seat she grudgingly agrees it looks safe compared to the alternatives considered.  She even let me take her on a 5 mile ride to daycare which is a strong testament to the apparent safety of the seat, believe me.  Mounting system is very substantial and heavy.  I love this as it gives me a high level of confidence that even if one or even *two* of the bolts failed for some unbelievable reason, the seat would not go crashing down.  The mounting system has gravity as a fallback: even if there were some catastrophic failure, your child is supported by the top tube of the bike and within easy reach of your arms.  Four very minor issues that don't dissuade me in any way:  1) Can't stand up and have to ride with knees splayed.  This is true even after you drop your kid off at daycare so don't expect to be making record time with this mounted on the bike.  To mitigate this inconvenience, it's very, very easy to remove the seat but leave the mounting system if you don't need it for a while.  2) The foot rests are not very low, even in the lowest setting.  Our daughter is short for 2.5 years old and even she finds them a bit too high, and took her feet out a couple times until I explained that was not safe.  (Actually it doesn't seem like she'd get her feet anywhere near the wheeleven with them free, just being paranoid...)  3) When no child is in the seat the footrests shake and vibrate quite a bit making a racket.  Could have been solved by putting a simple plastic brace between them to stop the shaking.  4) (likely specific to my bike).  My handlebars are narrow and occasionally she puts her hands around the platform and gets bumped by the brake cables around turns.  She complains quietly about it, nothing serious...  I would buy this again if we got another bike seat... which we may, given that #2 will be able to ride in a few more months!  UPDATE 8/2015: This still gets regular use as a commuter seat for our #2!  We went for a rear seat for the second seat as our eldest outgrew this seat.  Her legs get bumped by the flat bike handlebars now when I turn even though she is still easily within the weight limit for the seat.  Depending on their size, I'd say this seat may last to a child reaching age 2.5-3.5 years.  Very happy with this seat and it has held up very well to our level of use (couple times a week commuting 5 miles each way to childcare, weekend rides from time to time.)
B007VTUYWW|4.0|I liked the video game, so it was fun to see it come to life as a movie. Angelina Jolie is a good choice for Lara and I liked the storyline between Lara and her missing father along with the connection with Illuminati.<br />Enjoyable.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have been shaking my head in amazement at the badmouthing of Russell Crowe as Javert.  I have seen Les Miserables on Broadway, and was thrilled by it (like hundreds of thousands of other people) but the stage is the stage and a movie is a movie, and both versions of Les Miz are marvelous, each in its own way.<br />  Now a word about the performance of Russell Crowe.  He does not have a big singing voice, like the stage Javerts.  But his interpretation of this character I found to be haunting.  He, and the director, and Hugh Jackman, must have gotten together and decided upon a fascinating approach to the relationship between Valjean and Javert, that is, that they are two sides of the same person, Jean Valjean, who may be imagining this whole story as he suffers in his chains, and is preparing himself to die.  Javert is his other self, the devil inside, whom he is struggling to conquer.<br />  Think of how improbable Javert's movements are, in the context of real life (as opposed to a convict's despairing fantasy).  First he is a prison guard (probably intended to be his actual role.)  Then he is the police chief in Montreuil sur Mer. Then somehow he turns up in Paris at the barricades and is attached to the military.  Then he becomes a spy for the soldiers.  Then he is freed by Valjean and turns up again in full military uniform.  What's going on here?  IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PROBABLE.  It is Valjean fantasizing wildly. Trying to rid himself of the devil within.<br />  Because Crowe cannot deliver the big operatic baritone of the stage Javerts,<br />the director did something clever for the \\"stars in their multitudes\\" song, he provided a spectacular background instead, an eyepopping panorama of Paris beneath a high parapet, with a gargoyle next to Crowe in a prominent position (the devil within).  I defy you to forget that setting.<br />  I also remember Crowe placing his medal on the chest of the corpse of little Gavroche, a tender gesture worthy of Jean Valjean, and tying the two men together in yet another way.<br />  There are many other instances I could cite, but I will leave you to find your own. I challenge people who heap scorn on Russell Crowe's interpretation to find a stage performance of such subtlety and humanity.

B002ZG9940|4.0|The protagonist is reserved and very skilled at keeping his real job a secret, and is aptly played by unusually subdued performance from George Clooney. A man of few words, his work seems to encompass being a gun for hire, but his skills also extends to making custom-making firearms specified for individual Assassins. Through a series of incidents he is forced change location rapidly as he tries to find out who is trying to kill him thus unfolds a moody thriller with majestic back drops of the Italian countryside.<br /><br />This film is not for everyone, as this film is short on discourse & action BUT has lashings of atmosphere and amazing photography. The Blu-ray has good extras and the picture quality is very good, in my opinion. A film, that for me is well deserving of a good four stars.

B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|I've listened to this album about 8 times now, and it already feels like an old friend. The writing here is refined, confident, sincere, and lean. These tunes strike an almost ideal balance within the prog-rock spectrum, remaining focused, accessible, and melodic and avoiding self-indulgence while featuring some wonderful meanderings, loose adherence to strict time signatures, and luscious bombast. Lyrical content is excellent as well, wistful and personal and subtle (and the lyrics are included in the nicely packaged double-CD I own). During some of the softer parts, such as in \\"We Got Used to Us,\\" I was reminded of Blackfield II (an excellent album in its own right, although SoNGS surpasses it as a complete and cohesive work). The album's nearly thirteen minute opus, \\"Escalator Shrine,\\" mixes so many elements so successfully (I'm reminded of snippets of albums as disparate as \\"Liberty\\" by Duran Duran, \\"Boingo\\" by Danny Elfman, and \\"The Wall\\") that it creates a rare musical euphoria for me.<br /><br />I feel like this kind of came out of nowhere. I was aware a new Riverside was on the way but my anticipation wasn't too high. I had enjoyed Anno Domini High Definition but was kind of lukewarm on the earlier works. As it turns out, SoNGS is an album that makes its own niche and wins you over by doing just about everything right, and then becomes so easy to put on 'repeat' and so hard to take out of the CD player. Refreshing.<br /><br />Mariusz Duda has one of those voices that makes me wish he could grace all my favorite music with his vocals (Andrew Gillespie of Floating Me and Allen Epley of The Life and Times also fall into that category). It's a similar tone to Sel Balimir and even Bob Pollard, emotive but vital with a hint of smokiness.<br /><br />Special mention must be made of the sound. I would almost consider this an audiophile rock recording. Load it up in a WAV editor (like EAC) and you can see there is no brickwalling, no clipping, and an appropriate levelof compression with decent dynamic peaks and micro-peaks. The recording and mixing are top notch as well. The instrument tones and percussion miking are so warm, balanced, and non-fatiguing, it would be a shame to listen to this as data compressed MP3s. It really deserves an audio system of decent quality (and is outstanding headphone music for full-size quality 'phones). I could still wish for the even greater dynamic range of yesteryear (pre-1992?) but it is definitely a cut above a lot of its contemporaries.<br /><br />Highly recommended, a true five-star slice of art.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great story by Grisham that shows how bilnd Justice can be...evern when you are innocent.  Like in the Firm and other Grisham tales the hero, Attorney Malcolm Bannister (who really knows the law) uses that knowledge to not only vindicate himself, but to get revenge.  A page turner.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I didn't think this was quite the best of Dan Brown's books. It was certainly exciting but after a while it just seemed to get progressively unbelievable. I saw that Noetic Science does exist but humans breathing liquid like air was beyond my belief system. And then towards the end the story just seemed to drag on as if it should have ended a couple of chapters earlier. I do wish some of the ideas he talked about could or would come true. Our world would be a much better place if people could be so enlightened. How wonderful would it be if all religions understood that no matter how many names G-d has, He is still the one true G-d and that whatever peaceful way<br /> we choose to celebrate Him is good in His eyes.

125000098X|3.0|\\"Secret\\" is the third of a planned 5-book saga about the Clifton family of Great Britain, as well as their close friends the Barringtons. We were somewhat surprised that while this entry spans the period of 1945 to about 1958, the just concluded World War gets hardly a mention. Rather, the story now centers more on Harry and Emma's son Sebastian and his years finishing high school and bound for Cambridge. Early on, the debate over Harry's paternity, and therefore the inheritance of the Barrington estate, is resolved; so that settles the cliffhanger from book 2. Later, Giles Barrington is involved in an election rigging scheme as he runs for re-election to Parliament; his troubles with a new wife and an insider trading scam with the family's shipping company also absorb a lot of ink. Finally, an adventure with Sebastian disappearing on a trip to Buenos Aires to unwittingly abet a smuggling attempt concludes this third tale. Once again, a cliffhanger has us anxiously awaiting the next installment.<br /><br />While we continue to find Archer's extended yarn engaging, it seemed the \\"setup\\" work in \\"Secret\\" got a little long and dry. The relatively abrupt departure of Harry's involvement apparently signals that the next generation is now center stage - and where that might lead is by no means obvious. While we realize we readers are being masterfully strung along, and have no reservations about following the set to its conclusion, we somehow didn't muster quite the same enthusiasm with this outing. Nonetheless, our burning through this latest in just a couple of days echoes our ultimate enjoyment.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|Follows the book well enough.  Good characterization, costuming and details.. One failure is the poor attention to music .  jackson did great on that area for the Trilogy and forgot all about it for the Hobbit.  Very sad.  Best song is the one song by the dwarves-actual actors voices- The commercial  version is by vocal artist and doesn't have near the power.  No other music is of note..

B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I am so unhappy with this game right now. I had already had so many problems with it before, and it was working fine for the longest time, only for me to try to access it today, and it to not work. I tried accessing the game earlier this morning, then in the afternoon, and then in the late night, and still nothing. The game continued to try to download futher mb, and then crash.<br /><br />My only option was to uninstall, and i was okay with that, sometimes a fresh start after you know what to do will be okay. Yet THEN, the game STILL doesnt work. What can i do after already reinstalling the stupid game? You would think that doing that would fix any previous problems. Apparently i was wrong, and now have no data to prove for it,  all that time wasted when i was a level 23. How disapointing. I am going to be so angry when i try to open the app tomorrow, and it ends up working. Might just uninstall it for good if it does.

B005MTHRAA|2.0|Pier Paolo Pasolini (1922-1975) was an Italian filmmaker who more or less aligned himself with a film as non-art movement that was passingly fashionable among certain arts intelligentsia from about 1955 to about 1975.  His films usually show a mix of hand-held and static camera and have a slow pace punctuated with fits of male nudity, significant violence, and coarse humor; they also often have deliberately annoying soundtracks, a wave of noise.  Critics of the era were not particular kind; reassessing critics have not been particularly kind; and today Pasolini is probably better known for the mysterious circumstances of his death (he was murdered by being run over repeatedly with his own car) than for any of the films he made.<br /><br />According to legend, Pasolini was on friendly terms with the great opera diva Maria Callas (1923-1977.)  Among Callas' noted roles was the lead in Luigi Cherubini's MEDEA, a fairly straight forward adaptation of the ancient Greek tragedy by Euripides.  By 1970, however, Callas' voice had failed, and when Pasolini suggested she play the role for him, it was as an actress instead of a singer.<br /><br />The story is clearly drawn from Eurpides' MEDEA, but it is in a roundabout way.  The first fifteen minutes or so of the film is preoccupied with a centar, sometimes in hilariously bad costume and sometimes not, lecturing the young Jason on his history and future duties.  This then drifts into an argicultural fertility rite that involves the sacrifice of a young man, the dismemberment of his body, and the burial of his parts in various crop fields.  Precisely what any of this has to do with anything isn't clear, and it isn't until Medea (Callas) catches sight of Jason (Giuseppe Gentile) and decides to steal the golden fleece for him that the film begins to feel at all like the classic story of Medea that most people know.<br /><br />Even then, it flits and fiddles.  Plot points are skipped, leading to significant confusion; a time loop is inserted, leading to even more significant confusion; and oddly, the climatic moment in which Medea murders her children is actually played in an almost throw-away fashion.  The soundtrack is typically noisy, but to no point, and the pace is slow, slow, slow.  The costumes are accidentally hilarious.  The whole thing looks rather like a band of hippies lost in Arabia, a mishmash of Jarman and Fellini rolled around in the sand.  The only thing that makes the film worth watching is Callas.  Her eyes are startling and her face is powerful, and everything about her makes you aware that this is indeed a great presence.  It is obvious that she is inexperienced as a film actress, but her presence is such that you wonder what would have happened if she had pursued other film projects.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a trailer, which is almost as boring as the film itself, and the documentary CALLAS by Tony Palmer, which is interesting but lacks the depth one would like to see.  All things considered ... I say go out and buy some Callas recordings.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Revieweris inserted, leading to even more significant confusion; and oddly, the climatic moment in which Medea murders her children is actually played in an almost throw-away fashion.

B008OOYALE|5.0|I love dragon story! I play it, my son plays it, and my husband just started playing. There are currently 122 dragons you can get, endless combinations to make them, and you don't have to use the in-game purchase feature if you don't want to. That being said, I have been guilt of spending some serious money to speed up a hatch or breed, but that's my own impatience. Also, there are some dragons, buildings, and things to do on the Apple version that isn't available to Android users and that's really frustrating. All in all 5 stars though!
B00BEWCK8I|5.0|Let me start off by saying that Blind Melon is my absolute favorite band and that Shannon Hoon is the greatest person to ever walk the face of the planet (okay... maybe a bit of an exaggeration :P ).<br /><br />The *ONLY* thing that would keep this album from getting a 5 star rating (which I am going to give it anyway, since this album is just fantastic) is that the one I ordered came in one of those cardboard cases, rather than the plastic one, which was kind of disappointing, since I ordered the 20th anniversary edition. I was hoping that since it was the 20th anniversary of their first album that at least the case would be nicer and I was hoping for maybe a little article about the band, even though I've read all of the other little things in their other albums (including the bonus material on Nico) and their book... so it's not like I'd be reading anything I don't know, but it would have been nice to include. Oh well.<br /><br />Now, let me also say that the almost the whole reason I bought this was because of the studio version of the song Mother. I have the original copy of the cd and yes, I paid around $12 for mostly one song (again, I was hoping for a nicer cd as a collector of all things Melon, so just the mp3 would not do at all). I have been looking for a studio version for a good many years now and I finally got to listen to it for the first time. It literally made me tear up. I absolutely LOVE Blind Melon and I was so glad to get some of the Sippin' Time Session demos, even though most were re recorded and then released on Soup and Nico.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game! It has vivid graphics, an engrossing storyline, and great ambient music. The puzzles were challenging but not at all frustrating. I can see why this won an award last year. It reminded me of Myst, if I remember that game after not having played it for a long time, but everything is packed in an easy to navigate world, or room, if you will. Got it free with Amazon's new coin offer, but I would've gladly shelled out the $2 for this game. The only bad thing is that I have to wait awhile for the next installment!
B000X5SPBI|3.0|Everything was all good until I opened it all the way and saw the corner was bent in. Other than that it was good so 85%.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|only hope is stays back in that era, and does not advance to much into todays time think it might loose some charm if it does

B00AW28HF6|4.0|The Tsunami Connection is a complex, intelligent and briskly paced spy adventure. Its story is told from the perspective of a Mossad (National Intelligence Agency of Israel) agent, and as such is an original slant on a tried and tested formula. As is common for spy adventures, it hops around the world from country to country & glamorous location to location, and features a multitude of characters, all of whom have varied allegiances and motivations. The story of the central character, Kefira, unfolds slowly over the course of the book, and soon a picture of a three dimensional protagonist emerges - not always a likeable character, but a believable one none the less. The pacing of the story is just about right, and there are a few surprises along the way to challenge your expectations. At the end of the book, there are a number of plot threads and character destinies which are left open, no doubt for the inevitable sequel. I know some readers don't like this and want everything tied up in a neat bow, but personally I like open ended stories. They allow you to wonder about the characters and events to come and make you feel like the story is part of a larger world. And it leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />If I were to criticize, I would say that the story does have a tendency to jump around in time and location with little or no warning or transition, occasionally causing you to backtrack just to check when and where you are. Also, there were a few times where I found the descriptions of key scenes a little workmanlike and matter of fact, when they should have been powerful or dramatic. These are however minor criticisms and I commend the author's carefully structured plot, characterization and storytelling ambition, and as such I would happily recommend this book to any fans of the genre. It is a promising start from a first time author.<br /><br />Note that I was gifted a copy of this book in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I am totally hooked on this cd. I listen to it several times a week. I like some of the tracks that I have not heard on the radio such as bad rain and hard and fast.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I started a additiction to Minecraft (after the first minute I played it) on the xbox 360 I saw this one for tablet I decided what the hell I downloaded it and started playing these are what the pros and cons are in this game<br /><br />Pros): A option to change the graphics make them more fancy you could change your guys name from Steve to the name you desire<br /><br />Cons): There are no animals no creepers no anything but I think there's a option to change that but most likely no option some features are missing from the other minecraft versions the controls take a while to get use to probably because I'm use to the game controller<br /><br />don't hate this minecraft version minecraft is still bad ass though
B0050DZN4K|4.0|As a google reader user I needed to find a replacement.<br />I highly recommend this app as a replacement. I use it on my Kindle Fire and my netbook and say \\"goodbye reader\\" I have found something better!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game really enjoyed!  Wish it was longer! So excited for the sequel to come out so I can play it.
B006F8HZYK|2.0|The Elements of Style is a great style guide; however, the illustrations in the Kindle version are nothing more than a few photos of old typewriters.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The Hobbit was a fantasy feast with lots of different components that worked together well. I enjoyed the concept of the trolls losing their home and treasure to a dragon and being enemies with the orges. The ending gave me hope and ready to go in December to the next part of the series.

B001JAFYFG|5.0|I loved this movie from my younger days.<br />It came as promised and new.<br />The blu-ray transfer is a bit fuzzy, but, very watchable.<br />Although there is little, as far as extras, the film is intact as I remember it and brings back many memories, pre &#34;Star Wars&#34;!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very easily understood weather data, specific for my area.  Forecast for coming days and other details are very good. Thanks.
