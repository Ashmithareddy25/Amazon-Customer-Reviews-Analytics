B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love Kathy Reichs books!  I've read 14 of them and haven't ever been disappointed!! I would recommend them to anyone that likes mystery and crime and a little love!!
B001UV4XUG|5.0|It is a really nice story that I think a lot of people can relate to. I know I do.
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|I was lucky enough to see Epitaph in person and it was an honor. Being able to relive that night with this DVD was well worth the purchase price. If your a fan of the Priest you have to own this DVD.
B00011CZRE|5.0|What else can I say. If you haven't seen this movie, then you should. Now! The characters are amazing and the script will keep you on full attention. A collectible!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This started out like the first, but towards the end the plot actually involved some action. I'm curious if the next book will include more adventure, or go back to more of Eva and Gideon constantly  meeting their needs through sex.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|Really enjoyed th book. Lots of energy and action. Shape shifting war. And in all this young love and heartbreak.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|Honestly, I love The Hobbit. I read the book a few times and I love LOTR. This movie pretty much botched the whole thing for me. They expand way too much on small details that are only just barely mentioned in the books, if at all, and it comes off far more as a fan fiction remake. I hope the next two installments are better. I was sorely disappointed with this one.
B009PK9SB8|3.0|The LCD is great to have but it is on of those accessories that uses up the battery life to fast. I use it about 10% of the time when I am using the camera in the car and when on surveillance.  Now if it was Bluetooth to the camera and had is own power supply it would be a must have item.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is legit, anyone who gets this game is going to love it! There is absolutely no glitches at all in this game and you get to up grade your armor and face New villains it's amazing!!! :)
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This item was shipped and delivered very quickly. I am more than pleased with it. It is a quality Item with lots of room for two cameras and lots of additional lenses and other items. I am very pleased with the quality of the item as well. I like that it is lightweight yet sturdy and adjustable to fit any size lense while keeping it securely in place and well protected. I would recommend it for others as it is a great value. I am very pleased with the customer service and deals that I get from shopping Amazon.com.
B003XYERRM|5.0|This was very thought provoking in it's view of Richard and another terribly sad story of the Plantagenants. Fascinating sources from Arab history that provided a fully developed view.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I think this game is fun but it is hard to get very far in levels. Ive only gotten to level 4 on the first stage. But it is very easy to get money. It doesn't take very long to get new stages.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I never got to see this when it first came out and since I love, love, love Downtown Abbey my husband told me that Upstairs Downstairs is even better. I definitely agree with him.
B001P8B8R0|5.0|My little son just loved it. He plays everyday at home with this one and the others we bought by amazon.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|.. because it breaks the convention of normal storytelling and takes you to another dimension where space and time are inconsequential. This is not about racing to the finish, this is about savoring the interplay in-between. Pure magic.

B00BEXB18M|4.0|From all of the flack that this album has received from various metal websites I wasn't expecting much. Having said that, I'm happy to say that I'm pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoy this album. Megadeth sound more complex, mature and confident on this album. It's not a \\"thrash\\" album but it's not a crazy departure from what they've been pumping out in the last 10 years or so. Sure there's a little more experimentation on this album - is that a bad thing? I find it refreshing that a band is willing to experiment a little, plus there's no lack of heavy riffage!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Easy to play so much fun. Everyone should give a chance I know they will love to play the game as much as I do.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Of all the BBC drama and period films and movies, Downton is by far the Best in every catagory. I only wish they'd continue producing more of it, and I wish the old man writer who dreams these things up from his bathtub would ask me for advice on another story line episode......nevertheless....Continue Downton at all costs.....the American people will surely keep supporting it with their DVD Sales. And lastly, try to merge the series now into the WWII time frame.
0765356139|5.0|Loved his work completing Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time books, so was interested in seeing what he could do on his own.  This is the secod book in a series and is is just as good as the first.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Best mini-series out of the big Island ever. Keep it going, Expand it more. Try to make more frequent....we only can get it once a year........produce it more often.
0765356147|5.0|Loved his work completing Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time books, so was interested in seeing what he could do on his own.  This is the third book in a series and is is just as good as the first.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Works as advertised and am glad I bought it. Protects the Kindle and works in both horizontal and vertical modes.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Lovable. Gimmicky. And philosophically rich are labels that can be put on any of Ferriss' work. While many other absolute beginner books focus on the utter basics, Ferriss opts to instead teach you the core basics of 4 and 5 star meals that can be applied to any meal — which makes this one of the more unique and useful beginner books out there.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone that has read a previous entry of the 4hr series. They're designed for the younger, &#34;hack my life&#34; and &#34;bang for buck&#34; audience.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|My wife and I lived in Japan for four years.  The film really shows how revered sushi is to the Japanese. Nothing better than to go to Tsukiji , the fish market in Tokyo, and have fresh sushi and sashimi.  Jiro is dedicated to the trade and the film shows this. If people like this true story they might also like Tampopo. This is a fictional story of a woman who wants to open a classic udon (noodle)<br />shop.
B008G8SFGO|2.0|Sounds more like a 80's hairband than what I am accustomed to hearing from Kiss. Would not recommend this album.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Really enjoyed reading it, was recommended by a friend. I'm hoping it's a series though....Really want to know what happens next!
B008GOAFBQ|2.0|I am a long time Kiss fan. One of my first ever records purchased was Destroyer. I expected more than this from Kiss.

1596912863|1.0|I wanted to read this book because of the upcoming Keri Russell movie, and comparison's to Bridget Jones's Diary.<br /><br />I regret this decision.<br /><br />The only thing in common between this book and Bridget Jones is that both characters like Colin Firth.<br /><br />The concept is fun and exciting: people go to a Jane Austen-themed estate (resort, or theme park, lacking better terms) and pretend to live in that era, complete with costumes and dialog. Tension arises as characters don't know if other characters are falling in love with them, or if it's just the part they're playing to fall in love.<br /><br />Austenland is a lot zanier than Bridget Jones. Yes, Bridget is kooky, but to me she's believable (at least in the first book). Austenland's daffy premise leaks over into its characters. The main character, Jane something-or-other is a dizzy idiot who will flip-flop back and forth between one man, another man, or no men, multiple times *on the same page*. In about 190 pages, the character must change her mind at least 600 times.<br /><br />The main character is the type that is all \\"woe is me, I'm unlucky in love and giving up men,\\" and we're supposed to sympathize with her. The poor victim in the game of love! However, she's also the type that will break up with a man because he snorts (that's seriously the only reason) and laugh at another man in bed. Yet when something humiliating happens to her, she wants us to feel sorry for her. Not going to happen.<br /><br />A man says to her, earnestly, in the end: You are irresistible. If he hadn't told me, I wouldn't have realized.<br /><br />I wish I had realized that this book was about someone obsessed with the movie version, not with the works on Jane Austen. As such, it feels like a movie. It's talky and flashy, but with no substance. It's a movie I don't want to see.<br /><br />I think I would have enjoyed it more if the characters had played it \\"straight\\", livening up the absurdity of it all. Also, just a smidgen of Jane Austen's with and charm would have worked wonders, as would her penchant for satire. I also would have appreciated if there weren't two token gay characters whose sexuality is used as a punchline.smidgen of Jane Austen's with and charm would have worked wonders, as would her penchant for satire.

B00D6BN9NK|1.0|It was to fictional. The theme was good, but the cast was weak. I prefer the first ones. Bruce Willis should be retired
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy having facebook on my Kindle Fire HD and is very nice when I am traveling or away from home.  As I can stay in touch, no problem.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. it is fun and exciting to play lol everyone should try it  is very very fun to play
B0055UPG22|4.0|I only bought this for workout purposes, there are several songs that have a great beat for cycling. On the downside, Pitbull has a bit too much like for profanity in his songs, so I can only take him in small doses
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It is a great game were you have to manage and build your base while fighting either on a campaign or random people online. This game deserves five stars
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is really great, but the levels are really over balanced. There is this online feature where you can attack other players which is really awesome, but even if the fight is lv. 11 vs. lv. 12, the level 12 will always win because they have ridiculously overpowered tanks not available to lv. 11 guys, turning a would-be good fight into a match more like a dinosaur vs. a little puppy.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Pandemonium is just as good as delirium! It started a bit slow for me, but picked up quickly. I can't wait to read the last book of the trilogy!
B000I9W08I|5.0|I have always enjoyed this film, great music, well written screen play and wonderful acting make this tops for an enjoyable evening.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This was a cool game and if you don't have this good game you need to get it today the stinky part of this game is there is not enough  girl skins ya so buy this game today
B000YJ85BI|4.0|I particularly enjoyed the chance to explore the characters. I usually would be disappointed in a book that didn't center on action but this one was refreshing.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|The BluRay Edition outdoes all other editions presented ... the series itself was shot and created using High Definition and u only get that in BluRay ... this BluRay edition is how the series was meant to be seen .... totally awesome sound and graphical details ... Highly Recommend the Blu-Ray edition over all others ! .. U will NOT regret it and come to luv it forever as a masterpiece of production ! .. this Edition includes the Razor and the Plan .. which is awesome as a bonus !
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, because the other reviewers generally do such a great job that I seldom feel that I have much to add. That's true now too, by the way - this \\"review\\" is really more of a commentary.  40 or so years ago, I watched Star Trek \\"TOS,\\" already in reruns, on a 12 inch black and white TV. I didn't have an easy childhood or adolescence, and it gave me a wonderful sense of escaping. I loved it, and the hokey, inexpensive special effects looked pretty scary on that little black and white TV set. Inspired perhaps by the new Star Trek films with Chris Pine, I wanted to re-watch the original series. I started with Netflix hi def, but I just had to have something even better. I bought this blu ray set, and have been watching it on my 150 inch home theater screen using a 4000 lumen projector in full 1080p resolution. I just can't believe how great they look. Everything is very vivid. Of course the hokey effects are magnified too and no longer seem so scary, but it's all in good fun. I'm very glad I made this purchase.
B000002GB9|5.0|This was My first Styx album in 1978 after this album I was hooked had to buy all the albums before & from now on!
B005DJREJS|4.0|I think the writers have created a well crafted comedy.  If you are tired of the same old slap stick style comedy shows this show is a pleasant surprise albeit not necessarily suited for younger audiences.
B000066C1N|5.0|This actually fueled my love for Bryan Adams' music on a whole. This did it all for me. He can easily match with Phil Collins in this Soundtrack and I will admit it. Just the beauty in every song, even the instrumentals! Hans Zimmer was always my second favorite Soundtrack composer right next to James Newton Howard. I was pleased with this and many Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams fans might agree.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Well acted and well written.  Very human theme.  Thought a good job was done of depicting bi polar disorder.  I was left to wonder how things would continue in their relationship, but that's outside the realm of the movie.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|my wife had a kindle which she dropped and shattered, so we upgraded to the kindle fire. she now keeps her kindle in the cover 24-7. we take it in the car ( eliminates that backseat advice ) . i have three daughters who are all professional type,s and also have kindle fire,s. so mom has a lot in common with her daug and it creates a bond that lead,s to phone call,s and conversation at gathering,s.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I myself am a runner but i dont run as much as i like to think i do. I have colapsed arches so it is very painful to run. This book gave me advice on how to correct theese things and make running an enjoyable sport again.<br />Not only was this book an amazing stoy, it had information about all kinds of lost cultures. I am a teenager so i havent gotten to experience a lot of the things with culture and different exciting opportunites but this book opened up a new door for me.  The things that i learned about in this book amused me somewhat but for the most part, i found the overwhelming flow of insight from the author's personal experience absolutdly fascinating.  This book taught me about proper ways to correct my stride while keeping me hooked in a great story.<br />If you are looking for a great book, i highly recomend it.  This book will have you hooked and sharing it with friends and family.  I hope you found my review helpful and read this great book!
B006CUDDUG|5.0|The shortest are sometimes the best . . A few weeks then its handed over to the booking machine.<br /><br />Well done, all of them. Constant gardener was a tour de force.
0743289692|5.0|Absoultely enthralled with this book/story!  Ayaans voice needs to be heard far and wide.  How courageous for her to tell it!  Love it and her!
1781162646|5.0|You know you are enjoying a book when you are about 2/3 through it and you wish you weren't so close to the end. At less than 300 pages this certainly did it for me. I am a huge Stephen King fan but other than 11/22/63 everything he has written in the last 15 years or so has been more miss than hit for me. This book was so good in my opinion, pure vintage King. You feel like you know the characters, a King trademark, and the story just speeds along. Thanks Stephen!
1892005034|5.0|This has really helped enhance my knowledge and skills in NVC. For me NVC has opened up a wonderful way to understand myself and the genesis of my emotions. In understanding this I am better able to be the person I want to be.
B007HUD6OS|3.0|First thing I want to state is John Grisham is probably my favorite author. I also was very fond of the first two Theodore Boone<br />books. But this one did't do it for me, I felt that I was constantly waiting for the excitement to draw me into the book and it just was not there. It bothers me to leave a review that is not  stellar for this author, but it is what it is.  I will still wait impatiently for<br />every thing John Grisham will write, I just hope the next is a little better.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|dvd skips and freezes in several places.  Had to load and reload to try and get it to work half way through the movie.  The raiting the seller list for this producted should have been &#34;ok, has some scratches and doesn't play all the way through.&#34;<br />Disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a walk through early hisory to teach me some of where my ancesters came. Each actor is better than the last -- if that's possible.
B000IXUOP0|5.0|One of my favorite seasons, especially the episodes regarding &#34;The Frog.&#34;  I just wish Tony and Jeanne could have stayed together.
B00D41H2PS|3.0|When I added the 5th symbol to the shield, I couldn't get them to slide.  Reset, played again, same thing.  I un/re-installed and it played just fine all the way to the end on my Kindle Fire 2nd gen.<br />It will definitely save some back-and-forthing if you take notes along the way, and it was pretty easy to tell what to take note of.  The lack of any hints will make you think a little, but intuitive play helps a lot.  There is a walkthrough now-- I checked it to make sure my glitch  was in the game and not me!<br />I really enjoyed 'Lost Town' after my panic about the shield and symbols.  I LOVE the games w/o any HO scenes, and this fit the bill perfectly for me, although it seemed very short. I recommend to  folks somewhat familiar with this genre.<br />  Only 3 stars: glitch, no hints, tap response(sometimes) and scene changes slow.
B004UID2LC|5.0|its great if u don't no how to do it shut up u guys r wrong u don't no what u r talking about
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Lovely program with a mixing interface that allows you to customize your sounds.  Timer feature is nice and will turn off app.  Overall - very satisfied.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I enjoy this app because it is fun and it is for all ages. It also brings the memo universe to life.
0765367297|5.0|This book was written within a very short time period, with limited information from the game. It's an amazing accomplishment and stands on its own.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love every part. I would recommend it to every one. I can't wait to read the next book of Percy Jackson.

B00992CF6W|5.0|great app super fun and 0.7.1 is sopost on because on apple and google its tottlely different so its time for a update now
B008WCP2PG|2.0|This movie was a waste of talent.  The previews were better than the movie.  The plot was boring and the dancing was mediocre.<br />For this to be a movie about male strippers/dancers there wasn't much to see. This is one movie I would borrow or wait until it is on cable before investing in it.
B000U6BT40|5.0|The thing about shows like Eureka is that eventually they get so busy trying to come up with new story ideas that top the last story arc in some way that they lose some or (depending on the series) a lot of the emotions the original concepts intended to evoke. The first season of Eureka holds tight to the sense of wonder an ordinary practical cop experiences when dumped into a town that must feel to him like the other side of the looking glass. At the same time the cop' practicality and down to earth realism causes Jack to feel a huge sense of frustration with the town's not always practical residents. Excellent viewing.
B00COQTZLS|3.0|I know change is hard, however, the layout is so different the V3 app is like learning a new app.<br /><br />BUG!!!  I created several events on V3 (Fire HD) with start/stop times. When sync'd PI Online then sync'd with an IPhone using PI V2 the ending times equaled the starting times in all cases.<br /><br />I have used this app for several years and really like it and I'confident the rough edges will be smoothed out.
B005BDZN62|5.0|Could not believe the 50th Anniversary Edition &#34;legacy dvd&#34; had to mention and show pictures of Obama.  Totally ruined it for me given we live in a Stasi America now.  And remember, Boston was blowback for CIA infiltrating Chechen rebels simply to cause Russia grief.  Uh oh, the NSA is probably reading this review.  Otherwise, this dvd is worth getting when on a reduced price from Amazon.  Blu-ray is super as is audio.  My favorite extra was &#34;the dances of West Side Story mode&#34; on the blu-ray movie dvd.  Does anyone else find this movie extremely homoerotic?  Never seen so much full packaging especially the character &#34;Ice&#34; played by Tucker Smith.  Pretty good for the late 50's not to mention better than what we ever see now in movies.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|A fourteen year old boy is murdered, presumably by one of his classmates.  The main suspect turns out to be the moody, antisocial son of the District Attorney who's been assigned to solve the case, and off we go to the races. A bit too heavy on the courtroom drama for me, and too many instances where Andy Barber, the father/DA, drove me absolutely crazy in his determination to ignore any evidence of his own son's guilt.  His once-happy family is nearly destroyed by the resulting trial, devastated by the psychological secrets revealed, but the real damage comes only after Andy's son is acquitted.  The ending held a surprising twist, which almost - almost - led me to give it four stars.  As it is, I'll give it 3.5.
B00AZ3KPZC|4.0|Peter Pan is a Disney classic, the kids love it and the ordering through our Kindle was super easy. Playback on all of our devices has been straightfoward and easy.

B001NLKT60|5.0|Lizabeth, need I say more?  I adore this character and can only pray that the Success of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo will convince Hollywood to make films of this and Hornet's Nest too.
B004H0M8EA|5.0|A tough but good, very good read. Meticulous research by the author, whose blend of personal experience and professional training lends credibility to his assertions and conclusions, explained much about current world events, more than you'll get on television.  Mr. Diamond always strives to be fair and balanced in his analysis of problems, offers practical solutions,never talks down to the reader, and this book is very readable.  The book provides a very good understanding of our modern environmental problems.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Another great read.  I hope he continues with this series.  I hope this one becomes a movie too.  If you saw Dragon Tattoo, all these books will be just as vivid.

B005ZOCF5E|4.0|Well imagined, flawlessly executed, this is near history precedent for the rest of Reynolds epics. It knits together our own history with the evolution of a star drive. The characters and situations are well drawn and intriguing. I enjoyed it thoroughly .
B0058ZZDVS|5.0|I started watching Suits season 1 via amazon instant video and was hooked.  I have now watched the first 5 episodes and have really only found 1 that wasn't fantastic (episode 4).  The stories are interesting and have a nice twist at the end.  I compare it to \\"House\\" but with Law instead of medicine.  My co-worker is even contemplating buying the series.  I have amazon prime so it's free to me, but he thinks it's worth the money.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I am glad I do not need to write about the plot of the book, as the spoiler police are on alert!  However, it is my opinion that no spoiler could ruin this book, because the narrative voice is the book.  Like another surprising delight, Where'd You Go, Bernadette, the plot is a vehicle and the driver is the wonderfully crafted phrasing, the \\"how\\" of the story, not the why.  Not to say the story is not engaging.  But even when certain sections did not appeal to me (the drugged pub crawl and descriptions of product testing on animals), I stuck with Rosie because she was so self-effacing, so quirky but in a relatable way, so intellectual (read this on Kindle...you will want to get the definition of several words) while professing to be lost, so sure in her voice, which against all odds is upbeat!.  The reader learns so much about Rosie simply from listening to her.  There are so many layers to this book, while it seems a breeze to read.  There are so many wonderful lines, some cliches which ground the family, others part of Rosie's narrative.  Her alienation as a little girl, attributed to her identity as ******-girl (no spoilers), struck such a chord, at the same time she related so many intimate, happy times too.  What I am trying to say is the book is loaded with touchstones, and one will definitely appeal, whether it is the reference to children's books or philosophy or literature or the beautifully wrought descriptions of nature, or the descriptions of childhood activities, like climbing trees, sliding down staircases...It is difficult to recommend this book to everyone because the very things that make it sing may not appeal to all.  There are some uncomfortable truths, but the journey is well worth it!  If you love animals, it will be painful at times but the telling will truly grab your heart.
159463176X|5.0|Like his previous two novels, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, exquisitely written. A tragic, yet moving family saga. Well done.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I am only halfway through this book and I am loving it! It is laugh-out-loud funny at times. Told entirely from the man's point-of-view, it lets us see inside the (fictional) minds of all those horn dogs. LOVE this book (so far!).
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love swiftkey, I have used it for 3 years now and would never go back to using anything else.  I love it so much I bought the tablet version as well!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed The Kite Runner very much.  Although well written, this book did not engage me as much. The story focuses on a young Afghan girl whose close attachment to her brother is severed when she was given to a wealthy childless family.  Taken to France still as a child she is raised there by her adopted mother.  We follow her and her father and brother in the background of the wars and politics of Afghanistan.  Because at times I put the book down for a day or two, I found it difficult to follow - forgetting who some of the characters were.  I would recommend this book.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Everything about the novel is superior - the characters are rightfully highly praised as well as the plot involving the development of the youngest son. The Godfather is a wonderful character.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was by far the best most challenging game I have played in a very long time.  I hope there are more like it to come

B002T9H2LA|5.0|PROS:<br /><br />This is definitely a must see original movie that rewrites WWII.<br /><br />It's also very artsy in that it's presented in chapters.<br /><br />Great actors and directing.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Violent, so I would only recommend to adults.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz (plays the NAZI) are really good.  Christoph Waltz is also in an excellent newer movie \\"DJango Unchained\\" with Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio.
B0094MFITS|5.0|I had heard about this character and Selleck's portrayal of same, but did not know that CBS was producing something worth watching. Tom Selleck's performance is very smooth and easy to appreciate. I'm interested in watching all of them. Heard they just ended the production of these shows, which makes sense since networks are not really interested in this kind of content. Now a cable channel can pick it up and make some money with it and another several thousand people can stop watching CBS.
B00005JMYI|5.0|I don't know how it took me this long to see this movie! It was hilarious! Will Ferrell is one of my favorite comedians. I can't wait for part 2
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|First the picture quality was bad and the movie itself was stupid! So glad I didn't buy it! $3.99 worth of movie on all accts! Wish it would've been .99 cents!

B009MO57H6|4.0|Have seen all of the Resident Evil and this one is just not as good as the previous ones! If you don't pay close attention from beginning to end you will be completely lost. Other than that really good movie!
B00B23O96A|2.0|I bought the album because I loved the \\"Our Love Is Here to Stay\\" number.  The rest of the album was disappointing.  Rod Stewart and Willie Nelson do a much better job with the old classics.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|As with the previous 2 this one is great! If only they would make another one! A must see to the Transformers franchise!
B009MYARIK|5.0|Love it! Fun and charming! Sophie Kinsella has created another fantastic literary romantic comedy. This is an easy summer read-- best read by the pool with a fruity cocktail in hand.

B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|I enjoyed the read.  The suspense was not too prevalent until the end, but I was sucked in from the very beginning.  Typical Lee Child book.  Always getting me addicted until the end.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|impossible to put down. incredible  human being[ even though he comitted adultrey]  what  he did in his lifetime will flabbergast you.  how  he became  leading man, how he learned how to be comedic from milton bearle, his friendships with presidents, simon wiesenthal,warren buffet.  his  boundless energy  to help  disadvantaged children. he tried his hardest in california  to get  state  unions  to give concessions on there insane  guaranteed  benefits programs. he failed  but  every  state is going to have to face the same reality sooner or latter.the result in california  was to cut tons of programs to get  fiscally  responsible again.  just  like  every state will have to do sooner or latter. his vision of america  is realistic and accurate.  he's  a visionary. his  bringing up in austria  is in itself an amazing  story . to come to america and have the vision to buy real estate and go to college ,and body build, and start a construction co, start a mail order business, and of course to become a leading man in movies.
B00797MB0O|3.0|thought this was going to be funny, some points were but mostly not- at least it wasn't a waste of my time watching.
B000W1YYRC|5.0|I really enjoy Sigur Ros. This is the second album I bought & I'm planning on buying more albums. The music relaxes me after a stressful day. I recommend anyone who hasn't checked them out to do so.
159463176X|3.0|I am a huge fan of Khaled Hosseini's other two books and couldn't wait to read his third. Unfortunately, I feel that this novel fell short. The story line was not as compelling as the others, too many characters, too many side stories, but not enough depth.

030745455X|5.0|This is a good series of books to read.  It's a page turner, had most of it read on the plane, and quickly finished up on the beach in Jamaica.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|Maybe to use for looking up items, but I sell on ebay and found it hard to navigate. Will use my computer for ebay, am comfortable there. Touch screen is too touchy. . . . :)

B0087ITBPC|5.0|I give it five stars as you really have to watch to the end bit slow but has it good points anyone would enjoy this
B00908DDZM|5.0|After individually buying multiple songs, I broke down and bought the entire album. Totally worth it. Tons of great songs, including ones that aren't getting airplay.<br /><br />Side note: the actual album was cheaper than the MP3 album, and comes with a free download.

B003L77GRO|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone over the age of 18 years it is not suitable for young children it is very graphic
B000I8COBW|5.0|This is one of the best of the Evil Dead series, any fan of Bruce Campbell will love watching this over and over, we are now  second generational followers of the Evil Dead series. I grew up with the first, my kids grew up the second generation and I have a feeling there will be a third to follow us. Black comedy genius Sam Rami and Bruce Campbell know what we like! ....<br /><br />I will add this; the new release of Evil Dead 2 is packed with little quips only a true dead fan would recognize so if you love these like we do, be sure to see the new one..
B004AKCME8|5.0|I would recommend this as a family movie the kids will love it, it is a great story and characters
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with the app, it did everything it said and is great for what I added it for, study time. I can plug in and tune out while I work my equations or read. I use the soothing water sounds to help me relax and stay focused. I do recommend this to everyone not just for sleeping but for disconnecting from the busy digital world, it was very nice to hear the sounds I had long forgotten.
B004GJYROG|5.0|One for the family great to watch good story the kids with love the toons as well as michael jordon

B00CX7OX6U|5.0|\\"To the Wonder\\" (À la merveille) is an extraordinary film that must be taken in full on its own terms.  It is tempting for those who know much (or even a little) about Malick to focus on some of his familiar techniques and devices, make comparisons with earlier films, and ponder what it is he is trying to say this time (especially coming after \\"The Tree of Life\\").  It also is tempting for all kinds of viewers to puzzle over the scarcity of dialogue and the paring of the scenes in the drama.  Yes, this movie demands attention, of all kinds, and, of course, if one wants to study and critique it after multiple viewings, then by all means, do so.  But I fear that those who might begin by holding the film at arm's length, puzzling, judging, or simply waiting for explanations, may end up missing the wonder it really is.<br /><br />My advice, therefore, is take it all in, give yourself over to this film, and do not get distracted by what might ordinarily strike you as missing plot details.  Drink in every bit of the screen shots you can, let the music wrap around you, and imprint the few words you see and hear on your forehead (not unlike what Tatinia does in the movie) so you'll remember them later.<br /><br />I know that this is not necessarily how many will approach a film by a director like Malick.  I probably would have viewed it differently myself if I had not stumbled upon it by accident, after having been somewhat disenchanted with \\"The Tree of Life.\\"  I just happened to find \\"To the Wonder\\" on cable PPV one day after returning from a trip to France, which just happened to include a day's drive to see Le Mont St. Michel (\\"La Merveille,\\" as it is known in France) and was curious about what Malick had done with it.<br /><br />Somewhat to my surprise, my first viewing of the film left me breathless. I was immediately drawn into the sights and sounds of each scene and driven by the director's extraordinary way of melding cinematography, music, characters, emotion, andsetting into a single vision.  Yes, I missed a few details from the script (hard to see the subtitles or absorb the spoken words, especially on a small screen) the first time, and I have absorbed more and more with each viewing (several more at home and one at a movie theater).  But it was not as though it was difficult or inaccessible the first time.  It worked, I think, because I let the direction make the coherency for me from the beginning.<br /><br />I realize that others may have different experiences and opinions, but I would urge anyone who may be inclined to see this film to try it first by plunging in, by seeing France and Oklahoma and the characters from the inside, and letting it all sink in, reach your heart and mind and all your senses.  There is an honesty and freshness to all that is portrayed  -- the pain, the sorrow, the beauty, the wonder, the poverty and despair -- which makes whatever transcendence comes through as if in real time, place, and memory, rather than superimposed.  And while there may be all kinds of prices to be paid in making films like this, at least this time I think Malick came as close as anyone can to making it all work beautifully together, paring film down to its barest essentials, yet creating a wondrous feast in the end. I cannot recall a film that has moved me so much (with the possible exception of Kalatozov's \\"Letter Never Sent\\").<br /><br />A few words about the Christian elements in the movie.  As Michael Carroll pointed out in his Amazon review, Malick's films are first and foremost experience.  Part of the experience conveyed by \\"To the Wonder\\" are the words and actions that are a call to God:  Marina's experiences at mass and confession, Jane's reflections on what she is told the Bible says about the loss of her child; Marina and Neil's marriage (a Protestant ceremony, as we know Marina must be denied the sacramental rite because of her prior marriage and divorce); Neil's occasional attendance at mass, his spokenrejection of Jane's request to pray with him; and, of course, the actions, sermons, and thoughts of the priest -- just to name a few.  None of these calls are met with direct, or arguably, even indirect answers, and all are part of a larger whole that conveys remembered experience of people, places, and things through images and sounds.<br /><br />The film is, indeed, a deeply personal and deeply Christian view of life, love, pain, sorrow, regret, and joy.  But it is not a sermon, and it is not necessary to subscribe to Christianity or any other faith in particular to take part in the experience.  Anyone who has experienced the slings and arrows of romantic love (and regretfully taken arms against its troubles), struggled with the demands of commitment, and doubted one's ability to make and sustain family and/or partnership, will know the pain, the guilt, and the possibilities for forgiveness and redemption, of one sort or another.  Malick does indicate that there is something \\"missing\\" if we do not finally connect with others and the world around us, if we do not try our best to love and care for people and the natural world we live in.  But he's not preaching this -- he's showing us the slow, painful, and often confusing experience of learning it bit by bit.<br /><br />While some may find the final scenes (and the denouement that precedes them) bewildering, or at best, susceptible of multiple interpretations, I do not think that it is meant to be inconclusive in the way we might expect a \\"serious\\" film to be.  Nor do I think it reflects sloppiness on the part of Malick trying to wrap up a film created in what appears (at least to the actors and outsiders) an ad hoc fashion.  There is redemption, but not the kind that progresses towards a concluding epiphany.  It comes instead from remembered experience and a sacramental vision of all of life, which puts brushing one's teeth, putting socks on, quarreling, lovemaking, fishing in a lake, kissing the buds on a tree, dancing, swimming, sampling for tar sand, struggling with drug addiction, poverty, and pollution, all on par with the rites of Holy Communion, confession, and matrimony.<br /><br />The film tests us all, sees if we are willing to touch and feel the sunlight warming the stained glass window and walk with and among, the poor and the elderly, as well as the main characters.  We can choose to hide in our homes, behind our windows, with the world outside knocking to get in, or we can see, hear, and feel what is wondrous, as well as painful, frightening, and confusing.  \\"Christ be with me. Christ before me. Christ behind me. Christ in me. Christ beneath me. Christ above me. Christ on my right. Christ on my left. Christ in the heart.\\"  This is not a call to faith but a deep expression of what the experience of faith is.  Whether one understands or shares such an experience in Christian terms, it is still a wonder to not just behold but to live for a time.<br /><br />I can hardly wait for this film to come out on DVD in August.  I see it is still playing in selected theaters through July.  I would strongly urge anyone who wants to seriously give this film a chance to see it, at least first, on as large a screen as possible.  This is NOT a film for IPad or laptop viewing.  And thank you Amazon for already making the soundtrack available -- it is hauntingly beautiful.
159463176X|4.0|So far a fascinated read!  More when I finish it. His characters come alive on the pages, captivating our imagination and making it nery difficult to put down ,
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Excellent music, great story and I really want Dave Grohl to be my uncle.<br /><br />FRESH POTS!! FRESH POTS!<br /><br />Seriously buy it and thank me later.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Daft Punk is amazing! I don't own any of their older albums (I should) and I mainly know their popular songs from what Pandora Radio plays. So from a lay perspective, this is a great album. If you're not a music snob you will probably will enjoy it and ignore all the reviews saying otherwise.
B006O7XOOW|1.0|The balls roll out to the floor, not the legs. The toy takes up WAY too much space and does not fold down in anyway. Neither my 1yr old (who received it as a gift) or my 5yr old are impressed. I am forever chasing balls under couches and tables for my toddler to have approximately 10 seconds of entertainment? Pass on this, buy an old school ball popper then the balls would reload on there own and take up a reasonable amount of space.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have a fancy radio alarm, but once I got my kindle fire and downloaded this app, I've not used it since! The creshendo (sp?) is the best feature and it's super easy to use. I forget about my alarm because I can program my days. I also, with minimal use of my kindle, get literally over a month out of my battery! Super happy with this app, and I highly recommend it!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I first saw this show on TV when it had com out but never had a chanceto get into it but recently bought it and I can't seem to get enough of it. I highly recommend if you like superhero comics and movies.
B002I8PVQA|5.0|While theres no academy award winning acting here it's still a very well done and you can;t take your eyes off it. I watch this about once a year, the ins and outs of the &#34;big&#34; score are fascinating to watch....get it and go!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|They have gotten tons of problems fixed. It is way easier to build stuff, and they have gotten the glitches mostly fixed is way awesome.
B008602KQI|5.0|Very good with profoundness.<br />The best part was that she did what you could without fuss.<br />So did he make to the end without making heroic action out of his capability of throwing a heavy thing.<br />and at last, was good that she had to go back to her norm in ralationship with her boyfriend whereas he clearly mentioned, \\"i don't wanna forget!\\"
B002M5E2DW|5.0|If you want to work, you need to allow yourself to be an optimist and be decisive.  It will work!<br /><br />If you open your eyes, you can see that this happens all day long to many people.<br /><br />If you are a pessimist.  Ask the universe to help you become an optimist first then you'll be able to see what is possible.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|I wanted to catch up with Jones and simply fustrated.<br />Had such a feeling as money has been wasted in vain.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the best sequel ever. It is more than I imagined and much more than I ever could have hoped for. The whole time I thought Katniss and Gale would get together, but in the end, her and Peeta get back together and Gale goes to District 2. I think the epilogue is especially sweet with the song and her description of Katniss and Peeta's children.
B008Y73940|4.0|I always love to see Matthew McConaughey.  He'a a little scummy but has good characters around him..not really a scummy guy after all.  The plot twists are very interesting and like to hate Ryan Phillippe.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|Thanks to the author for a great and inspiring experience in reading.l can not wait to read her other books in this series.
B004EF8AJA|5.0|Elizabeth Gaskell is as good as Jane Austen any day - and this mini-series of her work doesn't disappoint!  In addition to a love story that you won't forget, there's the forefront of the cotton industry and labor problems of England in the mid 1800s to contend with.  The dark feeling of the story is a world with gray skies, gray buildings, and smog, it's a portrait of the haves and have nots, the masters vs. the workers, and misunderstandings.  Yet, the last five minutes of the mini-series will make your heart sing and become a favorite with the staying power of Pride and Prejudice!  I can't recommend it more highly.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have not finished this yet but so far it is very entertaining and well written. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to peek into the future.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|At last I got to see this amazing band and I thoroughly enjoyed this concert! Can't say much more than what the other reviewers have said.  A real must have for Supertramp fans so get it while you can.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|This version of Snow White focuses on her relationship with the huntsman of legends, presenting a more active Snow White. The tale focuses on themes of people who will not let go of their youth and power at the expenses of others or perhaps the lengths one will go to preserve their looks. Is this a subtle attack on plastic surgery?<br /><br />The images, cinematography and music are very good or better. The story, like many Hollywood films, is a few notches down and the characters and dialogue are in between the two previous mentioned elements. Charlize Theron, who plays the evil queen, does an exemplary job in presenting herself as a viable antagonist who is more than a villain in black. Kristin Stewart (best known as Bella from the controversial TWILIGHT series) plays a Messiah like Snow White, Chris Hemsworth plays an adequate Huntsman from the fairy tales and a couple of the dwarves are notable actors, too (Ian McShane and Ray Winstone).<br /><br />For those familiar with the Snow White legends (and if you're not where have you been?) this takes a non-Disney approach trying to make this accessible for adults especially and to a lesser extent children. I don't see much of a reason to cover the story as it's well known and all the websites are already doing it.<br /><br />The budget for this film was $170M and it made over $396M at the Box Office. Based on the famous fairy tale, \\"Snow White\\", by Brothers Grimm. A sequel was planned but got delayed when the director (who was married) slept with Stewart and got caught.<br /><br />This picture was nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Costume Design.<br /><br />Why the hate from some reviewers? They don't like change and are expecting Shakespeare.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY/VISUAL EFFECTS: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; SOUND/MUSIC: B plus; FAIRY TALE FOCUSES/FRESHNESS EVEN IF USING THE SNOW WHITE STANDARDS: B;<br />ACTION SCENES: B plus to Aminus; WHEN WATCHED: mid June 2013; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.
B007U1FEQW|5.0|I saw the Beach Boys in concert in Sydney, Australia last year and they just blew me away.  This album is just brilliant. I purchased it on vinyl and so glad that I did.. It's the Beach Boys 2012!
B0097HC8MK|5.0|This is a thoroughly entertaining flic that I think I've seen more than a dozen times.  The direction and editing add immensely to the production.  It seems to me that Nicolas Cage never catches a bad role.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|the book is much deeper than you expect an action book to be. glad that such reading is available for young readers.
B007N85POS|1.0|Force closed on me before letting me play on my kindle fire hd. Uninstalled and haven't tried again. Full version of bad pigs does the same thing.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|some portions of the book are very interesting. Facts are a bit more repetitive than i would like them to see. Liked the Outliers much better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game it is great!! You get to play ride you're own hoarse you're style! I love this app!
B002R5QPRI|3.0|Still a good movie, with a bit too much romance, but the singing and music are beautiful. Nice to watch again.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I'm midway through my second listen.  I like it better this time around.  Sure, it borrows riffs from the glory years.  Hey, if you invented it, you can borrow from it.  I like it.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Classic, but terrible story. Regret that i watched it with my 12 y.o. daughter. Liked the musical part, but did not appreciate the movie part. The voices are awesome. The music is beautiful. But the movie is terrible to watch.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really liked this book.  I have not seen the movie so had no idea what the story was. It was well written, easy to read. (I'm not the fastest reader but was still a quick read) Almost brought tears to my eyes at times.  Thank you.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|As a movie, Hollywood did a great injustice to this heart wrenching story of a battle to conquer mental illness and loneliness.  People who saw the movie viewed an incomplete version of a must read tale. I was unable to put it down!
0375842209|5.0|I can't remember reading a book as captivating as this one by Markus Zusak. I read it for the first time borrowed from my local public library, then wanted to have a personal copy to re-read and loan to friends. It's that intriguing. My sister who loves to read in Shreveport, LA told me about it. i talked about it to friends in Haverhill,MA. We read it and it is now on the recommended summer reading list for students at Haverhill High School.  So much the better!<br />I bought a used paperback edition, it was perfect for my needs.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|It was an easy read and quite enjoyable.  Great lesson at the end of the book that everyone should follow
0679805273|5.0|Dr. Seuss writes for children of all ages and as an adult I read it for the first time when I saw it in the classroom of a former student who is now a teacher of English for Seniors in high school.  I loved it! I recently gave a copy to another student, a Japanese woman who also was a former student. She has found wisdom and joy in receiving it.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The book was slow moving and I couldn't relate as well to the characters in this book. At times, it was difficult to follow if I had to interrupt my reading.

0307959856|5.0|This book was in pristine condition, and arrived well packaged and fast. It was a worthy sequel to Pride and Prejudice. I hope this author will give us more. I will purchase from this vendor again.
B001EC3JME|5.0|works fine for my use holds some of the bigger body flashlights just fine  great thank you i would recomend this product
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I am enjoying this soundtrack very much. I decided to purchase it after I first saw the movie, which I subsequently also purchased.<br />It is a CD that will appeal to many tastes, with it's selection of Maroon 5's Sweetest goodbye, to Wyclef Jean's Take me as I am to the Beach Boys God only knows. There is also Joni Mitchell, Texas and Norah Jones to enjoy. Worth the money any time.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel played a drunk pilot great and believable john goodman was great as his coke supplier. Very much worth watching'
0802473156|4.0|The book arrived in excellent condition, well packaged, and within the time promised. There were many interest and thought provoking items in here. Some helped some didn't. On the whole I think it is a worthy helper for those of us seeking answers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is super fun its not very easy but its not hard either I totally recomend this app/game its SUPER FUNNNNNN!!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Sorry I'm so behind with my reviews. the movie arrived in perfect condition, with in the time promised and proper packaging.<br />Of course the screen writers''  took literary license with the wonderful books and changed important things. But with all belly aching apart, it was well put together film and kept every entertained.
0425263924|4.0|I was skeptical when I received the book because I'd seen some negative reviews. I loved it! Granted, there were parts I didn't care about, not necessarily bad I just don't care about Megumi's love life or Will's no carb diet. The thing that makes this series great was still there in spades ...... Gideon and Eva's smoking hot, deep love for each other. The &#34;surprise&#34; in that occurs on their destination weekend...perfect! I loved the way it occurred, loved the plane ride over, all of it. The thing that makes me love this series is the deep and sometimes tortured love that Gideon and Eva have for each other and that love deepens and changes into a much more secure love in this book.<br /><br />There were things that I don't understand being in the book, like the whole Megumi and Lacey thing. I suppose you need something for the secondary characters to do, but I could have done without it. Having said that, I don't trust Will. There's just something a little &#34;off&#34; there....we'll see. Maybe that's why Megumi's been MIA for a few days, maybe she saw Will doing something possibly around Eva's desk???? IDK maybe not.<br /><br />Some reviewers didn't get the Russian Mob thing. I do. I thought it was a great angle, and I'm sure it will add some action to the next book.<br /><br />I don't want to say so much that I'm giving spoilers, but I wasn't thrilled with the ending. While I loved the book, the ending was very lackluster and sort of left me hanging in a yawn kind of way. That was the only thing that kept me from giving it five stars.<br /><br />Will I buy the next book in the series? You bet. I'm addicted to Gideon and Eva and I've got to see them get their happily ever after. If that takes one more book or two, I'm there. Go on now, buy it, read it, review it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Wow, the tables have turned the lines have been drawn. Everything has changed. Where will they go from here? I don't know but I am truly enjoying the ride!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|You get pulled into this story right away. It is a short book, but very good story. Highly recommend this.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the last book in the trilogy and am sad to se it end  Although I bit muddled and hard to follow near the end, I thought it was a fitting end. I only wish I hadn't seen the Hunger Games movie as I kept picturing the actors in their respective roles. The exception to this was picturing Donald Sutherland as the evil leader of the capital. That made it better!
B0090KZDSK|1.0|Totally disappointed in the slow plot. What about Gideon's mum, she barely gets a mention. C'mon Sylvia day, you had 6 months to write this. I'm not paying $10 for this. If it goes to 5 books, would anyone consider paying $50?
0307477479|4.0|Ummmm, kinda hard to describe, certainly an impressive work of writing. Based on the reviews it seem people either loved it or hated it. Most of the hate comes from the critical acclaim and the fact that it's not the most \\"enjoyable\\" read. Is it the most entertaining read? No. Is it an easy read? considering the amount of characters, changes in time, place and point of view, absolutely not. Does Egan accomplish communicating her themes through a complicated work of creative writing? Yes. Is it worthy of all the awards? Probably, I get it. Overall I recommend it, but it's not for everyone.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I read a lot of John Grishams first books and always liked them a lot. But then life got busier with family, pets, work, and home and I didn't have the free time that I used to have for reading. A friend had recently recommended Calico Joe which was a fast easy read, so I thought I would check out more of Grishams newer work and loved all of the twists and turns that The Racketeer kept taking.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|From the first eposide up to the end of the Eighth season, this show never fails to impress and always impresses me.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|What can I say but silmpy the best! If you realy what to here the true nature of this CD you have to listen on a good tube amp!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I was compelled to purchase this video because my granddaughter loves it.  It was a surprise gift that was well received.
B00834FP5A|5.0|A wonderful product, great for collectors, NEETs and Monster Hunter fans alike. The figuring is highly mobile, well sculpted, and comes with many accessories. The stand, however, is woefully inadequate in respect to the figurine's weight, a paperweight is need to keep the Rathalos from toppling over in some more exotic poses. Shipping took forever and a day, while irritating, it's to be expected from import items.
B007JWKLMO|4.0|Another reason to enjoy George Harrison! It is a nice addition to any musical library.  Go ahead land buy this one.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Very comfortable, causal watch. Simple, yet reliable. The watchband is not the best material, but that can be easily replaced.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone as a beginner automatic watch.
B0098VXMNE|3.0|Probably would've been better in HD version but it costs almost twice as much so we didn't buy the HD. Amazon shouldn't charge so much more for HD.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|More than adequate for my needs. The feature of tapping into weather reports anywhere is great. It seems to be fairly accurate and very convenient to use with the various info options.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is the most useful thing on my kindle fire. I love having my notes sync from all my gadgets and my browser.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent reading.  Fascinating novel with a very human touch.  Every character in the book is extraordinary. Highly recommended for everyone who has a soul.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Waited a long time for his next book. I only hope it doesn't take years for the next one. Fabulous story!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and I play it every day after school school. Wonder if they can make a game better than Miami
B000AY74OG|5.0|Pretty much the same quote I had for Mad 2. It just keep you entertained. Like I said family time. thanks
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great series that keeps your attention.  Very entertaining and makes you think as you try to keep up with the concepts.
B004XVMCPI|5.0|Now this I can deal with and keeps me entertained, but then again Chow is one of my favorite actors. thanks
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Historically accurate portrayal of Vikings in their foundation of being known for the great raiders and warriors we've read and found them to be...Well Done and Greatly Enjoyable- Travis Fimmel, Kathryn Winnick, & Clive Standen really make this cake bake, and with Gabriel Byrne making almost a full seasons worth of cameos, this is a series history buffs shouldn't miss!!!
B001TCHDPS|4.0|i didn't like these songs as well as his cold fact album but it is nice to have the words to all the songs,and it is still his honest, simple, almost haunting voice telling his stories.
B00631HASU|4.0|Lots to this game for the price. Good music.beautiful graphics and challenging levels keeps one striving to beat the game.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|we saw the documentary on rodriguez and got this album right away. it is really incredible. i listen to it all the time. my favorite.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This movie is awesomely done! Adam Sandler has out done himself. The voice over cast is perfect and the animation is outstanding. It's a whole new twist on a coming of age, love story. Bravo!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm really hooked on this show!  I've watched seasons 1 and 2 but will wait until I can watch season 3 for free.  I think it sucks that Amazon took it over from Hulu Plus, probably so they can charge for it, which I don't like.  But I'm hoping as Season 4 approaches, Jan of 2013, that season 3 will become free for us Prime users.
B0024CEY36|5.0|True to Follett's reputation of a great story teller.  This novel held my interest and i learned a lot about Russians during the war.  I think i will read all Follett's books
B0027MJU00|5.0|Awesome book! Similar to her others but still a good page turner! Highly recommend to those that like a good murder mystery.
0425263991|5.0|~~~~~ Spoiler Alert~~~~~<br /><br />All the clues where in the other books and rereading them lead me to the conclusion of who the ghost was and it was PERFECT how it came out in the story. They weaved a story and I really enjoyed. I can't wait for the next one and will be sad to see it end. The interaction between Kaleb Krychek and Sahara Kyriakus was perfect. He waited for Sahara to come to him after the rescue. You will not be disappointed.
B0063M22QO|2.0|I ran through this version in about 20 minutes.  Waste of time.  Just go to Version II and start there.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|This is a smart, hip, slickly written serial killer thriller. An intense story that grabs you by the throat from the opening sentence and doesn't let go. This should appeal to fans of 'American Psycho' and dark stories in general. The author has a talent for dialogue. All the characters are well-drawn. The book is dark and intense but also sophisticated and disturbing. Guaranteed to get under your skin.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever also get the pocket edition editor you can edit Your stuff and spawn mobs so cool if you hate this game you have very bad taste all you people think its a lot of money witch it is but you are buying it for a good cost you will get adictid and the added new stuff to it you can eat cake and eat eggs and spawn animals :)
B001VTTRC6|4.0|Terrific development of characters; intricate weave of story lines culminating in suspenseful ending.  Great whodunit; pay attention to little clues throughout movie.
B00A3OT34M|5.0|This is just a super album.  I really like the songs and I especially like the songs where he teamed up with other artists.  His choices were great.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It's okay...but after his first two books it was disappointing.  It did not live up to my expectations.  It was a good story but it jumped around and back and forth more than I liked.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I would not recommend starting this book!  I am going to see it to the end though..I am 50% done.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It did not hold my interest like his two previous books did. Disjointed.  I actually skipped to the end which is not a good sign.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Love books that I can't put down. This book is intriguing from the first to the last page. A must read.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Great music and singers.  Tells story through  the songs.  Touching, sad, sentimental and made me cry.  Loved every word. Played a thousand times.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|i love all her books and this one was just as wonderful. i look foward to reading all her books.
1401937519|5.0|this is one of the most interesting books I have ever read.I am truly sorry that Anita had to suffer but anyone, no everyone will be spiritually moved by her story.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that it's light weight and you have all kind of books at your fingertips.  I also found that it helped my kids with reading, they enjoyed using the device and took advantage of the definition feature.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love how you can buy and upgrade all of Tony's suits of armor from operation house party. This Game is Awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Although admittedly slow in the beginning, the way each story pieced and then connected together was consuming. The two main characters are beautifully established, leaving the reader no choice but to relate to and champion for them both. Above all, the historical events and references weaved throughout the book may force us westerners to take a realistic look at someplace other than our homes. Eye opening, compelling, heart breaking- I loved this book.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am currently addicted! I haven't been able to read anything else since starting the first book. My son is watching the series on HBO and I'm having a difficult time NOT discussing plot turns or giving away surprises. The format is both maddening and an excellent technique for keeping the reader on top of the characters' contributions to the saga.  I also find the writing to be intelligent, fluent, and descriptive. Can't wait to see what happens next.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It's a really, really great app which I enjoy using very very much! I find that it really helps me so very much when it comes to sleeping.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Was a good read.  I am a huge fan of Mr. Hosseini's books and was delighted when this one was released.  True to his writing style.  Was upset though with the not so happy ending, albeit realistic!!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Long time Sabbath fan...I am 45 and got the Deluxe package...If you are a Black Sabbath fan you are going to love this ....Period !!!  It's like if Led Zeppelin made a new cd, right off the bat you would say .....DAMN....that is Led Zeppelin !!<br />This is Sabbath firing an all cylinders, Great Jams, killer lyrics......Killer Rock !!  Period.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Nothing much to say....Present day Megadeth, same as last two releases.  It's good, no complaints here.  I alway's hope for a \\"Killing is my...\\" type of release but I don't think it will happen, they are on the same path as Metallica making OK records.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great fun to watch this family and how they react to the changing times.  The number of sub-plots is wonderful and keeps us closely tuned in.  Special features are also helpful.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|It is great to have so many games to play.  I like that each game doesn't go on forever.  The tiles are beautiful, I love the game.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I did not know how to make it work. It was too small for me to read. I'm sure the problem was me and not the app.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great escape until you feel the reality at the end or should I say the new beginning . More of a reality than I expected. Loved it can't wait to read it again as to see what I missed
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like this app alot. Thanks for offering this really great app. I really like it and use every single day!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have a lot of fun with this app on my ipod, and I think it's an entertaining game. I recommend it for pretty much anyone who likes animal care games.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|What else can I say?! It's an Angry Birds game & aren't they all cool in their way?! It's sad, but true......the world is addicted to Angry Birds!! =)
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I've read all the books in this series. I know personally I read the reviews of readers before I purchase a book and the prior reviews did not disappoint and said it all but didn't say enough. This by far is the best in the series I absolutely loved this book. I have no words of my own that would do justice to the beauty of this story. It hit all my emotions Kaleb and Sahara broke my heart and made me smile and sigh. Loved Loved Loved this story. If you haven't read any of the prior books you need to start at the beginning, this series is a keeper and one I've read more than once. Thank you so much for this beautiful story.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I bought the e-book expecting the author to kill somebody again but didn't realize that i will be shock on how it ends. I find it interesting.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I'm very disappointed in this app. I bought it now it wont download?! $7 for nothing. But in general I love minecraft so I'm sure if.it actually DOWNLOADED it would be enjoyable
B00C2VIA52|3.0|Well I've been playing it for a couple of days I can say it's fun but very annoying. I am not going to spend Really money on this game. By not spending real money I do not have access to good cards this is bad<br /><br />6/10.Jesse~
B00000HZH7|5.0|This album is a must have for anyone who considers themselves a death metal fan. This is a true example of &#34;proto-death metal&#34; the kind of stuff that Chuck Schuldiner & Co. drew from to really kick start the genre.
193700788X|3.0|Here I am posting my first review of a product at Amazon, and it really isn't even a review.<br /><br />Okay, so I wanted to buy Dead Ever After as a surprise for my niece.  I know she's been holding off buying it herself because she keeps mentioning it as a wish list item for her upcoming birthday.  However, I want to be persuaded that my niece will love this book or I'll be giving her something else instead.  I don't want to be the one to give her a gift and find that she is ultimately disappointed by it.  Call it my quirk!<br /><br />Anyway, I don't know much about the series.  That's why I came here; Amazon always has lots of product reviews.  Those reviews have helped me tremendously in the past.<br /><br />This book has earned three stars, which of course is an average.  So I sought out the \\"most helpful\\" reviews, as I always do for any product.  I found page after page after page of lengthy 1-star substantive reviews critical of the book.  While I found some of these reviews a bit harsh at times, most of them were well-reasoned.  As a non-reader of the series, most of the time, I could generally follow what all their points were.<br /><br />I then tried to find the substantive positive reviews, in my quest to find some balance (and an explanation for the 3-star average, when so many of the most helpful reviews are one stars).  I clicked on the 5 stars to start my search, and to my great surprise, I found mostly one or two sentence reviews with no substance provided.  Some of the reviewers don't seem to know any more about Dead Ever After than I do!  I was so amazed by this discovery that I decided to count up all the vague one or two sentence 5-star reviews, page after page.<br /><br />What did I find?  Out of a total of 671 5-star reviews, I found approximately 70 lengthy substantive reviews, and about 600 of the single or two-sentence fluffy variety.  Here are some examples of the latter:<br /><br />* Wish there was still more to come.. Very interesting howdifferent from Ture blood the novels are and very glad too..<br />* Always wanted Sookie to be happy glad it happened. All the characters were tied up nice and neat in a bow.<br />* I love this new book in the series, and this one was so amazing. I am excitedly waiting on the new<br />* Hate this is the last book really going to miss her but i can say she went out with a bang  one to come out.<br />* I have loved the series since the very beginning. I could not stand the HBO series-just could not watch it. So sorry the end had to come- so now I'm buying them for my kindle, instead of hard copies.<br />* I felt like this was the end, but I was waiting for Sookie to find true love and enjoyed this book. Would have like a little more vamp though.<br />* Ended beautifully. I didn't think she could pull it off in a way that didn't annoy me but she did. Wonderful easy read!<br />* I really liked the book and I am so sad it is the last one of this series, but I think it was time to end the series.<br />* It was awesome I couldn't put it down, the suspense to get to the next page kept me going until it was done after 3 days of reading so good I can't wait for the final book to come in November!<br />* I had to have this book. I had read all the previous one's and watched all the True Bloods. Charlene did not let me down.<br />* Had a few twists and turns that I did not expect. However, I am always a fan. Loved the book. Looking forward to what happens to Sookie in the next one.<br />* The ending was not what I expected but it I can understand why it ended this way. I would highly recommend this book expecially if you have read the entire series.<br />* Kept me interested the entire time. Sad that it's the end of the series though. Overall a great book and worth reading.<br />* I really wish it would have wrapped up more story ends. But since she is putting out another book that does that I am fine! Great read.<br />* Oh my god , I chose the rating because it was a good book. did not like the cliff hanger though. I wish there was another book in the series I would really recommend this book<br />* Sad to see it all come to an end, but as per usual Charlaine Harris keeps you hooked until the very end....<br />* Too bad it is the last book but a good ending none the less. Looking for a new series from her.<br />* Just loved all of these books in this series...I sure hope that she comes up with the next one soon!<br />* Loved this series of books, from the first, to the last, as well as the ending of the story. Well worth the read<br />* The books are so good sad that applies story is over but all things come to and end she ended up where she belonged safe and sure<br />* Dead Ever After starts out with a twisted point of view and the turn of events are CRAZY good! Keep writing Charlaine!<br />* Since True Blood aired on HBO I began reading the books feverishly. They are so exciting and full of wonderful character and twists and turns.<br />* I loved this book and loved the ending. I just can never get enough of Sookie! I just hate to see the series end.<br />* Love the series! It was a great ending though. So many great aspects of these characters, and it tied up many loose ends for me.<br />* If you like the southern vampire stories of Charlaine Harris, you'll enjoy this book. In truth, I like the books much better than the NBO series.<br />* I guess i didn't expect her to end up with Sam...but all in all it was a great book. It tied ii p all the story lines i had forgotten about.<br />* Another great Skokie stack house novel. So sad that this is the end though glad that things tied up the way I expected!<br />* So sad this is the last one .. however I liked the ending. Now to wait on the series on HBO<br />* Well, so this is the end of this series and I am sorry to see it go but I must say that if our author had to end it she did a great job wrapping it all up and not leaving us any loose ends.<br />* I love these books and am very sad this is the last one. So far many things have happened in the 100 pages or so I have read. I am taking my time with it seeing how its the last one. Plus True Blood starts in a week.<br />* I'm bit sure i like the way it ended but i live that all the loose ends were tied up<br />* Great series! The ending was just what I wanted. I highly recommend these books for anyone. I want to read them all over again. The last book is not really what I expected, but was still great.<br />* Loved this book, sad to see the series end, but loved how it all came together in the end! Thank charlaine Harris for bringing Skokie Stackhouse to life she was Truely memorable.<br />* Great continuation of the series. I could barely put it down. Finally Sookie and Sam are together. Can't wait for the next one.<br />* I loved this series it was funny and exciting and kind of creepy. I will miss Skokie like the loss of a distant friend<br /><br />I can hardly say that all these pages of fluffy 5-star reviews are persuasive.  It is all so very odd.  And why do people say the book is the last of the series and yet there is another book coming?  I'd ask my niece but it would be a giveaway that her favorite uncle is buying her this book.<br /><br />. . . Well, I WAS going to buy her the book, but not anymore.  Looks like I have to pick something else off my niece's wish list.<br /><br />Huh, upon previewing I see I have to rate the book to post this note.  I'll make it 3 stars to be fair.  Certainly was fascinating coming here, that's for sure!
B004EF65QA|4.0|I liked it! However at some points it got a little annoying, just get together all ready. Oh well cute mini series
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love Jeffrey Archer.  He reminds me of Grisham only better.  All his books are so different.  They keep you interested right from the start until the end.  I can hardly wait for the next book on his trilogy.<br /><br />Jody
0670026557|5.0|As entrepreneurs, what kind of people do you think do best in business - the Givers, the Takers or the Matchers?<br /><br />Adam Grant has an answer to that question, and it's one he's qualified to give. He's the youngest tenured professor at the Wharton Business School, USA.<br /><br />Most people, he says, expect that Takers will finish first. But the research he's done has found an answer that will surprise you. Givers finish last, but Takers don't finish first. While some Givers do finish last, other Givers come out on top. Takers and matchers settle in the middle. \\"Otherish Givers\\" - those who nurture themselves - are the ones that win.<br /><br />Grant presents his argument well. He's taken care to ground his opinion in scientific research and he uses case studies to bring his points to life.<br /><br />But what makes this book of greatest value to an entrepreneur is that it's practical. Grant reveals the mistakes Selfless Givers make that see them finish last, and explains why Otherish Givers win. At the end of the book there's a section, \\"Actions for impact\\".<br /><br />Read this to be convinced of the need to become an Otherish Giver - and find a roadmap to get you there.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This isn't a review of the book, as I'm only 1/3 through. (So far, I'm enjoying it.) However, I think the kindle version has a defect that I find very annoying. Unlike the many other books I've bought in the kindle version for my iPad, this one doesn't have the bookmark feature. I have to just hope it will open at the page I ended on. I hope this is fixed for customers who buy it in the future. I've never had this problem before so can only assume it's this book.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I must echo the sentiment of others on this site:<br /><br />CAVEAT EMPTOR: Although it's the same price as past Disney blu-rays with the 3D, 2D and DVD discs, this package ONLY CONTAINS THE BLU-RAY 3D version. My wife doesn't like the 3D versions of movies, so now I have a disc that we cannot watch together.<br /><br />Full disclosure: If I had read the description enough, I would have known; this is totally my fault. But it's clear that Disney was counting on customers not reading the description (guilty) and just ordering.<br /><br />This is bad business, and I'll definitely think twice before ordering any more blu-ray 3Ds from Disney.
B0049985XW|5.0|I saw this long ago on TV as a kid and loved it.  Years later I watched the disc version and was blown away by how good it was!  Basic idea is that Bogart's character (Fred C. Dobbs) is a rough but honest guy down on his luck. With his partner (the excellent Tim Holt) and an old prospector (the great Walter Huston) he goes searching for gold and eventually finds it.  Routine adventure, right?  Directed by John Huston, the film can be seen as an adventure story but on a deeper level it is anuanced character study. Bogart's riveting portrayal of the gradual disintegration of his character from insecurity and greed raises it to something like greatness. The combination of Huston's direction, Bogart's acting and first-class support from Holt and Walter Huston make it an all-time film classic.
B002HL3PN4|3.0|It's and old movie, so I didn't expect too much on the special effects part.  I was not disappointed.  It was cute
B0082XJGRK|4.0|Enjoyed reading... easy read.  We need more of these books in today's society!<br /><br />I wish there were more ways to apply in everyday life examples as the book suggests to do...maybe a f/up book on application would be excellent.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|The first two numbers on this album are outstanding, and then Josh sort of loses me.I saw him sing the first time on the Ally McBeal show, and have liked him so much ever since. But, to appeal more to me as an individual, he needs to &#34;come down&#34; somewhat - and sing in English for those of us who do not understand the foreign languages. Whereas I played Bocelli many times, have only played Groban once. But, I have some of his other albums which I love, so know he will listen to a very faithful fan, and perhaps take a tip from Bocelli?
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Interesting characters and plots.  The stories keep me engaged.  Michael J. Fox appears as an attorney who uses his disability to his advantage.  He plays it well.  The law firm has some internal warfare going on. I wonder which group will win.  Keeps me watching.  Juliana Margolies is great in acting her part as a lawyer getting back into the game and as a wronged wife.
B009BJAPLK|4.0|I enjoy the show despite inconsistencies and ridiculous ending of at least one show.  I would hope future seasons would fix these but it looks like there won't be many more due to actors schedules.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|AFTER WATCHING FOR HALF AN HOUR, MY DAUGHTER AND I AGREED TO STOP THE FILM.  THE ACTING, LANGUAGE CHOICES, AND CHARACTERS WERE FAR FROM ENTERTAINING.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Did not like story structure. There were no characters to be positive about. Did not take long to realize what happened to the wife so not much suspense. It was an easy but boring read.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I am enjoying this latest of quell even more than quell and quell reflect.  I love the added story aspects.  Consider this a rave for the innovative new ideas to make the puzzles challenging and lovely to look at.  Love the music too.  Keep it up!!!!
B00ADLCC9I|4.0|Perfect for childrens and for dads...Excellent relationship between price and functionality.Lightweight, thin and portable. Easy to use for little boys
B004026QIO|2.0|My 6 year old daughter will not wear these because she says they are uncomfortable.  They are cute and what you would expect from crocs.
0007466064|2.0|Seems to be so bloody and depressing. Not a bit of happiness in this thing. This edition went right into deep gothic darkness. Had to put it down.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Stargate SG-1 is a great show. I have finished season 6 and will be starting Season 7 soon. I will be buying the whole series.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|This movie was nominated for Best Picture, and received great reviews...so I watched it, and I didn't like it. None of the characters are very likable; I didn't find myself rooting for anyone. When I don't care about the characters, I generally don't care about the movie.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I liked every song on the album, then I went to see them in concert. They were in the house of blues and it was one of the best concerts I've been to in awhile partially because it was a club like atmosphere instead of a huge stadium.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|For me, it was one of those movies where if I had absolutely nothing to do, it's raining outside and I'm feeling lazy, and this movie is on TV...I'll watch it, be entertained for the most part, but still feel like I wasted the day. Unfortunately, I paid for it, so I had to watch it.<br /><br />The action and special effects are sub-par by today's standards, but not so bad that you just want to turn off the movie...they're serviceable. The acting is fine, not noticeably good or bad. Overall a forgettable, but somewhat entertaining movie.
B00BU18U82|2.0|This is probably a great game assuming one invests a lot of time in learning all its features, schemes, etc. I like challenging games, but don't have the time necessary to learn this one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gideon and Eva's  story continues. Disapointed in another cliff hanger but Sylvia Day doesn't mind keeping us hanging on. I think their path to HEA won't be any easier than in previous books. But they have each other as never before  with so many new issues to deal with, and I believe they will do it together. Marilyn Allen
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Neat graphics; easy to learn and fun to play. Challenging enough to hold my interest, but relatively easy to learn.
B00A83075M|5.0|We love this film, watched it over and over. All thumbs up from my two year old daughter to my 22 year old son.
B005K17RU0|4.0|its a great app but just a tad bit(a lot) slower than it used to be....but I do like the new features it has.
B003AVPV1O|4.0|Its compact build was nice to reduce the birdnest of cables behind the pc but the down side is the weight since install had to reinsert my gpu card after adding support it never reoccurred since. in all works great with minor interruption of solving its weight issue
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have always liked action/adventure/sci-fi related stories.  I  have several books written by the most widely recognized authors.  This series holds it' s own with any of them.  Great character development.  Twists and turns.  Adventure seemingly built into every page.  It was fun from beginning to end.  It is hard to find a good book with a truly unique idea behind the storyline.  This is the one I have been waiting for.  If you like a solid story mixed with an insane amount of creativity, I recommend you read this series.  I would love to shake Hugh Howey' s hand and tell him personally..JOB WELL DONE SIR, THANK YOU.  Now the hard part is waiting for more.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is amazing! There are violent parts so beware. Ender really touched my heart though. Orson Scott did a every good job. I recommend  this book to higher level readers and anyone under the age of 12 should not read Ender's Game, it's a violent book with complex writing. I enjoyed this book so much though. Just to warn you you might shed some tears. I love this book and I hope you do to!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great movie great actors great effects loved this movie I can't wait for the others to come out. Well worth your time spent watching
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Always a good game. Keeps you wanting to go on and get other cars and lands. Cant stop playing. 5 yr old god son loves it
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie was fast moving and followed the books quite well. I think they cast this movie exceptionally well. The characters were quite believable. Well worth the time spent watching it.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I bought this album when it was on sale for $0.99. At the time I only knew &#34;Thrift Shop&#34;, but at that price I figured why not. I was really surprised how much I liked the album. It's much deeper than I expected. Many people compare rappers to poets, and in Macklemore's case this is tough to argue. His songs aren't the typical rap songs about gangsters and thugs. He raps about different topics, including baseball and gay rights. He even has a song based around the 10,000 hours theme of Malcom Gladwell's &#34;Outliers&#34;.<br />I bought the album for one fun song, but I now appreciate every song for what he has to say.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|kids love this old movie. so cute to see them enjoy something from my childhood. please keep this on the list in prime.
B000023VR9|4.0|Bought the original and was unhappy with the verbage so gave it away and bought him this which he seems happy with.
B006TLFPKO|2.0|I was not impressed with this movie.  I didn't like the books either so can't say I wasn't prepared.  It's all just a little to dramatic for me.
B0038LB4TE|4.0|Lee Child's books run at a fast rate and are hard to put down.  However is it really necessary to be so gory?
0062213423|5.0|My niece just turned 13, and I got her this book about her fav group One Direction. She went nuts! Once she started reading, she couldn't put it down. She loves it!
B0083Z614S|5.0|A well known and popular book.  Probably best known from the various film versions that have been made. As yet I have not seen any film version that comes close to the book.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|such an interesting game a brain teaser that's what I love about it it wakes the brain to get those three stars
B003TTKB5I|3.0|Compared to everything else there is to watch on TV now, it was above average. Good story, good acting. I am old fashioned although I don't think good morals get old, but I think there is too much emphasis on low moral behavior on the show.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|this movie just doesn't seem to really go anywhere. i understand the plot, but there isn't much to it. the kid is born evil and stays evil. that's it. that's the movie.
B00005JKJA|2.0|The movie arrived on time.  I was not delighted with he lack of a dvd menu on it because I couldn't start and pick it up later.  The movie kept me entertained for the first showing, doubt I will watch it again though.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|Would love a refund! I have tried and read instructions and it doesn't sync with my android google calendar. I have no use for it.
0811879542|5.0|This is a fantastic book for children.  It is entertaining and colorful, but as a teacher, I also appreciated the skills and ideas that it helps to develop in children.  Concepts of left and right, up and down, following directions, color recognition, pattern recognition, cause and effect, large and small, and so much more are all presented in fun and interesting ways.  Children who are used to &#34;interactive&#34; books on electronic devices will especially enjoy this low-tech version of an &#34;interactive book.&#34;
B0050DIWFC|5.0|An emotional read on a taboo subject.<br />Hard not to rush to the end to see what happens.  A parent's nightmare.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I got into this show late, so I was able to watch Seasons 1, 2, 3 in a marathon style viewing. On one hand I'm glad that I got to overdose on so many episodes at once. On the other hand, I can't believe I missed out on this amazing show for as long as I did.<br /><br />Since anyone can find many critics reviews, fan sites, and twitter accounts related to this show, I will try to keep my review short and sweet: I made my cousin, my housemate, and my bestie watch this entire series - all at separate times. Thus I have watched the entire series approximately 4 times (as I watched with each of them and once on my own). I have found new layers to the story with every viewing. Each one of them thanked me for introducing them to this show & each one sends me ridiculous amounts of text messages on Tuesday nights when the show is playing live - of course we only reply during commercials because it is impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen when the show is airing.<br /><br />Overall - this is the first TV show that I actually bought all of the DVD set for each season. This would be the first entertainment item that would accompany me to a deserted island. Although I buy the Amazon Season Pass now with my Roku box, I will still buy the DVDs upon their release just for the extras on the discs. Yes, this show is worth paying for it twice!
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|Walt Disney had a fascination with the \\"Oz\\" books even prior to the 1939 MGM classic.  He later bought the rights to 11 \\"Oz\\" books, but passed away before a worthwhile production was developed.  His vision was to follow the original format as a musical.  In fact scrapped \\"Oz\\" productions(some featuring the original Mouseketeers)were partly responsible for creating the hits \\"Babes in Toyland\\" and \\"Mary Poppins\\".  So isn't there anyone alive today who could have come up with a few snappy songs, to complement the original?  Where's Elton John when you need him?  Instead we get just another SFX ladden CGI spectacle with little of the warmth and wonder of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\".  It's plot is to satisfy our curiosity on how the wizard became the wizard.  James Franco is likable as the fraudulent carnival magician, that ulimately inherits the crown of the Emerald City.  Any number of actresses could have qualified to play the witches.  Franco's cohorts, a porcelain doll and a flying bellhop monkey contribute a laugh or two.  The big payoff battle at the films conclusion pays homage to Thomas Edison and early 20th Century technology, used cleverly to defeat the evil witches sorcery.  Like the even more inferior 1985 \\"Return to Oz\\", this film lacks the charm that made the original a memorable classic.  Didn't we all care about Dorothy, the scarecrow, cowardly lion, and the tin man?
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|In a review of a different animated/kids movie, I said that I would only give a movie 5 stars if I would take it to a deserted island with me. Well Wall-E can come to my island.<br /><br />I originally rented this to watch with my young nieces but we all loved it so much that I had to purchase a copy. In fact, I'm not ashamed to say that I have (re)watched Wall-E when the kids weren't around. I'm an environmentally conscious person so this movie is up my alley but I also think it's an amazing teaching tool for parents and anyone involved with children. It makes the difficult topic of environmental conservation and garbage dumps simple to understand - as well as the repercussions of ignoring these issues. It doesn't have a political slant, although it does jab at the advertising industry a bit, this movie is more of a logical if/then type of statement. This movie was well done. Although the dialogue is limited, it sends a significant message.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for any person of any age.
B0017IXOLG|5.0|Every single album on this song is amazing. Each one tells a truth about human experience, either an individuals or the whole of humanity. There isn't enough words or a single word that can describe how amazing this album is.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I bought this during a holiday sale for about $4 to watch with my nieces. Had I realized it was so good, I wouldn't have waited so long to purchase this movie. While it is obviously animated, there is an adult story line which are kid friendly. I'm an environmentally conscious person so this movie was right up my alley. As for the nieces, aged 5 and 9 years old, they loved it and we watched it multiple times. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it didn't completely knock me off my feet - I reserve 5 stars for movies that I would take to a deserted island. In any case, it's a good movie that won't make adults doze off while the kids are watching.
193700788X|5.0|I loved this series, even though there were a few characters and stories that were a little slow.  I think it was bright and well written.  I was very sorry that this is the end of the Sookie series.

B002H0DX96|5.0|This movie works at two levels: 1) a love of baseball, how this love  fits into our American consciousness and how we can be let down by our heroes (or maybe they are misunderstood?), and 2) longing for lost and unfulfilled family relationships. And it is successful at  both levels. It works so well because it never deals with the sentiments directly until the end. Also it is a fantasy that completely rings true emotionally and yet unfolds so unpredictably that you are never ahead of the story and willingly go along for the ride which ends with a very satisfying resolution. It has the dual level story telling that made Night Shyamalan's &#34;Sixth Sense&#34; (without the surprise twist at the end) and &#34;Signs&#34; so interesting. All the characters are interesting and I loved the acting even in the supporting roles (Amy Madigan is so real in the face of the most fantastical elements of the story). The lines are iconic: &#34;Is this heaven? No, it is Iowa.&#34; Even the elements work to enhance this film: the fog on the baseball field the night when Shoeless Joe Jackson first appears. This is one film where everything comes together just right.

B004SOR4H6|5.0|I can stay connected where ever I go and not miss updates from my peeps.  Plus it's on my kindle.
B006GECE9Y|3.0|I had a hard time finding a version that would download and appear on my Kindle. I actually ended up getting it from somewhere else. So far my experience has been that it &#34;doesn't respond&#34; and needs to close down. And, unlike IE on my PC, it doesn't reopen and restore the tabs that were open, so you have to go back and find all the things you had open. However, I am glad that I can use Adobe Flash with this system.
0399160450|5.0|This is Tom Clancy, what more can I say. I am not finished reading it yet but I have never been disappointed in any of the Clancy/Ryan novels.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|It is exactly what I was looking for.  It was the perfect gift for  the baby shower it was purchased for.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Outstanding acting, original storylines, elaborate set design and great supporting musical score. Complicated plots and multiple subplots kept me coming back for more.
B001GXNBJW|5.0|The Black Keys pound The White Stripes into oblivion! When the hot Ukrainian immigrant girl I met mentioned them as her favorites, I knew I was onto something.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The mouse fits average to big hands.  If you have small hands(less than 6 1/2 inch from middle finger tip to bottom of palm) don't try it.  You won't be able to effectively use the 3 thumb buttons.  For everyone else, it's awesome.  8000 dpi makes for fluid motion, extra long cord a bonus, response time insane and comfort grip for hours of gameplay.  If all else fails they have GREAT customer support.  If you are not satisfied with this product, they will take back no questions asked.  That's solid customer support.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Although dark and full of hate, I can't help but admire the character of Emily. Suspense and intrigue in every episode.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I wanted to be able to read it anyplace I went. It's smaller than my bible therefore easier to carry.<br /><br />My great granddaughter has it on her ipad and showed it to me.<br /><br />I would recommend it to any one that has a device that they can download it onto.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I liked watching it. Sometimes cheezy but still overall the idea is great. graphics are good and I recommend it.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This book really has changed my life... i re-read it often. you have to get Turning Pro as well since it will just add right on top of the info here
B00AF6B22E|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie but it was very disappointing. The sound quality was very poor.I had to constantly turn the volume up and down and was still hard to understand.The foul language is terrible as is the drugs drinking and lifestyle of all the main characters
B00B2166BS|5.0|I hadn't seen the Pogo charger before but it had good reviews on the net so I took a chance  and I love it.  Main thing is, now, I don't have to worry about the constant wear and tear on my mini-usb port when charging.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Myst like puzzle with nice graphics and cool animations. Worth $2 just for the eye candy. Can't wait to see more of this.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I am a Connery Bond fan so I am a little biased but I thought Craig does an exceptional job portraying Bond.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Not sure any we never watched this before but it is a great show.  The setting is a law firm as well as politics. In a lot of ways it seemed like the first season of damages.
B0036S4C6G|3.0|Egan uses a not uncommon literary device to illustrate her characters going in and out of time periods using a variety of points of view to follow an intertwined cast throughout many decades.  The effect has a unique flavor...even it it isn't necessarily original...and it provides for an interesting twist in what is a wholly unremarkable tale.  I have to say that the book was well written, well thought out and gave an interesting take on what the &#34;near future&#34; may look like...one might almost class the book as sci-fi (in fact HAD the author followed her vision of the future in a darker version she may have given PKD a run for the money) however the brief foray into a disconnected future that seems startlingly possible closes the book instead of opening it.  In the end though...and this is how I &#34;judge&#34; a book...I forgot about it and it's characters almost as soon as I put it down.  I finished it...and that's saying something...but nothing about it stuck with me.
B000V7H7HG|4.0|For the price, this fence compliments the rest of our set very well.<br /><br />When fully assembled, the fence is able to enclose a large number of animals and is scaled to match that of the other animals.<br /><br />The fence sections can be detached fairly easily, but stay together well.<br /><br />This is what you would expect of the Schleich brand.
B008XBASVY|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK probably the only thing I didn't liKE WAS  thE LANGUAGE  but other than that it is definitely a book I will 're read =)

B00CH87HF4|5.0|awesome game. allows u to run around and do sub missions and go wherever u want. best dungeon hunter yet!
B008JJM88Q|4.0|The game can be addicting & a fun time waster. On that it can a bit redundant. But overall is really good game
B00493E1GI|3.0|the redeeming quality was that the locations were the same as the book (per my wife) and that why she enjoyed it - not reading the book I was bored, it was slow and had the pizza not been in the room I would have left.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have been counting down until this book came out. Sadly I am a little disappointed. Almost every time I thought something really juicy was going to happen Sylvia skipped it only hinting to what happened. It just pretty much was a few pages of something fun or interesting or intense then back to sex. I loove me some hot Gideon sex don't get me wrong, but when I feel like I am reading the same sex scene over and over every few pages I got bored. I got bored with Mark thing to. They talked about that more than the actual drama with Eva here dad and her mom. I ended up skipping a few pages b/c of it. I was also hoping that we would of seen more of Eva and Brett. Not had her and Gideon jump right back together immediately. I think fans would of enjoyed seeing if there was still a spark between them. Maybe had them go out to a club or something an see Eva let lose and not be stalked my Gideon Spies. She would of realized her heart belongs with Gideon eventually but would of been fun to see that other side of her. I also didn't like how we didn't really see much of Cary and Eva. I love their relationship and wished we could of saw more of that but hoping we see more of them in beginning of Book 4. For book four PLEASE SYLVIA more drama and don't skip over scenes that fans would find exciting!!<br /><br />Those are the only reason's I didn't give it a 5. But Gideon the hottt sex machine he is gets a 5 just b/c he is my Top Book Boyfriend &lt;3
B000HZD168|5.0|I am a devoted Star Trek the original series fan. The original and the best. I saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan back in 1982 when I was a teenager. I was really excited to see it because when I heard that they were going to start making Star Trek movies I immediately thought (like probably many other Star Trek fans) that they should bring back Khan who I hated in the original series episode Space Seed, I loved it when Capt. Kirk beat him to the ground in the engineering room. That said I had high hopes for The Wrath of Khan movie I was disappointed when I saw it because I was looking for the old original cast camaraderie from the original series which I thought they got back with the next movie Star Trek III: Search for Spock. I decided to watch it again after seeing the new Star Trek: Into Darkness movie and after this viewing it has become one of my favorite Star Trek movies, I even now think it is a better movie than Search for Spock which I still love, The Wrath of Khan is a more solid movie, it is very well written and I have always loved the iconic death scene at the end between Spock and Kirk the acting is very touching. I guess I can know appreciate it looking at it through mature eyes and not the eyes of a teenager looking for the same feelings that I get when I watch the original 60s series. I leave you with three iconic lines from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan: \\"Khannnnn!\\", \\"Remember\\", \\"He's dead already\\".
B004IK8Q86|5.0|Set in the 1920's and 30's about various rich folks who each have their own agenda in life....the traumatized war hero who wants to &#34;loaf&#34;, his smitten fiance who HAS to have fine dining, wining, dresses and surroundings, the writer who keeps track of it all, the European Life of the Party who deals in antiques, and the young driven American who has a crush on smitten fiance....and they all have to deal with a world wide CRASH in 1929.....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the the best one ever! And I say that with all of my heart! GET IT!  GOT THAT!?!?!?!? :)
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This 3D Blu-Ray DVD plays excellently on my Panasonic 3D player and 3D HDTV.  The effects are subtle, but amazing.  I've seen some 3D movies (on my system) that were &#34;overdone&#34;.  3D yes, but, way too much.  Not pleasant to watch.  This 3D is GREAT.
B008220DGE|5.0|EXCELLENT
B0087ITBPC|5.0|Funny movie - with touching parts.  Good to watch with your grown-up kids who don't appreciate you like they should.
B00CRQV1TY|4.0|This is a really a great album.  It's so cool to hear not just cover songs, but actually John Fogerty playing some of the great CCR songs with younger/modern day bands!  It really shows just how talented he is and how evergreen his music style remains!  The 1st track on the album is a great rendition of &#34;Fortunate Son&#34; with The Foo Fighters!  It really kicks butt!  He has a few new songs on here too and they are great!  &#34;Mystic Highway&#34; is the standout track on the album in my opinion.  It's got a great grove to it, that just drives its way into my brain!  This is a very country music album, so be aware of that.  I'm generally not a huge fan of country music, but it's just too cool to hear modern re-imaginings of some truly great Creedence songs, by the original artist.  I only wish there were more!  Notably missing are &#34;Up Around The Bend&#34; and &#34;Lookin' Out My Back Door&#34;.  Hopefully they will show up somewhere &#34;up around the bend!&#34;  Great album!
1449410243|5.0|This book is a lot of fun! And it doesn't surprise me that it is from The Onion. Not only does the book describe the signs that your cat may be plotting to kill you, but it also gives you signs to look out for to tell if your cat is gay, why cats are better than babies, and has strips from the comic &#34;The Bobcats,&#34; for anyone familiar.<br /><br />It also comes with a pull out poster listing some of the signs of your cat trying to kill you. It is good to have a guide to reference when you want to know why your cat is kneading you (checking for vital organs), or why they sprint out of rooms when you walk in (failed attempt at an ambush.)<br /><br />If you like cats and like a good laugh, this book is a must have.
B009R659L8|5.0|Loved this book. Could hardly put it down. So my twist in it you couldn't guess who was the killer
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The product was in good condition when it arrived. I bought a used cable but it looked like brand new when it got here and worked without a hitch. It did take several weeks to ship due to the fact that I live in Wisconsin, but it was packaged safely and I don't have any other complaints besides that.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|I have tried to use this with limited success. In order to get an adequate score on the bottle you have to apply so much pressure that you end up flexing the metal bars which causes your score to not line up when you complete the score aroiund the bottle. I would like it better if it were more stable. Im going to try a model where i lay the bottle down to score.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|One star for Disney's decision to charge consumers full price for a 3D only disc. If this becomes a trend then I will start buying Disney films at second hand shops.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|The Product Itself<br />----------------------------<br />The CD has a nice sleeve for it. The picture above is the wrong color the sleeve has the same design just different colors is has white text with a black background with a worn effect added. The sleeve has all of the songs listed on the back<br />1.The End<br />2.DEAD!<br />3.This Is How I Disappear<br />4.The Sharpest Lives<br />5.Welcome To The Black Parade<br />6.I Don't Love You<br />7.House Of Wolves<br />8.Cancer<br />9.Mama<br />10.Sleep<br />11.Teenagers<br />12.Disenchanted<br />13.Famous Last Words<br /><br />Now on the inside it has a nice mini poster with lyrics to the songs (I believe not all of the lyrics are there to every song). The mini poster is a great addition to the CD because it has so many GREAT details and it has pictures of our beloved band consisting of Gerard, Mikey, Frank, Ray, and Bob. I am a huge fan of My Chemical Romance and I can say that this is an AWESOME album! Any killjoy knows The Black Parade is a MUST HAVE ALBUM!!!! I would recommend buying it!!!!<br /><br />Shipping and Quality<br />--------------------------<br />Now the one thing I have to say about the shipping is it had taken quite a while to get here. I had ordered Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge and The Black Parade from the same seller on the same day at the same time yet they came separately. I just had to inform you on that. Now on the quality, it had came in GREAT condition! Not really any wearing on the CD that was not supposed to be there. The disk is completely clean from what I can tell (and I didn't have to clean it either). I must say again THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT AND I SERIOUSLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Lots of information.  Pictures.  Video.  Easy to change between locations.  Have found it to be very accurate.  Recommend it to all my friends.
B00025ETIW|5.0|The Album Itself<br />---------------------<br />Now as a HUGE My Chemical Romance Fan I have to say this is my absolute FAVORITE album. This album even includes the VERY FIRST My Chemical Romance song that I had ever listened to \\"Helena\\" and my personal theme song \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\". This album had came out in 2003 and it had been their second album released. Now the CD has all of the songs listed on the back.<br />1.Helena<br />2.Give 'Em Hell Kid<br />3.To The End<br />4.You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison<br />5.I'm Not Okay (I Promise)<br />6.The Ghost Of You<br />7.The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill you<br />8.Interlude<br />9.Thank You For The Venom<br />10.Hang 'Em High<br />11.It's Not A Fashion Statement, It's A F***ing Deathwish<br />12.Cemetary Drive<br />13.I Never Told You What I Do For A Living<br /><br />Now the CD case is pretty basic It has the same cover as in the picture above except it's not faded. The CD itself has a white background with red text and a red cross rosary printed on it. Inside of the cover has the lyrics to all of the songs (not the complete lyrics I believe) and the white background with a grey printed cross rosary. The cover also includes all of the people the whole band would like to thank, special thanks, whom Mikey Would like to thank, whom Ray would like to thank, whom Frank would like to thank, whom Matt would like to thank, and whom Gerard would like to thank. As I had said before this is my absolute favorite album and I HIGHLY recommend purchasing a copy.<br /><br />The Shipping and Quality<br />--------------------------------<br />The shipping was fine it came at a reasonable time and it came unharmed. The quality of the CD was pretty much perfect except for 2 small cracks/nicks in the case and a small bit of wear but I wouldn't make such a fuss over it because it is absolutely pointless because it isn't really that severe nor is it that big of a deal. I REALLY RECOMMEND MY FELLOW KILLJOYS BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Use it everyday.  Got rid of my regular alarm clock.  I love that it can be programmed to wake to music and will play anything that you choose.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Story was very disconnected, not very clear where it leads. Random people start showing up at the end without any connection
B009O2XY12|5.0|Move over drugs...try this game.  It sucks you in and you just want to keep going level after level until you beat it.
0385302320|5.0|I love the entire series...paperbacks were falling apart...had to get hardbacks!  The series is very much worth the time to read!
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|My fiance talked about this movie for years. We finally bought and watched it. I'm so glad we own it now. I loved all the unique intricacies in the production such as adding cartoons, dance numbers, and a non-chronological plot.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I needed a long extension in our family room from my computer to my big screen TV. Now I can sit on my couch and use the webcam with my grandkids.
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|I rented this on the Amazon Prime site, which was downloaded to my iPad. When you download, no internet connection is required to watch your clip. Thanks to Amazon, I was able to watch a movie in-flight when Netflix and HBO Go wouldn't allow me to do the same.
0316010669|4.0|I think that this book has been over hyped and confused some through it's title.<br />I found it a good read that helps us not to dismiss those first impressions and the human instincts that quickly gather data when encountering something or someone for the first time. What is the value of those important instant observations? Should we quickly dismiss them? Most of us have been trained to \\"deeply ponder\\" over every decision that we make, but what if something comes at us too quickly? Mr. Gladwell uses some fascinating and fun examples of experiences and case histories of psychologists that really make you stop and think.<br />One thing that I will be doing is picking up a copy of his earlier book 'The Tipping Point\\".
0812993357|4.0|It's a great book! I bought as a xmas present for a friend and she totally loved it! Thumbs up! :)
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was different than other's I have read. I couldn't put this book down and the poetry was great!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love puzzles, this game is perfect. You can choose how many pieces u want , and you can make the pieces rotate or not to give it a little more difficulty. The pictures are lovely and u can buy more if u want.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story is so unique and beautifully written. I was either smiling or trying to pick my jaw up from the floor throughout this entire book...maybe a few tears. Awesome, awesome, awesome.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|From the costumes to the story line to the intrigue.  Didn't matter that I know &#34;how it ends&#34;.  Couldn't stop watching once I started.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Is it really even necessary to review Mad Men? Everything about Mad Men is amazing and awesome and everything happy in between!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Took me a while to get into this book, but once I did I couldn't put it down. Lots of great twists and turns.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this series, and this season certainly didn't disappoint! Got my item quickly and at a far better deal than I could have at the retailers around me so I'm thrilled :)
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great read, throughly enjoyed it. Related to the foster placement theme. Was surprised with the how story brought everything to life.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A very easy well written book. Puts the reader back in the chair, when you say to yourself that this is now.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Stupid good. I can't even. Just watch it. It's filled with too much awesome and brilliance. And series two, I can't even. Just watch it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|U can expand ur island, talk to friends, decorate ur island, buy dragons, gift gold to friends, evolve dragons, plant and harvest food for them,  breed dragons and much more! It's amazing and every 5 minutes I find myself checking in to my island. U can have friends too! There r many different types of dragons. There r water, diamond, dark, fire, magic, light, air, and plant. In these there r a few non hybrid dragons which u breed to get the colorful  hybrids. Like if u breed a fire dragon with a forest dragon u can hatch a life dragon. Hint: it stumps many people on how to breed the magic dragon to unlock the magic group. The magic group is represented by a purple stone, red+blue=purple. So by breeding a fire dragon with a water  dragon u can get the magic dragon and unlock the awesome Hebrides everyone is after. Best thing is tht it's free! So buy it now! :)
1451695195|5.0|I opened the book and did not move until I had finished it. Dr. Alexander has put into words what is true: that we are loved beyond our deepest imaginings, and that we are all soaking in god's tender and delicious love at all times. Thank you for this utterly amazing story of life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first played subway surfers I thought it was the best running game I ever played and I loved it

B008VBYN80|5.0|this game is amazing i love everything about it game loft hit a home run with this game. try it
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I like Crossfire novels, and after reading first two books in four days I had to wait just over a month for this book to be published. My only complaint is that we have to wait yet again for a new book!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I enjoy the game because I love animals.  I honestly think this game is worth the time that you can and will put into it
B009A9EPLM|4.0|I really liked the movie, Lincoln, and was immediately struck by the music that went with it.  I noticed right away how well the music was played when I was watching the movie, and then later noticed in the movie credits that the Chicago Symphony performed for the soundtrack.  I was not surprised, as they have consistently been a top-rate orchestra for many decades.  I have many recordings done by the Chicago Symphony.  Now I have another one that I enjoy.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Well written context and bitter conflicts about US involvement in WWII before Pearl Harbor.  I would recommend it for anyone interested in US history.

B005KDDUVS|5.0|He empezado esta novela varias veces durante años.  Pero en mi última lectura ya se hizo un proyecto que no podía dejar de acabar.  Es una de las novelas más perfectas que he leído. No queda ni un solo cabo suelto.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I love this game. The original kept me challenged for months and this new version has the added benefit of sparkles! Great for a way to pass the time...
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Love this series.  And the quality of the BluRay disc was excellent! The menu system was dramatically different and better than the DVD versions.
B009IF82SK|1.0|They should come up with good story. It seems they have grown up in last 5 seasons and story needs to adjust to show that fact. Most of the episodes are about everyone doing some repetitive tasks, trying to exploits absurdities of their extreme behaviors to make their audience laugh. It is a no longer brilliant, intelligent comedy it used to be.
B00C2U6G7C|2.0|When I first heard that the Man of Steel reboot was also going to \\"reboot\\" the music score, I was concerned that there are, at most, only two or three composers alive who would have the slightest chance of successfully following John Williams' iconic score to 1979's Superman.  One of those two or three composers, and the one on whom I would most readily put my money to actually succeed at following Williams, is Hans Zimmer.  So, needless to say, I was more than just a little interested to learn that, indeed, Zimmer was the one selected.<br /><br />Most soundtrack connoisseurs would agree that Williams' Superman is among the finest soundtracks he ever wrote, so there would naturally be a great deal of pressure on a music reboot.  However, considering the tremendous success that Zimmer (along with James Newton Howard, another person on the aforementioned list of 2-3 composers) enjoyed in rebooting the music for the Batman/Dark Knight Trilogy (following Danny Elfman's popular score for Tim Burton's Batman), it seemed only fair to give Zimmer an honest chance to have similar success, if not even better, with Man of Steel.<br /><br />Today, with the highly anticipated release of Zimmer's new soundtrack finally available for listening, I have to report, with disappointment, that this is not one of his better efforts. And what's most disappointing about it is that it's not the figure of John Williams that is overshadowing this soundtrack - it's Hans Zimmer himself.<br /><br />Several of Zimmer's previous scores are so distinctively individual, even while having the signature \\"Zimmer sound\\", that one only has to play a few seconds of the music before visual images and associations from the respective movie immediately spring to mind.  The solo cello theme for Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean series and the triumphant music that accompanies Simba's victorious ascent up Pride Rock in The Lion King are only two examples of this.  (For those of you who are now hearing those two examples in your mind as you read this, you just proved my point.)<br /><br />Themes and sound pictures from other movies such as Crimson Tide, Gladiator, The Last Samurai, the previously mentioned Dark Knight trilogy, The Prince of Egypt, and the Robert Langdon duology (The DaVinci Code/Angels & Demons) are all examples where Zimmer's music so effectively came to represent the movie and various characters within that it's almost impossible to hear the music without thinking of the movie it represents.  So even though John Williams' Superman is a very tough act to follow, Hans Zimmer himself is also a very tough act to follow.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as I listened to this soundtrack, I was not able to find anything about it that struck me as being distinctive or highly characterized.  Zimmer has demonstrated a prodigious gift for melody on previous occasions (especially in The Last Samurai, The Lion King, and The Prince of Egypt), but in the entire soundtrack for Man of Steel, astonishingly enough, I was not able to detect even one single viable tune or melody.  (I'm not kidding, I meant that exactly the way I typed it.)<br /><br />The entire soundtrack is one long, uninterrupted experience in generic, constant ambience, punctuated by some of the most thunderous drumming that you will ever hear on an orchestral soundtrack.  Make no mistake, this soundtrack will set off all the seismographs in your area.  But the problem is that it seems as if we could take this soundtrack and apply it to various sections of other movies besides Man of Steel, and it would be almost impossible to find anything amiss in the process of doing so.<br /><br />Try borrowing the music from some of the other movies I mentioned previously, and you could never get away with it, because Zimmer made the music for those movies too distinctive to ever be used anywhere else.  And that is precisely what a great movie composer is supposed to do.<br /><br />With Man of Steel, unfortunately, this is not the case.<br /><br />The Man of Steel soundtrack will be very useful for removing the glass from all your windows and testing the structural integrity of your home.  But after it's over, you won't be whistling any tunes, because there are none to whistle.<br /><br />Another thing that concerns me about this is that music is far more powerful than most people realize in determining the level of impact a movie has on its viewers.  Try watching 1975's Jaws or the Lord of the Rings trilogy with the sound off, so that you can't hear the music, and notice how uninvolved and detached it makes you feel from the movie.  So with this in mind, I can't help wondering if Zimmer's indistinctive soundtrack for Man of Steel might doom the movie to have an indistinctive impact on its viewers.  We'll see over the next few weeks as ratings/reviews are posted on IMDb.tely, this is not the case.<br /><br />The Man of Steel soundtrack will be very useful for removing the glass from all your windows and testing the structural integrity of your home.

B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffrey Archer has become one of my go to writers.  His story telling never disappoints.  Have loved this series and anxious for the next book.  Very easy to pick up where the last book left off.  Characters and plot line very well developed.  If you are just starting book one you will want to read straight thru to the last book.... WONDERFUL!!!  Just wish he could write faster....<br /><br />In all his novels, he grabs you right away and doesn't let go until the last page.....
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a fun and continuously exciting game that never fails to entertain. A must download for sure.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Would have liked if all the seasons came with BluRay, DVD, amd Ultraviolet but it is the show that matters. We currently have all 5 Blu Ray seasons. They are all great quality and we enjoy watching them.
0345803485|5.0|Oh my gosh, what a book....It is a must read if anyone needs a little boost in the bedroom.....read all three of these books, and waiting for the fourth to come out, hopfully...great read.....thank you so much ....

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Well, I was hoping when I began the book, that it wouldn't be the end. Then I got to the end and almost screamed because it's continued!! Well played Mrs. Day, well played,<br />All I need to know now is when the next book is set for release. Please say it's soon.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This was such a funny and light hearted  movie! I really enjoyed watching it because it was very entertaining  and fun!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|there's a reason it's sold more than 20,000 copies!  Very inspirational!  You will see the world in a different light.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This is a big series and It's been a good read...enjoy the time spent on the day to day life of the events esp. in the Americas
B008M0UTRO|4.0|I have not seen Goro Miyazaki's other film, &#34;Tales from Earthsea&#34; (which did not get terribly good reviews) but I definitely liked this one a lot.  Of course, it was scripted by his father, Hayao Miyazaki, which cannot hurt.  Of all the other Ghibli films I've seen, this one most closely resembles the wonderful &#34;Whisper of the Heart,&#34; only the music is not nearly as good here.<br /><br />The movie's period setting is very interesting; the high-school antics are amusing; the characters are all likable, and the heroine's story of loss and first love is sweetly told, although it threatens to take a slightly &#34;creepy&#34; turn at one point.  Of course, if you already go in with the expectation that everything will turn out all right in the end, you can ride over that bump.<br /><br />The animation, colors, backgrounds, etc., are all top-notch, as one expects from Ghibli.<br /><br />I believe this is coming out in English &#34;sometime soon,&#34; but if you do not want to wait, this is a very good deal right now.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book held my interest even though parts were a little too aggressive for me.  I liked it but the ending was very unrealistic.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Every one of these books gets harder and harder to put down. Between the history porn and the amazing story, Brown knows what he's doing.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read this book in only 2 days!  I just could not put it down.  The writing style is completely different than other similar books and from the guys perspective.  I liked the comical bluntness of it all and can't wait for the next book.
B006CJAUEO|5.0|great stuff ... feeling very pleased with ... this article fits my smartphone and works as well as the original part ...
B005LAIH2C|4.0|I remember reading this book when I was kid and I liked it but I never realized how dark of a story it was! They did a fantastic job with doing this movie! It had a very Burtonesque feel to it without being a Burton film. I loved every minute of this movie. It had some twists and turns that I never saw coming and the characters are very well casted. The only thing I didn't care much for was how the main Witch's makeup was done. She looked like a female version of the Saw character with piercing blue eyes. There were so many different ways they could've improved her makeup but overall it was a great movie with lots of action! A definite must see :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A great little puzzle game that actually has real puzzles that make you think. It sadly wasn't very long but it was a lot of fun. Not a bad little game for the price.
B00CX1TSSO|3.0|This movie was OK, special effects rule the day. It was nice to see the visual references to the original story.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have watched all of the episodes so far and am waiting on the last episode where it appears like Gibbs is going to shoot his good friend.
B007Y36K46|4.0|There are weaknesses in &#34;John Carter.&#34; Leading man Taylor Kitsch is a little too well-groomed for someone supposedly living the life he does, and the 'princess fleeing hateful arranged marriage with villain' plot is old to the point of cliche. But considering that &#34;John Carter&#34; is based on &#34;A Princess of Mars,&#34; one of the granddaddies of science fiction, I think we can safely give that one a pass.<br /><br />John Carter, jaded Civil War veteran, is accidentally transported to Mars and finds himself in the middle of another civil war--this one between the warring cities of Helium and Zodanga. Caught in the middle are the Tharks, a race of green-skinned, four-armed Martians who remain neutral in the conflict and heartily hope that both sides blow each other to smithereens. All John wants is to find his way back to Earth, but when the Martian princess of Helium begs for his help, how long can he keep refusing?<br /><br />This is not a subtle film. We have good guys, bad guys and a hero, and it's always obvious who is who. But it's an adventure--loud, rollicking, wide-ranging, and not above winking at the viewer occasionally. Some days you want deep political drama, and on those days I watch &#34;Downfall.&#34; When I want to be transported to an alien world where swords intermingle with advanced technology and a reluctant Earthman may just be the key to winning an ancient war, I watch &#34;John Carter,&#34; and I have a whale of a good time doing it.
B00B6QXN56|4.0|I have seen Joe in concert twice. This is a very good CD for relaxing and just good music. A must for Joe's fans.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved this book. she is changing so much... I don't know who to root for anymore....  I am rooting for her. I don't care who she ends up with, I just want her to succeed... I loved it.
B006S039YU|5.0|In all the hub bub over Disney buying, and then integrating Pixar, we might forget that the gold standard for US animators was, and in some respect still is, Disney. And Mulan (and the more recent Wreck-it Ralph) is a reminder of how great they have been, at their best. The characteristics of great Disney animation? Starts with a superb story - just the right balance of being grounded in Chinese history, and also trying to speak to our more modern world, where women truly are trying to be treated as equals of men. Add to that exquisitely beautiful backgrounds and character work, which speaks to a long tradition of Chinese visual art, and then excellent voicing by everyone from Eddie Murphy to George Takei. And, here is the best test - if a film makes you cry, then it is really doing something, and this one does it for me a couple of times: first, when Mulan's father says &#34;the greatest honor is having you as a daughter&#34; and later, when Mulan brings honor home to the family. Yes, its a bit schmaltzy, but who doesn';t love a bit of schmaltz now and then?
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|Love the stories but I don't like this doctor. Skipped to season 2 and went back later to watch episodes that tied into other seasons.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I absolutely loved this series! It was full of adventure and gruesome details that'll make you shiver! I recommend it to everyone who wants a little mystery and excitement in their life.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Wonderful must read!  Such a courageous wonderful girl and woman!  I wish her so much happiness in her new life!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved it. For once a book that is in the guys POV. It was funny, it was steamy. Some parts I busted out laughing and other parts I had to fan myself. I can't wait to read more from this author.
B005KELW26|3.0|I do wish the cover was a bit thicker.  The cover sags in the center from the magnetic latch.  If the cover were thicker, it would probably be able to withstand the pressure of the clasp.  Otherwise, a decent cover for your kindle.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|huge improvement over the fiio e7 and for the price, you're getting a great amp. I'm using this to replace my e9+e7 combo.<br /><br />The build quality is also excellent.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Excellent file browser!  Move files from your sd card to your phone's internal sd or connect to your local wifi network and move files from your server with ease.<br /><br />The coolest feature (probably not used very often) -- if you have multiple android devices (and have this software installed) that are all on the same wifi network, you can automatically see all devices from WITHIN ES File Explorer and share files quickly!!!!!!!!!
B005LLSNNE|4.0|The nice thing about SOA is, they get in trouble and you don't.  Nice story and action.  Bikers will really love it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the Report between all of the characters. Their attitudes are so lively .. Show is very fun to watch and watch them interact
B006VRZ5YM|3.0|A slutty girl finally realizes that she needs to stop sleeping around.<br />She acts like she is doing something normal and keeps sleeping with different guys.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|this is one of the most innovative shows and keeps my interest at all times would watch it for years to come
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a well written show with throwbacks to real kindness and a decent way of life.  It will make you wonder why folks think being course and gross is okay today.
B000FBJG04|5.0|It is a wonder how these men rose up and served to keep our freedom. We should be indebted to their contribution, and pray for our soldiers serving today.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can't blow up dirt in  he New update other wise I love it poops<br /><br />I have no.idea but'm log just n it
B004LX0D36|5.0|This was  a 're-read for me and was as pleasing as the first time.  All of Jane Austen's novels are as interesting today as when they were first written.<br /><br /> Indeed they show that basic human nature hasn't changed
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Warning!  The 3D Bluray copy does not contain special features, behind-the-scenes, gag reel, Mariah Carey music video, etc.  It contains the 3D version of the film and only that.<br /><br />Disney Studios, you failed on this release - big time.  In order to receive the special features disc, you must purchase the 2D version of the film for an additional $5.99 PLUS wait for it to arrive in the mail.  I'm sitting at home, excited to play the special features but they are not on my copy even though I paid for the most premium copy of this home release.  What's worse, according to the DIsney Studios support rep I spoke to on the phone... is that people who paid for the cheaper 2D Bluray/DVD combo can purchase the 3D bluray disc for $5.99.  This is a scam and does not add up.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|a very nice book but i am still trying to get hold of this idea that you can have empathy with an electronic book
B001NA6096|3.0|We enjoyed the love story development and the scenes of Europe, especially Veinna.  We think the<br />actors and most of the dialogue was excellent.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Very useful. Found many mornings while traveling that this was used.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|The book did not lack for action, but there were so many characters, and so many sub-plots that I found it hard to keep focused on what was going on. In my humble opinion, this is not his best book.  I loved the camel club and was sure this would be the same quality, but it sounds like an action movie, not a book.
B00AO2T9VU|5.0|This album is better than the others. I am extremely happy with this CD and it came in perfect condition.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Even better than the first season! Must see if you love the first. Can't wait to see the third, although I heard new producer so we'll see.
B0047SIXGE|5.0|Say what you will about this movie, the Vietnam war or war in general, this movie still ranks high in my book of American film-making milestones. I've watched it several times over the years since its release. Each time I watched it I was a little older and I always picked up some new insight that helped my appreciation of what Coppola wanted the viewer to see and understand. This Redux version won't disappoint!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read! Looking forward to the next one! Great cliff hanger<br /> at the end of this one! You can't wait for the next one
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|it's interesting but I wish it would download it won't work because it said the Internet is unstable but I am still trying and it has been two months since I downloaded it<br />but enjoy if it works for you.
B00578EJWA|5.0|OMG! I liked the original Terminator movies, but chonicles go so far beyond that I am sorry I missed it when it was on air.  I like the story line of how and why skynet needs to be destroyed and how sarah, john and cameron go about their business of getting to the super computer and all the little things that happen and get in the way.  I recommend it to anyone who liked the original movie and likes a scify.
B007SXB498|5.0|These novels always seem to begin with trouble between the heroine & the hero, misunderstandings & interference by other characters. Somehow love finds a way to overcome & all ends well.
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|Good movie.  Seen it in 3D at the theatre.  Got this as a b'day gift for a dear friend.  Sadly, Amazon left off the gift note, but he loved it anyway!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This mic was in excellent condition, it worked well. I can really tell the difference in my before and after videos!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I could not put this book down. Each page brought me into the book deeper and deeper. I wish there was more to read but unfortunately the story and the characters came to an end. Adam Makos did an amazing job in writing this book. I highly recommend it to all readers. Thank-you to you and your team for such a wonderful book. I hope there are more to come,
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I can't find anyone to play this game with. So I have no idea how fun this game really is.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|One of QOTSA's best, it definitely exceeded my expectations after Era Vulgaris. This is one of the better albums I've heard in years.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game all the time and would recommend to any one who needs a solitaire game. Thank you.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|One of my very favorite movies of all time.  It's a great family movie and I've never met anyone who didn't enjoy this one.  Love it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|If you expect more than a basic calculator you will be disappointed. If you need a basic calculator, this one works well and has a user friendly setup. It does what it says it will do.

B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I pre-ordered the 3D version, assuming, like EVERY OTHER DISNEY RELEASE, it would have a Regular Blu-Ray Disc, which contained the special features (if not a separate disc, devoted solely to said features).<br /><br />But NO.  They charge us $32 for the 1 3D disc... the SAME PRICE as all their PAST \\"Combo Packs\\" (which include FOUR OR FIVE DISCS!! -- 3d, 2d, bonus, dvd, digital copy; and are often LESS than $32 as well!)<br />ANYWAY, my TV can convert into 2D, should I wish -- but I'm pissed off about not getting the bonus features --- and the fact that they want AN ADDITIONAL $6 (plus shipping, I'm sure), to get what they Normally Include by Default!<br /><br />THIS SHOULD BE A CHOICE OF THE CONSUMER, TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A SINGLE 3D-DISC RELEASE AND A 3D COMBO-PACK RELEASE -- BUT THEY DIDN'T GIVE US THAT OPTION --- AS IT IS, THIS SINGLE 3D-DISC RELEASE SHOULD'VE BEEN AROUND $20, WITH THE (non-existent) 3D COMBO-PACK BEING $32.<br /><br />SO... DISNEY, F*** YOU!<br />BECAUSE ASIDE FROM THE SHEER GREED OF IT ALL... THIS IS YOU TAKING YOUR \\"EDITION\\" B.S TO A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL... SO THAT YOU CAN PUT OUT A PROPER, *FULL RELEASE*, (aka: \\"DIAMOND EDITION\\" or whatever), IN A FEW YEARS, TO TRY & GET US ALL TO BUY IT AGAIN!<br />--- WELL, NOT HAPPENIN' DISNEY!  'CAUSE I'VE HAD IT!<br />--- IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE, EVEN YOU, WOULD S*** ALL OVER YOUR CUSTOMERS LIKE THIS!<br /><br />WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS, SHOULD BE FIRED; AND STEPS TAKEN TO MAKE THIS RIGHT... SINCE WE DID PAY *FULL* \\"COMBO-PACK\\" PRICE, FOR THIS SINGLE-DISC, NO-BONUS-FEATURES, B.S.!!<br /><br />____ UPDATE: ____<br /><br />IF IT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH, THAT WE PAID FAR MORE, FOR FAR LESS.... DISNEY IS ONE-UPPING THE CALAMITY BY GIVING CUSTOMERS 1 FREE TICKET TO \\"The Lone Ranger\\".... IF, YOU BOUGHT THE **LESS EXPENSIVE**, **NON-3D**, BLU-RAY/DVD COMBO PACK!!!!!.... TALK ABOUT ADDING INSULT TO INJURY!!!!!<br />SO... AGAIN... DISNEY, F*** YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />--- (and by the way, how is it even possible, that in this insanely 'politically correct' society, are Indians & Leftists not out in droves, boycotting & picketing that movie!?... Johnny Depp is playing TONTO, with skin-darkened make-up!!!... which, is no different than a white guy putting on \\"black face\\" to play a Black character!!... but, because it's Depp (who's wildly Liberal), the Left is strangely, hypocritically, deafly-silent... kinda how they're that way about the \\"warrant-less wire taps\\" of *suspected terrorists* that they were so opposed to (under Bush), yet they have no problem with far worse warrant-less spying & data-recording, being taken against EVERY American Citizen, At All Times, In All Forms (under Obama)... but I digress...)<br /><br />PS:  YOU DO **NOT** GET THE FREE TICKET, EVEN IF YOU BUY THE $6 (\\"special offer\\") 2D BLU-RAY DISC... WHICH, IF YOU DID, WOULD AT LEAST HAVE YOU \\"save\\" UP TO $2 IN THE END (ticket value *up to* $8) --- HOWEVER, EVEN THE \\"MATINEE\\" (\\"early-bird\\") PRICES AT THEATERS ARE *MORE* THAN $8, IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT IN 3D!!!!!.... YET AGAIN, F*** DISNEY!!!!!!!!!!!
0979019753|5.0|This journal helps you focus on weekly goals and to attain them. I enjoy Hal's daily statements.  Not a lot of room to write, but none the less it keeps me ME on TRACK!
B004PGO25O|3.0|I like, as being an artist, the ideas presented in this book. I truly recommend &#34;The War of Art&#34;, and I should tell you that it's not worthy to buy the other books (related to work and discipline), because he talks about the same concepts, nothing new.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room reminds me of Myst, just not nearly long enough. Lots of fun to play, though. Would like to see the sequel.
0938045695|5.0|This book is easy to read and engages the reader, how to photos are a big help in making sure you get it right.
0062017926|5.0|This book is everything I expected. When I read my first James Rollins book it was Devil Colony. This book has not changed my opinion of Mr. Rollins at all he is a very awesome author.
B005NAE04E|5.0|I loved this story. It's magical and wondrous, with the Gaiman twist, so I didn't quite know what would happen next.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|A deep and fast paced read,it grips and pulls the reader in to the story.Harry Bosch is at his best
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I got this app as a free app of the day, and I must say I immensely enjoy it. The app has many, many different sounds, and while I don't like or regularly listen to them all, I like the variety. My favorite mix thus far is calming down, I listen to that daily. Try out the pre-set favorites I think you'll enjoy them!<br />To be fully honest, while I probably would not buy this app if it wasn't free- I am very glad I did get it. Absolutely no complaints.
B00006G8K0|5.0|All you have to do is watch. This movie was an influence later on John Carpenter.  \\"Heaving breasts and blood\\", yeah baby.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|but gosh this book has it all - the trials and tribulations of relationships, cheating, reconciliation, engagements, surprises, significant jewellery, pregnancy and Angus witnessing something quite spectacular! Eva - you're not the only one totally in love with Gideon. He endears himself to us all in this instalment. Write on, Sylvia Day. LOVING it!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I honestly love this game. And all of the other Flow games for that matter. They're just so addicting!!! Love it!!!!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This movie was even better than I had expected! Can't wait for the 2nd and 3rd parts!! Great Action Adventure!!
B000NY12CI|4.0|This book had too many personal details, some of which I found boring and self serving.<br /><br />The interesting facts it presented about being a Somalian trying to find a home and subsequently about the situation in the Netherlands as regards immigrants was really interesting.It made reading the book interesting to me . I learned a lot.<br /><br />Ayan Hirsi Alli was brave to hold on to her beliefs.At the same time,  I did feel that she was a little egotistical as regards herself. Often this seems to happen in biographies .
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great cast, great story-line and I'm a female lawyer so I enjoy seeing the women lawyers litigate! My go-to show on the Kindle.
B000TO0TB2|1.0|Couldn't figure this one out. It seems that you have to be in the know about Paul Auster to get it.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and was totally mesmerized.  It was very emotional especially if you have children.  It was very intense. My two daughters 14 and 17 saw it with me and they were very upset while watching it.  Just know your children if you watch it with them.  This movie has one of the best scenes I have ever seen in any movie.  I love it!
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|I'm having a hard time getting thought this. I put it down and then find something more interesting to read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its very fun to play but at least once a week it glitches out while I'm doing training or competing.
0345472322|5.0|Very approachable and readable, but also great insight into what helps some people persevere and others not. I recommend you buy it.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I wish I could cook like Julia Child's did, but then again I can watch Food Network all day. I love how this movie was portrayed to its true sense. I can't wait to get my own copy of the cookbook!
B003O3EKII|5.0|I loved the cast of characters and enjoyed watching my grandkids watch it, they have watched it over and over..
0425263924|5.0|There are no words to describe my deep love and devotion to this entire series that Sylvia Day is writing, and yet with this book she has done it again. I didn't believe that Eva could have gotten any stronger and finally believing in the love she and Gideon shares is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have fallen deeper and deeper in love with Gideon and look forward to the rest of the books that are coming out.
0810989956|5.0|I bought this book for my niece. She likes it very much and has asked that I purchase it as a birthday gift for a friend.
B00D2HTRVQ|3.0|Although I didn't pay anything, I would love to have my 199 coins back.  This is really a good game without the ghost.  What does being a handyman have to do with it?  We don't need to give glory to the Devil by having it, so I deleted it from my Kindle
141970642X|5.0|This book is a great for a child. My niece liked it and asked that I purchase another as a gift.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I did not convert any negatives to JPEG on this  equipment but it worked great to convert 35mm slides.  It was much quicker than I anticipated and the quality was very good.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Words can't explain how happy I am with this product..i just love it , I want the episodes over and over  haha
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|it is fun and challenging. Great game to play while having to wait between practices or on long car trips.
B008VBYN80|4.0|fun little game...after lvl 20 kinda gets slow though. should put less diamond requirements for missions. other than that great boredom killer.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Better than playing the original version and all the othes 2. U get 2 find golden fruits on each level. Involves RIO movie characters and villains
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I rarely write reviews, and I should really blame myself for buying this \\"brain junkfood.\\" I sometimes indulge in this genre knowing the writing will not be up to par, but honestly, this is one of the worst books I've read in a long time. I am fighting back my gag reflex every time I turn a page (I have an unhealthy obsession with finishing things I start). There is barely any substance in this book and it seems that every other page is a sex scene and she is always \\"amazed he is hers\\" or she is \\"trying to forget about the circumstances surrounding their relationship\\".<br /><br />In my opinion just save yourself the money and time and find something more entertaining. I'll be done with this genre for a while after this, its like eating really bad junk food, it tastes like crap going down and will put you on a health kick for a LONG time.
1476734941|5.0|The best part is no heavy exercise required and the fast days are spread out so that makes it easier to do - no long term deprivation and there are still results.  Slow going but the other health benefits are definitely a plus.<br />Would recommend to anyone trying to lose weight at a sensible pace.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love app. My family is tired of hearing \\"bingo\\". This app locks up time to time. I still love it. Log in daily to get more bongo bucks.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I've seen all of these movies before, most in actural theaters.  The colors, sound and overall feel really comes alive.  I have a 55&#34; TV these movies all need big screens to really pop out.  A worthwhile investment if you like Indy.
B001Q4YXF2|5.0|The bittersweet dream-like tour you are invited upon will perhaps haunt you as it has touched me.  The &#34;Limited&#34; is especially achingly beautiful.  A trip upon the unreal to reach for some realized emergent inner truth.  And the boys are amazing.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|This is a real sleeper:  first it features a cast of teens playing teens and doing a first rate job.  The story is right out scifi, government, area 51, alien capture, coverup lore.  It's very well done.  I suspect we'll be seeing several of the young actors again.
0679745203|3.0|Bought this hoping to dive deeper in the &#34;mood&#34; of The English Patient.  Found out that the movie surpassed the written word (this time.)  Read about half of it.
B00136Q1XA|5.0|A New World Record Electric Light Orchestra.....classic album, this is a fantastic album from start to finish. I have always heard and liked ELO but now in my mid 40's I appreciate them more.

Keeps on getting better, of course, 5- stars... I just love these movies . From Story wise to stunts- 5- stars
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This game was fun for me and the kids to play.  We had a lot of fun but have not upgraded the full paid version.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I almost didn't purchase \\"The Innocent\\" because the last book of Baldacci's that I read was horrible (The Sixth Man) ....... but I couldn't put this one down.  Not sure if this is the first book featuring Will Robie, but I certainly enjoyed his character.  Macho with a heart.  The Innocent grabbed me from the first page to the last.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing app for you. Everybody should try this app once. Only complaint once made me hit something else. Over all good.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|love this game, verrryyy addictive! My kids love playing it too! The only thing bad would be the lives, I always need more :)
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I have been watching Doctor Who since the late 1970's.  Of course then, you watched it on PBS and it was usually broken down into half hour programs.  I also remembering reading the paper back books in the late 70's and early 80's when the original show was at the height of its popularity before it disappeared for a few years in the States.  So, f you are a Doctor Who fan, you will love this because it is Doctor Who.  You may like it even more than Seasons 1 or 2 because pouty Rose is no longer the main companion although she shows up towards the end of the Season.  The character Donna Noble, although annoying the first time we meet her in &#34;The Runaway Bride&#34; episode, evolves into an interesting companion who is very emotionally vulnerable, caring, kind, funny, and quite intelligent despite the fierce raging persona she displays at first.  Donna becomes an excellent friend for the Doctor and someone who keeps him grounded to if not right the wrongs of the Universe or Universes, at least to &#34;save someone- just someone&#34;.<br />As for David Tenant playing the Doctor, he really comes into his own by this Season.  He seemed very awkward when he first started playing the character but by this Season I am convinced that he is not only the Doctor but he is the only Doctor.  He also displays some excellent acting in the episode &#34;Midnight&#34; along with the actress Lesley Sharp who plays the character Sky Silvestry.  I don't know how the two of them could keep up the dialogue they had going, but WOW.<br />And for those of you who have no idea who or what Doctor Who is, (such as my husband), the 4th Season is confusing but interesting as long as you watch with someone who knows the series and can explain things as they happen.  He especially likes the Daleks because of how cheesy they are - if he only knew how cheesy they use to be.<br />Enjoy..
B00BHMF578|5.0|making up a movie as a cover story is not new (wag the dog), but in this case based on a true story, from something I experienced while in the US Marines....very entertaining and interesting
B00DBSZ6ZC|3.0|Hansel & Gretel Witchhunters- Unrated Cut.<br />I can give this a rating- crappy.<br /> Yes I knew it was an over the top fun romp thru the famous fable.<br />The original fable is gruesome and designed to frighten the begeezus out of children, and parts of this film will certainly do that.<br />The really gnarly parts make one say: Whoa!! They really did that to those children!??<br /> Most scenes are less 'hide your eyes' worthy, and are actually quite comical.<br /> My main problems with this film are the production qualities. At times it just looks crappy. It can be choppy, and out of focus in some scenes.<br />Granted some of this is due to the streaming qualities, but some parts are obvious flaws in tech.<br />Apparently this was meant to be a 3D feature with axes and arrows and blood splats into the camera. Fun actually, but if it is not streamed in a 3d format with glasses or whatever, it just looks like crap.<br />Acting; What's his face, Renner just walks thru this one. Did he film this on days off from Avengers shooting?<br />Gemma Arterton who I saw in Clash of the Titans was very good~! She looks amazingly hot and her acting was nice. I approve!<br />Famke Jannsen- Looks great! Acts like she is enjoying the villain role, which she eats up! Very good.<br />To sum it up; This movie, on the whole, is junk. There are better 'over the top just for the sake of fun'  movies out there.<br />Pass this one.<br />P.S. The sound sucks big-time.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I was lost after the first 5 minutes. The sound quality was terrible and it was hard to understand a lot of the dialogue.
B003SHDRQ6|4.0|Is a good reference of how make more dynamic books, I will said is ok since I have only read a couple of more books on this matter, but I was expecting more examples, and probably a link to some videos of the author working...I look at some of them at Youtube but it will be nice to get an extra videos with the purchase of the book, overall I do recommend this book if you have some knoweldge practice on human figure, it has good concepts that probably would take much longer to understand by myself, it does save my time.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|I thought this was an excellent movie. The subject matter was realistically handled and gave some insight into the world of mental illness.
B002WSASIC|5.0|Great movie! Quality was just as it was when i first saw it in the 90s. Edward Norton is perfect in his role. Perfect description of the troubled times a person experiences when part of a group such as the one in movie.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It does not give accurate information for my kindle HD. I am removing this app and finding something more specific to my kindle
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Enjoy playing everyday. Good social game for bingo with abilities to trade prizes etc enjoy the daily competition. Round and slots.  Have made lots of new friends through this app.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Disapointed, adverts are a real nuisance. Don't like the format. Difficult to use. Will stick to my old way of accessing the site.
B009H1S56O|5.0|I've already done two reviews for other editions of Paradise, but I recently added this edition of the album to my collection, and i have absolutely no regret about doing so. The box set is absolutely beautiful.<br />The box it all comes in is beautiful and sturdy, with embossed gold lettering on the front. They made it to be exactly like a larger version of the album, including track listing on the back, so it feels exactly like such. The interior of the box, as well, is beautifully done and is not just white cardboard, but rather contains a continuation of the black splattered theme seen on the disc, booklet, packaging, etc.<br />The lithographs are done on sturdy paper and are matted, and each of them is beautiful and represents the single well. Especially if you can't get your hands on other Lana collectibles (e.g. picture discs, singles, other vinyls, etc.), these make a great representation of the singles. The pictures themselves are also very high definition. The picture disc of \\"Blue Velvet\\" is beautiful overall. The remix can also be found on the Target edition of the EP, but it's nice to have in such a special and limited format. I must say that they could have added two different images to the respective \\"a\\" and \\"b\\" sides of the album, as is done with most picture discs, rather than keeping the same images for both, but it remains beautiful nonetheless.<br />Then... the album itself. This edition comes with a digipak (paper/ cardboard) packaging of the album which houses the album and the ep in respective slipcases, which makes this packaging special in and of itself. I must say that I do prefer digipaks to jewel cases, and this is no exception. The remix CD and the music video DVD come in respective slipcases with a tracklisting on each. It's nice to have them all packaged separately. The digipak for the album was a little cramped with the booklet, and so I put it in with the remix CD, which had extra space. The remixes themselves are really good (I waskind of hesitant to listen, due to the mediocre nature of the remixes of Blue Velvet on the target edition of the EP, but they proved me wrong)! And of course... the videos are beautiful and the DVD is very well done!<br />Overall... it's a beautiful package. It does focus mostly on Born to Die, with the lithographs and videos and remixes all being from this album, and I would maybe have liked to see more focus on Paradise. But overall, it is absolutely beautiful and well worth the money!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Just finished reading this book. Unlike some of the readers I am glad that the story of Gideon and Eva will continue, but I am dissapointed that I have to wait for the continuation. I wish Ms Day would have written a bigger book just to wrap up the series. Overrall it was a good read. I am glad there was not a lot of them being seperated. I loved how well written all the lovemaking between Eva and Gideon was written. I could pitcure myself there. If this series ends up being a movie please get Henry Cavill to play Gideon. Please hurry up and release the continuation book(s).
B009S33I68|5.0|Growing up in the 1980's, everyone wanted to forget the war.  Therefore,  my generation knows very little about it. This book really helped me to better understand the war and gave me the highest respect for our veterans.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love the characters, Miss Lane and her ability to solve anything. Laura and her innocence but the appearance of being a woman.  Minnie, what a fun character she is and I could go on and on about all of the characters that I have come to know.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I agree completely that it is too short. I loved this game. I also agree with the review that you should use the hints sparingly to make the game last longer. If you like puzzles you will love this game. I can't wait for the next chapter!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|It's not a bad thing, but I found that I didn't like using it as it was rather complicated for  my simple brain.
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|Movie has its moments kept going from high budget spectacle to low budget cheese.  The quality of the movie was all over the place.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I like the music Blake Shelton makes. I like all the songs. Sometimes you buy a full album and only like 3 or 4 songs. Like like like
145210655X|4.0|It's a great sight gag for a father's day gift.  Probably nothing you'd go back to, but quickly funny and charming.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The topic, North Korea, is fascinating in and of itself. But its the writing, woven from a variety of perspectives and time in a nonlinear fashion, that puts this book over the top. You will feel love, loss, hatred, disgust, and everything in between as you are carried through this absolutely brilliant writing.
0553801473|5.0|If you are looking at Book 5 you will know how George RR Martin can enthral the reader as he takes us on this wondrous journey through a world which appears in great chaos, providing drama and mayhem aplenty.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This really could've been an amazing movie and an instant classic. Just fell short. It has all my favorite actors and I wanted to like this movie but just couldn't. I really regretted renting it.
B000SEKNUK|3.0|A little light, but there are good nuggets to be picked up throughout.  I like that there are exercises included - makes it a bit of a workbook
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Liked it but I expected so much more, The look at all 3 religions was interesting some of the shots was amazing. But the story lacked something couldn't tell you just was expecting more.
B009WJ3HY6|5.0|This is a live performance the night after the famous &#34;Live At Leeds&#34; was recorded. This set is equally as good. A must have for Who fans. It doesn't get any better than this!
B004EF65QA|5.0|It was amazing.  Too bad they didn't continue filming more episodes. A great way to spend the evening. We'd watch it again.
B00B0C6T34|5.0|Another great Swing Out Sister collection. Great alternate takes of various SOS favorites. A must have for any fan young or old!
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Great movie! ...made a grown man cry! I have added this movie to my favorite movies collection. Very believeable story !
0765337541|5.0|I gave a copy of Ender's Game to a friend of mine who is a clinical psychologist specializing in child development, and he told me later that the author seemed to have rather a profound insight into the minds of children, and he was also surprised that several colleagues to whom he recommended the book had already read it. I came to the book via my son, to whom I had given a copy of Asimov's Foundation when he was very young. He passed along Ender's Game one Father's Day, with the comment that I should be sure to read Card's Introduction, in which Foudation plays a part. I have to say that this book, written before the advent of Internet online gaming, really saw the future in a most remarkable way. The story is intriguing for it's portrayal of a boy caught in a world not of his making who has been breed to save it. His interactions with his siblings and adult controllers is the stuff of twenty first century Holden Caulfields. Be sure to read this before you see the movie, as nuance and Ender's introspection is sure to be lost.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great app. Very easy to use. Would highly recommend this app.  Navigation is easy and this app is very helpful.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for the next book this one went buy way to quick<br />Ending sucked<br />Now I have to wait
B00B4804KS|4.0|I wanted to watch this at the movies again as I love this movie.  Growing up I was a dinosaur freak and I still love them, and this movie brought them to life for me.  I waited to buy it and watch it at home in 3D.<br /><br />Love the movie in HD, loved it even more in 3D. Specially the scences with the raptors, they had the wife freaked out.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|My husband really wanted this movie,He loved it thow nit was very long...but said it was a very good movie
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|The movie is ok funny.  Story is much like first one in a different setting.  They took the disgusting parts and raised them 5 levels (which are pretty nasty).  It has its funny moments.  I recommend, renting it.  I bought it to collect, didn't paid much but I don't suggest buying.
B00C5W3SBE|2.0|Poor story line. Flat acting .Sorry I bought this.I do have to say that the special effects were fair.<br />You might want to wait for it to come to local stations to see.
B005LAII80|4.0|While I am not a Dredd comic book reader, nor have I seen the Stallone version. I did enjoy this movie. The action is great, but, I can say that it lacks some speed. This is the type of movie that you want the action to be heart pounding and fast. That said, I don't think the length and storyline could've support that pace. So the pace follows the length of the story.<br /><br />I watched it in 3D at home, which is great. There are some scences that show great depth and distance. There isn't too much pop-out effects, but I'm not into that personally (maybe once per movie is fine).<br /><br />I can recommend for people to buy or rent. I bought it at ~$15 and never watched it prior to purchase, I don't regret spending the money.
0765325950|5.0|This was a gift for my son's birthday and he was so happy and I saw the quality of the book and it was as promised, like new. He was happy and so was I!
B007MNV5WU|2.0|First of all, I shouldn't complain, because I got it free.  But this version is no where near the level of fun the previous Birds were.  The gravity thing is just annoying.  And the screen is so crowded with ads and other graphics that you can barely see what you're aiming at.<br />DON'T PAY FOR THIS.  If it's free, then try it.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I found this a powerful and moving story of the hardships of family life in Kabul and then on to Paris, San Francisco and Greece. Well worth reading.
0061122416|3.0|Not my typical type of reading. I didn't like it as much as I wanted to given the reviews I had read from others who recommended the book.  Makes you think about your life’s purpose or “Personal Legend” and what you are willing to do to realize it or remain complacent with what you have.  Sometimes we are given signs or omens and not sure how to interpret – if we should make a choice or continue on the same course.  And also that sometimes what you are looking for is right under your nose but you have to go through a lot of trials and tribulations to find and appreciate the treasure you have. (kind of like the Wizard of Oz, but most literary critics would probably tell me I’m crazy) Anyway, I enjoyed the authors writing style and story telling and it was an easy read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is hands down one of the best all-time favorites. It is captivating, suspenseful, and romantic. I fell in love with all of the characters and looked forward to every minute I spent with them. I will remember my journey through Safe Haven for years to come.
B00BESM14U|4.0|I resisted this movie about underdogs coming of age. I mean, haven't we all seen that story a thousand times already, I thought (and was wrong) No, I haven't. Chances are, you haven't either. Perks of being, etc.. is a smart, hilarious yet moving and, yes at times somewhat sobering look at the life of a bright, but troubled young man who makes some very unusual friends. (spoiler) Despite the movies dark turn toward the end, he does eventually resolve his lifelong trauma and learns that he is loved, and that it is perfectly okay to be yourself. I laughed, I cried and I let myself feel something. Worth it. Was on the fence between 4 and 5 stars ONLY because I tend to avoid drama featuring troubled youth. The cast and their delivery of the subject matter was worth at least 4.5 stars, but that big 5 (in MY rating system, this IS my review you know.) rating is reserved for things that COMPLETELY lifted my soul. Perks hit a little close to home for me, and I can say I loved it, I would NOT casually recommend it. It isn't a casual movie. Not a bad thing at all. So well done and definitely worth a watch.
B001BKG9SA|5.0|One of the best David Gilmour albums ever.  I play it again and again.  The music is so relaxing.  It is a must have.
B00177YA1K|5.0|Love both actors - they do these rolls very well and show how versatile they can be. Will Smith has come a long way from &#34;Prince of Bel-Air&#34;.
B00BUNQOOM|5.0|As a long time Del Lords fan, I was very excited when I heard they were releasing a new album.  I'm pleased to say it was well worth the long wait.  \\"Elvis Club\\" is an album full of rootsy, back to basics rock & roll, pairing excellent musicianship with songwriting that is gritty, catchy, and smart.  The songs throughout the album address current issues and the struggles many of us face daily in a way that makes you feel less alone.  Scott Kempner is an extraordinary songwriter and performer, seamlessly blending elements of rockabilly, true country, and pure rock & roll.  This organic mix of styles enables the Del Lords to musically express emotions not always easily translated and is especially powerful when coupled with lyrics that touch on the harshness of life without ever losing a sense of humour.  A personal favourite sharp turn of phrase included on this album is from the standout song \\"Me and the Lord Blues\\"--\\"No food on my table, too much on my plate\\", which is also a good example of the depth and intelligence of the lyrics contained on the entirety of \\"Elvis Club\\".  Some of my other favourite tracks on here include \\"Silverlake\\", \\"You Can Make A Mistake Only One Time\\", and a fantastic cover of Neil Young's \\"Southern Pacific\\".  \\"Elvis Club\\" is an album that is not only a welcome return for the Del Lords, but an album that I find myself listening to often since its release and getting more out of it with each listen.  I think any music fan looking for an album full of deep songs, both lyrically & musically, will definitely appreciate this album.  Very highly recommended.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I love this app! I did not purchase the pro version yet, but this version is quite helpful. You can switch a world from creative to survival, move your player or spawn, and add hundreds of items to your inventory. I don't know what the pro version does differently, but I'm sure it's even better.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME WHAT A WONDERFUL GAME TO HAVE AND PLAY. THE GRAPHICS ARE TERRIFIC. I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY THIS GAME. I WAS VERY LUCKY TO GET THIS GAME FOR ONLY 99&cent; BECAUSE IT WAS ON SALE. BUT THE GAMEPLAY IS FANTASTIC U CAN ALWAYS GO ON YOUTUBE TO LOOK AT THE GAMEPLAY
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I Loved this whole series. It has been a real page turner. I feel as though I really knew the whole Clifton family!
B004UID2LC|2.0|Maybe I am spoiled because of the great app for youtube on iphone but this sucks. I don'<br />t see a way to sign into my account and constantly have to look up stuff on my iphone and then look up on kindle. The only thing I did like was that you can download youtube videos but really how many people are going to do that. Could use improvements.
B008EKOIN8|2.0|Loved all his previous books. This is more same ole same ole, cook book stuff.<br />Not groundbreaking insights as he usually provides. A filler for the contract.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Just love this game and I am so glad I can play it no matter if I am on the iphone or the Kindle.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Readers will again be impressed by Theo. Boone, cub attorney.  This middle school kid impresses both adults and peers with his background in law. He even has his own little law office. In Grisham's third book, Theo actually tangles with local, state, and federal officials (he call them thugs) over property rights, or eminent domain, regarding a by-pass. Theo believes that they are in it for the money. This book is not only a great read, it is also informative.<br /><br />Read the first two Theodore Boone novels to get solid background on this precocious kid lawyer. I'd want him to go to bat for me!
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|This movie was something my wife picked out, she loves English movies and she picked this hoping for a good one.  This movie was horrible!  Hard to follow, everything ends up being on a stage?  Save your money!
B003DNN0L2|5.0|First saw this on a plane ride and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  I purchased it for my wife and I to watch together and we both love it.  It's great for kids, but adults will enjoy it too.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I have been trying to play the game but it just blacks out. I was really looking forward to the game. :-( please fix it
193700788X|5.0|Great ending to the series I really enjoyed how Charlaine took Sookie to a conclusion that worked for me, and tied up a lot of other loose ends.  I can't really remember books 11 & 12 I still think I did not read them but maybe I did but did not enjoy much.  It was hard reading the book and not thinking about the tv series and trying to figure out where were are in the story line but I enjoyed it very much.
B000002WPI|5.0|This only really needs one word but since amazon forces me to use 20 I'll say this sound rugged rough tough and dangerous it is scary to listen how good this album is
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Very interested format, but sometimes it was difficult to figure out which character was speaking.  Khaled Hosseini is a very talented writer, but if you are looking for a book as engaging as &#34;Kite Runner&#34;, you may be disappointed.  But still worth the time to read about the culture and the characters.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I was very best pleased with the dvds that I received and would recommend this to someone else gladly... wow
B00992CF6W|5.0|The greatest in my opinion but games like avp evolution cannot be beat. if you want try to beat my diamond score.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Very good book. Fast read...just a bad ending...the ending was fast and left nothing to wonder about...unlike the first two books.
1567184855|5.0|I've had a lifetime of unusual experiences and 'visitations', and this book documents our lives 'in-between' in a way that makes sense according to my own experiences.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|They were very easy to hook up..  Well built. I would recommend these to anyone looking to hook their surround sound systems. Cheers.
B000O76VBG|4.0|My 8 month old loves her teether keys! She enjoys the sounds it makes and that she can chew all over it!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a really fun game I enjoy it very fun. It is like you are the king of your own country.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I did this workout once, so far and really enjoyed it. I like that it's a fast paced, 20 minute dvd. I felt sore the next day, but it felt good!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This a really well done series that offers a view of a society that we are all familiar with but do know in detail.  Great job History Channel!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a amazing book I couldn't stop reading! So much detail<br />A little bit of everything, romance, trill and twists and turns!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it but annoyed at one of the actors and his big head that lead to the story changing. Stupid hollywood.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book was amazingly spectacularly awesome. Jace is so amazing, I am hoping he and Clary work out. I HIGHLY recommend this book series.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|The &#34;work&#34; as a whole was very entertaining, well made with excellent casting, Their performances were stellar!<br />  For me it was about a battle that has raged on since the beginning of time, the heart versus the brain and all that it encompasses. The best laid plans of Mice and Men (Women too!) are no match for the heart, it has and will continue to prevail.
B008133MDK|5.0|Great writing, great acting, and very captivating.  This by far, is the best Sherlock, and Dr. Watson.  I only wish there were more seasons.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|All in all, I very well done and powerful movie.  Worth a look, especially the first half of the film.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is the finest of TV.  I have watched many versions of Sherlock and this is the best writing and  bringing it into the 21st Century is also brilliant.  Sherlock and Dr. Watson are so perfect in their roles.  If you like mystery, this simply is the best
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great app but sometimes you get board and won a download a different app still good game nice graphics I even leveled up on one day now I just wach youtube I need a better life
B009XIXVU6|5.0|All about family, hard choices caused by dire circumstances, heartbreak, enduring love, strength of family ties, sense of unknown losses, survival and enduring hope.  Universal human emotions.
0615782043|5.0|G.P.A is the truth!! his words touches you in all the right places. a definitely a must read.. One click right now!!!...
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I started by reading a sample and the next thing I know I'm immersed in this story and barely come up for air. Overall, I'm a sucker for good writing and smart conversation. Throw a winning storyline in there...and I'm sold.<br /><br />I had a few minor issues that prevented me from issuing  5 star status.  Hazel Grace and Augustus are way too wise for their young years (which I loved), and while I mostly enjoyed the banter, the forced use of the teenage filler \\"like\\" ruined it for me in several scenes. I enjoyed the supporting cast (except for Kaitlyn).  She was a throw-away filler character for me. Finally, I understand why the book ends the way it does, but I wanted more closure!! Frustrating!!<br /><br />Overall, a quick paced, thought-provoking honest journey of love and terminal illness through the eyes of some wise teenagers. Worth reading.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series took a bit of determination to see though the first few episodes because of the large number of characters introduced, but it is worth it.  Season 2 gets even better.
1594204217|4.0|We really enjoyed the approach Michael Pollan takes on food and food preparation. This is a must read for home chefs.
B0047VSW30|5.0|This was a great movie, it showed a transitional period in our human history where superstition and confusion ruled the world. Religion as usual was blind and sacrificed a scientist, a woman, and a common sense situation without any reason or explanation. Sad but true. I made my 11 year old son watch so he could understand better why hostility rules the world of any religion.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|In my humble opinion, if you truly enjoy the slow trudge of Black Sabbath's original six albums, you will enjoy this.  Period.  It SOUNDS and FEELS like 1970's, old school, Ozzy fronted Sabbath.  You've even got Ozzy on harmonica like \\"The Wizard\\" back in the day!  Awesome!  The songs on here range from very good to outstanding with End of the Beginning, God is Dead?, and Age of Reason being my favorites. Iommi has a guitar solo at the end of Age of Reason that will absolutely melt your face and give you goosebumps...I know it did for me!<br />Although I've always liked the more upbeat style of Ozzy solo better (blasphemy!), I've always really liked Sabbath in small chunks, which is exactly how I've enjoyed this album,  I listen to 4 songs driving here...the next 4 there...etc.  In the end, though, if you truly get into old-school, Ozzy-fronted Sabbath (and not just the hits like Paranoid and Iron Man), you will love this...because that's what it IS.  SABBATH!  The Best Buy bonus version is a worthwhile buy, btw, because it's got a second disc with 4 extra songs, all of which are good and are a bit faster paced and shorter than the main disc.<br />Anyway, I've given this CD a few days to grow on me and it has. Big Time! Be careful, though.  If you're new to Sabbath and you think the godfathers of Metal blaze along like Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, etc...you may be disappointed.  If you go in understanding that Sabbath prefers to slowly pulverize you with a sledgehammer...you'll enjoy it.  This IS Black Sabbath.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Easy to read with excellent presentation of concepts to support good health, weight loss, and a positive life style through self care in food consumption.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Surprise on me ... I thought this was going to be the last book in the series but once I finished this one I learned there is more to be said and there is and I can't wait.  I love the Crossfire Series and feel it is every bit as good as Fifty Shades or even better.  It was sizzling hot with passion, love, more angst, and just great writing and characters.  You feel like you are living it.  I did get a bit exasperated with Eva at times in doing things such as seeing her old boyfriend when she should have said no but she wasn't really doing anything wrong.  Oh why can't there be any Gideon's in the real world!  Don't pass this up despite what some of the reviewers said.  I loved it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's the best show I've ever seen this side of Battlestar Galactica. If you havn't seen it you owe yourself this experience.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a simple game that requires nothing if you like to flip your vehicle - and that can be fun!  But if you want to complete levels, you need to upgrade your vehicle engine, or suspension, or tires, or 4WD.  And you must navigate the course using only a gas pedal and a brake...it isn't as easy as it sounds!  Try it!  But not at work...you won't get anything else done!<br /><br />One bad comment...you must purchase game/coins to go beyond the basics.  I get annoyed by \\"free\\" apps that aren't really free.  But the free game is all I play and it is fun.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After playing this game long enough to have four stage choices with various levels completed in each - I realize that I am still playing the free game and it is possible to enjoy this game without spending real money.  Just drive and drive and collect those game coins!  The upgrades, purchased with game coins, are great and very helpful!  Hint:  I find upgrading my tires to ALWAYS be helpful - I am now at maximum tires!  I like this game a lot - very distracting for those times when you need to be distracted!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|very enjoyable reading. the characters were engaging and the story line interesting and enjoyable. brought a tear to my eyes.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|What a great story about abandonment and the root of evil. I find it interesting that this sorry is often retold portraying Frankenstein's creation as an evil monster from the beginning when in fact at his genesis he was a loving creature in a hideous form. Human nature's inability to look past his appearance and see the personality and love within filled him with rage and the feeling of betrayal. I think a lot can be learned from the book and how we treat each other but unfortunately it is often passed off as a horror story.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was by far one of the best out of the crossfire series!  Every page left me wanting more. I can't wait to see what is in store next for Gideon and Eva !
B00899F0G8|4.0|great season! Love these Pretty Liars<br />Love the hair, makeup and clothes<br />I love the character changes and how they have evolved
B005I548B4|3.0|I love Nicholas Sparks novels but this is definitely not one of his better ones. I would call it a pleasant read for a rainy day
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|If you are a fan of the Eagles or just good ole classic rock this is for you. The language is a little rough so I wouldn't recommend for children.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is fun but I have had problems updating it on my kindle fire please fix it besides that it is amazing
B0095P31L6|5.0|I down loaded it for my grand daughter and watched it before she got here.  I got a lot of laughs, but the best part was that the &#34;hero&#34; was very humble and refused the violence when the normal film logic was to take the chance.  In the point alone I thought it was worth my time.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a good little puzzle game to waste some time with trying to figure out all the solutions. I got it for free, but would pay $1 for it any day
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Good read. So horrible of a life this young man had. Inhumane. A must read. Kept my interest the whole time.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Since I have started using my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 camera, I wonder why I waited so long to download it. The pictures are so crystal clear and show more details than my $450.00 Cannon Camera. The use of it is extremely easy and I can import the pictures to my laptop with ease. Since I have my Kindle Fire HD with me at all times, I can take a picture anywhere and not bring along something else.<br />Many times I have been somewhere and said, &#34;Oh, I wish I had remembered to bring my camera&#34;, now it is right there with me. I am having a lot of fun with finding out the best way to be of use to me.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was an excellent book addressing the old question of nature vs nurture.  The characters were well developed and empathy came easily.  I did find the mixture of questions and responses of the current trial and Q&A from a later grand jury confusing.  The twists of the plot were unexpected and well done.  I found myself questioning how far I would go to protect my family.  At the end of this heart-wrenching tale, I found I needed something light to read.
B00BF11STU|2.0|I found this movie to be very repetitive with not a lot of action. In the first hour there was so much torture of the captives that I actually felt bad and had to stop watching it. I never did get to the part where &#34;The Navy Seals&#34; went into the Compound, had a helicopter crash and captured their &#34;Target&#34;.<br />I prefer that someone might hint at torture, hear some things in the background and allow me to use my imagination. I thought at one point I may need to use some suggestive powers to tell the writers to &#34;move it along, I don't need to see you torture the same men using the same techniques again&#34;. But, instead I turned it off.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Th writing was great, but the story was too slow, plodding at times weighted down with too many 'internal dialogues. The best part was towards the end.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Amazingly done. I can not wait for the second chapter. Easily worth more than $2.00. Love it. I just wish it was longer.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Being that the book was incredible and the film closely followed the book, it would make sense that the film was also incredible.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|This is a very fun game. It is easy to learn. The virtual on screen controller is neat to use. The game play progress is very fun, starting out relatively easy buy getting extremely difficult but the last level.
0446547573|5.0|an amazing story that you can feel involved in, every chapter sucks you in more and more. one of the best books I've ever read
B0000E6I1J|3.0|It was supposed to be new and the cover was all scratched up.  I did not buy a used CD so I am not happy with my purchase.
B00A0ABQLM|3.0|Does what its supposed to on a PC.  Bought three of them and one was for someone with a Mac who has not been able to get it to work.
1596912863|5.0|I loved reading it and I'm so excited for the movie coming out in August.<br />It's a fun book!! Yeah!
1591845556|5.0|There are lots of self-improvement books out there. Which ones should you prioritize?<br /><br />My guess is that Kaufman's book should be near the top of your list, since it shows you how to achieve all the other improvements on your to-do list *more efficiently*.<br /><br />Not everyone who reads Kaufman's book will succeed in life, but those who were going to succeed anyway will probably get their faster as a result of reading it.<br /><br />I've read hundreds of self-help books. Most of them are pure gimmick, with no grounding at all in the scientific literature on self-help (for an overview, read 'Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st Century'). To be sure, there hasn't been a large randomized controlled trial demonstrating that Kaufman's method works, but his method *is* a fairly reasonable inference from the RCTs that *have* been done in psychology and related fields, since each *piece* of Kaufman's program is pretty well-supported in the scientific literature.<br /><br />Kaufman's chapters on how he applied his method to acquire a wide variety of new skills are particularly helpful because they are so concrete and specific.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I enjoyed and appreciated all the characters in this book.  The story was well written but I thought the very end was a bit \\"cheesy\\". I can't picture money buying Lou happiness.
B008JFUNYG|4.0|Before seeing this movie I expected a suspenseful movie with lots of gore on the side and was about 80% right.  There wasn't enough suspense but there were some parts where there absolutely was, such as the ending which was the best thing about the movie. The acting was pretty good and loved the idea of how they went to the cabin to help Mia out with her drug addiction and not just to party, get drunk and get killed while having sex like any other slasher movie. The siblings bonding made it more emotional than the original to me since it was more real. The gore was actually pretty good, it was hilarious at parts and just gross as it can get. I think the highlight of the movie was the ending, I went to the theaters twice just to see the ending again, it was without a doubt amazing and succeeded the original. Remember people, it was not a remake but a new vision towards the story which we can say it was totally different. The movie, besides the lack of suspense hence me giving it 4 stars, was one of the best horror movies out there and totally enjoyable. With its own cliches it still succeeds many crappy horror flicks in years.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I definitely expected this final book to come to a close this way.  I wish it weren't over.  It's been a wonderful journey!
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This is a fresh new Fantasy series with very thought out powers. If your into fantasy I would read all of Brandon Sanderson books
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Look forward to the next book :) i was hooked on the first book. I couldn't put my kindle down
B0050SYS5A|1.0|this item greatly restricts the amount of light going to the sensor.. It did not work for me at all.
B003VANOFY|3.0|The headphones sound okay and the audio quality is okay. They often have trouble connecting to my computer via the wireless USB receiver. The battery life is pretty good at about 6 hours. Logitech needs to update the drivers so it has less trouble connecting to the computer.
B0015WJBR0|5.0|There is a reason for all the great reviews.  Fans of pop and prog alike will find many rewards here.  Moon Safari certainly brings to mind the Beach Boys and Yes, mixing close harmonies with unusual time signatures and dreamy lyrics about nature, life, love, death, and eternity.  \\"[blomljud]\\" is their best effort (as of this writing).  Unlike their first album which is endearing but not tight enough, or their third which is a bit too polished and pop for my tastes, this one is \\"just right.\\"  I want to sing and hum along, dance around the room, cry, smile, shout -- and listen again.<br /><br />Simon Åkesson has a strong and beautiful voice.  He is also a great choral arranger, as evidenced from the first notes of the opening track \\"Constant Bloom,\\" to the a cappella middle section of bassist Johan Westerlund's multifaceted \\"Bluebells,\\" right through to the closing meditative postscript, \\"To Sail Beyond the Sunset.\\"  Petter Sandström writes most of the lyrics and sings even more than Åkesson, and all members contribute backing vocals.  With three different lead singers and principal writers, the album offers good variety over its eleven tracks.<br /><br />Musical and lyrical themes recur throughout, in the manner of the best concept albums, yet without any true \\"reprises.\\"  The lyrics have spirit and love in them, at times cynically commenting on the theme of man vs nature as in the phenomenal, 15+ minute \\"Methuselah's Children,\\" one of many highlights.  Diehard proggers will be drawn to the 31+ minute multi-part sprawl of \\"Other Half of the Sky,\\" and rightly so.  It alone moves through several moods, with loads of recurring motifs, and ends revealing the meaning of life.  My favorite track is most certainly \\"The Ghost of Flowers Past,\\" a \\"Wuthering Heights\\"-style love story which closes the first CD.  Here Åkesson gives it all he's got, from the pleading, Eric Carmen-influenced beginning section to the full-on, high-pitched final note, which he holds for so longit takes my breath away every time.  Wow!<br /><br />But as others have said, there are no weak tracks here, from Sandström's jaunty and gentle \\"In the Countryside,\\" to the frenzied bacchanal \\"Lady of the Woodlands\\" (which clearly recalls Styx's \\"Sing for the Day\\"), to the early Springsteen-influenced \\"Yasgur's Farm.\\"  \\"Moonwalk,\\" an instrumental comprised largely of other songs' themes a la the title track from \\"Quadrophenia,\\" brilliantly takes the listener on a musical journey through the stages of a lunar space mission, and uses recordings from Apollo VIII astronauts to send an uplifting message.  Even the calm and eerie \\"Tale of Three and Tree\\" is welcome, if unspectacular.<br /><br />It's really great to hear how much five young men from Skellefteå, Sweden were able to pack into 100 minutes of music.  Earnest, fun, funny, beautiful, poignant, rocking, one can't be unmoved listening to \\"[blomljud].\\"  Not to be missed.
0345803485|4.0|I bought this book for my wife.  She wanted to see what all the hype was about.  Needless to say I think I received a huge benefit from the book as well ;)  Thank you E L James, the bedroom hasn't been the same.  Guys, I recommend that you get this book for your wife or girlfriend or both... if they get into it (like mine did) then be sure to get your rest and eat healthy... you're going to need it.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This show is so well written and acted. It is fascinating and I can't stop watching it! Looking forward to season 4!
B004H6G0TI|5.0|This is the best plane app I have seen. My entire family loves it. there are tons of different types of planes with all different kinds of weapons. You fly around shooting other planes down very fun. I was worried about violence, but compared to games like call of duty this app is extremely childish.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The Language of flowers is a charming and intriguing story. The main themes are motherhood, love and flowers, with flowers being the thread that ties characters and events together. This book was an excellent book club selection.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|My son(4) loves this movie. It has humor for the whole family. My son also loved the music he dances through all the credits every time!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Even though I was born in the mid 80's, this was an excellent story. The kind of story that keeps you up into the early morning reading. The kind of story that makes you think, hey I can write a novel... If only I had the same kind of dedication and humor towards one singular idea that Ernest Cline has. Well... I'm screwed! I hope he comes out with another book that is just as exciting and unexpected as this one.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|More for older kids or a kid who is very advanced when it comes to focus and ability to understand complex gameplay. The first few bridges are easy but after that my son (4) lost interest because they became to complex for him to complete in a short amount of time.
B000001FN1|5.0|Best albom of Warlock. Good quality CD. But i don't see what music label made this CD. But CD have best sound quality.
B00AHSF4AQ|5.0|I love this movie, to me it is one of the classics, there is just enough humor for kids and adults so everyone can enjoy watching it together.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so much fun! It's clever, and it keeps your mind guessing. It's also a bit challenging!!! Super awesomeness
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I've owned this version for a few months now and enjoy it more each time I view it. I think it does a better job of explaining the growing regard between Rochester and Jane than the version I owned previously, that of Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark. That version brought to a head the continued existence of Grace Poole in the household, but then never deals with it in a satisfactory manner. Jane appears to cave on the issue, apparently because she loves Rochester, but that's something she hasn't done before because, supposedly, it isn't part of her character.<br />So I read the book and found that the author didn't make an issue of it either.  Perhaps, then, the screenwriter of that version boxed them self into a corner. Whatever!<br />Anyway, I enjoy this version very much and the location scenery is authentic looking and gorgeous.

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I stumbled across courtney Milan via a free kindle ebook prequel to The Duchess War, and fell in love with her unusual but compelling characters. Now I am scouring libraries and amazon for all she has available in print! It's been a long time since I have made a concerted effort to exhaust every work an author has had published.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is not only fun but all my kids love it too. I have a 4, 14, and 16 year old, add my wife and I and we have fun for hours just taking turns. Great for all ages.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I wish I could give a longer review of this book, but I'm about to buy the next one!  :)
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I rated this book four stars because it really makes you think about what's more important in life. Although it made me feel like there was something mentally wrong with Charlie but it didn't say what. It made me somewhat confused which is why I didn't give it the full five stars. All in all it was a very good book and I enjoyed it very much. I would recommend most people to read it.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|This is a good looking app with a nice layout. The information it provides is usless. Everything is already in the settings of Android. It does not accurately give the remaining time, so I don't know why it is even there. It was free so I'm uninstalling it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The new version is great but I can't find the peaceful mode button... so the update isn't very good. The have buckets of water and lava, also spawn eggs

B008D36INE|2.0|Very slow and boring.  I actually couldn't stay awake for it.  I probably would never recommend it to anyone.  Peace.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show depicts a little of what it was like back in the day when LAPD got its bad reputation and LA gangs were growing at an alarming rate.  What I like  is that it gives a slight idea to the viewer of what the people in that area deal with, whether they be cop or criminal.  Mature Audiences 17+ only.
B0011Z76RS|5.0|Excellent But u already know that. The bonus material is worth the purchase. Amazon is the best for mp3 purchases
B001LF347E|3.0|Ok, so I wasn't crazy about the first season of this show.  It seemed like the same thing happened every episode.  The visual affects were terrible.  But it was still somewhat entertaining.<br /><br />BUT KEEP WATCHING.  If you can get through season one.  Merlin will be your favorite show!  Season two is about 100x better than season one!
B00ANAC32U|1.0|This bumpers was initially great and the fit was perfect! It raised the phone a little off any surface while lying down as to prevent scratching and made it easier to grip.<br />However, despite the \\"high\\" price for this piece of plastic/rubber it started cracking after only a couple of months. It's obviously a design flaw but Google isn't doing anything about it since it's out of the 14 day return period.<br />The flaw is in how the plastic is molded around the micro usb port. There's an area with very thin plastic and it tends to crack in the middle of it, rendering the whole bumper useless.<br /><br />To sum it up, looks good and fits snugly for the first little while but with questionable quality it's not made to last more than a month or two. Save your money and buy something else to protect your phone. If there was anything else available when I bought my phone I would have bought it instead.<br />Do a google search on \\"nexus 4 bumper cracked\\" and you'll see what I'm talking about. There's a discussion on a google forum as well as over at xda developers.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|the colors, graphics and fish are gorgeous. It's just a really sweet, fun game to play. I get annoyed that the easiest way to progress is to spend money, but what can you do.

B002ZG99QS|3.0|i mean it was fine i did like the movie but at least i was expecting a little bit more for all the hype that was surrounded by the movie
B00455IVHU|5.0|Excellent!!!!!!  Incredibly well acted and believable!  Great chemistry together! I could watch this over and over again. Highly recommend this movie!
B004SBQAN8|4.0|The typical stuff that i saw on the trailers kind of led me on to see what kind of movie it was. it was okay
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This story just keeps getting better and better.  I can't wait for the next book.  Gideon is great, you fall in love with him.
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|I enjoy each character in the movie series.  I think they play an excellent character role. The movie feels as if you are in the movie.
B006PTNQGU|5.0|This movie came out when I was a little kid. To this day, I still love it. It's great for all ages. Every child wonders what it would be like to be the \\"richest kid in the world\\" and this movie delivers. Can be a little cheesy at times, but still a great film. Would definitely recommend!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I found it addicting the first couple weeks, and I had to google how to do sertain things. overal the game is fun.
B005Z6YHEY|5.0|This book has opened my eyes to the immense plasticity and possibilities of our brains. I was moved to tears by the example in the first chapter of the woman who had been completely incapacitated for years by a lack of balance due to a previous, unrelated treatment and had been told to go home and deal with it. In her first session with an experimental scientist, she could stand unassisted. The book continues the way it starts, with the most miraculous and amazing examples of people who had been given up by mainstream medicine, making full recoveries or incredible rehabilitation improvements. I recommend this book to my biology, education and nursing students as an example of our fantastic capacity to adapt and not to take current knowledge as an end.
B00BTHWFBK|1.0|Am I the only one who found this album completely boring? It really is atrocious from the beginning to the final cut. As usual the \\"Zen Beard\\" screwed the production up and over compressed the album making it unlistenable at higher levels just like Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\" album. The band sounds tired. Very tired. Credit to Tony Iommi for attempting to perfom his best while going through Chemo, I've seen what it does and its very painful to recover from. They should've just waited for Iommi to fully recover and go on nostalgia tours like The Rolling Stones cause' right now, thats exactly what they sound like...a nostalgic act.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I thought this was an entertaining movie. If you like James Bond movies then I believe you will like this movie as well. I also thought the story this movie had was good and was not difficult to follow. I would recommend this movie to others.
B0045XGRQE|4.0|We go this streamed to us as we were prepping to see the new Iron Man 3. Great fun! The Amazon streaming service is so much better than the alternatives.

B006LSZECO|1.0|This book has been on every website and blog that I have read for months and months. A lot of the things that were said about it are correct: It is beautifully written, it will keep you guessing, and it is truly intriguing. The feeling that I had at the end of the book was one of revulsion. The characters are realistically scary in that I don't want to live in a world with people like them.
B005CGI3ZG|3.0|I read many reviews about this collection, and I have to agree with everyone on two facts...The price is right, and the packaging sucks.  I examined all the disks when I received this order, and put each disk in it's own separate paper sleeve...So the original box that the disks were packaged in is basically worthless, but, for the price of this collection, it's worth it.  None of the disks were damaged (I got very lucky there), although the original packaging leaves much to be desired...
B001ANSSDC|3.0|After all of the hype about this book, I was expecting...more. It is well-written, and the plot line is interesting. My problem with this book was with the characters. They didn't seem real or likable to me. I truly wanted to like them, and to root for them, but in the end, I just didn't care.
B00B2DGYQS|5.0|This was a beautiful film with the sensitive handling of a slightly older and heavier man who is sad and depressed until he meets someone who appreciates him.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Love this app.  Tried other battery apps but this is the best.  Simple and easy to use.  Like that the battery percentage remaining can be displayed in the notification bar.  One quick look and you know how much is left.  Great app!!
B0000AUHPK|3.0|I have seen a better version of 'Wiuthering Heights' than this one on free to air TV some months ago. I felt there was not enough enphasis placed on Cathy and Heathcliff's childhood when they exp;lored and learned to love the moors together In this version. I felt Jullette Binoche was almost too pretty to be Cathy as I had imagined her. However, Ralph Fiennes was a believeable Heathcliff and the supporting cast comendable. Sets and costimes were excellent, though more could have ben shown of the bleakness of the moors. This version depended quite a lot of the audience having read the book, but did not really achieved a 'stand alone' version.<br /><br />Dale HALNAN
B004132HZS|5.0|wonderful, enlightening, and a great Dr. Watson as well.  Thouroughly enjoyble.  it was well worth it.  now 3 words required
B0091REZMW|1.0|I try to play this on a brand new kindle fire HD, less than three months old, and nothing works. There is absolutely nothing wrong with my touch screen yet I can't get past the second or third mission and I'm unable to tap into the living room after I find the tea cup. I tried deleting the app and then 're downloading it again but it does the same thing, absolutely nothing, almost like it doesn't recognize  a touch. I will be deleting it and not downloading it again. Such a huge disappointment and waist of time. I was so excited about this game because I love hidden object games, I guess I'll try to find another one. If this bug gets fixed I will reconsider trying it again.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|For more of my reviews, visit my blog Such A Novel Idea!<br /><br />Why You Should Buy It<br /><br />This book is quite amazing -- Colleen Hoover knows just how to reel you in, rip your heart out, and give it back to you slowly, one page at a time. I have yet to read something by Hoover I haven't immediately loved.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />OMG, another Colleen Hoover book doing something I haven't read before.<br /><br />This book completely broke my heart -- it brought in heartache, and out 0f the blue twists and turns. I found my mouth wide open so many times.<br /><br />The poetry in the book was amazing, and I wish Slam was something they had around here, because I think I would fall in love with its beauty just like Lake did. The play on words that Will uses in one of his prominent pieces had me not only in tears, but really thinking about the emphasis he put on death and life. And the use of the Avett brothers was like the cherry on top, it was a really great tribute to the band.<br /><br />The writing was great -- Hoover is a top-notch author and knows how to get inside her character's heads. I read that this book was written during NaNoWriMo -- which is something that I aspire to do one day. The fact that she wrote this amazing piece of work in 30 days (and even used the book to promote NaNoWriMo in one of the slams) was awesome!<br /><br />I honestly hope this book is picked up for a movie, it was definitely something that I could see on the big screen. Overall, I was thoroughly impressed, and knee deep in Will and Lake. I know that readers young adult and adults alike will love this story.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />Five out of Five Stars
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app game &#34;MAGIC PUZZLES&#34;, is wonderful for those who loves and enjoys playing with PUZZLES.  I love it, especially when some of the pieces happens to help you find their way to connect themselves...like MAGIC! AWESOME  Game.  BLUEY.
B005LAJ212|5.0|An excellent first season. Very good premise with a perfect cast. Addictive and really draws the viewers in. Very climatic finale.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Haven't even started this book but read the review for the third book. I should have recognized the similarities in this series as in Fifty Shades of Grey.  That this relationship between Gideon and Eva was doomed from the start. A very unhealthy existence. Too bad that I waited until all the series was published (or so I thought) because I'm glad I did knowing what I know now. I will not buy the third book but I will finish reading this one. It may leave me in limbo but I can just use my imagination or remember how Fifty Shades of Grey's third book ended happily ever after. Thanks but no thanks. Shame on you for trying to squeeze more money out of us.
0061564893|5.0|This book is so interesting that I ordered a duplicate for a friend.  Amazon used books are cheap and almost like new.

B00000JCB2|5.0|Limp Bizkit are one of those bands that are either loved or hated by the masses. I was a teenager when these guys exploded onto the scene; so I tend to have a soft spot for them somewhere down deep. Whether you like, love, or despise Fred Durst, back in the late 90s and early part of the new century he was nothing short of the man.<br /><br />Released in 1999, \\"Significant Other\\" took Limp Bizkit's formula of rap-rock and made it a household phenomenon. I remember buying this album the day it came out; I listened to it and thought wow, they upped their game quite a lot. The songs on this album clearly take on a more radio-friendly approach than their debut did, and with songs like \\"Nookie,\\" \\"Break Stuff\\" and \\"N 2 Gether Now\\" they ruled radio for a couple short years. The album is solid throughout, and the majority of the songs are actually quite good. There's a tiny bit of filler here, but it's nothing to make you shy away from this decent record.<br /><br />This album, along with their follow-up record were my two favorite Limp Bizkit records back in the day. I never cared for \\"Results May Vary\\" or \\"Three Dollar Bill Y'all,\\" but Limp's on the comeback trail, and from what I'm hearing it's pretty decent so far.

B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp Bizkit are one of those bands that are either loved or hated by the masses. I was a teenager when these guys exploded onto the scene; so I tend to have a soft spot for them somewhere down deep. Whether you like, love, or despise Fred Durst, back in the late 90s and early part of the new century he was nothing short of the man.<br /><br />Released in 2000, and just a little over a year after their smash hit \\"Significant Other,\\" \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" followed much in the footsteps of its predecessors. Now, besides the dumbest album name in history (something to do with anus and all), this album is actually Limp Bizkit's best and most concise work to my ears. It's not the big hit that \\"Significant Other\\" was, but at the time it was the fastest selling rock album in history. If you enjoy your rock heavy, rapping verses and toned down guitars, then this band is for you. I was never a big fan of the nu-metal genre or rap-rock genre, whatever they call it now, but these guys always seemed to write good, if not silly songs. Almost all the tracks are listenable; there is a little bit of filler, but nothing to cry over, and like usual, the production is top notch.<br /><br />This is a no brainer if you like Limp Bizkit at all; if you like the nu-metal genre and don't have this record already, buy it up quick. These guys, along with most of the other nu-metal acts have since turned into the same jokes as many of the late-80's hair bands, and unfortunately a comeback has proved tuff to come by.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Gotta say, I'm really impressed with the author's skill and weaving (hah! pun!) a story. I was prepared to indulge myself in my guilty pleasure of sci fi dystopian lit, and instead found a crew of wonderfully nuanced characters and well-crafted conflicts. One of the hardest parts of this kind of fiction is making the world believable. And Howey's detailed sense of the silo is fantastic.<br />I'm waiting to get the next book just so I can catch up on my sleep.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Some loved this movie and some downright hated it. Personally, I thought -- in terms of story -- \\"Cloud Atlas\\" (based on the David Mitchell novel [[ASIN:0812984412 Cloud Atlas (Movie Tie-in Edition): A Novel]]) was a masterpiece! A true cinematic work of art! From the brothers behind [[ASIN:B001DJLD1M The Matrix Collection: 4 Film Favorites]] and the director of [[ASIN:B000021Y77 Run Lola Run]], comes this movie anthology where all of the stories -- taking place at different times (1849, 1936, 1973, 2012, 2144, and 2321) -- are interconnected somehow (hence the tagline \\"Everything is connected\\"). Each story somehow inadvertantly or purposely affects the next chronological story's character(s)/story, and the order in which the stories are shown correlates with its neighboring story. Confused? Lost? Well, if you don't seriously pay attention, you will be. The overall message is that our lives somehow can affect others' lives in ways we did not think possible; this is best summed up by troubled composer Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw) when he narrates, \\"My life extends far beyond the limitations of me.\\" Another message is that we should not be afraid to stand up for what is truly right ... even if you feel outnumbered (this especially comes to mind since for the past 13 years questioning government, politicians or big business/money has been -- to put it lightly -- frowned upon); this is best summed up when Hugo Weaving's Haskell Moore tells his son-in-law, Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess), who has decided to take his wife to work for the abolitionist movement, \\"There is a natural order to this world, and those who try to upend it do not fare well. This movement will never survive. If you join them, you and your entire family will be shunned. At best, you will exist a pariah to be spat at and beaten, at worse to be lynched or crucified. And for what? For what? No matter what you do it will never amount to anything more than a single drop in a limitless ocean,\\" to which Ewing replies, \\"What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?\\" It's all about perspective. Would you rather be someone who thinks a drop in the ocean is meaningless ... or would you rather be someone who, no matter how small, has the satisfaction of knowing you contributed? The cast all do spectacular jobs and it is a nice little kick to see them all taking on such a number of eclectic characters. The movie is a little lengthy at just under 3 hours, but the time goes by fast as the stories all pull you in to their respective worlds and keep you on the edge of your seat. I could write a lot more about this film ... but not without giving away too much plot, so I'll simply say the themes in this film are powerful and resonate long after the movie ends.eplies, \\"What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?\\" It's all about perspective.

B008G3N71W|3.0|Wow....  This book was a bit over the top for me.  There's titilating and then there's icky.  This one was icky, just icky.  I read on, hoping for a redemptive quality where there was none.  BDSM I can navigate but this fetish is out there and asserting that self-actualization results from it is laughable at best.  Perhaps the author could use some discipline!

B0062HS03O|4.0|There isn't much to say about Lady Gaga that hasn't been said already, but die-hard fans and new-comers alike to New York's avant-garde pop sensation will be pleased with HBO's treatment of The Monster Ball, Gaga's second world tour. It's campy, it's flashy, it will make you want to dance and it will make you understand why Gaga has taken the world by storm. You might think you've heard Paparazzi on the radio 500 times by now, but it's certainly a fresh experience at The Monster Ball, where she sings it as she's devoured by a giant light-up angler fish while wearing a dress that's half Wizard of Oz, half origami and 100% sparkly...seriously. Even Gaga's lesser known (but still fantastic) songs are treated with all the glamour and energy of her A-listers. &#34;Teeth&#34; is extended into a 10 minute raise-the-roof sing/scream-along, and So Happy I Could Die is performed in a dress that's...well...alive. The Monster Ball is one of those &#34;see-it-for-yourself&#34; experiences that a review can't do justice to. As far as the Blu-ray transfer, both the video and audio are well up to par with what is expected. Expect to be able to count every sequin on-screen, or see every fiber in Gaga's radiant wigs. I only deducted a star because this isn't exactly the completely concert. Gaga's actual tour was enhanced by primarily black-and-white interludes made by the photo-artists at SHOWSTUDIO. And boy, were they something. The starting interlude, a dramatic black-and-white countdown set to &#34;Finally,&#34; was probably the moment everyone remembers from their trip to The Monster Ball. HBO decides to cut most of these interludes and drastically shorten the others. &#34;Dance in the Dark,&#34; the intro song, is also shortened. This is acceptable for TV broadcast where time is a concern, but don't cheat people paying for the DVD or BD out of the full experience. They had the full footage available and decided not to lengthen the concert for home video release. This, in my opinion, is unforgivably lazy. Other than the unfortunate editing, Monster Ball diehards will love revisiting Gaga's most famous tour to date.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I must say;  I am so glad that I did not go with the crowd of people who did not care for the third installment of Gideon Cross and Eva.  I loved the two previous books and could not get enough of Gideon and Eva.  So, against all of the negative reviews, I thought I would see what all the fuss is about and why such negative reviews in the third installment.  I was ready to not like it, particularly since there were people complaining about all of the sex in the beginning.  I kept looking for all of this sex and did not see it, unlike the last book in the Grey series.  I am confused and do not understand.  Entwined With You was just as fantastic and powerful as the first two.  I love how Sylvia Day writes.  She can pull a love scene together like no other.  I say \\"love scene\\" because that is what they were.  Steamy yes, erotic yes, but done with such taste and style and passion.  Everyone keeps comparing Cross with Grey, when I see no comparison. Cross left Grey at the \\"start line\\" and Grey never caught up.  In book three of the Grey series, I cannot count how many times I skimmed page after page after page, particularly the \\"sex\\" scenes.  To me, Sylvia Day had Gideon Cross in my mind, my mind's eyes, and heart. He is so mature and sophisticated wherein Grey is young and immature.  Gideon and Eva are such likeable characters and Sylvia Day makes you feel like they are part of your family.  We laugh with them, we cry with them and oh my, do you feel like you are in Eva's place in the sex/love scenes.  Once again, Sylvia Day did not take page after page with sex scenes as a page filler.  Day would create this magickal, sensual place of sex wherever it might be taken place and if Gideon and Eva go at it again, lol, she ends it and leaves that to your imagination.<br /><br />I also cannot see why so many people are upset that there are more than three books. I am glad that there will be more of Gideon and Eva, as I cannot get enough of Gideon Cross and want more, more, more.  He is like a good book to which one does not ever wish to end.  Plus, I feel I have to re-read Gideon and Eva's story again and again.  I will never read Shades series again, since I had a hard time getting through the Grey series.  Also, there are plenty of books out there in similarity.<br /><br />Needless to say, I loved this third installment of Gideon Cross and Eva, as they both struggle with their past, working with each other in the present, so that there could be a future.  Lovely written, undying love with a hero any woman would love to embrace and a heroine that all women wish were in her shoes.  I am so glad that I did not allow some people's dislike for this book to influence me. Do yourself a favor, and read this book.  Make your own decision.  Everyone is different and you might find yourself enjoying and loving this book as much as I did.  I cannot wait for the next installment.  If Ms. Day can keep on building on this relationship between Gideon and Eva and creates such fantastic reads, I say go for it.

B004X4R49Y|2.0|the film realistically showed how the new king conquered his stammering enough to be able to address the English people over the airwaves in a manner that was at least acceptable.<br />however, his journey getting there, was really not too engaging, and at the end of the film I was thrilled it was over, was bored with the characters who never really engaged my mind. I really did not care about the story or the relationships as it was portrayed.<br />I realize that I am not in sync with many reviews of this film. but this is my perception.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day has done it again. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and finished it in one day, partly because I have no life and also because it was a good read. It leaves off right where the second one ended. You see a different side to Gideon which is what I was wanting to see in this book. *****SPOILER*****: I did think it was kind of weird that she wanted to play with his butt but hey, it added to the story and for him to trust her completely despite his past. ***END OF SPOILER**** Okay, so I don't know why everyone is complaining about more books...I LOVE reading more about their story and hope that it never ends since it is so hot.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|The more I liked it and realized how many songs that these guys have had on the radio.  There are some definite Queen parallels that can be drawn to these songs (soaring, operatic harmonies, break neck guitar solos a la Brian May), but overall it's a fun romp.
0060853972|5.0|This book is one of the funniest and most entertaining I have ever read. I've been a fan of Neil Gaiman and was familiar with Terry Pratchett's work, but had not read anything by him before this. The two of them worked together smashingly to put together this masterpiece. It's even more entertaining because it has interviews with each about the other at the end which were done when this book was written, which was before either of them were nearly as famous as they are today.

B00C33M2EE|5.0|I am soooo glad The Piano Guys released the DVD of their awesome music videos along with their CD--As great as they are to listen to (and they are wonderful, talented musicians!) it really adds something to watch them.  They obviously love what they do and it is exceptionally fun to watch them at work.  I kept my 3 year old grand-daughter mesmerized for about 1/2 hour when I pulled them up on YouTube, and the DVD is much more convenient.  Frankly, it can keep me mesmerized as well.  Now I wonder what it will take to get The Piano Guys to release the music videos for their previous albums....<br /><br />The Piano Guys never fail to delight and please.  I highly recommend this CD/DVD set.

B004I744AS|5.0|There were two specific items that I was aiming for in selecting a dictionary app: concise &amp; ease.  I've tried several app on other devices, and they ranged from &quot;good&quot; to &quot;too much other stuff&quot; to &quot;incomplete definitions.&quot;  Yes there are apps out there that provide incomplete definitions!<br /><br />I began reading the comments by the users and really comparing the various apps.  I am very happy that I did choose this particular app.  It's clear and provides enough information quickly.  I would recommend this app.

B00CATSONE|4.0|Clear insight into study of genious in the forward that expands into the amazing achievements of Tesla himself.

Leaves you asking \\"what if?\\".
B00493E1GI|4.0|My sister wanted to see this movie on a summer visit. We broke the viewing of this long movie into half. It was a great view of parts of the world I will never see. Taking a peek into other cultures was great. I was getting irritated at the indecisiveness of the lead character.<br />It gave us a springboard into pleasant conversation.

B007SXB498|5.0|Jane Austen at her best!  The characters came to life as I read of the stoic Elinor hiding her heartbreak from her family and friends to protect them as the dramatic and immature Marianne publicly humiliates herself in her pursuit of the scoundrel who has jilted her.  From the beginning when the unfeeling and snobbish Mrs. John Dashwood and her spineless husband set the action in motion by displacing Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters after the death of the patriarch, the scene is set to show how women in Austen's era were at the mercy of their male protectors. The dependance of the Miss Dashwoods continue as the nosy friends add insult to injury without being aware that their comments are more hurtful than well placed blades, their immature mother has no sense of the limitations her lowered station in life , the ever valiant Colonel Brandon keeps watch over Marianne despite her rejection for the far less worth Willoughby, and the dutiful Edward Ferrars whose previous attachment prevents him from declaring his true and obvious love for Elinor weaves a tail of love, abandonment, and human nature.

0316154687|5.0|My first David Sedaris read. Once I read this book I was hooked, and the books which have followed have not let me down yet. This book reminds me of a place in time where family came first and life was lived. He puts forth his story in such a way that it makes you not want to put the book down and once you've finished, you actually miss the characters. Great book!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Sadly I waited to become a fan of Fringe now that it is over, however with that said, I've been able to enjoy the entire series back to back moving from episode to episode, season to season without any wait to see what happens next!  This show has been amazing!  I'm a huge fan of X-files, Roswell, Buffy, Lost anything that is different from the norm.  This show really made me think, while it hasn't had aliens or vampires, the use of science to bring out abilities and has an alternate dimension... tell me that isn't a cool idea!  Plus it has J.J. Abrams involved.  Does that guy touch anything that doesn't turn to gold?  To me, no, I am a huge fan and as long as he keeps writing amazing different stories that keep the mind guessing, I will support what he does!  I hope you all enjoy a great cast and laugh at Walter Bishop, his genius and child like atmosphere keep the show light when it begins to turn darker...
B006PIXKVW|5.0|A good movie for the whole family to watch.  Takes you back to the times when movies were clean and no junk included.  Makes you feel good.
B003U4ZQUM|5.0|I love love love this show! And now that I can watch the entire series without commercials, I've become a TV zombie. At least for a weekend...but it's really hard to stop watching.
B005F2BBLK|5.0|While the plot may be &#34;highly predictable&#34;, (watch it and you'll find that funny) the story moves at a perfect pace with enough laughs to keep adults entertained as much as the kids. The best part however, is the incredible animation. The water looks so unbelievably real and the facial motions and expressions of the characters must be seen. The voice actors are all very talented, unlike some other feature films for kids where the actors seem to be reading from a book, badly.( &#34;The Reef&#34; comes to mind.) Watch it once and you'll keep it on your watch list for good!
0670014893|1.0|When I read the last paragraph of Mr. Le Carre's  \\"A Delicate Truth,\\" my immediate reaction was a very loud \\"what the heck\\" (only stronger)(I actually said it very loudly sitting alone on my back deck).  The book has no ending.  I don't know why I was surprised.  After reading \\"The Tailor of Panama,\\" I promised myself that I would never read another book of his.  But there was nothing to read, so I bought this book and read it.  There is no denying that Mr. Le Carre is a wonderful writer.  I love his style and  he keeps my interest.  But the ending, well there is no ending.  It just stops.<br /><br />Clearly Mr. Le Carre, ever since the Bush years at least, hates his American cousins.  I mean, he makes no bones about it.  But in \\"A Delicate Truth\\", he paints a picture of an unforgiving England as a place that I would never want to live.  Perhaps he thinks England has become too Americanized.  Well I'm an American; I'm a second generation son of uneducated but intelligent children of immigrants, who worked his way up on his own to become an attorney.  Let's see someone do that in his beloved England -and I resent his attitude toward America!  I don't know why we support him by buying his books.  This will be the last one I buy.<br /><br />I thought Mr. Le Carre ran away to some island to live, but my not-very-careful research says that he lives in England.  He is one of those people who criticizes and hides.  He does nothing to improve the conditions he abhors, certainly not in his writing.  We should have guessed that he would be like that when we first knew he was not using his real name.  He is not very courageous.  He criticizes from the shadows.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that this is the same person who wrote \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" and the rest of those terrific cold war books that I love.  This book, while well written, is extremely unsatisfying and really has no ending.  I'll make up my own ending and it will be a very happy one!  Take that Mr. Le Carre.Le Carre.
B000QK7YQ2|5.0|This film is like a trip back in time to the roots of current motorcycle use and racing. If you're over 40, you'll remember (sometimes painfully) what motorcycles were like &#34;back in the day&#34;. If you're younger, you should watch just for the cool history lesson. Watches like a Warren Miller ski flick. Check it out!
B00CRW2066|5.0|From &#34;Trophy Wife&#34; to &#34;Karen&#34; to &#34;Sorrow&#34; and now &#34;Sea of Love&#34;, The National continuously pump out songs that start as minimal, slow, and maybe even underwhelming, but upon repeated listens, emerge as warm, full, emotive, and transcendent pieces of beauty. This album can't be called their best work only because none of their albums have ever missed a step.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Highly enjoyable, especially to anyone suffering a loss of loved family or friends.  I congratulate Dr. Alelxander for sharing the big secret of everasting joy and happiness.  Doctors are notorious for allowing only the &#34;scientific&#34; analysis as proof.  I hope now all those &#34;Doubting Thomases&#34;  can and will  accept proof from a superior educated neurosurgeons &#34;scientific&#34; as well as humanistic experience, this joy awaits all with goodness in their heart.  A beautifully told experience.

1936608898|5.0|I don't really know where to start. I began eating a Paleo diet a few weeks before I read this book and was still struggling with low energy, slow weight loss, aches & pains that I've had my entire life, sleep disturbances and moodiness. The information is incredibly simple and seems so obvious once you read it. If your food isn't making you healthier, it's making you sick. I started the autoimmune version of Paleo and had immediate results. My entire life of illnesses has been caused by food. It's been a little over 2 months - I have increased energy, I have lost 30 pounds, my aches & pains are rare and only occur when I eat something I'm sensitive to, and I sleep through the night. I have been taking daily medication for Hashimoto's disease (thyroid) for over a year and am now being weaned off of it. My hormone levels are stable and I have not experienced any moodiness or anxiety. If you have an autoimmune disease such as chronic fatigue, thyroid problems, inflammation problems, or fibromayalgia..you should definitely give this a try.

B00BTHWFBK|1.0|Let's make believe this album didn't happen.. Sabbath lost its way... Remember when the band was fueled by political angst? When it was called Earth and changed its name to something ominous? When Geezer's lyrics reminded us the hippies weren't going to save the planet, that we needed to get real? What happened? Ozzy burned out, got lazy, had kids, a fame seeking wife, a Hollywood house, MTV cotton candy... Iommi hung on to the band, turned the dial to bland... Ward bowed out... Geezer kept the flame going, went vegan, still wrote strong lyrics for his own projects... But in the end, the \\"mission\\" that was Black Sabbath, that sparked the imagination of an entire generation, over the years the corners were sanded down, the fangs yanked out, the claws removed... the mission to save the planet died, sold out to the mainstream, hearts broken.

1476733953|5.0|I've heard all of the arguments in its favor, but the fact remains that almost everything that is self-published is absolutely awful and should be buried forever. The problem is that this tsumani of self-published trash has swamped the book market and all but wrecked it.<br /><br />That said, I have finally discovered a self-published novel that is not only good, but excellent. That novel is WOOL by Hugh Howey.<br /><br />Of course another of the arguments of the self-published crowd has been squashed flat by the fact that this phenomenal book was noticed by the good folk at Simon & Schuster and picked up as a mass market paperback. Which is how I purchased it, since I long ago swore never to buy another self-published novel.<br /><br />And now to the book. I won't bore everyone with the details of Mr. Howey's background and his writing of the book. That's probably old news to you, and if it's not, then go out a buy a copy.<br /><br />Here's the thing about the novel:<br /><br />It's wonderful.<br /><br />Every now and again I will stumble upon a book that is so well written and so perfectly realized that I find it difficult to understand how a writer can achieve the collective effects. This is such a book. The story is told in truly polished prose that seized me and impressed me and forced me to keep reading. I was locked in as soon as I began reading. The hook is that effective.<br /><br />In addition, Howey does not just slap the story down in a clever fashion and keep you reading on the adrenaline of a snappy opening. No, this is a thinking man's book. As you read you keep turning the pages to find out what's behind the next barrier that the author is helping you to chip away. WOOL is a very complicated book with lavish detail that is interwoven with fully realized characters who all act in a very human way in a very logical setting.<br /><br />This novel floored me.<br /><br />The hero of the book is a resourceful young woman named Juliette. She comes from the depths of the underground city in which everyone lives, that protects them from an Earth that has become a hellish and uninhabitable wasteland. There are powerful forces arrayed against her, and the reading of her struggle against this evil intent is unlike anything I've read in years.<br /><br />And all along something kept tickling at the back of my mind. Hugh Howey's work reminded me of another writer, but I couldn't pin down who that writer was. It wasn't any of the logical authors who came to mind as I struck them off the list, one at a time.<br /><br />And then it hit me:<br /><br />Hal Clement! Howey has constructed a novel as perfectly logical and as well woven as something by the great Hal Clement. Comparisons to Clement's NITROGEN FIX might be well-founded, as there are very similar themes in both novels. But Howey goes a step beyond NITROGEN FIX and has produced a novel of extreme depth and clarity. There are themes at work here that were well considered and deftly executed.<br /><br />The short of it is that my hat's off to Hugh Howey. WOOL is a spectacular novel and I can't but give it my highest recommendations.depths of the underground city in which everyone lives, that protects them from an Earth that has become a hellish and uninhabitable wasteland.

B00CL68QVQ|1.0|The title of this says it all.  This movie felt so contrived.  Honestly, the downfall of this film was Jennifer Lawrence.  Her performance was subpar at best.  The leads had zero chemistry.  All of Lawrence's \\"craziness\\" or \\"quirks\\" felt competely forced and predictable.  Lawrence was too young for this role and the lack of depth is extremely obvious.  How she won anything for this performance is absolutely beyond me.  Must just be a tactic to sell future movie tickets.

B005AUWXZ0|1.0|Happy to be proven wrong on this, but to this point I can only access English and English closed-captioning on the digital copy of this.  Very disappointed.  I am fed up of not being able to have our DVDs on the iPad, and so thought this might allow us to do so.  Yes, we can watch it on the Ipad.  NO, we don't have all the language options.  Should have just bought it in Itunes for a lot less money.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|Didn't care for this move, I've never been a Rogen fan, should have steered clear & he is my least favorite actor!!
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|If you love the Eagles, you will love this item. As one of my all-time favorite groups, the Eagles have an interesting history as individuals and as a band.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|A great family movie.  I watched it with my 12 & 14 yr olds and we all loved it!  I'd watch it again.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|non stop action film filled with stars from the 80's, 90's and even a few new ones. this movie shows how action packed a movie can be by giving us the best of every world with non stop shoot outs combined with the best action acors ever. This really is a grab the pop corn, plug in the sound bar and wait for the thrill ride movie.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Its a well-written well acted show. It's almost like watching a mini movie. I think its a story that has it been told in this way. I don't normally like the sci-fi shows, but this one I really like.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I am so disappointed in this app as I have a Kindle Fire HD and would like to have access to my books on the android phone as well.  However, on downloading the app (many attempts at this point) I receive a &#34;parsing error&#34; message and the app is not functional - it simply stays with the description of the app with no way to access reading material.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|What can you say about Dexter at this point.  Best antihero out there by far.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|I usually don't like to watch movies more than one time, but I will definitely be watching this one again.  It was so good we shared it with relatives so they could enjoy it too.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Not as good as the original. The monkeys are a silly substitute for the pigs and the airport venues are not fun. Fially the awards are even more stupid. I'd give the game a D!
B0024FAG5I|3.0|***1/2 STARS<br /><br />Sam Raimi's attempt to pay homage to Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns was a worthwhile, if not ill-concieved, effort. The story revolves around the old west town of Redemption, at the tail-end of the Wild West era, where an annual quick-draw competition sets the stage for our story. A beautiful, but mysterious, stranger (Sharon Stone) comes to town to join the contest with designs on taking out the orchestrator of the event, Herod (played skillfully, as always, by Gene Hackman), an evil tyrant and presumably the fastest gun in the west, who rules the town with an iron fist. What follows is a corlorful and assorted cast of characters bolstered by strong performances from Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio, Lance Henriksen, and Keith David.<br /><br />What Raimi succeeds at is creating a fun western that isn't dreadfully serious. Unfortunately, Raimi fails in his attempt to fill the movie with substance. The stranger's backstory of (as a small girl) being forced to shoot and kill her own father by Herod and his men in an attempt to save his life is as emotional and gripping as a dry ham sandwich. There are also attempts to make this a story of redemption with the Preacher Cort (Crowe) trying to make ammends for the sins of his past and The Kid (DiCaprio) just trying to elicit some sort of acceptance and love from his father. Neither really hit the mark, and in The Kid's case it falls flat.<br /><br />That aside, however, the movie is fun, and thats all that really matters right?
B000T06172|5.0|It is what everyone says it is, a masterpiece!  Brian Wilson is a genius and Carl Wilson has a beautiful voice, the two together on this album have created a unusual, wonderful work of art.<br /><br />. The Beach Boys are not the Beach Boys without those two.
B003FL4O9E|5.0|Ok so the special effects are out dated and the jokes are cheesy, fact is, this movie has all the elements of TMNT. This film is a must see with the family. By far the best TMNT film there is.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I rented this movie. It's so good that you forget that it is subtitled.
B008CRC506|5.0|This by far is my favorite TV show and I was so upset when they cancelled it!! What a shame!! Looking forward to buying Season 2 when it comes out!!
1781162646|5.0|A loveable dog that doesn't die by Stephen King's hands! I'm sure he must have had a trauma involving a dog in his childhood since all the dogs in his stories meet horrific ends....and especially since I live with four Jack Russell terriers I was relieved (Spoiler Alert!) that this one makes it to the end of the book unscathed.<br /><br />Anyway, this was an incredible read. This story has something for all reading tastes--it's a well-tuned ghost story, a rousing cold case mystery, and tender coming-of-age story, with a bit of carnival \\"documentary\\" thrown it. It will be best read at the beach, preferable in North Carolina.<br /><br />So get this book and tear through it. And Fellow Dog Lovers, rest assured-- there are no animals harmed in the making if this book!
B002KGEORM|4.0|Likes:<br /><br />Great series, has me hooked<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />Acting gets bad at times,  gets too fictional, too<br /><br />Overall<br />A must watch
B0095P33IW|4.0|Not a Chris Evans fan but he was just right. Love Hugo Weaving.; his Red Skull gives Tom Hiddleston's Loki a run for the money. Good cast, well written; although his &#34;love&#34; interest's part was a bit over-written. Liked the parallel between him running through New York in the 40s and &#34;today&#34; once he awoke from hibernation, as well as tesseract tie to the Avengers. The gods really should be more careful with their &#34;stuff.&#34;
B000P0J09W|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood. I never get tired of it. The DVD arrived on time but it does have some defects. It skips in a couple of places.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Slaughterhouse Five was the beginning of Vonnegut's black humor, train-of-thought writing.<br /><br />His ability to jump from one time and event to another is uncanny, and his perception of life and people unique. Here are our favorite science-fiction writer, Kilgore Trout, and the wealthy and lonely Eliot Rosewater. And more. Vonnegut's characters reappear in his works and give us new insight into our own turbulent and confusing lives.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|best I've seen in years. Based on a true story, it has everything, drama, comedy, suspense, music, wit, and love.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|I selected this book for my book club based on an internet search for highly recommended reads.  Comparing the reviews with the reality, I am disappointed that I selected it for my group.<br /><br />The greatest issue I had with the book is that there was little character or plot development. I appreciated the author's mystical adventure so the lack of development fueled my disappointment.  Yes, it tells a basic story but it was rushed from here, then to here, and then this happened and that happened.....  It was almost like someone narrating a story board.
B001HBWY8M|3.0|This is a cute show for tweens, even PG.  However, I held off for a long time watching it because the cover makes it look at lot more risque and not something I'd let my tween daughters watch.  Very predictable, but cute if you like that kind of happy ending.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Finally a kindle fire game I enjoyed!<br />Extremely detailed and beautiful fully designed. The puzzles were very clever and challenging. The clues helped the game not become a frustrating nightmare.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is very helpful for me, I like it very much. .<br />I recommend this product , it worth its price
B009NY43NY|5.0|Once again Charlaine Harris has created an exciting, page turner of a book.  This is the best candy ever...and no caleries attached.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is worth the cost for the paid version. Not only no ads but much smaller size as well.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have yet to find a Sookie Stackhouse Novel that I have not loved!!!  Ready to read the next one.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I  ENJOYED  THE  FIRST  BOOK  OF  THE<br />  CLIFTON  CHRONICLES  AND  HAVE<br />  ENJOYED  THE  FIRST  3<br />  LOOKING  FORWARD  TO  NEW  CLIFTON CHRONICLES  BOOKS
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun,awesome and entertaining .I will rate it a 5 star game!!<br />Everyone loves it including me . I think subway surfers will be another famous game.
B00CUWKHVI|5.0|I have many of Jamie's older albums and I like those, too.  As a professional musician, it's always fascinating to me to hear an artist's evolution over time.  With this album, he embraces a more mainstream sound but his style remains intact.  Very well done.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I watched this on my kindle and was surprised at how well I could see it...the movie was great...I have recommended it to several friends and family members. Thanks and have a blessed day.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Saw the movie and wanted to own it.  The costumes, the setting and the acting were great.  Got the dvd for good price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game super fun. You get to run away from a police man and get coins at the same time. When you start out your not so good but you better. I kept hitting my head something. But now I'm really good and I love it
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|This app is great. I can make so many good photos look even better! I think this app deserves a five star rating.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Its a cool game, I like it. I don't like waiting though, but its a nice game to play every once winna while.
B0012HCASA|5.0|Really enjoyed this show, greatly for the excellent character played by Summer Glau. She really deserved more screen time. Hope to see her continue this role on the big screen.
6305428387|5.0|For anyone that says that fact is stranger than fiction, there are movies like `Cool Runnings' proving them correct in that statement.  The beauty of `Cool Runnings' is the fun, the sheer engaging entertainment value of the story and the approach taken, and the cast doesn't hurt.  With John Candy in one of his final roles, and a slew of talented young men taking on that unlikely bobsled team, this is a surefire hit for any household.<br /><br />A word of caution, there is some harsh language in scenes, and this is not a film directed at kids but more a film directed at families with older children.  There are some rough scenes (particularly a bar fight) but most of the film is shot for laughs, and it achieves those.<br /><br />The film is also built to evoke those feelings of triumph in the face of all odds, and it does that rather well (even if it verges on schmaltzy).  This true story of a Jamaican runner dreaming of the Olympics is one of those `you have to see it to believe it' type stories.  When an accident prevents him from competing, Derice is determined to compete in some way shape or form, and so he convinced Irv, a washed up former Olympian with a shoddy past, to coach him and some fellow Jamaicans to become the first ever Jamaican bobsled team.  The world laughed in their faces and yet they prevailed and won the respect of all.<br /><br />The dialog is sharp, the character development is actually quite rich (everyone has a backstory and everyone feels complete) and the end result is a film you can really stand up and cheer for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great fun game most worth the download especially the you don't have to lean part so download this game outs fun
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Best movie ever! Can watch over and over again. A feel good movie. Makes you laugh and cry.Love Sandra Bullock.
0670014893|3.0|Tedious plot with little imagination. I did like the fact that the tennis balls they used were refrigerated. Learn something every day.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was not as long as I expected, but it didn't disappoint. Connor was the ultimate mistake and the Prince Charming every woman fantasizes about, reluctant emotions aside. And Megan was a heroine anyone would want to emulate. Better than a beach read, while perfectly beach worthy for its length and sultry seductive power. I will recommend this one!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book on Tesla. What genius and selfless sage to mankind. Too bad for all the greed, lust & power in the world then & now. All my best to the author for their research and presentation. Excellent job.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I have just fininshed watching this video for the fourth time in three months.  You guessed it; Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors and Pride and Prejudice is my favorite of her novels.  Viewing this dramatization on the two disks takes about five and one half hours which is too short a time.  I was very upset when it ended, and I recommend watching the whole thing in one sitting if possible.<br /><br />Reading the noverl is preferable to watching any of the movie versions, however if you cannot read for any number of reasons this is the best adaptation available.  It is broken into five segments and split over two disks, but it is still worth the time to see it.<br /><br />Have you been turned off by many of the so-called period pieces?  My sympathies to you.  Do not, for your own sake, be turned off by this in considering this adaptation.  I find it as close as possible to the written word and well acted and photographed. A friend says she will watch anything with Colin Firth.  Whatever your reason for watching this watch it and enjoy it and keep it close to rewatch.
B002EXGAS2|4.0|It was a great movie.... lots of fun and fast loud cars.  Clean too so it the whole family watched it.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Predictable, predictable, predictable couldn't wait for it to be over. For those who are over 40 don't waste your time.
B00AW0KHMY|4.0|I'm a fan of the Books and I found most of the movies in this series to be lacking in every category but one..  They did add minor approved content the books didn't have but not enough to off set that fact that the movies feel like that were made for a fast buck!, to Me.
B00C1S945G|5.0|not a fan of any of this HD stuff but it's still star trek.  no question, five stars for captain worf.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This app is very basic and simple - but even with that - it still keeps you wanting to play it more.  I am not one who plays lots of games on my phone - so it is nice to have a bright colorful simple game to occupy the small amount of spare time I have.
B005HEPN06|5.0|Grew up with Star Trek. Always liked the Captain of the Enterprise and his great examples of leadership whether it was Kirk or Picard!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Great DVD production.  Absolutely awesome visuals of battles, romance, and intrigue.  The air wars were breathtaking.  Shows some fantastic backstage scenes, and out-takes.  Really amazing. Got to get this one!
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|Hans Zimmer has evolved throughout his career by embracing new styles and technologies.  His work has become more electronic, more bombastic, and more powerful over the years.  This is not a score for those who appriciate subtlety and nuance.  This is an action score through and through and it truly delivers.  Zimmer rarely misses a beat (literally) as he throws percussion and electronics into every track.  Many of the other reviews have gone through substanital legwork to outline each track, but I wish to convey my emotional response.  I listened to this score before the movie ever arrived in theaters and it stands strongly on its own.  The Main Superman Theme does not attempt to replicate the brilliant meoldic compisition of the Williams score many years ago, but rather servs to viscerally illicit an emotional response.  This is not your father's Superman.  Darkness rises (pun intended) and the stakes could not be greater.  The General Zod theme also conveys the epic menace of an existential threat to humanity.  While the melodies are simple, even for a Zimmer score, he squeezes every ounce of emotion from them.  Valid criticism of Zimmer prevents this score from obtaining 5 stars.  Clearly, Zimmer has entered a comfort zone and has recycled techniques from his Dark Knight, Da Vinci Code, and Inception scores which may frustrate some listeners.  Relentlessly, each track is filled with many layers, but the percussion and electronics often overpower the more subtle aspects of the soundtrack.  Ultimately, for me, it comes to personal preference.  Certainly I miss his scores for Gladiator and the Last Samurai, but I embrace this dark, action heavy score.  I will certainly listen to this entire soundtrack many times more than I will watch the movie.<br /><br />As for specifics, my favorite tracks are: \\"Look to the Stars,\\" \\"Terraforming,\\" \\"Hans Original Sketchbook,\\" (This is 28 minutes long and simply plays with different variations of the soundtrack), \\"General Zod,\\" and \\"Arcade.\\"  The packaging is by far the best CD case I've ever bought through retail.  It is reinforced plastic with a metalic feel.  Also, and this is important, the CD comes with an insert to download the entire album through an app called Z+ which is ULTRA HIGH QUALITY.  It is much better than traditional MP3 quality and truly enhances the sound in my Bose headphones.  Even when turned up all the way, there is no distortion.  I highly reccomend this soundtack even though this is not Zimmer's best.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|This is a great album it has 4 -5 hits that are currently played on the radio. it shows a wide range of songs & Adele performs well on every one of them. no losers on this album
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Good reading and helps you understand your love language as well as the language of others. And this is coming from a husband!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Tom Selleck/Jess Stone - love 'em.  What more is there to say?  Just a couple more videos and I'll have the whole set.  I'm a happy camper.
B00821OX98|5.0|Loved the characters which are real, flawed, able to grow and change.  Some unique twists on the Aliens invade earth idea, especially the use of the children. Keeps changing and growing.  Always something new and fresh around the corner.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I'm definitely not a huge Star Trek fan, but I'm familiar with some of the older shows. I had to watch this one since I saw part 2 at the theaters recently and there was a scene in that one that made me wish I had watched part one. Both Star Treks are great and entertaining to watch. My favorite genres are normally action and comedy, but this one is one I'll remember.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I couldn't read it fast enough. Now that I am done I have to wait patiently for the next book.
B003L77TZI|5.0|This was a no-brainer for me.  My granddaughter really wanted it and Amazon had a great price.  Some of the lyrics are a little over the top so I checked first with my daughter to make sure she was okay with her daughter receiving this.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV.  Great cast & writing. The special effects are the best there is. This is not a series for children. This is NOT a family show. It is for adults period. I have heard lame parents complain that the series is not family friendly... DUH!!!! It is Hannibal! It is not a show about rainbows and unicorns.<br />This is strictly adult TV.<br />Intelligent, well developed stories and characters. It is a series that knows what it is and exceeds audience members expectations. If you like shiny crappy vampire TV this also may not be for you, because the characters aren't bed hopping blood suckers. Hannibal's characters are actually interesting and they actually have depth.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the book after I saw the movie. The book definitely made me think they could have done better with the movie...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was beautiful. I feel different after reading this. This book has changed me in so many ways. It couldn't have been better.
B002O2THRO|5.0|I saw this when it originally came out and wanted to see it again before I see the newest one.  The sets and costumes were just fabulous.  Of course, I already knew how the story line went, but had forgotten some of the details.  It speaks of an opulent bygone era and a human tragedy.  Still, a very engaging movie.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I CAN'T RATE THIS BECAUSE I DIDN'T ORDER OR INSTALL THIS ITEM.I WOULD LIKE TO TRY IT IF IT DOESN'T COST TOO MUCH.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very enjoyable. Nice graphics. Challenging enough to be fun to solve. Want more!  Good diversion for whenever you're in the mood for a little puzzle solving.
B002N44XSG|4.0|Amazing and I just could not put this this down. It only took about 1hour to read. It also was not a long book but that is the only problem I see.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a very strange book...one I really didn't think I would like, but found myself eager<br />to get to the next chapter.  These two people were so interdependent on each other that<br />they loved and hated at the same time.  Amazing work.  Really done in an unusual format<br />but one that really worked.  If you can forget some of the sexual implications you will find<br />this book one that you may or may not recommend to others.  I found it hard to<br />put down.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|The Good Wife portrays a very well rounded lead character. She is out in the work force for the first time in years (ok, it's not everybody who returns to work after being a stay-at-home Mom as a junior attorney at a high-powered law firm), is dealing with the pressures of being a single Mom and trying to work out her husband's betrayal.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has done it again.  This is a beautifully written book.  The characters  are richly drawn and the stories ring true.  As with his previous books, there will be laughter and heartbreak.  Truly a great read.
B000W0B0G6|5.0|My mom used to listen to this on vinyl when I was young (I was -1 when it came out).  Ever since I was in high school (late 80s) this album has been incredibly special to me.  To this day I'm able to listen to it over and over again, front to back (I guess CDs don't have fronts or backs do they?) as if it's the first time.  It never, ever gets old.
B007704HO6|4.0|A heart warming story about the feelings between a cat  and a human being. If you like cats you won't want to put down<br />A very easy read.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Not sure I needed this, found the percentage for header for the Kindle and it really works the same. It is okay.
B005PK57IK|4.0|The main actors are all people that seem to have ethics and a likable quality.  Great storylines that keep you coming back
B008B1BL4E|5.0|I read this along with July, 1914, Countdown to War and re-read Margaret MacMillan's Paris 1919 (kind of jumped into the topic). This book is factual and a bit difficult to read because there were so many things happening and the author was trying to get them all in without coloring or emphasizing any, too much. This book illuminated something I never could understand--Serbia and the Balkans in 1990. It's impossible to read this book and not re-think the entire twentieth century.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Full of important little-known facts everyone needs to know. Told as usual in an easy to follow manner. In addition, the humor and the irony is most enjoyable.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I found this movie dragged on too long, failed tok keep me interested, with a less than exhilirating build up.  Even though Daniel Day Lewis does a good job in the role, the settings are dark and tension bland.  I would not watch this again.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I found the book very interesting. I did not know Tesla invented so many things. His persistence and dedication along with a vivid imagination has brought light and sound to the world.
B007DA2FHG|3.0|I was underwhelmed with the cinematography.  The story is revealing though, in that it is a tale of survival by a horse that endures the brutal confrontation of enemies.  In the process, we learn about how innocent victims of war have only one loyalty, which is their own survival and that of others caught in between, not to one particular side. In terms of how I measure good films, I would not watch this again.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Love Star Trek and this season was just as good as any other. Take the time to watch it fan or not.
B000002GVZ|4.0|It is a very nostalgic collection and nice on a road trip. If your not crazy about one of her songs just flip through. Most songs are good.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Love Star Trek and this season was just as good as any other. Take the time to watch it fan or not.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This season is definately different, but still very good. My wife and I have to restrain ourselves and watch only one episode per evening. That's not easy, his story is unfolding and we have to be restrained! Beginning to feel like Dexter is feeling right now.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is absolutely wonderful! I have trouble sleeping at night because when its too quiet my ears get a ringing in them and the \\"total silence\\" drives me crazy! This app has the perfect sounds that I can combine to get a relaxing peaceful sleep. I have found myself sleeping so much better and relaxed. I definetly recommend this app to anyone not being able to sleep.
030789701X|5.0|This was a great purchase, I thought the postage was excessive but when the book arrived it is huge and must weight a couple of Kg's.  The book was posted on time and arrived 11 days later (to Oz), so fast :).  This guide is the best, it has everything you need to play Skyrim and all the add on's.  I am very, very happy with this purchase  which arrived in pristine condition, no scratches or corners bent Thank you :)
B00AHXDECG|3.0|I liked his first CD much better than this one - but I am glad I have it because there are some nice songs on it - I support the artists I love!
B007V5CF5K|1.0|Both versions of Snark are in my cloud on my laptop, but don't show up on my kindle cloud, and considering I paid for them I am not happy, nor am I willing to buy anymore games.  I mean why would I waste my money buying anything else for the kindle if it doesn't give it to me after I've paid for it.  I have rebooted my kindle three times already, sinced it at least half a dozen times, and neither of the games are showing up.  This really sucks and i want my money back or both of the games to show up right now!
B00456H5LC|5.0|I really really really love this album.  I love Bruno Mars but the price was so much lower than expected and it is so good it is worth twice that.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|lets put this simply I love it if u like this you have to get all three great job zeptolab trust me 99cents is worth it
0061438294|5.0|This was a really comprehensive and easy to understand book.  As compared with Ekman, this book seems to be less scientific sounding/reading and more geared towards quick absorption.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read a lot of books. I can pretty accurately predict the ending for most. This book was an enjoyable friendly romp that kept me reading instead of guessing. :-) Hope the movie lives up to the book!
030758836X|5.0|I read this novel and instantly purchased another Flynn book.  The characters and twist in this book were great.  I don't tend to read &#34;crime novels&#34; but I had to see what all the hype was about.  I really enjoyed it and can't wait to start sharp objects.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Like in the description my app doesn't want to up update my app I can't. play with friends I'd give it 5 stars if it would update.
B003F46RVO|5.0|Amazing cast, great storyline,classic lines from Gramps & the Frog brothers, whats not to love? I've probably seen this movie over two dozen times over the years.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I enjoyed the original, with Jeff Bridges as the main character (Greetings Humans !).  So this, although even more relying on special effects than the original, was very enjoyable.  I really like seeing Bridges in this, sort of like seeing Start Trek characters in the more recent Star Trek movies.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I work with multiple servers simultanously NONE of which which is going to have additional software placed on it in order use this product.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I researched another pocket sharpener that was closely and competitively in a very close race for my buying dollar . I went with this one and was/am  quite glad that I did choose this sharpener.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Overall good app... It does not incorporate all the songs that were brought online, especially the audio CDs that were bought
B004TI1WME|4.0|It is probably the best calculator I have. Having said which it is an app on my phone that is only used about once a week.
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|pretty good to listen to end to end. Have weaned off some of the songs and have a few favorites that I repeat (I sat by the Ocean, If I had a tail, Fairweather friends, smooth sailing).<br /><br />I really like all their previous albums and I like what they've done on this album though some may consider it a departure. Some tracks sound a lot like they should be on Them Crooked Vultures (which is also a great band) though this album has QOTSA all over it.<br /><br />Happy with it for now.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Waited so long for another book from Khaled Hosseini and it was definitely worth the wait, loved it! Hopefully the next one won't take as long!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Very fun and easy. Fills time with something you can laugh at. Broke my neck about twenty time till I beat level one!!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I gave it four stars because it was a light weight movie.  It was interesting and I'm glad I watched it.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I'm so glad I purchased season 6 of Lost.  AMAZING!!!  I did an entire rewatch of the series and it just keeps get better!  Lost is fabulous storytelling.
B004P8A7J2|3.0|It cut in and out, from one person to another. You start to figure out what is going on in one scene and it goes to another.  All along you have a feeling that things will not end well.  I found that I was interested enough to watch the whole thing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I can spend hours on end playing it and I think that if your looking for a good time waster then this is your app
B008Y73940|4.0|This movie kept my interest and had a good plot. Could have developed more of the characters better, but overall a good movie.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I really don't know why people complain about the format. It is at heart a prequel to the wizard of oz. I will admit back in 1939 going to color was a way bigger deal then going to widescreen. I just like because the plot fits well with the old movie. I just think it deserves more credit for that and then again the wizard of oz was one of the first movies i was shown as a child stuck with me i guess any how 4 stars suck on it haters
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford gives a glimpse into life in the 1800's. The characters are wonderful and easy to fall in love with. The scenery is majestic and fits the time period perfectly. I love the way the show captures life in 2 different towns, and yet brings those towns together. It has become my favorite show.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun and simple game. I wanted a free four wheeling game and gave this one shot. Now I am hooked. Lots of fun and easy to learn.
B001CEE1W6|1.0|When I received the DVD it looked fine, but once I put it into my DVD player, it claimed that it was unreadable. I would not recommend buying from this seller. I was VERY dissapointed.
B003SI6C4O|4.0|This movie is worth checking out. The topic is interesting. It is exciting and imaginative. A good movie to plan on seeing more than once.
006114665X|5.0|Clark's unbelievable research has exposed incredible perspectives on the true sources of this conflict, which will make you (like me) feel ridiculous for accepting the old myth of &#34;bad&#34; Austria-Hungary&#34; bullying &#34;poor&#34; little Serbia.<br /><br />I've studied this conflict intensely for 40 years, and this entire book was a well-written, readable revelation. The scholarship and research is apparent and amazing. &#34;Guns of August&#34; is the de facto masterpiece, and although a number of Tuchman's premises have been discredited over the years it remains the standard. John Mosier's &#34;The Myth of the Great War&#34; exposes the stupidity of the Allied command and how (without our intervention) Germany would have triumphed. Each of these three is a paradigm shifter in terms of how we view and understand the struggle.<br /><br />I believe &#34;Sleepwalkers&#34; is a must-read if one has any true interest in this part of history.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Love every song on this album.  Bought it based on a recommendation on Google Play because I had listened to Carry On over and over again.  Much happier I have the whole album now :)
B000X2H8G4|3.0|It also picks up a bit more background noise than I had hoped for at this price. Check out the &#34;ear glasses&#34; here on Amazon. Cost next to nothing and improved my hearing 15-20%. I'll save this for the car since it is my right ear that is deaf and I haven't heard my wife since we drove in Ireland.
1608871045|5.0|This makes a great coffee table book!  It has a lot of info on the inside and a lot of pull outs/inserts that make this book a fascinating read.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I needed a bag like another hole in my lens but I has some refund points and scored this bag for 52 cents. I am completely happy with it and now use it (along with a Pelican box) for my every day kit. It is sturdy, well laid out and very easy to carry. Even at full retail, it outscores more expensive named brand bags and believe me, I know and now have a collection of them sitting in the closet.<br />Amazon really did us a good turn on this one.
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|I'm not into writing movie reviews, so if you like the movie you will enjoy the blu-ray 3D disc.<br /><br />With it not being a combo pack (overlooked that when I preordered it), it left me a bit disappointing.  I had to buy the 2D disc for $5.99 extra and now have to wait for it to come in.  I am hoping the promo 2D disc will have the special features as the 3D disc has nothing extra.
1401311091|5.0|Can not say enough about these books.  They can be read again and you would find them enjoyable.  Have read all the Nicki Heat books.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|I bit the bullet and purchased a price gouger's copy of this sublime collection new. They really should be strung up for profiting so egregiously on a limited-run box set, but, then again, they wouldn't do it if people like me can't resist getting their hands on such an awesome collection. These cuts are varied and really give a beautiful retrospective of this incandescent guitarist's all-too-brief recording career. Duane really did serve as a catalyst on many of these legendary artists' cuts, making them a better, more rounded overall presentation. His arrangements were simply incredible. The CD sleeves are flimsy, as other commenters have noted, but that's no big whoop....I appreciate the concept of the guitar string sleeves. Some of these songs are jaw dropping in their soulful expression of Skydog's chops. Really, really good. If you can afford it (and I barely could), I can almost guarantee that you won't be looking back on the purchase with anything nearing regret.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Great date movie, if your significant other likes action and a little humor.  We love Bruce W and having him team up with all the other guys was great.  Good script/storyline really helped, too.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Looks good on the nexus 7. Fun to play if you like seak and find games. Graphics are pretty good.
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|Enjoyed this movie.  Lots of action and relatively clean for family.  I usually do not like Cruise, but do like the MI series.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Initially I couldn't figure out why I couldn't download the game until I realized I needed mode internal storage memory than I had available at the time. Game takes about 185MB of space. I deleted a few things to get it on my HTC Incredible 2 running v3.2 Gingerbread. I know the phone is a a little old. Now my phone internal storage is low. I went to manage the app to move it to my SD card (external storage) and the option is grayed out?!? What gives? This needs to be fixed. Outside of that one complaint, the game seems interesting and has a lot of potential to be fun. I like how you can write almost anything in and it creates it. Interesting way to allow open ended solutions to solve problems. Pretty cool. I had to delete it and wait hoping they fix the storage issue. I did get a warning it wasn't tested for my phone yet, but moving it should be a basic option. It could be my phone, but more likely the app?
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|After all the hype and talk about the movie, I was afraid I'd be somewhat disappointed in it.  But turns out, it was better than I expected.  Decent acting and storyline, possibly predicting our own future (?).
B003V2HWP0|4.0|Firelight - a period romance. I really liked this movie because although the plot was unbelievable the acting made it worth the watch. Husband needs heir, seeks lady in need of money they have a three day breeding process in which after the first day they find themselves attracted to each other. However as arranged he leaves. Cut to scene of her giving birth and giving up her daughter. Each year goes by and she keeps a picture diary for her daughter. Seven years later she finally tracks down her daughter and signs on as a governess - you can guess the rest, bumps off comatose wife and they ride off into the sunset with jilted ex-wifes sister singing the blues.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Very good movie with good acting and story.  Lots of action and relatively clean for family.  I think there may be one scene you have to be careful of.  But overall very good.
0979019710|5.0|Book is great and it works. It's 6:10am and I am writing this. Been up for thirty minutes.  I now jump start my day with exercise, reading and answering my emails.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The storyline is well thoughtout and provides a great avenue for storyline expansion.  I felt the book (s) did not develop the story as throughly as possible and the writing was, on occasion, plodding  and in other areas of the story rushed.  It is certainly not a bad book for the price and I will most likely read this author again.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|its nice when your reading a series and the story still keeps you drawn into it most books don't, this one does
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Would regularly crash for me on Kindle. On debugging, this turned out to be permissions related issue. Was a horrible experience for me.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|The premise of the series is very well devised and the contrapuntal qualities of the two lead actors is very interesting.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Watched Columbo when it was on the first time and it's been so long since then that it's almost like watching new episodes of the show. Falk was the most entertaining actor on T.V. in the 70's. I never watched any cop shows on tv during the last 30 years except for &#34;MONK&#34;.  The two shows had a lot of similarities. The Columbo dvd set is a great buy and you won't regret it .
B0098460O4|5.0|I usually don't listen to opera but these two are unbelievable!!<br />Every once in a while God sends his angels wrapped  in unsuspecting packages.<br />These two angelic voices are meant to sing together to brighten our lifes.
0345803493|5.0|I heard about the first book and decided to buy it.  I was hooked from the first page! I thought the book series was so good, that I made my coworkers read each one after I was finished with it and give me a book reports!
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|I liked this movie. It was not the typical head exploding, guts all over zombie movie. Don't get me wrong, I do like the later as well. But if you want a scary movie with a chick flick twist, then  this is the one for you.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Terrible book.  Has no plot at all.  Sylvia Day had to get the book out and just threw a lot of nothing on paper.  If you don't have a story just admit it.  You have lost the respect of the readers and it looks like you need money.  Why didn't you finish this series as promised and start a new story.  Have pride in your work!  I returned my book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game will help the player cultivate patience.  That, or it will cause the player frustration and quicly get deleted.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, but after watching the first episode, I fell in love. This series is amazing! Tatiana Maslany is perfect!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I went with my gut feeling while purchasing this mouse. I knew all these reviews couldn't be wrong. Sure enough the reviews didn't disappoint. I would recommend this mouse to anyone!!! The feel of the mouse is like a cross between a Razer naga and a corsair vengeance. Both of which I've owned. The software to program the mouse is easy to use and works without a hitch! The clicks are crisp and the scrolling is stunning. A+ 100% rating for this mouse.
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|Critics have lost thier marbles giving this boring, weak story line any type of high rating. It's twilight meets zombies except I would call them zombies, seems people got infected with a desease that turns them into cannibal vegetables and love for a trailer girl some cures them and are able to be taught how to be human again. Weak, stupid, please stop fruitifying my child hood monsters.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Eureka is the best. It is SyFy at its best, the characters are easy to warm up to and follow. It can be hard or is hard to follow the technology referred to but is very entertaining at the same time. It is almost subliminal education to a world a cut above normal every day life.
B002NN5F7A|2.0|This movie is full of foul language and moves very slowly.  The movie was depressing and the ending seemed appropriate, it just died.  What a dissapointment, albeit, the movies was full of incredible actors.
1603420398|5.0|I love to crochet, and  especially  granny square afghans.  this just opens new doors for more designed afghans to make.  thank you
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|movie was good but as with a few others, the volume on rear speaker tv's was at max and still muffled.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|still sounds like megadeth but with a more up to date feel to it. every song is good. a must buy.
B0007939NO|5.0|I love it....its a musical love story. Both Gene and Cyd Charisse were great. Great dancers ! Nothing more to say.
B0073CCYAM|3.0|My son still loved the toy. good quality. Just didnt know this was going to be the size of a hot wheel.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Howard Shore dazzles with the album for The Hobbit 1. The fluidity and harmony of his arrangements and compositions is breathtaking. At first I thought it would be really similar to the LOTR albums (which I wouldn't really have had a problem with), but it turns out that he has made entirely new identities for the Hobbit. The dwarves' theme is obviously the centerpiece for this album, and it can be both powerful and subtle at different points in the movie. Some of my favorite tracks include \\"Over Hill,\\" \\"A Good Omen,\\" \\"Erebor,\\" \\"The Dwarf Lords,\\" and \\"The Edge of the Wild.\\"
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Great series.  Watched the whole thing with no issues on discs or anything. I like how it has an episode guide and guide to Gilmore-isms and some discs have bonus features.
B00BHMF578|3.0|I watched this AFTER it won numerous awards, so my expectations may have been unrealistically high. To me, it was just an OK movie. Not great and not award-winning. Also, it didn't help that I'd already read the magazine article and book that the movie is based on and so I knew the true story and knew that the movie strays far from the truth. Essentially, the movie is what COULD have happened, but in reality didn't. One of the few factual events in the movie also is one of the most far-fetched. Yes, they did all get drunk the night before they left for the airport. My wife said, &#34;That's just silly.&#34; But according to all accounts, it did happen. But very little else in this movie really happened the way it is portrayed. Stuff like that irks me. Just promote it as an action thriller loosely based on true events. That's what it is.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I cannot believe this. I just spent $9.99 on porn. Nothing but more unanswered questions. I am kicking myself for wasting my time.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Some of the switching back and forth between universes, the use of &#34;dopplegangers&#34; with very different personalities, etc can be a bit confusing although, the most confusing thing is to have the reappearance of a character which has previously died off!), but overall, I continue to find Fringe as compelling as ever....
B001EC3JME|5.0|I bought this unit to house my tactical 3AAA LED light. After having it about 2 weeks, the clip broke. I just notified the company last night and I promptly received an email back from Alejandra in Customer Service. They immediately stepped up & wanted to send me a new unit. Wow!! This is great customer service. They really back their product & will send you a new one if its not up to par.<br /><br />Thanks Nite Ize. You guys rock!!
B00001U0DP|5.0|Saw this movie at a hotel but only at the end. Therefore, I decided to purchase the movie. Loved it very much. I hope someone does a sequel soon. The movie is dubbed in English so you have to be a fast reader to understand everything but you can almost just watch the acting to understand what is going on.
B00112GVFO|5.0|Don't ya just love Matthew.  I bought this movie for my Kindle so I can watch it boating.  It's a movie I can watch over and over again.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I love stories set in Ireland.<br />I wondered how the story would end because the 2 main characters were too dissimilar to ever marry. I loved the ending - a perfect solution for these two.
B003I55BIA|5.0|But I loved this book, I was reading it in between breaks at work read it in less than 4-5 days, it's true the words Alex uses are kind of corny but I really enjoyed the love story!!!
0345529057|5.0|I can't believe how fast i received this order. The writing is fairly small but it is an awesome series. The size of the books are good to have them on a shelf and it doesn't take a lot of space.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|This watch is awesome, the big face, the dials on the left side, it is everything i ever wanted in a watch.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The game has gone through a major content update; there is a new location to explore and Rainbow Dash and Rarity (who are required to beat the game) are not as expensive as they once were. The option to buy lots of gems (lots of gems=lots of money) is still there though. The main reviews for the app no longer accurately portray the game due to the update, and new post-update reviews should be on the front page of the app.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun and easy to play, a great sequel to the franchise. Cant wait to play the new angry birds friends.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I love this show! It's a unique drama about a serial killer who goes after bad guys. Personalties of the show's main characters are diverse and it's fun to watch how they interact with each other. A lot of humor is mixed in with each episode.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really addictive and good fun, enjoy that there are no tips or hints.An ideal game for wasting away a bit of spare time.
B000TERK14|4.0|I have always been a fan of Thirty Seconds to Mars and this album was just another reason why.  Love their sound; love their songs!!
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I used to swim all the time, but eventually staring at the black line at the bottom hours a week got to me. I loved the way swimming made me feel, but always got a little bored doing it. I switched to running and other types of exercise for a while, and then my friend told me about the Neptune. I just got it and swam 4 days last week, and went farther than I ever used to! The sound quality is great and when I get into a song I forget I'm even swimming sometimes. Definitely recommend
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is the best game I have ever owned! There is no problems with this game. Restaurant Story is a very addictive!!! LOVE THIS GAME!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great game!! Would be better if there was a way to earn game dollars earlier in the game. Otherwise, GREAT GAME!!
B008JJM88Q|4.0|I think its really cool and i think its kind of weird how it knows the exact thing you are thinking
B005S9EJ14|5.0|A movie centered primarily around senior citizens and their challenges, there is also the contrast to a man emerging into adulthood--his love, his hope for success, his establishing himself as a man with his mother.  Cast primarily in colorful India there are captivating visuals, stirring music tracks and a satisfying, warm feeling when you reach the end.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I lobe that it's so easy to get to a new level so you get more gems. You should totally get the game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the series can't wait for the next one!!!! I did not like how the end left us hanging :(  any idea how long we have to wait???
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I feel like the first two books were better.  I have been waiting for this to come out and it just feels like a lot of it is filler and unnecessary and just drags the same issues out for too long.  Still a good read but I was a little disappointed.
B006T5FDLG|3.0|The songs are great, but they're UNFINISHED. Listen to these right after Death Magnetic and it sounds like they were recorded with a Fischer Price recorder. These 4 songs sound lifeless and flat compared to Death Magnetic. I don't get it. Why not remaster them to the same quality as Death Magnetic?<br /><br />I'm not sure who to blame, either the band or the label. But there's no excuse for this.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Sean is very good.  Josh's character does the stupidest things.  Kinda hard to get over that.  Cool LA pictures and great art direction.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I had a similar experience but did not travel as far as Dr. Alexander.  It made me realize that I was not imaging what happen to me.<br />I realized that Dr. A had to be clinical to try and make believes out of the scientific world, and that part was hard to get through since<br />I had to look up a lot of the clinical text.
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|This is very useful. I have it on two tablets and my smartphone. They all work very well with it.
B009R659L8|4.0|thought it was okay...was expecting a bit more suspense...but would recommend for someone<br />else to read the book...MHC books usually are predictable
B008OOYALE|2.0|Perhaps I read the summary of this app wrong, but I thought it was a &#34;dragon story&#34; not a game called &#34;Dragon Story&#34;. My son likes it, but it is not what I wanted and he doesn't play it that often.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I don't mind having to think about plots, in fact I rather prefer it. The spider-web was tough to follow at times and at the end I was left scratching my head. As big of fans as I am for this cast, I wouldn't recommend this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Really Sylvia day! Hating how 50 shades sequence this is. Also we have read three books so far you could have given us less sexual thrill and more dramatic details!!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|This movie isn't trying to win any awards, it's just trying to entertain the hell out of you, and that's exactly what it's doing. I thought it was a great ride. Really happy I rented it.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I loved this as a teen and enjoyed it even more as an adult.<br />Would even read it again. Enjoy!
B00005Q66Y|5.0|The third movement of the Bruckner Eighth is music of astonishing beauty. In my opinion, it's one of the high water marks in all of music. This performance of the Eighth is simply perfect. Bruckner would weep with joy if, by some magic, he could hear it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A great story that makes you rethink your ideas about a sensitive topic.you can't put it down once you start it. Very compelling.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Amazing app always works, I never have any problems with it and I can read so many books on it
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Our daughters and my wife loved this movie. It is a great family movie that has the attention of all ages. Our youngest watched it 3 days in a row...
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Helps me sleep. I got this as a free app of the day and i haven't stopped using it since. The nature ones sound legit. Love the rain forest one!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Had lots of fun even in the dark and even with the kids can't wait to get to the next levels
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think you should keep up your good work with this game and keep upgrading to nice places good luck.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|makes me want to live in the ocean and wait for my psoriasis to advance to scaling so i can be a mermaid.
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|I'm a Bocelli fan, but these modern songs and duets really made me wish he had stuck to his solos and Opera arias.<br />Amazon gives the best pricing and best delivery, but this is one Bocelli CD I wish I had skipped in  my eagerness to obtain.
B007N8RULO|5.0|needed something to do while sitting and waiting to be seen at the doctors office.<br />I get there early and their always late,so there is alot of whasted time to cover.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is honestly one of the best books I've read in a while. A great story that entices you making it hard to put the book down.
B009O2XY12|5.0|fun game I enjoy playing this one.<br />it's a good time waster.<br />just like having to coming up with enough words to<br />complete this review.
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|I like this movie because of the mystery it provided and the fact that Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt  other DVDs I have viewed are DAVE that features Bonnie Hunt and GooD Morning Vietnam withe Robin williams
B0094BB4TW|1.0|total waste of time<br />I only keep it cause the boss (wife)says to.<br />there seems to be alot of very lonely people out there with nothing to do<br />but tell the world about thier massed-up lives.<br />and to let everyone know how bad my spelling is.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|Very unique storyline.  Loved the characters.  Extremely well written.  Author takes a complicated plot and makes it easy to read.  One of the best summer reads.  I was &#34;Lucky&#34; to choose it as part of my collection.
B0000067L3|5.0|I remember when this double LP came out with  VERY shiny grey cover; (subsequent albums were dull guy-cheapskates in accounting probably checked how much the shiny cover costs). Nevertheless this album is timeless (see Politician) and the musicianship is top notch
B005NAE04E|5.0|I don't know how he does it but I can't get enough of the fantastic worlds woven again and again by Neil Gaiman and if I had any criticism of this book it would be that I read it far too quickly and it has just left me wanting more...
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I originally purchased this on DVD, then HD-DVD and now Blu-ray and I have to say this is one of the most perfect discs ever recorded. The video is crystal clear, the audio is out of this world. If you like the Eagles and buy nothing else from the Eagles this is a MUST HAVE
B00785P2QC|4.0|Have a few of them on my kindle fire hd 7in. They all look and work great. Very addicting only downside is you have to pay to play unless you wait hours for more money. Still, the app is free which is a great price.
B000069KGM|5.0|When I first heard this double LP (yeah, I'm that &#34;old&#34;) I said omigod is this not THE most perfect bunch of musicians that ever got together in a garage and decided to bang out an album. 1 star to the Chicago Transit Authority for threatening to sue them. What were these guys going to do? NOT make the subways run on time?
B00127RAJY|4.0|It's Jillian .... need I say more, great workout, allows you to adjust to your speed and work at your own pace
B005544V6A|5.0|I really like to interplay between the main characters and the story line is very good.  It's one of those shows that you can watch more the once and still enjoy it.
B0098460O4|4.0|love the voices and the music even though i am not a classical music fan; relaxing and fresh though old stuff :)
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I lived through this era and studied it in school. I learned more history than my teachers knew.<br />Wish it would not have been so much of a soap opera, but Follett did get his stories across.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I loved it!  It is very exciting and the plot is great every episode.  I strongly recommend it to Amazon customers
B0040HO01Y|5.0|What could be better than  favorite Brit actors in such a cozy and charming series? It is all lovely; the landscapes should be noted especially--stunning Oxfordshire market towns and wide farmland vistas enhance the authentic feel of place, though they were actually filmed in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. Much attention was paid to the authenticity of the scenery and it so contributes the the overall quality of the filming.  Costumes are excellent and the acting and direction superb. Based on the semi-autobiographical novels of Flora Thompson, these faithfully rendered stories charm and entertain. The stories are surprisingly piquant as they portray life sagas of the entire populous from lowliest laboring class to the lord of the manor. I love seeing the actors from Absolutely Fabulous (Julia Sawalha, Dawn French) in these so-very-different from Ab-Fab roles.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|This thing never worked.  I bought it for a flight to Hawaii, didn't have time to do a return so just tossed it in the corner and there it still sits.  The instructions are slight larger than a postage stamp, and in several languages.  The charging light was flashing then on steady, guess that was good, but it still never worked.  The instructions don't cover that part.<br /><br />It's not even big enough to be a good paperweight.  Nice shiny finish, bad instructions, didn't work.  A total loss for me.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|only grip the battery may die in a few phone but it provides decent stamina listening<br /><br />it make even crappy headphone sound good.<br /><br />thinking of getting desktop one, for my logitech x504 5.1
0307346617|5.0|Read the book as fast as i could. Deffinately an awesome story hope the movie is as good as the book.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|love this game and now am loving teaching the kiddos not only can we play by in the pool we can play inside and not worry about the little ones killing them
B00CN8U60Q|5.0|As always, Blackmore's Night pulls out another fantastic studio album, with a good mix of various styles & sounds that fans have come to expect from such an eclectic band. This album gets a little further away from the Medieval/Renaissance styling of their earlier work & has a more Eastern European feel to it. Also, we tend to hear more guitar from Ritchie on this album & less mandolin as on previous albums. This is by no means a complaint! The man is a genius regardless of the instrument his strings are attached to & I like that each of their albums has different sounds to it yet still remains consistently \\"Blackmore's Night\\". I honestly can't pick a favorite track, but several stand out for me, particularly \\"Carry On...Jon\\", a heart-wrenching guitar piece dedicated to Ritchie's former Deep Purple band mate Jon Lord who passed away last year. The song is truly a spiritual experience, overflowing with 40 years worth of friendship & conflict, joy & pain, frustration & respect, & honor & grief.It brings tears to my eyes listening to it. As for Candice - phenomenal as always! I hate how so many reviewers (primarily DP & BR fans who can't let go) get down on Candi. She is an amazing performer, talented songstress & beautiful lyricist, not to mention a very sweet person. & obviously Ritchie thinks so too or else, being the perfectionist he is, he wouldn't still be with her after 20+ years, not to mention recording & touring with her. But, I digress. I have noticed that on the last couple BN albums Candi's voice has taken on a fuller, more sultry tone (vocal lessons, maybe???) which has also given the songs as a whole a richer sound. Whether doing a traditional folk song, a love ballad, or a revival of a Rainbow classic, she pulls it off beautifully! Love her, love Ritchie, love the band, love this album! Another winner, guys! Thank you so very much! :)
B0012CH350|5.0|This cover fits great on my new Masterbuilt 7 in 1 smokers! Fits it perfect even though it says Weber. It seems very sturdy so far and not a bad price!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Never saw the movie so now I look<br />forward to seeing the movie.  LOVEd the ending.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|As the bodies pile up, Castle keeps you guessing as to how they are all tied together!  As Heat goes one direction, the writer hoes the other, coming together in the ends. Well done.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Just got this and ripped it to my computer,  Transferrred it to all my devices. Not a bit of problem with a used cd.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Archer always tells a good story. I thought that this was the last in the Clifton Chronicles but once again we were left with a cliff hanger.<br />I look forward to the next installment.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Been basing life decision on this book for over 12 years. I share the book often and this is probably my 8th or 9th copy as I always end up passing it on to others.
B008M721MS|1.0|Spent two hours trying to get Skype on Kindle Fire. Gave up. It should be simple but it just does not work.
B00957T6X6|5.0|love this book, I have a hard time putting it down, It is well written and the show is something  we look forward to every week.
B0009DBXXG|5.0|I perfect condition as well. I'm a big fan of Bernstein and this DVD is a welcome addition to my collection.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Beautiful cinematography and period costumes; this version closely follows the social mores of the era and their interpretation by  Jane Austen. My only complaints is that the kiss: I still want it to be more passionate, but it would modernize the ending. &#34;I am content&#34;.
1451695195|5.0|Very interesting book. I highly recommend it, easy read, sad, hopeful and inspires me. Give it a read, you won't be sorry, but be ready as it is not a \\"how to\\" book nor does it reveal the secrets of the universe or anything, but gives you an idea of what may be beyond this life. It fits with everything I think it will be... funny thing is, we will all find out one day what the truth is!<br /><br />Look, I believe in God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost. I am disturbed by the rebuttal books to this book, how can you rebut someones personal experience when you haven't even had a NDE anyhow? For Christians to say this book doesn't fit their belief system, it does, you just don't see it. I honestly do not know if this was a real experience or not, but it sounds like what I would expect with the exception that is sounds like he started out in Hell and moved up... Can you be stuck there forever or what? I dunno because I would like to think there are cosmic consequences for the likes of Hitler and such, but we never have those answers, but the book makes it sound like everyone gets in.<br /><br />As faithful as I am I have a hard time believing the Bible is the exact word of God, sorry, but consider the simple fact that we know the Earth is more than 6,000 years old, but did you consider that maybe God's time is a different scale than ours? So, maybe the Earth is only 6KL years old, in God time... 4 billion years for us. Heck, just read Leviticus and tell me this is the God of peace and love, see what I mean? BTW, I read the Bible so, whatever.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I gave it a five star because becoming spoiled by modern special effects, I hadn't been able to watch the original Star Trek (I know, a blasphemy.) My kids are now Trekkies. LL&P
141659521X|4.0|I love the Mitch Rapp series so I buy all of them.  Some of these tend to be more political on the right but I read it for the entertainment so I ignore the authors subliminal message.
0345803485|5.0|But wish I could say the same about volume 2. Just can't get into it for some reason. But I will keep reading, just to see if my hypothesis is correct!!
1416955070|4.0|Bought this book because I saw that the movie is coming out.  Read it in a couple of days.  Found out that it is 1 of 3 parts so now I have to buy the other books.<br />Was confused because there is another book with same title by different author but this one is the one the movie is based on.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|This is not only a good story and engaging in true Grisham style, but supports morals while encouraging young minds to make a difference in their world.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Deeply enjoyed this book.  I was pretty impressed that there would be teens capable of such diction and thought, but perhaps facing one's mortality forces that...
B00000IQC8|5.0|Love kevin he was originally gonna play dante but was scared he couldn't memorize all the dialogue so he recast hiself as silent bob. Anyway good quality copy i suggest purchasing through this seller.
B002PEP4C8|3.0|good beginning, but the end turns into a plain summary of her life.  I did enjoy the first 2/3 of it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|my husband and i are catching up on previous season that we hadn't watched. Great fun catching up on characters.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This CD by Blake Shelton is one that I have enjoyed listening to from beginning to end.  The music is fun, loving, soulful, and wild.  Never tire of listening to it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Loved it and I never realized I missed so much of this show. Great to watch eithout commercials as well..couldn't stop watching
B007HO392S|5.0|As usual, Carrie does an excellent job with this blow-out CD and brings everything she's got.  You will not regret purchasing it.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|After &#34;Lord of The Rings&#34; trilogy,...the prequel being an addendum  puts it in a position of &#34; actually a very hard act to follow&#34;!<br />By no means do I want to say anything bad about this movie!!...but it is the curse of &#34;desk clerk brother&#34; of a superstar athlete!<br />No matter how good a clerk you might be,...the magnitude of your sibling(s) will always leave you in a shadow !
B002NPUCIA|5.0|New of Brian, listened some of the music. Went to Newport Bch Festival this yr 2013 was blown away. Came home could not wait to get some of the cds. Then I ran across this Live CD/DVD.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|It left me bewildered, disturbed, wanting explanation!!!!! Exactly what they wanted!!!<br />The seemingly explanatory(prequel) expedition as to how &#34;Alien&#34;, &#34;Aliens&#34; and so on happened to come about left<br />me howling due to the fact of just the right amount of stimulant was applied to my Sci Fi nerve endings!!!Leaving me<br />a raving,....waiting for a sequel SciFi fan !!! Ehm....maybe a loon :-P
B0097HC8MK|4.0|People are for the most part what they choose themselves.  It is sad and miracles sometimes happen, but the reality is that for the most part a person is responsible for and must accept the outcome of his/her life.
