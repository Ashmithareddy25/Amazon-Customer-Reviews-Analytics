B006UG90RM|3.0|I was really excited to get the new VH cd but am a little disappointed once I finally gave it a listen to. I gave it 3 stars out of 5 because I only like half of the songs on it the rest are just filler songs. Eddie is amazing throughout the entire cd, I just wish the songs themselves were better. The titles to the songs gave me false hope once I actually heard them such as \\"Beats Workin\\", \\"HoneyBabySweetieDoll\\", and \\"Outta Space\\". To me the standout track on the entire cd is \\"Blood and Fire\\" and \\"Big River\\" is a great song as well. Let's face it DLR is not the same as he once was 28 years ago and it shows, yes he tries to mimick himself in some of the songs and doesn't do a bad job doing it but theres something missing with his vocals because he's not twenty something and he'll never be again. I love the little talking parts he does in the songs because thats his signature, his style just wished they were better written and sung. Kudos to the great Eddie Van Halen but I miss Sammy and Micheal Anthony.
1423140591|3.0|Ok. Lets start off by saying i am a huge PJ series fan.  I have already read the 1st book in this series and every PJ series book.  In all honesty, this is Rick Riordan's worst book in his collection.  Here are my negatives.<br /><br />1.  The time spent at the Roman Camp and with his (Percy's) new fellow campers is so extremely rushed, you have little to know \\"connection\\" or \\"love\\" for the camp and its campers.  Sure, the description of the camp is very detailed, but it lacks depth and character.  The reader should feel like they are experiencing it for themselves, not just looking at it from a distance.  At least with Riordan's previous books, we got a feel and certain \\"love\\" for Camp Half-Blood and the unique and diverse characters involved in it.  Riordan does the opposite with the Roman Camp.  The characters in it are dull and forgettable ( I barely remember any ), and Percy clearly (it doesnt seem purposely) has such little involvement with the other campers that all of his \\"camaraderie\\"  with the Roman Camp seems lacking (even though he says he cares for them deeply). I can go on about it and such but ill stop here.<br /><br />2.  The protagonists (main characters: Frank and Hazel) aren't very likable. Honestly, this is the one book where there seemed to be extremely poor chemistry between percy, hazel, and frank.  Unlike with the other characters of Riordan's books, i did NOT fall in love with these characters.  It's hard to explain, but the story was a tough read because of my general disinterest in these characters.  They lacked depth and pure emotion. Sure it explained their backgrounds, but it didnt ever get personal enough for the reader to really love and root for them.  Even the little romance between Frank and hazel was boring.  These characters just simply very rushed and bland, causing disinterest.  (this is a huge reason why the book was difficult to stay interested in and finish).<br /><br />3.  Finally, i did not like the battle scenes or the very important crucial scenes of the book.  They were EXTREMELY rushed and not even close to being \\"fictionally believable\\" compared to his other books in the series.  The scenes were not epic at all, the battle was so short i believe it only took up a few pages and Riordan was just throwing out random sights of the battle.  I was actually pretty angry at this... i didnt read 500 or so pages to have these scenes rushed and very very very corny and cheesy (i know usually the battle scenes in previous books have a slight corniness to them, but this was just ridiculous).<br /><br />4. Typos and misspelling everywhere.<br /><br />...honestly, not sure what i really enjoyed about this book... but trust me, i'm not ever this harsh of a critic. i absolutely enjoyed his previous books. (don't mind my spelling, its late and i'm running on empty)....<br /><br />Comment if you want to put in some words, and click the button if this review helped or didn't help, ill be free to answer any questions you have!the book.

B006UG90RM|4.0|This is a very good return by one of the best bands in rock. there is not one bad song blood and fire rocks yes david your back
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I don't know what all the hub-bub is. I admit the overall premise is intriguing but the writing isn't anything special and I was bored throughout most of the book. I skimmed through a lot of it just to get the interesting parts. I also think it's pretty disturbing and not in a good way. Kids killing kids while people cheer them on doesn't sit right with me. Why this is marketed as a YA book is beyond me.
B005XLN97M|5.0|This took me 15 minutes to assemble & very popular already amongst the 4 girls.  The two high-backed chairs belong on the back of the house where the kitchen sink flips open to create the breakfast bar.  The spiral stairs are unique compared to the glamour house & other houses so that's of great interest for girls to make barbies walk up & down the stairs.  The bed flips open to become a double bed.  The color scheme & room in this beach house easily fits in with switching furniture from other barbie houses into this one.  Girls (ages 4 - 9) play with this house along with the other houses & barbie paraphenalia in the playroom.  The 8 & 9 year olds like to pretend they don't play barbie anymore because they're too sophisticated but when they think no one's watching, they're having fun along with their younger cousins).  Playtime with this house is about 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on whether they play alone or with others.  A welcome addition to the Barbie collection.  (Note: I was asked what I'll do with all of these Barbie toys when my step-granddaughters outgrow them.  My answer: save them for great-granddaughters of course!  Yes, my step-granddaughters thought this was a silly yet cool idea). I digress... anyway, I highly recommend this house.
0763644765|5.0|My son is 18 months. I'm not intensively potty training but wanted to start introducing the concept. He loves the book. I keep it in the bathroom and we read it every time he brushes his teeth. The author did a great job with keeping it simple and cute!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is so NICE.  It is beautiful, functional and really helps you hold your Kindle like a book.  It also protects it - it has a very soft inner lining that protects screen; the outer cover is leather like and exactly what I was looking for - something that looks like a book.  It has a nice pocket in side that I keep cleaning cloth in.  I may at a future date buy others of this brand for variety.  Love it!
145162445X|1.0|This is a wonderful explanation of the current state of cosmology. I am an avid enthusiast of the subject matter and learned a whole lot from the author's lucid effort. What I don't need though is the frequent indulgence in his pet agenda to trash religion and God. That has no place in a book like this. I was a fan of Christopher Hitchens and had no problem with him induldging in incisive trashing of all kinds of things but that is what he did for a living. So be it. But the author does not need to jump into the cat fight with theists and deists. Who cares. Leave them alone. Spiritual endeavour should not be a target of scientific scrutiny anyway. It really is unseemly and detracts from the book (albeit the author provide some good chuckles).  UPDATE: I decided to change my rating to 1 star. The author's mean-spirited atheist agenda ultimately ruins what is an otherwise outstanding read. Plus, I have now decided that his partner-in-crime, Christopher Hitchens, was a vile, miserable individual. I threw the book in the trash. I prefer to get my cosmology from nice guys like Brian Greene, thank you very much.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Awesome well worth getting.  The levels are hard. And some are easy. And the animations are the best. This is about 26 hours of fun.
B004VF68AQ|1.0|This is really bad! Why pay for a whole cd with only one great song on it, the irresistable force? I love this band, their is so much talent in this band but it does not show here! I realize these guys are a little older but there is no excuse for this !! Of my 500 plus cds that i own i never that i could remember just listening it 5 times and saying to myself that i just wasted time off my life!!Even the great porno for pyro band was on the mellow side and was really great!
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|\\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" by Australian indie artist Gotye (Wally de Backer) has become the surprise hit of early 2012 in the United States.  The song is currently the number one most popular track on Spotify.  Gotye is currently the most popular homegrown artist is Australia (arguably). From the looks of it, Gotye is on his way to becoming a popular artist in the U.S.<br /><br />In Australia, Gotye became a household name after releasing the critically and commercially successful album \\"Drawing Blood\\" in 2007.  Gotye has been compared to Sting and Peter Gabriel.  The comparisons are apt. Like Gabriel, Gotye's music is very experimental and textured. His singing delivery and voice is similar to Sting. \\"Making Mirrors\\", Gotye's third studio album, takes off where \\"Like Drawing Blood\\" left off.<br /><br />The aforementioned song (\\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\") is tale of a lost lover and draws on folk, pop, and electronic music.  It is the only song to feature guest vocals, that of New Zealand female singer Kimbra.<br /><br />The rest of the album also draws on a variety of styles and reflect on the range of emotions felt during love relationships. \\"Easy Way Out\\" is a 2 minute psychedelic tune. \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" is standard indie rock. \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" features the percussion of several instruments. \\"I Feel Better\\" is Gotye's take on Motown. \\"In Your Light\\" is sunny folk-pop with some techno beats and occasional horns.  \\"State of the Art\\" is auto-tuned reggae.  \\"Don't Worry, We'll Be Watching\\" and \\"Bronte\\" draws mainly on downtempo.<br /><br />Most of the songs on this album are great and Gotye is a good songwriter and has a nice voice.  \\"Making Mirrors\\" is the album that will make Gotye a household name outside of Australia and establish him as the next Sting or Peter Gabriel.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Played this on home computer and Apple products. Love it on all platforms. MobilityWare has a great selection of games.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|If I didn't give this a five star review, I wouldn't give anything a five star review, because this is honestly one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. The book was good, and this is one of those rare occasions when I'll say I don't know which one is better, the book or the movie. The movie did a masterful job of creating atmosphere and bringing characters to life, and with the intellectual and meaningful undertones, I found myself dazzled as I was inspired. Also, it's downright creepy as hell. I loved every part of this movie. Adults, children, it doesn't matter. Everyone should like this move. If you have kids, I'd definitely say buy it.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|it is cool an fun but warning needs wi-fi to play other than that it works great an looks awesome on my kindle fire
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played Spider for many years.  This version is smooth and easy to use.  I have not found any glitches.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i like this game because it has a lot of game options to play. i think that everyone should want to play this game. its awesome!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is perfect. Some reviewers complain it is flimsy, but it does the job perfectly.  It does not need to be any heavier since the Kindle Fire is indeed much heavier than the original Kindles.  It works every time, is easy to snap in, and keeps the screen protected when the Kindle is not in use.  Great way to watch movies by standing it up, lining it up in the slot, and leaving your hands free to do anything else you want them to be free to do. I highly recommend this less expensive alternative as a cover/protector.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Like many of the faithful, my expectations were not very high.  But instead of a safe, mature, and boring reunion album, the mighty VH slapped me upside the head with skill, style, and attitude intact.  Other reviewers have discussed the specific tracks.  But I'm not thinking about the details, or much of anything at all.  I'm just listening, with a big grin on my face.  Since listening to this album, my Camaro has started running better. And I can feel my mullet growing back.

The Fx-4100 seems to like 4.0GHz overclocking with stock cooling, the overclocking is unnecessary but I wanted to see what it could do.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app! It's fun, and passes the time by. However, there is a lot of advertisement, thus my lowering of a star.
B0055V0HXO|4.0|otherwise, this could be a perfect album.  Come on Inside Out, we know that you know.  And to make matters worse, the mp3 available on Amazon has the same defect.  With that exception, this is melodic prog at it's finest IMO.
B006UG90RM|5.0|My VH credentials:  8 years old and listening to 98 rock in Baltimore MD who seemed to play Zeppelin, The Who, The Beatles, The Stones and Skynyrd every hour use to always mix in bands like Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, Cheap Trick, The Doors, Supertramp, and yes, Van Halen.  At the age of 10, in 1980, I got VH 1 for Christmas and played it over and over.  I'd hang out in my room and crank side 1, then go to the basement and play with my new toys, then head back to my room to play side 2.  By 1982 I had all their albums except for 1984 which had not been released - that actually happened on December 31st, 1983 at 11:59pm - They owed the record to the record company by 1983 - so they waited until the last minute of the year.  Those first 6 albums have always been the soundtrack to my life, I have never stopped listening to them on a regular basis. VH was the first band where I had to have everything they released. Over the years WACF has become my favorite along with VHII.  Though I believe that Dave with VH is by far the best, I still was a faithful fan of the Sammy years, the first reunion debacle, the Gary years, the other reunion debacle (my God, \\"It's about time\\" is horrible, isn't it?).  Then 2007 gave me some hope and now, 5 years later, ADKOT.  It's difficult to compare this album with the first 6, hell 28 years have gone by.  But, I'm like that 10 year old kid cranking VH 1 on the old turntable, I can't get enough of the record - the songs, the energy, the feel, the musicality, the nod to the past with a new vibe.  I think Wolf deserves a lot of credit because he has injected a youthfulness into the band and they sound like they are having fun.  Of course, that is why VH one of the greatest - amazing guitar, amazing rhythm section, amazing front man - the music hits you like a sledge hammer and you want more because it feels so good.  By the way, Bullethead (a bootleg song I always loved) nails it.
0062011847|5.0|Great read!  Really enjoyed another Vines story, seeing the characters grow and deepen.  Really enjoyed the home stuff , the interaction with Sybil and Young Sam.  Also loved the peek at Willikins' psyche.  This ranks as one of the author's best, full of laugh out loud humor and sly social commentary, disguised as fantasy.

B0059XTTW8|4.0|The acting is impeccable. Gary Oldman completely disappears into the<br />role of Smiley; the voice, the walk, the tempo are all a unique<br />creation, a man who's strength comes from quiet, from watching, from<br />thinking, not from action. Rarely have we ever seen a movie hero this<br />passive. But this man is very actively passive.  He may not move<br />physically, but his mind is racing like a computer. And Oldman is<br />surrounded by a top flight cast;; Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt,<br />Ciaran Hinds, Benedict Cumberpatch, etc.<br /><br />The film is very well shot, delicately creating a dour world of beige<br />and brown mazes.<br /><br />But in distilling a story this complex down to two hours, something got<br />a little lost for me. Smiley has to figure out who the mole in the<br />British secret service is. But with this much plot, and this little<br />time, we don't really get to know the suspects. So we watch and are<br />(intentionally) confused, and then answers start to emerge, and it's<br />all never less than interesting. But somehow it never crosses over into<br />the emotional or unshakably memorable either.<br /><br />I loved Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In' for it's uncanny combination<br />of atmosphere, creepiness, intelligence and heart. For me, 'Tinker,<br />Tailor...\\" has the first three, but lacks the last. Some of that is the<br />nature of LaCarre's work. But somehow I remember more moments, and more<br />feeling from the now 30+ year old TV adaptation, even though it didn't come<br />close to this new version's rich sense of style.  But by not having to rush<br />through a story this dense, there was room to really feel and experience it,<br />instead of just working to keep up with it.<br /><br />But all that said, this is a refreshingly smart, adult, well-made and<br />challenging film in a world with far too few.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I have had this case for nearly a month and I just love it. It doesn't add any bulk to the Kindle Fire. It fits nicely into my purse. I like that the case also comes with a strap so that the cover isn't moving around when stored away (example-in a bag). I would recommend it. I also love that its affordable. I don't need a fancy case, just one that gets the job done.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game has just the right difficulty and has a large amount of levels to last a while. Graphics are pleasant and everything is smooth and fluid. Well worth the money.
0312427999|3.0|I have had \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" sitting on my bedside table for almost two years.  I've always been meaning to read it but always put it off for other books.  I eventually bit the bullet.<br /><br />Naomi Klein writes very well.  Her prose is excellent.  The book flows well and she brings the threads of her argument together with seemingly little effort.  However, the basis of her argument is probably pushed too far. She sees disruption (eg coups, natural disasters, economic collapse, etc) as opportunities for governments to impose extreme market solutions.  In this regard, she does provide a number of good examples such as post-Pinochet Chile, Bolivia and post-Gorbachev Russia.  These disruptions provided the cover for so-called extreme economics.  Perhaps the best known is Chile where the \\"Chicago boys\\" imposed the notions of Milton Friedman directly upon an upturned country following the Pinochet coup.<br /><br />Yet while Klein argues a good point, she concludes on much weaker points.  In particular, she sees such leaders as Hugo Chavez as being counterpoints to the Chicago orthodoxy.  Not a good example.  As time has shown, Chavez is anything but a democrat and the Venezuelan economy is seriously fraying at the seams.  In other words, it is not possible to completely ignore markets.  Whether we like it or not, liberal social democracy always produces the best outcomes both in terms of standards of living and the avoidance of massive wealth discrepancies.  For some reason, Klein cannot sign on to this view.  It is here that her argument fails.<br /><br />So, overall, there is much to recommend in this book.  Klein's argument is well presented and clear.  However, her conclusions are weak.  She overdoes herself.  This is a shame.  The book has much to offer.  A poor conclusion detracts from all the previous quality research.
B006OAB3ME|2.0|The world correctly bows to the iconic Paul McCartney, but \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" is sadly lacking in tone, tempo and especially fun. McCartney seems afraid of the odd material he's chosen-- \\"Inch Worm?\\" When did \\"Inch Worm\\" become a \\"Standard?\\" \\"More I Cannot Wish You?\\" a lovely song from \\"Guys and Dolls\\" but a standard? I don't think so. Why not Cole Porter?  Sir Paul filled the room with musical giants and then didn't use them. Nobody can out-swing John Pizzarelli and Diana Krall, but on this CD they're kept on a very tight leash, providing mostly melodic fills behind McCartney's nearly Tiny Tim-like falsetto. Listen to Clapton's version of \\"My Very Good Friend the Milkman\\" and then Paul's. Ouch.  It's rumored McCartney once flirted with writing an album with Johnny Mercer, but to hear him deliver this leaden reading of Mercer's \\"Ac-cent-u-ate the Positive\\" I now wonder if he had ever heard the song before? Listen to Dr. John's great rendition from the 80s or Mercer's own recording from the 40s and you'll hear how much fun was left on the table.  Why hire a titan like Johnny Mandel to write charts and not have a brass section? Chuck Berghoffer played bass for Sinatra. Where's that attitude? Jeff Hamilton and John Clayton are jazz giants, and how about Poppa Pizzarelli, Bucky, who goes back to Benny Goodman for God's sake!  McCartney might as well have been singing with the synth player at the Akron, Ohio Marriott for all the use he made of these monster cats.  I've seen all of these players light up the stage and electrify audiences by taking chances with time and tempo. If only McCartney had let them jam and jumped onto the high-wire that makes jazz, jazz, he might have at least captured the spirit of the idiom despite his aging chops.
B000H5TH1Q|3.0|I first bought this movie several years ago at Best Buy on sale for about $3.99, but never actually got around to watching it all the way through until recently. I really enjoyed it-it was like watching an updated Hitchcock flick, and the music score was excellent. I may be mistaken, and if I am will somebody please correct me-but I'm almost positive that at around the 1 hour 18 min mark I'm sure I spotted actress Audrey Landers, of Dallas TV show fame, do a quick 2 second walkthru during the Frankie Goes To Hollywood music segment.
B004UAKAE2|1.0|Along with Downton Abbey.  UD doesn't stand up to either the acting or the set.  UD had a very 'set' feel, like the old westerns...or maybe like I Love Lucy...there's something to be said for more modern filmmaking.
1607882302|5.0|Zappos went from zero to over a billion dollars in a decade that saw 9-11, the banking crisis and a couple of recessions.  The author of this book (Tony Hsieh) was one of the key initial investors in Zappos and then the CEO for most of the decade.  The story is part Tony's personal biography and part business biography, but all interesting.  The company and Tony have a tremendous focus on service & \\"happiness\\" of customers and employees.  It seems like the kind of culture you dream about working in when you think about what you really want to be when you grow up.  Zappos supported the \\"happiness\\" through careful hiring practices, deliberate unconventional policies and Tony provides many stories of specific actions that have ensured engagement, openness and growth on the employee side.  I believe many organizations will evolve to become healthier as we gain the ability to make longer term consequences visible and proceduralize our best leaders' longer-term visions, but we need more examples like Zappos to shatter old paradigms that are at best no longer useful and at worst destructive.  I'm fully aware that we're not there yet, but this book provides a cool glimpse into the future that I'll be helping to create.

0545425115|5.0|I loved this book, not so much for myself as for my son, who never fell under the spell of Harry Potter but could not put down Hunger Games. Fast-paced, efficiently written, it's a terrific novel for younger readers.
B0071T5PN0|1.0|That's the first word that came to mind when attempting to describe this album. Painful. Painful to listen to. Painful to think about decent music by proven musicians being fronted by the ravings of a very \\"different\\" mind. Not saying that different is always bad, but come on. Just don't see how anyone can buy into this stuff 100%. I'm about to turn 43. The first cassette tape I ever owned was a bootleg copy of Van Halen 1. I played it until it broke, then fixed it. I don't claim to be an expert of all things rock, but really? This album makes it clear for me why they split in the first place. In their hayday, they were iconic. They are just too far apart now. The lyrics were just non-sensical all the way through. If that was what he was shooting for, then mission accomplished. Can you imagine any concert crowd trying to sing these lyrics back to the band at the show? There is no way. It isn't difficult to tell when a group is of a like minded groove, and when they aren't. The whole thing sounds forced. It is quite a reach for these guys. Believe me, I really wanted this to work. So did all of you, or you wouldn't be here. To see them find their old chemistry would have been the highlight of my year. I'm telling you, they will not gain any new fans with this. Only an experienced, beloved group could ever push this on a record label. These guys have cashed in every bit of clout they ever had. I hate it for them. Maybe Eddie's kid will get out from under the old man and pave his own way. Such a letdown for me. But then again, check the pen name.
0547258305|5.0|Great book to read! I enjoyed every second of it. It reminds me a bit of The Hunger Games trilogy that I have recently read. Graceling is filled with adventure and a bit or romance, which I liked. It was an easy read and I actually wished I could read more about Katsa (the main character) after finishing the book. Now I'm going to read Fire by the same author to find out what is going on with the other kingdoms...excited!

0060987464|3.0|i bought this to read because i was curious of Manson's childhood and if it had anything to do with his deviant lifestyle and blatant hatred towards not only christians but towards humanity in general. i gave it a 3 star because it is well written and it explains quite abit about why there is a Marilyn Manson, for that alone i could give it a 5. it is a 3 because i cannot agree with his thinking and way of life.<br /><br />Mason relates in his book that his during his childhood he was sickly and became a &quot;moma's boy and his father constantly reminded him that he was worthless and a failure. Where things were troublesome for him the most aparently, was in his school life. He explained that he went to a christian school and that the teacher brainwashed them with these terrifying concepts about the antichrist, the beast, and 666. He states on page 19, &quot;it was then that i started having nightmares---nightmares that continue to this day. I was throughly terrified by the idea of the end of the world and the Antichrist. So i became obsessed with it, watching movies like The Exorcist and The Omen an reading prophetic books like Centuries by Nostradomus, 1984 by George Orwell and the novelized version of the film A thief i the Night, which described very graphically people getting their heads cut off because they hadn't received 666 tattoos on their forehead. Combined with weekly harangues at christian school, it all made apocalypse seem so real, so tangible, so close that i was constantly haunted by dreams and worries about what would happen if i found out who the antichrist was.&quot;<br /><br />On pg. 22 He says, It confirmed what i had already known from the beginning--that i wouldn't be saved like everybody else. I knew it everyday when i left for school trembling with fear that the world would end, I wouldn't go to Heaven and i'd never seee my parents again. But after a year had passed, then another, then another, and the world and Mrs. Price (teacher) and Brian Warner adn the prostitutes who were born again were still there, i felt cheated and lied to. Gradually, i began to resent christian school and doubt everything I was told. It became clear that the suffering that they were praying to be released from was a suffering that they had imposed on themselves--and now us. the beast they lived in fear of was really themselves: It was man, not some mythological demon, that was going to destroy man in the end. And this beast had been created out of their fear. THE SEEDS OF WHO I AM NOW HAD BEEN PLANTED.&quot;<br /><br />He goes on to relate how he got heavy into rock, especially heavy metal and also dungeons and dragons which were forbidden fruit of the christian school which further fed his anarchy.<br /><br />On pg 31, he says, &quot;christian school had prepared me well for public school. It defined the taboos, then held then away at arms length, leaving me reaching for them in vain. As soon as i switched schools, it was all there for the taking---sex, drugs, rock, the occult. I didn't even have to look for them: they found me.&quot;<br /><br />Early in highschool, he got into black magic and stated on pg. 45 that he &quot;could use black magic to turn the lowly lot life had given me around--to attain a position of power that other people would envy and accomplish things that other people couldn't.&quot;<br /><br />His reasoning for calling himself manson are as follows on pg. 79, &quot; Manson was the perfect story protagonist for a frustrated writer like myself. He was a character who, because of his contempt for the world around him and, more so, himself, does everything he can to trick people into liking him. And then, once he wins their confidence, he uses it to destroy them.<br /><br />On pg. 213 he says, &quot;When my dreams about the antichrist began occuring more frequently later in life, i knew i was that figure.&quot;<br /><br />On pg. 219 he says, &quot; I can't even stand to watch people in restaurants laughing, having fun, enjoying life. Their pitiful happiness sickens me...I'd love to kill all of them, but i'd be doing them a favor. The worst punishment i can give them is to let them wake up every morning and lead their stupid f...g lives, let them raise their stupid f...g children and of course, make a record call AntiChrist Superstar, which will annoy and destroy each and every one of them. F... you America. The world spreads its legs for another f...g star...&quot; (amazon denied this review due to the f words so I had to delete them. Ironically, they will sell the book with profanity, but not allow the words to be quoted.)<br /><br />So in a nutshell, these quotes helped me to realize that Marilyn Manson's music is not for merely entertaining people. There is truly method behind his madness. He has a message for the world to hear. He is a prophet of doom and hatred. Although he has a point about americans and their blind worship for superstars, his contempt for humanity and life is blatant. 1Peter 5:8 says that Satan is as a roaring lion going about seeking those he may devour, this mindset sounds very much in harmony with the mindset of marilyn manson. Marilyn Mason is on an egotistical trip seeking for all the world to worship him.ing, having fun, enjoying life.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|This game freezes...on the FIRST board! Advertised as \\"Works with your device\\" and it does NOT! I love this game (have bought 2 copies) on my Windows machines, and was so excited to get it for my tablet...CRUSHED! I doubt I can \\"return\\" this game, but I am definitly going to try. Shame on you PopCap...Shame on you...<br /><br />&lt;EDITED 10 Feb 2012><br />Ok, I am revising my review. ASUS just pushed out an update to the Prime, and it appears to have fixed whatever issue PvZ had!!! YAY! So I recant my earlier review! The game is the same as the PC version, but that is what I expected. The images are pixelated on the 10\\" tablet, but it is not a made for tablet based game and for that, I give it a 4/5 stars. PopCap, I apologize for the earlier \\"Shame on you\\" comment, apparently it was a Prime issue. :)<br /><br />&lt;EDITED 29 Feb 2012><br />Its with a sad heart that I have to say that PvZ does not work with the Prime...again. I dont know what happened...but im done with it...lost my money...moving on...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this app. It has some nice games but I wish the games would unlock sooner. It has some nice classic games.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I wasnt a big fan of the first harry potter movies as they were a bit childish and tacky. This movie adds more of a dark element to the movie which adds good suspense and kept me engaged... I would recommend watching it, but only if you've seen the other ones... otherwise watch them all first!
1401201911|5.0|Many times I feel like a comic will be great the whole time, then they botch the ending for whatever reason, it was rushed, it didn't resolve, whatever. Red Son was wonderful the whole way through and absolutely stuck the ending! I will definitely read this one multiple times.

086571701X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Sylvia's book on aquaponics.  I thought I had a pretty good handle on how an aquaponics system works before purchasing the book, but learned that I could take my system to a whole new level of sophistication and simplicity all at the same time.  It was written well enough that I enjoyed reading it from start to finish, and at the same time it contains enough detailed information that I find myself referring back to it on a regular basis.  Sylvia has also been gracious enough to answer a few detailed questions I sent her way, and to also get me in contact with experts when my questions left her realm of expertise.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is thinking about starting an aquaponics system, or anyone who wants to improve a system already in place.
0307887960|5.0|I am 29 years old, about to be 30, and an ARMY OIF Veteran.  After I got out of the service in 2009 the lbs just kept pilling on.  I started the diet on September 26, 2011, after a weekend in NYC for a Yankees vs. Red Sox game.  I weighed about 265 lbs.  Within two months I was in the 230's, and down from squeezing into size 38 jeans and XL tee shirts, to swimming in 36s and all my L tee shirts again.  After the holidays, I am finally in good enough shape to log miles on the old treadmill.  The book is an easy read, but more geared towards the female readers.  But the diet is tailored for a man.  It is as if I am eating the lbs. away with the amount of protein I can eat in one meal.  I have turned my fair share of family and friends onto this diet, including my mother, whom I bought this book for.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|If you liked the original and appreciate better visuals and sound, this is going to do the trick. Simply looks amazing in 1080p, high-def makes a big difference for animated pictures. Pixar needs to take some notes.
B0011UBDTK|2.0|I was a little worried about purchasing this set because I had read the reviews from previous buyers saying there were problems with the disks. These reviews, however, were from around 2006. I was thinking that it didn't make sense that a product would still be sold to customers, 6 years later, knowing that it was faulty. Well I did not get through the entire series, but still came across two faulty disks from two separate seasons. The one episode would not play and all and just returned to the menu. The other, skipped and froze so much that it was not worth watching. It is very unfortunate that this problem has been known for so long, but yet the product is still being sold.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great app except the tap mode doesnt always respond otherwise a great app. great options i wish there was a pause button though
B0063GORYU|5.0|very good game to pass the time. 5 stars! I like playing it when I am bored or when waiting for appointments and such.
B0071T5PN0|2.0|I am a huge fan....but I want my ten bucks back. This is just NOT a good album. Waited so long for it and was not worth the wait. Both Chickenfoot albums are way better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great no gliches awsome good nice bomb nice because it is more games then you think your going to have in one game
0312576463|2.0|I found nothing to like about this book. I just finished it because I had spent money on it. The characters are non-believable and unlikeable. It's far fetched and tedious. I didn't care what happened to any of them. There was also some cheap melodramatic twists which are the hallmark of a bad book. I have no idea why this author enjoys a good reputation. Two friends who read a lot felt the same way I do. There's a lot better out there to spend your time on.
B005R5U5B2|5.0|I bought this CD for my 13 year old daughter. I was surprised how fast we got it from England. She has listened to it everytime we get in the car. I know all the words. I'm 50 and I know all the words to a boy band CD. The songs are good ,no profanity.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've got the wrong type of ears for earbuds, they keep falling out. And forcing other types of earbuds into my ear canal is uncomfortable to say the least. I do like conventional headphones, but I wanted something light for casual excursions. I was delighted to find these Sony headphones. They're very light and thin so I experience no fatigue wearing them. The speakers face forward which makes for excellent coupling to the ear. And they sound great, clear and full bodied especially at higher volumes. The clincher is the low price, so much so I bought a second one as backup.  Being light and thin is a plus, but being made of plastic means they're fragile (my perception). If you want headphones you can simply throw in your shoulder bag and forget about, I'd recommend looking at sturdier headphones. If you're like me and sort of pamper your equipment, then these are for you. I'm using the molded, clear plastic case the headphones came in to transport them (by cutting the plastic with a razor blade on the top and sides, where it meets the cardboard backing, so it hinges open).
B0067QPVD2|5.0|John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\" is my favorite film of all time so I was very skeptical about this movie.  I must say that I was extremely surprised and impressed!  I loved how they ended it - just pop in Carpenter's movie right after the credits and you've got an extended story that fits perfectly together.  If you're a horror fan you should give it a try.  Others might get nightmares.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app,  very easy to use and has been nothing but a joy in my life, I can't say enough good things about it!
1878424505|4.0|I truly enjoy this book - when it was suggested to me by my mentor and she talked to me a bit about what the book was about I expected it to be much longer - so when it arrived and turned out to be so short (I admit I didn't check how many pages there were before purchasing it via Amazon) I found myself skeptical.  My skepticism was however wasted because I actually liked it (though I finished it in a few short hours). This book gave me a lot to think about and inspired ideas for things I would like to change in myself and the way I view the world and what things I'm doing wrong in how I let situations affect me.  This book does have its downside in the respect that it tells you what you should do but doesn't give you steps as to how to get started. Reading it and agreeing with it is one thing but incorporating the ideas and practices into your life is a lot harder and even the author stresses more than once how hard these Four Agreements can be to work with when you're already programmed by life to react otherwise - so it would have added quite a bit of help to those who wish to follow these agreements had he done so.  All together though this is an excellent read and I'm glad that I bought it and have already suggested this book to friends.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use Evernote to sync to do lists, project plans, documents and receipts between devices. Love the checkbox option.  Permissions are invasive. Syncronization can be slow.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great app! no problems with my kindle. has good features, especially the hint option. settings are flexible and allow for various skill levels
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case might seem cheap a t first but is it my favorit so far.  All of the other cases I've used have been to bulky, latch doesn't work properly, or the exterior wore away.  This is the smallest and most durable case I've used.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the best solitaire game out there. Great graphics and click to move cards makes it an easy but challenging game to play.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Great stuff.  It was worth the waiting.  There is a little hint in Eddie's playing that sounds like the stuff Dave Roth did with Stevie Vai and I found that odd since we all know Eddie has his own one of a kind style, and according to Eddie he has an arsenal of great stuff waiting to be launched.  But that is just my opinion.  In general the album is great and full of energy.  It's got the VH roots, with lots of new shredding, a great mix of beats and sounds complemented with the unparalleled Diamond Dave's voice.  With all the crap music that infested the airwaves in the last few years, I was craving for some VH original music for so long that right now I don't have a favorite track - all songs sound great .  The rough energy in this new album is fueling and firing all my cylinders at this time.  I doubt that any of the songs will leave a landmark like \\"Running with the devil\\", \\"You really got me\\" or \\"Eruption\\" did, but I welcome the band back regardless, with hopes that this is only the start in picking-up where they left off.  This is a band that should have never broken up.  They cause huge sparks and large amounts of talent flows among themselves when they're together, and so hopefully there will be more to make up for the lost time.  Too bad they think that Michael Anthony should not be part of this band anymore.  I miss his style in this album and his great background vocals.  Eddie....just like you, Dave, and Alex, Michael helped chiseling away the formation of this your great band.  Bring Michael Anthony back on bass, and just expand the band.  The more talent-the better for the fans.  Wolfie is a great bassist, we love him and we welcome him too.  He fills in perfectly in VH, but he's no Michael Anthony (at least not yet).  Wolfgang too, with time will build up his chops and attain his place up there with the great ones....maybe playing GREAT six-strings just like dad do, and let M.A. back on bass?  THAT WOULD BE IDEAL-THE ORIGINAL LINE UP WITH MORE VAN HALEN D.N.A. IN THE MIX.  But for now, we'll be appeased for a little while.  Volume button back to MAX now!!!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I updated but no new levels were there. Weird. I need updates! If any of you still have ads (not a problem I've had)  just turn off your wifi while playing. Saves battery too.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It reminded me of Myst  The puzzels are just challenging enough, the music &amp; graphics excellent.  Well worth the money
B0019GJ4EM|5.0|This is a another great John Carpenter movie and Kurt Russell gives a classic performance as the cult icon Snake Plissken.  With a cast that includes Issac Hayes, Lee Van Cleef, Donald Pleasence, Harry Dean Stanton and the great Ernest Borgnine it's a must see for any sci-fi/action movie fans.
0824835921|2.0|*  My opinion of the usefulness of this book has somewhat improved - my thanks to the critics of my early uninformed view.    I have now written free web app's to go with this Heisig mnemonics book. They are at kanji.aule-browser.com - particularly in the 'Curl' desktop applications.    A new variant of the Heisig-only app was added yesterday and the Heisig indices are found on two other app's,    I still prefer Henshall's mnemonics - a matter of taste.  An app to substitute your own mnemonic is in the works.    Request a Heisig variant of any of my kanji pages via info AT aule-browser.com - it only takes a few minutes to generate a variant using Curl from Tokyo's SCSK Corp.    A great e-book variant of the Henshall might show etymology and/or stroke order and combine the best of both of those editions ( I have since added some exploratory pages at (...) - with some pages linked to wiktionary andsome to stokre-order gif's; several focus on learning Kanji thru Haiku and many offer a \\"Kanji of the Day\\" as the default in their Search field )
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I remember reading this book when it first came out. I love how defined the characters are and the coming of age story truly shines in this book. Pennywise is the ultimate monster and even with the odd ending, the book is still a true classic.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This is a wonderful musical to own and in HD to boot. The singing is tremendous as mentioned in several other reviews. However, as everyone is entitled to their opinion, I am also very fond of the Phantom movie from 2004. I think Emmy Rossum had a beautiful voice and played a sweet and innocent Christine in the film and Gerard Butler might not be Michael Crawford when it comes to the voice, but he played a dark and menacing phantom who hit the nail on the head in the various dramatic scenes he was required to play. I think there is room for both the film and the newly released HD Blu-ray. The camera angles caught this play so well and the lighting is so good. The end was icing on the cake, with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman joining Andrew Lloyd Webber on stage. If you are wondering if you should buy this, take the plunge. You will be glad you did.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is great game. I enjoy the challenge of earning more games.  would highly recommend this to anyone who needs an enjoyable time waster.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love the ability to access and support all of my computers while on the go.  Works great for remote controlling my home media machine as well.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|Amazing radio app, any music you could want, so many stations, constantly updating, great interface and the new ICS update is fantastic!
B006UG90RM|4.0|I am stunned.  I really did not expect this record to be this good.  Like most VH fans, I thought they had nothing left in the tank.  Certainly the Sammy Hagar years did nothing to dissuade me of that notion.  I bought \\"5150,\\" hated it and never touched another Van Halen record until this one.  For Van Halen to really work, it has to have the two things Sammy Hagar does not possess:  personality and a sense of humor.  Putting a 6th grade-level pun into an album title is a sign that something is wrong.  OU812?  For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge?  That is just plain embarrassing.  At least David Lee Roth has style.  You may not like it, but he has it.  Sammy Hagar was and is as bland as an unsalted Saltine cracker.  So Roth returning to the group gave me a little hope.  This album is incredible.  A lot of people are going to slam it for being full of reworked demo tracks from before the first Van Halen album.  This is true, but if you listen to those same early demos, you would hear a LOT of bits and pieces of what would become \\"Mean Streets,\\" \\"Hang 'Em High,\\" \\"Where Have All the Good Times Gone\\" (solo bit,) \\"Hot For Teacher\\" and many many others.  So it isn't like Van Halen never cribbed from their own early material before.  On this record, Eddie Van Halen is on top of his game. Losing a third of his tongue, having a hip replaced, battling cancer and addiction...none of these things seems to have done anything but improve his playing.  It is as though getting out from under the syrupy ballad schmaltz of Sammy Hagar has lit the fire back in him.  Or maybe it is the infusion of youth, having Wolf Van Halen playing the bass.  Perhaps Wolfie has inspired his aging guitar master father to regain the fire of his own youth.  As for Wolf, his playing is solid, at times impressive.  If Eddie did not play the bass lines on the record, then I am indeed impressed with Wolf's playing.  His backing vocals have easily taken up the slack for the missing Michael Anthony as well.  Alex Van Halen is still banging the crap out of his drum kit.  He is still as energetic and frenetic as ever, providing a rock solid hard rock foundation for this band.  David Lee Roth is back in form as well.  Gone are the screams that punctuated VH songs in the past, too often, if you think about it.  He will let loose with one here and there.  But he has increased his range a bit over the years.  And he was never that much about the singing, as much as being about the showmanship and the fronting of the band.  All of that is back.  His sense of humor and playfulness is back as well.  And perhaps most important of all, there isn't a \\"Love Walks In\\" or \\"When Its Love\\" type song anywhere on this record.  Such crap was never a strong suit of Van Halen.  For Van Halen fans, TRUE Van Halen fans, the ones who were disgusted and disheartened at the malaise of the Van Hagar years, this is a welcome return to blistering hard rock and roll.  Thank God.  There is far too little of it these days.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great and very entertaing.  I would recommend it to any one because it is enjoyable and fun.
B005QJZ5FA|3.0|First of all, this is MY opinion of this album. I will not ride the bandwagon just because she is new and different, (she is new..but not that different). I have read many reviews, and it seems that if you don't like her, your opinions are worthless. Guess what. People do have different music tastes. Live with it.<br /><br />I personally do not like this album that much, but she does have potential. Read her biography before you make statements about \\"how she lived those words\\". She grew up quite well.<br /><br />It's no coincidence that Adele was THE artist of 2011, and that Del Rey seems to follow that mold. I always suspect artists that come out soon on the heels of a successful  artist, (like Jessie J and Katy Perry).<br /><br />Her lyrics aren't that bad, but the production and sound seem rather sharp and irritating. The songs just don't seem to flow well, and it can be downright depressing. It will be interesting to hear her next album, since this is an Interscope rehash of some of her earlier stuff plus new. Her Billboard results in sales show somebody likes her, so she is getting the exposure.<br /><br />But being popular doesn't mean you are great. I give it 3 stars because there is a great potential here, but would like to hear more of her then what she is showing on this album.<br /><br />Again my opinion, opinions are not facts. You may disagree, that is fine. That is your opinion.
B00192IV9U|4.0|Not a bad album at all. We can say that some of the songs are impersonators, but at the end of the day, we don't really know. Vocals can be processed to a point where the singer doesn't sound like they normally do.  The bottom line is, we should enjoy the album for what it is. A nice little collection of new recordings from \\"The King of Pop\\".  My favorites on this collection are \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" and \\"I Like The Way That You Love Me\\".  It's nice to hear Michael again and nice to know that he is starting to get the respect he has always deserved. After all, it's always been about the music.
B0036S4CTS|3.0|I quite liked the concept of revisiting one day a year over a 20 year time period. I enjoyed getting to know Dex and Em but wasn't happy with the ending. I wasn't expecting it and it left me feeling a bit flat. There didn't seem to be a reason for the way it ended.<br /><br />For me I would really get into the day, and would then be disapointed when the day ended, and I didn't find out what happened next (as it then fast forwarded to that same day 12 months later).<br /><br />It was an enjoyable read, but not 5 stars as the reviews for the movie lead me to believe!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love love love this game. all the games are very amusing and addictive.  some of them are challenging some are just fun
B004UID2LC|5.0|very good and very helpful I believe everybody should download this app it is also good for finding videos that suit you
B005R32L66|2.0|I downloaded this app hoping to use it to Skype my sister and her two kids, as Skype is usually easier for her than Gchat.  To my dismay, even on WiFi, the video calling takes FOREVER to load, rendering it mostly useless for us.  If you have a front facing camera and you want to video call over WiFi, just use the Gchat video.  This was basically useless for me.

B002RKSCA6|5.0|With my new Kindle, I loaded up on the (free) classics and I had always meant to read this book. I was surprised by two things (a) how slim and quick this book was and (b) how different it is from all the movie versions of J&H I - and probably you - grew up with. It's interesting because there's a whole other cast of characters that are never mentioned in the adaptations and what ultimately happens to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is quietly powerful and more suited for the book. I won't give away the ending but, like I said, it's not what you expect. I actually sent this to a number of friends after I read it and they all had the same reaction, which is that the book is more complex than a simple \\"good personality/bad personality\\" story we all think we know.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I do not use Dropbox often, but I have found it to be occasionally indispensible.  When job hunting, saving documents from your computer and then getting them on your phone can be a pain, but it could not be simpler with Dropbox.  I upload my resume, cover letters, writing samples, and whatever else I need, and if I see a job notification, I can apply in minutes, even if I am away from my computer.  I predominantly use this for Word files, so I have never hit the limit, but I believe it is 2 gbs.  For a free app, the functionality is great!

Anyway Just wanted to get this out their before some annoyed parent says something, Hey amazonian's (I just assume that's what you call your work force) this series is rated \\"TV-pg\\" might want to fix that before \\"mommy southern religious hick\\" complains.

B0000DJZA5|4.0|Long time Beatles fan.  I like this CD because from all of the books I've read, this was the original intention.  Yes, it is missing a couple of junk songs.  I don't miss them.  This is actually my least liked Beatles CD but now it is nice to listen to.  Someone said the the additional CD, \\"Fly on the wall\\" should be filled with banter.  Why 20 minutes when a CD can hold 80?  Bottom line, The Beatles heads were so far up their own asses at this time in their career that no one wants to listen to the divas.  I'm sure McCartney and Starr cringe when then hear themselves.  Better left with 60 minutes of emptiness...

030788743X|3.0|A light, fun romp through a well-imagined, if largely plagiarised, near-future universe. It's hard not to enjoy these sort of monomyth hero-quest stories. I started out hating the book but by then end I was eager to find out what happened next. A page-turner for sure.  That said, it has some serious issues. I didn't find the constant 80s references as annoying as some reviewers as that's the central conceit of the book, so what do you expect? But the prose is of really poor quality. As other reviewers have pointed out, it's barely even young-adult level. Usually very simple description of the \\"I went here and did this, then I went there and did that\\" variety. Mountains of cliche. And if you want a good drinking game, try having one every time Cline has the first person narrator append the adverb \\"quickly\\" to some action he's carrying out. You'll be blackout drunk by about Chapter 4.  There's also reams of naked exposition. Apparently the admonition \\"Show, don't tell\\" is something Cline has never heard. I listened to the audiobook version and the first two hours or more was virtually all pure information, as if recited from an encyclopedia. I felt like I was being read a summary of the book, rather than the book itself.  The main character is a bit of a Mary Sue and the supporting characters are all off the shelf archetypes, but it doesn't really matter in a story of this type, although the dialogue is painfully bad in places. It's all about the plot, which is engaging and paced well.  This was a piece of fluff book along the lines of The Da Vinci Code, but for nerds. It has the potential to be a good movie, where Cline will be forced to show and not tell and the bad prose won't matter. They'll probably need a script doctor to fix the dialogue though.  If you want to read a book along these lines with better writing and more interesting ideas, I recommend Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash. Despite the latter's pacing and structure issues, it is a much better book than this. Hopefully the movie will live up to its potential.
0374275637|4.0|This book took me a very very long time to get through.  Not because it was bad, but because there was A LOT of information.  And the plethora of information actually did not bore me.  The book talks about System 1 vs System 2 (two different systems of thinking and reacting), Econ vs Humans, and the Experiencing vs Remembering Self.  There are lots of interactive questions and exercises for the reader to prove the author's points.  The statements at the end of each chapter helped in reviewing what you just read.  Excellent read overall!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I installed this CPU fan on a i7-2600k processor, and it keeps it ice cold!  I used a Corsair Carbide 500R case and an ASUS p8z68-v Pro/gen3 motherboard, and it fit perfectly.  Pros:    * The mounting bracket is very sturdy metal, it doesn't use the cheap plastic clips that the stock cooler came with.    * It keeps the CPU very cool    * It is very customizable in terms of fan placement (push vs. pull, direction of airflow, etc.)  Cons:    * This thing is HUGE!  Make sure your case has plenty of room to accommodate it.  Also make sure there is enough room between your RAM banks and the fan.  On my p8z68, it just barely fits.  Notes:    * Make sure when you're mounting the base through the motherboard to the back plate, that you pay attention to the fact that the thumbscrews have a flat side on them.  You'll drive yourself nuts trying to get them to fit if you don't see that detail.    * It would have been nice to have a bit more guidance on the amount of thermal paste to use.  Since the heat transfer plate isn't flat, you need a bit more to get up into the grooves, but there's no real way to know how much more.
B000VDUWMC|3.0|Numerous reviews discuss the content of the book at length. I'd rather focus on the book itself. I've had the opportunity to read both the paperback and Kindle versions of this book, and this review is specifically for the Kindle version. My issues with Guns, Germs and Steel are two-fold: first, the book is huge. There is a LOT of content to cover, some of which is repetitive, and Mr. Diamond *loves* his case studies. While very thorough, at times I feel a bit like I'm being hammered on with example after example supporting his thesis. A good 20% of this book could have been eliminated and still have been just as substantial.<br />Secondly, and the main reason for a 3-star review instead of 4, is specifically dealing with the Kindle version's layout: while there are repeated references to tables and maps, they do not appear in the Kindle version. They really made a difference in making some of what Mr. Diamond references, clear, in the paperback, but with them gone in the Kindle, it rapidly becomes confusing and uninteresting. Footnotes, especially linked footnotes, would have gone a LONG way in promoting the readability of the book, and made the girth much more bearable.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|Let me just say that I'm a huge fan of the original Hangover, I rarely laugh at movies, but I was lughing my ass off at it.  The Hangover 2 on the other hand...I really didn't find anything to laugh at, it just felt like an unfunny rehash of the last film, which it is.
B006UG909U|5.0|I was blown away by this release.With Roth back in the ranks they are now complete.Best VH release since 1984.I actually like TATTOO,but is not the best song on here.I really like STAY FROSTY(reminds me of ICE CREAM MAN a little).Roth's vocals are as strong as ever and Eddie is way above par in his playing.AMAZING!Wolfgang is good too as well as ALEX rips it as usual.Overall it's one hell of a comeback for VH.I noticed a few negative reviews and must not be diehard fans.If you love VH this should not be overlooked.I just hope they continue to record w/ Roth.Maybe the next cd won't take over 10 years to come out,but this one was well worth the wait!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is so cool,I a falling in love with it.  cant be with out it.  I needed it everyday. everyone should have and use this
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome cool so I would give it five stars you have to admit it is awesome thanks for making it free
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is colorful and user friendly.  Lots of fun to play. Challenging and addictive. Other Mahjong games don't give the challenge of finding and exposing the gold tiles.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Very impressed with the location resolution and functionality of the device. Training data automatically transfers to the computer upon entering the room and uploads to internet.  Instructions about setup weren't so clear, however, so that took a little time to figure out.  I like this watch very much as do my running friends to whom I've shown the cool data tracking capabilities.

0439023521|3.0|On the surface, `The Hunger Games' is an intense read, diving headfirst into a possible future where a tyrant government controls a country's food supply/wealth/and even lives.  There once was 13 separate districts.  You can not leave your designated district.  If you do, you will either face a horrid future, you have to watch 24-hours worth of Twilight - or worse - death  - though I suspect watching Twilight for 24-hours straight is equal to death!  One district ended up rebelling, and well - there's now 12 districts.  Because the tyrant government wants to prove that they are the worst government since the W. Bush days, they decide to create a gruesome televised game called `The Hunger Games' - two kids, 12 to 16 years old from each district, is drafted into this game.  The story is narrated by a young teen that volunteer after hearing her younger sister drafted.  From there on, the story, told by her, shifts to the preparation of the game, and finally, the game itself.  A bunch of kids are placed in a jungle-type-area where they have to hunt for themselves, feed for themselves, and kill each other until there is one declared winner.  And the game has many twists and turns, enticing both the viewer of the games being aired in the story, and the reader.  For a young adult book, it's quite intense (though the death scenes are obviously toned down a bit).  I can understand some of its appeal.  And I can sense as I was reading the book, the subtle references to where the author proclaimed she got inspired to write this story: the Iraq war (which had been televised heavily), and the reality TV fad, which plagues every single TV station and network.  It does make you question the unnecessary shock-value reality TV does, and its superficial viewers that continue to thrive on the reality TV hell.  Will it ever come to this: watching young kid's murder each other for the good of entertainment?  I mean, we already have a show about teeny-boppers being knocked up on MTV.  What's next?  It's good to know, though, that networks do have some limits.  NBC just recently pulled a Fear Factor episode where one lady drinks a large glass of donkey urine, and another lady drinks a large glass of donkey semen.  America, the proud?  For anyone that's under the age of 20, this book will probably appeal to you.  It's very well written, presented nicely, and almost makes you believe this book is a real memoir.  But for someone (like me) that is quite familiar with the sci-fi genre, there isn't one single moment in this book that is original.  Predictable and even a bit cliché (especially the love triangle - UGH!), I expected more with all the hype.  Even those shock-and-awe moments through out the `game' were predictable.  The broadcasting of death on TV for entertainment value has been, dare I say, done to death.  With that said, I think of this book as what it should be - a nicely told homage to the sci-fi genre.  Suzanne Collins did not reinvent the genre, and it certainly doesn't add anything new.  But for what it is worth, it kept me entertained.  I can understand the appeal under-20 age group.  I don't understand the hype over 20.  Come on people - read Stephen King's `The Bachman Books!'  I am interested in the movie, but I am not interested in the remaining `trilogy.'  I pretty much know where it is going...which saddens me because I really wanted to read something imaginative, instead of recycled.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like having the ability to synchronize my Kindle content between all platforms -- PC, Kindle Reader, Android Phone, Android Tablet.  The app on the tablet is actually, in my opinion, nicer that the original Kindle hardware reader.  And, having the ability to reference material from my cell when needed (although not ideal for regular reading) is very helpful.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game. Its great for boring days!! I find myself losing track of time whenever I play it and I get so caught up in trying to beat the games.
B004V5QWU2|4.0|My wife has gotten used to having sound such as rolling ocean tides playing during the night to drown out other background sounds, etc.  This app provides several sounds that can be downloaded (no extra cost) and programmed to play for any desired duration.  It's handy to have this on the cell phone for use when traveling.  Very nice.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game offers hours of entertainment. these mini games remind me of nintendo's Mario party. simple, but also fun. love it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i have thoroughly enjoyed playing these games.  it's easy to earn the extra points to unlock the next level of games. great app.

141694737X|5.0|Dear Zoo we love you ;)<br /><br />This was Marylou's first lit the flap book (at age 17 months old) so i really didn't know what she would think or if she was even ready for it. The first reading through Marylou seemed bored but after a seeing the dog at the end of the book it had her attention, an instant hit with her. She will bring me the book and i'll tell her the animals, what they say and sort of act some out to interact with her as much as possible. she will repeat some sounds (the elephant & dog) that she already knew making it fun for both of us. One i act out is the frog i would ribbit and sort of jump (small jump while sitting) which would make her laugh. recently we took it along to a friends house and she brought me the book, i didn't act out the animals or make the sounds but when i got to frog Marylou started jumping in place just like momma. I just loved it and knew it was a great purchase after all. Paul pointed out that he's seen her \\"reading\\" the book by herself, she flips the pages and lifts the flaps and even gives kisses to some of the animals. Also when she does read with momma i let her lift the flaps to reveal the animal, this way seems to hold her attention.<br /><br />I know some reviews mentioned the story line and being pretty against it. I see where they are coming from but for now Marylou loves her animals and if it comes up i will try to use it to show her that is not how to treat a pet or person. there is no sending back in our home no matter how jumpy (like a frog) she is. i hope she always knows we love her and this wont confuse her about that.
B004UID2LC|5.0|i have a kindle fire and it works fine with this app. i love this app it is really good
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I love lyrics, always have. I usually don't listen to music that I cannot figure out the words to. Just never connects with me. Instrumentals are still fine but music that connects for the most part needs lyrics.  And such wonderful lyrics these are. There are about seven different persona's on the album, maybe more. They range from silly child-like voices with amazing depth and a tragic past/present/future. Then the torch singer, lost souls, divas and bad girls. What wonderful bad girls.  Gramma Says isn't on the album. A slight disappointment but this will not leave you wanting. She has more depth and some of the tracks are from the YouTube songs. The new ones are very good.  I suppose if you are a music critic or a purist then this might not be the album for you. If you have liked ANY of her YouTube work then you will like most, if not all of this impressive work. Plus the price is just too good to pass up. I got the MP3 and will pick the CD as well. It is hard to complain when so many companies charge that much for just a CD.  Long Live Lana Del Rey
0307957934|5.0|I have not liked all of harris' works, although he always writes beautifully. But I have read this one in nearly one shot. I simply could not put it down. The theme is extremely relevant and intelligently treated. The suspense is unbearable: you just want to read on. Harris' research on the financial industry is top-notch and exposes many of the real problems it causes today. Financial and corporate thrillers used to be the genre in vogue ten years ago. With \\"the fear index\\", they are back in full glory. IMO, a masterpiece!
B006UG90RM|5.0|I am a Van Halen fan from the beginning and like both DLR and Sammy. I liked some of Sammy's stuff better than DLR. For example, I like For Unlawful more than Diver Down and 1984.  A Different Kind of Truth kicks ass. It is their best album since Fair Warning. One of the reasons is Wolfgang blows Michael Anthony away as a bass player. \\"Tattoo\\" is good and the album just gets better and better from their.  Van Halen proved me and a lot of people wrong. I don't care if some of the songs are from old demos, they are all VH songs written by VH. No watered down help from other writers (Aerosmith anyone?). Just pure kick ass songs.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|They really had the opportunity to do something creative with this tale. Instead they catered to the Twilight crowd...and not very well at that. The acting, aside from Gary Oldman's contribution, was seriously difficult to endure. The background music sounded cheaply edited and just cheap in general. The wolves could have been amazing but instead were only semi-interesting, staying pretty much shrouded in darkness throughout,  which hinted to me that shortcuts were being taken in their overall construction. I had high hopes for this movie but it turned out to be a sloggy endurance test with no reward.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is perfect for anyone with iffy wifi signal. When ur in a wifi signal, just simply search ur favorite youtube videos and download them straight to ur kindle! PERFECT if u want free songs... Or want to watch ur favorite youtube classics on the go! :) Definitely FIVE STAR APP! Download or Die&lt;3
B006UG90RM|5.0|Quite simply thee album of the month, year & decade!!!! Best tunes right now for me are- \\"Bullethead\\", \\"China Town\\",  \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll\\" & \\"Blood & fire\\" w/ \\"Big River trailing close behind. Amazing would be an understatement. This is a band firing on all cylinders! Perfection in a jewel case!!
B0066W1AZK|1.0|like many others, I thought that this game was fun........... until I got towards the end of the game. it would not let me move my peices to an advantage place, so I had absolutely no chances of winning!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I purchased this watch after doing a lot of research, and I'm very happy with it. The GPS connects quickly, the HRM connects to the watch without any problems, and the features are everything I could want. I have had some trouble with the wireless ANT, but after a reinstall it seems to be working better.

I have seen kids write better short stories.  DO NOT BUY !!
B005D0RDIE|5.0|My son (4) and I watch this video at least once a week.  It is a great show, has cool extras and the usual animated stuff that continues to show this great band has a fantastic sense of humor.  What a great bunch of guys.  For anyone who appreciates RUSH this is a must have.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Not exactly but close enough.  Just need a track ball for my DROID Bionic.  Got it for free but I think I would be happy if I had paid for it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I didn't want to spend a lot on a case for my fire but wanted to keep it safe. Its pretty nice, it can fold and act like a stand, overall for the price I'm very pleased.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I absolutely love this app. On my Kindle fire, and installed on 3 of my computers, I never go without any document or image I need. Additionally, I use this app to check on my pets from a remote location. I just open up the remote computer camera from the Kindle, and watch what kind of trouble the dogs are getting into. I highly recommend it.
B003UESJHO|5.0|If you come from a tough background, this movie will deeply move you emotionally...it's done well...the acting is great and although fightter movies abound, this one stands out.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This VH cd is solid and will rock your blues away! Eddie plays some of the most aggressive guitar since Fair Warning. Wolfie does a good job at bass. At the beginning of \\"She's The Woman\\" you can hear him keep up with Eddie lick for lick.!  DLR has lost some of his voice range, but it's ok.  I mean is not like DLR sang like Freddie Mercury, Robert Plant, or Brad Delp(RIP bro) for that matter.  I really do like this cd. It's listening pleasure for sure!  The more I heard it the more I like it!  Pay no attention for those who gave it a review of 3 stars or less.  Consider this 44 out of 233 reviews gave \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" 3 stars or less. That's only 18.8% That's the MINORITY!!.  On the other hand 149 reviews had 5 stars, or 63.9%.  Get it?  This is a killer cd, and most people liked it and are buying it.  I went to a Walmart 2 days ago and it was totally sold out!  Went to Fry's and found only 3 copies left!  If you are thinking of buying \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\", go for it!. Buy it!  either here, or where ever!  One last thing regarding Eddie. Is really amazing what a motivated guitar player and his guitar can do!

0307959856|4.0|Taking place six years after Elizabeth and Darcy are married, Death Comes to Pemberley is a tale of 'murder and emotional mayhem'.<br /><br />On the eve of the Lady Anne's Ball (named after Darcy's late mother), a coach comes hurtling towards the doors of the magnificent and stately home of Pemberley. Practically falling from the carriage is a distraught and inconsolable Lydia screaming that her beloved Wickham has been murdered.<br /><br />Darcy, Colonel Fitzwilliam and a young solicitor Alveston embark on a hurried journey to the woodlands where they believe they will find a body. However, upon arrival they find Wickham alive, but lamenting over a bloody corpse, namely that of Captain Denny, Wickham's long term friend. From this point onward, Darcy, Elizabeth and their household are caught up in scandal and intrigue. As the trial starts, it seems clear-cut but a final piece of evidence brings to light further questions.<br /><br />Will the sacred halls of Darcy's beloved home, his wife and children ever be free from Wickham and his dubious character?<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of PD James and have always admired her skill of creating a brilliant mystery. So, I'm feeling a little guilty of not loving this particular story as much as her Dalgleish novels. It is brilliantly written, but felt that retelling of the original story (in parts) was a little unwarranted. I think anyone wishing to read this would know the story - at least I hope so.<br /><br />The plot is uncomplicated; the twist and the marrying up of seemingly random people and their tales are wrapped up in true James' style. I've read that some people think that Elizabeth is no longer the vibrant character that we meet in Pride & Prejudice. I don't completely agree with this; Elizabeth has a great respect for the staff of Pemberley especially Mrs. Reynolds. At the time of taking direction from the housekeeper, Elizabeth was in a state of shock. Also, let's not forget that Lizzy has been married for several years and over that time her once boisterous outlook would have changed as her and Darcy took on each other's traits - Darcy has always respected his staff, why would Elizabeth not do the same?<br /><br />Overall, this is a good read. Although written superbly, don't expect a classic James thriller. I think she has paid homage to Austen in a very respectable way with a befitting 'sequel' that fans of both authors will not necessarily love, but certainly enjoy.ook would have changed as her and Darcy took on each other's traits - Darcy has always respected his staff, why would Elizabeth not do the same?

B002BU0DPE|5.0|This headset had received mixed reviews on most sites but don't be fooled; This is the best valued headset on the market.  For $60 you won't be able to find a better pair of headphone on the market, gaming or not. The bass is excellent and while gaming sounds can be located easily without the stereo enhancer. Watch your favorite movie with these and get a new perspective on the sounds.  Don't listen to those who say it will break within a few months. I've had my pair since June of 09' and they are going strong today. Guess what, if you throw this on the floor when you're done using it, or drop it repeatedly, it will break, just like any electronic device. It takes the same amount of care as your cell phone or ipod to keep it in good shape.  The voice quality on both ends is excellent on PS3 and PC. Just like the other reviews say, when the game sound increases your chat volume increases on the same scale so you won't have to be constantly adjusting the two.  Dislikes  I have two dislikes with this headset. First, after gaming for around 3 hours consecutively, your ears will start to get hot. Just take off the headset for a minute to cool down and let everything air out. Not a huge Issue  Secondly the clip that allows you to attach to volume controller to your pocket will most likely break after prolonged use. Also not a big issue because you can just lay the wire on top of your legs.  To sum this up, if you are a gamer and want a high quality headset to enhance the experience GET THIS HEADSET. You will not be disappointed because this is the best value on the market
B006UG90RM|5.0|I am very happy that the band is back with a new album. I own all Van Halen Albums up until OU812. This album is has a great list of songs, variety and Dave is back. A lot of negative things have been said about Dave, Sammy, Mike, Wolfgang and Ed lately. I appreciate all members of Van Halen (Past and Present).<br /><br />Times have changed though and Dave is back, it's not 1984 anymore but the songs are well done. Yes, some off the riffs are from the Van Halen Demo days. However, this is not a short 30 minute record like some of their past albums. Dave is getting older, but brings his wide ranging talents to the songs. Eddie, is playing like he's in his 20's and Alex and Wolfgang bring it too.<br /><br />I like almost all of the songs on the album. I am glad I purchased it, because there seems to be no one rocking anymore. Van Halen put out a great album, and it's time for the haters to move on. This is not a Sammy vs. Dave issue, the music is Van Halen. Check out As is, You and your blues, Big river...and if you don't like it don't buy it.<br /><br />The people complaining probably listen to Justin Bieber. They should learn to keep their mouths shut!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wow, this app beats the Amazon Kindle Bible I bought. You can quickly navigate to book, chapter and verse. It include many different translations and works great on my Zoom tablet running ICS.

0545259088|4.0|*This review is for ALL THREE book in this series.*  Age Group: solid YA (implied/described sexual content; graphic violence)  Rating: Idea 4; Execution 4; Style 4.5  Genre: romantic fantasy  Shiver / Linger  Grace is relatively happy living in her rural home with parents who are rarely ever there...it's lonely, but she creates her own structure: good grades, no late nights...  Only when she begins to feel drawn away from the warmth and light into the quick chill of the Boundary Wood that fringes her house--toward the pack of wolves that roams there--does she realize that something is missing, and perhaps always has been.  Then the boy appears--and he is one of them, she is sure. His yellow eyes belong to the wolf, the stormy gray wolf who saved her all those years ago.  And then, he is Sam. And she cannot imagine life without him. So she doesn't...  ...but the cold, and his earthy, shaggy, winter body remembers. It will claim him.  It might be calling her, too.  Forever  Sam is stable...as much as he can be without Grace.  Where she is...what she is, he can't be sure. He only knows he needs to find her, fast.  Now that a second death has been blamed on his pack, they only have so much time before the hunters begin closing in. It may already be too late.  ____________________________________________________________  This series is sort of in a class by itself. It is a dark, brooding romantic fantasy of a similar brand as that of Twilight, but the style (and LACK of love triangle) is superior enough to make that comparison invalid. And, I think the quality of the writing has only improved with age. Out now, the third book has all of the same qualities as Shiver and Linger, only more crystallized and focused.  For one, the world is built with integrity. Fitting to the plot, it is tight and limited, but the text makes it visceral. Metaphor is a key descriptive player and it is used in fresh and surprising ways. Sam's favorite poet Maria Rainer Rilke is quoted often,and I daresay the text benefits immensely from that--in style as much as in content.  The characters are multi-dimensional, but focused and consistent. They grown and learn--about themselves and others--over the course of the trilogy. (You would think that would be a given, but I've learned the hard way that this is an unusual characteristic in YA lit these days! So, when I see it, I like to point it out.) The side characters are intriguing (bad-boy Cole is there for those of us who like a scruffy egomaniac) and take on a life of their own as they become more central to the storyline in Forever. This is in part due to the multiple-point-of-view format of the book, which I found refreshing (each chapter is written in a different character's voice). Overall, they (Sam, Grace, Cole, Isabel, etc) aren't extremely deep, and sometimes their realizations are slightly obvious, but it's not to the point of annoying. The crux of the book really is the plight of the werewolf, and, of course, the two soul mates caught in the crossfire between an errant biology and an ignorant humanity.  Yes, it's a tender, emo love story. However, even though soft, skinny, sensitive Sam is not really my type, he is such a well-drawn character, you can't help but like him. The poetry--Rilke's, not necessarily Sam's--often would step in to redeem him for me, giving him a deeper facet than most other series' boy toys have. He so clearly needs Grace that you can't help but root for them. Grace herself is all but perfect, but not in an unlikable way. She's beautiful, but strong (kind of like Bella Swan should have been).  Really, for all of the wolf in them, they are both very human.  The plot is fairly strong: catching and medium-paced. I got slightly impatient at times, so it wouldn't have worked for me to read all 3 books in a row. I read them as they came out, and I was actually happy with that. The world is compelling enough to make revisiting a pleasure. Some reviewers did not like the endingof the trilogy, but I did. True, it's ambivalent, but not in a cheap, incongruent, copout, \\"no questions answered\\" way like the Incarceron series. There's the hint of what could happen, but not the confirmation. Frankly, it totally fits with the style, and I was ok with that.  In fact, the most striking characteristic of the books for me lies in the style--in the \\"feeling\\" the writing gives: of cold.  True, the story is purposefully set on the borders of a wilderness in Mercy Falls, Minnesota, where winters are long and harsh: cold is what makes a werewolf shift into a wolf. But it's one thing to simply state that fact--another to weave it into the fabric of the text. I don't quite know how to explain what I mean, but for all the warmth of Sam and Grace's relationship, I always came away from the text with a chill. It was as if there was somehow something delicate lying between me and them, a subtle frosty whisper that fills and parts the air.  That, I found totally masterful.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|This case is amazing! First of all, the outside cover is a beautiful rustic red with all the different cities of the world in very classy cursive. It feels light but also very durable. I've read numerous complaints about the elastics. They are wonderful!!! If its hard at first to get the fire under the elastics,take two fingers and gently stretch them around each corner. Once stretched around the corners, the fire fits securely and perfectly. These are good quality elastics. It closes just like a book and stays closed! This is a great case!
0312641893|4.0|Age Group: YA (totally clean)  Genre: Scifi + Post-Apocalyptic  Rating Breakdown: Idea 5+; Execution 3+  Cinder is a cyborg--which in her society means barely human. Somewhere in a past she can't remember, there was an accident that left her parentless and a surgery that gave her a foot and a hand she doesn't want, but can't live without. Her one glimmer of hope came in the form of a scientist from the Eastern commonwealth--a conglomerate of countries united by the emperor sometime after the devastating WW4--but was dashed before she even know about him, when he died of the Letumosis epidemic.  Now, stuck with a stepmother who hates her, working as a mechanic to pay bills that aren't her own, in a country swept by plague and threatened by war from the psychotic Lunar queen, Cinder only dreams of escape.  And, then the Prince walks in.  __________________________________________________________________________________________________  First off, you must read this book. It's great. You'll enjoy it, I guarantee. It's overall tightly written, fast paced, and unique. I was drawn to the cover at first sight and couldn't put it down!  But, as a connoisseur (hah!) I am truly on the fence about it. As a reviewer, I feel compelled to tell the whole truth and nothing but. So, while on the one hand it was a thrilling read, it has its flaws.  I love the concept--very original. Instead of a technologically backwards future of the sort we're used to seeing in today's post-apocalyptic or dystopian novels, this one is very techno-savvy. Reminded me of Westerfeld's The Uglies in its tenor. Hover cars are all the rage, and human beings survive historically fatal or utterly disfiguring injuries because of extreme advances in surgical prosthetics.  Fairly logically-advanced versions of the internet, computers, and televisions are the main form of communication and entertainment, which helps tie nicely into the present-day world.  The commonwealth, and its emperor are situated in Asia, in a city called New Beijing, making this the second book to allude to fears of China's rise to world power. However, unlike some, this book doesn't see that as a bad thing. The Emperor and his family are just, fair rulers, and peacefully cohabitate with other ruling bodies--except those on the moon (yup!).  Instead of climate change, and/or oil shortage being the cause of the apocalypse (both of which have been almost overdone these days...), it's international conflict that spawned both destruction and peace between Earthen countries. Unchecked greed and power hunger is the reason for the latest threat from the mutated inhabitants of the moon--and their mind-controlling queen.  Up until that point, everything was great. But, the mind control was where the book started to get under my skin. I found it to be too convenient, cheesy, inconsistently implemented, and ineffective.  Similarly, though I appreciated the attempt to align this with the original Cinderella story, a few of the plot elements at the end were too forced. This is a problem I have with a lot of fairytale re-imaginings: they don't seem to realize you can pick and choose which elements to include--and even then, you can bend them a little to fit your setting. This book tried too hard to get them all in...and didn't bend or wield them skillfully enough to fit. For one, the \\"carriage\\" (an old rusted out automobile) was a potentially really intriguing twist that just didn't deliver and faded out as abruptly as it appeared. More importantly, however, the ball was just totally out of place, in my mind. Not only was it a virtual impossibility (all the citizens of one major city invited at once?), but then, why such an outdated ritual in full 17th century style was the one tradition that held over from the old to such a futuristic world wasn't explained. It wasn't the right scene for the confrontation, and as a result, the final scenes were just not cathartic enough.  As for characters, the evil queen wasn't very believable--her dialogue made me chuckle at some points. And, last but not least, Cinder just wasn't a decisive or confident enough character for my taste. Why she waited so long to work on the Prince's robot--meanwhile the dropped hints and reminders of its import were abundant--I just couldn't figure out. And her two obsessions--her own imperfection and escape--were overdone to the point of threatening the story not only plot-wise, but overall by making her slightly annoying.  That said, however, I really enjoyed the concept and the world, and will definitely be looking out for book 2--which I hope will benefit from its freedom from the original story and license to do fantastic things with a fantastic concept.

B002XTXG1G|5.0|This could be called a bio-pic, but it doesn't tell us a life story in a traditional way. The film is directed by the man who gave us the outstanding gangster movie Drive recently, a Dane with a name like a typo: Refn.<br /><br />The life that we learn about is that of a man who has spent 30 years in solitary confinement. The final screen of the movie, which was produced in 2008, tells us that he is still there.<br />Before you build up any sympathy or pity for the poor victim, have a look at this man, Michael Peterson, Britain's most violent prisoner. In the course of his career he raises the moniker to Britain's most expensive prisoner.<br />He is a violent monster with a total lack of normal social behavior. Initially jailed for a post office robbery, he develops a liking for the prison cell, his 'hotel'. He fights with his jailers whenever he can. He is moved to the 'funny house', where he tries to kill a pedophile. In his next institution he gets to start a large scale riot. Released from prison, he starts a new career as a bare-knuckle fighter and changes his name to Charles Bronson. He is incarcerated again after a jewelry store robbery, 69 days after his release.<br /><br />But, as I said, this is not a normal biopic. We are not obliged to believe everything. It is not told like a normal story. It is probably not the full story anyway.<br />Bronson tells us his story himself, or rather, actor Tom Hardy does. He does it, partly, on a stage, with an audience, acting with masks and with pantomime scenes, some quite brilliant. He does it partly sitting in a cell or a cage, often beaten up and bloody, always proud to be a hellhound.The tale is sometimes funny and then tends to dive into nauseating depths of black or yukki humor.<br /><br />The whole arrangement is a bit like a piece of Brechtian theater. Verfremdung is used advantageously and entertainingly. Macky Messer was a choir boy against Bronson.<br />Many of the most brutal scenes are enhanced by operatic music. I am not expert enough in this genre, and I haven't figured out the musical score, but I assume that it uses a lot of Wagner. The music combines opera with techno. It might even be worth watching the film again and pay more attention to identifying the music.and I haven't figured out the musical score, but I assume that it uses a lot of Wagner.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|Charles Dickens' classic is one of the best books ever - I read it once a year near the Christmas season.  But when they started making it into movies they started to screw it up.  Some of the movies were great, some were awful to the point where they make me when to kick Tiny Tim.  It was if something was missing.<br />When I saw this movie on the big screen, with my Dad, when it first came out I realized what was missing.<br />Charles Dickens voice!  That third person voice of the writer that fills in the details and tells us what we need to know about the history, background, and characters.  His voice sets the mood and helps keep the story moving.  Good thing for us Gonzo was there to stand in for Dickens.  No, really, it makes it one of the best movies to ever follow the story - Gonzo as Dickens really helps keep the setting and mood of the original.<br />Also, Kermit, Miss Piggy, and Michael Caine REALLY help bring it all together.  And, yes, Michael Caine sings.  This IS a musical!<br />Of course, you should also read the original story, so I suggest getting [[ASIN:1456407872 A Christmas Carol]] to read on those cold, winter nights.

B006UG90RM|1.0|I coulden't wait for this cd to be released. but when i listened to the songs on  YouTube I realized that the songs were all made in the same sweat shop.  DLR is so monotonous in this album it sickens me.  There Is Only One TRUTH: THIS ALBUM SUCKS!
0634022296|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he really loves the book. We have bought several Beatles song books that just do NOT sound right when you play them as written - this one seems to be the best at getting the right notes on all the songs - and there are a lot of songs in this book that you don't find in some other Beatles song books. Very thorough, great price. By the way - the pages are not as large as some typical song books - not an issue for us, but it is a smaller and thicker book than you might expect for a song book.
B0009RQRII|4.0|Overkill in 1993 released this oddity when comparing their body of work in 2012.  I really like the album, but it is similar to Slayer's South of Heaven - a change in direction for one album.  I do like the nod they chose in slowing things down, and making it a sabbathy, catchy, and riff-oriented album (although I wish the sound was a little thicker in spots).  It also showcased Blitz's singing.  Mind you, these guys have never released a RISK or LOAD offering.  I hope The Electric Age is as memorable as Ironbound.  Keep it going, guys!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Even as one of the bands biggest fans I had my doubts.  When I bought this CD and played it, my face had melted off before I made it home.  It was hard to believe that they had returned to their top hard rockin' form.  EVH is on fire on this one.  Chickenfoot sounds slow and thin compared to this band.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I did a quick review the second I heard the whole album (which I thought was amazing). Now, after reading everyone's reviews and listening to the record about 30 times through, I wanted to write a more educated review and respond to a few strange rumors that seem to have taken hold of the reviewer-base, here, on Amazon and elsewhere.  1. LET'S TALK ABOUT DEMOS VS. NEW MATERIAL  First off, this album is aggressive and hearkens back to everything we all loved about VH in the 70's and 80's. At some point, it was noticed that there is some re-hash of early Warner Brothers Demos and lost/under-heard tracks. That statement somehow morphed into \\"All these tunes are old demos.\\" THIS IS NOT TRUE. Over the weekend, I listened to all the old demos and lost tracks and B-sides (about 50 of them or so) and only about a third of this record is culled from old stuff. The rest is brand-spankin' new. Also, the songs that are from old material are so heavily re-worked that they're almost unrecognizable from their original versions from the 70's. Those original demos are so raw and unrefined that they are almost a joke to listen to at times. Now, those tracks that they did go back to are crisp and fun and gritty and nicely finished. They are now cohesive and ballsy and they KILL. I am a musician who knows a lot of musicians. EVERYBODY goes back to the well for every album. Whether or not they lie about it is another story. This is how it is. Van Halen is no different. Why not go back to the great leftovers? Why waste them? They are good tunes.  It should be noted that Van Halen has always culled material from the old demo days when Eddie was a riff machine. All the way through the Sammy Hagar years (Van Hagar as fans like to call it) they were doing this. As a matter of fact, the first three David Lee Roth albums (and even some of the fourth) almost come entirely from these 1975/1976 demos (read Sammy's Autobiography for more on this fact). Also, the fans have clamored to have studio recordings of these unreleased tracks for years. Now that we finally get what we've been asking for, we're going to criticize it? C'mon, guys... let's not be hypocritical. This is what we asked for. This is what we got and IT ROCKS... HARD!!!  Here's a short breakdown of which songs come from where: \\"Big River\\" is taken from a demo called \\"Big Trouble.\\" \\"Beats Workin'\\" is taken from a demo called \\"Put Out the Lights.\\" \\"Blood and Fire's\\" instrumental bits are taken from a soundtrack song from the film \\"The Wild Life.\\" The track is called \\"Donut City.\\" The major riff from \\"Outta Space\\" is taken from a demo called \\"Let's get Rockin'.\\" \\"Riffs from \\"Bullethead\\" seem familiar from those demos as do a few of the solo riffs throughout the new record, but nothing specific and \\"She's the Woman\\" is almost a direct demo from the original of the same name. That's pretty much it. Really.  2. LET'S TALK ABOUT DAVE'S VOICE  Some of the negative reviews of David Lee Roth's vocals on this record astound me. They say he sounds old and just doesn't have it anymore. Guess what, guys? HE IS OLD! He's old and he still sounds just as good as he did around the time of \\"SKYSCRAPER.\\" As a matter of fact, he could never REALLY sing and we all loved him for it. It was his energy and fun-loving lyrics that we dug. All of that is right here on this album. By the time \\"1984\\" rolled in, he was already straining a bit on the highs and doing the deep-voiced rap thing (see \\"Panama\\"). We didn't seem to care then. When \\"Crazy from the Heat\\" and \\"Eat Em and Smile\\" came around, this became part of his singing style. We all bought those records, too.  All that said, does DLR sound like he did in 1977? No, of course not... and neither do you or I. He still gives us that energy and fun old-school feel that we love.  3. THE PRODUCTION/SOUND  All of the producers and engineers involved in this record clearly had a notion of what Van Halen should sound like. There is a raw/live quality to these tracks which notonly makes them sound gritty, fun and excellent, but also makes them sit nicely alongside the original 6 records. There is a bit of a \\"wall of sound\\" thing happening here and there which can sound a touch muddy, but it also creates an awesome energy that almost makes one feel as though they are experiencing the songs in a live performance. Personally, I dig it.  4. OVERALL  I am honestly astounded with how great this album is, overall. I just expected a fun album that I would probably have to make excuses for to myself and convince myself that I liked, but... Wow No excuses needed. The fun is here, the drive and meat are here, the singable qualities are here, the raw grit is here... This is rock.  Dave... You say thanks for the dream in the liner notes. No, man... Thank YOU for the dream. You made me feel like a kid again. A feat not to be underestimated.  Well done VH

0439023521|4.0|I liked it, quite possible because I've heard it's the \\"next Twilight\\" and comments about how it doesn't live up to the hype so my expectations was low.  Plus I didn't have a clue what it was about.  It was basically a poor version of the film \\"Battle royale\\" amongst strangers for a PG13 setting instead of R rating.  Had I know that and bought into the hype - I would most likely not have liked it.  I found the writing was simplistic and it was predicable.  However, I was gripped enough to read it in 2 days to read it and I was entertained.  I will read the next one.
B005HSL626|5.0|in summer break, my friends had this app on there cell phones, and I.kept playing continuously! so when I.got this kindle fire on Xmas, I figured maybe icould download this Bc it was so fun..... I really recckmend this.app to anyone! happy slicing!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I can say, without uncertainty, that this is \\"Phantom\\" for the ages.  For those who've long wished for a filmed record of the stage show, this is as close as we'll ever get.  Filmed live at the glorious Royal Albert Hall for a special three-performance 25th Anniversary event in October 2011, Andrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA sparkles like never before, with 100 cast members, and a 100-piece orchestra.<br /><br />I now completely understand why Lloyd Webber personally selected Sierra Boggess and Ramin  Karimloo (the original London leads of his sequel \\"Love Never Dies\\", which closed a few weeks before the 25th Anniversary of PHANTOM) to once again play Christine and the Phantom.  Their chemistry is like nothing else I've ever witnessed.  And only by playing opposite each other for quite some time can a set of Christine/Phantom's ever hope to match it.  The stage literally quivers when the pair first comes together, and by the time they've performed their erotic Act 2 duet \\"The Point of No Return\\", let's just say that fireworks wouldn't do them justice.  Ms Boggess will particularly astound you with her incredible acting performance as Christine - very rarely have I encountered such a full-blooded Christine in the many times I've seen the show onstage.<br /><br />There are naturally some shortcomings and restrictions in performing the full PHANTOM in a concert hall space.  Gone are some of the more spectacular effects (the famous chandelier no longer rises or falls but \\"explodes\\" at the climax of Act 1 with the aid of some pyrotechnic magic).  LED background projections provide the various scene changes; however the entire thing is closely modelled after the original Maria Bjornson designs - right down to the golden  proscenium arch.  PHANTOM purists will appreciate the lengths that have been taken to present the show in its signature look.<br /><br />The rest of the principals have all been associated with their PHANTOM roles in the past, with the exception being Hadley Fraser as Raoul.  Fraser's debut as Raoul is amongst the finest I've witnessed, taking who can be a rather prissy one-dimensional hero to a man who is a more than worthy adversary for the Phantom.<br /><br />Liz Robertson is Madame Giry (in addition to the London production she has also played Giry in \\"Love Never Dies\\"), and the opera house managers are played by Barry James and Gareth Snook.  Wendy Ferguson (one of the best Carlotta's from PHANTOM's London run) came in at the last minute to replace an actual opera singer who had been cast as Carlotta, but who had fallen ill.  Ferguson's Carlotta is a much more sympathetic character than what is usually played, and she is truly deserving of having her performance finally documented here.  Wynne Evans plays Piangi, whilst international ballet star Sergei Polunin dances the Slave Master in \\"Hannibal\\" as well as the lead role in the \\"Il Muto\\" ballet.<br /><br />More surprises are revealed during the \\"Grand Finale\\" as Andrew Lloyd Webber brings Michael Crawford, the surviving original London cast members and the creative team onstage for a well-deserved ovation.  Sarah Brightman, backed by three of the best past Phantom's - Colm Wilkinson (Canada), Anthony Warlow (Australia) and John Owen-Jones (London) in addition to London's next Phantom, Peter Joback, then sing the Title Song as well as \\"Music of the Night\\".<br /><br />If you have been touched by the magic of PHANTOM you'll need to grab a copy of this.  It's \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" for the ages.ul.

B003VIW8DK|2.0|I have almost all Roxy Music CD's and Bryan Ferry's solo work also. \\"Olympia\\" was a huge disappointment! There was nothing that stood out. It was pretty blah and boring.

B006UG90RM|5.0|I never thought I'd hear another Real Van Halen album, but here it is. It's like all those awful years with Sammy Hagar never happened. It's time to put those nightmare years behind us, chill some brewskis, and kick out the jams!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Van Halen with Hagar (and even Cherone) was good.  With Roth...they are one of the great bands of all time.  It's just that simple.  DLR brings a swagger and an attitude that shows up not only in the singing, but in everything this band is about.  It separates them from the pack and puts them at an elite level that few bands can match.  You can talk about Hagar being a better singer, Michael Anthony being better than Wofie...none of that matters.  Van Halen is better with Roth, and \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" proves it.  Is this album as good as their earlier work with Roth?  In a word...YES!  It's not their very best, but it's better than everything with Hagar, and it's better than 1984, Diver Down, and maybe even Fair Warning from the previous Roth days.  It flat out rocks from beginning to end, especially \\"As Is\\", \\"Outta Space\\", \\"Stay Frosty\\", and my favorite song on the disc, \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll.\\"  If you like Van Halen the way they are truly meant to be, you've got to get this album.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|I bought this CD because I like the song \\"Business as usual\\", but when I listened the complete album I know my purchasing was worthed.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|This is the bomb for review and reading .pdf documents on the Kindle Fire. Bookmarking, highlighting, annotating, are all now a breeze.

It took me a while to realize that the annotation features are triggered by pressing on the screen for a couple of seconds to reveal the menu.
1932735410|4.0|I used this book along with offcourse PMBOK 4th edition to pass the PMP.  I have not compared how well other practitioners have updated their books but this book aligns with PMBOK4 very well. Here's my plan for 3 months- (hrs a week really depends on your existing knowledge and how much time you can give)  6 weeks: Rita + PMBOK. Do ALL her exercises. Do NOT skip anything. Create an excel with column for attempt #1 and a tab for each chapter  4 weeks: revision. Rita and all those points you marked as \\"imp\\", highlighted and you got wrong. In your excel note attempt #2 and go through her end-of-chapter exercises. The ones that you got wrong AGAIN are your weak points. Read again.  1 week: Go online and find some practice sites. I do not want to post any links lest it sounds as recommendations. But there are sites which offer free questions. Use them as practice. See what you miss and read PMBOK. That also gets you in the mode of sitting down non-stop for 50/100/150 questions gradually  1 week: take time OFF. Highly recommended. Take practice tests. Here i wish i had got some test simulators from Rita or someone else. I used one site which offered an exam mode and did 2-3 exams.  Schedule exam for a Monday.. so if you cannot take time off for a week, at the least give 2 tests on the weekend.  Finally, the exam:  - Rita says most exams can be done in 2.5 hrs. The online site, i used to wrap up in 2 hrs. The actual exam was tougher. I took 3.5 hrs. Maybe i spent more time on some questions. I do not think 2.5 hrs is possible unless you are already in a PMO role. But thats me.  - The online sites do not come close in terms of complexity. I scored 85% in 2 hrs time. NOW PMI does not give any %. Just below, at par or above proficient. (I got 3 above and 2 at par).  - So Rita's questions come close in complexity to the real exam but i definitely recommend some PMBOK4 updated exam packages  Pros:  - Lot of PMP insight about what is material and what is nice-to-have for the exam  - Excellent exercises. I think that saved my exam  - Spot on in telling that you should assume you are managing a large multi-team $$$ project. That itself will help you get some answers right.  Cons:  - She has missed some aspects of the PMBOK.. very very few but i uncovered some when i took some online practice. For example: she does not talk about 'quality' and 'grade' in Quality management. I had skimmed the PMBOK there so i just missed it. But an important point. And  - Some questions and her rationale of answers i just dont agree. That could be subjective but in my real life that would NOT fly. If you have managed projects, you will find a few of these.  Best of luck!!

B006UG90RM|5.0|WOW....above and beyond what I was expecting.....  Saw them October of 1982 at Capital Center in landover MD. Excellent! (\\"After the fire\\" opened for them)  Never looked back on who my favorite rock band was after this concert.  Saw them again for the general Admission tour March 1984 at Capital Center in landover MD. Excellent  was crushed for 27 years....  Saw them September 29, 2007 at Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina. Excellent  (did they time-warp through 27 years.. sounded just as good....)  Saw them May 5, 2008 at RBC Center in Raleigh, North Carolina  just bought my VIP(first time)ticket for April 21, 2012 at Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina.  CANNOT WAIT  sword
B0067H9W72|3.0|walking dead second season is slow but necessary .  i've read other comments and they are okay and on point about it being slow also.  However zombie shows have unlimited potential.  walking dead atlanta meets walking dead chicago or wisconsin..hell ving rhames could show up from dawn of the dead and it'll add to the thrill of the show.  im still amazed how resident evil and underworld are going on 5 and 6 sequels apiece almost like starwars.  underworld is reaching next generation with the hybrid child i mean it will keep selling and people will keep watching.  i should get paid for my walking dead city to city  idea but its cool cuz its more ideas in my head..maybe unthought of yet.  the more universal things get the more potential..don't add vampires to the show please.  but u get my point.  i can't get into how much money they have to budget and use for the show.  I'm not into all that i'm just saying i'm looking forward to season 3.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|In my opinion, this movie has the best screen kiss ever, and James Stewart is the best screen kisser.  This is evident in his other movies also. He brings genuine feelings and emotions to all his acting scenes and his acting is so full of feeling. Just to mention some other films where he shows some great kisses, are Vertigo, Seventh Heaven, Rear Window, and the list goes on.  By the way, I think the worst screen kiss I ever saw was in the last scene of Miracle on 34th Street starring Natalie Wood, Maureen O'Hara and John Payne, and others.  It is the kiss between John Payne and Maureen O'Hara. It looked very harsh and with no finesse. It certainly did not fit in this type of movie as well.
0439023483|4.0|*** Spoilers***  A postapocalyptic world leaves one major city which is a futuristic metropolis. It's surrounded by 13 districts which by the start of the book has been reduced to 12 due to an uprising in the past.  The story follows two main protagonists Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. Each year the Capitol via state television hosts The Hunger Games. A sort of leathal Big Brother type show but shot in outdoor arenas and won buy surviving an every man for himself bloodbath.  This a home and back again type story which questions friendship, loyalty, self sacrifice and human endurance with plenty of good twists all along the way. I really enjoyed this book and found it difficult to put down.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Thanks for knocking it out of the park for the grand slam like I knew you could!  Every song is simply awe inspiring like the classic big 6!  What a return to form, giving the fans everything we could of hoped for in a classic Van Halen album.  The world is a better place because this cd exists in 2012, when hard rock is so sadly dead.  My dream has come true...I can leave this world now in peace, knowing Diamond Dave is rightfully back in the greatest hard rock band of all time.  God bless The Mighty Van Halen!

B002BWP49C|4.0|I like Twilight the most, Breaking Dawn second most, Eclipse third most, and New Moon 4th.  Twilight captivated me, Breaking Dawn tickled me, Eclipse soothed me, and New Moon dragged me along.  All three main characters showed more deep felt emotions in this movie than all the previous.  No sense going into the story line so I'll skip that, but this saga is pretty close to the book.  Most of the shots were \\"in doors\\" so you see more of the interior environment giving this segment more of a family feel.  Sorry no hot sex scenes--bedroom scenes yes, but no X rated sex scenes.  (The two disc special edition has a lot of behind the scene extras--explains Bella's pregnancy--it's a movie of its own and just as long--really would the extra bucks.)  What drove me batty is the different hair styles every Cullen member had in each saga: brown to blonde (ok, they could dye it), but short hair to long? (they could go from long to short as they cut it but you could only go so short because their hair don't grow back--that's my understanding anyway); and the wigs looked and screamed \\"wig, look at me, wig.\\"  The different hair styles in each saga sort of broke the continuity of the story line, especially for the vampires since they are incapable of changing but it seems they change more than the humans.  On the wedding day, Edward's hair looked absolutely horrible, like a dried mop laying flat on his head.  After New Moon, my brain kept registering the different vampirers' hair styles; for me this was the most annoying aspect of the series.  When I was able to push aside the variant head-dresses, I got wrap up in the arms of the movie's magic and was transported, however temporary, into a life other than my same-old, same-old, and I was delightfully entertained.  For 1:40 minutes my brain got to relax, my worries were suspended, and I dreamt along in that make believe world for many unattended minutes--and smiled for no reason other than my body's natural reaction responding to cues on the screen.  There is a little teaser segment after the end credits, so don't miss that.  I enjoyed Breaking Dawn tremendously and the bonus disc was really informative and interesting.

Even if you only love Vanilla, you won't be disappointed. :)

B005N0PJJO|5.0|In my opinion, this is the perfect middle for this story. The first book was our introduction to Christian and all his many shades of grey, but this was Ana's story. I love too see how Ms. James has captured a time that I remember so well. I remember being in my early 20s and having an older husband who all the girls loved to flirt with, the insecurities, the jealousy, the emotional highs and lows, and Ana experiences all of this during this second book. It's not often an author is able to resonate so deeply with me.  Loved, loved, loved this book. Have read it twice just to make sure it was as fab as I thought. :)

B003AQBYUG|5.0|I was hesitant buying an IMPORT Blu-ray, not knowing what to expect.  I'm sure others are in the same boat looking at this item and the reviews.  The one review that said the transfer was no good, well from my perspective, that just isn't true.  The film looked really good.  I've seen the Aliens move on all sorts of media, VHS, DVD, etc.  This is the first time on Blu-ray.  The movie looked really good to me.  Very clear, high def, etc.  Colors looked great. I'm just a regular person, who's seen Aliens about a million times, and watching it from this Blu-ray, it really looked nice.  Better than anything I've seen thus far. I had no issues with the playback, other than the long load times I get with every blu-ray I try to use on my Samsung player.  The packaging with this set is really compact.  I guess the USA version is larger, but this one is very small, which is nice.  The disks are in a plastic foldout case, unlike the USA version which looks like a foldout book.  This set is about the size of a small paperback, really small and nice.  So, don't go by the review that said the transfer wasn't any good, or the comment about noise.  The films looked great on my hardware, and I experienced nothing like that, at least not for Alien or Aliens.  I've not watched the other 2 yet.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app really helps to stay on track with a Bible reading plan. The choice of translations gave me some great options. The permission to share after each reading is a little annoying. There might be a way to turn that off, but I have not found it yet. I use this app regularily.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I very recently purchased a blu-ray player for my brand new HDTV, and I desperately wanted something I knew would look amazing in hi-def.  Needless to say, I went with Harry Potter (one of my all time favorites).  I wasn't particularly bothered by these not being the \\"special editions\\", and for what I paid for these, I thought the box set was quite nice.  The only odd thing I noticed was that these must either be Canadian editions or UK editions, since the ratings were a little out of the ordinary, and the first movie is \\"the Philosopher's Stone\\" vs \\"the Sorcerer's Stone\\", which is what I'm use to seeing.
B005EWDA3I|2.0|While books 1 and 2 were interesting, anybody looking for a resolution to the myriad of questions generated won't find the answers in book three. The work is interesting but it seems the Author just gave up in the end. I gave it a Star for each moon, probably more than it deserves.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Yes, I was very surprised when I gave this CD a spin. The tunes on this album are amazingly awesome. Eddie Van Halen shines with his energetic, upbeat, and utterly skillful playing. But the icing on the cake is David Lee Roth - he goes with Van Halen like peanut butter goes with jelly. Roth and Van Halen fit together like pieces of a puzzle. It just feels so right. Like the stars are aligned and something wonderful is going to happen. Admittedly, Roth has lost some of his high range but this doesn't detract from the magic contained on this disc. This is the opposite of death metal - it is life-affirming, glad to be alive metal. A really great album that I hope shoots to the top of the charts.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Truly a good choice on my part to get a cover for my Kindle Fire. It has made it much easier to handle, the leather is sturdy and soft to the touch. Over all worth the price. Went on very well and does not slip or cause any problems. A good choice if you read as much as I do. Protects and enhances.
B00005ASHM|5.0|In this modern day and age its easy to pinpoint the relevance of music albums because of their place in history. However,what's truly difficult is to consider those albums to sound as fresh and innovative as they were at the time of their release. Pet Sounds, however, makes it seem like the easiest task in the world. This is the case because, superficially, Pet Sounds is the first and main point of reference for the wide scope of innovations to come out of 60s' pop. It seems everything the 60s' had to offer to pop music were synthesized within the album; from the innovations of earlier craftsmen like Phil Spector and Burt Bacharach, the growth of the Baroque Pop aesthetic, and the California sunshine scene, all the way to the upcoming of Sgt. Pepper, late 60s' American psychedelia, and the Chamber/Twee Pop revival in the 1990s' (to which this album was heralded as a rosetta stone).  Sure, to must pundits this is all very possible to point out without even listening to the album. But once you get to listen to it, with the first listen it sounds as nothing The Beach Boys had ever done (or would do again). To be blunt, the album easily trashes out the Boys' entire previous catalogue, making it seem as if nothing was even listenable before Pet Sounds. This is of course not the case, the point being that the album is at such an elevated high from the (already good) albums of the rest of their catalogue.  Thats also not to say that this is a different style than their previous albums, its just that every element of the Boys' music was not perfected up until Pet Sounds. Their classic vocal harmonies are present; but Wilson multi-layers them into angelical synchronization. The pop hooks are still there; but Wilson adorns them with subtle juxtapositions of varied orchestrations (within the same song). The teenage melodramatic mood? Well in Pet Sounds it is transformed into timeless yearns for love, reciprocation, and meaning. See the pattern that emerges?  The one thing thats truly radical from the Boys' previous inputs, and arguably what gives Pet Sounds its sublimity, is the instrumentation. No longer are the Boys' reliant on just blues chord progression piano, surf-like guitar hooks and saxophone here and there. This time, Wilson is able to integrate the grandeur of his best songs (like California Girls and Don't Worry Baby) into a full fledged album. And not only that, he uses an full set orchestra to conceive it. This is not just your typical strings and brass however; Wilson goes all the way with timpani, french horns, vibraphone and harpsichord, among others. He even goes beyond orchestral instruments and brings in ukuleles, hammond organs, hawaiian percussion, accordion, hell you name it! Its just like one critic pointed out, the singles from Pet Sounds where the only time the Boys' met commercial success while being endlessly experimental.  The songs are as varied as the instrumentation as well. You have the sunshine-like opening of \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", the hauntingly sad \\"Don't Talk\\", the superficial fun of \\"Sloop John B.\\" and the anthemic \\"God Only Knows\\", just to mention a few examples. Hell, there are even a couple of instrumental tracks a-la Martin Denny! Be certain of one thing, there are NO high points and low points in this album, it all flows majestically like vintage wine from beginning to end.  Even though Pet Sounds is a mono recording (stereo listeners don't stop reading YET), Brian Wilson unmistakably manages the production output into an elaborate, wall-of-sound-alike work. That is to say, it is essentially mono, but the recording process of the orchestrations are in no way lessened. To be honest, I thought at first that it was a stereo recording, because I can notice the difference with some of the Boys' previous records, in which the instrumentation could sometimes be unbearably washed up. And its also a bona-fide experience to listen to it in mono, as Brian intended it to be. However if you're really into stereo, there is a stereo version of the album included (past the bonus track \\"Hang On To Your Ego\\").  To conclude, I believe that if you're going to buy just one 60s' pop album in your life then let Pet Sounds be that choice. I mean sure, you could pick up one of their much rivaled Beatles albums, but not even Sgt. Pepper matches the ornamental beauty of Pet Sounds, The Beach Boys one true magnum opus...although I am yet to listen to The Smile Sessions, so who knows if there's a contender...
0545265355|5.0|Bought these for my wife as Christmas gift. SHE LOVES THEM. I was told they are a very easy read and everyone will enjoy them. This hardback pack is very nice and verys practical if you plan on keeping them and reading them over and over. My wife has already read each book twice. I suggest these to any woman. But men on the other hand??? Hold onto your man card and just buy it for the woman in your life. Then wait until she falls asleep to read them. Just make sure you don't tell anyone. lol
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not all the games are self explanitory they should tell you how to play each game but thee than that the games are pretty fun and are kind of addicting
B006UG90RM|1.0|The new album is just plain terrible. After all these years that's all they can come up with? Talk about outdated. I used to listen to Van Halen all the time but I can't stomach this one. Let it go boys.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|game is pretty good. I do wish the games were a little bit easier, but has a lot of fun games.

1594203059|5.0|His Highness the Aga Khan once commented that Huntington's thesis about A Clash of Civilisations was misguided! The real clash is ignorance. in this book Niall Ferguson makes  us understand that there is or there are no clashes of civilizations through a painstaking examination of different civilizations, drawing their differences and showing how the qualities of each over time achieved pre-eminence. A world of greater tolerance and respect for diversity, cultural and religious is beautifully clarified in this book. One is made to appreciate, for example, that the quality of and respect for institutions underlies some of the differential progress and prosperity between the west and the rest. The discussion about what constitutes the \\"west\\" in this context is  Interesting. As countries  adopt and respect firm and values based institutions, so do they shift from being part of the \\"rest\\" to being part of the \\"west\\". This book is recommended reading in a world where there is great deal of confusion and raptures misinformed by ostensible theories of clash of civilizations.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I was stationed in Japan when this film came out and was taken to it by a very close friend. At the time I couldn't understand the language, but the story was truly amazing. My friend helped me to understand what was going on throughout the movie. Being with her (two Americans, surrounded by Japanese) helped make this an amazing film and memory. The richness of the story was magically enhance by the music, and it is the music which has stayed with me for all of these years. I've only been able to see this film one other time, also in Japanese, and still it was an amazing production well worth owning and watching. I know the events surrounding my first viewing have colored my view of this film, but I also know this movie is one of the finest examples of Japanese animation. When compared with other Western animation from the same time period and more recently \\"Princess Mononoke\\" is far superior in design, quality, story, and music. No this isn't a film for small children, the violence and story would be difficult for them to understand, as I'm fairly certain it is difficult for many adults to comprehend due to the cultural/mythological themes used. Still I would strongly recommend this film to anyone interested in seeing a great story with good music and rich animation. This film can stand up next to any film being produced by Disney or any other animation studio - then and now!
0385342063|5.0|In three words: vintage Sophie Kinsella. Poppy is hilarious. Right off the bat I knew I'd like her. She's a good person, she's happy and she's getting married to someone she's dated for a few months; Magnus. The thing about Poppy is she's a little scatterbrained, which leds to her misplacing her engagement ring...a family heirloom! She's in such a state that she's not aware of her surroundings and her phone gets snatched. Like most of us, her phone is the ties to her life. Somehow she finds a phone that was pitched in the trash and decides to use it. This is where the story gets funny and endearing.  I think we all know where the book is going to end up but it's the ride that carries the book. Poppy gets herself into all sorts of trouble by trying to be helpful. She's just that kind of person to try to help someone she views as needing help. She sees Sam as uptight and made of stone. He sees her as a people pleaser with an inability to stand up for herself. Are they both right? I'm not going to spoil that for you.  The way that  Ms. Kinsella tells a good portion of the story is through the text and emails that Sam and Poppy send back and forth, along with commentary by Poppy. We also get to know more of Poppy's thoughts through the use of footnotes. I have to say at first I found them a bit annoying but I did get used to them and they did add a bit of humor to the story (not that it didn't have it in the regular text). Of course there is always some kind of misunderstanding but it was clever and charming. As always, the secondary characters were colorful and different from each other. No one was a cookie cutter or stereotypical character.  This is definitely high up there on my list of favorite Sophie Kinsella books but I will always recommend Can You Keep a Secret?, Twenties Girl and The Undomestic Goddess religiously.  If you are a fan of Sophie Kinsella's books, then you definitely shouldn't miss out on I've Got Your Number.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Nice game with good storyline and fun activities.  Only challenging part is where they need something to stand on.  There should be a hint to guide folks there.  WARNING - This app is VERY large.  This one app takes up ONE FOURTH of all app storage on the Kindle Fire.
0143119680|2.0|I am very glad I borrowed this book from the library; I think I would be very upset if I had bought it. I was so excited to start reading it and love supernatural novels. While Diana is very likeable as well as Matthew, I just felt it all sounded like they were in High School again. Just the witches warnings, and well everyone didn't seem very adult to me at all. I stopped reading half way, I was forcing myself to finish, but I just don't care anymore.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|The soundtrack is great, just like the film. It captures emotion perfectly. Full of great score and music from some great creators and artists. This is a must have! Reminds me of 80s music, but not the cheesy/crap kind...the kind you wish would still be around today!
0812548094|5.0|The Sword of Truth series is just one long story separated into 12 books. Stone of Tears is the second chapter and, as in the previous book, is well written.  The only issue someone might have is that every minute detail, no matter how small, is included. Someone might find that a little tedious to read, and someone else might find it makes the story more enjoyable. I'm in the middle as sometimes the detail seems to take just too many pages, and yet, later in the story, in most cases, you find the information useful.  Simply put, I am enjoying this series tremendously.
0142800805|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read. The first time was nearly ten years ago, and I wanted to re-visit the story, so I got the audio version. It's done excellently. I highly recommend the book -- either way!
B006FE83U4|5.0|Universal is definitely getting its act together with film restoration. To Kill A Mockingbird looks like it was shot yesterday. I'm mystified that some person dissed the visual quality of this blu-ray. Guess you can't please some people even if you do a fantastic job... like with this title! Not much need to discuss the film. It's a classic. What can you say? Peck's greatest role. A story that still resonates after all these years.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its pretty cool.  bunker u have to play games a million times to get points to vet more.  games unlocked.  but all n all its fun.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|The new update did not work. I installed today, no new levels. Please fix and I will rate 5 stars.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|Sophie Kinsella is known for light-hearted funny reads that any woman can relate to. Twenties Girl is a little different from her other novels in that it involves two main heroines, Sadie and her great-niece.  I found both to be very entertaining but also lacking at the same time which is why I didn't give this novel five stars.  The great-niece was simply too focused on getting her ex-boyfriend back and Sadie was very entertaining but it felt like there should be something more to her.  However there were some very entertaining jams that both characters got themselves in and ultimately each character did come full circle by the end.
0061766089|3.0|This is a fantastic book for anyone interested in getting the 36000 feet view of what it means and how it needs to be approached from an organisation's perspective. There are hints on how to apply design thinking in personal context but the book is primarily for those looking at design thinking in context of an organisation.<br /><br />For a book on 'design thinking', I wish the book was designed around its readers - The case studies are thin on details and read more like documented hearsay. The mind-map embedded into the covers of this book will tell you that the book should have been edited to about 60% of its length. The ideas and insights on this book are hidden between the titles and quite often in those one-liners from Tim that are embedded deep within prosaic paragraphs.<br /><br />Overall, a good book to get initiated to the paradigm of design thinking but don't expect depth on the 'How'parts.If you are a persistent reader and read the book twice/thrice( as I did), you'll be able to build a meta-framework on design thinking!
B004I1WIWU|5.0|Simply amazing record. Extremely well produced and the sound is exceptional. Not all vinyl sounds impressive, this one however does.
0307949508|5.0|Totally hooked on this series.  Looking forward to \\"hornets nest\\" which is out 2/12..can't wait..already ordered. The movie is out now and will see it..but nothing better than reading the book.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Okay, okay... I will admit when I heard Tattoo on the `net for the first time a few Q marks found their way into my head! But then after a few more listens and a viewing of Dave`s thoughts into what made the lyrics for the song I started to appreciate it much more. Not only from a lyric point of view but also a musical one. It is a good tune actually, just not what you`d expect, especially as a lead-off single.... Anyway, the album... What can I say?? Homage must be paid and in spades to Van Halen!!  It has been a LAMENTABLE 28 years since 1984 changed the lives of so many rockers but having listened over and again to A Different Kind Of Truth one thing is blatant...it is a stroke of genius! To basically smooth over 28 years of arrid wilderness in just one album is a trick that no other band has ever been able to pull off successfully. But such is the brainchild of the producer and VH.. The older fans can hark back to the Big V`s golden years catching glimpses of the seventies and eighties songs mixed skillfully to sound like new ones and the new ears that hear this album will just be blown away by the sheer virtuosity of Eddie, Alex, Wolfy and the slightly rough but still sparkling Diamond Dave!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I was actually surprised how entertaining these games are and play them to pass time during breaks at work!  I would recommend this application.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game keeps you on your toes. I'm only a few games in at the moment but so far its really good.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|I had the regular DVD of this film, watched a couple of times. I can even say that I can repeat a good part of the dialogues by myself. Well, this Skynet Edition really surprised me. I saw a lot of unseen-before scenes (I´m the only one?), special PIP during the film with lots of new stuff, like making-ofs, visual effects reviews, and so on. And the commentaries are valuable, not like some films that the director begins to talk bla-bla-bla-lalala-etc-etc, and do not speaks about the film..... As per sound and image, I only can say this: fantastic.  Very interesting, a must-have in all collections.
B00479SVBU|3.0|I bought this to use with my iPod in the car. I have a big 160 GB iPod. This product is only compatible with MP3 players up to 32 GB. It says that nowhere on the product description on the Amazon web site, but says it plainly on the packaging on the transmitter. It's going back.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Been happy with this game since I bought it. Has always worked perfectly and have yet to find a game like it that comes close.
B005OZ4E3A|5.0|In my opinion it is her best CD to date.  And I have them all.  (in Italian).  I like the energy on this Album and the nice touching songs as well.  I used to like Io Canto the best.  But this is even better!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|this game is so cool it even let me castle and I'm10.But either way its a fun game and the people that don't know how to play chess stop weighting not true reviews. (Go Chess).

0375842209|5.0|I read the first page or two and had to reread - then I realized it was Death's perspective.  Such a good book, funny, sad, heartbreaking - this book evoked all my emotions.  Loved it!  Haven't read anything this good in a long time!
B004J4WLPU|5.0|I must say that this is the best book that I have read in a while. Thriller fans, please don't let my title confuse you. This book did keep me on the edge of my seat, but less from the \\"thriller\\" aspect. I absolutely thrive on emotional turmoil, not the surface kind you find in soap operas, but the deep heart wrenching, breath stopping, earth shattering kind of emotional turmoil. I thoroughly enjoyed following Bee as she tells her story, and tells her sister's story. The dynamics of sisterhood are constantly changing, and it was refreshing to see the inside of another's relationship.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is addictive I would recommend it for you get this app. it has all fun games to play for kindle fire.
0307593312|5.0|I have read nearly all of Murakami's works.  This ranks as one of his best.  I see a lot of complaints that the book is slow; however, if you understand Murakami, you'll know that he will get there when he gets there.  He doesn't fill the slow periods with other stories as he did in Windup Bird Chronicles.  He lets the characters develop relationships slowly, as they do in their everyday lives.  The main characters are broken people, living in a skewed world.  Most of their lives are dull.  We are the voyeurs, watching them live these lives.  If this is a dull book, The Brothers Karamazov is a dull book...Moby Dick is a dull book.  Tom Clancy will give you something with a formula that doesn't let you down.  This book is better than that.  There is a soft beauty to it.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop is a great desktop connect client.  I especially love the connect to gmail feature. Using that, I can access my computer remotely from any network!  Nice for watching movies in bed or retrieving files from my home computer at work.  And once you get used to the zoom and clicking features, it's comfortable enough to use for desktop-style web browsing from my phone, with no worries about missing plugins!  Makes me regret the times I turn my computer off before leaving the house.  There's a good reason this app is highly rated and widely recommended.  Lovin it!

B006UG90RM|5.0|I have been waiting for new Van Halen material with David Lee Roth since 1984 (well there were those two songs on the Greatest Hits album in 1995, but all that did was wet my appetite)... Like many other reviews I read here, I was skeptical after hearing the 1st single, Tattoo.  But it was still Van Halen fronted by Dave, and the more I listened, the more I liked it.  Having said that, I just listened to \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" in its entirety, twice today.  I'm blown away.  It is so beyond my greatest expectations. And even though the CD rocks hard, the music on it has quite a variety.  From the powerful hook radio tunes, \\"Big River\\" (my favorite,) \\"You and Your Blues,\\" (a close second), and \\"Blood and Fire\\" and \\"Beat's Workin'\\", to the bluesy, soulful rocker \\"Stay Frosty,\\"  to high octane \\"Fair Warning style\\" rockers \\"China Town, As is, Outta Space and Honeysweetbabiedoll,\\" to a time warped equal to \\"Runnin' with the Devil in \\"She's the Woman,\\" and final a modern rock anthem in \\"The Trouble with Never,\\" there is something for all Van Halen fans on this CD (unless you are a Van Hagar junkie, or you like lots of keyboards).  The musicianship is phenomenal, but I think what really adds the pizzazz that we've been missing for nearly 30 years are David Lee Roth's lyrics and his trademark wails, yelps, and outbursts spread throughout the material.  His lyricism is so irreverent, (e.g, \\"I want to be your knight in shiny pickup truck\\" and \\"mousewife to momshell in the time it took to get that new tattoo.\\"  I LOVE IT!!!  At any rate, buy this CD and support this great music.  Let's send a message to Van Halen and the record industry that we want more of this!!!!!
B004YXE438|5.0|This is an excellent app.  The photos used for the puzzles are beautiful and high resolution. A lot of puzzles come with it plus you can buy  additional  expansion pack for not much money.

B000002KM6|5.0|Since the 70's drew to a close,there'd been increasing tensions between Eddie Van Halen and David Lee Roth over which element of the bands sound would triumph;the vocal and performance theatrics of Diamond Dave or Eddie's musicianship. Truth be told,both were equally important. But hey. Look at the Byrds,The Kinks and The Sex Pistols. These bands seemed to thrive creatively in states of near constant bickering and rivalry-challenging the other party they dealt with to do just a little bit better. So they battle raged on this fourth Van Halen set. And what are they doing to advance their the whole project? The pair along with the other two members of the band are kind of challenging each other internally with new and different musical ideas very atypical of Van Halen thus far,seeing how they could make it work for themselves and their audience. In the end this album wasn't a big commercial dynamo at all.  But the end result is probably,to my hears one of the most musically advanced and penetrating album I've heard them do. And likely one of my very favorites.<br /><br />  Never shying from a good groove at any time,one thing about this album is it rocks yes. But it doesn't rock as hard or noisily as some of their earlier ones did. It's not as greasy or spiky. The rockier songs \\"Dirty Movies\\",\\"Sinner's Swing\\",\\"Unchained\\" and \\"Hear About It Later\\" don't really seem to be that dominant of the album. And most important they rely more on texture and bassy sounds than rocking upfront guitar solos. One thing I really like about this album is it's open and proud emphasis on funkiness. \\"Mean Street\\" comes out of this rocking,slower groove and is probably the funkiest Van Halen album opener. \\"Push Comes To Show\\" is not only my favorite song here,and funky but sophistifunk at that-with heavy layered keyboard sounds and a more arranged production within the groove. \\"So Is The Love?\\" has a soulful boogie rock flavor to it. And there's some out and out experimental,almost electronic/new wave type flavors on \\"Sunday Afternoon In The Part\\" before the faster guitar rock does return on \\"One Foot Out The Door\\"<br /><br />  On an album matching themes of confrontation and attitude with music that doesn't always sound like anything Van Halen had yet done up to this point,you can really understand how significant it was that the members of the band chose a funk groove as an instrumental mediation tool as it were to try to solve their conflicts. For one,it's not a rhythmic pattern that tends to emphasize much \\"guitar hero\\" type antics. Even a lead guitarist soloist in that music is generally forced to keep it clean somehow and melt into the rhythmic complexities of the musical whole. And even on the harder rockers here,there is this interesting sense of unity among the players. Especially considering the two titanic egos of the band were on an emotional collision course during these sessions. It's solid proof that if handled right even rock and roll,a musical genre often revolved around the most decedent of megalomaniacs,can weather some difficult personal problems if they can find a way to resolve it through new and challenging musical idioms. While few people really absorbed it that heavily in it's time,it's for sure one of the bands most purely creative triumphs and showed they were a lot more than your simple proto hair metal arena band.e type flavors on \\"Sunday Afternoon In The Part\\" before the faster guitar rock does return on \\"One Foot Out The Door\\"    On an album matching themes of confrontation and attitude with music that doesn't always sound like anything Van Halen had yet done up to this point,you can really understand how significant it was that the members of the band chose a funk groove as an instrumental mediation tool as it were to try to solve their conflicts.

B00004Y6OA|4.0|Well the 1980's had arrived. And Van Halen had two big smash hit albums in a row with their debut [[ASIN:B00004Y6O9 Van Halen]] and the follow up [[ASIN:B00004Y6O8 Van Halen II]],which are both ideal additions to the collection of any rock and roll fan. They had enough charisma and instrumental talent to fill rock clubs and stadiums of all sorts. But they weren't idiots either. They knew they they couldn't just clone a good thing again and again just to keep their relationship stable with the public. They had to take some calculated risks. This era wasn't a good time for that. There was a crossroads going on. And as with many people Van Halen needed to contend as to how far they'd get caught up in the tide. So here they decided to dig as deep as they can into their type of rock music. The band on the cover are depicted in a suggestive huddling \\"hump\\" of Van Halen's axe. And the inside photo of Diamond Dave whering nothing but those ultra tight black leather pants of his alone with his hands literally chained? Well that photography says more about what's hear then you might think.<br /><br />  Where one might view Roth's lustiness on their first two albums as being almost playful in a masculine adult sort of way,the theme of this album is sexual aggression and what leads up to it. They start right off with the more catchy hit song \\"And The Cradle Will Rock\\" pretty much right off. I am not sure if this album was quite the success of the first two commercially. Aside from that this is still a very clean and sleekly produced album. But much louder and faster rock overall. On songs like \\"Fools\\",\\"Tora! Tora!\\" and \\"Loss Of Control\\" Roth and Eddie are both lyrically and musically exploring the impulsive sexual jungle attitude that most rock stars embrace on a surface level. But it goes a little deeper into the motivations of ones physical desires. Diamond Dave sings it,Eddie plays it,with some of his solos downright masturbatory. The blues comes into it on the main diversion from the hard rock on \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\",interestingly enough the albums source of wit and reflection.<br /><br />  While I'd hardly describe this album as overly intellectual,it's not exactly possessed of the same kind of reckless abandon that the first two records possessed. These are people and musicians looking more into the face of maturity. And how to do what they do as they continue to age. It's only appropriate that,considering even as tough rocking as this album is that it runs so deeply into the blues. These songs make no apologies,they never complain. They just kind of let you know that some of these guys are sexually frustrated,are in need of an outlet and maybe some past repression might have a part to play it in. I don't think anyone intended this to be about the door closing on the sexual revolution. But somehow it's there. And it's only appropriate this album is somewhat darker,if not cynical and negative. It isn't grunge,goth or mope rock or anything like that. It just deals with the rock n roll attitude with a little more reflection. And allows Eddie to continue expanding his soloing style along the way. Not one of the bands better known albums. But very important to their future development.hard rock on \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\",interestingly enough the albums source of wit and reflection.

0062082353|1.0|This book is fascinating, in a sickly perverted way... the diary of a man so twisted by the military brainwashing that he completely lost ability to recognize motivations and emotions of other humans. A true warrior recognizes valor of enemy, and understands that what he has to do is deeply regrettable, and is nothing to brag about; you can tell him by his unwillingness to talk about war.  Even the body-count bragging is empty - the guy who punched the bomb release button on Enola Gay killed way more people than this \\"hero\\". (Even as a sniper he's far from being a champion... Ivan Mitrofanov made 1079 confimed kills, and he didn't shoot civilians - only Nazi soldiers; Kyle doesn't even make the most-lethal hundred list - girls like Lydmila Pavlichenko and Nina Lobkovskaya were more lethal than this macho man).  I expected some introspection and some soul-searching - and, yes, some insight. What I got is puerile bravado and jingoism. Wasted time.

0525478817|5.0|This is not the type of book I would normally read, and one I would frankly have avoided when I found out that the main characters meet in a Cancer Support Group.  You can almost see the reach for the kleenex just by reading the book description.  However, I had to find out why this book was getting such amazing reviews, and finally downloaded a sample on my Kindle.  I was hooked on the sample.  As another reviewer has noted, this is not a \\"cancer book.\\"  Yes, there is a moment that involves tears and heartbreak, but almost immediately after that an unbelievably laugh out loud moment that had me in tears for completely different reasons.  I can't help but give John Green kudos for making me feel such a gamut of emotions, that still left me feeling good at the end of the book.  This book made you think about life and family and romance and wonderful hopeful things, despite being based on a terminal illness.  I am still thinking about the well-drawn main characters, Hazel and Augustus, and even the secondary characters comprised of their family and support group friends like Isaac.  This is not a typical read, and isn't shaking things up what makes life interesting after all?

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I use this to transfer files to and from my phone. It's much easier than finding a cable then mounting and unmounting drives. It's not secure, but honestly, who would just leave it running? And, if the network. you're connecting to is so compromised that someone is likely to breach your phone in the five minutes it takes to transfer some files, you might have bigger security issues to deal with.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|This series is something I have heard about for a while but never had a chance to watch for myself. So, I netflicked and guess what? It turns out to be a well filmed, well shot, and well written series that was very smart and just violent enough for a gangster movie. I mean it was a refreshing change from other gangster series on HBO, with the added plus of containing vivid imagery. All in all, this series is a winner and I would suggest it to anyone.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Let's say up front that I never bought into the whole David vs. Sammy thing.  I never called Van Halen \\"Van Hagar\\" when Sammy was in the band.  While I loved all of the early Van Halen albums (still do), I was just as crazy about the Van Halen albums with Sammy up front.<br /><br />What's astonishing is just how FRIGGIN' GOOD Sammy still is after all these years.  The guy hasn't lost a step.  He is incredible on this album.<br /><br />I think it was a great choice sticking with Michael Anthony, and an even better choice bringing on Joe Satriani.  (You may or may not recall how David Lee Roth picked up Steve Vai when he went solo.  Probably the only real contender on the planet to set up against Eddie Van Halen.  Well, Joe Satriani was Steve Vai's instructor.  Satriani might be the third worthy candidate to roll with these rockers.)<br /><br />The way the band comes together on this album is some kind of magnificent.  They play together as if they were made for each other.  Everything is TIGHT and STRONG.  The riffs are awesome, the guitar tone exquisite, the bass and drums driving (in the way VH fans will definitely appreciate).<br /><br />Altogether -- great album.  Great songs.  And an amazingly fluid and flawless super-concoction of killer talent.<br /><br />Great stuff.<br /><br />Great, great stuff.

B0059XTTXC|5.0|yes, its slowly paced, yes there is little in the way of bond-esque action. to many american viewers it seems this is a deterrant. me? i eat this kind of slow burning, paranoid spy story up with a spoon.  alfredson brilliantly directs the film, subtle camera movements and angles, duller, drab colour schemes perfectly reflecting the look, the feel, the atmosphere of early 70's europe. the production design is superb, every single element of the mis en scen felt authentic.  the plot is labrynthine, but a 2nd viewing will reward viewers with a richer experience now that theyre able to piece together the plot elements that lead to the unmasking of the mole. this is a film that will really reward multiple views. the cast is phenomenal, a who's-who of british acting royalty, and as you'd expect, the acting is top notch.  what can i say, i loved every minute of it!

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised how nice this case is.  And the pink back cover is a pretty color.  The front is black, accordian style with the ability to flip to the back to use as a stand,  It works well, too.  Very sturdy. The elastic strap is fastened well.  My first Kindle cover had an elastic strap and has held up very well.  I expect no less of this one.  I would definitely recommend this for a good protection.  Light weight, nice feel in the hand.
B004MOMT2M|1.0|I honestly mean no disrespect, but I have no idea what the others are raving about with this DVD Audio disc.  And more importantly, I love Rush and have enormous respect for them, which is why I was utterly shocked at the pitiful results of this project.<br /><br />In their defense, perhaps my expectations were way too high, because the DVD Audio disc that inspired me to seek more DVD Audio discs (Steely Dan - Everything Must Go) is nothing short of incredible, both in terms of the fidelity and the thoughtful steering of the effects and instruments into the surround channels.  Obviously this comparison pits a disc using state-of-the-art digital recording technology versus an album recorded in 1980.<br /><br />That said, if you can't do something right, then don't do it at all.  I have two surround systems in my home, one an extremely high resolution system with my Home Theater used for critical listening, and a second surround sound system for more casual listening, but still stocked with very good gear.<br /><br />Sadly, on my high end system, it sounded worse, because it reveals all.  Quite frankly, my first reaction was somebody took the original CD, ran it through some cheap first generation DSP receiver from around 1990, flipped on 'Hall' mode, and created the DVD Audio disc from that.  It's awful.  And if the point was to make this studio album sound more \\"Live\\", why???  If you want to hear Rush Live, buy one of their concert DVD's; now at least you can watch them too.<br /><br />If anything, the goal should have been to make this sound more intimate.  For example, the pictures and the videos on the disc show them in their recording studio. Don't get excited, the addition of these look just as much as an uninspired afterthought as the DVD Audio disc.  But the point is, I would have loved to be in that studio listening to them jamming with Neil right in front of me, Geddy to my left (or right) and Alex on the other side.  Now you've got something.<br /><br />Then, if you're really going to \\"remaster\\" it, let's work on that.  I detected no improvement in clarity, depth or space between the instruments, only the artificial ambiance, or was that tape hiss?  More importantly, the dynamic range was lacking; I didn't feel the attack you would expect on Neil Peart's drum strikes. The whole thing felt compressed to me. Even the reviewers here who liked it also noted the surround effects were subtle...  to say the least.  Yes, there are a few moments where some instruments and effects zing across the room, but against the backdrop of this otherwise poor effort, it's way too little to save it or to justify spending the money.<br /><br />If you're still reading this, you get the point, I'll quit ranting. If your dog used your Moving Pictures CD for a chew toy, then go ahead and buy this, otherwise save your money!work on that.

B005OZE9SA|2.0|This is just not compatible with Windows 7.  I gave it two stars, because for all I know, the preamps might sound great.  But I never got a chance to try it.  I'm using 64-bit Windows 7.  I use Sonar as my DAW.  The drivers wouldn't install either from the CD or when downloaded from their website.  Nice, sturdy construction.  Maybe it's worth a try.  I bought a Tascam US-200 instead.  It works fine with Windows 7.  Almost zero latency.  Great price, too.

It can be used as an easy to read history book or even as a bedtime storytelling book.
B000002LK1|5.0|Seriously, I should have done this review a long time ago. I got this album when I was 14, and I have never laid it aside since then, despite my more recent interest in metal music.<br /><br />So why do I entitle this review as I have? Well, for one thing, the lyrics really do touch me with their amazing flow and depth. True that some of them are a bit dark in contrast with their earlier stuff from the 80s, but one has to realize that life is not all about being happy all the time. Also, the catchy beats and creative sampling, coupled with the use of synthesizer and piano lines makes for a truly poweful sound. Finally, Dave Gahan's deep and imposing voice tops it off by bringing the lyrics to life, though Martin Gore sings lead on \\"Sweetest Perfection\\" and \\"Blue Dress\\" and with a more light-hearted airy tone, but still just as amazing. When it all fits together, it is truly a work of art.<br /><br />Overall, I think that every song is amazing, be it the fast-driven bluntness of \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" or \\"Policy Of Truth\\" or the airy mystique of \\"Waiting For The Night\\" or \\"Blue Dress\\". This album is proof of the fact that hard work on the part of the artists themselves truly does pay off, and they become successful for the right reasons, unlike alot of the overcommercialized no-talent hacks we have now, who seem to have their success simply handed to them.<br /><br />Sadly, there might not ever be another group quite like Depeche Mode, but at least we have great albums like this to remind us of how wonderful pop music used to be.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this on my iphone , kindle, and work pc for all my notes!  Easy to use and categorize notes.  I love the web clip function.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|I had been looking at this item for a few months trying to decide if it was really worth the money.  It was!!  Installation took about 15 minutes , mostly which consisted of getting the wine holder level and making sure the holes were alligned.  I highly recommend you get at least 50lb drywall anchors, it's worth the $2.00 and trip to the hardware store to not have the thing come out of the wall when fully loaded with wine bottles. (which could probably weigh anywhere between 25-35lbs when all eight bottles are in) It really is beautiful and a showpiece in the room.
B006UG90RM|2.0|There is a couple of OK songs in this album but for the most part it is a dissapointment.  David Lee Roth's voice is not even close to what it used to be and to make it worse they are really missing Michael Anthony's backing vocals.  Eddie is still great for the most part but most of the songs are just weak.  I was not expecting this album to be as good as the 70's or 80's material but this is just not good.

B004A8ZWW4|1.0|And that's what life's all about: booze, deceit, loose women<br />and brawling robots. Just brush aside any kid that happens to<br />pop into the picture and complicate things, especially if said<br />kid is a reflection of your own deplorable self. These confused<br />women just don't understand though, you have a life of arrested<br />development to get back to by grabbing that controller and<br />expressing that inner rage through an obnoxious hunk of metal.<br />So, when that pesky kid tags along in some kind of pathetic<br />visitation right, just be assured that he's there as your spectator,<br />your cheerleader, as you further seek to relive your heyday. And<br />once that self-gratification is gone, take further relief in knowing<br />you can simply dump him back off into the lap of luxury, with<br />people that throw money around like you throw beer bottles. And<br />when that little pest needs a buddy of equal maturity to expel some<br />repressed rage with, he'll always have that evasive father to<br />call upon, and most likely down the road.... share booze, women<br />and beatings with.
B005HS00ZU|2.0|I just didn't like it. No big explanation. The 3D was so... unnoticeable. I didn't know most of his songs and he was so passive about his performance, nothing grabbed me. I want to step on the disc and fling it into the air.

1612130283|5.0|Where to even begin?  Fifty Shades of Grey is one heck of a book.  It has about everything you'd ever want in a book.  Love, suspense, mystery, action.  Wow!  You can't help but fall in love with sweet Anastasia from the beginning.  She is a little naive and a lot clumsy.  She says what's on her mind and doesn't think of the consequences.  She has no idea what she's getting into when she meets Mr. Christian Grey.  Gorgeous, uber-rich Christian Grey.  You fall for him right away, that's how charming he is.  You wish he were real or you were in the book to be able to just be with him.  You want to take care of him, date him, smack him, be with him, admire him, all the above.  He's just that amazing.  Ms. James has created an fantastic story with Fifty Shades of Grey.  I found that I was thinking about this book when I wasn't reading it.  When I was reading it, I didn't want to put it down.  I was so enamored of the whole story.  I feel I must include a warning in this review though.  This book does have some graphic sex/S&M.  It's a big part of the story indicating a big part of Christian.  If you don't care for that, then I wouldn't read it, otherwise, run don't walk to get this book!

It features many top artists of the time playing 2, 3, or four of there hits at two live concerts, London and Philadelphia on July 13th 1985. The best DVD in my collection, awesome! Have since bought 3 more for family after they had watched mine.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|\\"It's Not All About Me\\" is a concise and well thought out guide to quickly and easily build a rapport with anyone.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|The UK version is the best. Fine acting, Maggie Smith is terrific! This UK version has more in it than what's showing on PBS
0099465167|5.0|Mario Puzo had to solve an urgent financial problem, so I've heard, and essentially said, \\"&*%$! it, I'm gonna write a best-seller!\\"  THE GODFATHER was what he produced.  I remember reading it when it was first published, being gripped from the first paragraph - and realizing before it became common knowledge that some of what he wrote had to have been based on inside information.  Knowing people's secrets, though, didn't make this book the classic of its kind that it is: Puzo's art did that.  He deserved the payoff.  Ever since books began being manufactured with the so-called \\"perfect\\" binding (pages glued in rather than sewn), they tend to fall apart with use, especially paperbacks;  I replaced my original, demolished copy.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|Instead of dissecting in detail, I do like the album.  Wolfgang was purposely and consistently mixed UP with Eddie to form a solid wall of guitar.  Vocals and drums...solid as usual.  Let's face it...not many American bands could pull off this kind of record these woeful days....VH does it...they SOUND LIKE Van Halen.  Way to go, boys!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This staged production of the POTO is absolutely wonderful and renders the over the top film version of a few years back obsolete...this version of the original staging is brilliant, well sung and well acted. The costuming, staging, and orchestra top notch.  This is a perfectly fitting anniversary DVD for this occasion and it would be hard to better it.  Ramin Karimloo is perhaps the best phantom ever, his voice is wonderful and he can act with feeling, Sierra Boggess is also outstanding, and shows the right amount of emotion.  Hadley Fraser is so much better than the Raul in the movie - actually believable and has an amazing voice.  All in all this DVD is well worth owning and having now seen it on stage, the movie version and now this one, I have to say this one is the best.<br /><br />Personally I could have lived without Sarah Brightman at the end, she is so over the top and she is so in love with herself, she gets on my last nerve.  I would have preferred the DVD to end with the cast and Andrew introducing some people etc, but without the singing - I would have liked to have closed my viewing with the memory of Karimloo and Boggess singing and not Brightman, in future I will not watch that part.  Still worth every penny, soundtrack as well.

1451627289|5.0|Stephen King can write!  Anyone who says different simply cannot recognize what good writing is all about.  That is, it's about characters.  No one creates characters like SK.11/22/63 is long, but good long books are like friends: you enjoy their company and when you have to part, you are reluctant to do so. The research, is pretty darn good too!  You are transported back, like Jake, and you are called to witness what 48 to 50 years really means.

This apparently came pre-installed on my phone so I decided to give it a go.  Couldn't be happier with it.  I purchase my books through my phone and read them right then and there.  I carry my phone with me all the time, so now I can read my books at my convenience.  It's a great app overall.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|I am a huge fan of any kind of medieval movie, especially when it is mixed with Sci Fi, so I had my doubts when I read the storyline of this movie. However, when I saw it I was pleasantly surprised.  It is kind of a combination of 13th Warrior and Beowulf stories, and the result was actually better than 13W or any of the various Beowulf movies out there. Although I wouldn't say that the history is totally accurate, which is why I only give it a 4, I still recommend it for anybody who is a sci fi and/or a medieval history fan.

B00005RG6M|1.0|I can not comment about this DVD-A sound quality in multichannel because I am a stereo guy. I bought it recently (I thought I was lucky finding a new, unopened item in a very old cd store) but after listening I am not sure I was lucky: the two channel tracks do not sound as high resolution. As a matter of fact is a very lifeless, undetailed version of this magnificent music. I made A-B comparisons with my mofi version, and the Mobile Fidelity Master Golden CD is much, much, much better. Mofi is virtually the high resolution when compared with the stereo track included in this DVD-A. If needed I have a DVD-A for sale!

B004Y1USV2|5.0|FLY FROM HERE . I LOVE IT !!!! Drama . Yes without Jon Anderson. The album songs sounded great live. Andersons vocals were soarly missed on all the songs other than drama tunes . There was no replacing Jon Anderson ,city of lights, city of magic.  After seeing them live throughout the 70's , I thought my favorite band of the 70's was going the way of Led Zeppelin and the Beatles 10 years earlier. But to my grateful surprise they kept the magic alive. Yes fans know the history. Now we have Fly From Here. Anyone who remembers the Drama concert has to remember the shorter version of this song. It had been probably 30 years since I played the old cassette that Fly From Here was recorded on. I was smiles from ear to ear listening to this disc. This album is up there as one of my favorite Yes albums. By the way . Anyone who wants to here the original live version from the 80's tour can find it on the 3 cd Word Is Live discs. So much Yes history there. The versions of Fly From Here and Go Through This are on one of the discs. The same feed back that came over the radio when I dubbed the concert to cassette is still there. I would love to see and hear this album live. The DVD is great to watch before you play the disc. It tells the story of why we have FLY FROM HERE. You get to see what everyone looks like today. Very cool and well worth the money . I listened to it on the plane flying to Florida for vacation. Now that was an obvious rush. The magic is still there. I hope you can enjoy this disc as much as I do.  Dave from Cleveland area
B004XN3FHA|3.0|Overall this is a good light.  It is bright, but is a little tempermental to use.  It also does not come with any operating instructions.  You would think that it is \\"..just a flashlight..\\" and is straight-forward to use.  Not necessarily.  On/Off button sometimes has a delay of up to 10 seconds while other times it is an immediate on.  I am not always able to use the strobe when I want.  Can potentially be  problem in law enforcement.  The head of the light is a little large and the light is somewhat heavy.  I am not sending it back, but would not necessarily recommend it either.
0061537934|4.0|What a nice break from the run-of-the-mill cop books. I really enjoyed the easy read. Although i was anticipating the end of the book and preparing myself, it was to no avail.... Dog and animal lovers will view life a little differently (in a good way) after reading this book.

B0064MT1NU|2.0|Like the previous blu ray from AU a few years ago, this one too omits the essential subtitles from Ada's sign language to her daughter about her relationship and the Maori's dialogue.  It makes no sense that they missed these important parts of the film.  Unlike other criticisms, though, I think the print is actually very good.  Some of it is grainy, but this was filmed with many dark scenes and in the jungle, and I don't recall it being much different in the movie theater.  The color is great and the sound is great.
0670022705|2.0|This book exudes political correctness, ignoring the many astounding and superior objects of Western civilization in favor of such forgotten items as the \\"Hawaiian Feather Helmet\\" and the \\"Australian Bark Shield.\\" And at the end when the author allowed himself the luxury of including a modern invention or two he includes the \\"credit card\\" (a dull extension of money lending) and weirdly, the obscure \\"solar-powered lamp and charger\\", ignoring the personal computer, the cell phone, the MP3 player, and any number of paradigm shifting devices. Do not waste money on this volume, but leave it in the dusty corners of the museum whence it came.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Van Halen saved rock from the dismal disco era in the late 70's early 80's, and once again they renew my faith in rock n roll. I've been a huge fan of VH forever and this album rocks. I have to admit it, tattoo scared me a little, it didn't grab me and kick me in the butt like I had hoped, but it grew. I've digested this cd for 24 hrs now and it doesn't disappoint.  Eddie's playing and sound is better and as sharp as ever and  all the songs from top to bottom have that old school sound.  Stay frosty, while it is similar to one of my favorites, ice cream man, sounds great and is an instant favorite of my kids. My 6 year old daughter was singing it at the bus stop this afternoon.  And I have to agree with a couple other reviews, how can a so called \\"die hard Van Halen fan\\" not like this music and give it only one star? Indeed, Sammy must have a few die hard fans left that think like he does. For me personally, Van Halen will ALWAYS be Eddie and Alex. And after seeing Wolfie on the last tour and hearing him now, it appears the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. I've waited for years to hear new VH material and this is top notch. The only problem I have with this entire VH release/tour, no Ohio dates including Cleveland, the rock capital of the world!  I was pumped to take my kids, one is learning guitar, the other drums, to their first rock concert to break them in correctly and see the greatest musicians on earth. And no Cleveland date. Bummer! But hopefully we'll get to a couple shows. Until then, the family and especially myself is going to kick back and enjoy this music for a long time to come. Let's just hope it won't be another 28 years for more Van Halen music where my kids will be wheeling me into a venue to see a VH show.
B004A7UVLC|5.0|If you like edgy, eccentric, original and complex mysteries, the quality continues in this second installment of the first season of the iconic Sherlock.  Watson seems more relaxed and at home in Sherlock's company and you can see their relationship meld right before your eyes. There's a mysterious murder of a banker with graffiti spray painted on the wall--why was the banker murdered and what does the graffiti mean offers a tantalizing puzzle for Sherlock.  In these episodes a series of crimes are attempted, and Sherlock has to discern a pattern of connection in order to solve them.  His life and Watson's are usually put at risk, his apartment is invaded or damaged, and there's often an on-foot chase scene.  Oh--and he is usually rude to a number of folks but manages to put them in their place with his superior intellect and wit.  It's a thoroughly enjoyable ride and the chemistry between Sherlock and Watson is palpable--hope there's many more seasons of this delightful mystery.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so much fun and you never get bored!!! there are hundreds of apps. literally! and its easy too. not overly annoying to get more games.
B005MW8CLK|5.0|I have started becoming one of those people that are wary of buying any new remastered versions of past analog recordings. Also, newly pressed vinyl, but that's another topic. But, for any fans that are wondering if you should buy these remastered versions of both Gish and Siamese Dream, or you are just happy with your old copy, rest assured that these remasters will not disappoint. They sound much brighter, crisp and clearer than the original CDs. The DVDs and extra tracks are a real bonus  and are worth the extra money if you can swing it. I've been sitting here listening to both the original and the remastered versions back and forth and can tell you that I'm putting away the 1993 CD in favor of the 2011 version. I can not at this time comment yet on the vinyl reissues because I haven't purchase them as of yet. I do have the original presses of Gish and Siamese Dream on vinyl and always preferred the vinyl over the CD. Again, that's another topic. I do plan on getting copies in the future for sure. I've read some really negative reviews of of Nirvana's Nevermind reissue. Bu,t rest assured for those are thinking of skipping over these remasters for that reason. Every remastered CD should sound as good as these ones do.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome game!! its very entertaining!!!!!!! its great i liked playing all the games! !!!! its amazingly fun  :) there is like 119 games and i like them all!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I love this little game. very addicting family fun that we all enjoy in the car. and its free! can't beat the price.
0307949486|5.0|Just freakin awesome. totally got lost in the pages. i want lisbeth in my life. loved the message about authority taking advantage of their power and how sick it is. loved the message that just because \\"the man\\" says so, it must be right. EFF THE MAN!!!
1603420398|4.0|But that doesn't affect the contents of the book. I'm still considered a novice to crocheting(when does that title wear off?) and actually have no idea how to do a granny square, but want to make some afgans for the back of my couch, among other things ;)  Pictures are very bright, the instructions seem clear enough, and it'll be a great reason to practice reading patterns and diagrams together to produce something nice.  The only thing I don't particularly care for is the covering on the spiral binding- it makes it a bit too tight, and I already heard a small tear or two when trying to lay the book flat to look at some of the motifs in the back.  Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase, although we drove an hour to go to a craft supply store and it was on sale for 30% off there, which put that price at 8.00 versus the 16 that I paid. But if you don't have sales near you, the price isn't bad for the overal quality.
B002EDH0FE|1.0|Watchmen was chosen for being uniquely different from the standard \\"Super hero\\" formula. These characters were in fact, totally new to my eyes. (Never have read the titular graphic novel)  I did appreciate the opening title scenes, as they gave the viewer a quick primer of the Watchmen origins/mythos. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see it through. The story could not keep my attention or interest. Knowing this thing runs 2 1/2 hours, I bailed even before all the characters made it to the screen. So I can say this film was not for me. But others may love it after spending the time to actually \\"Watch\\" it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game,play it even while taking bath,game is fast and easy to learn, download and play look for some of there other games
B0019M06JS|5.0|Another wonderful album by the talented Elaine Elias.  She is a brilliant pianist, with connections to Brazil's greatest bossa nova pioneers.  I highly recommend this wonderful album!
B004AYCWY4|2.0|I found the book really annoying, even though other books by Dawkins were extremely good (especially The Blind Watchmaker). I was very disappointed by this book. Dawkins goes off on tons of self indulgent tangents and parenthetical statements that don't add anything. At times he repeated himself so many times that he was flogging a dead horse, something that I found very condescending. It does take some knowledge of biology to understand some of his arguments, and perhaps I felt that way because I am not the intended audience. Nonetheless, I didn't get much in the way of useful arguments to use when confronted by a creationist. Toward the middle of the book, I started wishing he would hurry up and end be done with it. I think the editors did a poor job, but I speculate the possibility that Dawkins simply \\"got his way\\" with things due to his generally bullish personality.
085738371X|5.0|It was very nice to be able to purchase these books as a packaged trilogy at such a good price. I only have one complaint; it took a little longer than expected to arrive. Otherwise terrific.
0307957934|1.0|Little did I expect another version of \\"HAL\\" (2001, A Space Odyssey), cramped to fit the interests/concerns about the impact of hedge funds. The plot development is formulaic, the characters undeveloped, and the ending entirely predictable.  Like the hedge funds this was written to make money....clients, readers be damned.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|This review is for the Blu-ray Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy.<br /><br />Most purchasers of this set will have already seen the films themselves and know what to expect. The first film is excellent, of course, it has the advantage of wonder and mystery that the sequals can never regain. The second film, Jurassic Park: The Lost World is good, and entertaining. People give it a pretty bad rap, but it's really not that bad. It's about the action and the excitement more than anything else. Jurassic Park III is a little better than the previous, with most of the stars from the original at least making an appearance.<br /><br />The set includes lots of extra features, with plenty of interviews and behind the scenes shorts. One thing they could have done much better, in my opinion, is get more creative with the special features. They felt a bit hum drum, and didn't really excite me like some do. Either creating games, or just arranging the menus in a more engaging way would have helped.<br /><br />If you want the set though, this is the one to get. Comes with codes to download the digital copy, but does not include DVDs.
B006G2ZEV6|3.0|its giving me an error when i try and download!!!:( what do i do Pls help and yes i have enough space and im on iver fast wifi!!!
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I mainly use this for vocals through a Motu unit into my computer.  Thus far it has worked great.  Like many others have said, this is a very solid feeling microphone. It also comes in its own nice little case, which makes it easy to move around and store safely.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell writes well. I would classify all his books as \\"readable\\" non-fiction.  Outliers challenges the conventional wisdom that there is something special about the phenomenally successful. He dilutes it down to a personal level - intelligence, hard-work (10,000 hours), and sheer luck; a community level - family; and a historical level - cultural background and the marketplace.  You will enjoy the ride, but be ready to take your critical-thinking cap off while reading as some correlations are um ... Outliers!!
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I just heard the song Video Games and thought it was intriguing. I got the album and it's all almost as good, some even better and it's always interesting. yes, she's very stylized and maybe pretentious. Her detached Veronica Lake thing may work better in small doses but really, this is a beautiful album and she's clearly a talented girl.  I think the super synthesized arrangements against an all to human voice hit just the right chord.  I do have a slight fear I may listen to this to death, get sick of it and then it's a big hit and I go insane. The same happened for me with Winehouse!
B000002UJQ|1.0|No redeeming qualities....every song sucks. Radiohead I will never buy another of your ablumns. Some of your songs are so bad I started laughing.
B005CRY2O6|3.0|I just returned the Kindle version of this cookbook. I heard about the stellar photography, and am someone who enjoys looking at pictures in a book to decide which recipe to try. There were no photos in the Kindle version.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is one of the best games I've played on my kindle fire. It is super User friendly and is easy to fit your needs. It is worth your time.
B004V5QWU2|4.0|I really enjoy this app. It is very relaxing. Three different kinds of rain, three kinds of thunderstorm for example, a vast variety of relaxing sounds. Good quality, some sounds are better than others. Wind for instance doesn't work very well. But overall it's one of the best apps I have downloaded. I fall asleep with the sound of rain. I recommend it.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|very good movie must watch for any drama fan. Acting was great and overall story line was awesome.  Good movie for the wife and husband to watch.
B006PZBR8S|1.0|I aint like no hick story about hurtin a bull. My hick radar aint likin dat sit. Seriously. Animal cruelty. Don't watch.
B003JR1USM|4.0|Not only are the band members all beautiful, but so is their music. Several of the songs on this album have YouTube videos as well: Islands of Light, Precious Dark, In Passing, Scissor-Paper-Rock, and Straight & Arrow; so go and check out their YouTube channel at \\"user/indica\\". Note that the import has a bonus track #11 \\"Outside In\\" included. Jonsu's almost-lispy accent is quite seductive and heavenly to listen to.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I absoloutly love this app! I think its so fun and great to use when you are bored or in your downtime.
0300176147|5.0|A truly wonderful way to get young children interested in history. A must read for parents and grand parents who love to read or tell bed time stories. It opened my curiosity to look for ways to explain and tell stories to my 3 year old grand daughter.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a great knife... the first thing i did was clean the egde up a little and then strop it to razor sharpness... two situations called for the knife already and the blade has held up very well... i used this knife to chop some dry lemon tree limbs for a make shift cooking fire... the wieght and blade thikness of the knife helped it chop great and the edge held very well...were talking about some really hard wood too! great knife
0920668372|5.0|I read this book to my twins when I first got it, and it was so beautiful that I actually teared up and had to hold back from crying out loud. A beautiful sentiment! A must for all mommies!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its free so its not bad for free. you get a lot of hours of entertainment out of it for nothing so why not try it?
B000E41MS6|5.0|very interesting the best episode has got to be dalek christerther ecclston isnt the best doctor but hes ok i recon its worth a buy
B002IKLZZY|5.0|That the movie is great goes without saying. The extras are really interesting and informative as well, with background on both Hitchcock and Grant.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Sometimes when I am so floored by something so remarkable, I find it difficult to move on to the next thing - no matter how enticing.  For example, how do you move onto the second course of a five star meal when it feels like nothing could top the first. The book thief is such an experience. The story is so compelling; the characters- unforgettable; the imagery- so powerful.  Its hard to imagine this being read by a  young adult, but if it is, I hope there is an adult nearby to pick up the pieces.  Beautiful. Many thanks to the author for putting this work of art on &#34;paper.&#34;  As I write this review clumsily on my Kindle I am reminded why I love to hold an actual book in my hands.
0756686970|4.0|This was a good purchase. All the lego sets are updated through 2011. You will receive a Han Solo from the end of  Episode IV: A New Hope in the throne room and with medal around his neck.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is actually pretty fun. it plays well and the games are challenging but fun. all in all a pretty fun one.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Slammed  \\"Wow\\"...\\"Yeah, Wow\\" I do not know what I was expecting this book to be about when I began to read it, but I knew it was written by an author from my neck of the woods which intrigued me. As I began to read, I fell hard for the characters in the story and the struggles they were going through. In the midst of all of life's craziness, love can be found. Definitely recommend this.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I just purchased this mic to be used with my Tascam DR-07MKII. I've been wanting to get better audio when recording youtube videos so I decided give this Lav a try.  First off I was prepared to deal with the fact that the Lav is mono.  However, I must have a newer updated version because mine actually has a stereo plug on it! It records on the left and right channels! A little confused but I'm not complaining. As for the sound quality, it is amazing. Everything sounds clean. I've heard some people complain about hissing when used with DSLR's but many of them have an automatic gain and when the signal is highly amplified so is the hiss. I can say using this as the external mic on the Tascam DR-07MKII I have not experienced any excess hiss at all. This has definitely been a worthwhile purchase and the price was just right!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The mini games are entertaining for when you have those few extra moments when you just want to pass the time.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Of course,  I had to suppress my logic while watching this in order to enjoy it completely. I mean there are quite a few illogical moments but they do not affect the entertaining value of this movie. The special effects are much superior to others of the same genre. They look real, spectacular and scary. There are some scenes with depth and emotion too. For example, the scenes where the rich paid billion of dollars to be hauled to safety while the poor were left behind.<br /><br />In short, it's the FATHER of all disaster movies so far in terms of special effects and entertaining.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Best thing about it works with everything I use, from my work Windows laptop to my MacBook Air to my iPhone to my Kindle Fire. My notes are with me no matter what device I have with me. It has been 100% reliable and stable on every device.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finally after much convincing jumped on the \\"Hunger Games\\" bandwagon. I am not usually a fan of fantasy or futuristic type books.  This one, however, had a good mix of common day and future without being overwhelming.  The storyline had me hanging on every page, never a dual moment or a place where I was hoping things would speed up. The tempo and pace were perfect.  I stayed up till 3am to finish reading. It was worth it! I can't wait to read the next two books! I'm a fan!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|this is ad free make sure you install after you install this version or you're going to be playing the ad version of the game.
0439023491|5.0|Please forgive the Star Wars reference but a major character does get captured at the end.  Lots of people die.  Cities get torched and our heroes get put in a giant death trap.  All innocence gets lost in this book as if it was not crushed enough in book 1.  I loved this book because yet again it was a real Sci Fi Dystopia with all the dust, blood and sickness you could ever want but might not expect from a YA book.  If this book does not make you run for the third, you need to read it again.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|I knew nothing about this movie before renting it other than watching the trailer on the Amazon website.  I was expecting an action movie, with lots of car chases and minimal acting.  The opening sequence proved that I was half right.  The car chase was there, but the acting was minimal in word count only.  Each actor's words were carefully chosen, and the majority of communication was conveyed by body language and facial expression alone.  The only weak link in the acting was Ron Perlman, but his character was probably written to be cartoonish in portrayal.  The movie moves along slowly but not too slowly, and the inaction contributes to the suspense. The cinematography is wonderful, watch this on a big screen if you can. I won't give you any spoilers because you should stop reading reviews and watch this movie now!
0439023483|5.0|When I first picked up this book I thought it would be like a YA Running Man which would have been amazing if it was just that.  It was better because it was very different and a full rich world.  I loved that it was smart as well as an emotion hammer to the chest.  It felt very real which is hard to do in Sci Fi alone but in YA Sci Fi this stuff is very very rare.  It's not safe.  It's not predictable.  You might not like everyone but you will get were they are coming from and I hope you loved this book as much as I did.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This is truly an enjoyable album. If you are a Paul McCartney fan that also loves jazz then you will like this album. I was a McCartney fan first long ago and became a jazz fan in the 90's. I see now that I've always liked the McCartney songs that had a jazz quality to it. Those so-called McCartney fans that don't like this album either hate jazz or aren't really McCartney fans. I think it's wonderful that McCartney finally put out an album like this. There's not a bad song on this album. The two McCartney originals are instant classics. A very enjoyable album.
0439023513|5.0|I no some people did not like this book like the others but you really need to understand that (spoiler) if you take a 17 year old, Make her play the most dangerous game twice with loved ones, blow up her sister, torch her town, have her 100% loose her faith in the government and an the end leave her crippled, addicted to drugs with a guy she loves and who loves her but with similar problems they might not fall into each others arms with the kind of rainbow and unicorn love that we all want for them.  They are two destroyed people.  Forever scarred.  My father was CIA in Korea and Vietnam and he did not come back so good.  I was glad to see Katniss and Peeta come back home like my dad did.  It's sad, It's horrible, It's war.  This was a beautiful book.
B005OP71GC|5.0|I haven't watched a major network show in ages - in fact, I got rid of TV entirely over two years ago, and now only watch Netflix and on-demand video.<br /><br />I stumbled on \\"Revenge,\\" bought the pilot, and got hooked - came back and bought the rest.<br /><br />NOTE: For the two village idiots who gave this one star because it's not on DVD...hello -- it's still in its first season, and still airing.  Of course it's not on DVD yet.<br /><br />There's no great plot description in the existing reviews, so here's my attempt to be succinct yet clear without any spoilers.<br /><br />The main character, Amanda Clarke (played by Emily VanCamp) returns to her childhood home in the Hamptons -- under an assumed identity, Emily Thorne -- to systematically exact revenge on every individual who was involved in framing her father for a capital crime he didn't commit.  At the center of the deceit is the Grayson family, with Madeleine Stowe as the sexy yet formidable matriarch Victoria.  At the \\"heart\\" of it, there are two love interests in Emily's life: Jack Porter, the boy who never forgot her (played by Nick Wechsler) and Victoria's son Daniel (played by Joshua Bowman) who is the apple of his mother's eye.  And there's the scheming sidekick, Nolan Ross (played by Gabriel Mann) who has deep ties to her father.  Treachery runs as deep as the secrets, love and sex are endlessly complicated, interesting new characters and plotlines are frequently introduced, and the surprises abound --- so odds are you'll get sucked into the maelstrom and become a happy addict.<br /><br />I think the show might be a bit confusing -- or at least would be far less enjoyable -- if you tune in mid-season.  There really are a lot of plot twists and turns and reveals, so I'd recommend watching the show from the beginning for maximum enjoyment.<br /><br />(And yes, the premise of the show is very loosely based on Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo -- with a gender twist/female lead.)  Enjoy!
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|When I got this app, it worked great on my phone (Motorola Atrix).  Since then I got a tablet (Motorola Xoom FE) and if I am working with an existing file, I can save changes.  But, it will not create a new file.<br /><br />Would have given it 5 stars if I had only used it on the phone because it handles some things better than similar programs.  Since the app is crippled on the tablet, I have given it only 3 stars.
1401207529|5.0|Yes, I was one of those people that had put off reading Frank Miller's reboot until recently-and I can't believe I waited this long. He sets up a good story of how a young Bruce Wayne became Batman, and also sets up the character of Jim Gordon. One of the must read graphic novels in the Batman canon.
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|I purchased this when I bought the Saitek Yoke to have a extra throttle.  It's worked out pretty well.  If there was anything I was going to knock on this product is that the mode setting on the yoke has no effect on the buttons.  So you can only program the buttons for six functions unlike the throttle that comes with the yoke where you can assign up to 18 with the three mode settings.  Would have been nice to be able to have some extra assignments, but it's not enough of a disappointment to take off a star as I believe it is intended to be an independent controller unlike the one that comes with the yoke which is designed to integrate with the yoke as the connectors are different.  This has the standard USB plug while the one that comes with the yoke has what I'd call a PS/2 plug.<br /><br />But beware; it does enhance your sim experience enough that you're going to want to buy the other add devices that they make.  I've already got my eye on a couple of them. ;-)<br /><br />Make sure to buy the power brick for the USB hub if you have the yoke to make sure you have enough power to drive the hub and the devices plugged into it.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|It has mild language.Me and my family love it.If we had to chose a movie this is it. Ferris Bueller's Day Off 1000+
B004UID2LC|4.0|this app is great if you want to download decent quality music and not have to pay. granted the quality of the sound isn't as good as it would be if you bought the songs, but i still love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game and it teaches real responsibility. I take care of my fishies everyday. I enjoy it a lot.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|After 9 years Clint Eastward returned to a familiar setting.  A classic western. Eastwood plays the character of \\"Peacher,\\" a man of the cloth who deals out lead as well as Bible verses. Lots of action and the usual high body  count.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app has a lot of challenging but fun games for all ages I play these games all the time
3442217784|2.0|Pros: It encouraged me to do something about my finances and to take risks. It gave me some starting pointers on how to make money work for me.  Cons: The authors are so condescending to their audience. They also make ridiculous claims like the times they say people are poor because they have bad spending habits - you know, instead of being born into the wrong country/city/neighborhood/race. They advocate potentially illegal behavior.
B0052U59F4|4.0|\\"The only man I've ever been attracted to, and he comes with a bloody contract, a flogger and a whole world of issues.\\"<br /><br />That quote just about sums up the problems that heroine Anastasia Steele is up against in FIFTY SHADES OF GREY. Ana is a sexually innocent 21-year-old on the verge of college graduation when she meets drop-dead sexy, 27-year-old multimillionaire business tycoon, Christian Grey. Christian becomes immediately fascinated by Ana, and begins to pursue her, even though he continuously warns that he's all wrong for her. As Ana succumbs to the powerhouse that is Christian Grey, it doesn't take her long to realize that no man, no matter how unbelievably hot he is, is perfect--and Christian is far from it.<br /><br />While Christian is a dominant in the business world, he's actually a \\"Dom\\" in the bedroom, and proposes a contract based D/s relationship with Ana. Although Christian has had a string of these relationships (15 to be exact) before meeting Ana, he begins to make it clear to her through many avenues that she affects him in a new and different way than any other woman he has ever been involved with. Over the course of Fifty Shades of Grey, Ana begins to chip away at the hard, complicated outer shell of Christian, forcing him to admit things he's never told anyone, and causing him to break many of his own rules in the process.<br /><br />Having had an incredibly disturbing and traumatizing start to life before he was adopted at the age of four, a subject he only barely broaches with Ana, Christian carries an unbelievable amount of emotional baggage that affects how he is in his intimate relationships.<br /><br />Although Christian has many issues stemming from emotional trauma as a child, and doesn't really know how to have a \\"normal\\" or what he calls a \\"vanilla\\" relationship,<br /><br />While Christian does some questionable things, is extremely controlling, and has a raging temper he doesn't seem to know how to contain at times, I was constantly left with the feeling that under all of his baggage, he's a truly decent man in so many ways. He and Ana butt heads throughout the story as he lavishes her with expensive gifts that she has an incredibly hard time accepting. In fact, his generosity is probably one of the biggest thorns in their relationship with her not wanting to take advantage of his wealth, and him not understanding why she can't accept what he can so obviously afford to buy her. He tends to be overprotective, and jealous, but even the way he comes across in those situations seem to stem from an honest place of deep caring. Being that \\"caring\\" is a word not previously in Christian's vocabulary, he spends a good amount of the story coming to terms with feelings he's never had for any other woman when it comes to Ana.<br /><br />Over the course of the book, the two exchange many emails. While the idea of two characters exchanging emails or texts throughout a story seems like an easy way to just fill page space, it was one of the things that made this story really enjoyable for me. Ana and Christian use email to open up to one another, something both have trouble doing early on; especially Ana. And the emails in this situation seem to force them to be honest to each other in their face to face conversations as well.<br /><br />The emails were also a way to see another side of Christian, a playful, flirty side that you don't always get to see on page when he's with Ana in person.<br /><br />Although this book starts out making you think it will be heavy on the D/s, as Christian is an intense Dom, looking to start a D/s relationship with Ana, it is actually very mild in that aspect, and really not what the focus of the story ends up being about.<br /><br />There are a couple minor issues I feel I should address. One is that Christian has such a dominant voice and presence in the story, that he seems far older than his given age of 27, not that a 27-year-old man can't be that dominant and sexy, it just took more effort for me to picture it. And there are a handful of over used phrases that became a bit overdone and a few British terms and phrases that just didn't fit with the \\"American\\" setting (the author is British).<br /><br />I've read many differing reviews about this book and it seems people either love it or hate it because of the way it's written or the fact that the author originally published it as a Fan Fiction story, etc. But any issues I had were overlooked easily enough thanks to a plot that, whether realistic to some or not, kept my interest from page to page so much that I literally couldn't put my Kindle down or stop thinking about the story when I wasn't reading, and I think I credit that to the character of Christian. He's such an intense presence in every single scene, that I fell head over heels with him and all of his baggage. I wanted to slap him at times and hug him at others...a feeling Ana is constantly faced with throughout the story.<br /><br />The end of this story was so intense and angsty (a major PLUS for me because I LOVE angst) that I was in tears by the end. Just a warning, however, I would have been extremely angry at the ridiculous cliffhanger if I didn't have the second book already waiting for me to read. So I suggest having book 2, FIFTY SHADES DARKER already in your possession before finishing book this book.<br /><br />Even though I say this story ends up being less about D/s than I had originally thought it would be, FIFTY SHADES OF GREY does contain a few scenes that the lighthearted might not enjoy, but overall, if you're a fan of say, Maya Banks' Sweet series, you should have no problem with this story. I could easily see myself reading it again or at least browsing through my many pages of bookmarks!<br /><br />I gave FIFTY SHADES OF GREY 4.5 Stars and 4 panties on the blog.ases that became a bit overdone and a few British terms and phrases that just didn't fit with the \\"American\\" setting (the author is British).

0307352145|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, and some of the many insights it provided. At times the book gets a big technical, but I thought the overall information would be useful to an introvert trying to understand themselves a little bit better, and also to those who work and live with introverts.
B000KITQK2|5.0|I have a soprano [[ASIN:B0002Q222G Applause by Ovation UA20-5E Ukulele]] which sounds a little muffled played only acoustically, but harsh when amplified without a pre-amp and has a troublesome C string that is rather louder than the rest. So I thought I'd give this a go... What can I say? It does exactly what the description says -- added warmth to the sound and the sweepable mid made short work of dialling down the troublesome string. In addition it's sturdily built and a more attractive burgundy-brown colour in real life, unlike the bright burgundy in the photo.  I'm sure there are better and more expensive units out there, but at this price point you can't go wrong. Even after paying almost as much in shipping as the unit is worth it was still a good buy.
0446547654|5.0|I think that this book was definitely worth reading.  I was interested in the characters lives because the author gave very good descriptions of them.  I felt as if I could see them while reading the book and actually felt happy and sad at times.  I read this book in just a few days and couldn't put it down.  Nicholas Spark's has a lot of great books but this one, so far has been my favorite.  It is a love story between two high school lovers from very different families.  The relationship was frowned upon so when they graduated the girl, Amanda, went off to college leaving her boyfriend, Dawson, alone.  They live completely different lives for years until one day the death of a mutual friend brings them back together, where they fall in love again.  It is a pretty normal love story but this one was different because the two characters didn't end up together in the end.  You thought you could guess the ending but then the author surprises you. The ending was very good though.  The author uses a lot of literary devices that catch your attention and make the reading more interesting.  For example, when he states: \\"Four years later, after a crane on the platform collapsed, a piece of flying metal debris the size of a basketball nearly took off his head.\\" (pg.1)  When the author uses this metaphor you can really picture the scene in your head.  Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good love story.

B006T5FDLG|4.0|They're exactly that. Leftovers. I mean, for 5 bucks and you're a Metallica fan, check it out. I'm not massively impressed, but I do like Metallica - and it's no Lulu. Ha Ha ! Right ? And I'm sure they could've blended these songs into Death Magnetic and it would've worked. The first track has some \\"Fuel\\" in there. The second track reminded me a bit like Slayer's Postmortem with a Master of Puppets mid-slow section. The 3rd track reminded me of Whiskey in a Jar (reminded me) , but it's the 4th track that rips. They could've made a single from the 4th track and release it as a Maxi-cd with the other 3 as b-sides and that would've seemed more acceptable. But like I said - 5 bucks and you like Metallica. Check it out. All in all : B- .

B006UG90RM|5.0|1st impressions 1) DLR isn't embarrassing (a feet unto-itself) 2) Nice to hear double bass drum 3) Eddie is obviously sober and knocked the dust off his chops (or he sees it somewhat of a competition with Sammy / Satriani) 4) It's actually a bit heavier than I expected (which means it is more the 1st 5 old VH albums than anything Eddie has written since)5) Eddie's guitar tone is the closest to that old classic \\"brown sound\\" since he fried his old gear 6) I actually thought Eddie was using some sort of effect pedal but no, his son is that good on bass (as much as it pains me to say Mike)and doubles the guitar part at times on some very technical parts / fills 7) The worst song on the album is the single they released which is a compliment (don't let that stop you from buying it!!!) 8) Some songs actually capture a bit of that fun loving / humor that was a staple of the old VH (considering these guys no longer live in that \\"carefree fun life\\" fantasy land they did as kids this is another big surprise) 9) Buy the whole album (not piece meal) put it on the stereo LOUD and enjoy...I like (more than I expected)
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|If I was describe this movie to you I would be doing you a dis service.  Let me just say that the storyline itself is a great concept.  The fighting robots are superb and it's just a really great movie.  I was laughing and clapping throughout most of the movie.  It's for everybody and you feel really satisfied when the movie is over.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Amazing imagery and use of language. Skilled writer and super imaginative storyline. I felt like I was there.  I'm excited to see this one on the big screen!
B0024F08UG|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I could not help but imagine what the people who perished in the twin towers and their families and friends must have gone through and for many are still going through. I include the thousands that died and are dying from the chemical fallout.  Watching this movie that was made decades earlier was sobering.  I saw this movie when it first came out as did millions of others.  I remember then saying to myself that this could really happen and, thus, always equated this movie with World Trade Center. It was this movie, in fact, that made me loose any love of structures that tall.  I have never mourned the lose of the World Trade Center Buildings, instead, I still mourn the lose of three thousand People.  Though the circumstances that led to the fire in the movie are quite different then the actual events that caused the twin towers to go down, the problem with large, mostly closed in glassed structured buildings is a reality. I can quite understand why, for a long time after the WTC attack, this movie was unavailable.  I am glad, however, that it is available now.  We must never forget. We must always be vigilante regarding building codes, safety, fire prevention, fire drills, etc.  The movie holds up very well after all these years. I watched it as intently as I did the first time.  The cast was an all star one for that day and time.  The story was compelling and I did not get bored for one second.  I can easily recommend this movie with the caveat that now, we unfortunately have lived through a real disaster.

B006UG90RM|1.0|I can't believe all the good reviews this album is getting. Am I missing something? The songs are just bad. The lyrics are way to complicated and the guitar playing is way over done. Dave still has most of his voice but you need some good lyrics. Everyone knows Eddie can still play but you don't have to show it on every riff and every part of the song. Don't waste your money on this one.
B00004W510|5.0|When this album came out, KRLA in Pasadena, CA were playing the single during the day, and album tracks at night.  My buddy Dave got a copy of the album and we listened to it on a sleepover.  I went out and bought it with my allowance that next Friday night and it remains a treasure.  I knew nothing about them backing Dylan or their previous incarnation as the Hawks, but i was hooked!  Sadly, 2 of the 5 are no longer with us and there is animosity amidst the survivors.  But back in the day, they surely were, and always will be The Band!

B001B93QSW|5.0|I have owned a copy of \\"Too Fast For Love\\" since 1983, when I was introduced to the Crue thru the fantastic \\"Shout at the Devil\\" LP. My personal favorite has always been \\"Live Wire\\" in part because of the rad video on MTV back in the day. For every hard rock fan of the period Motley Crue were seminal and required listening. They were Van Halen w/out the trendiness and slickness. The Crue were scumbags in real life as on record: abusing girls; getting wasted; destroying cars; setting themselves on fire on purpose; etc. You name it, the Crue did it and probably ended up besting even Keith Moon at being rock stars in the final generation before political correctness hit.<br /><br />One of the most rad things about the production of this album is Tommy Lee's raw drum sound w/out any of the '80s processing and chorus that dominated drums in that era. You can imagine Lee sitting across the living room from you, playing drums, while you sit back and slam a few dozen cold beers.<br /><br />What really pushes this sleazefest over the top, however, is the inclusion of \\"Toast of the Town\\" and \\"Stick to Your Guns,\\" which were released as a Leathur 7 inch in 1981, about a year before \\"Too Fast for Love\\" came out.<br /><br />If you want to remember what it was like being 12 years old and going to the swap meet and picking up the skull tee shirt with the handcuffs thru the eyes (for the old Crue fans like me) than pick up this ass kicking masterpiece of black leather.
B00012FXAE|5.0|I personally think the second Alien movie, Aliens (this one), was superior to the first movie, Alien, in many ways: it had more action, more danger and suspense, more aliens, more violence, more jerks, and more reason to watch over and over again. Personally, I think James Cameron is a better director than Ridley Scott: his style is excellent, portraying the action in a very active and up-close manner while being creative. The scary quiet scenes? Awesome. The special effects and aliens are also better-looking than the first movie, but it's still not top notch. But who cares? Everything about the movie was awesome!<br />No wonder why Rotten Tomatoes gave it 100/100.<br />I would definitely recommend buying this movie. If you think that old movies stink because their special effects are bad and/or because they're just old news, watch this. It's also not ridiculously gory. It's hardly gory at all. Just scary and action-packed. So don't consider it some freakish 80s sci-fi flick.

0439023513|2.0|******** Massive spoilers alert *********  I loved the Hunger Games and Catching Fire so much that I talked and thought about them constantly.  Absolutely amazing, riveting pieces of fiction.  This conclusion disappointed in so many ways I don't know where to begin.  It's almost as if the author decided \\"let's take the things that people liked from the first book and reduce that by 90%, and take the stuff people didn't like and amplify it by 10x.  I have no trouble with not having an \\"everybody lives and is happy ending\\".  Such an ending would have been a huge unrealistic cheat and I would have railed against that too.  It wasn't the last few pages that bothered me, it was the last 200 pages.  So flawed...  The war is all encompassing but feels so disjointed.  She's out, she's in, she's moody, they don't want her, they do want her, some want her, some don't, she participates, she doesn't, oh my God it just gets mind numbing.  And you have no good sense of the overall picture - as another reviewer pointed out that's a weakness of the first person point of view but there's no reason you can't fill in the blanks while she's unconscious in the hospital over and over.  In the end, my biggest beef is the way Katniss just sort of happens through everything with so little meaning behind it or anything that she does.  She doesn't connect with the war movement, yet goes along with it.  It's not tragic, it's boring.  She doesn't evolve, doesn't mature, stuff just happens around her with her not really even being responsible for any of it.  People die and disappear from the story without any feeling of loss somehow.  Do Finnick and Prim's deaths not deserve at least a fraction of the gravitas that Rue's did in the first book???  Some things just don't make sense, and I agree seemed like they were rushed.  After all that happens, her mom is working in a hospital never calls?  Haymitch becomes a hermit again?  Gale \\"gets a job\\"???  Peeta just \\"shows up\\" at the end, and it's barely a big deal.  Peeta and Gale just seem to appear and disappear at random, with no good reason for it half the time.  She kills Coin and a trial we don't get to see declares her innocent?  Huh?  By who?  And she just moves back to 12 to be taken care of by Greasy Sae?  I can think of 20 ways the execution/trial/fallout could have been done better than this.  The story needed a moving ending and instead it ends with a shrug.  Far too much of the story has to do with the war and not the people in it.  The first too books were all about the human stories, even when the Games were going on.  This war was not, and that's the real difference IMHO, and the main reason that this book just doesn't work.  I understand the point she's trying to make of how war is destructive on so many levels.  But this book doesn't make you feel the war, it just makes you feel Katniss' mind-numbing heartbreak/depression/numbness/injuries and it's so tedious.  Only once, when she starts training, do we get a TINY flash of the \\"wow she's going to do something big\\" because she cares again.  But then she just limps from scene to scene and we can care so little about what's going on.  She's a very flawed character I know, but here there's just no redeeming features to her at all.  No \\"aha\\" moments, very few flashes of brilliance.  Way too many injuries, hospitalizations, etc.  And too many times where she could resolve some things with dialogue but just goes silent.  So frustrating...  In the first two books the quiet, reflective parts add to the drama and flesh out the story.  Here they somehow take away from it - the self-loathing, depressive bits are laid on way to frequently, and are exacerbated by the fact that Peeta and Gale just distance themselves from her too.  She kills the president, and we're forced 15 pages on her wallowing in miserly not knowing what's going on - a device used waaaay to often by the author in this book.  She didn't really do anything to accomplish any of her goals.She didn't save Peeta - (others did, in a scene that we were cheated of because guess what?  She was comatose in the hospital AGAIN.  This rescue should have been given to us some way.  And at first you question why he was not rescued sooner, or eventually why did they bother at all).  She didn't get any revenge on Snow (his death is an afterthought and should have been delivered with some satisfaction. Instead he gets the last word).  I could go on and on but there's no point.  This book pales in comparison to the first two and I'm really disappointed after loving the first two so much.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I ordered the Pink Kidle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware and after reading the reviews I wasn't expecting much, but I was shocked, it looks very sophisticated, and the color isn't obnoxious.

B00003CXDD|4.0|While I love 80s films, I'm embarrassed to say I never saw Willow until recently. The idea to use Warwick Davis as the star hero and the whole race of \\"little people\\" was inspired. It adds a flair of fantasy to the film that wouldn't have been possible otherwise before computer-generated graphics (even in the Lord of the Rings getting the Hobbits small required a lot of tricks). Davis himself was a superb actor; even though he was only 17 at the time he conveys a mix of weariness and care that propels him on the adventure.<br /><br />That said, unlike some films from the era, Willow has aged. The special effects for this movie are a bit dated, particularly in the creatures department (the two-headed beast's jaws look plastic). There are also a few corny moments that passed muster in the 1980s but seem odd today (particularly the romance scenes!). The villains are pretty forgettable as well.<br /><br />Still, these are part of the package with 1980s movies, the charm and the corny effects. Overall, Willow has far more charm than corn. It is definitely an 80s fantasy film classic and still probably one of the better non-franchise fantasy films out there (i.e., excluding Lord of the Rings and Narnia).<br /><br />UPDATE (March 16, 2013): I watched the blu-ray version and it looks a lot better. The special effects don't look nearly so dated. They're old, but they don't stick out. I think the rest of my review still holds up. It's a fun movie and the heroes are great, but the villains are mediocre. The first third of the film is a wonderful exercise in world-building but the last half I think tries to tell too much too quickly. Still, definitely recommended for fantasy fans.

078322611X|5.0|\\"If you build it...he will come.\\"<br /><br />With those seven words, eerily whispered by an apparition in the ear of Iowa corn farmer Ray Kinsella, a film classic was born. Heck, classic may not be a strong enough word to describe \\"Field of Dreams\\". \\"Masterpiece\\" may be more fitting.<br /><br />It is a film that has it's foundation built on evening catches with dad and laid-back saturday afternoons, eating hot dogs at the ballpark, and watching your favorite player field a ball or take the mound or step into the batters box to belt a home run - hopefully in your direction. It's a film deep-rooted in the nostalgia that surrounds the game and it's rich history and harkens back to a simpler, more innocent time, when baseball was played for the love of the game. Unlike the steroid-laden and greed-driven abomination that the game has become today, baseball used to be something that was more than a game to the people of America. It was our life blood, a living, breathing embodiment of the American spirit. Somehow, that has gotten lost, but the root values are still there, somewhere, under all the muck and filth that the current version of the game has heaped upon it. That is what this film is about.<br /><br />This isn't simply just another \\"baseball\\" or \\"sports\\" film. It is a movie about characters and relationships. Not just the central figures of Ray Kinsella and \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson, but of Rays patient and understanding wife Annie, their daughter Karen, Ray's father John, the embittered former writer and civil rights activist Terrence Mann (brilliantly portrayed by James Earl Jones), Annie's brother Mark, who plays the role of antagonist of this film, as well as Archie \\"Moonlight\\" Graham, the former ball player turned small town doctor who never got his shot to show what he could do, touchingly protrayed by film legend Burt Lancaster in one of his final roles.<br /><br />\\"Field of Dreams\\" is a movie that is sentimental; a poingnant, Norman Rockwell-esque painting of Americana set to celluloid. It is a movie of regret and retribution, a celebration of life and love that tugs at your heartstrings while simultaneously lifting your spirits. From the beautiful cinematography to the endearing and memorable soundtrack , the film is a gem, and is the best of the best in terms of baseball films (and sports films in general) and is an essential film on my top 50 list of all-time movies.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I am a fan of this series. As a matter of fact, before purchasing this latest work, I re-read the entire series to get me back into the mood of the storyline. I have some points for those who find it 'boring' or 'stumbling' or 'too much'.<br /><br />First - GRRM has NOT changed his style. He continues to grip you with an amazing tale, granted a very long tale, that has the most amazing and in-depth character development I have ever seen. If you go back and re-read the series, you will find this DOES NOT CHANGE over the course of the story. What happens is that new characters are introduced and the tale becomes more complex.<br /><br />Second - If you don't want to read what is essentially and in-depth and amazingly colorful history, then don't! Sure, this is entertainment, yet it TRULY makes you think! The author is forcing you to remember and figure out that these characters are all acting independently along the timeline. The depth of the story (stories really) is truly awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Third - GRRM is bold enough to piss off the reader by simply making things happen. Characters die! Characters you LIKE DIE! BAD things happen that you DON'T want to happen. TOUGH! It's all a part of the story! IF you don't like that - then write your own story where everything happens exactly the way YOU want it to! I cannot even count the number of times I have said to myself \\"I never saw that coming!\\" This all feeds back into my first point! The Character development is amazing! In reality people change as they grow and experience life - these characters change in the same manner! It's truly gripping!<br /><br />Fourth - No, I don't find this to be a 'can't put it down page-turner' yet I found myself reading it every day. the story is gripping, the characters are amazingly human and honestly believable. They do things you don't expect, not because the author wants to piss you off, because they are very like real people!<br /><br />In the end, I find this series to be stunningly good. Continually. The biggest problem I have is I wish it would wrap up - I think a lot of us feel that way. Yet I will continue to read as we (hopefully) get another installment.<br /><br />The story did move along, many seem to feel it didn't move along enough for them, again, I say, let the art flow. If you don't like it, stop reading it. The end of the book very much sets us up for the next one and completely changes the game - again! Sometimes I think he does this just to be annoying.<br /><br />Hope that helps.....nningly good. Continually.

B005MIYI3K|5.0|I've always loved Nightwish's music, which blends rich and passionate classical styles with heavy metal. I just never like Tarja - a wannabe opera singer.  Then they got Anette and they became my favorite orchestral metal band. And since her first album with them, she has improved her technique. She sings with more energy and emotion that compliments the music even more now.  Their energy is contagious. I feel inspired listening to this new album, Imaginaerum.

1439152780|4.0|This is a haunting tale of three sisters and their life in the English country side during WWII. From the beginning I could see that the book was beautifully written. I had one problem with it about half way through where I wanted to give it up though because I felt the story was moving too slowly for me, but I stuck with it and I'm glad I did because after that I could not put the book down
B004FOA84A|4.0|I love the game. Puzzles are fun. I did get stuck with the tree trunk section. The ending was ok just too short for the price. I got it as FAOTD so its nice.

B006E4QCXU|4.0|Its not bad. I could just go on and keep tuching the screen to see the different colors and shape. Its a waste of time really but very interesting.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Holy cow. This album is amazing. Not a bad song in the lot. The weakest are \\"Tattoo\\" and \\"She's the Woman\\", and those aren't bad. Excellent tunes include \\"You and Your Blues\\" (should be the next single), \\"China Town\\", \\"Blood and Fire\\", \\"Bullethead\\", \\"As Is\\", \\"Stay Frosty\\", and \\"Beats Workin'\\".  But really, all of the tunes I didn't mention are excellent too. The songs have great chord progressions and melodies, clever lyrics from Dave (sorry Sammy, but Roth was always a better lyricist), and the playing, well, let me put it this way: elephant balls from hell. Most of the tracks are very uptempo with great drumming from Alex, very good debut performance from Wolfie on bass, and Eddie's just on fire. And anyone who says Roth has lost something over time is just crazy. This is the best he's ever sounded on a Van Halen album. In the old days they'd play it safe with his voice and keep him in the mid range, but on ADKOT he's allowed to stretch out a bit more, even singing notes you'd normally hear from Sammy, and he pulls it off admirably.  If you're a Van Halen fan you need to buy this album, it's a classic that fits in just fine along side the original 6 albums they did with DLR. And the rest of their catalog for that matter.

B0018QQQK8|3.0|I always like to start my reviews by giving a little bit about myself away. I'm a 17 year old male high school student who reads voraciously. I constantly vary my tastes from horror to mystery to literature to romance. I've never read Nicholas Sparks before, but I saw the movie [[ASIN:B000683VI4 The Notebook]] and literally balled my eyes out. So, I'm not exactly the target audience for Sparks' work, but I still felt like I should check it out.<br /><br />\\"The Lucky One\\" is about Logan Thibault, a US Marine who travels across the country in search of a mysterious woman in a photograph he believes to have been his lucky charm during his service in Iraq. There are a few twists and turns, but overall it's a straightforward tale and plays out pretty decently.<br /><br />And I think that's really the main flaw of this book: everything is just \\"decent\\" and \\"mediocre\\". It gets the job done. There's no risks, no shining prose, no super emotional stuff that really bonds you to the characters. Most things are taken at surface level. This isn't a bad thing if it's what you're looking for in a book. But this is not a deep, passionate, love story either.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks isn't a wordsmith poet. He uses blessedly simple prose that tells the story fast and effectively. The only problem is, he's catering to an audience... or more likely what he thinks of an audience. Many subjects are broached upon by all of our three narrators, multiple times, one after the other. For example, when Protagonist A gets worried about their kid because Protagonist B is being a jerk and Protagonist C doesn't like it, we get to see and hear about it three times, from all three directions. This mildly interesting device very quickly wears thin and becomes tedious as the book goes on.<br /><br />The structure of the story also leaves a lot to be desired. It's starts out strong, the forward action only briefly interrupted by some expository flashbacks. But then, those flashbacks don't really stop... ever. Every time something interesting occurs in the present, Logan will need to relate it back to his days in the Marines, or his fishing trip with his friend, Vinny. This screws pacing up, a lot. So, then, by the middle of the book, when all of the plot threads start getting laid out, the exposition hasn't finished yet, and the middle really drags on. Luckily, everything picks up for the last 1/4 of the book, when real danger strikes and people start to actually do things.<br /><br />But the ending isn't perfect. By no means. It will satisfy even the most skeptical reader, because it wraps many things up in one swift move. But, at times, the climax does seem a little Soap Opera-ey, with characters responding to rumors and predictable, but still exciting developments playing out. Also, the Epilogue uses a cheap trick to make the reader feel any emotion at all. Tsk. Tsk.<br /><br />The characters in this book are probably its one flaw, with, of course, the delightful exception of Nana. Logan, Keith, and Ben are all basically one-trick ponies. They don't ever go too far into the land of archetypes, but they never evolve past cardboard static characters. Beth is a decent character, but not because she actually *does* much, more just because she has some active opinions and sometimes acts on them. The best character is Nana, who sounds the most human out of all of them and adds some much needed humor to this bland mixture.<br /><br />In conclusion, this was my first Nicholas Sparks novel, and it will be my last for a long time. I don't want to give up on him entirely, but I think my tastes are better suited elsewhere, at least for the time being. Maybe in a year or two, I'll pick up [[ASIN:0446605239 The Notebook]] or one of his newer novels, and give him another shot. For now, I'll stick to my other favorites.<br /><br />I Recommend this book to anyone who:<br />- Is from the South, specifically the Carolinas<br />- Loves Dogs<br />- Likes the classic idea of \\"family\\"<br />- Is happy when justice gets served to the bad guys<br />- Likes realistic dramaily\\"<br />- Is happy when justice gets served to the bad guys<br />- Likes realistic drama

0307352145|5.0|\\"Don't hire introverts!\\" the workshop leader said to a group of travel agents at a conference I attended in 2002.  He was giving advice on how to run a successful agency.  \\"Oh great,\\" I thought.  I had just left a 21 year career as a very introverted software engineer to enter the field of travel.  The prospects of me succeeding in this new venture seemed slim as I am by nature a quiet person.  I wish back then I had Susan Cain's excellent new book \\"Quiet: The Power Of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\\".  While that workshop leader and many others may think this is an extrovert oriented World, the number of introverts could surprise you.  \\"Depending on which study you consult, one third to one half of Americans are introverts--in other words, one out of every two or three people you know,\\" Cain writes. \\"If you're not an introvert yourself, you are surely raising, managing, married to, or coupled with one.\\"  \\"Quiet\\" reveals the value of the introvert personality type.  Cain says it took her five years to write the book and it shows.  \\"Quiet\\" is one of the best researched books I have ever read.  Cain draws from history, biographies, interviews she conducted, and her own personal experience to paint a rich picture of the quiet temperament.  I could relate to one passage about Stephen Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple Computer.  Cain quotes Wozniak in his book iWoz, \\"Most inventors and engineers I've met are like me--they're shy and they live in their heads,\\" Wozniak writes. \\"They're almost like artists. In fact, the very best of them are artists. And artists work best alone where they can control an invention's design without a lot of other people designing it for marketing or some other committee. I don't believe anything really revolutionary has been invented by committee. If you're that rare engineer who's an inventor and also an artist, I'm going to give you some advice that might be hard to take. That advice is: Work alone. You're going to be best ableto design revolutionary products and features if you're working on your own. Not on a committee. Not on a team.\\"  Cain's book is filled with little vignettes such as this, inspiring introverts like me.  More than a bunch of facts about introverts, Quiet is a fun book too.  I liked Cain's conversational writing style.  \\"Introverts .. may have strong social skills and enjoy parties and business meetings, but after a while wish they were home in their pajamas,\\" Cain says.  Isn't that the truth! (as I write this review in my pajamas :-) )  In chapter after chapter, Cain nails the introvert character type. \\"They prefer to devote their social energies to close friends, colleagues, and family. They listen more than they talk, think before they speak, and often feel as if they express themselves better in writing than in conversation. They tend to dislike conflict. Many have a horror of small talk, but enjoy deep discussions.\\"  If you are an introvert, \\"Quiet\\" will give you a better appreciation of your personality type, and insights on how to use this temperament to your advantage.  I especially liked the tips on how to avoid overextending myself in social situations.  If you are an extrovert, \\"Quiet\\" has value, too, as you will gain an understanding of the introverts in your life.

0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus conjures up a world of elegant fantasy. There's a great deal of beauty, some magic and fantasy, a measure of passion and some tragedy as well. More than that, though, I personally feel the book attempts to show the importance of beauty, mystery and love in all our lives. In summary, I very much enjoyed it.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I originally bought the book thinking of how much I loved the movie and books are always so much better. This was absolutely the case, only to find out that although the basic premise is the same, there are very few connections between the two. I was swept away with the Robert Neville of the story and the total contrast from the Robert Neville of the movie. Overall, the book had me completely captivated throughout and brought me to a new level of thinking when it comes to vampires.

0439796636|5.0|This is an absolutely beautiful story.  BEAUTIFUL.  And I absolutely loved it.  Children's literature holds a special place in my heart and this tugged at just the right strings.<br /><br />The book is about a horse named Joey who started out on a farm.  Albert became his master and best friend.  During the start of World War I, Joey was sold by Albert's father to the military to become a war horse.  Albert, still too young to sign up for service, promised his beloved horse that one day, they will be together again and he will bring Joey home.  Joey experiences - and loses - a lot during this time.  Joey journey's through Europe makes him a captain's steed, then being a part of the veterinary corps, to being a little girl's horse, and finally, back to the front lines.<br /><br />The story is told in Joey's point of view which I loved.  Horses are gorgeous creatures and Morpurgo's interpretation of what's going on in their (at least, Joey's) heads is just breathtaking.  It was so innocent and pure, I appreciated it so much that we are seeing the war and what it did to other people through a horse's eyes.  Throughout Joey's journey, there were laughter and tears, all of it very moving and inspiring.  My heart reached out to Joey, through his losses and hardships.  He is just the purest soul and I felt for him.<br /><br />At less than 200 pages, it is a very easy read.  And seriously, it is so good, you will not be able to put it down.  It will go by so fast and you just want to know what happens next.  I will not compare the book to either the stage play or the movie.  This is one great book that definitely shines on its own.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5.<br /><br />Recommendation: Aimed at the 3rd to 6th grade group but I urge everyone to read it.  It's a small book that leaves a big impression.

B000FS9FCG|4.0|I make love to women.  It is amazing.  You could talk to me all day long and spend every minute trying to convince me it's not amazing.  You would be wasting your time.  I've been to church.  They seems to think otherwise.  They have this terrible fear that homosexuality is a mental disorder caused by venereal demons.  Not to knock a hardworking venerable demon, but I think that people who love to love people with the same organs, just love to love people with the same organs.  They couldn't \\"gay\\" me, and I couldn't straighten them with medieval rack and an empty bottle of wine.  (I use empty wine bottles as rolling pins; quit wasting money you perverts.)  This movie focuses on homosexuality and a handful of characters.  If you wanted someone to translate the book you have already read into a movie, then you'll be five kinds of disappointed.  I don't fault the film for this though.  Alan Moore is an ascended master of the English language.  He took hundreds of pages of English gloom to slowly build a story out of texture in the negative space of his fully developed fascist nightmare.  That's because it took hundreds of pages.  I don't believe a film could do his book justice, any better than the justice served by his fictional, fascist, secret police.  The movie takes a few characters and a few good notes from Alan Moore's book.  Those notes come out a little loud and over the top.  The story isn't quite up to par with the material that inspired it.  I don't want to analyze the whole movie.  I want to speak just on the gay parts.  There are a lot of comments on here about how people think that it's too preachy.  It is preachy; that's fair.  There are also comments about some kind of evil gay agenda.  As if homosexuals were prancing across the park in pink furry boas and playing Queen on flutes to lead the Children of America away to some candy-coated, but ultimately poisoned by AIDS funworld of gay sex.  No one ever tells a dentist how to put his tool in his patient's mouth.  The dentist is clearly the expert, and the patient clearly wants the tool in their mouth.  Why then do straight fuddy-duddies feel comfortable telling gay men and women what they can put in whose mouth?  Aren't the gay folks a little bit more knowledgeable on the topic of gay sex?  I've known a few gay and bi folks that have really appreciated V for Vendetta.  Here, in Louisiana, there are people who think that one day God will bless America with a pharmaceutical cure for perversity.  There are people, under 16 and legally kids, in mental institutions, because their parents couldn't handle them being gay.  So, maybe the movie's tone is too preachy.  It's not too loud.  It might be stumble over it's words, but you cannot ask this movie to put down its megaphone because it's tongue is twisted.  What it has to say, should not be whispered.  Jesus was beautiful.  God is beautiful.  You can be beautiful.  You do not have to hate who you are.  God is love and truth.  I have intellectuals frown on me for saying that I'm Christian.  Why?  I have to explain to them that Bruno was Christian, Joan of Arc was Christian, William Blake was Christian.  I look into a glass darkly, but I want to and will one day see God face to face, as he sees me.  Christianity has turned so far away from this.  Fundamentalists cower together in darkness, huddled under blankets sown from complacency.  They burn broken dreams and forbidden books in a bonfire to keep warm.  They shut their eyes tight so truth, change, and decay can't intrude on their static world of crumbling fear.  They think in the darkness they found God.  They go to kiss him, but they've loved under the threat of hell.  They've loved at the end of the barrel of a gun.  And now they find their lips pressed to that barrel.  And before they pull the trigger themselves, someone has to wake them up.  You are not the contagious mental illnesses you've mistaken for your true self.  You are beautiful.  And you will find someone out there that understands, even if even I don't.
1591843065|4.0|I have been always told I am a visual thinker, as matter of looking at my presentations which largely carry pictures and few bullet points. But, I could not come up with a process to explain how I arrived at them, and this was a concern as I couldn't explain the stages in a process. Back of the Napkin is a perfect book, which breaks the process into pieces that can be applied and presented. I love the author's simplicity and the pictures in them which looks very natural and easy to learn.<br /><br />He has also got a good rational behind ( which is also explained well in each chapter ) on why these method will work & in my case it did work when I did an self exercise. I am very keen to read his next book, unfolding napkin, which I guess will have more examples to learn from.<br /><br />I am not aware of many such books on visualization, but this seems to be a very good to start with - easy and effective.

B006UG90RM|5.0|When I heard the first single I was a little nervous about this new album, but then again I felt the same way when I first heard \\"Jump\\" back in 1984. This record is awesome and Eddie Van Halen has never sounded better, his playing is fast, heavy and inspiring. Alex and Wolf are incredible and Dave is back where he belongs. This is a great new album. Sounds like classic Van Halen to me.
B004Z7AHZC|4.0|\\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Rodrick Rules\\" is one of the more under-rated surprise hit films of last year.  It made the number 1 slot for it's opening weekend at almost $25,000,000.00, a score very few films achieve.  It stole the opening week away from the favored and heavily marketed, lingerie clad bevy of beautiful Hollywood starlets who got \\"Sucker Punched\\" by \\"The Wimpy Kid\\".  The sequel to the very popular 2010 \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" movie, Rodrick Rules focuses on a different element than the first movie.  In the first movie, we find the main characters focus on surviving Middle School, relationships, bullies, family dynamics and popularity.  Both Wimpy Kid movies have been totally under-marketed and definately under-rated as films that are laugh-out-loud funny, relatable and deeply emotional to the masses of theater goers.  In a \\"John Hughes\\" style, Rodrick Rules focuses on family dynamics, relationships, sibling rivalry, and parental frustration at it's core.  Instead of a \\"High School\\" setting that Hughes found so relevant, Wimpy Kid goes deeper into the most troubled and difficult times of our lives -- Jr. High School/Middle School.  This is the jumping off point from childhood with no-where to jump for most of us.  You are no longer treated like a kid, yet your still not old enough to be a teenager or adult.  This is truely \\"no-mans\\" land and the both painful and growing up lessons we learned during this period have etched their mark on our very souls.  In DWK, Rodrick Rules, Mom (played delightfully by Rachel Harris), is trying so hard to get her two older sons to \\"bond\\" with one another.  She goes so far as to offer \\"Mom Bucks\\" (a sort of money payoff) if they spend time together or help each other.  This makes for a very funny ongoing set of comedic circumstances since the two brothers are about as far apart from each other as can be.  The middle son Greg Heffley (played brilliantly by an excellent kid actor - Zachary Gordon) is tormented most of the timeby his older brother Rodrick (played wonderfully by Devon Bostick).  Rodrick would prefer to have nothing to do with his younger sibling, but Mom intervenes and forces the issue because it hurts her to see that they are so disconnected.  Dad (played understatedly well by Steve Zahn) sort of supports the mothers efforts, but really believes in his \\"heart of hearts\\" that mom's plan isn't going to work.  The whole cast is really exceptional and makes you believe in their struggles without much effort.  There are so many funny scenes in this movie, you have to pay attention or you will miss alot of them and the adult inuendo's that fly by at a moments notice.  The story is sensible, realistic, relatable, emotional and heartwarming all at the same time.  We have all lived thru these well played out scenarios in real life and it just makes the connection that much better for us in the film.  There is nothing, not to like about this movie or the first one.  This is a movie for all ages, well, let me qualify.  You have had to have survived or have an undertanding of Jr. High School or Middle School and some family dynamics in order to really connect with the first movie.  This doesn't apply as much to the second movie - DWK Rodrick Rules.  Also, you don't have to have seen the first one to enjoy the second.  If you allow yourself to slip into the movie, you will find yourself caught up in it's web of entertainment.  The movie is simply enjoyable, \\"laugh out loud\\" funny, it will keep your interest, it is paced well, and offers wholesome solid entertainment!  If you are looking for a 3D, computer animated special effects film, you won't find it here.  Instead you'll find a wholesome emotional rollercoaster of enjoyable film entertainment at it's core level.  They have cleverly crafted interactions of live action characters with some of the cartoon characters from the actual Book for a rather interesting effect.  The adaptation to screen is very close, probably the closest I have seen in a book adaptation to screen.  But don't worry, you do not have to read the books to understand these films.  These films are about life, growing up, heartbreak, and finding oneself.  You can watch this movie as a family, with a friend, or simply by yourself...you won't be disappointed!

1442341769|5.0|Richard Dawkins is a well known and respectated evolutionary scientific. All your books are a pinnacle of clarity and good sense. I use them regularly on my university classes (The selfish gene; Evolution; The blind watchmaker; The extended phenotype; etc.).<br /><br />And now, I got this new book for learning how science works and devoted mainly to children, and is also excellent. I've bought the audiobook version with another purpose: to practice English, that is not my native language. And I can tell is good too for this matter. Dawkins and her collaborator spell each word with clarity.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent book that I gladly recommend to anyone who likes to learn basic plain and, at the same time, extraordinary science, and who wants to empower his skills on English.<br /><br />The book is available as paperback, audiobook and iphone app. It is a shame that it does not exists as android app.

B000JIHP88|5.0|I bought 2 mobiles and 1 Einstein soother before finally purchasing this.  This is the only mobile that would fit our crib, and how lucky are we that our daughter absolutely loves it!  We have a sleigh crib and this fits.  Finally!  I was exhausted looking for something that would fit the crib.  She loves to watch the leaves move and the music is nice.  The nature sounds could be louder, but overall I am happy and so is Adyson!

B003PIUC02|5.0|First off received this and Gods of the Arena at same time ordered both together and saved some money. They came extra quick and I didn't pay extra for shipping. Very pleased. If you like the show it is great to catch up to the new Vengence season although I don't like the new actor playing Spartacus now. The series is dope man, not the best for kids though, too bloody and too adult xx for the young, great for adults who don't mind a little. One of my favorite shows now and great to keep even if you have on demand cause it won't always be on there.

0553386794|4.0|First of his A Song of Ice and Fire series, George Martin's 'A Game of Thrones' is set in a brutally realistic and relentless world. It spans two continents; one setting is a typical pre-gunpowder medieval society with several alterations to the world, the second is based on Mongol culture. Martin doesn't hold back - these are harsh civilisations, highly misogynistic, and nobody is exempt.<br /><br />There are two main stories here, divided by the continents though with some small links between them. Both are, basically, political dramas, told in two seperate ways. We get eight viewpoint characters; seven of these are focused on the medieval-set plot that's predominant in this book, and just one perspective is involved in the Mongol-based society.<br /><br />There's a fine line between plot and characters here. On one hand, because it's a story about political intrigue it's necessarily character-driven, so there needs to be a focus on characterisation and it needs to be exemplary. On the other, there are certain strictures on whose viewpoints we see to keep everything running along, meaning that the perspectives we do get tend to have some limitations - we only see get a perspective when it has some sort of relevance to the overall plot, there's rarely a spare scene solely dedicated to the characters and their lives.<br /><br />I think, for the better part, Martin handles this very well. He's very punctual; his prose is competent and meant for communicating information smoothly, with little-to-no emphasis on language. The pace is set very well, the story isn't convoluted and we get what we need to see with very little in between. In every chapter there's something happening. There's twists and turns, tragedy and intrigue. Martin spares no-one from the cruelty of his world, and he often does this well, to have an effect that resonates through the rest of the story.<br /><br />The part I think he doesn't quite get right is characterisation. I found it a bit hit and miss - his characters have their own pasts, their own defining characteristics, and I found all of this believable, but with some characters I felt it was taken too much to an extreme, and this is where I had trouble believing the characters. I still feel a little unsure about it. While I was reading I didn't particularly notice it, but on reflection it sticks out.<br /><br />There's very little magic here, and what magic there is tends to break away from the ordinary fantasy tropes. We don't see much of it, lending to the realisation of this world, but it's obvious that several stereotypical fantasy things will make an appearance, whilst the more interesting magical revelations leave a sense of originality and intrigue.<br /><br />There's no hard finish here. Instead there's a semi-conclusive ending which clearly sets up the future books, much like others publishing multi-book tales. Nevertheless, the story is satisfying, with more than a few surprises which made the plot stand out. It hasn't quite gripped me yet, but if Martin continues in this vein then the rest of the series looks very promising.<br /><br />4.5/5, their own defining characteristics, and I found all of this believable, but with some characters I felt it was taken too much to an extreme, and this is where I had trouble believing the characters.

B00715SUI6|5.0|I thought this sequel was just as scary, as the other two and I just loved it. I was jumping and covering my eyes, which is why I love a good horror flick, which is hard to come by lately. I think it does justice to the series and look forward to the next one.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Much of the credit must go to Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine. He signed them and assured the final mix (VH identity) of this album was locked in. Shadows from the board room to the studio stoked the fire of this project. Seldom does it work that way. Somewhere Ted Templeman and Donn Landee are smiling. 5 stars.  Mexia Texas USA
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by Lana del Ray's debut release \\"Born to Die.\\" Every one of the 12 cuts is listenable and highlights her unique voice and range along with great beats, lyrics, and strings/instrumentation. We've all heard \\"Video Games\\" but a few other cuts stand-out including \\"Radio\\" and \\"Summertime Sadness.\\" Lana's style and vibe falls somewhere in between Lady Gaga and Madonna without over-mimicry. Even if she were a poseur or a media creation, so what? The music speaks (or, in this case, rocks) for itself. \\"How do you like her now?\\"
B000002AS3|5.0|It seems like very ten years or so some band leads the charge from Britain.<br />In '77 it was the Sex Pistols. In '85 it was the Stone Roses. In '94 it was Oasis.<br /><br />The sound will blow your socks off. This band had the swagger and the chops. They not only could fire off a sonic assault (\\"Bring It On Down\\") but also knew how to tone it all down (\\"Live Forever\\"). An amazing piece of work and you have to love the Rodney Marsh pic by the fireplace on the cover. Look closely along the window sill as you'll also see the other coin of that Manchester Swingin' '60s soccer culture--George Best of rivals Manchester United--as guitarist Paul \\"Bonehead\\" Arthurs is a United supporter.<br /><br />(The weird thing is although Marsh was a supremely talented soccer player, when Man City picked him up during March of the 1971/72 season City's title hopes got derailed as he just did not get in sync with the squad. So I'd say that was an odd choice as no right-minded City supporter would go with Marsh as their \\"hero\\" over, say, Colin Bell, Mike Summerbee or Francis Lee of that 1970s side. Now if they were Tampa Bay Rowdies' fans, I could see having a pic of Rodney.)<br /><br />Back to the subject at hand--if you buy one Oasis record, get this and you will not be disappointed unlike their latter albums.
B005EM8O8O|5.0|We have yet to grasp more than a hint of the forces unleashed by the creation of the Internet and, more recently, the World Wide Web. The Fear Index dramatizes one possible chain of events that could upend human society.<br /><br />This chilling novel is set in Geneva, home of CERN, the European scientific research center that houses the Large Hadron Collider and which spawned the World Wide Web in 1991. There, an extraordinarily brilliant and eccentric American physicist, Dr. Alexander Hoffmann, exercised his passion for artificial intelligence (AI) for several years until his experiments ran afoul of his superiors at the lab. Shortly afterward, Hoffmann entered into a partnership with Hugo Quarry, an English financier who volunteered to provide him with the virtually unlimited data needed to pursue his research. Their partnership, a hedge fund, is based on Hoffman's evolving AI research. The fund quickly grew to multibillion-dollar proportions because of the accuracy of the securities-trading algorithms developed by Hoffmann and his band of eccentric young mathematical researchers.<br /><br />Though this novel may come across as sheer fantasy, and Harris' depiction of AI is off base in some respects, it's grounded in reality. Many hedge funds do conduct automatic trading using algorithms to make decisions by the millisecond. And the events that dominate The Fear Index bear an unsettling resemblance to a very dark day in Wall Street's recent history.<br /><br />The action starts quickly in The Fear Index and builds steadily to a crescendo in a deply troubling conclusion. A synopsis of the action would make little sense. Read it yourself, and you'll probably have trouble putting it down.<br /><br />The Fear Index is British writer Robert Harris' 14th book. His previous seven novels were Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, and The Ghost (released as a feature film under the title The Ghost Writer). If those titles seem familiar, it's no accident: every one sold well, some were bestsellers, and several were adapted for film or television.<br /><br />(From [...])several were adapted for film or television.

B004X80QNG|4.0|Great PIM, Just like working with the old palm software. I have tried many different calendar applications but always went back to the default on my droid x, Until now. Informant just WORKS! And works well I might add.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have never seen a timer/alarm app with as many options as this one.  I use it every day to give me notices of something that is coming up on my calendar.  I especially like the feature that allows you to start the volume of an alarm low and raise it to a user-defined maximum level.  I'm also quite fond of the ability of this app to define a set of frequently used settings as the default for all future new timers created.<br /><br />The free version of the app does have advertisements, but they are fairly unobtrusive since they show up at the bottom of the screen and can easily be ignored.  Very useful and free.  I highly recommend this app.

B005OK721G|1.0|Amazon ran a special on this today. 99 cents for streaming of the movie. Not worth the dollar. Bad plot, bad acting and an implausible script. Movie was 1 hour and 49 minutes. I could not wait for it to be over. In fact I turned if off with 10 minutes to go. That is 1 hour and 49 minutes of my life I will never get back.

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I'm not normally a fan of costume dramas as so many of them are poorly done, but this one's had me hooked from the start.  Historically accurate with excellent writing and acting, and chock full of well-defined characters and engrossing plots and sub-plots.  Very well done and worthy of the \\"Masterpiece\\" label.  From the reviews on Amazon, I gather that there's a lot of confusion over which edition contains what material as well as what hardware is needed.  So just to confirm, this edition, i.e., the \\"PBS Original UK Edition Blu-Ray\\" includes the entire second season along with the Christmas Special, which chronologically follows the second season and advances the story lines so is not to be missed, plus three small features:  Fashion & Uniforms, Romance in a Time of War and House to Hospital.  The DVDs will play on a US Blu-Ray DVD player.  Enjoy.
B006UG90RM|5.0|FOR 100 points for the VAN HALEN FANS. What track has the sheep dog bark and Dave's call DOG, in the background? - Dave has been training sheep dogs in addition to a medic. Answer - Track 8 HoneyBabySweetieDoll<br /><br />Listen to the full album twice. Listen to perfect harmonies. Listen to Bass Lines and Fills that are equal to or an upgrade over previous versions of the band. They miss Michael Anthony the way a church would miss a pew. Their are several songs that I would consider hits. Blood and Fire, Stay Frosty and The trouble with never come to mind.<br /><br />Go to the West Coast where they stay frostyiest the most. Better tie up your camel. - Stay Frosty<br /><br />Welcome to Chinatown, It's All happening downtown, Welcome to my town! - ChinaTown<br /><br />Christopher Walken would love track 13. He feels the need for more cowbell. Van Halen delivers Cowbell. - Skit with Will Farel, The reaper, SNL<br /><br />\\"It's not who you squeeze, but who returns to squeeze you. No doubt. Love em all, I says, Let cupid sort them out\\". - As Is, Van Halen<br /><br /> It certainly is not the same without Sammy. No high pitch screaming and poor lyrics. This is the classic Van Halen of the first 6 albums.<br /><br /> The more you listen to this Album, you realize what incredible chemistry the core of the group has. Van Halen gives Hard Rock it's meaning. If listening on a laptops horrid speakers not the same. Need a headset or a car stereo. 5 tracks are unfinished songs from demo tapes. The group went back and finished them. Amazing the creative output of Eddie Van Halen. He claims to have 7 albums of material in the vaults. The real surprise is Wolfgang Vanhalen on bass guitar and back ground vocals. The entire album would hang with the best the band has ever output. This reminds me of Prince at his productive peak. The music gets better with every listen. The band sorely missed Diamond Dave's bluesy voice. The band sounded a little bit like journey during the Sammy Hagar period. A sober and rejuvenated Edward Van Halen has never sounded better. Alex and Wolf produce an incredible fast moving pocket. Wolf's fills are incredible. For someone who graduated in the era of \\"Women and Children First\\", this is a gift of god. Like the Beatles reforming 30 years after their last album to miraculously create the best work of their career from a hard rock perspective with blues undertones. I must say I felt real old reading the Album's liner notes. Wolfgang thanking his Dad Edward Van Halen, Mom Valerie, Uncle Alex. The lyrics all have a certain wisdom of age. As Dave would say \\" To become a monk you've got to cook a lot of rice\\". \\"There is a trick to Christian values and it is compulsory\\" Stay Frosty. What a breath of fresh air. Highly paid professional musicians making great music with the best front man ever Diamond Dave. No autotune. No scowling hip hop artist. No samples. No mc.

B0067LY4WG|3.0|I'm a L.C. fan but after five listens, it's not his best but still worth a listen. Cohen's stuff is better than most out there so a 3 star for him is at least a 4 star for most others. I just don't hear any classics on this album...yet. His voice has gotten deeper since he quit smoking and I wonder if it's almost too deep! Still, for the man who's pushing 80 and is still cranking tunes out and preparing to tour again--my buddy and I saw him in Detroit 2 years ago and he was great!--you gotta hand it to him. Take a listen to Leonard's son Adam's work--\\"Adam Cohen\\" and \\"Like a Man\\" CDs--a chip off the ol' block but with his own style and voice.

My son gave it to me for my birthday (and how can you refuse to read something your son picks out for you????) and so I read it.  Loved the story, characters and learned how the French were involved in the War  (didn't know that)!!!  I couldn't put the book down until I finished it.  Would recommend ------definitely a GOOD READ!!!

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Men, this movie can change your life.  It can put you on the road to leaving a legacy that will carry those left behind for the rest of their days.  It's the way you WANT to be remembered; however, we need to do those things today that will win the prize.  I've seen a lot of \\"guy\\" movies...you know, Clint Eastwood, etc.  Tough on the outside, raunchy mouth, kickin' kind of guy. We all think that's what the world wants, just like we've been lied to about what will really make us happy in a woman.  For both men and women, we crave a person of character who is loving to their family.  This movie is for men.  It reminds us of what being a man is REALLY about.  So long to Hollywood's version that has resulted in unrelating guys and broken homes.  Home success is the true victory.  Let's commit to those women we sleep with and raise the kids we plant in them.  Enough messes on our streets. Do you really have the stuff, or do you want to remain a child all your life?  Come on. Let's make this a better nation, one wife and child at a time!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I admit it. I resisted reading the first book because of all the hype. I dislike books that have been hyped up so much. I always feel there is a reason they have to have that much attention. The first book was very good. I enjoyed the pace and the purpose. The book flowed very well and the plot was truly the star. The 2nd book was still enjoyable, but I found the indecision of the heroine a bit irritating. I thought she would be more concrete based on her past situations. The 3rd book I enjoyed the least, but considering I loved the series, that isn't saying much. In the last book I thought the journey towards the end went on a little too long and could have been wrapped up sooner.  Overall this is a wonderful series with an equally interesting message for the world today.

B004L35GAQ|5.0|AWOLNATION (originally the solo project of musical genius Aaron Bruno) has somehow managed to thrive despite being unique, creative, and not signed to a major record label. In a time when the same garbage gets played every day on the radio, I was shocked when I first heard Sail on my local radio station. I bought the Back from Earth EP and was shocked again at the quality of the other songs. I've been following AWOLNATION ever since and this full-length debut is proof that they're only getting better. Bruno has surrounded himself with a group of talented musicians with great chemistry to make AWOLNATION into a full-fledged powerhouse of a band (I highly recommend seeing them live - I have twice and they were incredible both times).  As for the musical style of this album, AWOL takes the idea of a \\"genre\\" and headbutts it with an astronaut helmet. Electro, metal, pop, alternative rock, funk, industrial, hip-hop (even a surprisingly good guest rapper on the bonus track \\"Knights of Shame\\") can all be found mixed together to create something that makes you want to headbang, breakdance, chill out, and make love all within the span of a few seconds. It's almost impossible to describe AWOLNATION's \\"sound\\" other than in terms of quality: excellent. There isn't a song (not counting the intro and 2 interludes, tracks 1, 2 & 9) that I would rate less than 4 out of 5, and each has a completely unique sound. That being said, the most standout tracks in my opinion, in order, are \\"Guilty Filthy Soul,\\" \\"Knights of Shame,\\" \\"Sail,\\" \\"Soul Wars,\\" \\"Kill Your Heroes,\\" and \\"Not Your Fault.\\" But for only $9, you probably won't find a better deal than this entire album.

0156027321|4.0|Never are opinions more divided than when you talk books, that's why you read vile-filled 1-star reviews that marvel at the stupidity of those who would enjoy such a book listed side-by-side with the starry-eyed, glowing remarks of those who absolutely loved it. That is, unless you talk music. Or sports teams. Or...  Sometimes you just have to be in the right mood for the genre. Other times, the opinions stated in a book shouldn't rankle your nerves or clash with your own personal viewpoints and philosophies. Then there are also those moments that, if you don't like or understand a character, you're not going to care enough about what they do to bother reading to find out.  This is a book that centers around a single protagonist -- his worries, his joys, his struggles and his inspirations. You'll like it if you enjoy witnessing the conflicts and complications in one person's life because Pi is an interesting and sympathetic character, admirable because of how he manages to get through a desperate, grotesque situation. Yes, there is crass and gross descriptions of death and survival and all the mundane points which make up a day isolated at sea.  I was personally fascinated by how he managed to do it without going insane, interested in his memories and opinions and plans and schemes, and especially compelled to keep reading because I truly wanted to find out what happened.  The behavior of the tiger is also interesting... I also kept reading to unravel the mystery of its companionship with Pi. That unnatural partnership was different and therefore something new.  I like reading something new.  I enjoy survival stories, though, and have always been drawn to them. Although it isn't a true comparison, the basic premise in Life of Pi that is similar to that of The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, by Stephen King. Each has a combination of wonder, coming of age, and blunt survival. I listened to this as an audiobook rather than read it, and it felt as if I was sitting firesidewith Pi as he recounted his journey to me...that helped my being able to make a connection.  Personally, I did think the first few chapters were a bit too dry and \\"talky\\" with all the background details about the zoo and Pi's familial and religious upbringing, so I listened less intently to that part, but from the shipwreck on, I was hooked. By the end of the book, I was inspired because it felt like I shared a bit of triumph along with Pi, made it through a difficult experience and learned from it right along with Pi. Isn't that one of the greatest things about books? Being able to go places you'd never go and know people you'd never otherwise know and see things from a perspective you've never had before?  I've rated Life of Pi 4 out of 5 stars on its merits as literature: strong character development; well-structured story with the perfect balance of highs and lows, conflicts and complications; vividly descriptive language; and overall \\"production values\\" as it's put together cohesively. Its flaw is in the slow, dragging beginning which (in my opinion at least) doesn't completely jive with the rest of the book -- it's necessary background for understanding the character but I couldn't help but feel it could've been presented more succinctly or in a more active voice.  Those who bash the book with 1 star and call it \\"boring\\" are being unfair.  If survival stories with brutally blunt descriptions of life and death don't interest you, then this isn't the book for you. Reading such a book then saying it's a bad book would be like knowing you hate nuts, ordering a bowl of Hagan Dazs Butter Pecan ice cream then declaring that Hagan Dazs makes the worst ice cream you've ever tasted.  Life of Pi is, overall, perfect when you are in the mood for something both harrowing and inspired, with a satisfying ending that may make you look at your own life with a bit more appreciation.

1594744769|2.0|I was pretty excited by the reviews for this, enough so that ran out and bought it rather than tracking it down at a local library as I usually would. Man, I wish I would have saved my money, this is a book I'd gladly return after two weeks. It's not bad, but it's pretty dull until the end and even then it doesn't make it really worth having read the whole thing. I just plodded through it, I felt.
B00746O3X8|1.0|Be warned: you really do get what you pay for! Don't think for a second that at thirty bucks you're buying a system that will reliably support your camera. Learn from my mistake. Everything about the Opteka knock-off is cheap \\"dollar store grade\\" plastic or thin material. Flimsy! The hub won't stay tight on your camera so when it comes loose (and it will!) the weight of your camera suddenly danging from their \\"safety cord\\" will BREAK the D-ring or snap. Yes, the plastic is that cheap! There's no way to use your tripod with this system. Do yourself a favour and get a real Cotton Carrier. Now I have a system I can completely trust and the Opteka is in some landfill somewhere--I could not even give it away to my worst enemy!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved this book! Read this book. A wonderful love story. And what if we could go back in time and influence a new future. Would we really want to? Maybe. Maybe not...
B003SI605K|2.0|Wanting to understand Chinese culture more in-depth was hoping I would gain some effemeral insight with this film, albeit dated. What a pos... I did not read the book but the film is a complete whine fest and a suprreme showcase of how spineless  Chinese woman are and there is no way I believe that.  Everytime I heard the 'reverie' music which was the prelude to some sorry tale that attempted to wrench viewers hearts and align sympathy, I cringed.  Asian women age well and are very poised, wonder what they think of American women, resilient, tolerant, forgiving, open, strong, anything useful gained from immigrating here??? Would love to hear some feedback on better avenues of education, this attempt was deplorable.

B001CC7PPI|3.0|Jimmy commenting on Ms. Lovelorn's date being too young when Hitch slomo's a kiss between Grace n Granpa is chokeworthy... He can't even get up to get a glass of water but she happily plops on his lap numerous times and that backrub by Thelma spells OUCH! He has a full leg cast wrapped around his pants! and has to go thru his belt to scratch his leg, ROFL!! She is so perfect and sells $1100 dresses hourly and wears gowns to a Queens 3rd floor bachelor walkup with not even a freakin fan??? I loved the gymnastics girl, she had talent, more animated than Kelly, who is absolutely gorgeous but flat and miscast.  The suspense was palpable for last 5minutes, and I was surprised at how well lit the interiors were in the other apartments, kudos DP!  This is my least fav Hitch suspense, too many script/plot errors, you can hear phone convo on both sides when no important info is conveyed, etc., Kelly climbing ladders at midnight, digging up graves, intriguing comedy! A little balance between male/female beauty would be much appreciated.
B004SMD4H2|5.0|What can be said about HAVEN? Is great, fun, intriguing, entertaining, made for strong minded people. All the characters in the first season are strong!.....Emely Ross is oustanding as an FBI agent sent to investigate all those rare events happening in the town of HAVEN..... The results, you must see by yourselfs. I really enjoy good TV and this is fabulous!

B003INBOEC|5.0|I won't repeat what others have already said, but not only does this have the best kung-fu sequences I have ever seen, but it has an amazing story line to it as well. Even my 10 year old daughter fully loved this movie, which says something about the right amount of action and story line....great for the whole family.

0812550757|5.0|I liked Ender's Game but didn't care for it much my second time around because in the meantime I had read SftD, Xenocide, and CotM, which made Ender's Game seem quite devoid of depth.  Card wove together a great deal of ideas.  While it was a bit hard to follow the first time, the proceeding volumes flow much better as he got a handle on the story.  A big influence on me.  Worth a read!

B006ZDU7QI|2.0|Don't get me wrong, but \\"Somebody that I used to know\\" is so so so so amazingly good, it puts you on such a high, that your expectations get blown so way out of proportion, that when you listen to the rest of the album it's a let down. The only other decent song on here is \\"Eyes Wide Open.\\" The rest are all forgettable, and you're just lying and forcing yourself to listen to the other songs for some silly reason. \\"Somebody\\" is just that good, and it's all because of Kimbra.  Gotye's singing is good on that song as well, but for the rest of the album, particularly in the second half, it all just sounds like a bunch of B-sides that never really got fleshed out or produced properly. Weak singing and harmonics and some reminiscences to the stuff from the 80's. That's about it. Don't waste your money. I made a mistake in buying the whole album.
B006W0QOF2|2.0|Slow pointless movie.  Bad acting, poor directing.  I kept waiting to see if there would be some great car chase scenes, but even those were medicore.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun games to play but u do have to win the first so many to unlock new ones but over all fun way to pass the time with cute challenging mini games
B006W0QOF2|3.0|I went into this movie with the wrong expectations.  I like Goslin and thought that this was a straight-up action film.  It isn't.  It is actually very light on the action and slow-paced.  Some have called it \\"hip\\", \\"indie\\", \\"artsy\\" and similar but to me it was weird.  The actors were great, the atmosphere was great, but the movie just didn't work for me.  However, it isn't a bad movie at all.  It is defiantly worth a watch to see what you think.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This book has more than enough reviews telling you how amazing it is. And I will tell you that they are all right. The cover absolutely won me over. I honestly could not stop looking at it, but I couldn't bring myself to spend $10 on a kindle book (I'm a poor graduate student, $10 is a lot, no matter how much I want to support writers). I also wasn't sold on the idea of a Cinderella story. Of all the fables, this is not one of my favorite, but it's not bad either. The futuristic cyborg point of view drew me. So, I picked up the first 5 chapters for free, and on my lunch break, literally ate through them.<br /><br />I love Cinder--she is an amazing main character. Did I pick up on the ending in like the 5 or 6 chapter, or whenever they first mention a supposedly dead princess? YES. No author in their right mind would have just \\"made a mention\\" of this if it wasn't important, though I guess you could argue it goes to show how insanely crazy the lunar queen is. However, even knowing, I didn't care. I couldn't wait for her to figure it, for it to all come out. I have mixed feelings about Kai--I'm not sold on him. Personally, he needs to grow a set, though he appears to be going in that direction by the end. OK, yes, he is trying to listen to his adviser, but there's just something about him. Maybe we just haven't seen enough of him, but so far he feels kind of inconsistent to me.  Also, his random obsession with Cinder kind of comes from nowhere, but eh, hormones are hormones.<br /><br />I would also have liked to see more of the hatred against the cyborgs. I don't understand why people hate them so much; if there had been a war or something, but these are people who have been saved by science. They didn't start out androids and develop feelings; they were human, and I get the impression that some of them are still mostly human (guy in the virus lab that is only 6.4% machine or something). Apparently Cinder, with her 36% (I think...) android body is unusual, so I don't see why they are so alienated, and hated. And believe, you get the picture that they are considered serious freaks. People seem to treat the androids better than cyborgs and that's just a little too weird for me without some serious explanation.<br /><br />Oh and yeah, after the five chapters, I totally spent the $10. My only main complaint is how short this book felt. Granted, I checked afterwards and it says it's 400 pages in hardback. I don't know if they're using a large font, or this book just sucks you in so much that you have no idea how much you've read. Either way, the cliff hanger ending was extremely frustrating. Yes, I knew there were 4 more books. The kindle edition tells you when the others should be released, all in one year increments. No, I did not realize the book had just been released last month (seriously, I barely glanced at that page). And yes, I expected a bit more of a wrap-up then we got. I think I paced my apartment for half an hour trying to come to terms that I was literally screwed until next year. I was also left with an overwhelming urge to find and beat Kai, but I won't tell you why. Read it, love it, and then hate it until you re-read it next year before continuing into the second. Because this will be in your re-read list. It's just that much fun.alienated, and hated. And believe, you get the picture that they are considered serious freaks.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|A number of folks have said these types of games at $1.99 are too short.  I disagree.  I finished under 3 hours without using hints.  It might be possible to finish under two hours if you use hints (disclaimer: not known how good the hints are).  Console games typically have a play time between 10-40 hours @$60.  Taking the high end, you therefore are paying about $1.5 per hour of game @$60 for a 40 hour game.  Therefore $1.99 for 3 hours of play is still a value.  Let's look at it another way: movies are $10 for 2 hours of entertainment.  If you write that this game is too short for the money then you must never watch movies in the theater.  I rate the diffulculty of the puzzles from EASY to MEDIUM.  Most require thought and you won't immediately see the answer.  I must admit that one puzzle I did not solve (blurred characters), but enough clues within the game where I could randomly guess the answer.  My small gripe with the game is the map.  The map builds out as you play but you can only see a large section at a time (you are unable to resize the map to see the entire map).  A more user friendly experience would allow the map to resize and \\"fast travel\\" to any spot that you have been too.  Luckily the map isn't too huge where going from one end of the map to the other is a chore.  Overall I enjoyed the game and even at $1.99 I felt that I got my money's worth.  I'll get even more once I forget about the game and return to The Lost City :)
B002ZG98UK|4.0|Well, it has to be your own for the most part. Look at the wide variety of ratings for this movie. Most of the 1-3 star rated reviews mainly talk about how bad the movie is for the acting, writing and so on. To me, no, it was not the better of any in the franchise but it was not unwatchable as some remarked. There's some pretty cool stuff going on. Some are complaining that \\"this is a zombie movie, where are all the zombies\\"? The fact is that this is NOT a zombie movie. It's a thriller about a woman infected with a virus but instead of turning into an un-dead, flesh-eating creature, she aquires exceptional abilities and vows to destroy the corporation/people/person responsible who are desperately trying to capture her for their own purposes. This is sort of the same complaint people have about, \\"The Walking Dead\\". Not enough zombies. Hey, I like 'em as much as the next fan but you just can't have zombies in every aspect of the film. They are the main thing that drives the story and are always in the back of your mind, but they don't always have to be in your face. Suspense and fear are key factors in a movie like this. Then read some of the 4-5 star reviews. Those concentrate more on the 3D aspect of the movie. Most have a favorable review yet I've seen others elsewhere that say the 3D effect is nominal for the most part and one might wonder if their 3D glasses were even working. Live action 3D does not look as good as animated 3D. Also remember there are native 3d and conversion 3D movies. Goggle, \\"complete list of full hd 3d titles\\". Native being the better looking, (like RE:A). Then, are these people using passive or active-shutter glasses? It makes a big difference. I think some people tend to be looking for the 3D so much that they actually miss it. It's kinda like those \\"magic eye\\" pictures from the '80's. You have to relax and let your eyes naturally focus in then you see the hidden picture. I thought the 3D effect was very good, although it is the only live-action disc I have now.<br /><br />So, to sum it all up, if your an R E fan, you may like this movie no matter what or you may find it disappointing. I think the 3D effects are very good but remember not everything will have a 3D look as with most any I've seen so far. Thanks for reading.
B004ZN9ERI|5.0|The best and most innovative of all the Floyd albums.  Later PF were a technological triumph in their use of the recording studio and production methods, but this is a sonic masterpiece of a different sort.  Syd Barrett wrote songs like no one else before or since, from the psychedelia of Intersteller Overdrive to the whimsy of the Gnome, the beauty of See Emily Play, or the disturbing yet playful Bike. Lyrically, Roger Waters specialized in bleak, morose social commentary, whereas Barrett wrote wonderous songs that had a fairy tale quality.

B0052U59F4|3.0|I was so excited to read this racy book.  I devoured the first half and by the second half it was just repetitive and boring.  There is almost no plot and the characters are poorly developed.  I kept waiting to hear some bombshell about Christian Grey's upbringing but it never happened-just one line about his birth mother and a few lines about a past relationship.  The character Ana is so flat and even Christian's character is so unbelievable.  He is a biliionaire but with tons of time for BDSM and has never loved except for Ana, come on...  The book has no value except for the few hot sex parts.  I will not be reading the next book and I don't know how this book can cost 29.99 or even 9.99 for the kindle.  Also if you have no interest in Dominant/Submissive do not even bother.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a great app. gives a sense of owning something. point system is flawless.recommended game for those who want a reward for gaming.
B003YUOJQO|3.0|Quality and color are great although I am surprised that my last set of size 11 Crocs fit perfectly, but these are too snug to use with socks.

0061743526|5.0|This is one of those books that really makes society take a good, long look at itself.  When I was toward the end of high school I really got into 20th century history, specifically US, and was told to read this book.  The story centers around a black man wrongly accused of raping a white girl.  In the south (imagine that).  Of course, we all know what \\"should have happened\\" to him (I'm not saying it's right, rather that was the normal course of action then.  History is history, it cannot be changed no matter how awful it is.), and have him sent away to prison for the rest of his life, if not worse.  This is where the story takes a twist.  A determined defense lawyer steps up and takes the case, and do what's right.  He is ridiculed, harrassed and threatened, but remains steadfast in his role of defender of the innocent.<br /><br />The only disappointing thing about this novel is that it's Harper Lee's only novel.  The writing is wonderful and the story is brilliant.  We may never know why she only wrote this one novel, but she did a damn good job it.

B0071FBARY|5.0|One of the first MP3 downloads I purchased on Amazon.com was The Fray's self titled album in 2009. I was mesmerized by the piano lead and vocals and lyrics by Isaac Slade. Any poet worth his weight in salt will testify the lyrics originate from an authentic core of loss, pain, and ultimate redemption. I take issue with mainstream pop rock critics that underrate this exceptionally unique band. Comparisons to Coldplay and Keane are myopic at best. Their creative resonance and wordplay are different in their approach to storytelling. The Fray come off far more serious and straightforward than any of their comparative peers. It troubles me when critics from the major music magazines three star them, and write the band `lacked originality\\" and the album itself lacked any \\"inspiration and excitement\\". They just don't get it. When the lyrics in all of The Fray's albums revolve around life's problems and issues. Common themes include happiness, sadness, death,evil, of relationships, and war. The honest and emotional nature of the The Fray's songs has critics labeling them as \\"emo\\" or emotionally driven. In all honesty, what great song has not embraced emotion thoroughly? Scars and Stories thematically is about those painfully rough parts in our lives and discovering a way to love our way out or through them. The Fray is better than ever at expressing them, having two albums behind them and the critical bruises as proof. Is it The Fray's quest to be our ambassadors of giving us honesty instead of pop fluff? Yes, I'd say it is, and I'm grateful they are, because they do it so well. Buy \\"Scars & Stories\\" and find out where The Fray ends up. A clue is in the album cover. They aren't running away from the hurt,after listening to it they're running toward the love and joy they justly desererve.
B006UG90RM|5.0|You really have to give this CD a listen with Dave's lyrics from the CD insert in front of you because they come so fast and furious sometimes your brain cannot process how good they actually are.    Top to bottom it is a great album... \\"Big River,\\" \\"She's the Woman,\\" \\"The Trouble with Never,\\" \\"You and Your Blues,\\" and \\"Stay Frosty\\" as stand outs. Songs like \\"China Town,\\" \\"Bullethead,\\" \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll,\\" need the lyric sheet the first time to really enjoy. \\"Outta Space\\" being the only track I don't fire up.    No matter what you think of \\"Tattoo\\" it really doesn't fit with the rest of this album. Minus it, the album is much harder than I think anyone expected. This is a good thing... See \\"Mean Streets,\\" \\" Unchained,\\" for you hits only people out there fire up deep cuts like \\"Dirty Moves,\\" \\"Here about it later,\\" \\"Take your whiskey home...\\"
0439023513|4.0|*Subtle Spoilers*  I enjoyed how Gale was revealed to be incredibly brainy and suprisingly cold.  I also liked him constantly hanging out with Beetee.  Gale=Nerd=Win.  I am also still mourning the loss of one of my favorite characters and will never forgive Ms. Collins for killing him off.  The death of a character important to the lead evened out the balance though.  I guess a high death count is supposed to make things seem more \\"real\\" and/or tragic.  The reason why a lot of people (with less years on them) were disappointed in this book/series was probably the weakness of the lead.  She screws up a lot and is prone to falling into despair (though not as badly as her mother).  Many (less-seasoned) readers were expecting Katniss to be a decisive, absolute hero rather than the reluctant, hot n' cold hero.  (I don't really use the word \\"heroine.\\")  I'm more disappointed in the structure and pacing.  There are too many instances where Katniss blacks out and the next chapter starts up with her waking up again.  But I guess that's \\"realistic\\" considering all the physical punishment she goes though.  She's a human, not from the planet Krypton.  I was satisfied with the ending and who Katniss ended up with.  I liked how they were both immensely damaged from the events and how Katniss had to be coaxed into love.  Wonder how the deadlines Scholastic gave Collins and her editor affected the structure and pacing.  In an ideal world, creating a story would not have any deadlines, but we live in a world where time and money must be given priority.  After all, time and money are quantitative resources, while creativity is not.

B000001ESP|5.0|It was not until Rush released their 7th album that they truly achieved commercial success. 1981's Moving Pictures was a turning away from Rush's progressive metal masterpeices into more AOR friendly musical offerings. Tom Sawyer is easily recognizale and has a futuristic style and sound to the music. This is mostly due to the influence of drummer Neil Peart who was the mastermind behind such Rush classics as A Farewell To Kings and 2112. His scientifically inspired themes became the foundation on which Rush built their collective legendary status as both muscians and songwriters. In addition, guitarist Alex Lifeson was always inspiring as a jazz/fusion guitarist. Bassist Geddy Lee, who is a unique vocal talent and stupendous bassist offered a great counterwieght to both Lifeson and Peart. Probably the second most famous track on the album is Limelight. The song is a more mature and reflective piece featuring many nuggets of wisdom. The albums most agressive track, Red Barchetta used a hot Italian sports car as inspiration. Peart's drumming is precise and devastating on the track, one of the standout tracks of his long and storied career as one of rocks greatest drummers. He also employs a electro-mechanical drum system during the solo section of this track. YYZ is a meandering \\"jam\\" session, Lee, Lifeson, and Peart engaging thier insturments with collective brillance. This album is a must have for any Rush fan, progressive metal fan(although the bands previous 3 releases are best in this genre), as well as any collection of early eighties metal.

B005UBNKWO|5.0|For the price, this processor cannot be beat.  Is it going to beat an Intel processor that costs three times as much or more?  No, but then most people are comparing apples to oranges.  Great speed, cool, uses less power than many comparable processors.  Use a good motherboard, video card and memory and you will not be disappointed when it comes to gaming.  And, unlike a previous poster, make sure you use a socket AM3+ motherboard.  Just a great processor for a great price.

0439023521|5.0|This is the BEST book I've read in a long time.  I couldn't put this book down and would find my self at 2 or 3 in the morning still fighting with myself to go to sleep.  The characters were exciting and the twists and turns throughout the game were non-predictable.  I hope to see more from this author in the future.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I didn't know what cover to get and finally decided on the Microshell Folio Cover by Marware.  It turned out to be a great value.  Very easy to use and seems very durable.
B004QO9WVO|1.0|The book was delivered to my Kindle as promised, but the free audio book which was supposed to be part of the package proved impossible to get.  Emails to Edwards Publishing requesting a download link went unanswered and in the end I gave up and got a refund, so apologies to Conan Doyle, whose Sherlock Holmes stories are always a treat, but a warning to other customers that you don't get what you pay for when you buy the Kindle edition of this book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well the games are cheap but very interesting and tooling mannyyy ADS!!!!!!! but overall its right you will be playing the games for hours.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|works great on kindle fire,  no lag, and gives you something to do. try it for some friendly free chess fun.
B005SS2QXS|4.0|This is a simple rubber case for an iPhone.<br /><br />The rubber covers the front of the phone on the top & bottom unlike most bumper cases.<br />I dropped it on the carpet from about 5 feet & had no problems.<br />Can't say whether it will protect the phone from a higher fall onto a harder surface but it looks like it will do OK.<br /><br />All the cutouts align perfectly with the various ports.<br />You have to remove the cover in order to plug the phone in to a speaker dock (I listen with headphones & use an iPod Classic with a dock anyway.)<br /><br />No issues with the camera or flash.<br /><br />It sticks to your pocket a bit when you try to pull it out but not to the point of being annoying.<br />Ditto on the annoyance factor for lint attraction.<br /><br />All in all it's a much more attractive albeit less formidable alternative to the Otter Box.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|it is a very good game if you like the investagating type. it did start off a little slow but after a while it got me not even want to look up so I think this is very good and interesting.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|There is considerable substantial evidence that Edward DeVere actually wrote the \\"Shakespeare Plays and Sonnets,\\" based upon several well researched books. The  Shakespeare character was a merchant, who could barely write, and barely had any education to speak of, and hardly anything is known about him.  At the time, it was not accepted for the nobility to be part of the theatre. Thus, Shakepeare was recruited to be the front man for the Shakepearian Plays. The movie Anonymous does a great job of presenting the Man, Edward Devere, as the real author of the Shakepearan Plays.
B002BWP49M|5.0|...I just got it....4pm and it is being offered at midnight in WALMART!!!!....that goes to show how I love AMAZON!....its the best!...and now I will sit with a big bag of popcorn...and enjoy for the second time this favorite movie of mine....in BLUE RAY!
B00319ECGU|5.0|Clint Eastwood is sexy!! There's only 1 weak link in this collection and that's The Dead Pool. All the others are A+ movies. It's worth getting the collection as opposed to the movies individually.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|I watched this movie, I was watching Yes man with my girlfriend, and in the movie I saw the trailer for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.  I must say that this video touched me in a deep way. It was a very well done movie, it had a very heavy story to it. The thing about Benjamin is that his life is turned upside down, he starts with being old and then get younger and younger. I like the character of the video. It made me think as well. It made me think about my loved ones, how fast life goes by. Suddenly you are there in your death bed and you have lived your life.  The video got me inspired me, I am now attending a school of supernatural ministry in Redding CA, I watched the movie on my coach. I really enjoyed watching how the truth came out during the video and that life is full of surprises.  I will highly recommend  this video to anyone who wants to watch it, this movie will make you think.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is just superb on my Kindle Fire and is is just so entertaining. it is perfect and iis so addicting.
B005FMB8X6|4.0|I was college radio DJ from 78-82.  Prog rock was king of the (college) air waves.  Alan Holdsworth, Gentle Giant, Carlos Santana, Al DiMeola, Gong, Return to Forever, Brand X, Crack the Sky, etc. By '82 that sound was dying out. I do not remember hearing this album yet it sounds so familiar and I think the reason it does is that these licks and sounds had already been done many times over by the time it came out.  Still this is a stellar album from a technical aspect.  The playing is spot on and the production values (sound) are very high.  The real gem here is the DVD/DVDA of the album in 5.1/2.0 MLP and DTS.  The surround sound mix is fun but not very realistic in terms of an actual band playing in front of you.  Few 5.1 mixes are realistic in their soundstage.  The stereo mix in 24/96 via MLP is very good and primarily how I will listen to this disc.  Would not even have known about this special edition package if not for The Absolute Sound review in the February 2012 issue.  Tip o the hat to TAS.  Would have given this \\"record\\" 5 stars if they had muzzled Adrian Belew a bit more especially on the tracks that he just talks on as opposed to sings on.  This was edgy stuff back in the day.
1440503257|4.0|Not exactly as Harry-Potter  themed as I would have liked, but it still has quite a few interesting recipes and facts.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I get it.  The prequels are eh to say the least,  but it is still Star Wars.  If your not a fan of what this release has provided then dont buy it.  You new what you were gonna get if you already did buy it.  If you thought you were getting the original theatrical release of the 4,5, &, 6, you must be a knuckle head. Read the fine print before purchase.  I am sure you can pretty much consider the orginals a thing of the past.  I seriously doubt they will ever be release again.  Now that thats been said, it will come out, and of course I will shell out the dough for that as well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is so good I really love the audio the voice on it brings the words to life,I try to listen to it when ever I can. Thanks

B000C13Y2S|5.0|Tiny yet powerful. Useful for when you need a light in a small area but your nowhere near you usual flashlight. I have it on my keychain and I have used it a few times to look under my car seat or check under the sink in my dad's house when i wanted one right then and couldn't find one at that location.
B006OAB3ME|3.0|First of all, I love the Beatles and Paul McCartney. That being said this is the first Paul record that I haven't purchased in years(with the exception of instrumentals, etc). I just can't bring myself into buying it. I mean I work really hard for my money and a lot of it is just average nastalgia type of music. I will check it out from the library. Same goes for Ringo. Their time has passed.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|First of all...talk about fast shipping!!! 1 day. Supposed to be 2!!<br /><br />I bought the Phillips O'Neill Stretch headphones and I knew they would sound ok on my laptop and Droid 3 phone, but I figured I wouldn't be getting quite the sound out of them that I heard while testing them at a local store. I remember seeing something like this was available, so I hopped on to check reviews and pricing. There were cheaper amplifiers, but because of the positive reviews, I went with this one.<br /><br />OMG!!! Thank you reviewers!!! This thing turned my \\"slightly better than average\\" headphones into pure audiophile sound stages! I went from, \\"Cool sound.\\" to \\"HOLY BASS!!\\" I mean, this this is vibrating the crap out of my ears. There's way more power than these headphones can handle to, even when hooked up to my phone. If I crank the volume up on the amplifier, I'm unable to turn the volume up all the way on my phone because it creates nasty \\"I'm going to blow the speakers\\" kind of distortion.<br /><br />A couple things I noticed right away. You can charge and use the amplifier at the same time. This wasn't mentioned in other reviews I read, so I thought I'd point that out. Another thing is the directions clearly note that you have to hold the switch up for 3 second to turn the unit on and off. You use the same switch to switch EQ adjustments to 4 different settings (off, red, blue, red/blue). I play with it on just about every song. I think red is best if you're into bass, the red/blue is for people who do not want much bass or mid-tones at all. The other blue is for increased mid-tones, while off is flat.<br /><br />Anyway. I found this thing super easy to use. I plan to use the accompanying clip during a run at some point. I'm not sure how this flimsy plastic clip is going to do, but I guess we'll see. The clip is the only drawback, but not enough to keep me from buying it. What a great purchase. LOVE IT!!  I'm listening to my music using this thing as I type, and am still in disbelief with how much power this provides. Sounds unreal almost. I've got to watch a movie using this soon. Can't wait!!still in disbelief with how much power this provides. Sounds unreal almost. I've got to watch a movie using this soon. Can't wait!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's a very good game, I wish there were other games included like freecell and spider solitare as well. Keeps me entertained for hours.
0525478817|5.0|I read the copy belonging to my granddaugther. Highly recommended for all ages. Serious subject ( teens with terminal cancer) but funny and sharp as well as sad, and addresses some universal questions - the meaning of life, and whether there is oblivion at the end or something more; whether we should be aiming for the extraordinary, or whether an ordinary life lived well and with love is just as precious. And at the end of the book you will not want to say goodbye to those kids.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|For Christmas 2011, I got my 14 year old sister the three book, box set, of The Hunger Games.  After opening her present, she told me she'd read the first book for school and had really liked it.  She was happy to get the next two books and lent me the first one.  When I started the book, I was instantly reminded of a short story I read myself in school, The Lottery by Shirley Jackson.  In both stories, the community experiences loss by the unfortunate circumstance of a name being drawn. There are many similarities to these stories, however The Hunger Games blossoms into a tale where the reader is emotionally engaged and wanting more.  The story is told in first person, present tense, by the main protagonist, Katniss.  She is a strong, young woman, emotionally guarded, and the main care giver to her mother and younger sister.  They live in a post apocalyptic society that has been divided into 12 districts.  These districts are controlled by the Capitol.  Every year, the Capitol, in order to maintain dominance over the districts, hosts the Hunger Games, a brutal competition for survival of the fittest, where the last person standing wins.  The Hunger Games is to be televised for all to watch, entertainment for some, and a reminder to all of the power of the Capitol.  Once again, I found this book reminding me of a movie I once saw, The Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  If you can get past the cheese factor of the 80's and lots and lots of spandex, you will find this film tells the story of a man being put to his death after being wrongfully accused.  His death sentence is to be televised in a kind of arena-like, game show.  He is fighting for his life while world watches for entertainment.  Overall, I found this book to be engaging.  It was an easy read which flowed well and did not lag.  Characters such as Rue and Thresh invoked emotion, and I could really see the good in people even during the barbaric Hunger Games.  The protagonist, Katniss, and her fellowdistrict 12 companion, Peeta, were well paired as opposites, one wearing his heart on his sleeve and the other unable to open up and give herself a chance to feel.  I think the real power of this book is Katniss.  She is a strong, young female who finds herself in a terrible predicament and yet never backs down.  She is a great archer with real stamina who uses her knowledge and skills to survive often out witting or performing the other characters.  However, she is not cruel or backstabbing, and I can see a real kindness in her through her engagements with Rue and Prim.  She does not fall into the common stereotype of a love-sick, girly teen, who has to be cared for by her man.  On the contrary, she is the one who cares for Peeta who's struck with puppy love.  It's true at times Katniss can be guarded and may seem a little cold when it comes to self preservation, but her actions speak louder than words.  I also believe this story to be a good tool to open up dialog for younger readers.  This book speaks of the Capitol, a community plagued by the Cardinal Sins.  The Capitol has fallen victim to vanity, altering its inhabitants for unattainable perfection.  No one in the Capitol seems to know hunger or poverty.  Even the simplest of tasks are done for them by the Avox (a kind of servant).  There seems to be no concern for the people of the 12 districts, the people who provide the Capitol with everything they need.  In comparison to today, I would think the Capitol could be interchanged for The One Percent.  I am referring to the 2006 documentary by Jamie Johnson, who talks about the richest 1% of Americans who controlled 42.2% of the financial wealth of America in 2004.  Overall, I would recommend this book for young readers and adults.  The characters are written well and it's really nice to see a strong female character like Katniss really kick ass!  The book tells a good story, one mixed with right and wrong, making readers question what they would do if they found themselves caught as a tribute in the Hunger Games, victim to the Capitol.

B000XA5K48|5.0|What a wonderful piece of mind candy.  Just remember, this movie is a spoof -- a comedy.  A carrot-chomping, dark-souled hero (Clive Owen) who was national pistol champion at age ten?  Of course he's got to win against each and every bad guy.  Thus, with his first wave of thugs destroyed, the evil-doer (Paul Giamatti) hears that it's only going to be possible to scrape together another \\"fifty\\" to finish off the lone hero.  As something maybe akin to mockumentary, \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" takes what's real from the action thriller genre and creates a brilliant parody.  The action scenes, chases, gun-bursts, and all the effects seem as though they belong.  We might expect Charles Bronson, Steven Seagal, or Vin Diesel to appear at any moment.  Instead, Clive Owen carries the day, stuffing more than one baddie with a quick carrot through the brain.  Seriously!  Dozens more fall in various hails of gunfire or stunningly improvised booby traps.  A good many action-thriller cliches get taken over the top -- the bordello gunfights, the mutual redemption of the anti-hero and the fallen woman, a crusader politician who proves more than susceptible to betraying the cause, arms dealing, and the perpetual search for a truly safe hideout.  Of course, in this \\"mock-u-thriller\\" the love-making that seals the deal in the mutual redemption between our protagonists reaches its culmination in hail of gunfire with black-clad gunmen falling on all sides.  First, think Jack Nicholson's \\"Triumph\\" scene with Sally Struthers in \\"Five Easy Pieces.\\"  Then, turn the scene into a Ninja attack and allow Clive Own to use an automatic rifle as he swirls Monica Bellucci to ecstasy. For the double-dealing politician, \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" makes short work of the obligatory struggle on the chartered airliner.  Clive Owen pretty quickly takes the politician hostage, holding off Paul Giamatti and assorted thugs just long-enough to get into the cargo hold, where he plugs his hostage between the eyes and jumps into an extraordinary sky-diving gunfight, thus creating yet another labor shortage in the thug market.  A few last takes on these mock-u-thriller touches:  The tank on display in a military exhibition provides the safe house for Monica Bellucci and the infant, who is the real target of the thugs.  The \\"not-airlines-trains-ships-buses\\" escape for Bellucci and the child is cunningly labeled the bus to \\"Wherever.\\"  Clive Owen stays behind to kill off a final wave of thugs, the \\"super boss,\\" and Paul Giamatti  The happy reunion bringing Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, and their adopted infant back together takes place in the roadside restaurant where Bellucci and the infant have gone to ground -- in the midst of foiling a robbery attempt by a gang of seriously armed thugs.  Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, and Paul Giamatti are fabulous at carrying through straight-faced with their schtick.  What a treat.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|Ok so where do I begin???....... I Freaking Loved It!!! What more is there left to say?? Christen finally started to open up and let Ana touch him (can we say \\"break through\\"). Christen made my heart melt. Even though he still such a control freak, you know and can tell he absolutley adores Ana and would go to the end of the world and back for her!! (he just has a slightly different way of showing it) I love how Ana is still proving to be there for Christen and give him some of what he needs and still stand her ground and reamin true to herslf. He knows Ana is Not the one to be walked on. The sex is ABUNDANT in this book and gives you something to consider doing your self (lol). I really dnt know what else needs to be said, the book was well written, E.L. James has done it again with this amazing book and deserves a standing ovation and a round of applause!!!

0316017930|5.0|Gladwell's exposition of the context in which greatness occurs is at once mightily heartening and crushingly depressing. Heartening because we realize that successful people are made, not born, and any of us could be the next big force on the world stage. Depressing because it means we are subject to forces we cannot control, and cannot reverse if they impact us disadvantageously. Either way, it lets us plan for coming generations.<br /><br />Success, Gladwell says, doesn't come to particularly moral, industrious, or determined people. It comes to those placed, by individual circumstance and cultural context, in the right places. It comes to those prepared, like Bill Gates, who had unusual access to computers at a time when they were rare and cumbersome novelties. It comes to those aggressive in pursuing perfection, like the Beatles, whose Hamburg years served as a rock music boot camp.<br /><br />This does mean that even ambitious people won't necessarily succeed. I can't change my birthdate to come of age during some important cultural phenomenon. I can't change my roots to incorporate, for instance, the engineering demands of rural Chinese agriculture. But I can overthrow certain limitations: for instance, deference to authority, which might be nice at cocktail parties, where greater egalitarianism saves lives in crisis situations.<br /><br />Of course, there is still a place for individual initiative. Groundbreaking corporate lawyer Joe Flom was well placed by circumstances of birth, family, and opportunity, which got him in on the ground floor of Eighties-era cutthroat business. But he also embraced that opportunity, rather than letting it skid by. Gladwell does not disparage individual strengths, just places them in a situational framework.<br /><br />Gladwell does give hope, primarily to coming generations, in educational paradigms that empower children to overcome their limitations. I may not shed my WASPy upbringing and my specific range of opportunity, but I might prepare my kids for whatever opportunities might come their way. This puts boundaries around my future, which is a bit depressing, but it also means I don't have to pass those boundaries onto the next generation.<br /><br />This book is a poke in the eye to Ayn Rand types who want to believe we exist in a vacuum, standing or falling on our own virtues. And, as an educator, I find it quite exciting that I can open doors for others willing to walk through. We have the chance to provide coming generations with opportunities you and I never had. If we can stop lionizing individuals without recognizing their context, we have the chance to build a better world for our kids.portunities might come their way.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|actually engaging. some games are not quite made for touch screen gaming, but of a hundred probably ten are such. good app to kill time.
0439023513|5.0|I know many, many people aren't going to like the ending of this series. I'm fine with that. Not many like the reality. The rawness of the human emotion that is brought to life on page. Real life isn't pretty. War is despicable. But this book is amazing. Actually, it's the perfect end to this series. Collins lured me in with her amazingly descriptive writing, and kept me interested with the relationships, war, and continuance of the Games. All in all, a great read. I'm pleased I found this gem of a series.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|This is a masterpiece debut - comparisons to Tricky's Maxinquaye / Portishead / Badalamenti's Twin Peaks / Julie Cruise / Tori Amos are all valid, however this is a fresh take on all that has been done - that is why it is so enlightening.  Hip Hop, Trance, angst, marketing masterpiece, a gorgeous talented young woman who happens to have been born to wealth - it is all about the music,  this is amazing music - she has a great take on her vocals, lyrics are smashing, the entire album is a concept and she has IT.

1583334386|5.0|It isn't always fun to come to grips with the fact that we're not unique individual snowflakes. It is, however, empowering to read about people and situations that relate to me with remarkable accuracy. I love the way this book has examined every one of my failed efforts, and given insight to the physiology, and flawed psychology behind them. It's like the author knows my whole life story and is counseling me on better ways to approach my goals and habits. Way cheaper than a shrink, Thanks!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Watch the series and we were very pleased. The DVD's were not scratched and were secured in the cases so they were not rattling around. The whole family enjoyed our Dr. Quinn marathon.
B005GC8FKE|5.0|I'm not going to waste your time with a review about plot, or how well characters were developed, I will leave that to the guys who do that stuff for a living.<br /><br />If you like roller coaster rides then you will love this series, it will take you up, down, to the edge of your seat, white knuckled, cheering, and your heart racing!<br /><br />Probobaly the thing I liked best about this series was taking an ordinary man, and putting him in a situation where he felt he had to make difficult choices for, what he thought, was the good of his family. Instead he is thrown into a world he knows nothing about and where mistakes can mean death. He starts to unravel some of what it takes to survive in the brutal, ruthless world he has entered into and he realizes just how big a mistake his original decision was.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything for anyone other than to say that the story does end so you do have closure instead of being brought to the edge only to find out the series has been cancelled. I've had this happen so many times on shows, I felt, were excellent and had great potential like; Heroes, Journey man, John Doe, Stargate Universe, Farscape (although they did finally make a movie), Firefly, etc., etc.<br /><br />To me, it is disrespectful to the viewers who have stuck by and they deserve closure by allowing a few more runs just to allow an end to be made. If anything, they could make digital only releases for fans to buy at Amazon or other pay to view site.<br /><br />I really did enjoy this series and hated that it ended but was so glad that it did end and didn't leave me never knowing what happened next.<br /><br />Warning: The series is about drugs, the cartel, and so has some graphic violence and language. There is also nudity but it is what you would see in this dark world and nothing more.<br /><br />A big thanks to everyone who had a hand in this series. Job well done!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I recommend this to all families. It is a touching story and reaches out to all the fathers in the world.  Sometimes we get so caught up in our own lives that we forget we have others around us that we are suppose to take care of.  I found that once you change your focus you can do just about anything and this is what this movie is trying to portrait.  The courage to take on responsibility.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|I like the part with Jeremy Jones.... Glad to see they give a legend some credit for upping the original game.<br />Dont waste your life in a cube, living your dreams on the two weeks of vacation they give you a year, get out and live!

B006KX3GXO|4.0|I really enjoy this app. Its a great app not only for adults but my daughter enjoys it aswell. I recommend this app for everyone!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved this book so much I immediately ordered the author's other two books after finishing this one.  Andy Barber, Jacob's father, narrates the story of his son's indictment and trial for the stabbing murder of one of Jacob's classmates. The 14-year-old boys were enemies, but neither Andy nor Jacob's mother can conceive of Jacob as a murderer. Sure, when Jacob was a pre-schooler, kids seemed to get hurt somehow when they were around him, and there is a rumor that he buried one of the neighbor's dogs -- but he's a great kid!  Right?  So when Andy finds out that Jacob secretly obtained a knife, he felt no compunction about disposing of it in the wake of the murder since it could not possibly be the murder weapon. After all, a boy Jacob's age should not possess such a weapon. Further, Andy is the District Attorney who will ultimately bring the case to trial, and his investigator has discovered a pedophile with a predilection for young teen boys living near where the murdered boy was found. But Andy's ambitious second-in-command convinces their boss to put Andy on leave since he is convinced the evidence is beginning to point to Jacob.  I can't say much more without giving away some of the very unexpected plot twists awaiting the reader. What I can say is that I found the character development to be rich and believable, especially for Andy. And the book's ending was so surprising and pleasurable to me that I reread it several times, appreciating the author's skill in bringing all the story threads together for a walloping conclusion. Five stars for sure.

0525422943|2.0|So I approached WHERE SHE WENT with almost equal amounts trepidation and excitement. It's hard to follow up an ending like the ending of [[ASIN:014241543X If I Stay]]. In many respects, I felt like the mere existence of a sequel might mar the beauty of the first book. I just . . . I loved how it ended so much, I wasn't at all sure I wanted to know what happened next. And if you know me at all you know how hilarious that sounds. I always want to know what happens next. I regularly fill my life with beloved series I can't quit. But I am also an enormous admirer of standalone volumes, particularly those featuring a judicious and perfect ending. Such was the case with [[ASIN:014241543X If I Stay]]. But the tenor of my emotions for Mia and Adam by the end of that book ensured that I wouldn't be able to stay away from a follow-up in the end. Especially as that follow-up was set three years later. So I only lasted about 24 hours in between finishing the first book and plunging into the second.<br /><br />A warning: If you have not yet read [[ASIN:014241543X If I Stay]], I suggest doing so now before proceeding any farther. It really is worth it, and there is simply no way to discuss the sequel without ruining the surprise both books have in store. Also, the nature of my feelings regarding this one demand a discussion of the ending. So. You have been warned, yes?<br /><br />It's been three years since Mia awoke to find Adam there waiting for her. And, as happy as she was to see him (and he her), it turns out three years is more than enough time for everything to fall apart. At first, everything seemed fine. More than fine. She was awake. She was alive. She had Adam there to help her through her recovery and convalescence. She had an acceptance letter from Julliard. But none of those positives were enough in the end. They weren't enough to outweigh the loss of her family. They weren't enough to keep Mia in the town where it all happened a moment longer than she had to stay. And, though neither of them could have seen it coming, they were not enough to sustain her relationship with Adam. So Mia makes the command decision to break things off entirely and leave, leaving behind an utterly demolished and dumbstruck Adam. Over the course of the next three years, both of their lives change beyond measure, as Mia embarks on the concert career she's always wanted, and Adam is skyrocketed to stardom in a whirlwind of success and good fortune. But time catches up with them. And when they both find themselves in New York over the same 24-hour period, they are forced to deal with the detritus that is all that remains of who they once were.<br /><br />WHERE SHE WENT is the opposite of [[ASIN:014241543X If I Stay]] in every way. Where [[ASIN:014241543X If I Stay]] was quiet and elegantly somber, WHERE SHE WENT is chaotic and jaggedly painful. Where [[ASIN:014241543X If I Stay]] was told from Mia's self-contained, removed perspective, WHERE SHE WENT is told from Adam's very different point of view. And, unfortunately, where [[ASIN:014241543X If I Stay]] has a breathtaking ending, WHERE SHE WENT has an ending that left me with my mouth hanging open at how inadequate it was. I know it was the ending so many readers were hoping for, and the truth is I wanted that ending as well. Especially after I followed Adam around and watched with such sadness the person he had become, my heart practically bursting with sympathy for him. I loved Adam so much in this book. It's his story in every sense of things, and it's written incredibly well. I soaked up his version of events and how he never got over Mia and how all the riches life deposited in his lap weren't enough to compensate for the loss of love and friendship. Full of rage, sadness, and basically every negative, hurt emotion I can think of, he absolutely steals the show. Enter Mia and everything that has happened to her in the intervening years. I loved the setup, and I loved how it was simultaneously easyto be together again and awkwardly ruinous at the same time. From their halting physical proximity to their loaded verbal exchanges, everything was handled so well. I couldn't wait to get to the culmination of things and the inevitable decision they would have to make. And this is where we come to the inadequacy. I wanted that ending, but not this way. Not at the expense of my respect for the characters. After all of that, all of the thought and heartbreak and complexity that went into these two people who loved each other as kids and have surmounted tragedy to become adults all on their own, how could it wrap up so easily? How could either of them be satisfied with the meager resolution that was proffered? I wasn't. I wanted more for Adam and more from Mia, and that's all there is to it. All of that excruciating growth and hard-earned experience deserved more than a token apology on her part and a grateful acceptance on his. It was too fast, too simple, and too saccharine even for my romantic heart. I ended it in dismay, wishing it wasn't so. In other words--the exact opposite of how I felt at the end of [[ASIN:014241543X If I Stay]]. Each reader's reaction will be different, of course (see a myriad other reviews). This was mine and mine alone. I'm so very glad Mia chose to stay. I just really wish I hadn't found out where she went.ardly ruinous at the same time.

B0068TL23G|5.0|I love love love this game.  I hate hate hate this game.  Great brain teaser.  Problem is it is so new there are no cheats on YouTube yet.  LOL  Highly recommended.
014241543X|4.0|It was all the hype surrounding the release of [[ASIN:0525422943 Where She Went]] that actually got me interested in reading IF I STAY. I was aware of the love it received upon its publication a couple of years ago. But even though it appeared to be universally loved, I never picked it up, as I tend to be somewhat leery of coma/out of body experience stories. It's not that I've read a ton of them, but in the few that I have read, I've had a hard time connecting to the main character. What with them being . . . well, comatose and all. So I'd pretty much decided I wasn't going to try this one, until the blogosphere had a collective meltdown over there being a sequel at all and then at how awesome it apparently was. You know how hard it is to resist that promise of a sequel that lives up to (possibly even surpasses) its predecessor. I'm certainly not able to hold out against it for long. So I snagged a copy of IF I STAY and ignored my niggling concerns to see just what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Mia comes from a musical family. From her ex-rocker dad and groupie mom to her adorable drummer of a little brother, her family has music in its bones. And Mia does, too. But not in exactly the same way. You see, Mia loves classical music. She's a dedicated cellist and just waiting for that acceptance letter to Julliard. Her loving family supports her passion, if they remain a bit bemused at how straitlaced and determined she is. Then the unthinkable happens. Mia wakes up to find she's been in a car crash. Her entire family was in the car, and now she's in a coma and her parents and brother are . . . gone. From a foggy distance, Mia watches life go on and alternates between watching her body in the hospital and flashbacks to life before the crash, to her relationships with her family members and with her sweet musician boyfriend Adam. What will happen, Mia is not sure. Is there anywhere to go from here? Is she stuck in an eternal in-between? And most importantly, will she ever have the chance to tell her loved ones how much they meant to her?<br /><br />My emotions about IF I STAY have not faded over time. It's a monumentally quiet story, and the reader drifts along with Mia on a gently wistful refrain of loss. In fact, it's so quiet and gentle that it borders on bland. Which is not to say that I didn't like Mia and Adam and the rest. I did. Very much. And I'm not sure what I was expecting, but what I got was much lower key than that. The writing was competent and unobtrusive, the characters sympathetic, and the situation (naturally) absolutely heartbreaking. But I wasn't consumed. I wasn't so attached that I couldn't put it down. But I kept reading because I did feel fond of these characters, and I really did want to find out how Gayle Forman would resolve Mia's story. And here's where things get interesting, my friends. Because IF I STAY has the best ending I've read in some time. And I am not even a little bit joking. I am seven kinds of serious when I say that this book ramps up to one humdinger of a climax. It was so good it took my breath away. And it sneaks up on you like nobody's business, so that when it does happen you immediately look back on the whole in wonder. Because it really was more than the sum of its parts. It was one of those not just a good ending, but the only one, you know? And all I could think was how well-crafted it was, how seamless and inconspicuous, how softly it crept, all so that you could experience the sheer magnitude of that ending. Honestly, I was just so impressed. It was the perfect ending, and truthfully I wasn't sure at all that I wanted a sequel. Which is actually how you ought to feel after finishing any book, isn't it? Bravo, Ms. Forman.ve the chance to tell her loved ones how much they meant to her?  My emotions about IF I STAY have not faded over time.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I have been looking for headphones for running... took a chance on these because of all the reviews. They are fantastic. I love customer feedback on Amazon!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game definetly a must get game my only isssue with the app is that the more games u get.the more expensive they are
B006UG90RM|5.0|The bottom line is the band we all love and are just happy to hear is finally here! Why these so called \\"old school\\" fans insist on finding something negative in something that is obviously making tons of fans happy?  Come on people it's a party rock band not Dream Theater,why do you have to disect note by note and crap on everything? Just embrace and relish this release such that it may be their last.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|I guess it's kind of fitting considering drakes persona is one of confliction, that i find myself liking this album when there are a plethora of reasons that i shouldn't. Unless i'm mistaken this record runs for nearly 80 minutes and in that time you hear the voice of a man who is sickeningly self obsessed, shamelessly needy and by all accounts emotionally immature and i've walked away from this record feeling some genuine sense of satisfaction from having heard it. Funnily enough i don't really have an answer as to why drakes personality flaws haven't resulted in me going to town on this, other than maybe he is all those things, but somehow his refreshingly self aware and unapologetically honest way of expressing himself is redemptive? Either way i'm charmed and i can't pretend otherwise.<br /><br />There's more to the story than drakes wining/womanising of course and thats the music, which is by most accounts fantastic. We have \\"40\\" to thank as well as drake for creating a sound that is equals part soulful and minimalist. This is best exempliflied by opener \\"over My Dead Body and \\"Marvins Room\\" where there is little more than a simple chord progression on the piano and some reverberated electronic sounds throughout with drake singing/rapping almost in accapella and in the latter it's even sparser than that, where the music feels positively claustrophic. Replacing any instruments with similar elctronic sounds and the voice of an annonymous girl on the phone, who he's shamelessly attempting to convince she'd be better off leaving her husband and being with him \\"F that N that you love so bad\\", whilst in the same verse acknowledging how cliched he sounds \\"I'm just sayin', you could do better, tell me have you heard that lately?\\".<br /><br />What's really impressive about this album is how they've managed to sequence these spared down songs with the occasional banger \\"lord knows\\" the four four beat of \\"Take Care\\" and a roots-esque interlude \\"Buried Alive\\" without it seeming sporadic or out of place. The balance of eclecticism and sparsity is something few artists could pull off so effortlessly and for that this should be given a lot of credit for it's success. When Drake goes into full on R&B mode especially when The Weeknd is accompanying him, the music can suffer a little as it's starts to feel decaedent and self indulgent. There is more than one occasion where i winced wtih the song \\"Good One's Go\\" which feels like a throwback to Joe thomas at his most cringeworthy.<br /><br />The Hip Hop R&B fusion is nothing new but Drake has managed to make his contemporaries sound dull, unimaginative and unambitious in comparison. If he continues to grow as a songwriter hopefully towards topics that feel less navel gazing and more relatable, he could become a great artist. As it currently stands he's still the only \\"pop superstar\\" making music right now that i would care to return to. I would openly recommend this album to those who shun pop music and tend to find it lacking. There's a wealth of solid material on this, that i'd say any music fan should check out.<br /><br />Take Care ;)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is boss! it makes me go psycho with the level of.competition it brings to the table, but imma beast!! #(:
0553801473|2.0|I enjoyed the first three books and found it hard to put them down. The last two are crap in comparison and I think we have another writer just padding the coffers. Remember Steven Kings \\"The Gunslinger\\" series. The last book of that series was a major disappointment also. I am not even looking forward to the next release, if there is one, as most of the interesting characters have already been killed off. I don't really see the reason for spending the time to meet a new group of second rate characters as this series progresses into what would be better used as toilet paper.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I found that this game was more fun when I first got it but after like two weeks it got boating and I didn't want to play as often but when u get the free points it's more fun!!O$NAP!!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I love this package! Totally worth the money, and the first few movies look amazing on Blu-ray! definitely worth it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game, the ads are a little annoying. But you can skip them with one touch. I recommand this game.
0375420525|5.0|If you like intellectual books then I would suggest this. Danielewski is a fantastic author. As I mentioned in the title, this is my all time favourite book. It will make you think but it also keeps you entertained. Especially if you love interviews, puzzles, and mysteries.
1400052181|4.0|In reading this book, I kept having to remind myself that the research of cells, the ethical discussions, the research, the knowledge has all happened within the past few decades.  I was living right through these momentous discussisons and knew nothing of cellular research.  How can such important information escape the educated, albeit non-scientific reader?  Not only informative, but this book was well written, consisting of partly Henrietta's biography, partly historical research, and partly commentary on the contemporary family.  What was striking was the contrast between the advances of science and the continuing ignorance, distrust, superstition, and disinformation of Henrietta's descendents.  The author did a good job documenting these two themes, resulting in conflicting feelings of scientific hope and sociological despair.  It makes good reading and should be part of an undergraduate reading list.
0525478817|4.0|I am a pretty huge Nerdfighter and John Green fan so I pre-ordered this book. I had no idea what it was about when I pre-ordered it, I just trusted because it was from John Green that it would be good....and I was right! This book certainly had some sad moments and certainly had some funny ones, but there were a lot of very quoteable and moving parts to this book too. I actually picked it up and took it with me to read while my dad was in the hospital having a surgery to remove his cancer. Call it perfect timing! If you are a fan of John Green or just want some good reading I'd suggest this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game. I downloaded it for use on my wife's Transformer tablet. It works very well and is very responsive. I am impressed with its operation.
1594203334|3.0|French living in the US since 7 years and mom of 2 wonderul kids I undertand what the author is trying to say. But please be careful, like anything there is no perfect way to raise your child since each of them are different.  Trust your instinct - don't read much books as I find them somethimes missleading and source of unwanted and not needed anxiety. The best way to raise your children? Love them and listen to your heart.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|If you don't mind some soft-Hentai in your story line, then you won't be distracted from really liking this Anime zombie series - good artwork, funny where it works, and the story line will pull you in to the extent you forget it's just Anime.  Very happy to have this on my \\"all things zombie\\" shelf.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is a MMORPG that requires you to have an internet connection available to play. This game mimics quite a bit of WoW, but it's quite a feat that they have done such a great job on the Kindle Fire. The controls work very well, and the character development is spot on. I have actually been playing this more than WoW since I've pretty much done everything in the last expansion, and this gives me new places to explore. It's not better than WoW, but it's pretty darn good especially considering the format. You can buy gems and gold in the game using money, but it is not necessary at all to play the game and get everything out of it, it just saves you some grinding. also, the subscription will run you about $6 a year, that's cheap. Highly recommended if you like MMORPG's.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game. could play this 101- in 1 games for hours. but there is one thing that I do not like and that is that you have to have so much money to buy the games.
0099908506|3.0|Largely biographical, Fiesta is about a group of American men in Paris and their entanglements with Brett Ashley, an English socialite, who has a complex love relationship with protagonist Jake Barnes.  Hemingway's non-committal style and spare prose leaves Jake in control of the narrative of which he is central but unobtrusive, revealing less about the events (which take them to the Spanish Fiesta) in the book than about Jake himself. Jake may be tacit in his narration, but the reader pieces together his frustrated feelings for Brett in a relationship that cannot be consummated, and her insatiable need to do just that by proxy with other men.  In the background, the dispiritedness and displacement of Jake and his friends reflective of Americans like Hemingway who found themselves drifting in the post-war years searching for meaning in European cities (called `The Lost Generation' by Gertrude Stein). This is a novel about love and loss, as much as it is a document of Paris in the 1920s.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like playing these GAMES! I have fun winning points to &quot;buy&quot; more games  it even lets you earn points if you come back days in a row.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|On occasion a writer's style, coupled with an interesting subject matter, resonates deep within.  This is one such book.  The characters were vivid, the story compelling, educational and a pure joy to read start to finish.  If you enjoy running, adventure, personal discovery, this book is for you.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I would highly recommend this! Very helpful and accurate.  One of the first things I downloaded and glad I did!
B002KAOSEW|1.0|Scumbag Left Wing Nutjob garbage.  Lee Child again shows what a douche he is and proves he knows absolutely nothing about how military people think.  He actually says that military people think of their wounded as \\"garbage\\".  He turns the whole book into nothing more than a big anti-military rant.
B005FITIK0|5.0|I always wondered what happens to mean girls as they grow up through the years.  Looking at social networking sites now, I get the answer! They have either found \\"God\\" and bear children or they drink ALOT which you can tell due to their aging faces. Not cute anymore huh? Charlize's character Mavis in this movie went the way of booze and never growing out of her incredulous teenager. This is where it gets sad, enter Patton Oswalt and his emasculated and trauma carrying character. His character is what brings life to this movie he's the protagonist to the Mavis antagonist. This movie left me with a weird feeling that loomed long after I left the theatre. It brings back high school memories and all its extremes, the good and the bad. This is the first movie that shows it with brutal and awkward honesty. Thank you Ms. Cody!

1609611543|5.0|Absolutely must-read book for those with odd combinations of symptoms that persist over long periods of time!  In my case, two previous tests for gluten allergies turned up negative, but a new test, Cyrex Labs Array #3, found the issues, and along with Dr. Davis's explanation of the DNA of modern wheat provided the basis for curing 17 years of almost-daily migraines.  Davis has found that a long list of common ailments from arthritis to MS, and disorders like migraines to thyroid issues can be correlated with wheat consumption -- the list of ailments goes on and on, including perhaps 10% of the population according to Davis.  Thanks to the information in \\"Wheat Belly\\" I've not only stopped eating gluten, I feel best with absolutely no wheat at all!  Big thanks of gratitude to Dr. Davis for the effort he put into writing \\"Wheat Belly\\"!!  This book should be read by every physician, no matter his/her specialty!

B0019N8P2W|3.0|I bought Daria: The Complete Animated Series because I love the show. It was a great deal, arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the packaging was appropriated. These are the only positive things about this order. While the quality of the picture is perfect and there are no flaws (that i can see) on the disks themselves the DVDs keep skipping the episodes around. Not just the episodes but also parts of the episodes are out of order. I'd select one episode and it would start playing a complete different episode. Or when the right episode was finally selected it would sometimes start in the middle or after an episode actually played correctly after the credits it would restart back in the middle. I know it cannot be the DVD player itself couldn't be the problem because it was purchased in December and is still new. I gave the product 3 starts solely based on the fact that I love the show and it does sometimes work properly. I guess you get what you pay for.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it so far, nice to have a variety of games. ads do suck, but not sure why people complain you can barely watch youtube videos without ads these days
B00011CZRE|5.0|Seven is a must own if you love thrilling movies with a twist. Seven stars Morgan freeman as William Somerset and Brad Pitt as David Mills, as well as Kevin Spacey as the murderer. Freeman and Pitt are Homicide investigators for a police department in a nasty crime-ridden city. The movie centers around the \\"seven deadly sins\\" as found in catholicism and famously, the book Dante's Inferno. Each murder they investigate centers around these seven deadly sins: Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Pride, Lust, and last but certainly not least in this movie is Envy. The movie is exciting, thrilling and very suspenseful and leaves you shocked at its conclusion. Brad Pitt and Morgan freeman are great, and Spacey only adds to the awesomeness. Highly recommended and a must see for fans of thriller-suspense-murder mystery movies.
0756405890|5.0|I originally planned to catch up on my to-read list this year, but when I received an Amazon gift card for Christmas I had to pick up the first two books in the Kingkiller Chronicles.<br /><br />While in the process of reading four other books, I made the mistake of checking out The Name of the Wind. Yeah... I couldn't stop! It threw me for a loop. I've read plenty of good books lately, but none have grabbed me liked this one. That first night, I lost a couple much-needed hours of sleep just to satisfy my curiosity. If you couldn't guess by now, I loved it.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind begins in third person and switches to first as we hear the story of Kvothe, the main character. Rothfuss makes it an easy transition. We learn from the beginning that Kvothe is an intelligent kid. He's lead into a series of nasty events that leave him in a life and death situation for much of the first half of the book. He uses his wit to guarantee his survival.<br /><br />I've read plenty of other reviews claiming Rothfuss spends too much time on tangents that take away from the story (a common complaint for epic fantasy). I never felt this once. Every scene fit, if only to teach us more about the characters and their morality. The flow from excitement to depth began on the first page.<br /><br />I read another review complaining about the lack of personality from the female characters. I can see how this may be true for some, but I personally found the main love interest to be one of the most unique characters I've read about. Multiple scenes displayed the intricacies of her personality.<br /><br />A favorite aspect of The Name of the Wind was the new school of magic Rothfuss created. It reminded me of Brandon Sanderson's ability to produce a new and distinct kind of magic. Rothfuss planned it out well and details its properties using magical, but more often, scientific reasoning. Those who enjoy the world and magic building process will be happy with what Rothfuss has to offer in his first book.<br /><br />If somebody forced me to pick something I didn't like, I can only think of one possibility. There are two minor characters who spend a lot of time together and I had a tough time distinguishing between the two. Rothfuss might have been able to make each more unique as to set them apart. I hate to mention it because it wasn't really a big deal. I just remember some of their interactions being the only time I felt pulled from the story.<br /><br />A great book and creative enough to set itself apart from others in the genre.something I didn't like, I can only think of one possibility.

B00005JNEW|5.0|Friday Night Lights is a 2004 drama film which documents the coach and players of a high school football team and the Texas city of Odessa that supports and is obsessed with them. The movie follows the story of the 1988 Permian High School Panthers football team as they made a run towards the state championship for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State championship against Carter High School from Dallas, but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with -- or alludes to -- a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.<br />The coach, Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), is constantly in the hot seat. Tied to the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player and running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles (Derek Luke) who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) struggles with being able to play consistently. Fullback Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) has a rocky relationship with his father (Tim McGraw), who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer (Lee Thompson Young), who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury. His obsession with fame and recognition also comes at a high price that he is at first not ready to pay. Safety Brian Chavez (Jay Hernandez) is easily the second smartest player on the team, and the most confident in his future after high school football. One of the themes of the movie depicts the coach as a father-type figure for the players.<br />Coach Gaines triumphs and struggles with winning football games and connecting with his players a number of times during their tremulous season. His job depends on the Panthers making the playoffs, and his team is in a three-way tie with two other teams at the end of the regular season. Under Texas rules for ties, the tiebreaker is a coin-toss. Permian gets a spot. They make it to the finals, where they narrowly lose against a powerhouse Dallas high school team. The movie ends with the coach removing the departing seniors from the depth chart on his wall. Notably, the depth chart has \\"Case\\" at quarterback. This refers to Permian's real-life backup quarterback in 1988, Stoney Case, who would go on to lead Permian, along with Chris Comer, to the 5A state title the following year, and still later made it to the NFL. The final scene consists of Winchell throwing a football to a bunch of pee-wees playing pick-up football before leaving with Billingsley and Chavez.t rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury.

B0043W7NYM|2.0|Was anyone else distracted by the plethora of italicized words in every paragraph (especially in the dialogue)? Just me? I found it super obnoxious nonetheless...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I was excited to get this game because it looked like it had a lot of classics.  I was a little disappointed thoguh because the games are VERY low quality, it is still good entertainment though
B0001ARCFA|4.0|These are good, i have k271mkII and k-240 and Sennheiser 518 and many small ones, the K 240 has better bass and and 518 is much better, but little compromising on the rest. The 271 is awesome on everything except the lows, i mean if you are a rock and roll and classic guy these will be good, but if you are a sort of a person who wants a little more bass bang the 240 are good, and the Sennheiser 518 sound completely different they are good too, but i find the 271 more crisp and clear. And ya they are made in China which kind of ruins the whole wow part, they are comfortable, i like the detachable cable part.
0062082353|5.0|This was an incredible book. It really gives you details not found in other military books out there. Well written and well thought out. He's the kind of person we need defending this country.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game contains many great features. With one touch, you can move the cards to their correct place. A great classic.
B001NLKWLW|3.0|I love long novels but this is dragged out unnecessarily and predictable. I read a few books a month and would not be able to recommend this one. I dont know why the reviews are so good.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Well I know I am a little late but I did not watch the first Twilight until November 2011. I borrowed the first 3 from a friend and watched all of them back to back one Sunday afternoon. I never thought I would like them but I do and I can't wait to read the books (I am waiting till Breaking Dawn 2 comes out). I would have to say this is one of my favorites of the first 3. The action scene at the end of the movie is great. Even my roomate (who is a guy) likes to watch this one. I am glad I ordered it through Amazon it was cheaper than Wal-Mart or Target.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This program.works very well. The streaming frame rate is low but sound is perfect and the controls are surprisingly efficient. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to stream screens.
B004KAB5QO|5.0|I love Ghost stories and this is one that is not only well written, but when the teller of the tale pauses I found myself hurrying through the book in order to find out what happened next!!! I found myself hoping that nothing happened to the listener of the tale and even the teller, thinking that maybe the things that went bump in the night would by-pass them! Excellent book in my opinion!!!! I will read more from this author I have bought her \\"The Woman in Black\\" and can't wait to read it!!!!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Ok I admit it, when word first began to leak out about a new Van Halen album, one that miracle among miracles would feature Diamond Dave, I had my doubts. Could you blame me? After all, it was rock's worst kept secret how much acrimony had existed between Eddie Van Halen and David Lee Roth since Roth had left the band in 1985. If anything, the ensuing years only seemed to prove that things hadn't changed. Sure, Van Halen went on to have even more success with Sammy Hagar, while Diamond Dave had an ok but unspectacular solo career, but the likelihood of the original band ever recording again? A snowball not melting in hell seemed more likely than that.  Of course, there was another acrimonious break up (Hagar left the band in 1996, and then original bassist Michael Anthony), and Eddie's well known continuing drug and alcohol problems, as well as seemingly failing health. These events seemed to permanently put Van Halen (despite the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction) into the permanent place of most legendary bands: the occasional reunion tours (and there have been a few) to sold out crowds of fans who long for the days when rock and roll was actually fun and had actual bands that kids like me grew up wanting to be. The idea of a band like Van Halen coming out with anything noteworthy in 2012 (considering the guys were in their late 50s/early 60s) was hardly something to be taken seriously. I admit, I was getting sick and tired of all the rumors that began circulating about recording sessions, and new music coming out, only to find out that it was just a tease.  That's what makes 'A Different Kind of Truth' such a shock to the system. What immediately struck me was how hard this album ROCKS. There is nary a ballad or a keyboard to be found anywhere. A remarried, clean and sober Eddie plays his guitar with a ferocity that hasn't been heard since at least '1984'. Diamond Dave may not have the voice that yelped and screeched like the Van Halen of old, but on this album his vocals fit like a well worn pair of jeans, he doesn't try to over sing, and the trademark smart ass lyrics are still in heavy supply. While Michael Anthony's distinctive high harmony vocals are missed, Eddie's son Wolfgang is a more than competent bassist, so Anthony's absence is hardly noticed.  The album opening 'Tattoo' was an obvious first single choice, and probably the 'safest' song on the record, which features a great laid back groove and catchy lyrics about 'sexy dragon magic'. 'She's the Woman' might be recognizable to die hard VH fans as an earlier form of another classic (Mean Street). This was one of the bands early demos they cut after they were first signed, with Roth reworking some of the lyrics. Another song that fans might recognize a familiar riff (and this writer's personal fave) is 'Stay Frosty' which is basically 'Ice Cream Man' on steroids and features Roth musing about the world of preachers and other 'advice givers'. Another standout track is 'You and Your Blues' where Dave name checks some classic blues songs 'no Red House over yonder, no Stormy Monday blues' and sings about being brought down by someone who is a classic 'Debbie Downer' type.  There are some incredibly aggressive, fast paced rockers like 'As Is', 'China Town', and 'Honeybabysweetiedoll' which feature Eddie's trademark lightning fast riffing, the last of which goes by so fast, you almost miss it. He seems clearly inspired, and Roth seems to have brought out Eddie's inner id, which clearly had been missing on Van Halen's last few albums. Even at almost 60 years old, he still sounds and plays like no one else.  Whether or not this album leads to more music remains to be seen, but it's nice to know that in 2012 despite the 'gloominess' of the current rock scene that some old timers can show the young kids how you REALLY rock. After all, it's supposed to be fun!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a really good app but I hate the fact more than half the time it says I have to redownload from the amazon store.
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather has been accurate on  the weather the majority of the time -would consider it very reliable.  easy to use and to navigate through features.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|im writing this on my kindle so i'm going to keep this short.  im amazed by the research Dawkins includes in this book. he puts it in such a well formed and structured way that allows the information to flow straight to the reader. its alsk clear to see that Dawkins offers an unbiased and clear analysis of religion overall.  my hope is that many will finally open their minds and pick up this title. it is a fantastic read and i can barely put it down!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This is one of the best looking Blu rays I've seen.  I watched this with a 2d to 3d and it's perfect.  Like being there.  This is a great looking performance.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I really enjoy playing these games especially when I have to wait and wait at practices, doctors and dentists office, and in many other scenarios as well.  My only complaint is that I've killed off all the pigs in Level 5 of 'Summer Picnic' TWICE (2011 Seasons) and believe me it wasn't that easy, but both times I got a &#34;Level 5 Failed&#34; message??????  Is this game rigged sometimes to cheat?
B006PZBR8S|1.0|so predictable it is not even worth watching, it starts out his robot kicks butt then gets creamed and the same with the 2nd robot, then he gets his kid for the summer and the kids robot takes a beating but always ends up winning until the final event is the judges decision. Of course as predictable as ever the kids robot won but the decision is for the bad robot, lol
B0071T5PN0|5.0|I've been an over the top Van Halen fan since 1978 and have listened to the first 6 albums over and over and over again. I've been waiting for the release of this record for years and for me it was well worth the wait. I, like many others, was disappointed when I went on YouTube to see and hear the single \\"Tattoo\\". My first thought was \\"You mean I waited all this time for this crap\\"? I was hesitant to shell out any cash for A Different Kind Of Truth but then thought what the hell, it IS Van Halen. I popped the cd in as soon as I got in the car, skipped the first track and then proceded to get my socks rocked off. I realize they took 4 old demos, (She's The Woman, Outta Space, Big River, Beats Workin') and updated them with new lyrics and solos but so what? If that's what they needed to do to get back to basics then it worked! It seems to me the other tracks were written in the same vein and the fact that there are no keyboards anywhere on the album tells me they wanted to get back to grass roots. Eddie and Alex have never sounded better and Wolfie does an excellent job on the bass as well as back vocals. Diamond Dave seems like he's straining at times but can still hold his own. All in all this record kicks total ass! Even Tattoo, listened to in the context of the entire album is starting to grow on me, (kinda like Jump did back in 1984). Anyone who bashes this album is not a true Van Halen fan. Period. Go out and buy this album, I promise you won't regret it!
B006W0QOF2|4.0|Ryan Gosling did a wonderful job in this film a man of principle in this film. The character was well scripted, a man with his own direction, purpose and rules in life. This is a Kind of a \\"quiet hero\\" film, a little different from the generic run of the mill Hollywood movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once you start you will not put it down. I really enjoyed the entire three book set. There is also a movie coming out this year on book 1 I can't wait to see it!

0439023521|5.0|The book is fast-paced and a quick read so it really is hard to put the book down. I read it on a flight and was thoroughly entertained the entire way through. I had heard wonderful things about it, and it truly reached my expectations.
B0064T6LV8|2.0|I downloaded it and it didn't work :C But i have a feeling that it would be fun if it worked for me. I loved pinball space cadet in my brothers old windows XP comp!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Just listen to this album without bias.  Trust me, it took me at least five times through to do it, but after I did...INCREDIBLE is all I have to say.  Twenty eight years between albums (no, Van Haggar and Van Cherone do NOT count) this is amazing.  Has Diamond Dave's vocals aged, yes, but like a fine wine, and good rock and roll, it has just added that vintageness to it. Eddy and Alex keep rockin' (and thanks Eddy for coming back to the hard rockin' side) and Wolfgang, bless you, you help fill in the band.  Those who expected '1985' need to consider the hard road this band has taken to get to their seventh album.  After a 28 year hiatus I (and we as fans) could not have asked for more.  Thank you Van Halen, another gem to add to your (and our) collection!  I, like many of your fans, hope you have much more in your tank and will be cranking out the tunes for years to come.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I really did not like this game I thought it was boring and when I did play it felt like you could onlybplay for ten minutes before u got bored.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a super fun game, having to earn the other games makes it that more enjoyable. Earning all the points make it worth it.

0553582038|1.0|I love Arya, I love Tyrion, I love Jon, I love Dany. They are my friends and my heroes, I want to know what happens with them and I want to see them have a fate that is unlike all the other main characters that have died so far.  Instead of finding out about my friends, I get this steaming pile of paper which is about none of them. This book is misery tourism: a bunch of miserable characters with screwed up minds riding through a ravaged miserable land filled with miserable people. There are no real redeeming features here other than finding out how wretched all the supporting characters from the previous three books were. There is so little plot advancement that this book should never have been written. Just like the movie Signs, this is a perfect example as to why so few successful stories are based around secondary characters who have no real role to play in the events unfolding around them: it's BORING.  I'm good at sticking with books, but I couldn't even bring myself to finish this thing. And after the little research I've done to see what it is I'm still missing, I won't.
B003XSSR4W|5.0|This is one of the deserted island album of all time as it is that good. The songs were written with so much care and poignant lyrics makes this Bad Finger album right up there with any other apple record releases. It is with such tragedy that two of the band member had paased away without enjoying the fruit of their labor. I can't help but to think that this band may have made several more classic albums like this if no one had died and were surrounded by people who cared and not the vultures of music management at that time. We are very fortunate that this album is available to us after decades of unavailability. I love Bad Fingers and always will.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let me start by saying that I've never been one to actually pick up a book let alone finish it. But I kept hearing great things about this series and had to try it myself. From the beginning it held my attention. I could barely put it down. Its so interesting and keeps you wanting more the whole time. Like I said, I NEVER read....and I read this book in about 3 days. I think that says it all. Great read and can't wait to start the others! AND THE MOVIE!! :)
B006UG90RM|4.0|....that I like this album a lot. It's defintely better than anything put out since 5150. My greatest fear was that DLR would ruin this album by trying to write lyrics and sing the songs like it is still 1984. Though there are some parts that are still vintage DLR, like the spoken lyrics within the middle of a song or the \\"ow\\" and \\"woohoo\\", he tends to keep this to a minimum which is good (not that his tendency to do these things is bad but overdone it becomes distracting and even corny). Another thing I'm glad is on the most part the lyrics are directed towards a more mature audience. I was afraid DLR would try to pick up where 1984 lefted off and write songs directed towards the 20 somethings. In someways he did but again this is kept to a minimum. As far as the music Eddie is on the top of his game if not sounding better than he ever did. His guitar has a rawer, harder sound then all VH's releases since Fair Warning. Alex sounds like he has perfected the double bass on the drums which would bring the songs more into the modern hard rock/metal era. As far as Eddie's son Wolfgang on bass, to be honest, you wouldn't really notice the difference between his playing and Michael Anthony's because IMO Van Halen was always the weakest in this area. So to me not much is lost there other then the fact that it's not truly the original lineup. Overall I give this album a 4.5 out of 5 because two of the songs, Blood and Fire and The Trouble with Never, are a little on the weak side IMO.<br /><br />As far a people saying that there nothing new hear and it's just the same old Van Halen, what do you expect? This is who they are and this is what most of Van Halen fans want. We don't want something \\"new\\" from VH just something \\"better\\" and IMO we got it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great app. i use it all the time. I love the different views  and it is great when traveling.
B0045HCJSK|2.0|Rio Bravo had the potential to be a great western, but the studio moguls had other ideas...like making money at the box office.  What else could justify the casting of lightweights Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson?  I suppose with the breakup, Jerry Lewis wasn't available to play Colorado.  The song near the end of the film didn't help matters either.  How could John Wayne criticize High Noon and then make this kind of fluff?  This is not The Searchers (perhaps the definitive John Wayne film), but even as a light hearted western, it's about two hours too long.  The Duke has the sissy walk down and Angie Dickinson is not hard to look at, but Walter Brennan is the only gem in this clinker.
B0059ILFJ8|5.0|The music is without peer. It's beautiful smoky cabin country rock. This review is specifically for the vinyl. Rhino repressing of vinyl is excellent. The package uses the same type of paper as the original. The record logo is identical to the the 1970 edition and the sound is fantastic. I bought this with an excellent rhino pressing of workingman's dead  however American Beauty has some extra bass sound that I never heard on the old vinyl. The mid-range is rich and the high end is never shrill. Record collectors should not hesitate on this one. I sure wish Rhino would start pressing the Jerry Garcia/David Grisman albums. That's another story for another time.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Lots of features, and well implemented. Easy to use interface. I love that it can read and write comments on word documents. No regrets purchasing this one.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple little game that is sooooo pleasant to kill time with.  Love the soundtrack, very soothing.  What's not to love?
0142418471|4.0|I love John Green, and I adore David Levithan's writing. This was a very enjoyable book.  Somewhere near the end however, it started to become a little over-the-top and unrealistic.  Read this book if you want something you can thoroughly enjoy and get through quickly.
B0068TL23G|3.0|this app works well, the graphics are nice enough for a game that you would not ask awesome graphics for.<br />the gameplay is different and it just works, it looks pretty good on Kindle fire.
B0041OJ0Y8|5.0|When you first listen to some of the songs you're kind of like what the heck?!? but its very catch and addicting. I watched them on Youtube before ordering this as a gift the music is unique and you'll play it on repeat. It is considered Hip Hop however its totally its own category of music.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Lots of surprises in this final installment of the Hunger Games trilogy. The pacing moves much better than the second book. The revolution teased about in Catching Fire is now in full swing and the story keeps moving forward with a clear goal: assassinate President Snow. Every chapter ends with a new twist that keeps the pages turning.  At first, I did question some elements, like why does Katniss need to convince the rebels to guarantee immunity to Peeta (who was captured by the Capitol at the end of the second book)? What had he done that the rebels were supposed to consider traitorous? The rebels seemed to know better than Katniss how the Capitol was using Peeta, that he was a POW. But I just kind of let things like that go and got wrapped up in the story.  One thing I thought was brilliant was when the rebels' war council is trying to figure out how to best use Katniss. They realize that what the citizenry responded to the most in the two Games she was in was when she did the unexpected, like volunteering to go into the Games to save her sister, at risk to her own life. In other words, to capitalize on that, they need to put her into battle and let her be herself. Fortunately, these are also the things that make her an interesting character to us, so the author is basically giving Katniss license to take us on another adventure through this war.  Katniss has such low self-esteem that everyone else needs to keep reminding her the influence she has on the rebels, which she can't see herself. In fact, I expected this to be the big lesson she learns about herself at the end of the book, that maybe she will find her voice and become a leader. But this book is not about giving us what we expect, and the final chapters go in completely unpredictable directions. I was shocked at some of the decisions the author made about the fates of certain characters. It was thrilling for that very reason, even though some readers may not be entirely satisfied that things don't wrapup the way we'd hoped.
B006UG90RM|4.0|My first Van Halen purchase since 1984...was completely prepared to be sorely disappointed.  Heard Tattoo a few weeks ago and thought it was just okay.  Luckily, the rest of the cd is much better.  I have listened to it several times now and there is defintely a feel of the old VH here...more so than with anything they have put out since 1984.  It isn't perfect, but neither were Diver Down, Fair Warning, or WACF...there are clunkers on all of those albums, but we all learned to love even the clunkers.  So it will be with this album.  The best songs are Big River, Beats Workin, Outta Space, and She's The Woman.  Four very good songs on one album should be enough for anybody, considering the crap we have to listen to today.  I was also surprised at how heavy these songs are compared to the pop rock that they have been putting out for so long.  Thank god.
B001LF347E|5.0|Arrived a week before the estimated date, so that's a bonus. Came in a plastic wrapping, in perfect condition. And the \\"Merlin\\" series itself is addictive, once you get one, you will want them all!! Definitely worth it.
B0059XTUB8|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 3.5<br /><br />Colin Clark was only 24 years old when he served as '3rd Assistant Director' on the 1957 film 'The Prince and The Showgirl' starring Marilyn Monroe and Lawrence Olivier. Clark kept a diary while on the set and later published it, along with a memoir of his purported experiences with Monroe. It's notable that Clark didn't seem overly impressed with the Hollywood icon, when he wrote in his diary, but when the memoir came out, his view of her apparently had changed to much more 'favorable'.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with 'My Week with Marilyn', it provides a glimpse at Marilyn Monroe at the height of her popularity, a few months after she married famed playwright, Arthur Miller, in 1956. This was a chance for Marilyn to show her chops, pitted against stage legend Olivier, who in turn was given the reins to direct, 'The Prince and the Showgirl', a light weight comedy with the \\"most popular woman in the world\\", in the starring role. Dougray Scott is a dead ringer for Miller but his character is only on screen very briefly, as Miller decided to go back home right before the shoot, as he was having trouble putting up with all of Marilyn's mood changes. Judi Dench is also too briefly seen as Dame Sybil Thorndike, who plays an older aristocratic woman in the film within a film.<br /><br />Michelle Williams does a very nice job conveying the many moods of the starlet. When Monroe first came to the set of 'The Prince and the Showgirl', she was intimidated by Olivier, who was not impressed with her coach, Paula Strausberg, an advocate of Method Acting. While Kenneth Branagh doesn't look at all like Olivier, he ably conveys his contempt for both Marilyn's lack of professionalism and 'The Method' itself, as he was convinced that actors could never be spontaneous when utilizing such a technique. Olivier is seen warning Clark that he should not be fooled by Monroe's \\"little girl lost\\" routine. Not only was Monroe habitually late on the set but we learn of a more deep-seated insecurity, which she attempted to mask by imbibing huge amounts of prescription medication.<br /><br />Williams also does well in conveying Marilyn Monroe's charm. Most of the film's narrative is about how Colin Clark acts as her buffer, 'protecting' her against the various people she felt assailed by, including her business partner, Milton Greene, who attempted to bar Clark from spending time with her, during the production. Clark appears to fall completely for Monroe especially after she continuously flirts with him. In one scene, Monroe encourages Clark to join him skinny-dipping in a lake, off the beaten path, in the English countryside; later, she invites him into her bed for some heavy duty cuddling.<br /><br />While entertaining, the film suffers from the limits of its venue. We pretty much realize that the stakes aren't that high here to begin with--a young man takes a soft fall, after he realizes that his infatuation was just that--an infatuation! The 'dark moment' of the second Act arrives when Marilyn has her big meltdown, which threatens to shut down the entire production. All's well that ends when, when Marilyn wakes up and wants to go home for her mother-in-law's chicken soup, back in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Eddie Redmayne may be a tad too old to play Colin Clark, but is still fine as the impressionable gopher. Emma Watson is seen for a short time in a throwaway part as Colin's love interest, perhaps the least interesting role in the entire film. There are other players in short bits here, that add to the film's overall verisimilitude.<br /><br />Perhaps the most telling scene in the film is when Clark asks Marilyn to give up her career and run away with him. She graciously declines by replying that she enjoys her life. If that's the case, why does she spend so much time popping pills and generally being so down on herself? Olivier sees her as a lot shrewder than many of her handlers and sycophants, who appear to indulge and enable her. This is perhaps one aspect of Marilyn's character, the shrewd businesswoman, that is not explored very fully in this film--however, since we're only getting a glimpse of what she was like during a limited time period, such an exploration may be a bit beyond the scope of this overall project.<br /><br />'My Week with Marilyn' sometimes borders on hagiography. Whatever talent Marilyn Monroe did have, it seems that the many men who 'fell in love' with her, fell more for an image than a real person. I wonder if she could have done as well in the acting department, if she wasn't completely addicted to all her pills. Nonetheless, here, Michelle Williams does a fine job in serving up enough aspects of Marilyn Monroe's character to keep us interested until the end. Sadly Colin Clark is no longer with us, but while he was alive, he must have looked back on those heady days of his youth, as perhaps the greatest experience of his life. 'My Week With Marilyn' allows us to take that journey too, and a good part of it rings true.ect of Marilyn's character, the shrewd businesswoman, that is not explored very fully in this film--however, since we're only getting a glimpse of what she was like during a limited time period, such an exploration may be a bit beyond the scope of this overall project.

067144901X|5.0|I started reading this book to a friends child well before I had my own kiddo.  I received three copies for a book baby shower and have used all three!  A great book to get babies understanding basic sounds (Moo, Baa, La).  It is short enough to keep their attention.  The board book is quite durable and small enough to place in a diaper bag for travel.
0679722610|4.0|The Continental Op who is the narrator of the novel doesn't even give a name. If you know the author's history, he was probably basing it on his experiences with the Pinkerton Detective Agency in Butte, Montana. Anyway, the Op is sent to Personville which was pronounced Poisonville somewhere near Utah.<br /><br />The setting is curious to me. When you first start reading, you keep asking yourself why the Op stays in this corruptive village in the middle of nowhere. It's a mining town but it's filled with plenty of corruption. Everybody is corrupt even the narrator. The stories here were told in a serialized style for pulp fiction magazines for entertainment value.<br /><br />Is there literary value in pulp fiction, you bet there is with Dashiell Hammett who was the king of pulp fiction of his time period. He was a troubled author with alcohol problems, health, and his own demons of war and experiences as a Pinkerton detective. He was really trying to redefine the mystery detective genre.<br /><br />Unlike Sherlock Holmes, Jane Marple or Hercule Poirot, Op is unique in his voice. He's not necessarily evil nor good but shady and complicated. His character is never really defined nor do we do much about his character's history and background. He stays to clean up Personville.<br /><br />True to style, Hammett's writing includes plenty of references to alcohol during the prohibition time period which this book was written in the first place. It was published in 1926 at the height of prohibition where alcohol consumption and distribution was largely forbidden. Well, corruption ran rampant anyway.<br /><br />That's the morality tale here about corruption in a small town or any town over alcohol, power, money, etc. The characters here are thinly veiled and just mere caricatures of society's depiction of the time period. We don't feel sympathy towards anybody in this novel nor do we root for anybody even Op.<br /><br />I was assigned to read this novel for my 20th Century American history class in college about the 1920s. At times, I struggled with all the murders, crimes, motives, and explanations regarding the novel. I do now understand a lot more about the 1920s. Personville seemed more like Poisonville after all with blood, poison, manipulation, lies, treachery, even in the small towns.

086571701X|4.0|This is a very informative book. If you were only going to buy one book on this topic, this would be it. It gives you rules of thumb at the end of every chapter that condense and summarize the chapter. The flood and drain system she advocates removes the drudgery of having to clean the grow beds or replace media. The system takes care of itself biologically. Now all we have to do is start erecting greenhouses in all the abandoned factory and shopping center parking lots and start living local.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|Well the Saga continues.. Amazon is where I get the majority of all my movies and have yet to ever be dis-satisfied.. I will say I was very impressed with this one as well as all the prior Final Destinations. Although as gruesome as the others these movies are not the typical gore factor... Seems each \\"Final\\"  has left you feeling satisfied.. This one is no different. In fact I think its right up there at one of the best....  Some of the characters you wanna kill yourself. (like Macho Geek) Sometimes the acting was Poor but personally expected...  I find that each death is unique and for the most part totally catch you off guard. Sure you know its coming but you just dont ever know just how creative they're going to be with them.. Unlike the others the Ending to #5 is SO awesomely WOW Factor.  Talk about twisted fate.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This is the best album by the Foo Fighters since the first album in 1995 that is there best record for me.Dave finally proves that he is not trying to sound like Kurt Nirvana did not have to many poppy songs that were all singalongs.there is not one bad song on this album Rope Dear Rosemary These Days and Walk are the songs i listen to the most ,great melodies great production. Dear Rosemary is one of my favorites it has great harmonies with Bob Mould of Husker Du, the other songs Back And Forth and I Should Of Know Better with Krist from Nirvana on bass are the other highlights.great solos and vocals on most of the songs.the only thing Dave needs to stop is the screaming in every song his voice is a little to clean to be singing that way. this is one of the best albums released this year that i bought since there are not many rock albums that are that good these days.it is up for album of the year at the grammys this year i hope it wins a few. I give this album a 5 rating
B000GBEWHA|2.0|I love the movie, so my rating is not based on my opinion of the film.  My biggest problem is with this edition: the \\"Rockin' Rydell\\" edition. They have made all the songs sound all echo-ey. It's distracting and does not fit well with the film. It really bothers me. I'm probably going to sell the DVD somewhere and stick with my VHS.  If you don't want to watch this movie for the music, go ahead and buy it. But if you like the music, don't buy it.

1451648537|5.0|So many reviews - but I have to say that as a fairly recent Macbook convert after years of PC-ing, reading this long but easy to read book made me regret not having been an apple-a-holic from day one. A profile of a tormented genius, difficult to work with, but whose genius and incredible enthusiasm were admirable. Reading the book after his passing made me wonder what will become of the future of technology without him. Yes, he leaves a legacy of great collaborators, but every idea emanated from Jobs. May he rest in peace - and thank you, Steve, for sharing your brilliance.

This might make a difference to people who are trying whether to buy the dead tree version or the Amazon proprietary version.  As for the book...  Very nice read with many memorable quotes, scenes and episodes from Steve Jobs's life and era.  There are a number of nice features which capitalize on the digital nature of the book such as summaries, quotes, searchability, nice photos, chapter source notes and more.

With this book in your pack you could jump out of a plane anywhere on earth and have a shot at survival.  Even Thoreau would be impressed.
B0067H9W72|5.0|I must say despite this season being more slow than last season. I find it works for the series and the overall story. Yes no doubt this show is called the Walking Dead and it has zombies in it however the show is about people interacting in a broken rule. If you don't think this is true and if you think that all zombie films or tv shows should be just mindless entertainment then you need to think again. The Walking Dead is taking on the kinda of story telling that George Romero does. Themes of greed, racism, distrust, and the line between surviving and living were evident in Romero's films as they are in this show. Despite what people might say about this show, it can't just be about zombies. This is not a two hour movie were character development is done in a hour. In order to be a good tv show, no matter the genre, no matter the subject. You have to keep people invested in the characters.  One of the reasons Dexter is so popular is because of this. The Walking Dead first and foremost is a drama. I know that is how AMC presented it to the guys behind the comic and they obviously agreed. Yes the show has to keep the suspense, action, and horror of people living in a world filled with zombies but what is refreshing is to see a show go back to the roots of a genre that has been over killed and reduced to mindless entertainment like the Resident Evil movies which after the second film went downhill. I think the acting is top notch especially from Norman Reedus who plays Daryl.
B004A8ZWVK|1.0|The characters are nothing but caricatures, and there is nothing interesting, refreshing or artistic about a movie that perpetuates misconceptions.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading this after hearing how great it was from numerous friends... I really wasn't all that interested... it didn't sound that great. I finished reading the book in just two nights... I could hardly put it down! Great book!

B005LAJ23A|1.0|I happily bought the first season on blu-ray, but i will not spend a dime on the second season, purely an emo soap opera. What a let down. One can hope AMC will get back to Frank Darabont vision....The Walking Dead's second season premiered last fall to huge ratings and a fan response even bigger than the series premiere back in 2010. But according to former showrunner Frank Darabont, those same AMC budget cuts that helped drive him from the series also prevented his awesome idea to start season two with a prequel episode that would have put us inside a zombie war zone.  In The Walking Dead's first season we got a good look at the ruined city of Atlanta and the zombies that still occupied it as Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) went searching for his family and found another gang of survivors instead. One of the more memorable sequences from the storyline found Rick trapped in a tank with a zombie soldier, who you might have recognized as Being Human's Sam Witwer.  It looks like an amusing little cameo from an actor Darabont worked with on The Mist, but in a video interview posted Jan. 3, Witwer revealed that his brief appearance was actually the setup for a potential prequel story.  \\"If you look closely, I played that zombie, because we were setting up this prequel we were going to do. If you watch the pilot of The Walking Dead, that's me in the tank as the zombie, and then Rick blasts him and he gets deafened, and he gets that grenade which saves him at the end of the season,\\" Witwer said.  The prequel revolving around Witwer's zombie soldier was, predictably, nixed because of budget cuts. He may have a sweet gig on Being Human these days, but Witwer's still not happy that AMC let Darabont and all his awesome ideas go.  \\"It's not happening now. Why? Because AMC wanted to save a few bucks. That is just one example of the kind of cool, awesome forethought [Darabont] has put into this show that is now absolutely written off,\\" Witwer said. \\"For me it doesn't matter much, because I'm busy doing Being Human. We were going to schedule things around. I'm not lamenting the loss of a job, I'm lamenting the loss of an amazing idea. And there are dozens and dozens of amazing ideas just like that which are now gone.\\"  CraveOnline initially reported that the concept was going to be used for a web series, but when Darabont responded to the story in a letter to Ain't It Cool News, he said it was actually the plan for the whole season-two premiere.  \\"The idea was to do this with a very focused 'you are there' documentary feel. Not going all shaky-cam, but still making it a bit rawer and grainier than the rest of the show,\\" Darabont said. \\"We'd start with a squad of maybe seven or eight soldiers being dropped into the city by chopper. They have map coordinates they need to get to; they've been told to report to a certain place to provide reinforcement. It's not a special mission, it's basically a housekeeping measure putting more boots on the ground to reinforce key intersections and installations throughout the city. And we follow this group from the moment the copter sets them down.\\"  Basically the idea was to do a kind of Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down with zombies. What starts as a simple mission would have all gone to hell, but over the course of the episode we would have also had a chance to run into a few familiar faces.  \\"Picture our squad arriving at a manned barricade where some civilians are being held back from leaving the city on shoot-to-kill orders to stop the spread of contagion, it's a panicked high-intensity scene, and in this crowd of desperate people we find Andrea and Amy,\\" Darabont said. \\"The barricade gunners panic, the civilians start to get mowed down by machine gun fire, and in this melee the girls get pulled to safety by some old guy they don't even know. It's Dale. He's nobody to them, just some guy who saw the opportunity to do the right thing and reacted in the moment. This would have been perhaps a minute ortwo of the episode, just a cool detour like the various outposts the soldiers encounter in Saving Private Ryan, but we would have witnessed the moment that Dale meets Andrea and Amy, seen where that relationship began.\\"  The episode would have ended with Witwer's character as the last man standing, reaching the coordinates the squad was supposed to hit even though he'd already been bitten by the undead. He crawls into the tank, prepared to commit suicide by grenade, then dies instead. Darabont then wanted to time-lapse into a shot-for-shot reprise of Rick entering the tank and encountering Witwer's zombie.  \\"The notion was to take the 'throwaway' tank zombie Rick encountered in the pilot, and tell that soldier's story,\\" Darabont said. \\"Make him the star of his own movie, follow his journey, but don't reveal who he is until the end. The idea being that every zombie has a story, every undead extra was once a human being with a life of his/her own ... was, in a sense, the star of his own life's movie. And we've followed this one particular guy and seen how his life ended; we witness his struggles, see his good intentions and his failures, and we experience his godawful death in this tank. That's why I cast Sam as that tank zombie in the first place instead of just casting some extra. I had this story in mind while filming the pilot, and I knew I'd need a superb actor to play that soldier when the time came.\\"  Darabont also noted that the idea of a \\"wild card\\" episode focusing on a character we're not used to meeting was one he would have liked to continue as the series progressed. But of course, none of that will happen now. Darabont is gone and the show goes on, but at least we can think about what might have been.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|I was quite skeptical about this movie.  It seemed like it was going to be quite cheesy, with boxing robots and all.  After finally renting the film to watch with my five year old son, I was pleasantly surprised to find it very palatable.  The story does well to go far deeper than just fighting robots.  Personally, I found it to be much better than the transformers crap that has been released over the last three years.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|Van Halen has always been a band that has found a way to break traditional rules about popularity and longevity and forge their own path in the music business. In many ways this record continues that tradition. I have to be honest here and say, the first time I heard this record, I was not exactly elated. When you read about a new Van Halen project with David Lee Roth, I think a natural expectation is to hear a record loaded with radio hits. But in truth that is a lofty and unfair rationale given their last group effort with Dave took place in the 80's (a full record, not just individual tunes here and there).<br /><br />So is ADKOT a followup to 1984? Not even close. Is it more related to Diver Down or Women and Children First? Not exactly. Does it sit closer to Fair Warning? A few tunes find more common ground there. But overall I really have to say ADKOT is it's own animal. From what I have read, the majority of these are rewritten songs originally conceived and demoed back in the 70's and early 80's. So the album certainly weaves itself in and out of those records as you listen to the various treatments. But there is definitely a stamp of today in those songs.<br /><br />It's hard to know what the wisdom is in going back and reworking songs from a different era that never made it on a record. Does the era really dictate much in the final product since they are being reworked towards the sensibilities of the artist today? You're definitely waxing nostalgia for a specific demographic when that becomes part of the selling point. But for me, this album honestly comes across more as Van Halen today. And the references to yesterday are really not relevant to that final product.<br /><br />What IS surprising is how much the record grew on me. And that in itself is a different listening experience with Van Halen. Instead of hearing instant favorites, I slowly warmed to many of the songs to the point where I really like them today. &#34;Shes the Woman&#34; and 'Stay Frosty&#34; are easily among my personal favorites. &#34;Tattoo&#34; while an odd choice as a lead single, does retain enough appeal to hold it's own from the Van Halen hit factory. The album as a whole is a considerable jam session that makes me appreciate the talent that is Eddie Van Halen. The listening experience has also taught me that sometimes its better to let these artists come to you on their own terms rather than blindly hand over the same old predictable product.<br /><br />Eddie Van Halen continues to push the boundaries and create music the way he hears it. And while this record did not immediately warm to me like previous efforts, it definitely made me appreciate Eddie as an artist and remind me he is forever trying to find new and inventive ways to bring new material to the masses. Sometimes the music purposely veers from becoming predictably commercial, but it's always inventive and unrelenting in finding a new direction. That's a refreshing quality that seems to forever define this artist and his band. I have tremendous respect for that.ty&#34; are easily among my personal favorites. &#34;Tattoo&#34; while an odd choice as a lead single, does retain enough appeal to hold it's own from the Van Halen hit factory.

B005LAIGGY|2.0|Before I dig into the review, let me give a bit of a spiel regarding my opinion of 9/11-based movies.  I personally see no fault or problem in films being made about the event, as long as it doesn't in any way come off as exploitative (I'm pointing at YOU, World Trade Center).  Many I know say they usually pass on 9/11 films due to having already lived through it, but have you?  With that in mind, on with the review.<br /><br />This past Tuesday, the Academy announced their nominations for this year's Oscars.  Among them was Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, which was greeted with applause as it was revealed it nabbed a Best Picture nomination.  So today, I've decided to see the film for myself, and I have to honestly say I was left feeling disappointed.<br /><br />Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks), a loving husband and father, was killed on 9/11 during a meeting at the World Trade Center.  He leaves behind his distraught wife Linda (Bullock) and his always-curious son Oskar (Horn), born with a natural sense for adventure and seeing things through.  Weeks after \\"the worst day\\" as he calls it, Oskar is shuffling through his deceased father's closet when he knocks over a vase containing a key, which is in a small envelope with \\"Black\\" written on it.<br /><br />To make all sorts of explaining really short, he sets off on an expedition in New York City.  His plan is to find every person with the last name \\"Black\\" in all the five boroughs, hoping to get information about the mystery key.  Along the way he meets many people facing problems of their own, including a sheltered and mute-by-choice old man (Max Von Sydow, in the best performance of this movie) who only goes by the alias `The Renter.'<br /><br />Along the way, Oskar slowly pries his way into the Renter's mysterious life and equally strains his relationship with his mother, all in the hope of getting another chance at a few more minutes of spiritual face-time with his father.<br /><br />I'm not gonna lie, I loved the story.  However, screenwriters Eric Roth and Jonathan Foer pulled a few cinematic punches I didn't really like.  Parts of the way the story was told seem to deceive us, almost to the point of leaving an inconsistent pace.  This left me as an audience member feeling disjointed and asking myself if parts of the film were indeed the exploitation I was speaking of earlier.<br /><br />I was left feeling like if this film's background was based on anything BESIDES 9/11, this film would be absolutely forgettable and the Academy would pay no heed.  I'm not saying I feel like the film ONLY got Oscar attention because of that legitimate \\"worst day,\\" I'm just saying that let's say Tom Hanks was killed in a car wreck or something, then the eventual moral of this film would be completely ruined before the quarter-mark.  The way 9/11 was used as a deliberate dramatic device instead of a legitimate piece of the plot is extortion.than Foer pulled a few cinematic punches I didn't really like.

B004O3YGMC|1.0|So I can't say this with 100% accuracy.  But it seems a little strange that I logged into one of my accounts via splashtop and then it was hacked.  Everything else my husband and I did was the same but his account was fine.
0307593312|4.0|Though the story revolves around the idea of two different realities and redemption, it really is, at its core, a beautiful love story. If you're one who loves a good solid love story without any sappy and unrealistic sugar coating, then this is the book for you. It is romance at it's very thrilling edge. And whilst other writers may struggle to flesh up a poignant and romantic yet realistic love story, Murakami does it immensely well. And thus, maybe that's what sets him apart from others.  Praise aside, I was slightly disappointed by the ending and lack of conclusion that the story possessed. At the end of the book, it seemed as though there were too many loose strands and untapped mysteries that were left hanging, but most of Murakami's novels are like that. It's still a masterpiece.
0545265355|4.0|I loved The Hunger Games and I'm excited to see the movie. Catching Fire was okay although I think there was room for more character development. I did not like MockingJay. I don't know if it was because it was so real so true and not happy enough for me or if it was that I just didn't value the storyline as highly.  The product was reasonably priced and the quality good.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was one of my all time favorites. I could not put it down and would become annoyed if anything interrupted me! The characters of Belle and Lavinia were well thought out and the story being told through them both provided an interesting perspective. I felt an eerie sense early on that Marshall was going to become the destructive force that he turned out to be. I know it's a sign of an amazing novel when I feel a sense of loss at the end for the characters I had grown to love.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|Review no. 266. Thirteen track miraculous come back the the almighty Van Halen. Personally, I like this lp better than I did '1984'. About every cut here truly showcases the true roots of the 'original' Van Halen in full spirit, heart, energy and vibe. Songs like the disc's first single \\"Tattoo\\", the typical modern-day classic VH gem \\"She's The Woman\\", \\"Blood And Fire\\", the total ass-kicking \\"As Is\\", \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll\\" and \\"The Trouble With Never\\" get the blood-a pumping. Also loved the power-house rocker \\"Outta Space\\", acoustic upbeat \\"Big River\\" (reminds of \\"Ice Cream Man\\") and \\"Beats Workin'\\" that makes me feel like I want to rampage through the streets at 2 am and spill beer over people's head. No 28-30 minute way-too brief lp here - but a full fifty-minute dose of old school Van Halen mayhem as so many of us true us old school fans have come to expect. Cannot wait to catch Eddie Van Halen and the guys out on tour again. Van Halen was my second-ever concert I attended some thirty-three light years ago. Highly recommend.
B004GJYROG|5.0|This movie started me thinking about Michael's talent and skill in basketball.  Very impressed with true life story of Michael.  Love the mixture of real life and cartoon in the movie.  Lots of laughs and the actors were great in it.
0345528581|4.0|I really liked this book. In fact I read it and re-read it several times before I tried the basic program, mostly for motivational purposes. Being a veteran, body weight training will always have a place in my physical training program since I've experienced first hand the benefits it offers. It is important to note that the programs in this book will not turn you into a fitness model with big pretty muscles. It will lean you out and make you muscular, giving you a functional look as well as functional strength for everyday life. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking either to get back into shape after a long lay off, or those that are looking for something different to try other than the same old bodybuilding routines.
B00656C6KK|5.0|This lovely compilation of songs is at once heartfelt, heart-rendered, and heart-affecting. Ms. Day gracefully bowed from the spotlight years ago, and has devoted much of her later life to animal welfare. What she left behind, besides a glorious body of work in music, film and television, was the magic and mystique, alluring and nurturing at the same time, that was and will always be \\"Doris Day\\". Listening to these songs gives one the feeling of catching up with a dear old friend. \\"My Heart\\" is not only a loving tribute to her late son, Terry Melcher, but a deeply felt love letter to all her admirers. These songs will warm your soul. Thank you very much, Doris!
B0071T5PN0|5.0|I'll keep it short. The music is brilliant. Dave does a great job. Eddie....Best guitar work since the first few albums. I think he even got faster. Alex kicks tail. The kid Wolfie...UN_\\"FREAKIN\\"_BELIEVABLE. I have been playing bass for 26 years and I'm impressed. I bet he has been a big influence on the band. Just what this band needed....The return of Dave and a kick in the tail from a kid.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I am very happy with this folio cover.  I carry my kindle fire in my purse and am not very gentle with it and this cover does the trick.  Plus I love the fact that I can stand it up and read, watch movies or play games...even at work!

B006TLFPKO|5.0|I have seen all of these movies and I would have to say Breaking Dawn 1 is just as great if not better than the rest of them.  I have been very impressed from the start.I truely love these movies. I really hope that these movies continue.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|It isn't cheap, but its worth the price. I specifically got a kindle fire so I could write when the inspiration hit rather than waiting for my laptop to power up. The app works great: no problems transferrng files between my kindle and my laptop. Typing is tricky but that's the kindle's problem. This app has made a huge difference in my productivity. I haven't used the Excel or Powerpoint tu.actions, but I can say that the text editor just like Word. Also, it can save rtf files. I'm not sure if that was mentioned in the description.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever. I'm so glad I have on Blue-Ray, hope it will stick around for more years to come. Also, \\"Batman Begins\\" is a must-have movie.
B006UG90RM|5.0|When the single \\"tattoo\\" was released back in January it took little time for haters to bash VH. Many were angry that the song sounded too much like a previous demo from the 70's. Others were upset that Wolfgang replaced Micheal Anthony. However, when you play this album, for the next 50 minutes you'll be transported back to what Van Halen should be. Hellfire guitar solos, drums that beat your ears in, a bass that thumps the loins, and vocals added where available. For anybody wanting Sam Hager piano love ballads, stray away. For those who want REAL rock 'n' roll, strap in. It's a helluva ride.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was such a great book. I wished it never stopped. I can`t wait until I start the next one. I hope it is as good as the first one. The first part was a little slow though. But, how Susan described the games made it one of the best books I have ever read.
B000ZNQEMU|5.0|Ive had this on my motorcycle key chain for about 6 months and it is still in tact. I love this thing, seeing the little guy fly throughout the air when i ride is pretty cool, I actually noticed someone else had the Anakin on their bike key when i came to a stop light so i guess other people like the idea also. I also have gotten many compliments on it as he hangs from my belt line. I'm ordering the shadow trooper to go with this little guy, I'm sure they'll compliment each other very well.
1572814349|5.0|I received The Golden Tarot this morning, the artwork is amazing, the cards are typical size for a Tarot deck, not too big, not too small. The golden edging made the cards stick together at first, but once I went through the deck and shuffled them a couple times the issue was resolved. I read some reviews that said they are hard to shuffle...my experience is completely different, these are easy to shuffle. I can only imagine the issues others have had are actually because it's a 72 card deck, not 52 like playing cards. I am 100% satisfied with this product.
0061537969|5.0|This book grabbed me from the beginning. I love the characters, I WANT to know what happens to them!  I even got my mom to read it, and my hubby to listen to it (that's a step in the right direction, he hates reading).  I can't say enough good things about this book. :)
B004XVN1T4|5.0|This is my favorite suspense thriller of all time. I read it in the 80s and I remember pacing my room while reading it, well after 1am. \\"Gawd, stone the crows!\\"
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I devoured The Hunger Games and  Catching Fire. They were beautiful and devestating and I was swept away by the intense story and wonderful characters. However Mockingjay was so awful I cant help but wonder if Ms. Collins threw the 2nd half of the book away. She made unneccessary decisions about the fate of the central characters and it had a rushed, unfinished feel. I cant for the life of my how her editor could have been satisfied. The manuscript should have been sent back and re-worked. Shame on Ms. Collins for ruining an otherwise captivating trilogy. With the books made into film I hope they change the ending.
1439102813|1.0|I got about 20 pages into this and gave up.  The characters seem obsessed with their Harvard lineage: anywhere the word \\"school\\" or \\"work\\" would have sufficed, the word \\"Harvard\\" was used. Then the main character \\"Alice\\" started blaming her husband for not being home enough despite the fact that she spends as much time traveling as he does.  I took both of those observations as early indicators that I would be wasting my time to continue, so it was back to The Hangman's Daughter\\".
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app! It is solo Much fun!! It is a great time waster and has more levels than the iphone.
B000002LEM|5.0|OU812 is by far the best Van Hagar album. I feel that the band's youth is still present. The party rock songs are still there, such as Cabo Wabo. I love the power ballad, When Its Love. Van Halen have proved with this release that Sammy Hagar is the man for Van Halen. A must have!
B004Q7E0TA|5.0|Celebrity memoirs tend to be frustrating at best.... think: nicole richie. tori spelling. \\"kardashian konfidential\\". vomit. this book isn't like that to me. you don't have to be a lesbian or have experienced an eating disorder to feel genuine emotion for her story. i love the clarity and honesty that serves as the base for each and every chapter. she's not writing this book to impress anyone, to gain pity, or to become more popular. portia's memoir comes across as very heartfelt, real, and terrifying. i give her a lot of credit for getting her life to the point it is today. for those that criticize for her continued eating disorder and self esteem pitfalls.... i dare you to show me one person that's been through what she has that doesn't have those days. I wasn't a portia de rossi fan to begin with, but this book makes me respect her. a lot.
B000002LPD|5.0|This is an excellent follow up to 1988's OU812. This is by far the strongest Van Hagar album, as the keyboards have become outdated, and replaced with the guitar once more, after the synthesizer age of the Eighties died down. Every track on this album is superb, and are all hardcore rockers.<br /><br />Personal favorites include, Runaround, Pleasure Dome, and Right Now. A must have for the Van Hagar fan
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|This movie was probably one of the better of the year.  It did not get the attention it deserved and the three leading comedians are all extremely gifted actors as well and came through with very strong performances.  The scenery was gorgeous and you'll want to go to Attoo.  Funny with a touch of heart ache and that little hint that it's a story that gets at what its all about.
B000002MUQ|2.0|The main issue with Balance is tone. The production is terrible, and the chemistry of Hagar VH is not present. There are two great songs, and the rest are trash. Van Halen III is far better than this trash. Fair Warning: Buy Van Halen III, and avoid this garbage!
B001F9Y2CM|4.0|The ABBA \\"The Albums\\" boxset lived up to my expectations - almost. I the CD's are perfect; excellent quality of sound. The case looks great! I really like the shiny logo on it. My only complaint is that the CD's are held in sleeves instead of larger plastic cases. Other than that, I have no complaints. The booklet that comes with the boxset has a nice intro. The timeline also has some interesting photos of the group. If you're looking for a compact boxset, this products is for you. Overall: I give it a 4/5 stars. I highly recomend it for any ABBA fan. This is a high quality product that I personally think is worth the price.
B00004Y6OA|3.0|This actually isn't too bad. I played it once and was disappointed. But after a few listens it grew on me. And The Cradle Will Rock is the best song. The rest are good, but should have been reworked before release.<br /><br />There is also too much filler. Tora Tora, and Loss of Control do not pass as songs to me. But overall it's OK for Van Halen.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|The cover is everything that I'd hoped it would be! It makes my Kindle feel like a book in my hand and when it's not in use, my Kindle looks like a beautiful leather-bound book.<br /><br />The Kindle fits securely, the keyboard, charging dock and buttons are all easily accessible. The only thing that kept this from being a 5-star review is that it does have a distinct, though not unpleasant, odor about it. Hopefully that will fade with time and if so, I'll come back and update the review and add the final star. :)<br /><br />UPDATE 2/29/12: The odd smell is now GONE so I have upgraded this from four stars to five.

B005LAIGPA|3.0|I'm pretty sure that I've seen most if not all of the genre now called \\"found footage\\" films, going back the grandmother of them all \\"The Blair Witch Project.\\"  I've liked some and not others pretty much like any other film.  One common thread is a theme of dread, relatively unknown actors and filmmakers, and low budget.  Fine, no problem.  Director Josh Trank throws a few wrinkles into the camera footage by not limiting the filming to just one camera.  This iteration incorporates a friend's use of a camera (school reporter doncha know), hospital security cameras, helicopter cameras, etc. and then shows it edited together to get the movie.<br /><br />Our 3 teenage \\"heroes\\" being a little tipsy coming from a party find a big hole in the ground and decide to slip into it and see what's what.  Some alien remnants (I guess) are discovered that put out some intergalactic emission that gives the 3 boys supernatural powers.  As they discover their powers, they begin to innocently play tricks on each other and eventually other people.  As their use increases, so does their strength.  As one points out, the gift is like a muscle.  The more you use it the stronger it becomes.  Eventually they do attain strength and even the ability to fly.  In other words, Superman/boy without the costume.<br /><br />One of the boys, Andrew (Dane DeHaan) has always been an outcast and socially shy.  His mother is gravely ill with some undisclosed respiratory problem and his father is an out of work fireman who hits the bottle and his son.  His cousin Matt (Alex Russell) is one of those cool kids but not in the athletic hierarchy.  Finally there is Steve (Michael B. Jordan) who is at the peak of high school cool.  An athlete, class president and on his way to a political career.  Eventually, Andrew realizes by using his powers he too can become cool, but alas he stumbles when he tries to bed one of his classmates.  He's never the same.  He becomes violent and tragedy ensues.<br /><br />Cousin Matt becomes the eventual voice of reason and tries to reel in Andrew.  The film certainly has its moments.  The interaction between the guys seems legit.  Yet there is something not quite right about Andrew complete personality change.  It's like Bruce Banner changing into The Hulk.  The other two are not affected this way.  Even at a crisp 84 minute running time, the final flying/destruction sequence seems to go on forever.

0142419400|5.0|So a moment of truth. I would never, ever, ever have picked this book up and given it a shot if I hadn't first heard all the references to it by EVERY BLOGGER ON THE NET. No, my caps lock is not broken. I feel confident in saying that this book is universally loved and adored by everyone who reads it. Seriously. I have yet to see one bad review. I first became aware of Anna and the French Kiss while stalking the YA book blogs last summer. At that time, I was firmly planted in the YA paranormal reads camp. I was beginning to branch out more and was reading some dystopic/post apocalyptic, but I absolutely did not do contemporary YA lit. I am embarrassed to admit that in my mind I felt contemporary YA was too much on the young side, not enough on the adult side. Even though I had loved them at the time, I hadn't read contemporary teenage books since I was a teenager.  Had I seen this book sitting on a shelf in a book store I would have passed it right on by. I mean look at that title for goodness sake. It SCREAMS teenager! I thought, as a thirty something, that I wouldn't be able to relate. Well, I was wrong. On all fronts. Today, a majority of what I read is contemporary YA. And the book bloggers whose reviews I was reading were all recommending Stephanie Perkins' Anna and the French Kiss. I am so thankful that I followed their advice.<br /><br />What makes this book so utterly fabulous? Let me count the ways. Characters, characters, characters. Authentic, familiar dialogue. Romance that will set your heart a flutter. And an enchanting setting that becomes a character unto itself.<br /><br />Let's begin with our protagonist Anna. Has there ever been a more genuinely likeable character than Anna Oliphant?  She's got so much going on. Here she is, the ultimate fish out of water, a southern girl spending her senior year in Paris. She doesn't speak the language. She's never been this far away from home or her family. She's missing her best friend and she's bummed that she was just starting to connect with her long time crush /coworker when her nouveau rich dad decides to ship her off and add some culture to her life.<br /><br />\\"At least the people in my new school speak English. It was founded for pretentious Americans who don't like the company of their own children. I mean, really. Who sends their kids to boarding school? It's so Hogwarts. Only mine doesn't have cute boy wizards or magic candy or flying lessons.\\"<br /><br />But other then a few bouts of crying in the beginning, Anna bounces back. She's tough, she can handle it. And I love that. We know Anna feels scared, anxious, and sad through the awesome inner monologue Perkins writes for her. Sometimes it pours out in a jumbled neurotic rant, which is fun to read and I think pretty darn true to life. Hasn't everybody gone off in their own head a few times (or perhaps on a fairly regular basis if you are like me) when life throws a bunch curve balls your way? It's these things that make Anna so real and authentic. It's easy to root for her and get behind her as she struggles to find her place in her new surroundings. Another thing that appeals to me about Anna is her moral compass. She is very sensitive and very considerate of her friend's feelings. When faced with a choice, she looks at all the angles and (for the most part) makes the right decision for herself. And you know, it's really nice to see a female MC who is not falling all over herself and looking like a fool for the attention of the boy she likes. Other than their first meeting, she is almost always composed around Etienne St.Clair. It seems like every heroine in YA these days does so much tripping and stuttering around cute boys, it's an embarrassment to my gender girls! C'mon, stand tall and hold your own like Anna does. If she can remain composed around someone like St. Clair, ANYONE can.<br /><br />Which brings us to the man himself. Oh, St. Clair. Stephanie Perkins really outdid herself when she crafted St. Clair. He's not perfect. He's short. He bites his nails to the nub. He's scared of heights AND scared of change.  He's got some issues. But in his own imperfect way, he is absolutely perfect. He's kind, he's funny, he's got great hair, and let's not forget that accent.<br /><br />\\"Eh-t-yen says my name like this: Ah-na.<br />My heart thump thump thumps in my chest.\\"<br /><br />The romance builds ever so slowly as St. Clair (with the long term girlfriend) and Anna (with the giant, unrequited crush back in Atlanta) become not just friends, but the best of friends. Like When Harry Met Sally friends. That's not to say that their aren't some moments between them that will make you tingle from your head to your toes, because there ARE.<br /><br />\\"It's odd, but I keep finding myself distracted. By the white of his teeth through the darkness. By a wavy bit of his hair that sticks straight out to the side. By the soft aroma of his laundry detergent. He nudges me to silently offer the armrest, but I decline and he takes it. His arm is close to mine, slightly elevated. I glance at his hands. Mine are tiny compared to his large, knuckly boy hands.<br />  And suddenly I want to touch him.<br />  Not a push, or a shove, or even a friendly hug. I want to feel the creases in his skin, connect his freckles with invisible lines, brush my fingers across the inside of his wrist. He shifts. I have the strangest feeling that he's as aware of me as I am of him. I can't concentrate. The characters on the screen are squabbling, but for the life of me, I don't know what about. How long have I not been paying attention?<br />  St. Clair coughs and shifts again. His leg brushes against mine. It stays there. I'm paralyzed. I should move it; it feels too unnatural. How can he not notice his leg is touching my leg? From the corner of my eye, I see the profile of his chin and nose, and -oh, dear God,- the curve of his lips.<br />  There. He glanced at me. I know he did.<br />  I bore my eyes into the screen, tyring my best to prove that I am Really Interested in this movie. St. Clair stiffens but doesn't move his leg. Is he holding his breath? I think he is. I'm holding mine. I exhale and cringe- it's so loud and unnatural.<br />  Again. Another glance. This time I turn, automatically, just as he's turning away. It's a dance, and now there's a feeling in the air like one of us should say something. Focus, Anna. Focus. \\"Do you like it?\\" I whisper.<br />  He pauses. \\"The film?\\"<br />  I'm thankful the shadows hide my blush.<br />  \\"I like it very much,\\" he says.<br />  I risk a glance, and St. Clair stares back. Deeply. He has not looked at me like this before. I turn away first, then feel him turn a few beats later.<br />  I know he's smiling, and my heart races.\\"<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />As we are left to wonder \\"will they, or won't they?\\" we learn more about Anna and St. Clair as well as their tight group of friends, described by Anna as having \\"an abundance of stylish black clothing and deliberately mussed hair\\" revealing they belong to the resident art clique. Each add so much to this story. I feel we get real insight into them, they aren't just extra bodies taking up space between the Anna/St.Clair story. I love Mer for taking Anna under her wing and assimilating her into her group, and I empathize with her in her own unrequited crush. I love the back and forth between Josh and Rashmi. And I love discovering more about them as Anna does. And Bridgette. I love her and wanted to strangle her at the same time. I don't think her friendship with Anna should be overlooked, because it really makes Anna take a step back and look at her own actions. Perkins does an amazing job with all of her characters, and I would love to see a spin off series with each of them (I think we do get more Josh in her third and final book of the series, Isla and the Happily Ever After, due to be released in 2013.) Lots of love in that paragraph, friends.  Literally. I said love four times. But it's true. I've fallen in love (five) with this book and this writer and and I must shout it from the Paris rooftops:)<br /><br />Which leads me to the final character featured in Anna, the city of Paris itself. So I'm lucky enough to have traveled there with my dad when I was in college. And it was all sorts of wonderful. But, I have often times wished I could go again, this time with my husband, and explore the city more with someone I loved. Not that I don't love my dad, but I mean looovve, like Anna/ St. Clair love. Because it IS the most romantic city in the world. Even traipsing around as a tourist with my old man,  I could see that. If I ever go back I'd skip all the tourist sites and most of the museums (I am an art major, cut me some slack) and I'd eat more and drink more better. I'd go in the spring (I went during Christmas back in college) and discover all the gardens and fountains. I'd go back to Notre Dame and look for the Point Zero stone in the street and make a wish as Anna and St. Clair did. Perkins could write for Frommer's or Lonely Planet travel guides (though it would be a waste of talent) because she's put so many wonderful details and visual imagery into her descriptions of this city. We can hear the opera singer across from Anna's dorm singing. We can taste the brioche with pears and pastel colored macarons. We can feel the cobblestone street under our feet as we run through the night. As she has stated in interviews, Perkins has written a love letter to Paris with this book and I applaud her.<br /><br />So once again, thank you fellow reviewers and bloggers. Without your pearls of wisdom I would never have taken a chance on this absolutely lovely piece of contemporary YA fiction and would have been really missing out. You girls have given me some great advice on books and authors I might not have discovered on my own (like Stephanie Perkins and Maureen Johnson and Simone Elkeles and Melina Marchetta and John Green and....and....) and I am eternally grateful. And thank you Stephanie Perkins for creating these amazing characters and this heartfelt story. You have set the bar high and I am looking forward to reading your stories for many years to come.esn't move his leg. Is he holding his breath? I think he is. I'm holding mine.

He has not looked at me like this before. I turn away first, then feel him turn a few beats later.    I know he's smiling, and my heart races.\\"  Sigh.  As we are left to wonder \\"will they, or won't they?\\" we learn more about Anna and St. Clair as well as their tight group of friends, described by Anna as having \\"an abundance of stylish black clothing and deliberately mussed hair\\" revealing they belong to the resident art clique. Each add so much to this story. I feel we get real insight into them, they aren't just extra bodies taking up space between the Anna/St.Clair story. I love Mer for taking Anna under her wing and assimilating her into her group, and I empathize with her in her own unrequited crush. I love the back and forth between Josh and Rashmi. And I love discovering more about them as Anna does. And Bridgette. I love her and wanted to strangle her at the same time. I don't think her friendship with Anna should be overlooked, because it really makes Anna take a step back and look at her own actions. Perkins does an amazing job with all of her characters, and I would love to see a spin off series with each of them (I think we do get more Josh in her third and final book of the series, Isla and the Happily Ever After, due to be released in 2013.) Lots of love in that paragraph, friends.  Literally. I said love four times. But it's true. I've fallen in love (five) with this book and this writer and and I must shout it from the Paris rooftops:)  Which leads me to the final character featured in Anna, the city of Paris itself. So I'm lucky enough to have traveled there with my dad when I was in college. And it was all sorts of wonderful. But, I have often times wished I could go again, this time with my husband, and explore the city more with someone I loved. Not that I don't love my dad, but I mean looovve, like Anna/ St. Clair love. Because it IS the most romantic city in the world. Even traipsing around as a tourist with my old man,  I could see that. If I ever go back I'd skip all the tourist sites and most of the museums (I am an art major, cut me some slack) and I'd eat more and drink more better. I'd go in the spring (I went during Christmas back in college) and discover all the gardens and fountains. I'd go back to Notre Dame and look for the Point Zero stone in the street and make a wish as Anna and St. Clair did. Perkins could write for Frommer's or Lonely Planet travel guides (though it would be a waste of talent) because she's put so many wonderful details and visual imagery into her descriptions of this city. We can hear the opera singer across from Anna's dorm singing. We can taste the brioche with pears and pastel colored macarons. We can feel the cobblestone street under our feet as we run through the night. As she has stated in interviews, Perkins has written a love letter to Paris with this book and I applaud her.  So once again, thank you fellow reviewers and bloggers. Without your pearls of wisdom I would never have taken a chance on this absolutely lovely piece of contemporary YA fiction and would have been really missing out. You girls have given me some great advice on books and authors I might not have discovered on my own (like Stephanie Perkins and Maureen Johnson and Simone Elkeles and Melina Marchetta and John Green and....and....) and I am eternally grateful. And thank you Stephanie Perkins for creating these amazing characters and this heartfelt story. You have set the bar high and I am looking forward to reading your stories for many years to come.
B003Y5H542|1.0|This DVD was played at the mall as a demo of the Sharp Aquos TV.... The graphics were amazing and I bought the disk without reading reviews about it... It stars with some cute bits but for the most part is just BORING....  it is a nice way to see how well your big screen TV puts out a high quality image but you are likely to shut it off and look for something else to entertain you.. I have no idea how kids would enjoy it ?
B0028RXXE8|4.0|A friend recommended this series, stating \\"you can't stop watching\\". Like the book that keeps you up all night reading, this HBO series of Julius and Augustus Caesar captures your interest.<br /><br />Howbeit, the series has serious shortcomings. It doesn't hold up to repeated viewing. Second, the colloquial British diction detracts from the action if you aren't British. Third, the domestic problems of Lucius Vorenus are insipidly melodramatic and tiresome. A fourth shortcoming is the abusive Forrest Gump theme: two simple Roman soldiers (Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo) repeatedly appear at crucial moments in Roman history and unwittingly exert immense influence: (eg, \\"How Titus Pullo Brought Down the Roman Republic\\", etc). While these two characters are very believable as portrayed, their deus ex machina appearances throughout twenty years of Roman history simply are not believable and are improvidently overdone. Such fusion of zany black humor with otherwise serious history *could* impart charm, but the humor is so overdone that it contaminates by dramatic osmosis other scenes that demand a serious tone. (Imagine Saving Private Ryan peppered throughout with brief snippets of McHale's Navy, or recall Jar Jar Binks in George Lucas's Star Wars prequels.)<br /><br />On the plus side is the graphic portrayal of pre-Christian pagan values: These are hard people without sentiment for whom sudden death and chronic mayhem are daily occurrences taken in stride. One might meaningfully say they are spiritually dead people. Whether ancient Romans really were this scorpion-like and amoral is problematic, of course, but it's certainly refreshing to see a genuine attempt to depict an ancient culture *without* modern Humanist/Christian values.<br /><br />The casting, overall, is superb. The characters are lifelike depictions consonant with Plutarch's Lives, Shakespeare's plays, and the historical record generally. Although Julius Caesar obviously is whitewashed into near-sainthood, you nevertheless can imagine you really are encountering the great man's spirit through the inspired acting of Ciaran Hinds. David Bamber as Cicero and James Purefoy as Mark Antony are doubly superb.<br /><br />Again, while I don't feel Rome holds up to repeated viewing, this series is pretty amazing nonetheless. If all films were of this caliber, it would be a very different world., you nevertheless can imagine you really are encountering the great man's spirit through the inspired acting of Ciaran Hinds.

0316010669|3.0|This book is enjoyable, like all of Malcolm Gadwell's writing, but some organizational problems torpedo the main message. It's NOT to trust your instincts; in fact it's almost the reverse. It's that a few key data points can help you make a decision, provided that you have identified those data points through good research or you have enough experience to know what they are. And often the data points that really matter are not obvious.  For example the coke/pepsi chapter shows that first-glance instincts tell a non-expert that Pepsi is better than Coke, because a non-expert doesn't understand that in the long run, sweetness will reduce enjoyability. The art experts are able to identify a fake on instinct only because they have a huge set of experience that gave them the ability to figure out what information actually matters, not because instincts matter more than logical analysis.<br /><br />The problem is that this point (find out what data points ACTUALLY matter and then you can make quick, good decisions) is not explicitly stated. I blame a lack of good editing, or sloppiness in a rush to publication, or a desire to being the book with a catchy story even though it misleads. It would have been much better to launch and frame the story around the heart attack data---experts thought that age, gender, smoking, etc. matter most in detecting a real heart attack when they didn't.
B005GVW05Q|4.0|Since we last heard from Ryan Adams on the 2008 \\"Cardinology\\" album (\\"remember that \\"III/IV\\", released in 2010, was actually recorded in 2006), a lot of things have changed for Ryan: first and foremost he got married (to Mandy Moore), he disbanded the CArdinals, took a break from the music industry altogether, and then started his own label PAX AM. Now we finally get the return of Ryan Adams.<br /><br />\\"Ashes & Fire\\" (11 tracks; 43 min.) starts off intimately with \\"Dirty Rain\\", which really sets the tone and atmosphere of the album. There isn't a single \\"fast\\" or \\"hard\\" track on here. Instead, Ryan is showing himself at his most intimate, and sounding relaxed and confident. If anyone is looking for \\"singles\\" on here, with melodic hooks, this album surely will disappoint. It's hard to pinpoint to highlights as such, as the album really plays as an entity. My personal favorite tracks, though, if I am pressed to name any, would be \\"Do I Wait\\", a ballad that resontes well long after it's over, the title track (sounding very Dylan-like), \\"Invisible Riverside\\" and \\"Lucky Now\\". In all, this is quite the album, but definitely not for anyone in a hurry. The days of the \\"Gold\\" or \\"Rock 'N Roll\\" albums, they ain't.<br /><br />I caught Ryan Adams a few weeks ago here in Cincinnati, and what a show that was. Just Ryan with his acoustic guitar, and on the piano for a few tracks. I had seen a couple of Ryan solo shows in 2002-03, when those shows were filled with smoking and drinking on stage, playing Madonna records on a vinyl turntable, etc., just insane (but fun, mind ya). This show was 180 degrees away from that. Intimate, yet beautiful. Ryan played a number of tracks from this album, including Dirty Rain, the title track, Lucky Now and a few others, along with many of the early classics. What a memorable evening that was. Meanwhile, check out \\"Ashes & Fire\\", you won't be disappointed.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game... full of puzzles, racing, shooters, timing games and much more. With this game you are not given all of the games to play when you begin, you must play the games well to earn coins in order to buy more games. In the beginning, it is fun and at times challenging, but after a while, playing the same games over and over just to get enough coins to get another game gets old rather quickly. Overall though, I have enjoyed it, and recommend it whenever you get mildly bored.

1592537251|5.0|If you are looking for a book of instruction on drawing, this is NOT the book for you. This is, instead, a book of inspiration. There are tips and tricks, equipment recommendations and other technical information to be sure. However, the bulk of this book is the collection of beautiful and varied sketches from contributors worldwide. Looking at this collection you can't help but want to grab a sketchbook and go out and try a sketch or two for yourself. The sketching movement has caught on rapidly and this book gives you a sampling of what it is all about. For the experienced sketcher it is both encouragement and eye candy. I know this is a reference I will dip into many times.
0439023521|5.0|I have been a teacher for nearly 18 years, and I have never had a novel that every kid in a class loved.  They keep asking me to get the next two.  I have kids that are not even in my classes ask me if they can borrow one.  I think the amazing details along with the compelling characters makes it one of the best books that has come out in a long long time.  Katniss, Peeta, Haymich, and all the rest nearly become real people.  The games themselves offer so much for lively discussions.  Lately much of the talk has been about the upcoming movie.  Here's hoping it will live up to the novel.
B004HWKWL4|5.0|My mother read this book, gave it to a cousin who bought 10 of them for her children and loved ones when they had a loss in their family. I heard what an impact it made on their family so I gave one to my deceased friends mother who had such a difficult time dealing with the loss of her son. It gave her peace and solace after reading the accounts of death and after life. She changed her attitude, and also raved about it. She had the rest of the family read it to deal with their grieving process.<br /><br />Recently I gave the book once again to a friend who was broken-hearted when he lost his elderly mother. He said it was one of the most comforting things he has encountered since the pain he had from loss of his mother.<br /><br />Unfortunately...I can not say I have read it yet. I have given it to many who have raved about it and were so grateful when they did.<br /><br />I guess its just me, I have not been to the point of grieving that I want to read the book just yet, I think deep down I want to save its first impact for a day in the future when I really need it to impact me most.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|After looking at many cases... this one really sold me. It has a Rubber core, which is brilliant since only and elastic material would absorb the energy from a fall/drop. A clear advantage over a fulky solid cover. The solid component its great, all the ports and gadjets are fully visible and do not steal from the gorgeous design. Finally both the audio jack and charging port are fully covered by the same rubbery core. Well worth the prize... definetely a must!

OH WELL NOT good..<br />The book has a good review the purchase experience was negative, customer service was nice but no resolve to issue... now no signed book either...<br /><br />The book itself is one of the greatest books written!!  My girl cried and I cried.  We both cried over the story and I would recommend this book to anyone.. A great read, very heavy.... Cancer is a very real issue and Cancer in teens is still a very real issue and very sad but still real... so this is a great read and will leave a impression on anyone who reads the book....if they can finish it due to the sadness and hard subject matter to deal with.  Life is a hard matter but when your dealt the hand of cards that include Cancer it all gets that much more hard.... so woman or man up and read it..
B005WMQ5R8|4.0|The beginning moments of this snime and I was only impressed by the high definition source as the rest just wasnt registering or they simply hadnt showed the wow factor yet, this was because my brian or taste hadnt adjusted to the viewtiful joe style cel shading.. Once it all processed in my brain and the story and action started in full effect it clicked and I was hooked and more then happy to fniish the anime. This anime has moments that are jaw dropping and the visual style quickly works its way into your heart. But do me one favor..Please for the love of god stop making AKIRA comparisions..Very misleading in every sense of the word... Only thing that might have been AKIRA-esque would be some of the BIO weapons in a breif portion of the film.  Long story short this is a must have for an anime collection, especially if you watch films on a HD Porjector..Beautiful Stuff.

B00447G2PM|3.0|I would really love to give this higher marks being as I am an avid 3d supporter/fan, However even though ghosting wasnt too frequent I got a case of tired eyes from this flick, ghosting was pronounced in a few instances as well but nothing that distracted for too long. It is hard for me to explain the issue I had with this film.. I could only describe this one as having hotspots on the outer edges of objects for quite some time. The picture was excellent in resolution and clarity with the exception of this weird effect I had from the 3d. maybe its because the strength of the 3d? I tried adjusting the 3d output strength to weaken it a bit but little help occured from this. I have noticed this effect more often in the earlier 3d bluray releases and its almost non existent in the later releases everything is crystal clear yet seems as though a haze effect is present and makes the eyes grow tired.  Dont get me wrong, the movie was still a blast and at times things came out of the screen especially the scene with the grouper fish and kelp in the kelp forest.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|If you're wondering if Season 2 is up to the high standards of Season 1, then rest assured the cast remains the same, the gorgeous photography remains the same, the writing is still Julian Fellowes, and the extraordinary study of the class system in England at the beginning of the last century is intact.<br /><br />As we were informed in the last episode of Season 1, World War I has begun and this adds a new set of circumstances to the Abbey upstairs and downstairs. There is considerable dialogue about the desire vs. the fear of going to war, and the British military strips many of the Abbey's dwellers for the greed of the war. Footman Thomas goes off as a medic, is unable to endure the stress, gets himself shot by the enemy, and moves back to the neighboring hospital to Downton Abbey as a nurse. There he cares for a blinded victim and his efforts are rewarded by being placed in charge of the newly formed/transformed Downton Abbey Convalescent Hospital. Lady Sybil continues her feminist beliefs and trains to be a nurse, Lady Edith has all but given up on finding a husband and so learns to drive a tractor for the farmer whose life was saved in the last season and also becomes involved as a nurse, Lady Mary still struggles with her on again/off again desire for solicitor Matthew, Carson still rules the roost, Bates' distant wife appears and causes Bates to leave Downton much to Anna's displeasure and the disappointment of the entire staff and owners , and the entire season continues to be influenced by the steady performance of Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess of Grantham!<br /><br />The war affects the family of the Abbey in many ways, not the least of which is the loss of William whose valor saves Matthew from dying on the battlefield.  Lady Mary's secret liaison/tragedy still haunts her and directs her toward an unwanted journalist Richard Carlisle who blackmails her into promising to marry him (Lady Mary still loves Matthew despite Matthew's move from invalid due to his injury to his decision to marry Lavinia.

The haughty O'Brien continues to side with the returned Thomas but also is devoted to the head of the household Cora, Lady Sybil becomes a nurse - a feminist move - and is enchanted with the chauffeur.  The war ends and the effects are felt in every corner.  The Spanish Flu of 1919 enters the confines of Downton Abbey and alters the story considerably.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Like Job, the George Clooney character faces one brutal loss after another. We begin with his wife on life support the victim of a misguided motor boat race. As the film proceeds, we find that the impetuous wife has done all sorts of things, some which will remain secret so as not to ruin the plot. We also find that his two daughters, age 10 and 17, are behaving in many self-destructive, neurotic ways, which the father must contend with even as his wife lies on the edge between life and death.<br /><br />The overriding theme of this gem directed by Alexander Payne is how we endure suffering. You can see the weight of the world on George Clooney's shoulders as he descends deeper and deeper into misery and while tempted into bitterness and spite,  we see a man stake claim to his humanity for the sake of himself and his children.<br /><br />As the father decides to be spiteful or accepting for the many betrayals he encounters, I was reminded of a Louis C.K. show where he tries to dissuade a depressed friend from committing suicide. He says, \\"Your life is not your own. It belongs to your family, friends, and society at large.\\"<br /><br />I felt the Clooney character came to this realization.  All of this is done without being bombastic and preachy. Rather, the film is mostly funny and sad, a typical duality from Payne who did the same in Election and Sideways. This is the best Clooney performance I've seen. Every scene you see a man gaining greater and great gimlet-eyed wisdom. Highly recommended.

On a more serious note, it was a very funny book but also had some great points about women at work, being a working parent and politics. I was so amused that I spent the second half of my day reading it instead of doing useful things like laundry and cooking dinner.

Each year, two representatives (ages 12 - 18) are selected by lottery to take part in The Hunger Games where they fight until the death and only one person survives.  I viewed the sample, immediately bought it, and tore through the first book, bought the second, and am currently on the 3rd.  All I can say is \\"Wow!\\"  Suzanne Collins has created incredible characters (from our heroine, Katniss Everdeen, to her little sister's cat, Buttercup).  I was surprised when I saw that the target audience was young adult.  Don't let that deter you; these are great books and you never feel as if you are being \\"talked down\\" to.  As you'll have read from other reviews, these are not bright, happy stories.  I am extremely happy I found this series and look forward to anything else written by Ms. Collins.

0375714839|4.0|An honest, funny and sad look at a young girl's life in Iran. I read the first volume and liked it so much that I read the complete book. I enjoyed learning about life behind the veil. Marjane's child self was very engaging and even impish, but as a teenager she changed and began doing things that she regretted - I found the honesty refreshing.  The story feels especially moving because it focused on inner monologue and dialogue between characters while the medium means it didn't sacrifice any action.  It's interesting because it is easy to read and seems simple because of it. But as you start to reflect on the events and emotions portrayed, you realize it has a lot to say about rebellion, loss, moving away from your family and the many different ways that humans behave.

After becoming BIG fans of them seeing their leads in Love Never Dies it was great to see them in the original.<br /><br />The extra treat at the end with 5 (6 with Michael Crawford) on stage is SO GOOD. John Owen-Jones is a favorite (along with Ramin)and it was super fun to see them all on stage at once! LOVE IT. No Phantom fan will be disappointed. Just wish I didn;t have to wait til June for Love Never Dies! :)<br /><br />It answers the age old question, if we put live musicals out on DVD, will anyone still go to the live shows. I've seen Phantom multiple times and will go back to see it the next time it comes around. The DVD is just a FUN fill in until then! Enjoy true fans.

B005I4JG80|5.0|I've read Druckerman's book several times over, yellow-marked it, underlined and dog-eared it. I don't have kids, but I have observed French children and wondered at their calmness and good behavior. This book answers many questions about French culture in general and French eating habits in particular. Why are French women thin? The answer starts at the family dinner table and in daycare. Plus it gave me insights into my own upbringing. Bringing Up Bebe is a thoughtful observation of how another culture resolves raising children. The French government is certainly involved in supporting working parents in the process. Would it work in the US? As Druckerman notes the US army already provides French-style daycare for all of the armed forces so it is feasible. Something worth considering. By the way this is a very entertaining funny book to boot.
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|I was on a business trip and my colleague wanted to go see this movie, so I agreed. I had seen the previews and was expecting a completely different film. The marketing team who decided to bill the movie as \\"the comedy of the year\\" should be smacked upside their dense little heads!! They so misrepresented the movie, that they destroyed it in the marketplace. The film itself was beyond delightful. I really connected with the characters on a human level and felt the story was warm and enjoyable. The cinematography was fantastic and I found myself wishing more people would get an opportunity to experience this film as it truly is. I so enjoyed the film, that afterwards I called many of my friends and recommended the movie as I simultaneously corrected the misleading previews. I mean the film is great, it is as if the marketing team was embarrassed by the story and decided to \\"candy-coat\\" the movie. A real shame because the acting, writing, and filming stand on their own as a fantastic, all around feel good flick! Although I would not classify it as a \\"comedic-romp\\" you will laugh, and more than that, I bet you will really feel super when it is over!! (I loved the snow owl and the eagles! Awesome footage!)

1847665691|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moI7060DNTLAS2]]LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND FIRMS EXPLAINED - AND BY THE WAY, WHAT EXACTLY IS A `PARTNER?'<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Clarification is the aim and raison d'être of this superb work of reference which is not only thorough and scholarly but readable too and, therefore, of immense value to practitioners or their clients involved with LLPs, limited partnerships and firms.<br /><br />The nature of these entities can be complex if not confusing.  We don't know that many lay people who realize - as author Mark Blackett-Ord remarks in the Preface - that<br />LLPs (limited liability partnerships) are not `partnerships', nor do they have `limited liability.'<br /><br />The fact that they are generally tax free and that they generally shield their members against negligence claims is what makes them popular. The legislature applies most of the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 to them, but the judiciary treats them as partnerships.  Confused?  You won't be when you read this book. In this the latest edition, published recently by Bloomsbury Professional, these points are clarified in the relevant chapters, namely Chapters 24 and 25.<br /><br />Certainly the very nomenclature inherent this fascinating area of law inevitably generates confusion, as certain terms have shifted in meaning over the years.  A `firm', for example, has a specific meaning (clarified in this book), but newspaper editors and other media folk, for reasons of convenience and space probably, are using it to describe just about any kind of `company', including PLCs.<br /><br />As for the word `partner,' the authors seem resigned to modern realities, if somewhat annoyed by them,  remarking that when the first edition of the book was written, the term \\"partner\\" meant `someone with whom you did business, not someone you went to bed with.'<br /><br />In the brief, but intriguing `Other Entities Akin to Partnerships' section of the book, the sub-section on `Marriage; boyfriends and girlfriends states unambiguously that `unmarried couples are commonly called `partners', but their personal relationship does not make them partners in the legal sense.'<br /><br />Well, point clarified here -- and point taken; another example in our view, of precise and analytical legal minds striving for clarity, while the public, press and media of course, cheerfully and heedlessly muddy the waters.<br /><br />We mention all this merely to impart a flavour of this wide-ranging work of scholarship,(of almost 1,000 pages)  with its extensive coverage of every aspect of partnership law, as a quick trawl through the table of contents --  and the index of over 60 pages will reveal.  Research resources abound, including almost 100 pages of tables of statutes, statutory instruments and cases, together with ten appendices.<br /><br />The law, `stated in our opinion only,' as the author puts it, `is intended to be as at 1 November 2011.'<br /><br />We can't resist quoting what the author has quoted from the translators of the King James Bible (1611) about the savagery of public comment if you put anything noteworthy before the public at all:<br /><br />`Whosoever attempteth any thing for the public...the same setteth himself upon a stage to be gloated upon by every evil eye, yea, he casteth himself headlong upon pikes, to be gored by every sharp tongue.'d girlfriends states unambiguously that `unmarried couples are commonly called `partners', but their personal relationship does not make them partners in the legal sense.'  Well, point clarified here -- and point taken; another example in our view, of precise and analytical legal minds striving for clarity, while the public, press and media of course, cheerfully and heedlessly muddy the waters.  We mention all this merely to impart a flavour of this wide-ranging work of scholarship,(of almost 1,000 pages)  with its extensive coverage of every aspect of partnership law, as a quick trawl through the table of contents --  and the index of over 60 pages will reveal.  Research resources abound, including almost 100 pages of tables of statutes, statutory instruments and cases, together with ten appendices.  The law, `stated in our opinion only,' as the author puts it, `is intended to be as at 1 November 2011.'  We can't resist quoting what the author has quoted from the translators of the King James Bible (1611) about the savagery of public comment if you put anything noteworthy before the public at all:  `Whosoever attempteth any thing for the public...the same setteth himself upon a stage to be gloated upon by every evil eye, yea, he casteth himself headlong upon pikes, to be gored by every sharp tongue.'
0060555661|5.0|Similar to the bible in that there are a few technical parts that haven't dated well but the overall message sheds light on human behavior and provides powerful, specific guidance on how to act that is just as relevant today as it was at writing. Actually, now that I think about it, it's much more defensible than the bible!<br /><br />A must read for anyone considering actively managing their own investment portfolio.  Out and out the best book I've ever read on investing.  I highly recommend this version with forward by Warren Buffet and commentary at the end of each chapter by Jason Zweig.  Zweig artfully ties Graham's principals to recent events and defends value investing in modern times.<br /><br />Graham's central thesis is as follows:<br /><br />An investors main goal should be to not LOSE money; To do this one must understand the distinction between 'investing' and 'speculating' and avoid the latter. Most so-called investors including a large proportion of professional fund managers are, on closer inspection, speculators who invest with little knowledge of fundamental value and a slim-to-negative margin of safety.<br /><br />Unfortunately, those trying to get rich quick without paying heed to fundamentals lose over the long term as major losses wipe out short term gains.  Graham introduces a few basic filters and analytical methods to assist in picking safe \\"value\\" stocks which should help the investor to avoid big losses and generate superior returns.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Graham explains where most investors go wrong and with what forms of temptation one must continually deal.  Indeed he does this at such great length that some might find the book boring and long-winded.  However, in my opinion it is time well spent as the ability to maintain process discipline is the biggest differentiator between investors over the long term.  Maybe I'm more interested than most, but for me, it was a page turner.

1400067936|3.0|Nassim Taleb has to be a strong contender for the title of Most Pretentious Author of the 21st century. Despite his obnoxious writing style, he has created an interesting synthesis of existing ideas that speak powerfully to societies inability to appreciate the role of chance when looking back at events, and to underweight the probability of extremely unlikely outcomes.<br /><br />Unfortunately these ideas come littered with classical references, none of them properly explained, that do little to strengthen the arguments and seem to have been included only to show the author's unrelated prowess in classical literature and history. The author also relishes his self-cast role of mis-understood and sidelined academic, laughable considering all his ideas come from the mainstream academic literature (see Randall Falkenberg's blog post for full detail).<br /><br />On balance, Fooled by Randomness is worth reading, perhaps with Google nearby to lookup unexplained references.

0743497465|5.0|This is a typical Dan Brown book in that all the action takes place over the course of 24 hours or so. Multiple crazy conspiracies are discovered; the protagonists get in the way of the evil people; and all is restored at the end. In this case, NASA is in play as the President of the U.S. wants to save it, while his opponent in the next election is running on a platform of extinguishing it. The book starts with a NASA discovery that could make all the billions of dollars spent on it over the years worthwhile. To ensure that this triumph is accepted by all, the President picks five people not known to be part of his campaign and with impeccable (for the most part) credentials to authenticate the discovery. The \\"evil genius\\" will stop at nothing to achieve his or her aims and the game, as they say, is afoot.<br /><br />While this book is big and long at 530+ pages, it is well written and the pages kept getting flipped very quickly. It helps that the plot is very engaging as are some of the characters that are brought to life. Oh, not everything is rosy. There are various places where you have to go \\"huh?\\" and there are several plot points that are clearly not connected, but who cares? It's still a thrilling adventure tale told with gusto and flashes of humor. Being a fan of thrillers of this type, I quite quickly identified who the culprits are likely to be and what the real deception is. However, even I was taken completely by surprise when the real \\"evil genius\\" was identified. Not what I expected at all and therefore kudos to Dan Brown!<br /><br />With any of these thrillers one must suspend one's disbelief and simply take it all in. The author does a good job of providing all kinds of scientific interludes in which he attempts to explain various phenomena. I am not a scientist and cannot vouch for whether any of these scientific explanations are plausible or even real, but I simply took them at face value and accepted them. Also, one has to leave behind all the coincidences that appear to take place and magically help our collection of heros escape from the clutches of the elite killers dispatched to elminate them. If the killers succeeded after all, the story would not have ended as it should.<br /><br />So, overall this book is an absolute winner and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the genre or needs something to occupy their minds. This is a great book to take on a lengthy overseas flight, or maybe on a beach vacation when you want to while away some hours with your brain disengaged from reality.

B004EPYZUS|4.0|best of the series. - most real, grittier, I think!<br /><br /> A movie where, for a change,  everything goes wrong again and again for Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and the ousted, disgraced, Impossible Mission Force for most of the movie but they win in the end, nevertheless.<br /><br />Much more teamwork than previous movies. Contains spectacular shots Tom Cruise hanging outside of the highest building in the world. This shots are done without blue screen, without a stunt double. Cruise said on Jay Leno he trained for 6 months to be able to climb up and repel down this Dubai tower.<br /><br />Done with much less special effects than you might suppose.<br /><br />I have seen this movie twice now, and it IS really the best action movie of the last year, IMHO. When al the other movies with blue screen are forgotten, this will be remembered.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|in the fifties and early sixties black maids/cooks in the Deep South worked (and sort of \\"slaved\\") for rich white women in big houses for rediculously low wages. Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis are wonderful as a long suffering black cooks and  Bryce Dallas Howard is over-the-top as an exacting rich white. In this movie the black women are shown as selfless saints and most of the rich whites are selfish demons (slave drivers?). Black and white, so to speak. A white outcast journalist, (Emma Stone) writes a book about how the maids are exploited.  Jessica Costain plays another white social outcast of the vindictive BDH.<br /><br />Having lived through this era in the South, the blacks, as depicted in this movie, are a bit too good to be true. I understand the book was a lot more realistic and showed a lot more sarcasm and shades of gray and in the black characters.... the white women? pretty much as depicted!<br /><br />A very entertaining movie nevertheless, and hysterically funny in places...<br /><br />Be careful when you eat pie.

B0059XTTW8|4.0|In the midst of Ian Fleming's James Bond \\"spy\\" romantic fantasy books and novels in the sixties came the real thing. John LeCarre, a former M.I 6 agent (England's CIA) then wrote the best and perhaps the only spy novels which accurately depict real spycraft. And one of the best of these is \\"Tinker Tailor\\", about Soviet Intelligence placing a secret \\"sleeper mole\\" (Russian agent) in M.I.6 headquarters, the Circus. Based on real events - Kim Philby was an agent in MI6 recruited by the Russia to spy for them.<br /><br />Gary Oldman does a creditable job depicting the master British spy George Smiley, brought back from early retirement to discover the mole within their rank of the \\"Circus\\". Writing is, of course  first rate, LeCarre himself was involved in the production of this Cold War drama. The movie runs more than 2 hours.<br /><br />But there was another version of \\"Tinker Tailor\\" where George Smiley was played by one of the greatest actors of the twentieth century, the late Sir Alec Guiness. For those unfamiliar with him, Alec Guiness played the superb Obi Wan Kenobi in the first released \\"Star Wars\\" movie! And the tortured British Colonel in \\"Bridge Over the River Kwai\\"! And hundreds of other parts indelibly etched on the memories of movie viewers. Guiness stared in this spectacular over 6 hour production of Tinker Tailor which really captures the essence of the book and is the greatest spy miniseries of all time. Guiness was so good as Smiley, that John LeCarre remarked that when he wrote subsequent George Smiley spy novels he always visualized his character as Alec Guiness!<br /><br />And that is the failing of this movie. In the six hour mini-series, the viewer sees each of the suspects clearly delineated and follows Smileys train of thought. In the Oldman version, all the suspects seem the same and many important plot details, even at a two hour running time, the plot is rushed. For example, when the \\"mole\\" is discovered, his interesting justification for why he betrayed MI6 and his country is completely missing from this version!<br /><br />It IS \\"Tinker Tailor\\", Oldman does a good job, but so much seems missing to me....Authentic spycraft, this is what spying is. If you like this movie (or if you don't), buy or rent the Sir Alec Guiness version and you will be blown away!<br /><br />Note: this is an adult movie.

B003YUC2FE|4.0|There's no real point in telling you about the movies themselves. Each are special in their own right, and the blu ray quality is really, really impressive. As I type this, I'm watching the first one, and the PQ is just great. It's a 17 year old movie that looks like it could have been released this year. Just fantastic. I love that my newborn gets to experience them with me. It's probably my favorite trilogy.  As to the packaging, I absolutely get the frustrations that others have. I original bought it because of the price discount I received using some of my Best Buy Reward Points, and when I saw it, thought it was worth it (looking back, it would have probably been around the same price to buy each movie individually, though). It's a cool little treasure box, but once you are days removed from owning it, it does become cumbersome. It's bulky, hard to store, and what I've learned is that I actually forget I own it when it's so easy to grab another blu ray package and simply remove the movie you want.  I reordered the way the discs are organized inside the box; first the blu rays, then the DVDs, and then the digital copies. The original order would have caused me to waste two minutes just looking for the disc I wanted.  I've even considered looking on eBay for each individual case for the movies. The fact that anyone is willing to pay additional money for cases should tell you something.  Do I regret the purchase? No, not really. I still own the movies, and I'm glad I do. Do I wish I would have just gotten the individual movies with cases? I have to say that I do. I got caught up in the nostalgia of having the treasure chest from the movies.  Since I do own the treasure box, I'll put it to good use by putting it in my baby's room for looks, but if you have the choice between this and another, more convenient option, go that route.
0312641893|5.0|I'm a sucker for old classics that are revamped and redone. There are always worries of course about doing it correctly but the minute I read the blurb about Marissa Meyer's Cinder, I was not one bit concerned. It seemed so awesomely different that I felt even if it didn't resemble the story of Cinderella, the uniqueness of the story would be enough. Well not only did it hit the mark on resembling Cinderella, but it was a totally awesome remake. I couldn't put this book down!    The Good: Firstly, this book made me incredibly jealous that I didn't come up with this idea first. I could not have thought of a crazier but more awesome combination in regards to a Cinderella remake. I honestly thought all of the characters were so well done and Meyer has a way with creating characters that really stick with you. I loved Cinder, Iko, Prince Kai and Peony. All the supporting characters were awesome as well. Meyer achieved the goal of making me LOATHE Cinder's stepmother as well as Queen Levana. The world building in this novel is incredible. It was so detailed and unique, and at some points, I almost felt like such a place existed. In kind of a scary moment, I actually thought that at some point in the very far future, we might actually have human's that are part machine. We already have people with artificial limbs...why can't some of the elements of the book actually come true? I thought it was fun to think of a world like this. I adored the romance element between Prince Kai and Cinder even though it was predictable. I still enjoy when the underdog is gushed about and adored. It makes all of us nerdy, underdog girls feel a bit better about our selves. Like if it happens in a really awesome novel, it will for sure happen to us. That's beside the point though, the romance was great because it wasn't insta-love. In fact, I believe there is more of the relationship to come in the next couple books. I thought Cinder's wit and humor was awesome and I just genuinely loved her and loved this book. It was really such a unique YA book!    The Bad: There weren't too many things I disliked about this novel but two things that really irritated me. The first one is that there is a point in the novel where Cinder has to go back to her stepmother after she's pretty much been thrown out. But Cinder is almost submissive to her stepmother afterwards! To me, it just doesn't mesh with the rest of her characteristics in the book. There were SO many other ways she could have not been under her thumb. But that's probably just a personal glitch for me. The other thing was the ending. The cliffhanger at the end was predictable and cut too cleanly for my tastes. If you are going to have another book, you need to make the ending just a little messy so it keeps the readers on the toes. I'm looking forward to the next books of course, but I wish Meyer would have ended this one with a bang!    Overall, I really enjoyed this novel and I can't wait for the second one to come out!! A totally new and fresh YA novel that I would highly recommend! A!!    **I received this book free from the publisher through  [...]. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

B000PMFTDQ|5.0|I must confess, for years I held dear a visceral and irrational dislike of Jessye Norman: my only exposure to her coming from Levine's 1990 Ring, which I have owned on VHS since way back when the words \\"HI-FI\\" and \\"VHS\\" could be said in quick succession without so much as a smirk.  I love that Ring passionately, which is probably why I passionately despised what I saw as its only flaw: Jessye Norman.  Her all-too-evident mixture of vanity and insecurity; her lackluster interpretation Seglinde's character.  Sure, you could hear that there was a great instrument there, but she did not seem able to play it very well.  No subtlety at all, just supreme vanity laid thick on top of a desperate insecurity.  (Which really should have prompted compassion in me, but I am not that good of a person.  A pretty bad one actually.)  Well, after listening to these \\"Last Four Songs\\" I understand where that vanity came from.  Who could NOT be vain when hearing such miraculous things coming from one's own throat?!  She lays every other interpretation of Strauss so far in the dust that is now impossible for me to listen to them.  As one reviewer said, Norman is \\"a force of nature.\\"  Absolutely.  Like the voice of God or something.  She's unbelievable -- I don't even have words.  Please, buy this one, and none other.  It just might change your life.

I found myself grinning in this book, a lot more than the other two. I loved their email banter and the tittles and signatures were very funny!  This series is just fantastic overall, it left me wanting more, but at the same time, happy that so many doors were finally closed and issues put to rest in Christian's life.  And, last but not least, that last bit at end of the book, from Christian's point of view was absolutely amazing. I wish I could read the entire series from his PoV, it would give us so much more inside into Christian's childhood and his sometimes \\"silly\\", sometimes \\"over the top\\" reactions to Ana's actions!

Gary Oldman's portrayal of Dracula as a monster cursed by love was a refreshing take on the count. Anthony Hopkins is the perfect Van Helsing: eccentric, sharp, and cunning..the perfect foe for the undying fiend. Everything in this film was practical. No CGI was used in this film. The special effects and camera trickery used give this movie an old world feel that helps to submerge you in this reality. I also enjoyed the historical tie ins to Vlad Tepes and the origin story of Dracula that make Bram Stoker's Dracula a must watch. Could have done without Keanu Reeves though. I'm sure that was the studio's choice.
B00777VT22|5.0|after a dry start, by around episode 8, it becomes apparent that this show is a modern day oudlandish soap with thrilling plot twists and lovably rotten characters.<br /><br />and no, episode 14 william devayne (from knots landing) arrives and u know things are going to get even more fun.<br /><br />by season two this show will be a monster hit.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|I've had this program work VERY well, and I've had it really stink.  It still needs a good bit of polishing, but I imagine a lot has to do with the quality of the PDF being used.  I wish I could use those SVOX voices on my Kindle.  They're fantastic.  And I wish I could use this program on my Kindle. Text-to-voice makes my daily commute my favorite part of the day.  PDFToSpeech has too, and since it works on my phone, I can read while I'm running or working out at the gym.  I love my Kindle... best purchase I ever made, but being able to read PDFs would be really helpful.  Sometimes I want to keep the formatting instead of just having one big unpaginated stream of pictureless text.  This program is also very limited when it comes to display, but I can't expect too much on a tiny little smartphone.  Anyway, PDFToSpeech developers... you've created something great.  I would be happy as can be if Amazon bought you guys out and kept you on staff to make the Kindle that much better. But if not, you're still one of my favorite Android apps. Keep up the great work.
B0073Q0DZG|1.0|If you must watch it, wait until it is free. This film is underwhelming in every imaginable way. Just because it's got Steve Martin, don't think it's funny. So old, so tired. Take my advice, save your money and watch something else.
0385535139|1.0|I wanted to like John Grisham's books again, but I'm sorry to say I won't be reading his books again. His early books, The Client and The Firm, I believe were 2 of his best.  He hasn't come close to that caliber again.  This book wasted so many pages on characters who were on the scene then never heard from again nor did they impact the story.  Even the main characters were going nowhere. Come to think of it, the whole story went nowhere. I was about a dozen pages from the end still hoping it would get better only to find it got worse. I'm not sure how this book gained a 5 star rating.  I can only assume 'getting paid for reviews' must be big business.  It's disheartening to see this book on the best-seller list.  Where have all the good books gone? -- I'm in need of a really good book.
1609611543|5.0|I can't begin to express how important it is for everyone to read this book.  Dr Davis does an extraordinary job detailing the effects that today's wheat has on our body chemistry. Most individuals have no idea of the consequences they face by consuming wheat. The best $27 investment I've ever made!  A must read!!  Dr Virgil Davis
B0058VW36U|5.0|I thought this game was a lot of fun. My only problem was that I got too good at it and finished it too soon. I would recommend this to everyone.
B00383ZTXO|5.0|There's another version of this on amazon, a remastered version with only one cd, and the sound is horrifying on that one.  This is the one you want, unless you want to go deaf.  Yeah, it's a great album, real genius and musical talent involved here, but you have to be careful that you buy this version instead of the other version here on amazon, which is un listenable.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|a lil hard to get points but I was excited at first... past time... now I play once in a while
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game continues to be fun. So worth the few dollars, I highly recommend. A great defense game for my phone.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|really enjoyed it. humor, heart and beautiful birds!  I had been waiting on a comedy that didn't have body function jokes.  This movie was exactly it.  thank you.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|IF YOU WANT AN ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER STYLE ACTION FLICK, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.  Whew, glad I got that out of the way. People need to stop reviewing this for something that it's not. Not this films fault that you went into it knowing nothing about it.  Blu-Ray sound and picture is fantastic. A well made film that deserves a spot in your collection. Tense and gripping.
B004RMNOW8|4.0|Modestly written, this book is an honest, beautiful, eyeopener. I personally think everybody should read this, it's a part of History which needs to be known about, written in a most exceptional way.  - Kelly Austin
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great time waster, but a little unpolished. Its fine for just screwing around, but people looking for an engaging experience should look elsewhere.
0007189958|5.0|I've been reading and re-reading this book since I was about eight! Following the story through different mediums such as emails, letters and texts effectively allows the reader to grow up with the characters, learn about them from a personal level, and feel the heartbreaks and accomplishments that every person experiences. Unlike many books written this way, I didn't find it remotely hard to follow, and found myself literally engrossed. I really love this book, it's beautifully executed and heartwarming.  - Kelly Austin
1416550534|3.0|I absolutely loved this book 80% of the time.  I can not give the book 5 stars because of the part about Grace getting a PhD!  Oh come on!  Grace spent her life in service and did not attend school until her , what, 50's?  I might have bought this part of the book if she had gradauted from high school and went on to teachers' college...but a PhD????  Grace's marriage is completely skimmed over with a few sentences.  Alfred re appears so what happened to the electrical company and his mouse of a wife?  At the end of this book there are many holes and many not answered questions.  Does  the fim maker realize she is the granddaughter of Hannah  It doesnt appear so?  A wonderful book  that was a let down at the end.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|Along with [[ASIN:B000642JG8 End of the Century - The Story of the Ramones]] this Queen DVD is my favorite \\"rock doc\\" of the past few years. I've been a Queen fan for decades, and this doc has plenty of great never-before-seen footage, tops being footage of the \\"We Are the Champions\\" recording session, and also the recording sessions for the 'Hot Space' album. Plenty of revealing interviews w/ all those involved, and never-before-seen scenes/outtakes from their music videos (\\"Crazy Little,\\" etc.). If you're a Queen and/or Freddie fan, do what's right!!
B0064NTZJO|2.0|This movie has about 15 minutes of good driving action an hour into the movie.  To get there you have to wade through an hour of wooden romantic narrative and lots of Ryan Gosling's stares.  They can be intense, or fond, but that's about the limit of his acting. Christina Hendricks is only there for about 10 minutes.  There was no character development, lousy music, and no motivation.  Looked like a film school project by somebody important's girlfriend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that some of the games are hard, but I really do like a lot of the games. I have not played all of the games yet but the ones I have played are really fun!  (Katarina Age 11 1/2)
159448385X|5.0|\\"... every Afghan story is marked by death and loss and unimaginable grief. And yet ... people find a way to survive, to go on.\\"<br /><br />This is one such story. It's the enduring human side behind the sensational media headlines that flash across our short-attention spans.<br /><br />Beautifully written, often lyrical, it's moving and gut-wrenching. More so because as you read it, you know it's not a unique story but one that has been repeated, and is being repeated today and will probably continue to be repeated in every poverty-stricken war zone, in every society where women are treated like chattel and where close-minded men are greedy for power and control.<br /><br />It's been quite a while since I read The Kite Runner, and loved it at the time, but I do believe this book was better.
0762777931|2.0|Really, the information is helpful and should a basis for a whole new way for everybody to eat to be healthy.  Too bad about the crude language.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|Liked the free version but you can't play beyond the first 10 or 12 levels due to ads blocking play field.  Well worth 99 cent download for hours of fun. Do have to be careful where you touch as app doesn't always cut where you pointed.  Otherwise smooth operating, no hinky permission requests. Motorola ATRIX.

B003Y5HWMW|4.0|This HBO series, somewhat reminiscent of The Lords of the Ring in plot and style, is based on the popular medieval fantasy books by George Martin (not the Beatles producer), The first season is basically about the struggle for power in the mythical Seven Kingdoms between two families, the evil Lannisters headed by the wife of the King, Queen Cersei (a fine performance by Lena Headey) and the more honorable Starks, who rule in the north of the realm, led by Ned Stark (a good turn as well by Sean Bean). There is a third dynasty as well, the Targaryen, related to the previous, murdered king, whose two survivors are the evil, bleach blond Viserys (a magnetic Harry Lloyd) and his beautiful, ethereal sister Daenerys (the petite Emilia Clarke, a revelation in a stunning performance). They live in exile among the savage Dothraki, a race of brutal, nomadic horse riders, and Viserys hopes that the marriage of Daenerys with their leader Khal Drogo will help him raise an army of Dothraki to invade the Seven Kingdoms, overthrow the king and put him in charge of the realm.  The series benefits from some great performances. Besides those I just mentioned, I have to add Peter Dinklage as the sardonic dwarf Tyrion Lannister, brother to the queen, and Jack Gleeson as the insufferable, cruel child heir to the throne, Joffrey. Not all performances in the series are remarkable, though: most of the Starks, especially Ned's sons, fail to make much of an impression.  The series has a very good start, then somewhat loses steam in the middle episodes, but rises again in the last two chapters for a rousing finale. I quite enjoyed the series, but I cannot call it a masterpiece. One problem that the many characters and the various, convoluted plots make it confusing at times. Some plot threads, especially the one in the frontier, could have been excised completely and the series would not have suffered. The stunning photography and locations certainly helps.
B003ES5ZTG|3.0|Super cable!  Love the fact that it's flat and that the actual connector swivels to make room.  Don't know if the internet component works because I wasn't aware that you needed a compatible device for it's proper use.  Solidly built.  Worth every cent.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Item does exactly what it's meant to, and I don't know how many times i've propped it upright while reading. I enjoy this product thoroughly.
B000002H4C|4.0|Classic soundtrack for a classic animated film. I always wanted to have this CD, and finally decided to drop a few bucks for it.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have the three main office apps all through Amazon. Office Suite Pro 5 is my favorite. The way excel is displayed sets them apart for me.
B0063IH60K|3.0|it.is a okay game. I do not think it.is a great game, but it is free so it meets that standard.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game was great. It worked great on the kindle fire and there were tons of levels. It was totally worth the money. I can't wait for Fire Maple Games to create another game like this.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This book was written from the dog's point of view. Great book. I laughed out loud and also shed a tear, something I don't usually do. This is a quick read. Highly recommended.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|For the price, there really isn't much you can complain about with this cooler. It keeps my processor temperatures (i5 2500k) nearly under 30C idle and under 50C on load, even when overclocked to 4.1 GHz.  The heatsink comes with a fan (obviously) and thermal paste, but I don't know how good the thermal paste is compared to others. You also may want a better fan if you like higher RPM's but quieter sounds, since this fan can get pretty loud depending on your fan-controller-settings, whether it be motherboard or a separate controller. I had to put the fan to run at 12.5% before I couldn't hear it over my case fans, but it still keeps the temperatures under 40C idle.  Installing it was somewhat easy, the hardest part is installing the backplate. If you have your motherboard in your case, it would probably be easier (assuming you have a cutout for heatsink installation). If you're installing it outside of your case, it can be a pain.  Something else I read constantly is that this doesn't fit a lot of cases. It is true, if you have a smaller mid-tower (not all mid-towers are the same, you know) then it might not fit, as it is a large heatsink. Measure first, complain later. In the CM Storm Enforcer, it fits with a few inches to spare in every direction.  Overall, amazing heatsink for the price.
B002BWP49C|1.0|This is movie is so bad that's it embarrassing to watch. I was sitting there with my friends and having to laugh at the HORRIBLE dialogue, the lack of face expressions and the pretty lame graphics. And for two people who are \\"soul mates\\", they sure are awkward around each other. The chemistry is forced and most of the scenes don't make sense. There is no flow and if you didn't read the book you'd be confused (just like in New Moon and Eclipse). The book Breaking Dawn was pretty bad but the movie is just a joke. It makes money because it's Twilight. Hot guys, Romeo and Juliet love, vampires... people eat such things up. But there really is nothing special about the story and it takes what's awesome about vampires out of the story.
B005EGXM7I|3.0|I watch this show on ABC Family and Love it and I really want to buy this set for my Kindle Fire, however I'm torn because the price for the box set for the Kindle edition is double the price ($32.99) of the actual book set in paperback ($18.99). Why is this? We already bought the Kindle's and now we have to pay double to get the books we wish to read on the already paid for Kindle? I find this a bit unfair.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love that I can pick from different versions.  navigating is very easy and the audio feature is a great asset!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is fun, but a little boring sometimes :) I do enjoy this game though, because of the many different games you get to play! :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I liked it at first but after a little while it started tovget boring I would suggest this app to people who normal like the same games for a long time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Instead of getting a whole bunch of apps this one has more than one and it helps kids spend coin wisely
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The Marware Microshell Cover for Kindle Fire was a good purchase for me and does everything I needed it to do. It is strong enough that it doesn't feel like it is going to tear from normal use, and it is flexible enough that it can easily be opened to allow access to the Kindle Fire whenever I want. It keeps all dust and dirt off the screen, and it is quite easy to clean on both its outer shell material and its inner plush fabric. It makes a cozy home for my Kindle Fire.
B005Q1W10A|2.0|I found season one for Downton Abbey to be a real masterpiece.  However, after watching season two, I was quite disappointed.  Each episode and in fact, the whole of season two, came across to me as \\"rushed, poorly put together, poor scripting.\\"  Everything I loved most about  season one, I found lacking terribly in season two - cinematograpy, character and story development, etc.  I hope Julian Fellowes and company take their time on season three and restore Downton Abbey to its original \\"masterpiece\\" status.  Do away with these trivial sub-plots!
0452273331|4.0|I tried four times in my youth to get into Ayn Rand, and failed after a couple of hundred pages each time. Now I have read both Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and have become a fan. Some of the long diatribes of her \\"Rationalism\\" philosophy can grow a bit dry and redundant, but I found that I could leave them for a moment and skip forward to the main story line, then return without losing the meaning of the philosophical statement.
0062082353|5.0|This book is excellent. I recommend reading by former military men and women from any branch. Kyle is an American Hero...
0553801473|5.0|Like the preceding books in this amazing series, \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" is rich, twisty, gritty, and totally engrossing. It comes through on Martin's promise to return the reader to the lifelines of major characters that were largely missing from \\"Feast of Crows\\". Unfortunately, many of the major characters that are most appealing (at least to me) remain at points in their lives where they are not involved in the central picture in any discernable way. In other words, although things continue to happen in their lives, they are not moving the overall picture forward. (I cannot get specific here, without spoiling the story for someone...)<br /><br />I am also unhappy to say that this book, like the others in this series, ends without an ending. In some great series, the author manages not only to write an overall story arc that ends satisfyingly, but also manages to make each book independent, and satisfyingly ended unto themselves. (Barbara Hambly's series that begins with \\"Dragonsbane\\" comes to mind as a magnificent example. Sharon Shinn's Archangel series is another example, though Hambly, I have to say, is the writer with far greater \\"range\\".) When a reader already knows that it may be multiple years before the next book, that's downright cruel!<br /><br />But this is a story well worth a bit of suffering! I will definitely be in line at the end of the 5 years or whatever it takes to get to the next book.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|This film has about all you could want;romance,a novel and interesting story, atmosphere, and fine performances by all.Curl up on the couch with your girlfriend and enjoy the show.<br />\\"Life and Death, space and time, fate and chance...from the furthest corners of the world where the dark arts still hold sway...I give you Eisenheim.\\"<br />A wonderful yet underappreciated film.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Very useful if you want to add optional music sources but have an older / plainer car. Beats one of those noisy cassette adaptors. Good that you can preset four different FM stations and you have the whole FM band to choose from. Takes three different inputs: SD card, USB flash drive, 3.5 mm stereo plug. Functional remote so the driver doesn't have to read the screen or find the tiny buttons. It has 6 volume levels to help normalize it to your in-dash source. Aside from the bookmark feature, turn the device back on and it starts where it left off when when you shut it off.<br />I am dropping satellite radio and was seeking an option, this is it. Nice product, works as advertised, hope it lasts.
B004FOA84A|2.0|game has good graphics, but I was able to finish it in about 30 minutes.  I think it should be free.
B0062NAX1U|2.0|This movie never really set itself.I didnt know if any of the officers were Christians,when did they repent?The Kendricks stereo-typed severly,all the drug users are black or''white trash''.You actually want me to believe there would be no swearing in this movie?The first scene shouldve been loaded with swear words been said by the guy trying to steal the truck.The plot was thrown around all over the place,shove it up your giggy acting and over-dramatization.No gospel at all,they made me strecth to believe that if were referencing to the gospel in a scene or two,why couldnt they just give me the gospel?Typical modern christians,and then they just kept talking and talking..........snoring........ and the actions scenes were BLAH!!!!!!!!!!!! AND THEN I FINNALY GOT TO THE END AND,THAT LAST SCENE, UGH!!!!!I see the same actors from the other movies littered in the audience of their mega-choir and mega-church.I admit,i chuckled once during the movie.But it was a Tyler Perry white vesion movie,I want my money back!!!!
B005H29GSI|5.0|I actually bought this game to use the pieces to decorate a birthday cake for my son's birthday. It was perfect and made the cake look awesome and as a bonus the kids loved playing with the game after. If you have kids that like angry birds this is a fun alternatiive to playing it on the screen.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|The only reason i read this book was because my nine year old brother was reading it and wa saying that it was nothing like the movie so i was wanting to know what it'd be like. When is tarted readingthe book it was kind of like the movie but when i got further through it was absolutely nothing like the movie and in fact i liked the book so much more it wasso interesting and after this book i just had to read the other ones and i only recently found out theres like a second series but it isnt about percy really i dont think.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Just got this app and started playing, hoping it gets better,  but for free can't really complain. The kids really like it though.
0060763280|5.0|This is a very good book that delves into the mindset of becoming a millionaire. According to the author there are a lot of things in our own mind preventing us from becoming wealthy. This was a good book.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I recieved my kindle cover and love it. It looks like I carry a book wtih me still and it is very sturdy. I would definitly recommend this item
B006UG90RM|5.0|not much to add here but I wanted to convey how impressive Wolfie is to me in this album.  In every VH album to date, it's like Eddie and Mike were a motorcycle and sidecar, locked in together.  Now the sidecar has broken off and is weaving through traffic for stretches before locking back in. He ably keeps up with Eddie but adds so much more.  This meandering, full, low end wasn't there in the early albums, and it fits excellently and challenges the listener in a way not seen before by this band.  I totally understand and appreciate everyobody missing Mikey.  I miss him too.  If it were anyone else, I wouldn't understand what Ed is thinking.  But this is Eddie's kid, and until you have your own children, you have no clue how much love is there and how everything and everyone else takes a back seat.  Plus, the kid can play (and do a pretty spot on vocal impression of Mike).  Mike is such a class act that I'm sure part of him understands this.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a keep busy game for the kids its not a game you would want to play for a while consecuatively
B0054JZC6E|5.0|although amazing unlimited coins would good in think it is very veryvey fun I loove the games there is something for everyone I just have fun

B006UG90RM|5.0|Kudo's to the boys. So glad there back with an album so strong after all the belly button years with Sammy. This album rocks!! Doesn't let up until \\"Stay Frosty\\". One of the best albums of the year I predict. I hope they win a grammy next year for it. The best album since \\"Woman and Children First\\". Everyone sounds amazing...Eddie, Dave, Alex and oh yea Wolfgang too. This is what I've been waiting for. Best of all...no keyboards. I'll be playing this one for a long time.
1594202842|5.0|Reading this book is like reading my own family journey.  For people who rated low on this book: First of all this is a funny, honest book. Amy didn't try to hide anything and certainly didn't try to depict herself as a \\"perfect\\" mom. You could disagree with her methodology of education(To certain extent I think Amy herself disapproved a few things herself after the fact), but you can't deny this is an excellent, fun reading book. I picked it up two days ago and just couldn't put it down until finishing it yesterday night.  Amy: Really appreciate the honesty in the book, you go girl!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun games. some are too easy but some really take work. its addicting. I especially like that sudoku is on here. maybe they could add some card games to spice things up
0307277887|5.0|This is the one that started it all.  The first season of the hugely popular TV series was based on DDD.  Will you like it if you love the series?  Yea and perhaps nay.  You'll like how delightfully warped and wonderfully hilarious Dexter is.  You might be miffed that the secondary characters, so essential to the success of the TV version, receive short shrift in the novels.  The books are all about the Big D.  And in this instance, that's enough.  It and the second book are the absolute best of the books to date.  So if you're tempted to test the literary Dexter, by all means, DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER is right up your serial killer alley.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|This movie is done well. The story and plot are feasible and perhaps the realness of it makes it somewhat scary. The breakdown of society and scrapping/fighting for food and survival. The Day 1 reveal at the end was good. I was expecting something more along the lines of a remake of \\"Outbreak\\" with the nice little fantasy of finding the host and the cure and all ends well before it gets too awful. Obviously that is not what Contagion is all about. An outbreak in today's world and the reality of how it will hit and hit hard. That is Contagion. Even though it was not what i expected, it was still a good movie. I don't normally like \\"reality\\" stuff...have enough of that in my own life and don't care to watch it in movies or television...but this movie was done well and was, if not enjoyable (because of the subject matter), then mind-turning at least.
1599218011|5.0|This book is amazing and wonderful!! Kris Carr and her wisdom is love, light, and life for all of us to be inspired by. I recommend this book to all of my friends, family, and clients. A must have for your personal or business health and wellness library.
B006UG90RM|5.0|It's finally here after so many years and I can't stop listening . These songs will rock your face off , and I don't care if some of the songs are from old demos . They wrote them and a good song is a good song .Eddie 's playing is top notch , Alex is great as usual and Wolfie does a great job as well. Dave's voice has aged but so what , he still delivers his unique style and it works. This CD was worth the wait . My only complaint is the production and mastering...it sounds compressed and a little congested as far as how the instruments are mixed. I miss Mike but oh well...they aren't getting along , will have to make do without him. A great CD !!
B006OAB3ME|1.0|I love Paul...but I just can't get into it...I mean, back in the day, when he was in his twenties I could get into him singing stuff like Your Mother Should Know, When I'm 64, Honey Pie...etc.etc...but his voice is not suited for it now. It sounds kinda lousy to be honest...I mean the backing musicians and Diana Krall sound OK...and Paul is trying hard...but his voice does not have the \\"sweetness\\" anymore for this type of music...'nuff said.

0312641893|2.0|SPOILERS POSSIBLE<br />Cinder by Marissa Meyer follows the story of Cinder, a gifted mechanic who is a cyborg. Then one day, her life is twisted around once the handsome Prince Kai visits her shop for a repair on his android. Cinder is suddenly in the center of an intergalactic struggle and a forbidden attraction.<br /><br />Though I figured this was going to be a clich&eacute; repeat of Cinderella, I figured it might not be too bad. Maybe the author would make a few surprising twists along the way. Honestly, though, there wasn't much to redeem itself.<br /><br />-The dialogue was cheesy and horrible. Not all of it, but a good amount of it. And it seemed after a few random conversations, Prince Kai and Cinder were suddenly madly in love with each other. Didn't seem plausible if you ask me.<br /><br />-Everything in the plot was so, so horribly, extremely predictable. I mean, as soon as Marissa brings something up as far as new and different, it's so obvious what's going to happen. Like a flashing neon sign it's so obvious. And readers aren't going to want to read something that's so obvious they don't have to read more to know what's going to happen.<br /><br />-The whole Lunar business was just... strange and pointless. Aliens? On the moon? I didn't see how it really fit or was really needed to the plot. It didn't seem like it added anything to the plot besides a plotline that didn't make much sense. If it wasn't for the Cinderella aspect and the plague that they had to deal with already, it might have been fine. But as it was, it was too much and seemed more like a way to make Cinder a Mary Sue later on.<br /><br />-I don't get how exactly the whole cyborg works for them. Cinder is supposed to look average, yet a good amount of her isn't human-it's machine. Is it obvious that they're machine? Or is it covered with \\"skin\\"? Or something that looks like skin? And if it's not, why not? It sounds like they have all these advances, so why not be able to create something that looks like skin to cover up the cyborg parts and avoid the embarrassment?<br /><br />-Speaking of that, why the embarrassment because they're a cyborg? Or why the judgmental treatment from others? That whole cyborg thing just seemed strange/odd.<br /><br />-If Lunar people are so powerful and strong, why haven't they just attacked Earth and been done with it? Why are they waiting for a marriage proposal that won't even happen when they're just going to destroy everyone anyways? They could have destroyed everyone a long time ago without waiting for the proposal. Just saying.<br /><br />-If there's this huge plague that's spreading everywhere, it doesn't make much sense to invite the entire city of New Beijing to a crowded ball. Where everyone will be breathing on each other. Where there's a stronger chance to spread a disease to everyone. Including the Prince.<br /><br />-How's the quarantine all that good if Cinder comes and goes as she pleases? A blood test and she's good to go? Um... but I thought no one would survive this plague. So when they see someone that is clear from it, they just let them walk out without doing anything about it? No questions asked? Even though she STILL CARRIES THE ILLNESS? I mean, she's the reason her stepsister was sick and ended up dying anyways.<br /><br />SPOILER-Why is it the Lunar Queen's blood is the one that heals, and you have drink that blood-eww-in order to survive this plague, yet Cinder, who is related to Queen, her blood doesn't work? Why not? Why is it just the Queen's blood that works? END SPOILER<br /><br />-Instant love with Cinder and Kai. Because, clearly, any handsome Prince or any guy for that matter only wants to fall madly in love with an average, awkward, strange girl the minute he sees her! And though she happens to be the only one who refuses to fall for his charms, she finds herself madly in love with him as well! Wow, what a shocker. >.><br /><br />The characters were more flat and boring than anythingelse. And I think it was just too much Marissa tried to mix everything together to make it work and it ended up a mess. A jumbled mess that was clich&eacute;d and just not done well. If it was simplified, it would have been a bit better. But as it was, I didn't care for it. It wasn't enough to recommend it or buy it or anything. If I feel motivated to read more, I'll borrow from the library and that's it.mess that was clichéd and just not done well. If it was simplified, it would have been a bit better.

1451627289|5.0|After our book club discovered that only a couple of us had ever read a Stephen King book, we decided to take on this one. What an inauguration it was! I got sucked in immediately and am not a fast reader, but it didn't take long to plow through this book. Now I wish I had slowed down and savored it because this is one of those books that is such an enjoyable experience that you're sad when it's over.  Aside from the historical fiction aspect, I love the bigger questions it poses: If you could go back in time to prevent a death or catastrophe, would you? And what would the effects of that action be?  I highly recommend this to anyone. Aside from my book club, I know of at least a dozen others who have read it, and every single one of them raved about it.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|I have been in love with Phantom since I was 14. I've seen the stage production live 3 times, I read Gaston Leroux's novel, I read Susan Kay's novel, I have the original Broadway cast recording memorized, and when the movie came out in 2004, I was utterly disappointed at what a lousy hack job it was. Living in Hickville, Florida means that the live production doesn't come around very often, and I was hoping the movie would be a suitable substitution. It definitely wasn't -- but THIS IS!!<br /><br />I thought that this was something like Les Mis in Concert -- the performers are in costume and there is some staging, and that's it. This is actually a recording of the entire musical from start to finish. There are different camera angles and occasional video editing effects to spice it up. Otherwise, this is like sitting in the orchestra section on opening night.<br /><br />All of the cast members are phenomenal. One of the biggest problems with the movie is that the words were there, but there was no emotion. Not so in this production. I honestly think that the roles of the Phantom and Christine are among the most difficult Broadway roles to perform well, not only because of the range and other vocal demands, but because of the huge range of emotions that each has to take on in a 2 1/2 hour period. Both performers were absolutely phenomenal in bringing their characters to life.<br /><br />There are two scenes that have huge significance to me: Music of the Night, and the graveyard scene. I suffered through Butler's performance of MotN once, and only once. I refuse to ever sit through it again because of how bad it was. Ramin Karimloo not only has a seductive, velvet-like voice, but he also portrays the internal struggle of the Phantom entirely through his subtle actions and facial expressions. He doesn't just stand stiffly and stare at Christine. Now, the graveyard scene has been botched both in the movie and in the theater. \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" is hugely personal to me, because I lost my father when I was 9. I know what it feels like to stand at my father's grave and want to move on but be afraid of letting go. I absolutely hate when actresses just stand there with no emotion except a sullen pout and maybe just walk around. At the end of the song, you can see that Sierra Boggess actually has tears in her eyes. She gives the song all of the fear, the anger, the desperation, and the hope that it is meant to have. During \\"Wandering Child,\\" there is so much intensity between the Phantom, Raoul, and Christine. I hate when directors cut it down to a duet and the harmony from Raoul's part is missing. I was thrilled to see this song performed in all its glory.<br /><br />The icing on the cake is the grand finale. I won't spoil it, because that was a wonderful surprise for me, but don't turn off the DVD player after the bows. :)lost my father when I was 9.

B005P78VK4|3.0|I'm very unhappy about the Earth Song on the Immortal Album, they took out the verse's about God's Son and alot of other verse's are missing. Michael would not have allowed this to happen. If you are going to record his songs get it right!!!! When I buy an album I want to hear the whole original version.
