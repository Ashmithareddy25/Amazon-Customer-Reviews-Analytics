B0000242CE|2.0|I beg to differ from some reviewers that the live renditions of some of the tracks on this LP are better than the studio versions. Some are, maybe but not all and this album definitely has its moments but is a bit overrated I think compared with subsequent live concerts the band did. I had the good fortune of seeing them live in 1985 and was sorry that the 1985-86 tour was never brought out on DVD or CD.<br />Part one of 'Alchemy' is tedious.  Too slow in the main, the instrumentals ramble at times and the weakest track on the set 'Love Over Gold' (which was not included on the vinyl version of the album) should have been left off - the original studio version of this track was definitely better; ditto 'Romeo &amp; Juliet' which also drags on. By far the best cut on the first disc is 'Sultans of Swing'.<br />The second disc is much better in the main. 'Telegraph Road' is superb and so is 'Tunnel of Love', these are unquestionably the best two tracks on the album. 'Going Home' is good too. <br />Knopfler's singing is weak much of the time.  The stage buzzes (which are especially audible on 'Private Investigations') can be a bit intrusive at times as well. Not my favourite live album by any means and certainly not among their best work.
B00005BJ2O|1.0|This CD does do exactly what a movie soundtrack should do - it displays all the songs from the motion picture to give you a vague idea of the story of the film. The film is absolutely incredible and never fails to entertain. However there is another thing from the film which this cd highlights - Nicole Kidman's raspy, thin, 'nothing' of a voice. Quite frankly i would have preferred a dub than to have her strain her vocal cords down a speaker at me! I am afraid to say that not even the magically rich scores of music which accompany her can hide the fact that she just can't sing! Ewan Macgregor does pull-off the role of Christian however, his high tenor voice is actually too bad. As my titel says, it is absolutely essential to  buy the DVD instead of this cd.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't understand why Fox cancelled this show. Firefly is one of the best TV-series ever. It is not just a good sci-fi but a great mix of different genres. I loved every minute of it.
B000021YQV|5.0|System of A Down can't be matched. They have awesome lyrics along  with some of the best combinations of drums, guitar and bass. Throwing their own cultural sounds into their music is also a great twist. Any one who says this band is bad, they are probably just some poser loser listening to bands like Rage Against The Machine or Good Charlotte. This is the band of the new age. I urge you to buy this cd along with Steal This Album and the original self titled cd. Believe me, once you've heard this band you won't be able to resist their greatness!
B00009V7RF|5.0|This cd is a really good cd, cause it has all the songs that will just make u jump. All the people in the Black Eyed Peas has a personality, and it shows in their music. And Elephunk is probably the best cd out of all of their cds. The music world would be nothing without the Black Eyed Peas, Elephunk.

1400031362|3.0|Like so many other readers, I really enjoy McCall Smith's stories of Mma Ramotswe, and her Botswana detective service.  Mma Ramotswe is a remarkable character, and I love her simple and moral nature.  Yet, of the three books I have read in this series, I found _Morality for Beautiful Girls_ to be the weakest story so far.<br />Mma Ramotswe is pulled in many different directions in this book, and only a few of the circumstances really go anywhere.  Nearly a whole chapter is devoted to a young boy that is found outside of town, and he is subsequently sent to the &quot;orphan farm&quot;. The matron of the orphan farm, Mma Potakwani, asks Mma Ramotswe to investigate the boy's past, yet that story line fails to go anywhere.  Why spend so much time developing a story only to drop it in the end?  I was left disappointed, and can only hope that this mystery is revisited in the future.<br />Another large loose end: what happened to Mr. J.L.B Matekoni?  In the previous books, he is a main character, however in _Morality for Beautiful Girls_ he is given little face time.  The book did not tell us what brought Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's depression, and once again, are the readers going to be told what happened in the future?  Like Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, the children from the orphan farm, who played such a large role in _Tears of the Giraffe_ are nearly forgotten in this novel.  What happened to them?<br />Yet there were parts that I really enjoyed as well...  It is exciting to see the development of Mma Makutsi, and her ever-expanding talents and responsibilities.  I look forward to reading more about her.  I particularly liked her case with the beauty pageant, and her quest to find a girl in Botswana with both beauty and integrity.<br />Despite the obvious holes in this novel, I am still looking forward to reading more about Mma Ramotswe and the other characters in the future.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm not one to jump on bandwagons, but Evanescence has absolutely blown me away. I'm on board. This album is every bit as great as it has been hyped. There seems to be an &quot;either you love them or hate them&quot; label put on the band, and if that's the case, put me in the &quot;love them&quot; category. After hearing this album, (quite by accident; I don't listen to the radio) I had to buy it. I was disappointed to find out that it is their only released album. I had this hunger for more of their music. I luckily was able to get one of the rare copies of &quot;Origin&quot;, their first album. This album is better than Origin. I can listen to &quot;Imaginary&quot;, &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;, and &quot;Whisper&quot; over and over again. I also love the songs &quot;My Immortal&quot;, &quot;My Last Breath&quot;, and &quot;Haunted&quot;. There isn't a bad song on this album. They vary in style, tempo, and feeling, but are all great.<br />If you are skeptical about the Evanescence bandwagon, the only way to find out is to give it a try, but I must warn you, you could become obsessed. This music is great. &quot;Either you'll love it or you'll hate it.&quot; But be warned, if loving them is your category, the love you'll feel toward their music will be enormous.
1577311523|1.0|Although the book is well written and the author states his point intelligently, his ideas are unrealistic and virtually impossible to practice. The reason is:  human nature is complex. You cannot simply isolate memory and emotions, responsibilities and life from past and future. Furthermore, your past is your experience. It is obvious that \\"living in the now\\" helps, but Mr.Tolle and his \\"followers\\" make this whole thing into a religion. I am sure no one likes to think of his ideas as a religion, but it is. Unless you lock your self up in a monastery or go to a forest and eat grasshoppers all day, past and future are not only important but also essential to our societal and emotional survival. Outside a monastery, only a very primitive form of life, such as an insect, can practice Mr. Tolle's religion. To his orthodox followers, you cannot even talk about the past and cannot wonder about the future. How convenient.

B00005JMEW|5.0|If you like Quentin, you are most likely going to enjoy his masterfully directed revenge flick.  It is my favorite movie of the year, and the storyline is thrilling.  His cinematography is mind-blowing, switching to black and white, and anime in two segments of the film.  Uma Thurman does a great job acting as The Bride, who is left for dead (but thankfully not) at her wedding.  The movie is based on her revenge against Vernita Greene (Vivica A. Fox) and Oren Ishi-ii (Lucy Liu), two members of 4 in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.  They're boss Bill (David Carradine) is heard and barely seen in the movie, which unveils more mystery of this two part flick.  Quentin uses great music from The RZA and this movie relates to 70's grindhouse films.  Quentin uses his technique of chopped up story telling which is fascinating to watch unfold.  And for the movie buffs out there, Tarantino pays numerous homages to previous movies with one-liners and certain scenes. This is not a &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or &quot;Resevoir Dogs&quot;, but it is a tribute to old kung-fu movies and spaghetti westerns.  This movie is a terrific film and Uma is one ass kicking chick.
B00018D44U|5.0|This really sounds nothing like the first one, but is still worth the $$.<br />The cool voice of Norah always makes for a good listen.<br />I prefer the bluesier versions I have heard on the cd she used to have at her show before the popularity.<br />Back then she played what people wanted I guess, because the new album gives those songs a pop sound that I don't care for.<br />Still there are more moments on here than most artists' of today and all of the eighties.<br />Keep it bluesy!<br />Stick to your roots!<br />that's what got you here
B00005A46T|1.0|Slipknot will impress me when Opeth, Death, Morbid Angel, Early In Flames, Edge Of Sanity, Decapitated, Samael, Cannibal Corpse, God Dethroned, The Haunted, At The Gates, Agalloch and Early Emperor all die out. Which I'm inclined to say is not happening anytime soon. Long story short, Slipknot's Iowa will never compete with true death metal and the essentials (Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Slayer, etc.) This band, along with Mudvayne, Marilyn Manson, Korn, Static-X, Kittie, Helmet and Disturbed (though they have a great singer), are sadly, corporate sellouts. One more thing: before calling Slipknot `the most hardcore/bad@ss band ever,' let me tell you about a Norwegian band called Mayhem. They had members involved with self-mutilation and murder, and their late vocalist's suicide photo is on a bootleg CD cover called `Dawn Of The Black Hearts.' Just something to consider. Nu-metal fans are sure to love this release, but music fans should avoid this band at all costs. 10/100.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Having just seen Kill Bill, Vol. 2, I can confirm that the interviews and press reports are accurate:  By splitting one film into two, what you get are two halves that each has its own very pronounced merits, but need each other to survive.  In fact, I think if the two volumes had cross-pollinated a little more, you wouldn't have had just a good movie and a half, but two great films.<br />But for now, Kill Bill Vol. 1.  It's the &quot;action&quot; half of the twins, and it dazzles right from the start with an audacious, extended extreme close-up on Uma Thurman's face.  The scene after, the duel between The Bride and Vernita Green, is classic Quentin Tarantino, heralding a return to his outrageous, dramatically intense roots.  Probably the strongest scene he's directed since the Mr. Pink-Mr. White altercation in Reservoir Dogs.  Unfortunately, after The Bride wakes up from her coma, the dramatic content flies down the meter, with a lot of posing and one-liners but very little in terms of character or emotional satisfaction.  Which means it's up to the endless action set pieces to grab our attention.  And they do.  However, I find them a little too bloody, even though I've spent the last 16 months digging through Shaw Brothers films (through the excellent Celestial Pictures VCD and DVD releases).  The endless bloodletting in Kill Bill Vol. 1 is shocking in the beginning, but after about five minutes in the extended climactic massacre, it's numbing.<br />And for the record, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is not a Shaw Brothers kind of film, despite the Shaw logo which opens the film.  You would have to wait until the &quot;training&quot; sequences in Vol. 2 to get Shaw Brothers-style cinema (which Tarantino appropriates very well there).  Vol. 1 is much more a paean to the Japanese style of filmmaking:  Extremely saturated colours courtesy of cinematographer Robert Richardson (even Shaw films didn't go this far in terms of garish colours -- we're in '80s Kurosawa territory here), emphasis on extreme wide shots, the very long builds, the brilliant music by The RZA.  And the martial-arts sequences are modern in their multi-angularity and speed cuts; Shaw Brothers action as epitomized by Chang Cheh's style focuses much more on choreography and mise en scene than multi-angularity, letting long medium shots capture the movement of the actors and fighters, relying very little on cuts.<br />All in all, the most lacking element in Kill Bill Vol. 1 is still story and character.  Uma Thurman has some great moments (such as when The Bride first wakes up in the hospital), but after those blazing first 30 minutes, she will mostly become a statuesque hellfire angel who doesn't have a great deal of emotional advancement.  You will get that in spades in Vol. 2, which is hands down a superior story and film -- without the visual eye candy and endless action of Vol. 1, but with such powerful dramatic moments that it barely matters.  Again, I think if Tarantino had been able to meld the action and the drama a little more, rather than separate them into two movies that contain most of one and almost none of the other, he would have made both films greater than what they are.  As it stands, Vol. 2 will be what truly burns these characters and Tarantino's vision into your mind, while Vol. 1 is the adrenalized thrill ride with energy to spare, but without much in terms of thematic depth.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|I was in my freshman year at the University of Kansas when ABC premiered the movie in November 1983.  It was the Sunday and Monday before Thanksgiving.  Of course, as a native Kansas Citian and a KU student, I recognized almost all the sscenes shot in both KC and Lawrence.  I thought it was fitting to see the missles shooting out of the area between Wescoe Hall and the Military Sciences building. :)  I believe that I had classes in both buildings that semester.  The most striking scene of the movie was the mushroom cloud appearing over K-10 Highway towards Kansas City.  For those of you too young or say that this movie is now out of date, it was definitely fitting for the times.
0156711427|1.0|This book is what is known as a 'reading classic', not because of it's ability to entertain the reader to the point that the book can't be put down, but rather because of it's masterfull structure and poetic style. Unfortunately, Forster lacks so much imagination in creating the story it is unbelievable! Forster (...) fell in love with an Indian living in England prior to writing the book. This young man would tell Forster about India and it's culture fascinating him to the point he had to write a book about it. This is what A Passage to India is about and nothing more, the writers fascination with Indian culture during British rule. The story is painfull, I repeat, PAINFULL! absolutely nothing happens, there is no climax, nothing worth ever remembering. Unless you are an English professor forget it! Shooting oneself in the foot would be less painfull than reading this book.

0385333846|3.0|Note this is review number 433 of this book on Amazon....that says something, no?  I liked Player Piano and Breakfast of Champions better, but then I'm not into war stories.  <br />There are things to learn here, though.  Did you know about the bombing of Dresden?  I didn't.  I didn't know that more people died in the Dresden bombing than in Hiroshima.  Truman's speech, given verbatim in this book (supposedly, I didn't check) was very eye-opening.<br />So the value here, to me, was to learn a little history in a palatable and interesting story.  It's much better than trying to read it in one of those dull textbooks (whose authors should be ashamed and stop writing, or try to write like Mr. Vonnegut).  <br />By the way, what ever happened to Kurt's son, Mark, the one who wrote about recovering from schizophrenia?<br />Diximus.

0380729407|5.0|There is a dark veil hanging over this book and it absolutely scary. Scarier than some horror movies. <br />Ray Bradbury is of course one of the greatest sf/fantasy writers of the 20th century and if you have never read any of his books, read this one or Fahrenheit 451.<br />It has many dark and mysterious themes, a traveling show with many strange characters. It is about how people can play with time and how that may affect the souls of people. It could be, and I mean this positive, a Star Trek or X-Files episode. I wonder what the movie is like...
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Having lived in Japan for nearly 14 years, I was so hoping for a look at a country I love (like is seen in parts of &quot;Enlightenment Gauranteed&quot;). Instead I found this to be a depressing, non-acted film where the Japanese were made to sound stupid because Bill Murray's character simply didn't want to take the time to learn and understand anything about this marvelous place and its citizens. Here he and Johannson's character had the opportunity of a lifetime to enjoy Japan and all it has to offer and instead they were maudlin and condescending.  This could have been a good film...it was not but that may be because I personally know what the characters  missed. Regardless, I think the movie cast Japanese people from a less than positive vantage point which was offensive to me and I think will be to others.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Awesome cd. I bought it for the radio hits, and soon found that I LOVED all of them. The best incubus cd out there, can't wait to get my hands of A Crow. All the songs are great. BUY NOW!!!!

But even more importantly...the out loud, raucous laughter this movie causes throughout it's 2 hour run will definitely improve your health. Laughter IS the best medicine and this movie gives us an enormous dose.
B0000AGQ6P|5.0|Hook was my favorite movie when I was little, and it still brings tears to my eyes for the ending which leaves you with so many mixed feelings. With a soundtrack that matches the story up perfectly it is amazing how it tells such a good version of the story of Peter Pan, while adding it's own completely unique qualities.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Identity is the kind of thriller we haven't seen in a while from Hollywood, the Ten Little Indians scenario where a large group of people are being killed off by an unknown adversary and the suspense level rises until a significant plot twist turns the whole thing on its ear.  That's a good movie and Identity, which the exception of some minor hiccups, lives up to it.<br />A good ensemble cast, including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Rebecca DeMornay, Amanda Peet, and John C. McGinley, provide adequate amounts of star power and tension.  Director James Mangold has proven he can handle this type of material and cast as the director of Copland.  In this film he takes a limited location, sets his characters up well, and more or less lets things unfold as they will without forcing the issue.<br />The one problem is this - if you remember the commercials for the film that ran on television when it opened, they revealed a very important plot device that doesn't give away the big revelation, but comes damn close.  In addition, if you are really paying attention, it's not all that hard to guess what it is.  This isn't to say that it takes anything away from the film at all.  It's very clever and certainly holds your interest for the duration.  An argument could also be made that the ending feels tacked on, but at 90 minutes, there's no wasted scenes or extemperaneous dialogue.  The DVD does come with an extended version, as well as commentary from Mangold.<br />An excellent popcorn thriller.

B00005YXZH|4.0|I'm not the type of person to throw around 4 or 5 star rating because &quot;I like the band.&quot;  However, this album is one of the few released during the year that truly deserves recognition for the earnest effort put into crafting it.  <br />I'm also not one to say &quot;go out and buy this album, it will change your life!&quot; because, quite honestly, most people won't be able to digest this album.  If you want a bunch of hum-alongs without having to do any work, then stay far, far away.  This is for music fans who care about arrangments, compositions, added nuances.  Its for fans of Radiohead (and bands like these) where effort is required to understand what the band is doing.  <br />Its nice they have some poppy songs in there to give us some time to breath (Kamera, Heavy Metal Drummer, Pot Kettle Black, etc which are all thoroughly enjoyable on first listen).  But the real treasures are songs like Poor Places and Radio Cure which start off kind of drab and unimpressive, until we realize we're on a long journey which would be overwhelming without the building of tension.  &quot;I'm the man who loves you&quot; is another favorite, as the guitar gets a chance to air out a bit. <br />The only one that I still haven't figured out is Reservations...  it just goes nowhere, but thats ok.  There are a few sloppy moments here, and no one unified lyrical theme really so its not a 5-star album to me.  Just one of the best of the year.  If you like intelligent rock, this is for you.
B000002HMH|4.0|When deconstructed song by song, LOAD winds up being one of Metallica's least commercial albums.  Why then did so many chimps accuse the band of &quot;selling out&quot; when it was released?<br />Here's why: Metallica's music is complex.  Metallica's fans are not.  You know it's sad but true.<br />Selling out would've been making The Black Album II.  Instead, the band had the nerve to attempt growth and experimentation (the type of experimentation that set them apart to begin with).  This blasphemous approach alienated many of the pre-Black Album meatheads who wanted nothing but more barking and screeching solos.  It also disappointed many Black Album posers who wanted nothing but the kind of radio friendly tunes contained on the record that introduced them to Metallica in the first place.<br />If proudly inducing this kind of rancor was an attempt by Metallica to become more popular (i.e., &quot;sell out&quot;), then they are either retarded or just testing out a groundbreaking new business model.  <br />Maybe this approach will catch on.  Maybe Britney Spears will get fat to become more popular with the fans who only like her for her looks!  Maybe Bruce Springsteen will start bragging about his bling-bling to become more popular with his white trash fanbase!  Maybe Mos Def will do an album of Skrewdriver covers to further cement his black militant image!  The possibilities are endless!<br />As for LOAD's content, I can do without HJB and AMB.  Otherwise, I can listen to every track.  <br />P.S. &quot;Bleeding Me&quot; and &quot;Outlaw Torn&quot; are two of Metallica's finest tunes.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Wow!  Martin Scorsese has a cinematic vision in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; and sticks to the storytelling no matter how graphic, how violent, how revealing of the sometimes brash side of human nature.  We like to think of Americana happening somewhere in the Heartland with corn stalks, faded red white and blue from the harshness of the summer sun and winter chill.  What Scorsese shows is that the heart of America may not lie in Nebraska far from civil war battlefields, far from epic wars.  There may be a seedier side born of violence, a country carved out of war, but then not many countries are born of else.  Let me tell you what I mean.<br />&quot;Gangs of New York,&quot; has a deeper message than the simple retelling of a time in the mid 1800's in New York City.  It has elements of the forming of a country in mid-stride.  It has elements of America as the great melting pot or a country fought and &quot;died for&quot; by those feeling worthy of the term natives.  But then the natives led by Bill the Butcher Cutter (played brilliantly by Daniel Day Lewis), aren't really natives on these shores are they?  On the other side of the pitched fight, is Amsterdam Vallon (played less brilliantly but still compelling by Leonardo DiCaprio) as the leader of the immigrant Irish gang.  The battle between the two is broader than a personal vengeance, broader than a family feud despite Amsterdam seeking justice for his father's death at the hands of the butcher.  It is more about a fight for the soul of the country, a pitched battle where both sides suspend reason and turn to violence.  Each feel God is on there side so take the &quot;by any means necessary&quot; approach to prove that might makes right.  There are parallels to the Civil War ongoing but largely out of the picture in the gang war in Five Points slums.  There are even more modern parallels as in the closing scenes we see the New York skyline burning, in the fore frame a graveyard where Amsterdam's father &quot;The Priest&quot; is buried.  The New York skyline is time sequenced as the Brooklyn Bridge remains the constant, the graveyard grows weathered and unkept, the Empire State building appears, and finally in the closing scenes the Twin Towers stand.  There is a parallel to a battle currently raging in the present and New York again seems at the heart of it.<br />&quot;Gangs of New York,&quot; has a feel to it.  There's some Citizen Kane, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Braveheart all intermingled therein.  It is made to be an epic.  There is good and evil and then there are humans that display all shades of that continuum.  The final battle between the natives and the immigrants is waylaid by the pressure of the Civil War and draft riots.  The final battle becomes clouded and I feel is a misstep in the film.  It leaves for slight disappointment.  In the end &quot;Gangs of New York,&quot; will go down as one of Scorsese's more powerful movies and that says a lot.<br />--MMWe Priest&quot; is buried.

0784010528|2.0|It seems like every great director attempts a comedy at some point in his career.  Stone is no exception, and with THE DOORS, he makes an unfortunate foray into feature length hijinks.<br />Don't get me wrong...the film does have some funny moments.  The scene where Kilmer follows Pamela Courson home and hangs out in the window is a classic.  Pamela sees him and asks why he followed her, and with impeccable comic touch, Kilmer says &quot;Because you're the one.&quot;  Quite a sidesplitter!<br />Unfortunately, the jokes get old after a while, and by the end, you're almost wishing that Stone had taken a more serious approach to the material.  Even Morrison's wacky Indian sidekick ends up looking forlorn.<br />My advice, if you want to see a great musical comedy, check out SPINAL TAP.  As for Stone, he should leave the one-liners to Woody Allen and stick with heady dramas.
0316666343|1.0|The aftermath of a murdered daughter's family as she watches from heaven.  This could have been good.  But with the sagging melodrama that never goes anywhere until some amateurish contrivance for an ending, this is one boring read.  These great characters deserved more.  Pass on this one.
0066214122|5.0|I put off reading Prey because I was afraid it would be overly technical, dealing with nanotechnology as it does.  But Crichton has made this more of a people story with characters who are very appealing.  Jack is a former software engineer.  He is now a stay-at-home dad with three children.  His wife, Julia, is a vice president for a company developing nanotechnology.  The reader is quickly caught up in their everyday lives, then strange things begin to happen.  This is a fast paced, action-packed story.  Towards the end, it turns sort of Stephen King-ish, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The conclusion is non-stop suspense.  An exciting and scary read.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This fresh new album from billboard-topping rapper Kanye West is one of my favourite albums of all time. Working with people from Twista to the unknown female Syleena Johnson, he has created something amazing.

The best songs are We Don't Care (unlike what the tracklisting tells you), All Falls Down (the new single with samples from my favourite MC/soul/rnb/hip hop artist, Lauryn Hill), &amp; Never Let Me Down (featuring mega rapper Jay-Z). The singles will be Slow Jamz (which reached no. 1 in the USA and features Twista and Jamie Foxxx), All Falls Down (featuring Syleena Johnson) &amp; Thru The Wires (a top five success for him) - there has been no further detail 4 following songs from this album.

B00005JMEW|5.0|*Kill Bill: Vol.1*<br />Kill Bill Vol.1 is darn-near brilliant, no, I retract...it IS brilliant. Great editing and great acting really made me feel like cheering on, the highly under-rated, Uma Thurman. She is fantastic in this!<br />There is something about KB1 that, as the movie progressed, I liked more and more. It started off great and just got better. My only complaint is the way over-the-top blood showers. I'm not sure why he felt it neccessary for the blood \\"showers\\" but, if I had to guess, there's probably a reason, I just couldn't figure it out.<br />Strickly for action movie fans, and not for the weak!<br />2 THUMBS UP...easily!

B0000AQVCL|5.0|The album which catapulted the Aussie guys to fame. As soon as the first few tracks hit you, you know why. The album is mixed with upbeat unebelievably outstanding rock tracks and slow mellow meaningful tracks. You know when you listen to an album and your favourite song changes a few times, but thats it because theres only a few great songs on it. Well Get Born gives you 12 great songs that each individually could be your favourite.<br />Some people mention The Beatles when they heard &quot;Look what you've done&quot; and that must be pretty damn amazing for any band to have that said about them.<br />The guitar playing, to the bass and the drumming is absoloutly spot on with musical talent you could only dream of. The vocals are blasted out not only with style but with passion.<br />You get the feeling this album will stamp itself on the rock genre for years to come, a real rocking album which the music industry thrived for, which leaves me with just to say, Jet will be up there with the best there ever was.<br />David Cox
0345440900|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book.  Much of the breastfeeding information is false and can easily lead mothers down the road of insufficient supply due to scheduling.   It's Ezzo wrapped in a slightly more palatable package.  My advice?  Skip it.
B000002N2P|5.0|Green Day is the best punk band in the world, five times as good as blink-182, Offspring, and Sum 41 rolled into one!  Even though Dookie was their breakthrough into the mainstream, I am shocked to hear Insomniac was a commercial failure!  This CD kicks Dookie's rear from Earth to Pluto (maybe beyond)!  It rates with me as about a 4.99 (...) (points are lost because of the cussing).  Buy this CD, it is worth every penny.  Here are some ratings for the fourteen tracks it contains:<br />1. Armatage Shanks-Third best CD intro by Green Day, Right behind Nice Guys Finish Last and Suffocate.  Great drum intro, and powerful power chords.  Name doesn't make sense though, but what does that have to do about the greatness of the song? 9/10<br />2. Brat-Catchy song about a brat waiting for mom and dad to die to collect his inheritance.  Mike gives nice fills, but the song loses its genius after 5,000 times listening to it (especially when compared to what is to come). 7/10<br />3. Stuck With Me-See previous review, plus shouldn't have been on Superhits.  7/10<br />4. Geek Stink Breath-Cool intro and bridge. 9/10<br />5. No Pride-Not the best, but worth listening to. 8/10<br />6. Bab's Uvula Who?-Hated to song when I first listened to it, but one day, my CD player track change button wouldn't work, and you can guess what happened. 9/10<br />7. 86-Funny song about an old man trying to be young.  Good intro Tre! 8/10<br />8. Panic Song-Weird bass intro with random riffs happening during the first minute or so but gets better. 7/10<br />9. Stuart and the Avenue- WHY THE HECK DID THIS NOT MAKE IT TO INTERNATIONAL SUPERHITS (are they saving this for Volume II?)!!!  IT COULD HAVE REPLACE JADED AND STUCK WITH ME AND STILL MAKE THE CD WORTH BUYING!  This song has one of the best bass intros to a song-ever, with a great (but repetitive) beat belted out by the trio, and one of Billie Joe's best vocal performances ever. 15/10<br />10. Brain Stew-We all heard this song on the radio. 10/10<br />11. Jaded-Overrated and loses its genius fast.  Starts the CD's slight temporary drop in quality. 3/10<br />12. Westbound Sign-Cool at first, but not as cool now. 6/10<br />13. Tight Wad Hill-Just plain stinks.  Oh well, every silver lining has a few clouds.  Better than Jaded, however. 3/10<br />14. Walking Contradiction- Makes up for the last 2 tracks.  Funny music video too. 9/10<br />JUST BUY THE CD, OR YOU WILL BE ASHAMED TO CALL YOURSELF A GREEN DAY FAN WITHOUT THEIR BEST CD.
B00003CWL6|5.0|The main reason I wanted to add my comments was that I saw no other mention of Allison Janney.  If you are a fan of hers, watch for her understated and stunning, albeit small, performance as the timid mother of Ricky (Barbara Fitts).  This performance truly demonstrates the range and untapped talent of the great actress.  (Yes, I'm a big fan.)<br />Having said that, this film does start out making you feel your watching an overslick production of Hollywood banality.  Oh contraire (sp?).  My favorite films delve deep into character study and development (e.g. Dolores Claiborne, Shawshank Redemption, Dangerous Liaisons, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Sophie's Choice, Fried Green Tomatoes).  This film gives it to you in spades.<br />If you enjoy stories that make you think you've got everyone figured out, then prove you wrong...this is a must see.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is the first film by Quintin Tarantino I have ever seen and boy was it wonderful.  The man can make a perfect movie.  He takes you for a ride that you never want to end.  The plot, the action, the effects, the score, everything was wonderful.  The way he directed this movie was unlike anything I had ever seen.  I cannot wait to see the second installment.  Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah, and Vivica A. Fox all kicked but.  One of the best films of 2003, Tarantino has definately made a Kung Foo masterpiece.  This film is pure Tarantino.
0060528737|5.0|I thought that this book was really good it made me keep on reading it more than Lirael. It was amazing how 7 people could save the world from 1 really strong enemy. The only problem with the book was that it ended in a sort of cliff hanger. It left questions like what happened next in my mind. But besides for that I think this is a really good book that many people would enjoy.
B000001Y9I|5.0|Fisrt this cd starts off with one of my favorite tracks ted the mechanic. I heard on thr radio a few times 7 or 8 years ago, but the rest cd is as just good as opening track. There isn't a real weak track on the cd. It's a little different from the Blackmore era..this one maybe not as firey guitar or classic songs but overall I think it's better than most of the purple cd's all the way through.
B0001AP12G|2.0|Ok Over rating hip hop these days is the norm,I mean kanye has some nice beats ,but damn the all got some whing in the back or some stupid catch,His lyrics P-diddy type no impressive, I only gave him 2 due to a 2 or 3 catchy tracks that its people.Quit jumping on the BANDWAGON JUST BECAUSE UR FRIEND IS LISTENIN TO IT.. Not a haters just a hip hop critic so holla back

B00002MZ4V|5.0|This collection of film scores is wonderful. All of William's best scores are on these CDs; Jaws, STAR WARS, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Superman, E.T., Jurassic Park, and all of the good ones. This is the kind of CD that you never get tired of.<BR>I recommend this collection to anyone and everyone who loves the movies, is interested in classical music, or are just looking for something different. This collection is a masterpeice composed of John Williams' best pieces and film scores.
0800177177|3.0|I love this movie but I refuse to buy the current dvd. Why? It contains NONE of the special features, which DO exist. If you really love this movie, I advise you to wait for the Criterion Collection to put out their version. Criterion put out an incredible edition of Bram Stoker's Dracula on Laser Disc back in the early ninties, and it included TONS of special features - commentary tracks, cast &amp; crew interviews, special effects featurettes, and scene comparisons to all the old black and white movies that inspired Coppola's visual approach. It was a really beautiful laser disc, loaded with REALLY in-depth extras. Since the dvd revolution began, the Criterion folks have been (very slowly, very gradually) re-releasing all of their classic laser disc editions on dvd, one by one. So if you are thinking about buying this product I advise you to hold out. It's only a matter of time before Criterion unleashes their version on dvd, and I can tell you (from having watched the laser disc many times) that it will be well worth the wait. You will get so much more for your money than this dvd, which yes, may look nice but really has nothing more to offer than the old widescreen video tape copy you probably already own.
B000002ITM|2.0|This album is way slower then anything in their previous work.  It comes off sounding un-inspired and dry.  Not quite as bad as the albums to follow, which are REAL garbage, but just not an enjoyable album.  Souls of Black and the three preceding albums are there best work and what they should be remembered by.  Don't buy this or anything made afterwards.  True, it is all a matter of opionion.  I see reviews on this site of this album saying it is their favorite Testament album.  And I've even seen negative reviews for Souls of Black.  But hey, this is the Steveman here, would I lie to you?  What would I gain in doing that?  I'm only trying to save you money and disappointment.  <BR>Not a good album.
B000063COX|5.0|This album makes me have a god-@#$% orgasm it's that good.  Its fast as hell and is a prototype for thrash/speed metal of the 80's.  Every song rules especially transylvania and Iron Maiden.  The musicianship on this album is outstanding.  Tell me that any current guitarists possess this kind of talent.  And if they do then why aren't they releasing albums this good?  Because the level of quality here is untouchable by all but the best.  Hey buddy,  I want you to buy this album.  If you don't like it I'LL give you your money back.  Buy it NOW!! you pukes!! Do it before I rip you head off and @#$% down your neck.  Trust me, you'll love this masterpiece.
0156027321|5.0|This is one of the most fun books ever.  Clever, interesting details about international culture, allegorical, an easy reading page-turner, who could ask for more.  I didn't want it to end!
B00008QSA5|4.0|My brother brought home a vinyl copy of 1968's `Super Session' sometime around 1969, and the presence of one performer caught my eye.  I was already overindulging myself on the debut Crosby, Stills and Nash album, and had taken special notice of Stephen Stills contributions, especially his exquisite guitar work.  After the first play through, I never heard the first 5 tracks of `Super Session' again... I played side two over and over until the needle had worn clean through side one!  Well, I'm kidding of course, but the point is that this 15 year-old was much too young for the cutting edge blues-rock being composed and performed by Al Kooper and Mike Bloomfield on side one, but primed and ready for the country and psychedelic rock being offered up by Stills and Kooper on side two.<br />Hearing this album (remastered) for the first time in about thirty years was a real treat.  I still prefer side two, but did a jaw drop over Bloomfield's stunning blues guitar solo's on the first five tracks, and on two of the bonus tracks (`Blues For Nothing' and `Fat Grey Cloud', the latter recorded live at the Fillmore West).  On the downside, Bloomfield was so strung out on heroin that Kooper couldn't keep him around for more than one night of  recording.  On the upside, certainly no artist can sing or play the blues better than someone living the blues, and this recording proves the blues was Bloomfield's lot in life.  Heroin claimed him for good in 1981.<br />With only half an album in tow, Kooper turned to Stills, orphaned from the recently disbanded Buffalo Springfield, to complete this most unusual endeavor.  Stylistically Stills and Bloomfield have radically different approaches.  On the opening cut of side two, Stills layers a country-fied guitar over Bob Dylans `It Takes a Lot To Laugh, It Takes a Train To Cry', and follows this with his trademark wah-pedal guitar on an 11-minute version of Donovan Lietch's `Season of the Witch'.  My favorite song on the album follows withStills and Kooper producing a psychedelic cover of `You Don't Love Me'.  Oddly, though Kooper is the only artist featured on all the cuts, the work is clearly owned primarily by Bloomfield, and secondarily by Stills.  Kooper's most notable contributions are songwriting (one solo, and three with Bloomfield), and all the vocals (5 cuts).  But the vocals are incidental, to say the least.<br />There are several odd selections on `Super Session'.  The third cut, `Man's Temptation' is a soul number penned by Curtis Mayfield.  It's a pleasant listen, though quite sexist by our standards today, and out of place among the heavy blues orientation of the other Bloomfield cuts.  Track four, `His Holy Modal Majesty' is a dreadful cut, with Kooper playing an electric piano called an ondioline, which comes across as electric bagpipes, and it's every bit as bad as that sounds.  At 9 minutes in length, it is a clear waste of vinyl.  The other odd number is the lush `Harvey's Tune', penned by Harvey Brooks who played bass on the `Super Session' sessions.  Brooks and Barry Goldberg, who plays electric piano on the first two tracks, had been bandmates of Bloomfield's in the band Electric Flag, which also featured drummer Buddy Miles.  The tune again sounds out of place, and Still's guitar is nowhere to be found.<br />The bonus tracks are valuable on this disc, to hear more of Bloomfield's playing, and to hear both Stills and Bloomfield's guitar work without the distraction of the brassy overdubs.  These artists have abundant skills that deserve to be displayed, not dressed up, or God forbid, hidden.  In the liner notes Kooper talks about his perception that the `naked' tracks were \\"dynamically impaired\\", hence the original decision to `enhance' them.  Despite his perception, this seems to me to be a clear case of less being more.<br />So while you may be hitting the `skip' button once or twice while taking in this CD, there is a great deal of unique and wonderful late-1960's music tobe had on this, the first and perhaps greatest `jam session'.
0767817478|1.0|This movis is awful to put it mildly!!It should not even be called godzilla. Let's take a look at him. He's an overgrown iguana made by a french h-bomb. I mean he was running wildly away from some little helicopters shooting bullets!This movie is a dissapointment to us G Fans!!
B00000JTB2|5.0|So many people have given this album rave reviews and a few others have said of what is flawed with the album, to some extent I agree with both of these folk. Both of these guitarists have great solo albums and both of them are probably worthy of being in the 100 best guitarists of all time lists. When both are put in a room together you would expect that they produce some of the greatest music ever recorded, I cannot say that they did. What they did produce however was some really thick and juicy guitar sounds, with Albert King's guitar usually playing the rythtm. This gives Stevie Ray Vaughn the chance to actually play with a rythym guitar instead of just by himself, and this makes his sound simply so much better. Little needs to be said about the greatness of Albert King except for the fact that I wish I was him (I really do). He has a perfect blues voice and amazing guitar abilities. The smalltalk is kind of inane though at times somewhat educational but tahat doesn't take away anything from this album.
6305949980|4.0|Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king, is the Halloween planner for Halloweentown and after another successfully Halloween that was scarier that ever he drifts off in melancholy.  Jack seems to have found himself in a brainy predicament as he tries to find reason in what he does and why he exists.  In contemplation Jack stumbles through a deep forest until he discovers an opening in the woods where there are a number of secret doors that lead to all the different holidays.  Jack decides to peek behind the door with the Christmas tree, but a strong wind pulls him in and he falls into a Christmas Town.  Flabbergasted Jack learns about this new and strange holiday as he is amazed about the peculiar traditions of Christmas Town and its leader, Santa Claus.  As Jack returns to Halloweentown he informs the citizens about Christmas Town and its scary leader, which leads him to want to give the people a Halloween styled Christmas, but there seems to be some dangers to this undertaking.<br />Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful story written by Tim Burton where misinterpretations and errors lead to admirable traits such as courage, forgiveness, and love.  However, the story is told in a macabre environment where characteristics are most often forgotten.  Despite the ghoulish atmosphere there is always a need for love and affection, and this punches through the true need for these traits.  Henry Selick does a very good job as he directs this puppet feature as it offers many thoughts and ideas for an audience to ponder, which leaves them with a very good cinematic experience.
B00006GJ9F|5.0|i think the other reviewer on here is mistaken:  Why isn't on the enhanced part on the american version....that's I Don't Give.  Why is a DIFFERENT song.  i think i read somewhere it was her first or something..anyways its a nice acoustic song. go check it out
B0000714BP|4.0|&quot;To Wong Foo&quot; seemed horribly miscast when you found out who was in it ... I mean, John Leguizamo had done drag before, proving himself to be very convincing and most definitely in touch with his &quot;feminine side&quot; -- but Wesley Snipes and Patrick Swayze??!  Two macho movie stars pulling off parts as drag queens on a road trip?<br />But then you saw the movie ...<br />The three men do excellent jobs, Wesley Snipes in particular a total surprise in his role as Noxeema Jackson, drag queen with Attitude.  Swayze, as Vida Boheme, is the &quot;lady&quot; of the trio who can get down and dirty when she has to -- and Leguziamo as Chi Chi Rodriguez is nothing short of perfection.<br />The plot is simple:  At New York's Drag Queen of the Year contest, Noxeema and Vida tie for the crown.  The title comes with a free airline ticket to Los Angeles, to compete in the Drag Queen of America competition, and the two &quot;girls&quot; couldn't be more excited.  But then they meet little Latin Chi Chi Rodriguez, whose drag queen self-esteem was not at all helped by losing this competition.  Vida, the kind of person who always believes in helping those less fortunate, talks a VERY disgruntled Noxeema into selling their plane tickets ... and using the money instead to buy a cheap car and drive to the L.A. contest.  The night of the win, Vida spots an autographed photo of Miss Julie Newmar on the wall of the reataurant they are dining in, and reads the inscription:  &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot;.  For those not in the know ... for years actress/model Julie Newmar, best known for her role at Catwoman on the tv series &quot;Batman,&quot; has had rumors floating around saying that she's a drag queen in real life -- not a woman.  She's just too statuesque, her face too strong on bone structure, to be a real woman!  When Vida sees the framed autographed photo on the wall, she takes this as a sign that the three of them will be blessed on theirquest.  She also takes the photograph.<br />Halfway 'cross country, in Nebraska, the threesome is stopped by a racist sheriff who notices their tail light is out.  Taking Vide back toward his car, he comes onto her, thinking she is a real woman.  When he reaches under her dress and learns the truth, Vida tries to break free ... and knocks the sheriff to the ground, where he conks his head.  They drive off quickly, before he can come to and REALLY do them all some damage.<br />Soon after, their old Cadillac breaks down, and Chi Chi hitchhikes them all a ride into Snydersville, a town that makes Mayberry look like New York City.  Tiny and hick and populated with small-town minds as well, Snydersville seems to be the LAST place three drag queens would want to get stranded (if they want to live, that is), but when these three are stalled there for the weekend, until they get their car repaired, they decide to make the best of it by making over the town's women, addding some spark to a Strawberry Social - and, in general, bringing tons of color to an otherwise drab existence.  But little do they know that Sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn) - who is less than thrilled by being knocked unconscious by a &quot;boy in a dress,&quot; is out to find them ...<br />The movie is uneven in spots - the scenes in the town go from hysterical to being too stage - but overall whenever Snipes or Swayze or Leguizamo are on-screen, you could never be bored.  Funny and with some VERY sharp one-liners, the movie comes close (especially in the end) to turning sappy with its &quot;why can't we all just get along&quot; mind-set -- but never quite pushes that envelope.  The three leads are EXCELLENT, and backed beautifully by a great supporting cast the includes Stockard Channig, Melinda Dillon, Chris Penn, Jason London - even &quot;Alias&quot; star Michael Vartan.  Ru Paul and Robin Williams add both class and style to brief cameos ... as does the one and only Miss Julie Newmar herself.<br />Stylishand funny and just corny enough to work, this comedy is anything but a drag ...
B000003C5C|5.0|This is my favorite death album.  It fits nicely in between Scream Bloody Gore and Spiritual Healing in that is has the raw, fast, rough musical sound from S.B.G. and a little more complexity in the music and lyrics like S.H. but not too much.  Every song rocks on this album.  The grinding tunes jam almost like a thrash/speed metal album from the mid 80's but its also way harder than that.  Chuck's voice is awesome on this album.  In later albums Chuck seemed to get really abstract and intellectual in his lyrics but this one, while still being a step up from S.B.G. which is a good thing, is not overly abstract or intellectual...I think the songs are perfect lyrically and musically.  My very favorite Death song is Forgotten Past.  Pull the Plug is another classic on this album as is the title track, the war song Left to Die, and of course the song named after the ad-libbed ending to Day of the Dead- Choke On It!!..Just compare this album to newer material from Cannibal Corpse, Diecide, etc.  You will find that the newer stuff is maybe a tad harder, but this is better quality death metal...In my opinion.  It feels cooler and jams out better.  For instance, I just bought the newest Diecide and I know theres no way in hell I'm gonna listen to that as much as I've listened to this album since owning it.  Leprosy just has an awesome feel to it.  In 1988 I was all of 8 years old.  I wish I could go back and buy this album back then just to show it to my friends and my parents and look at their reactions.  Buy this if you have any interest whatsoever in DEATH METAL.  I bet you it will become one of your very favorites.
B00009TB5G|2.0|There are shockingly senseless departures from Tolkien.
0743454529|5.0|I was pulled into this story immediately because 13 year old Anna was so alive and thoughtful.  I identified closely with her, but also with all the characters--Piccoult's switching between points of view helped flesh out the story and added a dimension that might have caused this story to degenerate into a good guy/bad guy tale.  Instead, I knew all of these people and my heart ached for them.  It's been a long, long time since a book made me cry...but this one did.  I can highly recommend this one as a thought-provoking and worthwhile read.
6304602944|5.0|Lots of action for gals (like me!), watchin Sly and Kurt's cute buns and hot bods running through this movie- also Terri Hatcher is great for the guys to see, she can act but not dance ha ha- lots of one-liner wisecracks and great second performances- Jack Palance as a hilarious chief villain, Geoffrey Lewis (who, incidentally, didn't get listed in the credits!)Clint Howard and more! As fine of a plot as one expects for an action flick, come on, its a MOVIE!! and a mighty FUN one, at that! Two L.A. cops, rivalling for headlines &amp; high total of drug busts, and the bad guys that try to take them out! Not to mention lots of zany characters along the way- WHY can't hollywood make a Clive Cussler Novel like this? Funny, witty, lots of action, just like its written! as the Aussie villain puts it, &quot;Balls to plan A!!&quot; as a &quot;B&quot; movie, this one gets MY vote!! Hope you have fun watching it!:)
0060005688|5.0|In The Paradox of Choice Barry Schwartz provides evidence that we are faced with too many choices on a daily basis. He also presents impressive facts of psychological evidence about how more looking actually makes us less happy with our final decisions. In the beginning of the book it talks about shopping at a grocery store and the number of options there. As the number of options increases, the psychological stakes rise accordingly. This book is helpful in many ways; it shows us how to reduce stress in decision-making. Faced with numerous options in today society Schwartz provided information on leaving your losses behind and focus on the future. He also touched on the topic of regretting, because it's hard to go through life regretting every decision you made because it might not have been the best possible decision. I recommend this book to anyone whose been faced with decision making. <br /> After reading The Paradox of Choice I realized the over-whelming amount of choices I came across within the next hour, and how I had a difficult time deciding on what to do. Even with the number options I had to choose from I couldn't pin point on just one. This book is a tool that everyone should use in coping with day-to-day decisions.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|Neal Morse. That name means so much in the world of prog-rock. The music this man has made over the last decade stands the test of time like no other. From The Great Nothing to Snow to Bridge Across Forever to The Light, Neal Morse stands head and shoulders above his contemporaries. Now we come to Testimony. This album has been reviewed to death. I will not bore you with the details of the greatness of the songs. It is, suffice it to say, the perfect blend of prog-rock and Christian spirituality. I think we are moving into a new genre of rock music. It began for Neal with certain songs on previous Spocks' CD's. (Goodbye To Yesterday, I Will Go, At The End Of The Day, etc...) It now hits you full frontal on this epic story of one (every) man's redemption. Let's step back and open our minds and not simply shrug this effort off as a &quot;religious&quot; CD. That is too easy for today's supposed rock critics. Tear him down through his faith. Let's be fair and listen with open minds and open hearts. Neal gloriously attributes his gifts to the creator. He lets God's spirit move through his lyrics and music - not getting in the way - that is true genius. The man that recognizes his own limitations is the smartest of men. The man that knows how little he really knows is a smart man. I think this fits Neal Morse. He saw his calling and surrendered to a higher purpose. The result is possibly the greatest rock epic ever written. Give this CD a chance - give Neal a chance - give Christ a chance. If you listen, as I said before, with open heart and mind, you will be rewarded. The beginning of the book of Revelations says that &quot;whoever reads these words will surely be blessed&quot;. Well, I say now that whoever listens to this musical masterpiece will be truly blessed.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|First of all, please read this entire review.  I do put quite a bit of effort into my reviews and I feel that they deserve your full attention.  I sense, sometimes, that readers merely &quot;skim&quot; even my reviews.<br />Anway, let's proceed:<br />Franz Ferdinand - This compact disc (C.D.) has been widely anticpated and, since its release, widely tauted as well.  I of course expected that it could not possibly meet the expectations of the &quot;hype.&quot;  I found a way to purchase it, however, and played it and, afterall, I find, that it truly does hail a new era of music.  Franz Ferdinand stands above the fray.  His voice can best be described as a combination of the very different voices of M. Casablancas of The Strokes and M. Banks of Interpol.  Sounds bizarre, but, if you buy this C.D., you'll see that such a thing can exist and does sound, frankly, exquisite.  <br />He also sings in a similar theme and tone to that of Joy Division (before they inexplicably dismissed Ian Curtis from the band to create New Order), but Franz (if I may refer to him with such familiarity) has found a greater depth and, I daresay, a higher ability for melody and the &quot;ache of life&quot; than Joy Division ever did.<br />Some also find a hint of Beatles influence in this C.D. (see above for what the acronym C.D. stands for).  I do sense that as well.  However, I think Franz succeeds where the Beatles obviously failed which is in capturing a true character for a song.  The Beatles created some decent melodies but were just never able to reach above a certain level in regards to true artistry.  Franz does and he completely decimates the Beatles with his superior facility for hooks and complexity.<br />If any of you are writing your own reviews and wish to refer the readers of your reviews to mine, please feel free to do so.  Please also look for a more in-depth review from me in about a week (I'm drafting it now).
B000024D4R|5.0|Why don't you own this CD, you useless excuse for a music fan? <br />The album is perfect. The sequence of Dogs, Pigs, and Sheep is better than any other trilogy in existance...dare I say it even rivals the critically acclaimed American Pie trilogy. Nay, it rivals even the lucrative Revenge of The Nerds series. Even possibly the Land Before Time saga. <br />But seriously, this album is the easily most underrated PF album. Waters' and Gilmour's voices are fantastic and Rick Wright's keyboard playing, especially on Pigs, is brilliant. <br />The guitar and keyboard riffs on Animals are hauntingly spectacular.<br />Buy this CD immediately. You disgust me for not already owning it.<br />Also, buy the rest of their albums. They are amazing.
0618526412|5.0|The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is one of the best novels I've read in a while.  I loved the way Carson McCullers develops the characters in this book. Loneliness and racial injustice are two timeless themes in this novel that McCullers presents so well.  McCullers was a white woman writing about how black people were mistreated and felt oppressed in 1940.  She was an author truly ahead of her time in that way.<br />All the characters are so memorable in this book.  Biff Brannon is a compassionate cafe owner.  He helps anyone in need by giving them either food, money or a job.  Brannon becomes a widower when his wife dies suddenly of a tumor.  Mick Kelly is a lonely but intelligent 12 year old girl from a poor family with a passion for music.  Doctor Copeland is a black physician.  He becomes a crusader for racial justice when his son goes to jail.  McCullers explains the basic principles of Karl Marx's economic theory in the novel by putting in a lecture by Copeland in the novel to show how society is divided between the rich and poor people.  I knew nothing about Karl Marx's ideas, so I thought this part of the novel was very interesting.  Another memorable character is John Singer.  He is a man who does not have the ability to speak. However, he becomes the person all the characters eventually confide all their problems to.  Singer communicates with his long time room mate and only deaf friend by using sign language.  The relationship and love between these two deaf friends is one of the best things about this novel.<br />The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is one of the best books Oprah has ever chosen for her book club.  The themes of loneliness and racial injustice are timeless and  universal.  The characters are very memorable too.  I loved reading this book.

B0000C7PSW|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, this is the most stunning, mesmerizing, scaringly beautiful music to have been released in many, many, many years. Comparisons aside, as I wouldn't be doing this exceptionally talented man justice if I tried to dig up influences (which I am tempted to do, but will restrain from doing).<BR>If this is self-indulgence, well, it couldn't have been put to better use. Why get angry at him because he knows he's one of a kind? Did you expect he wouldn't notice?<br />I Want Two, and many more!<br />Shine on, crazy diamond!
B0000039QA|5.0|This is one of the best Hip Hop album ever made in hip hop history. You don't know hip hop until you listen to this, Big was such a head of his time. Some Chrouses on this album were ok but Biggies lyrics saved it a lot. It is very sad that Big past away he would have been huge right now. Look at Jay-Z now and look at him at that time. Makes a lot of since doesn't it Big and Pac would have been huge. Lyrically Big is one of the best he has a story telling type style. That's why rappers say he was so good you just have to really listen to what he's saying. The best song to me would be..... I can't name it but a list would be Somebody Got to Die, Story to Tell, Kick in the Door, Going Back to Cail, Notorious thugs, and Your Nobody (Till somebody kills you) I'm not a fan of Big but I respect his music. R I P we still miss ya Big Guy.
B00009V7P8|2.0|Maybe I'm still punch-drunk of Rufus Wainwright's magnificently rich, multi-layered, overwrought, overproduced \\"Want One\\", but after giving \\"O\\" more than its fare share of listens, it hasn't really struck a chord with me. I tend to think he is a tad overrated. If it comes down to organic, stripped down, home-made records, I'd take Ron Sexmith, David Gray, or Jack Johnson anyday.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is the album, for the people that don't understand rap and say this is stupid. They have been smoking more than Snoop Dogg. This is a very good album. Snoop at his Best to me at least.
0440211727|4.0|The classic John Grisham novel, A Time to Kill, is a transfixing story of  the violent effects of racism in the deep south. Carl Lee Hailey is a southern, black man, whose daughter was beaten and raped by two racist hillbillies. He extracts his revenge through another act of brutality as he guns down the two rapists in front of hundreds of witnesses. In an attempt to free himself from a fate of prison or death,  attorney Jake Brigance brings forth his efforts to help the apparently doomed man.   <BR>     This was a very graphic and powerful story. Grisham focuses on the racial inequality to show how a black man in that situation would be treated. The events throughout the entire story, show the anger of the man whose family was shattered by ignorance. I believe that the best feature is the intense detail. Although at times a bit gruesome, the writing can truly make you feel engrossed in the story along with the characters.<BR>     There are plot twists concealed in the midst of what would appear to be a straight-forward story line, which prove to make things a great deal more interesting than merely providing a predictable set of events to thumb through. The book is severely hard to put down due to the <BR>     If there are any flaws they are well disguised. The only detail to be considered a flaw is that while Carl Lee murdered two men in his state of rage. Anyone with a family member forced to endure such an inhumane experience,  would probably feel this way as well. Though his feelings toward those men were comprehensible, did they bestow a right to take their lives? This is the primary focus of the story line; however, the fact that Carl Lee was black makes you wonder if he was white, would the murders have even been an issue. Overall, the story was good and the writing was amazing. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B00004T9UF|4.0|Eminem is a very good rapper the white media just over rates him to much. The best song on there is Stan but people act like that is the best song every made. But any way this album is good Eminem just got too fu**ing crazy on Kim and Kill you. My God Eminem.
0739307312|1.0|I read his other book &quot;Angels And Demons&quot; and thought it was okay so I thought I would check this one out.  The library didn't have the book in so I checked the tapes out.  The book probably would have held my interest more than the tapes did.  As it was, I don't know how many times I stopped the tape because it didn't hold my interest and because I would find myself thinking about something else.  It is natural for that to happen once in a while but it was continuous.  Then when I got to the part of Mary Magdelene supposedly carrying Jesus's child, etc., I almost gave up listening to it completely, but I had to remind myself that it was just fiction.  After that it did get a little more interesting (although I still had to stop the tape and rewind it because I missed something).  During the last part of the last tape I fell asleep and gave up.  The book just was not realistic or believable enough for me to enjoy.  I am not sure why it has been so popular.  If you are someone who enjoys farout whacko theories then you will probably enjoy it.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Bill Murray is a movie actor who has come to Tokyo to film whisky ads.  Scarlett Johansson plays the wife of a young photographer who is doing a shoot in Tokyo, but who is too busy to pay much attention to her.  They are both sleep-deprived and culture-shocked which seems like a good start to a relationship.  The movie pokes a lot of fun at the differences between American and Japanese cultures, from Bill Murray towering over the diminutive Japanese in an elevator, to a Japanese director who is trying to get Murray to look like Frank Sinatra of the &quot;lat pack&quot; (rat pack.)  Murray makes the most of these scenes and is hilarious as he gets carried away on an exercise machine and watches Japanese ladies prancing in a pool in a water aerobics class.  The movie is slow at the beginning and I kept wondering, &quot;What is the point to all of this&quot;, but eventually the developing friendship between Murray and Johannson is a joy to behold and it doesn't need much plot to sustain it.  Some of the characters seem unnecessarily shrill, such as the movie star friend of Johannson's husband and the manic talk-show host who interviews Murray, but perhaps these characters just serve as a contrast to the laid-back and somewhat melancholy main characters.  All in all, this is a good film and I look forward to more pictures from Sofia Coppola.
0553108034|5.0|To say &quot;the plot thickens&quot; doesn't do justice to this second volume of George R.R. Martin's massive fantasy epic.  Everything explodes around the characters we were introduced to in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, and the whole landscape of the Seven Kingdoms (the fantasy land this series is set in) is thrust into chaos.<br />Where &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; set the roots for the enormous and interwoven conflict that takes place in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, this volume takes that conflict and drives it through so many twists and turns that, by the end, you can't imagine how the protagonists of the story are going to make it through.  Every part of the plot is believable, as are the characters involved in them.  And almost every part excites.<br />Nevertheless, the flaws present in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; remain in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, albeit to a less exaggerated extent.  Martin shifts to a completely different viewpoint with each and every chapter, and the shifts are jarring enough that it often makes you want to put down the book and take a break.  And the pacing is, as before, slow.  This makes reading the book a impressive undertaking in its own right, though the well-written prose and dialogue and the usually self-enclosed chapters help to ease this difficulty.<br />And through all of this, the plot makes sense.  It isn't hard to keep track of where everything stands.  And in a work of this complexity, that shows remarkable skill on the part of the author.<br />The world of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; is compelling.  Its characters are compelling.  And even more so than in the first volume, &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; has driving, powerful plot.  It's a shame that this plot has to take place over six volumes of a thousand pages each, but it's well worth the reader's time and effort.  Fantasy readers owe it to themselves to give &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; a look.

B00009UW0N|2.0|cmon r u serious. greatest horror movie ever my ass. it was prolly good in 78 but it doesnt compare 2 some of the movies today. i meen all the reviews for scream said it was pathetic but it sure was a hell of a lot better than this. i thought it was scarier than this 2 and it wasnt that scary itself.
0743454529|3.0|&quot;My Sister's Keeper&quot; does raise questions in my mind, just like the it promises. They may not be the questions the author wanted you to ask. <br />Anna is a thirteen year old girl who has healthy but has to donate her body to Kate, her sister, who has a rare form of leukemia. Anna was conceived only to help her older sister survive. When she is pushed to far, Anna fights back for the right to make her own choices abour her body.  <br />Her brother, Jesse has also had enough with his parents choices.  He chooses to act out by setting fires, which ironically, his father (Brian) has to put out. <br />Their father, Brian, is pushed into a hard position.  He loves his children and his wife, but sometimes his wife seems only to care about one person in the family, Kate. When Anna decides to sue them, he moves out with her and the family unravels more.<br />Sara, who in my opinion was a selfish women who only cared about Kate, no matter the consequences to her other children, was supposed to be a moving character.  I thought she was unbearably horrible.  The true question of the book was who would ever allow a women like that to become a parent?<br />The &quot;twist&quot; int the end felt like the author's attempt to neatly rap up the book and show that Sara really did love Anna.  However it fell flat and I was left with a disappointed feeling.  The one you get when a book doesn't live up to your expectations.
B0002234LS|4.0|I personally think this movie is great! yeah, so its kinda weird, but if it wasn't wut would be the point. i liked how the whole movie keeps you guessing. the scene where he was talking to himself, that was totally creepy, and i loved it. but the one part i couldn't stand was at the end how his hair was, ick! he looked like a geek, but then again, its johnny depp, who i absolutely love! normally he's the hottest man EVER!
0066620996|5.0|I will be short and to the point to give you some new information. Jim Collins did a certifiably brilliant job with &quot;Good to Great&quot;. I have read it a number of times and often refer back to it and its reviews here on Amazon.com. In so doing, I did not feel above following the suggestion of a previous reviewer by reading a book for those who are truely interested in becoming first class leaders through understanding the core foundations of leadership. The book is called &quot;West Point: Thomas Jefferson: Character Leadership Education&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. Though not in any way in competition with &quot;Good to Great&quot;, which everyone should certainly read first, I highly recommend going on from there to read the Remick book. Like &quot;Good to Great&quot;, it was incredible, but in an altogether different way.
B00013EY7Q|2.0|This is a film that both my daughter and I were interested in seeing, given the acclaim that Bill Murray's performance had drawn. Moreover, the film itself had drawn critical acclaim. So, when my daughter was home from college one weekend, we decided to hunker down and watch it together. When we both fell asleep while watching it, we decided that we were just tired. So, we decided to give it another go around the next evening. Well, unlike love, it was not much better the second time around, though we managed to avoid falling asleep, yet again.<br />Quite frankly, if Sophia Coppola, the writer and director of this film, were not the daughter of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola, I am convinced that this film would have quickly vanished without a trace. In fact, I doubt that it would even have been made. When her acting career fizzled, after making her less than memorable acting debut in her father's film &quot;Godfather III&quot;, Sophia Coppola apparently turned her hand to directing and was let loose upon an unsuspecting public.<br />While this film has good production values, it simply meanders along in a loosey-goosey sort of way. If focuses upon two individuals, Americans who find themselves in Tokyo, alienated from their surroundings and, seemingly,  from life in general. One of these individuals is Bob Harris, a film actor on a career downslide, who now finds himself shilling whiskey in Japan for mega bucks, while his movie career is at an impasse. The other is a beautiful twenty-five year old woman, a Yale Graduate with a degree in philosophy, who is in Japan with her husband, a photographer who is working on a shooting assignment.<br />Bob Harris, played with wry bemusement by Bill Murray, is a man who is alienated from his family and, quite frankly, just plain lonely. His is a stark universe, as he seems to have a myopic view on life, seeing little beyond his luxury hotel's bar, where he like to go and drink. Charlotte, played with surprising maturity and flair by eighteen year old Scarlett Johansson, feels bereft and set adrift, as she struggles to keep herself occupied while her husband is ostensibly working. It is these two souls whose worlds collide, coloring their perspectives on life when an unlikely bond forms between them.<br />The film, which takes place in Tokyo, Japan, appears to mock the Japanese. Its stereotypic portrayal of the Japanese people, generally as buffoons, is reprehensible and a cheap joke. Sophia Coppola apparently thinks that the way Japanese people speak English is funny, as it  is a running, unfunny joke through out the film. Since the film takes place in Japan, perhaps it might have been funnier to see Bob (or Charlotte) attempt to speak Japanese, rather than turn Bob into the quintessential ugly American.<br />The film meanders along lacking a definitive narrative and any real profundity of thought. While there is definition about the characters' exterior selves, the film never delves into their inner selves in defining their present state of affairs. There are no big or traditional cinematic moments. Unfortunately, there are no small ones either, as there is really no  introspection by either of the two protagonists.  This is a film that viewers will either love or hate. I fall into the latter category. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;  is simply lost on me.y and flair by eighteen year old Scarlett Johansson, feels bereft and set adrift, as she struggles to keep herself occupied while her husband is ostensibly working.

1573229725|2.0|Sue Trinder lives in a family of petty crooks in the slums of Victorian London and Maud Lilly lives with her book-collecting uncle in a estate outside London. Through a villain named Richard Rivers aka &quot;The Gentleman&quot; they get involved with each other, because Rivers wants to get hold of the fortune of the rich girl the moment she becomes 18. The plot twists and turns, the girls fall in love but get separated but all is well that ends well.<br />A typical Victorian novel (or at least the interpretation of a modern writer of Victorian novels). To be honest: I could not care less what is happening to the main characters Sue and Maud. Their characters remained paper-thin (as were all the other characters in the book): they moan and groan but never pull themselves together and take life into their own hands. I know that Charles Dickens had to write sturdy books because he was paid by the word, but their is no reason why modern writers should also produce endless, boring descriptions and books with too many twists and turns that do not really add something crucial to the story that is being told.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|I am not one who usually writes online reviews, but after reading several that have trashed this movie for being something more that what it is, I feel compelled to defend this entertaining and funny work.  <BR>       I will be the first to admit that although there are several unrealistic, gaping plot holes and the dialogue is corny at times, anyone who looked for REALITY in this film is taking themselves too seriously.  The very nature of the story's premise would suggest to anyone who has an IQ above that of an amoeba that this film is FICTION.  I saw this film in 1996 in the theater, and have watched it several times at home on my 27 inch screen.  Regardless of the setting, it is still fun to watch because (take note you 2004 social activists)...IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY!  Yes, you too can enjoy the comedy, cheesy banter, and bombastic explosions this 2-hour film has to offer if you check your critical ego with the \\"power\\" button of your surround-sound home theater system.  Anyone who would even TRY to somehow draw a parallel between this film (which, I repeat, was made in 1996!) and events happening in the world in 2004 need to relax.  There was a reason why \\"Independence Day\\" broke box-office records when it came out, and it was because we were looking to be entertained for a few hours; we were NOT looking for a documentary on realistic intergalactic relations.  So although I would normally rate this movie with 3 or 4 stars, I am going to give it 5 because for the first time I now realize how entertaining (and totally unrealistic) this movie really is.  Wasn't that the purpose?
B0001D0FTW|5.0|It has been quite a time since I have heard such a great, perfect & distinctive album, one of those you listen after a 100 times and still say WOW!!!! Now the wait is over.  Hellfire Club is perfect, poised.  Edguy is metal's new Big Band, and Hellfire Club is Edguy's \\"The Number Of The Beast\\".  <br />Hellfire is very diverse (aggressive, melodic, ballads, long and short songs, etc.), still there is unity there, mostly in the lyrics.  You shift from one state of mind to another as the album goes.  Very soon you start humming the melodies and singing the lyrics. There are tons of feeling, the usual catchy choruses, efficient solos (no Malmsteenian masturbation, with all due respect).  But the guys added aggressiveness, some rawness. There is a sense of grandeur in every single element of this album (riffs, chorus, solos, cover, pictures, production, etc.).  I can even say that this album is Machiavelic manipulation, because the songs lead you to where they want you to be, mentally speaking, and then they blast you. This band is on FIRE, definitely!!!!<br />Talking a little about the songs since no other reviews did it so far. Mysteria is a great opener (very aggressive, trashy and typical Edguy chorus).  The Piper Never Dies is the song Dio and Blackmore should have done in the 70s (my favourite).  We Don't Need a Hero is the least strong, but a very good melodic metal.  Down To The Devil is the best melodic metal since the Keeper albums (from Helloween), but the chorus has some Van Halen in it (which is great). One of my faves.  King Of Fools is slightly different and better than the single version.  Forever is the best Edguy typical ballad ever.  Lavatory Love Machine is the perfect blend of Twisted Sister and Edguy (something like Twisted Guys), silly lyrics and perfect execution. I hope they play it live.  Morning Glory is the happier one and a great Cheer Up melodic metal.  Navigator is already a metal classic, with a great riff and one of Edguy's best ever choruses (that says a lot).  Monumental.  Finally, Spirit Will Remain is the symphonic ballad, the one to make you sad as you realize the tracklist is ending (but, if you are a true metal fan, I bet you will put this album back on track 1).

B0000CAQ27|3.0|I dont like this CD that much , because she looks and sounds like she is on drugs and she swears an incredible amount unlike her previous albums like the bonus track &quot;Hooker&quot;, &quot;you aint nothin' but a hooka.. sellin ya f**kin soul&quot; and her new track, i cannot remember &quot; why was i the last to know that bla bla bla you stupid f*ck!&quot; geez! lay down P!nk to me, she IS on drugs 92% of this album!! I luv &quot;God is A DJ&quot; (love it!)<br />The DVD is ok , 2stars i'd say. It has a vido anothe interview which she looks a bit high and a day in the life thing which she has no make up on in a shot. also it has pictures (yay!) the menu is awesome tho.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I liked Xtina's refreshing, unique, and powerful voice from her first album when she first came in the music scene as the squeaky clean innocent teen pop star, but i like her better as being the powerful, sultry, unique, creative, and in-your-face sexy pop star vixen whose not afraid to be real. Despite her music video from her first single \\"Stripped\\", which didn't leave too much for the imagination, and her obviously more raunchy transformation which \\"shocked\\" many fans and non-fans alike, this album shows that there's more to Xtina than what she comes out to be in the public eye, that there's something \\"beautiful\\", intriguing, and truly mature. <br />Stripped Pt. 1- Even though this isn't a song, i just like this introduction, it is a great way for us to see and hear the real Xtina in full scope. <br />Can't Hold Us Down- This song has a great beat, has a good message about the double standard and woman empowerment. 5.5/10 <br />Walk Away- Sounds sensual and sexy, very deep and sort of brings me chills. I think she controls her voice very well in this song. She doesn't sound too powerful, just enough for you to understand what she's saying, just beautiful.10/10 <br />Fighter- Definitely just a great, powerful, and moving song! I am glad this was a single. I never saw the whole music video, but i like that she showed a darker side of herself on it. 9/10<br />Infatuation- For some reason i wasn't feeling this song too much. I like the Latin feel to it though. 4.5/10<br />Loving Me For Me- I just love how Xtina voice shines in such a sultry, sexy, elegant way. This song sounds very innocent and beautiful. 7/10<br />Impossible- I love this song. I can tell my girl Alicia Keys was playing the piano at the intro, i can feel her energetic spirit along with Xtina's. Just a great, sexy, and R&Bish song. Sounds a little too similar to Alicia Key's new single though. 8.5/10<br />Underappreciated- This song is just okay. Nothing special. 5.5/10<br />Beautiful- She definitelymade a huge contribution for many young people and the gay community. She somewhat defined the fragile spirit of our youth today, and also of their strength from conquering their inner demons. The music video was not only affective and conducive, it was also just truly incredible and inspirational, makes you think and feel good about yourself. 10/10<br />Make Over- This song is fun and sassy. It sounds okay. 6/10<br />Cruz- This song sounds okay, once again her voice is soft, lovely, and refreshing. 8/10<br />Soar- Refreshing and inspirational. Not the best song on this album on my list, just okay. 7.5/10<br />Get Mine, Get Yours- Just OKAY. 5/10<br />Dirrty- This is what \\"stripped\\" off Xtina's innocent image and transformed a new icon, celebrity, artists, and more open definitive woman. I think her music video was a little overrated, sure it was a little in-your-face, but no harm done, it made us listen and still talk about it whether we liked it or not. I give Xtina props for this, this song made a statement that XTINA IS BACK. 10/10<br />A Voice Within- Sweet, inspirational, and pretty. I can listen to this song so many times and feel so moved and warmed by it. Another song that has meaning and a great message. 10/10<br />I'm Okay- This song is very nice, refreshing, raw, and just very well developed. She sounds very emotional from her pain, but somewhat empowering through the strength. 10/10<br />Singing My Song- A great finale! Showcases her strength as a woman and a person. 10/10<br />All in all, this album shows a maturity and a sense of class that goes beyond the likes of her \\"rival\\" Britney. I think it's unfortunate that the \\"Dirrty\\" music video overshadowed the album itself. This album shows great effort and maturity that many young pop artists like her don't even try to achieve. I wish this album wasn't underlooked just because of her \\"dirrty\\" image. But oh well, this is Xtina's best album, and i look foreward to the many others that are yet to come.
B00005JMSE|4.0|Created by Mike Mignola and based on the Dark Horse Comic of the same name, \\"Hellboy\\" is a cross between \\"The X Men\\" and \\"The X Files\\".<br />In the heat of World War II, an occult obsessed Hitler agrees to the opening of a space dimensional portal (with the help of Rasputin) that will literally unleash hell on earth. The Allied Forces intervene, however, closing the portal before any damage ensues. But, the portal does bring back a baby demon complete with yellow eyes, red skin, a pointy tale, and a curousity that leads the troops and a scientist of the occult (who becomes his stepfather) to befriend the little guy (with the help of \\"Baby Ruth\\" candy bars). Fast forward to the present and the demon, named \\"Hellboy\\", is a member of a team parapsycholigists that battles supernatural forces that threaten the world.<br />The film is quite good (for me it was easily likable, even though I didn't care too much for the comic). The cast is great. Ron Perlman was born to play \\"Hellboy\\" (Mignola modeled his title character after the actor when he was first creating the comic). Selma Blair is likable as the firestarter who has the hots for big red, while David Hyde-Pierce does his best Mr. Spock as the aquatic, Abe Sapien (a cross between Spock and The Creature from the Black Lagoon). The creature FX are some of the more impressive ones I've seen in awhile (the creatures \\"Hellboy\\" battles are a cross breed between a dog, a hawk, an octupus, with the teeth of a shark, and has tuna fish like eyes (6 of them).<br />Ranking the film, comic book wise, its better than \\"The Hulk\\" and is more in league with \\"The Punisher\\" and \\"Daredevil\\", than the \\"X-Men\\" & \\"Spider-Man\\" films. Not bad but, somehow, could be better.
B000002P5R|5.0|First let me say that this is definitely Jimi Hendrix's lost and unfinished masterpiece. Prior to his untimely death, he had been recording tracks for this album, that's the purpose of this compilation, to fulfill Jimi's visions for this masterpiece.<br />This magnificent starts out with &quot;Freedom&quot; a hooky guitar riff and fun chorus will make you come back for more listens. 10/10<br />Then is &quot;Izabella&quot; fun song for it's playful and catchy lyrics. Fun guitasr riff too. 10/10<br />Next is &quot;Night Bird Flying&quot; this song is so great and quite different from other songs, cool riffs, and one of my favorites from this album. 10/10<br />Next &quot;Angel&quot; is a matured ballad for Jimi, great melody and emotional. 10/10<br />&quot;Room Full of Mirrors&quot; is next, it's a great mix of blues, funk, and rock. Great Song, but it's succeeded by the next 2 tracks 9.5/10<br />&quot;Dolly Dagger&quot; is next an addictive guitar riff and fun lyrics never lets this song get old. 10/10<br />Next is &quot;Ezy Ryder&quot; a cool groove, fun lyrics, and an infectious guitar riff make this song my favorite on the album. And the chorus of lead guitars is nothing less than brilliant. 10/10<br />&quot;Drifting&quot; is the next song, and it doesn't have many lyrics but the ending instrumental part is very enjoyable. 9.5/10<br />Then is the song &quot;Beginnings&quot; aka &quot;Jam Back At The House&quot; is an excellent instrumental, one of my favorites, and the riffs are excellent as well, accompanied by a steady drumbeat. 10/10<br />&quot;My Friend&quot; is next, it's a mellow and enjoyable song with lyrics I can't get enough of. 10/10<br />Next is &quot;Stepping Stone&quot; there are some great solos played by Jimi on this track and pretty upbeat tempo as well. Great song to listen to. 10/10<br />&quot;Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)&quot; is next, this is another standout on the album for its straightforward, but entertaining riffs and simple, but appealing lyrics. 10/10<br />Next song is &quot;Earth Blues&quot; an entertaining song about making changes and rebirth. Very dynamic in its deliverance. 10/10<br />&quot;Astro Man&quot; is the funnest song on this album with its good-humored and amusing riffs and lyrics. One of my favorites from the album. 10/10<br />Next is &quot;In From The Storm&quot; this is one of Jimi's best and another one of my favorites from the album with its great lyrics and cathcy guitar riff make this a great song. 10/10<br />Lastly, is &quot;Belly Button Window&quot; its back to the blues for Jimi and is just a great song. It's another standout for me and definitely a cool song. 10/10<br />\\"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\\" is almost like Jimi Hendrix's career. It starts out with a bang, it's electrifying and enjoyable throughout the entire length, and you never want it to end, but suddenly it abruptly stops, and leaves you wanting to hear more. All good things must come to an end.<br />Although this album was never officially completed by Hendrix's standards, it's probably my favorite album of him in the studio. If this album was released with the songs being completed, I could only imagined how much he could have perfected these recordings, but it would have been his ultimate crowning achievement. This album is flawless without a bad track and is enjoyable, fun, emotional, and exciting from start to finish. It's definitely worth more than the 15 dollars I paid for it.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|I don't know who this director thinks he is. He goes through this movie with an air of superiority that completely destroys any credibility with his subject matter. By the end I truly got a sense that he thought he was better than these characters. All these little people that hold on to thier pithy dreams and end up addicted to some kind of drug. By the end, things go to a ridiculous extreme for all four cast members. It's a work of schadenfreude and it needs to be called out.
0316779237|3.0|By now just about everyone has heard that this is THE book to read during the Holidays as well as being the perfect little 'stocking stuffer' gift.  In some regards this may be the case - especially with the brilliant first short story in this tiny tome, 'The Santa Land Diaries,' a hilarious memoir of Sedaris' experience working as a seasonal elf at Macy's.  Unfortunately the remaining five stories fail to sustain the high level of excellence delivered early on making the remaining 2/3's of the book somewhat of a disappointment.<br />If you are a fan of Sedaris or curious about all the hoopla surrounding his style of humor then this book is certainly worth your while, especially with its brilliant opening and the fact that it shouldn't take you more then an hour to read from cover to cover.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This album is awesome. Just go buy it now, or read this review:<br />1. Welcome - Well...kind of stupid. This is how John Mayer started out. No use to rate this track.<BR>2. Have You Ever - Cool song. A song that is more punk than pop. I'm not saying that Offspring is pop, they do pop songs sometimes. I'm rambling. This is a cool song. 5/5<BR>3. Staring At The Sun - Pretty cool. Not the best though. 4/5<BR>4. Pretty Fly (For A White Guy) - I don't know anybody who hasn't heard this song. Gets boring after a while, but still a good song. 5/5<BR>5. The Kids Aren't Alright - Best. Offspring. Song. Ever. Period. 100/5<BR>6. Feelings - Good song. Once again, not the best. 4/5<BR>7. She's Got Issues - Reminds me of sometime I had when I found out my girlfriend had issues. Good song. 5/5<BR>8. Walla Walla - Really good song. I don't understand this: &quot;Hey Walla, I'll see you on the Walla Walla.&quot; Strange line. 5/5<BR>9. The End of the Line - Cool song. Nice to bang your head to. 5/5<BR>10. No Brakes - Really cool song. Another song that proves The Offspring can be punk. Punk, not rock. 5/5<BR>11. Why Don't You Get A Job? - &quot;My friend's got a girlfriend and he hates that b****&quot; - The opening line. This is a pop and punk (pop-punk, duh) song, pop - the melody, punk - the lyrics. 5/5<BR>12. Americana - I'm suprised this didn't get a parental advisory cuz of this song. Really good song though. 5/5<BR>13. Pay The Man - Everybody says this song sucks. I don't. 4:00 of crap though in the beginning, but good. 5/5<BR>BONUS TRACK: Pretty Fly (Reprise) - Mexican version of Pretty Fly at the end of Pay The Man. Just keep on listening. John Mayer also sings in this one. 4.5/5<br />So go get this CD. You won't regret it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have to admit I bought this c.d. as a joke between a friend and I. But I actually listen to the c.d. so I guess it wasn't a bad thing. <BR>1. Me Against the Music- It's really up beat and fun to dance to. It's a pretty good song. 95/100<BR>2. (I Got That) Boom Boom- I love this song it's really awesome. 99/100<BR>3. Showdown- I just can't stand this song. This is definitely my least favorite song on the whole c.d. I really can't bear listening to it. The first time I listened to the c.d. I was afraid the whole c.d. was going to sound like this song. 50/100<BR>4. Breathe On Me- This is okay but it's not one of my favorites 90/100<BR>5. Early Morning- Not really that great. 85/100<BR>6. Toxic- I love this song. I really like the string instruments in the background. 99/100<BR>7. Outrageous- I like this song alot. It's pretty cool. 98/100<BR>8. Touch of My Hand- It's a soft sweet song. Okay. 90/100<BR>9. The Hook Up- My favorite favorite song! This is the best song on the entire c.d. 100/100<BR>10. Shadow- I love this song too. It's cool it's a little bit more like a song from her second album (I don't own it but someone I know does) 99/100<BR>11. Barve New Girl- Most of this song is good. The only part that annoys me is how her voice turns in to this sound that- well it's weird. Most of it's cool though. 97/100<BR>12. Everytime- I really do like this song. I can't remember if she released this as a single or not. It's a good slow song that's calming to listen to. 98/100 <BR>Overall it's a pretty good c.d. and most people (not everyone) will like this c.d. <BR>Average Grade: 92 (Showdown brought down the average) It really is a good c.d. though.
B00006690G|4.0|the eminem show lp is blazin!!!! tho i don't thank it compares to marshall mathers lp in terms of delivery and catchy phases and punch lines ,but  with out a doubt marshall mathers shines on the over all preception what kind of person marshall mathers really is. for the most part its a all around good cd expect for songs like &quot;soldier&quot; i really wazn't feelin the whole concept of the song, in my eyes eminem is far from a soldier haha ,and &quot;saying goodbye to hollywood&quot; isn't any better in fact its my least favorite song on the album, its seems as if he wants us to feel he's pain of being a multimillion dollar rap artist behind all the glitz and glamour on how much of a hassle it all is, well boo f**kin whooo im typin this review at work and  would gladly switch professions.but aside from all that this latest installment is a yet another rap classic and eminems best work thus far,it would of got 5 stars if it wazn't for those 2 i just mention hopefully his next lp marshall mathers will let slim shady loose on alot more of the tracks.So all in all its  if you don't own the cd go out and get you a copy you won't be disappointed.
B000002J03|5.0|I admit that this is my favorite Led Zeppelin album.  Each song, with the exception of &quot;Bring it on Home,&quot; is memorable.  I could comment on each and every song, but I'm sure that there a hundreds of reviews that have already done that.  It's better to keep this short and sweet.  This is a really fine album.  Led Zeppelin practically invented riff-heavy rock.  These songs have layers, something that a lot of current music is missing.  Each musician knows their instrument inside and out.  Robert Plant's voice matches Page's playing perfectly.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album.
B00000K3UU|3.0|I first saw this movie on TV edited for a general audience.  I guess the whole family and I were enjoying it so much we didn't notice all the Bleeps.  When Sandler loses the kid, all three of my younger children were sobing.  We laughed, we cried, we cheered when the good guys won the day.  But...<br />Then I bought the movie.  This is not a family friendly movie becuase the language is to salty.  Sandler, who hardly ever got very much face time on Saturday night Live, except in the credits has turned out to be one of my favorites.  I like almost everything he does.   Big daddy is a 4 star, very good movie, but i have to give it 3 stars for the cursing.
B0000026NC|5.0|I just scrolled through the past reviews on this CD, and I was surprised to find so many negative (as well as positive) reviews. This has long been one of my all time favorite live rock albums. I feel compelled to come to its defense.<br />The essential thing to realize about this CD is that, at this point in time, Pink Floyd had become David Gilmour's band. He performs all the major vocals and guitar solos. Gilmour's voice is admittedly thin and average. But the reason I love this album is that I love Gilmour's guitar playing. His playing has a uniquely moody, theatrical quality. His solos on &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot;, &quot;On the Turning Away&quot;, and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; are filled with an emotional pathos few rock guitarists even strive to achieve. Whether you like this album or not boils down to whether you are temperamentally attuned to Gilmour's somewhat downbeat emotionalism. If you like intensely moody rock guitar work, you will definitely love this CD.<br />By loving this album, I mean no disrespect to Roger Waters, the erstwhile leader of this band who had a falling out prior to these performances. I have mixed feelings on whether this band has the right to claim the Pink Floyd franchise without Waters. Regardless, this CD has some of the most powerfully brooding songs and live rock guitar performances I have ever heard. I continue to enjoy listening to it, as well as playing along with David Gilmour on my electric guitar.
0061015725|4.0|'Prey' has all the hallmarks of a Michael Crichton science fiction novel: thrilling suspense wrapped in a story that stretches the imagination to the breaking point.  It has the feeling of a good film screenplay rather than a novel, but to be fair Crichton is a good writer.  Both his prose and characterizations are fine.<br />'Prey' takes us into the near future when nanotechnolgy (building microscopic computers) and biotechnology converge to a nasty effect.  Silicon Valley scientists fail to understand the true menace they've unleashed and it is up to the spouse of one of the dirty players to save the world.  Crichton spends a fair amount of time trying to explain how all this horror is plausible.  I didn't buy it but at least it's not preposterous.  And the suspensful storytelling had me going.  Great fun!<br />Bottom line: shamelessly enjoyable piece of science fiction fluff.  Recommended.
B00005JMSE|4.0|Entering this movie I was expecting a science fiction CGI monster movie devoid of anything meaningful to say. The trailers seemed to project that kind of movie. I was completely wrong.<br />The great thing about Hellboy is that the story is centered around the lead character's longing to fit in and the relationships he has formed with those around him. I loved how Hellboy was a complete character, with flaws and and bad habits as well as the good traits. The supporting cast are all complete characters as well, which makes this film stand apart.<br />This is not to say that Hellboy doesn't have its fair share of action and CGI monsters, but they are used within the context of the story and for the most part don't dominate the screen like in recent Sci-FI films (i.e. the Matrix Sequels).<br />I would say this film is a darker version of the X-men movies and deals with some of the same issues. Is Hellboy for everyone? Probably not. If you are not into monster movies, it is probably not for you. I, however, enjoyed it a lot. Hellboy is a lot of fun and I'll look forward to seeing it again when it arrives on DVD.
B000002UDB|4.0|I have so many Beatles' albums.  I don't think there's one album that I have that I don't like.  I love this album, my favorite tracks are, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;, &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot;, &quot;I am the Walrus&quot;, &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; &amp; &quot;All You Need is Love&quot;.  For some reason I can't get into &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, I really don't like that song all that much, I'll listen to it for a minute then switch it to another track.  A lot of people like that song, but I don't care for it too much.  Overall, this is a great album, the movie was awful, but this is wonderful, you'll enjoy it.
0783231032|5.0|I love this film!!! This is Spielberg's wildest, most frantic film. The jokes are hilarious, the action is aplenty and the sets are huge. A great film that never received the attention it so deserved.
B00008EY9G|5.0|This movie requires our brain to be fully alert as it is NOT of those slasher flicks like &quot;Friday 13&quot; or &quot;Freddy&quot; where even a drunkard can enjoy without actually thinking.<BR>The director has done a terrific job especially in the way he introduces the characters which gives us a hint about Schizophrenia on the prowl.He,the director,does not seem to attach much importance to the elements of gore,blood and suspense in the way the victims are being killed.All the killings are done by a schizophrenic individual and the killings are like to an outside individual, as if they are performed under the depths of sea..Am i confusing ?.<BR>Anyway this movie is a treat to those who want to see a good movie not neccassarily a horror movie..
B000007T2Z|5.0|Godspeed you! black emperor...<br />never before have i listened to an album and automatically had an out of body experience with no drugs involved. Gsybe may very well be the best group of working musicians in recent history. From the first note to the last note this album is absolelutlely amazing.<br />Listening to this album in my room with my eyes closed made me see everything all in one second. I was traveling down a highway in a car at an amzing speed, i was seeing buildings being demolished, cars exploding, people crying for help and there was nothing i could do, i opened my eyes and knew that i was in my room and everything was okay....godspeed you! black emperor is the best drug on the market...pick it up now!
B000089CJI|5.0|If you listen to &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; and it doesn't make you smile, you have no soul.  That song is the aural equivalant of bunnies, or the movie Amelie.  It's instant good mood.  I'm really diggin' this album.  By saying such things, I'm not implying by any stretch of the imagination that this is a sickeningly sweet album.  It's the perfect balance of pure, sweet, innocent happiness and sad, elegant beauty.  I would describe it as Depeche Mode meets Go Sailor meets The Smiths with a pinch of Neutral Milk Hotel...and also...hmm...a little Bjrk or Mm, maybe.  Bottom line, it's great.  Really great.  Sincerely.  This is the true definition of a gem.  To miss out on it would be a tragedy.
B0000YEEG2|5.0|Last year in Japan a monumental event took place. Over the course of one year the thirteen part series Space Pirate Captain Herlock: Endless Oddessy/Outside Legend was released on DVD. The DVD's were released once a month on the 21st of every month in 2002-2003. Now the series has come to America. And it has been well worth the wait.<br />The Space Pirates have been rounded up. All except for one. The legendary Captain Herlock (prononced &quot;Harlock&quot;). He is currently in exile on the Planet Of Rubble. When his friend Professor Daiba is killed by the entitys known only as the &quot;Nu&quot;, Herlock once again sets sail on the Sea Of Stars to get to the bottom of these mysterious beings appearance.<br />Directed by Taro Rin, this DVD collection surpasses Harlock Saga released two years ago by Central Park Media. The first volume contains the series initial four episodes. The animation is superb. It still retains the classic Matsumoto look while being very modern. The CGI animation has been refined dramactically and now looks better integrated into the classic 2D animation. No more of the plastic looking ships like in Harlock Saga. The one complaint I have is that sometimes the transfer looks a tad on the grainy side, but that has only been in a few places. The sound on this DVD is also excellent. Both language tracks are presented in 5.1 Stereo Surround Sound. The default language setting is English with translated Signs. This sounds like it would be obtrusive but Pioneer/Geneon has made sure that the subtitled signs would not be placed so as to be a hinderance. The quality of the English voice acting is also top notch. Herlock has always been a very powerful character and his English voice conveys that very well. When he speaks, you listen.<br />The Extras on this disc are a little sparse. There's a character gallery, Japanese Intro, trailers, and that's about it. Hopefully future volumes will include more.<br />There are not enough words to describe what a fantastic series this is. For Matsumoto fans this is a must have. For anime fans this DVD will make an excellent addition to your library that you can proudly display.<br />Yes indeed. He has returned........fantastic series this is. For Matsumoto fans this is a must have. For anime fans this DVD will make an excellent addition to your library that you can proudly display. <br />Yes indeed. He has returned........
B00006EXL5|5.0|Ok, this CD is soooo awesome. I had a really hard time finding it in the stores, but when I did, I was like so happy. The second I started listening to it, I knew I would love it. The guitars are awesome, drums are fab, bass is right on- vocals, well that is obvious, LOVE his voice! I just love this CD so much, you should get it if your into emo/hardcore/punk. Can't wait for their new CD coming in June!
B00006AULI|5.0|I had never heard of &quot;Session 9&quot; until a couple of weeks ago. Ever since I saw it, I can talk of nothing else. It's absolutely AMAZING, and it's sad that it's so overlooked. &quot;Session 9&quot; is like no other horror movie I've ever seen and leaves the viewer absolutely dumbfounded. If nothing else, it'll make you more afraid of the dark than you ever were before.<br />It's nearly impossible to summarize the plot without giving away the entire film, but I'll do my best. The setup: a crew is preparing an abandoned mental hospital for construction. Gordon, the leader of the crew, has held his position for a long time, and thinks that the stress is beginning to get to him. Then the strange things start to happen. One member of the crew discovers a room filled with psycologist's session tapes of the various patients. He starts listening to the sessions of a schizophrenic girl named Mary, who has three personalities: The Princess, Billy, and the eluisve Simon, who we don't hear from until the very end of the film. Another crew member goes missing, and Phil, Gordon's second in command, starts becoming wary of his superior's behavior, and maybe even gets a little power-hungry when he realizes that Gordon might not last too much longer. After a strange discovery, things begin to spiral out of control, leading to a completely unexpected ending.<br />&quot;Session 9&quot; is one of the most unpredictable horror films I've ever seen, which is a rarity in today's films like &quot;Gothika&quot; and &quot;The Ring&quot; which, while artsy, most people had figured out a quarter of the way into the movie. Everything is shot very cleanly and artfully and never sacrifices explanations for aesthetics. The soundtrack is very minimal, just a few well-placed &quot;pings&quot; of piano keys, as well as the occasional weird sound effect.<br />Every horror buff should see this movie. It's one of those rare beauties that sparks lengthy and entertaining discussions afterwards. Oh, one more word of warning: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE BY YOURSELF. Doing so would make it terrifying beyond belief. Enjoy.
B000000WFF|5.0|Hell, I already praised a Britney album, so this next step is only natural.<br />Besides, who can deny that the once fearsome-fivesome (quintet?) are probably the most undoubtedly fun group ever to come roaring out of the 90's?<br />...Anyone?<br />Okay, then. But back on track - pure sugary confectionary pop perfection all for us. Woohoo! Fast-paced furious latin-vibing Spice Up Your Life (built around a dancey piano line and godknows what else), the calming, watery, crammed-to-bursting-with-pretty-strings Motown vibes of Too Much (The Supreme Spices? Hmm...), the slinky sexy TLC-esque 90's R&B of Denying, the chilling Latin-tinged (there's that phrase again) ballad Viva Forever...<br />And the rest of the good stuff: The loud, energetic Pepsi anthem Move Over, the jazzy loungey ender built around a swingin' bunch-o-brass (The Lady Is A Vamp), and my personal favorite:<br />Stop. Frighteningly perky and sunny. And brassy - horns out the wazoo. Cheesy claptrack, check. Beeps, check. But good lord I love it. Anyone up for being in a good mood?<br />Then enter Spice World, and please check to make sure you are not allergic to any of the following:<br />Ginger<BR>Posh people<BR>Sporty people<BR>Scary people<BR>Babies<br />Enjoy.
B000089RVX|5.0|This band is like a cold blast of winter wind; not kind, not gentle, but clean and fresh, a little bleak, but like a clear winter day in the desert, a pore-clearing, soul wakening experience. Amy Lee's sometimes desparing lyrics and brutal honesty are fresh air after sitting for years in mainstream's in-bred, auditorium, with stuffy, smoky and stale sameness.<br />'My Last Breath' goes past surface angst to scream out the truth that Lee is warmly intimate to the listener who likewise craves to break through to authentic passion; 'My Immortal' does the same thing, but with a persistence that won't let your subconscious escape the repeating musical theme. You cannot do this song without tears, but the cleansing is worth it.<BR>  <BR>The critics looking for a more brutal experience miss Fallen's genuineness. If the ultra-hard-core want more of a baseball bat-to-the-head experience, they have their pick of headbangers, but then how shallow are you willing to be? For the growing ranks of maturing station zappers bored with mainstream music industry fast-food, Lee &amp; Company floors it with style and depth that blows past Linkin Park like they were still in 'park'.<br />Let the crybabies crawl away from what they don't understand, while the rest of us enjoy Evanescense's anti-405 two-lane as it twists dramatically through craggy, dark and stark granite spires. Sure the road isn't safe and predictable, but it's living for real. 'Fallen' is for those who aren't afraid to find out who they really are.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Take a lovable rogue of a captain, armed with a plutonium powered sarcasm blaster. Add to his band of merry men, a little Jayne perhaps and no nonsense Zo, Soften up with a sensual business woman, a pearl of a mechanic and an agreeable pilot. If stealing from the rich isn't enough to get the sheriff's attention be sure to get your hands on exactly what he's looking for. Serenity by name not by nature!<BR> I enjoyed the Buffy humor but firefly takes the wit up a notch. The mesh of characters is perfect. Everyone who's seen it has great things to say, problem is it was just as badly advertised in the UK as across the Atlantic. Great quality and I think my Dad's proof enough that you don't need to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy the banter.
0679879269|5.0|Note: When I was 13 my english teacher wanted us to use the internet, ooh shiny! So she made us put our book reports on amazon.com (this is why I was required to put references to pages and other stuff like that). I figured there's no point in deleting it. Just don't read it if you don't want to find out too much about the plot...and remember...it's a book report!<br /><br />The Amber Spyglass by Philip Pullman is another great book. It continues the story of Lyra and Will that is told in The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife. At the end of the second book, The Subtle Knife, Will finally finds his father after a long search, only to see a witch kill him before will's very eyes. After the witch kills herself, two angels appear to tell Will that he must come with them to Lord Asriel, Lyra's father, who is leading the rebellion against The Authority. Will comes to get Lyra, and finds her gone.  At the beginning of the book, we have no idea what is going to happen, but the ending surprises you.<br /><br />  The beginning of The Amber Spyglass is set in the beautiful Himalaya valley with a small village near a cave where Mrs. Coulter, Lyra's mother, is hiding her. Pullman elaborates the setting very well. \\"In a valley shaded with rhododendrons, close to the snow line, where a stream milky with meltwater splashed and where doves and linnets flew among the immense pines, lay a cave, half-hidden by the crag above and the stiff heavy leaves that clustered below\\" (Pullman 1). It is one of those books that you don't want to stop reading.  He  [Pullman] has created many completely different worlds, and an interesting way to travel between them. Some parts are completely unbelievable. Pullman even creates non-humans that have understanding the way we do. \\" Atal said, Yes. All the mulefa have this. You have, too. That is why we knew you were like us and not like the grazers, who don't have it\\" (Pullman 222).<br /><br /> When I first got this book, it was because of its two preqels. It must have been close to two years ago, when my mom was looking on amazon.com reviews for a good book for me. She told me about the good reviews for this book and the prequels, and ordered The Golden Compass for me. It sat on my bookshelf for a while, but when I was looking for a good read I decided to pick it up. I read the first chapter, and at first it seemed bland and uninteresting. I sat for a while and remembered that something similar happened when I first read another book. Near when the first Harry Potter book came out, my uncle bought me one for my birthday. This sat on the shelf a long time too, because after reading the first chapter, which took me forever, I decided that I never wanted to read it. When the fourth book came out, there was an article in Newsweek that had an excerpt from the first chapter of the fourth book, which my mom convinced me to read. After reading it, I wanted the book right away, so I ran upstairs to read the copy I had. Remembering this, I decided that I probably would like The Golden Compass once I read it, and that I didn't want to miss out on a good book like I had almost done before. I ended up loving it. It read unlike anything I had read before, rivaling some of my favorite authors. The ending was so pulling that I had to get the other two.<br /><br /> The Amber Spyglass is an overly superb book. It has all the qualities of a good book, including good characters, a good plot, a good author, and a good setting. It makes for a good read, since it is over 500 pages long. The climax of the book was very surprising, but it has a great ending. I would highly recommend it.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Wow!  Great melodies, great tunes, great music...all in one.  I haven't felt amazed like this in a while.  Gavin, you've musically lifted me.  This CD is a must buy for anyone.  It's THAT great.  The only thing better is seeing him live.
B00005JLEU|5.0|When this movie was released, in a perfect world, the entire board of directors of the Disney corporation should have sunk on their knees and committed seppuku. This is what innovation looks like, and, in spite (or because of) of its unrelenting weirdness, it's the sort of thing kids can really enjoy - I think, although not being a kid anymore myself, I can't be sure.<br />Spirited Away is a classic fable, mixing the conventions of European and Russian fairy tales with elements of Japanese folklore and contemporary culture. A young girl, Chihiro, somewhat bored and spoiled to begin with, loses her parents to a curse and is trapped in a world of gods and spirits, and undergoes a self-transformative journey which is rarely trite or dully moralizing. What sets it above many similiar animated fables is the sense of danger that is generated - things in this world are so drastic and bizzare that you actually find yourself wondering if the expected happy ending will result.<br />The grotesquery in the film is extreme, and I guess parents should be warned about it; the most striking things include a spirit which devours people (not fatally) and later vomits copiously, a scene in which the male lead in dragon form is badly wounded and bleeds from the mouth, and a scene that actually distrubed me in which a giant baby threatens to break Chihiro's arm. That giant baby is just plain creepy. I don't think kids, who are often more bloodthirsty than they are given credit for, would object to any of this; parents might be more effected.<br />The message - touching on the standard themes of true love and courage - is more convincing than usual, possibly because so much of what Chihiro accomplishes really does result from her own courage, and is not handed to her on a silver platter by a fairy godmother. A minor scene where she sprints down the length of a rickety bridge is especially effective. The romance, also, is not the overly sanitized kind you usually find in fairy tales; themale lead, Hako, has a dark side, and seems like an actual being rather than an impossible abstract.<br />Even those Americans who are hip enough to call Japanese animation 'anime' probably have a somewhat limited view of it. Most of these people (and I hope I don't offend anyone with this generalization) are male, between fourteen and thirty years of age, and addicted to stylized sex and violence (this is me). The anime which has been released in this country is generally targeted at them, and many of them seem to assume because of this that all anime is of that type. While I can't overstate by admiration for series like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Spirited Away is proof that the minds of contemporary Japan are capable of very different things. The most striking difference between this and other modern anime is in the character design - Chihiro is not particularly attractive. Hako tends more toward the classic bishounen, but many of the other characters are completley grotesque. This has always been Miyazaki's style, and makes the story much easier to believe.<br />The only way in which I believe I could have enjoyed this film more is if I had been fifteen years or so younger when I saw it. It's the quintessential family film, and far from being a Japanese oddity, deserves to be the staple of a new generation of American youth.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This is probably one of the best westerns ever. Top actors, top story and top music and of course the lovely Claudia. If you, like me, are a fan of westerns, you cant go wrong with this one. Along with The good the bad and the ugly and the other 2 of Sergio's westerns, this is an eternal classic of the Italian cinema.
B00005NTJK|1.0|&gt; but with today's technology, it should have been stunning.<br />The people who say things like this are simply brainwashed. In the first place, today's recording technology is not all that remarkable, and no reason it automatically should be. In the second place, recording is an art, not a science. The old vinyl disc version of Miles Davis's &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; sounds better than either of the laser disc versions for the simple obvious reason that the recording engineers who made the vinyl version were better artists than the recording engineers who adapted it for the new medium.<br />The problem with this record goes beyond this record: the entire Jethro Tull catalog is being routinely mucked over whether it needs improvement or whether it does not. There is no taste, no discernment, no artistic motivation behind this project. The intention is strictly a commercial one: to create more product. It works to the extent there is an audience of zombies indoctrinated with a irrational blind faith in mindless automatic &quot;progress&quot;.

Band of Brothers taught me many things, and by the end i felt as though i was involved in this brotherhood they had formed.

0618526412|5.0|I'm so happy that Oprah has picked this wonderful book for the book club.  I've read and reread it several times over the years and will continue to do so, and I'm glad it will be back in  circulation.  Carson McCuller's had a tragic life and this book is a small glimpse into her soul.<BR>Anyone interested in this book should read one of the biographies on her-she was a fascinating person.
B00000AFGM|5.0|From the shimmering notes that lead into the beautiful melody of great big white world, to the soaring, almost-comfortably-numb level chorus in Coma White.  The imagry of the pale dead earth, desolate because of our social segregation.  It is mechanical, it is human, and in many cases it rocks manson style.  Its really too bad people get hung up on his image and don't see the true potency of his social critque.  They only see him as the genderless-satan-man or whatever.  Not that I don't appreciate the image he has successfully cultivated.
0679420401|5.0|The author grew up in the area used as the novel's setting, and was from one of the well-off families.  He tended to be unpopular among his peer group because he became a champion of the poor working class.  This novel is about migrant farm workers, in particular one family who are refugees from the Dust Bowl.<br />The novel details the family's stuggle to survive under difficult conditions.  High unemployment provides a surplus of labor which farm and orchard owners can exploit, paying them as little as possible, and gouging them further with high prices at the \\"company stores.\\"  Attempts by workers to advance themselves were held down.  The law is on the side of the landowners.  It was an era when workers were easy to replace so little thought was given to their safety and welfare.<br />This was an era that gave rise to labor unions, and open warfare between employers and unions.  Accounts are available elsewhere of incidents such as the Everett Massacre.<br />It should be noted that the author received the 1940 Pulitzer Prize in fiction for this novel.  He later received the Nobel Prize in literature.
0743243307|4.0|Monica Ali's debut novel is a good, but not great read. Normally I devour novels such as these that have roots in Eastern culture, but this story although it opened well seemed to drag along in the middle section of the book. To me it seemed as if the story was drawn out in order to fill pages. The essence of the story, for me at least, was lost in the middle part of the novel. Fortunately the thread of the novel was found again in a triumphant conclusion.
2070102645|5.0|This novel is one of the all-time classics in literature.  It is a compelling story of a simple working man, Jean Valjean, caught up in the French \\"justice\\" system of the 19th century.  His crime was petty.  He broke into a bakery to get bread for starving family members (in the modern United States, he might have received probation).  Because the baker's family lived in the building, he was charged with breaking into an occupied dwelling and sent to prison.  In France, you were required to have a passport to travel within the country.  Released from prison, he is given the infamous \\"yellow passport\\" issued to people with criminal records.  An act of heroism allows him to obtain work without showing his passport, but his past catches up with him and he is sent to a prison galley for life for a second petty crime in his past as a \\"repeat offender.\\"<br />He escapes and recovers a cache of gold that he had buried, then rescues the orphan daughter of a woman he had known, but is pursued by the relentless policeman Javert, a man who has no compassion and enforces the law to the letter.<br />Jean Valjean is a simple man and, basicly, is trying to help other people.  The system does its best to grind him down.  It is notable that the story ends when people are taking to the streets and building barricades in a fight against the very system that led to his troubles.
080019683X|1.0|This drama about a father/daughter relationship showed some promise in the beginning with a couple of tense scenes, but unfortunately the movie became more and more predictable and uninteresting as it went along. The main plot is about a 13 year old girl (Anna Paquin) whose pets consist in a bunch of baby geese. Problem is, as the geese grow up they will have to find their own way and fly away, so the girl and her father (Jeff Daniels) try to help the birds and end up guiding them to a safe place. Basically a feel-good-movie, \\"Fly Away Home\\" lacks dramatic tension, surprising situations and a solid plot. As it is, this drama is just a piece of harmless fluff with some pretty images and lots of boring scenes that seem endless and repetitive. The acting is competent and Carroll Ballard`s direction is equally decent, but overall this cinematic experience is way too lifeless, patchy and predictable. Children may like it, though, still this is nothing more than a cliched and unconvincing family movie.  <br />Well-intended but not very challenging.
B00005JLH3|1.0|This movie is lousy because:<br />a) The drumming could have been much better. From a musical standpoint a mediocre high school marching band could play tighter and harder material. <br />b) The moral seems to be that if you're cocky enough and stubborn enough you'll eventually get what you want. The main character in this movie never grows as a person and never learns anything. He just keeps whining until he finally gets his way. <br />If you want to see good drumming and teamwork find a Drum Corps International show near you and hang out in the parking lot while they warm up.
B000002Q88|5.0|Definitely not in the traditional vein of the \\"classic Kansas sound\\". In the Spirit of Things was made in the late '80s, a time where '70s classic rock music simply wasn't happening... Notwithstanding, Kansas managed to come up with one of its best, yet more under-appreciated gems. Steve Walsh's soulful and pasionate singing combined with Steve Morse's guitar wizardry really made ITSOT a marvelous opus.     For whatever reason I didn't understand ITSOT when it was released (like probably the majority of this CD pundits). The song \\"Ghosts\\" really grabbed me from the begining, but I had failed to carefully hear the rest. I just didn't quite make an effort to listen and to understand the whole product. Several years later I dusted it off and gave it another spin... WOW! I was blown away by the sheer qualty, emotion and uniqueness of this production. Words are useless unless you actually listen to this masterpiece. Some may regard this comment as blasphemy, but now I truly believe ITSOT to be the best Kansas album ever (I own every of their CDs). It is just that incredible. Again, Steve Walsh unleashed everything he had while singing on this CD. Every song is so powerful and compelling, simply cascading with musical colors and utter brilliancy.    As an additional bonus the recording sound is almost perfect. Courtesy of Bob Ezrin, the overall production quality is so high that one can really crank the volume up and the sound will still remain crisp and powerful. Even the cover art, the lyrics, the pictures and overall artwork of the notebook inside are some of the best ever.    Regardless of what other reviewers might say against it, In the Spirit of Things is an album capable of reaching the deepest regions of your soul. It's all about intense emotions... and to me, this is what great music is all about!    An absolute must have!
B00005AQE8|5.0|Listen up. I think that 2Pac is the greatest rapper ever, and probably my favourite artist ever aswell, but I am not going to say like most people do that if you do not like it you are wack or whatever. People are entitled to their own opinions so let them be. back to the album, the only truly bad song on the album is Whatz Ya Phone #, which is good until the phone cnversation starts, which is when it fails. The highlight songs would be Cant C Me, Holla at Me, Picture Me Rollin', I Aint Mad At Cha, life Goes On, Only God Can Judge me, Heartz of Men, and the rest of the songs are just below the outstanding level of these highlights. People try to compare Tupac to Biggie to see who is the greatest rapper, but there is no comparrison. Biggie is S**T compared to Tupac's introspective, relevant, inspiring rhythmes. I know people will rate this review bad because i said Biggie was bad, but its the truth as i see it so F**k off if u disagree. <BR>PS get Royce 5'9&quot; new album Death is Certain, as it represents what Hip Hop should sound like, and is nearly on the same level as Tupac dare i say it.
B0001CNRS4|1.0|Wow, so I only watched this movie because my siblings rented it. Needless to say, they're 13 and 14 and they didn't even enjoy it. What the hell name is &quot;Honey&quot; anyway? And if Jessica Alba is so all about being &quot;Latina&quot; what is she doing pretending to be half black?? Good Lord her stupid fake little ghetto accent drove me nuts! Her dancing isn't even good. And the &quot;streets&quot; in the movie weren't even bad. Plus shouldn't &quot;the kids'&quot; focus be on education instead of having their life goal be a background booty dancer for a rap video? If you enjoy seeing a skinny fat-lipped white girl shake her non-existent ass up in the club this movie is for you!
B0001BKAEY|3.0|I wrote a review here when the movie came out in theaters. In that first review I gave Revolutions 3-stars, stating that in a theater this movie was tough to sit through, but I expected the DVD to be a better movie experience. And it was, for me. I'll give you an example (spoiler ahead)<br />Trinity has been run through by metal rods when they crash landed in the machine city. Trinity was impaled in four or five places. She should've been killed instantly, but she has something to say to Neo before kicking the bucket. She goes on, and on, and on to the point where you're ready to stand up and yell \\"DIE ALREADY!\\" at an important character that I should not want to see die, but at that point I just wanted the movie to be done already. <br />I watched the same scene here on DVD and when Trinity starts making her death-speech, I got up, went to the restroom, made myself a sandwich (ham and Swiss on wheat), got a Diet Coke out of the fridge, and then halfway from the kitchen to the TV, I changed my mind, went back to the kitchen and got a Diet Dr. Pepper instead. It was also hot in my house, so I got a class and some ice. When I sat down in front of the TV again Trinity was STILL dying. I'm not kidding, I swear it's true. But that's the cool thing about DVDs. We can get up, fast forward and even skip the whole chapter without ruining the movie-I mean we have ALL seen it already.<br />The movie is loaded, and reloaded (heh) with scenes like this. Scenes that may help illustrate the two creators' vision, but could have been much, much shorter. For many people this movie starts with Neo in the Train Station being told that \\"Love is a word\\", \\"Karma is a word\\", squawk, squawk, blah, blah. I swear I hate that program, and I'd have strangled him if I were Neo (of course if I had Neo's power in the Matrix, I'd never unplug). However, thanks to the control of DVD, for me the movie starts with Morpheus, Trinity and Seraph going to confront the Merovingian (sp).<br />It's tough forus reviewers here who are on the middle of the fence. I was terribly disappointed in the theater with this movie. I'm not going to re-hash what a thousand people here have said sucks about it, nor will I go into what people who thought it sucked didn't understand. I think different people simply have different taste in films, and how smart they are doesn't play into whether they liked The Matrix Revolutions or not. This is a question of taste which means one thing (wow I sound like the oracle): You have do decide for yourself. Rent it, rent it, rent it. It's well worth a rental if you haven't seen it yet.<br />Personally, I like this film here in my dvd player, right next to Reloaded. For me, both were better on dvd. I'm not saying Revolutions sucked- I'm not saying it's the best movie of 2003 (anyone who thinks that only saw one movie in 2003). This movie is much better at home, you can throw popcorn at the tv screen and tell that Indian program to shut up when he tells Neo \\"Love is a word\\", SHUT UP! I HATE YOU! You can't do that in a theater, and anything you find stupid about Revolutions you can declare proudly as if you were in an episode of Mystery Science Fiction Theater 3000. So the movie has flaws, and faults it has plusses too, and I hope nobody depends soley on internet reviews to make a decision about how they like this movie. Online, if you like it somehow you are in denial to the ones who didn't like it, and if you hated it then you are simply closed-minded and ignorant to the people who liked it. The internet is full of opinionated characters. Don't be influenced by opinionated people-see for yourself if the movie sucks or not. For me the movie sucks a little, and is also very good in places, and worth owning on dvd.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|The acting/emotion/originality of the matrix is dead. This whole movie relies on special effects and questions rather than entertainment. Honestly, ask anyone at your school and they will tell you that this movie was retarded. <br />The problem is that the Matrix Revolutions decided on the movie path of, &quot;Confusing = Brilliance&quot;. This system which I will abbreviate as C=B is a common system that fails. Evangelion had to have a whole movie called &quot;End of Evangelion&quot; to please viewers who were conned into the C=B system. Matrix relies on confusing the viewer with a barrage of questions and such. Also, Reloaded had the architect. Did anyone take anything out of that? Was that the most unrelenting mumbo-jumbo crap you have ever heard? Be prepared for more as Revolutions serves up some of the most confusing crap that fails to be brilliant.<br />Let me go over this again. The effects are good. The action is somewhat okay at times because of this. The acting is crap though and the dialogue is cheesy. On top of that we have use of the C=B system. Avoid this movie as it will just insult you.
B00009UW0N|5.0|John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN is the greatest movie of of the 3 horror slasher films( Friday, elm st. and Halloween). And this new DVD is the greatest! Most horror movies when they come out on DVD barley have 1 disc, but this new 25th version comes with 2 great disc! So many features are included in this DVD, but the really cool one is the 80 min. documentury on the making of HALLOWEEN. Buy this DVD today, its worth evry penny<br />p.s. If you eat halloween for breakfest, lunch and dinner, than get ready for HALLOWEEN 9, said to come out THIS YEAR!!!!!!!!!!
B00014TJUC|5.0|I'm not going to reiterate what was said by the previous two reviewers (I agree with them), but you may be interested to know that there is a french edition with an extra disc of four tracks (Idaho, Anthem For Bored Youth, Girl Least Likely, and All Things); it is entitled &quot;Absent Friends Companion&quot; - you know, like the &quot;Casanova Companion&quot;, only all these are unreleased studio recordings.  Now if you go on Amazon.com France (see the &quot;Directory of Amazon.com stores&quot; at the bottom of your screen) the price is about 16 Euros.  When I ordered this, for some reason the price became 13 Euros and change, I added the express shipping and the total came to $36 (I don't know what the price would be if you ordered slower shipping).  I ordered on a Sunday and received the discs on the following Thursday - I was bowled over!  So if you're going to order this import, do yourself a favour and order the limited french edition while you're spending the money (it'll probably end up being cheaper than this $34 disc when you include shipping).  If you don't care about the extra disc, then wait 'til May 4 when the domestic release comes out at around $17.  By the way all the extra tracks are worthy of being included on this wonderful album.  Just FYI.
B00003CWPL|5.0|My favorite movie of all time, but I don't see how that makes me some kind of a far left Socialist as the previous reviewer implies of anyone who thinks that, in fact I'd consider myself right long before left if I had to pin myself to either. Regardless, this movie is art not politics, and the two have never had an association to each-other outside of stereotyping & propaganda.<br />Eraserhead; A film for Right extremists, too.
0345446798|5.0|I have loved every word of &quot;The other end of the leash&quot;<BR>Its a bright,intelligent and fun book about dogs AND people, and why we do the things we do around dogs.It focuses on human behaviour as well as in canine(after all,we're human animals)making it so much easier to understand doggie language,and realizing the mistakes we make in dealing with animals.Once I started reading it I couldnt put it down,and I will certainly read other books by Patricia McConnell,I have recomended this book to everyone!
B000084T18|2.0|Now a days rap isn't judged by talent. Where were you the day rap died? It's the day when Eminem released his first LP, he has ruined rap and 50 cent CAN'T rap. You mindless white teenagers listen to this and think it makes you sound cool. But in reality you are too stupid to understand 2pac, Onyx, Wu tang and other good rappers. The only reason women like 50 cent is because he's &quot;hot&quot;, only reason some guys like 50 cent is because they are f*cking idiots.
B000002OTL|5.0|Few directors have as good an ear for the music to put to their films as does Quentin Tarantino. Martin Scorsese definitely is in the same league, but for so many films Q.T. has it down and Pulp Fiction is perhaps the best of the lot. Just look at the playlist and you'll see how these songs range from the quirky to the funky to the moody to out and out intrigue, just like the film. And the dialogue sprinkled throughout sort of inverts the roles: it's as if the movie is backdrop for the soundtrack. This is a great assembly of songs.

B00005JLEU|5.0|There's only one word to summarise this movie, 'wow!'. It's a movie well done and is one of the best movies in the modern era. I've seen it for a countless number of times and still continue to do so, and each time I do, I watch it as though I am watching it for the very first time. <BR>If you haven't seen this movie yet, I recommend you to buy it rather than rent it. I promise that you won't be disappointed  =)
B00009V7RF|5.0|I didn't think to much of this album after hearing where is the love. I figured shut up and where is the love was the best the album had to offer. Then I decided to listen to the whole album and I was rather surprised. This is a very good album for its genre. Nothing revolutionary but its has a refreshing sounds. Alot of lasting quality. When listening to it you'll skip no more then three songs if any.
B0001Z363W|1.0|Sorry die-hard fans but no matter how much you talk of open mind this or song writing that I can't get over the fact that this is a pretty crap selection of slow, piano or acoustic driven tracks that just do not fit the criteria when you go out and by a BLS album.<br />There should be a label on the CD saying &quot;WARNING:This is CD contains no decent monster riffs or songs of any real pace&quot;<br />Almost every song begins with a lonely single instrument strumming or tapping its way into another depressing verse and a chorus that makes you scream for an overdrive pedal. The CD starts slow and never bothers to change course.<br />I love Zakk, but man this stinks. I know music writers should be free to express themselves, but if you're gonna change so dramatically from your last (10 out of 10) album, then for christs sake tell the fans who are about to spend there hard earned dosh, change your name, do something!!<br />I got this CD before a long drive. By the time I arrived where I was going I new it was going back.I will check out the next BLS offering, but with less excitment and more caution.<br />Sorry Zakk, not eveything you touch turns to gold. In fact this turned into something much softer, and smellier!!
B00005JM0B|3.0|'I'll be back:' good the first and second time, but for the third?  Well, I really, really wish that this had turned out to be a better movie.  I really enjoyed the first two, but I can understand how they would be hard to top!<br />How many more upgrades can a terminator get?  And sheesh, why would it need so many?!  The T2 Terminator could have wiped out the humans!  Oh well, she did have some cool stuff up her sleeve.  :)<br />I didn't really like the choice of actors for John Connor.  Too bad Eddie Furlong wasn't hired, at least he would look like him!  And he just didn't seem to fit the part.  And the part of the Terminator to Arnold, I mean come on...oh wait, just joking.<br />Haha...well, overall, the graphics and action were really cool, and it was neat seeing the other, 'older' versions of the Terminators, but because the story line was weak, the acting a little bad, I just have to give it 3 out of 5.<br />Hopefully, Arnold won't be back for a fourth!
B00000JCOV|1.0|I honestly dont know what to say for this kind of music.  The only reason i listen to slipknot is just becuase i am amused by the fact they are so bad.  Lyrically i'd say they do a pretty good job in thier album Iwoa,( even if you do have to actually look up every single line becuase you cant understand them,) but this album is just ridiculus. Im up and open for new things but i just dont think this band has any talent.  Then to my surprise i find out that this band consists of NINE people!!?!  Maybe they should pull their ridiculusly masked heads out of thier butts and start making some real music instead of repepitive boring psuedo-metal trash that only retarted teenage boys will buy.  I don't know why all my freinds love this crap.
B000002H97|5.0|I agree with the editorial review that says this album as a whole is Metallica's best album. The songs are more polished, the sound is more mature, everything is better. I believe Metallica reached its peak of perfection with this one. As far as the complex harmony structures of albums like Puppets, Justice..., or this &quot;black&quot; album, that is no weakness, it is one of Hetfield's best and defining qualities as a songwriter. What he tried to achieve and DID achieve in this area is really great, but then unfortunately he moved away from it. His old buddy Dave Mustaine and Megadeth tried to write more polished and melodically complex and technically mature songs back in those days too, and they succeeded at it as well. But I guess times change. I hate the brand new Metallica album. This old one is a million times better in just about every way.<br />David Rehak<BR>authir of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B000002C4J|5.0|Well, after a smash hit like Falling Into You, Celine put out this follow-up. It sold like Falling Into You as well, at about 10 million copies. This album is about love, hence the title. These are my favorites:<br />THE REASON: This song is a ballad of course, with Celine telling a lover how much they mean to her. Her voice is in top-notch here.<br />IMMORTALITY: With help from the Bee Gees, Celine tells the story of her ended relationship and how it will always be inside her heart. She doesn't use her impressive range much here, but still an excellent song.<br />TELL HIM: People seem to hate this song. I don't get why. The two powerful voices of Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand make an otherwise lame song amazing. The lyrics are cliched, but they make up for it by using their all in the range area. <br />MY HEART WILL GO ON: Everyone knows this one. It's played out, but no one can deny the powerful vocals of Ms. Dion. It is a prototype of her great ballads, building up slowly to an earth-shattering, chest-thumping climax that we've come to expect from Celine.<br />TO LOVE YOU MORE: Easily the best song on the whole album. It was overshadowed by the mighty &quot;My Heart Will Go On,&quot; but it actually surpasses that song in the musical stakes. Celine pours her body and soul into this amazing song, and it's never gotten old with me through the years I've been listening to it.<br />If those songs aren't enough, just listen to the others. All the songs on this CD are great. Let's Talk About Love should be considered the end-all, be-all of Celine's music. If it weren't for the amazing Falling Into You, this would be her best. It is a close second, however. But why are you wasting time reading this review? GO OUT AND GET IT!
B00005JMX6|5.0|There have been films in the past that have tanked at the box office and nobody saw them and that was the end of it. Then there are films that tanked at the box office, then slowly, over time, and audience grew and the films became classics that every household in the world new about in one way or another. This is one of those films. IT IS A CLASSIC. It is such an admirable, hilarious, inspiring and solid piece of story telling. This is a film you come out of changed (for the better). Elisha Cuthbert is sexy as hell and plays a very convincing character. She is the \\"Marty McFly\\" of the film in that, she doesn't change as a character, but the ones around her do. Bring in Emile Hirsch. His character is one that does change, his arc is great because he starts out as kind of a insecure nerd that wants more and by the end of the story he's a confident, successful, inspiring guy. This film deserves to be seen, but sadly, it wasn't. Making only under $20 million at the box office. Needn't worry, slowly, over time, this will be on the shelves with \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\", \\"Caddyshack\\", \\"Animal House\\" etc. This is a comedy, but it is a comedy with brains and emotion. Sharpness and wit. It is rememberable (if thats even a word). It is a very similar \\"Risky Business\\" but with this one, you care for the characters so much more. And how many films, today, can you compare similarities to one another in some way or form! One actor of spectacular mention is Timothy Olyphant. He plays Kelly, probably one of the most hilarious and likable villains of all time. He's almost not a villain at all. He's just an awesome bad ass. Every single guy (age 18-25) that I talked to about that character said that he was their hero, and inspiration! and I agree.(Olyphant, you are the man). Another great mention is the capturing of high school life. The filmmakers really tapped into what high school was, better than any film has done before. I got all the memories back when watching the first 5 minutes. It's amazing. Whoever is reading this, please, trust me. I mean, the average star review for this film is 4 1/2 out of 5. Can we all be wrong? Really, this film is so worthy of watching. I've seen it 3 times and I plan to see it one more before DVD. Then it's mine forever, in the collection. AMONG THE CLASSICS (Where it belongs).
B00005JMCN|4.0|Exceptional acting, breathtaking scenery and an inspirational story. How could one go wrong.<br />To be honest, I was leary of trying this movie. Normailly, these cliche 'underdog' movies don't sit well with me. I'm also not a big fan of sports movies. As a huge sports fan I feel like most movies don't do justice to the 'real thing.' Reviewers promised that since the film was based on a true story it would not seem as sappy or predictable,but I am always suspicious of 'based on a true story' anyway.<br />In the end the movie did not disappoint. The first hour seemed a little slow, and frankly I was not sure I would make it through. I'm glad I did. Not really sure if too much could have been removed. Part of the appeal at the end is the kinship you feel with the characters due to your history together. Some would say it was worth it, but it seems unfortunate to me that somtimes we have to justify the beginning of a movie by saying the ending is better. ? Truth is, though -- this is one of those movies! If you get bored, just joke about it like we did and keep watching.
B000002WYT|3.0|i understand where all the one-star reviews are coming from; opinions that hate dave matthews band for putting out mindless drivel on lame subject matter.  but i have to disagree.  to me, crash is about feeling good, about relaxing to moving sound.  not really about complexity in lyricism or songs that are necessarily 'about' something.  i have no idea what #41 is about, but its one of the prettiest songs i've ever heard.  and that song alone is worth the bucks, or at least a couple more stars
B00006JIA4|5.0|(...)Disc 1 and Disc 2 of this box set are the great songs, disc 3 is not that good. But the price is totally worth it just for those first two! Queen is the classic rock band that will have to go down as one of the all-time greats. Even if there had never been \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", there are SO many other great tunes these guys created as well. Freddie Mercury had freakishly bad buck teeth and was a gay guy who died of Aids, but he was a golden individual in about a million different ways, and nothing can take away anything from the glory of this band. Their best songs are eternal.<br />David Rehak (...)
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first bought this album I thought it would be like any other cd I've ever bought, I always get bored of them. And when I listened to it, I really didn't like it at first. But as time went on I loved it more and more. <BR>  I am in my own band as the lead singer, everyone is blown away by my voice. But this girl, Amy, the lead singer of Evanescence has the highest vocal range I've ever heard. She has so much control over her voice. <BR>  The band is so talented, though I think the guitar parts in the verses could improve. The guitar part only have some rythmic beat to Amy's voice in the verses. The notes that she sings are beautiful and amazing. In the drumming in &quot;My Last Breath&quot; at the end of the song is unbelievable! <BR>  On with my point, this is how I rate each song indavidualy. <BR>1. Going Under-5/5. The lyrics are dark and heavy, it's a song that I can relate to. Before I got this CD I've heard this song in my sleep once and more.<BR>2. Bring Me to Life-4/5. I can play the piano parts to this easily. I loved this song, but I hear people singing it all the time, they SUCK at singing. If they want to sing, at least sing it right. It's on the radio all the time. And they have the singer from 6 Stones sing too. But overall, I give it a 4 out of 5.<BR>3. Everybody's Fool-5/5. This song was obviously written to God. The lyrics, &quot;Never was and never will be, you're not real and you can't save me,&quot; shout out that the song is dedicated to god. &quot;No flaws when you're pretending&quot;, &quot;Just what we all need, more lies about a world that never was and never will be, you don't know how you've betrayed me-&quot; It's a great song.<BR>4. My Immortal-5/5. I like their newer version of this song better. I can play the entire song on the piano while singing with no problem. Can I find music that I can't play?<BR>5. Huanted-5/5. An evil, dark song for the Devil. Just what I like, right?<BR>6. Tourniquet-4.5/5. They just had to stick this Christian song right after the demonic song. This osng is about their salvation from God.<BR>7. Imaginary-4/5. The string's part of this song are beautiful alon gwith her voice. She sings about her &quot;sleeping refuge&quot; and her &quot;rampant chaos.&quot; Beautiful.<BR>8. Taking Over Me-5/5. The best song on this album! I even dedicate it to a person that I haven't seen for a long time. We knew eachother for a few days, love first sight. Haven't seen him ever since that fateful day....<BR>9. Hello-5/5. Beautiful piano chords to this song. She hits one onote that is UNBELIEVABLE. In this song it sings about being ignored. That's the way I see it.<BR>10. Holding My Last Breath-5/5. This is a romantic but cold song. Someone must've died in her life.<BR>11. Whisper-5/5. Another great song added to my favorites list. This song I don't mind having stuck in my head while taking a test. <BR> The next song I won't rate, it's the same as #4. I dedicate it to the love I lost. &quot;I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone...&quot; I love this song. It makes me sick listening to it, though I love it....And him.............
B00008NRI8|4.0|When I watch a romantic comedy (I admit -- I usually enjoy them), I don't really expect much comedy. The point is the love story, right? Of course there are exceptions to this rule, but in most cases my wife and I watch these movies together because we enjoy the predictable storylines and the 'Awwwww' moments sprinkled throughout.<br />If you like your romantic comedies to be genuinely funny, this movie is not for you. If you are interested in a feel-good love story (predictability aside), you should see this film. Sandra Bullock's character is the same combination of cute and neurotic that her fans have grown to love, and Hugh Grant provides the little bit of comedy you will discover in this movie.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|I bought this DVD last year, I thouroughly enjoy it- Whitney speaks on it, and it has tons of videos I 've never seen.  Producers, song writers speak of whitney, its and excellent all-around DVD, I recommend you to purchase this DVD, its just Excellent.
B000002H97|5.0|I agree with the editorial review that says this album as a whole is Metallica's best album. The songs are more polished, the sound is more mature, everything is better. I believe Metallica reached its peak of perfection with this one. As far as the complex harmony structures of albums like Puppets, Justice..., or this &quot;black&quot; album, that is no weakness, it is one of Hetfield's best and defining qualities as a songwriter. What he tried to achieve and DID achieve in this area is really great, but then unfortunately he moved away from it. His old buddy Dave Mustaine and Megadeth tried to write more polished and melodically complex and technically mature songs back in those days too, and they succeeded at it as well. But I guess times change. I hate the brand new Metallica album. This old one is a million times better in just about every way.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Read reviews of \\"Blow Up\\" and you'll find a huge diversity of opinion. It's a masterpiece... it's rubbish... it's tantalisingly complex... it's hedonistically superficial... what happens in the film is \\"real\\"... nothing that happens in the film is \\"real\\"... and so it goes. Watch the film and take your choice, but the fact that it still generates such reactions is a testament to its enduring impact. So what does it have? <br />Well, on the down side, a lot of the acting is weak, the musical soundtrack is too self-consciously \\"hip\\", and several of the scenes appear to have been inserted purely for effect - \\"we do nudity, drugs and rock &amp; roll as well as making films\\". And on the plus side? David Hemmings acting is superb, the cinema-photography is brilliant, and the use of sound (and silence) to create atmosphere is stunningly effective. But beneath all that's superficially good &amp; bad there's something much, much deeper. Firstly, a riddle that drives it and to which there's no answer - in simple terms, what's real and what's not? Antonioni poses this question throughout the film, from the heavily handed obvious (the play acting of the mime troupe), the subtle (the fact that Hemmings' character is never referred to by name), to the brilliantly tense darkroom scenes where his photos are \\"blown up\\" to levels that make interpretation of what he and we are \\"seeing\\" impossible. Secondly, and even more subtle, is this man's life simply play acting itself - has he become nothing by having everything - is he still \\"real\\"?<br />Deep stuff and a film that is, as a result, a fascinating enigma in its plot, its execution and people's reaction to it.
B00000613T|5.0|Let's go to the point:this one and Abbado 's 1999 Berlin concerto(released in 2002),are both must have,for the very unique quality they own.Actually, i consider them a complemented-relationed set.<BR>Boulez's version is the perfect 'sounding score' (or call it 'score text book')you can ever find in the market.I can hear you laughing, but do you think it's easy to do a recording to make you feel : yes, the tempi is just right, the structure just clear, phrasing just natural,the dynamic-range,logic-accent,the expression,all the details,inner-voices etc..shortly: evey thing is just right in this recording.(VERY probaly: in every recording of Boulez's Mahler cycle)Let the music do the talking, when every thing is rightly in its place, the music of Mahler will shine by itself. Boulez seemas totally unforced,and he is truelly a Maestro.<BR>weakness: the  playing is not that good. Don't take me wrong, the playing is very fine,proffesional, and you can hear all those half-million valued instruments thanks to cristal clean 4D recording.<BR>After learning the sounding score of this symphony,you may want to experience it in live. Just try Abbado's last one. The choice of tempi in first movement is little fast,it could even sound a little 'confused',don't worry,you will eventually find out that Abbado's choice is more than reasonable,(i mean: compare to the Boulez's to find out what should be the 'correct structrue',how the climatix should be distributed in sections, etc.) very suitble for Berliners' playing.oh,the Berliner's playing,is, more than beyond beautiful,more than breathtaking...(now you know why i cant enjoy the Chicago's playing) I own 400 classical recordings, no one comes nearly close to this one.<BR>So, buy this one for the natural power of the muisc from Mahler,and later go to Abbado for what the power of the music could be transformed to power of playing.
B000053VAF|1.0|I wish I could rate this two ways. I believe it should get 5+ stars for it's illumination of one modern Catholic's mindset, but must give it 1 star for how wrongheaded the enterprise was written and directed. The director, Kevin Smith, has called this film &quot;...my love-letter to God and to faith - which is about the only thing we really truly have in life.&quot;<br />This should surprise a great number of the critics of this film who wrongly believe Smith is slamming the Church. He further states, &quot;Faith is the glue that holds us together and binds us (kind of like the Force). It's something we all have in common - even if you're not a religious person.&quot; Clearly this shows he is NOT the faithless iconoclast as portrayed by the good-hearted but misguided efforts of the Catholic League, but rather this is a man whose movie is a statement of his faith as he understands it. And while it is intentionally satirical of many things, if viewed not as a slam but as a love-letter, a well catechized Catholic can gain some pretty incredible insights from it.<br />I'm not promoting this movie in regards to how well it expresses the Catholic Faith - far from it. It is wildly inaccurate and largely ignorant of history or of the arguments that underlie fundamental beliefs of (most) Catholics. But there is a payoff.<br />Watch this movie and realize something: this is a product of a mind formed by a lifetime of Catholic schools. Smith himself has said that the inspiration for this movie came from a nun who taught religion. <br />This man's imagination was formed by those whose grasp of the truth of the gospels and the church were as murky and erroneous as they were (doubtless) devout and sincere. It's simply bad modernist theology played out on the big screen. This is perhaps the key to Smith's confusion on the part of orthodox Catholics who take umbrage to his opus. He isn't the devil incarnate, a ridiculing and blasphemous jerk who's trying to take a stab at the religion and faith of millions. Rather, Smith simply doesn't get it. And though we are all responsible for our own actions, take heed of this example and feel pity for this man who has been sold a theological bill of goods that doesn't quite add up in the light of day. See this film; discuss with others its merits good and bad. But above all, make sure you know what your own children are taught as regards their faith. Don't depend on a school's clout or reputation - see what's going on with your own eyes. Finally, pray not only for Smith, but for schools that market themselves as Catholic. Pray that they become capable once again of teaching leaders of tomorrow like Smith to once again be unabashedly, unashamedly, and unambiguously Catholic.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Kudoes to film music composer Michael Kamen for taking some great Metallica songs and making them even greater! The songs sound more complete, just richer. When you have so many more instruments added, the whole thing just sounds so much more melodically diverse. A very nice mix. I wish I could give it 10 stars.<br />This (live) S&amp;M thing is also on video or dvd. I recommend you see it as well as hear it, seeing it adds a whole new dimension to the sound. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
0812550706|5.0|This book is very well-written, if not a bit formulaic in style. The story is original and the author presents a very interesting idea about space combat that I'm surprised hasn't made it's way into a cheap video game yet. <br />Unfortunately, the author spends too much time alluding to some commonly-addressed problems with humanity and much of the conversation sounds contrived. Happily, none of these things detract from the entertainment value of the book.
B0000DBJDM|1.0|The thing about Pink Floyd is that when they are good they are brilliant but when they are bad (as with this movie) they are horrible. They have made classic albums that have stood the test of time such as Meddle, Dark Side and Wish you were here. But they have also made garbage. This usually happens when they let Roger Waters get carried away with his sound effects fetish. This movie displays the worst of Pink Floyd. How anyone can give this 4 or 5 stars is beyond me. I guess dropping acid before you watch it may be the trick. But for the sober crowd it is a big waste of time and money. One of the more annoying aspects of this movie: watching one of the best rock guitarists of the 70's, David Gilmour, sit on the ground and run a steel slide up and down his fretboard while Roger Waters bangs a gong (Gee-wiz I think I could do that). For some unforseen reason the interviewer/director badgers them about whether or not they fight with each other. He seems obsessed with that topic and whether or not they think Rock is dead. (It would be if Director Adrian was in charge). Bottom line - if you like sound effects and juvenile chatter then by all means blow your money on this \\"movie\\". If you want to listen to the Floyd play great music and speak intelligently about their recordings then buy the Dark Side DVD.

B000068IEU|5.0|From humble beginnings, comes greatness. I hate to see a film such as this being trashed by people that don't understand how important something like this is in the film industry. There's something more important here than just the average slasher movie. Think about the time when this movie was made. In 1972, these films were only made from a select group of people. People like John Waters, Tobe Hooper, and all the masters under the thumb of Roger Corman had a mission and a clean canvas of the times. Before them, there was nothing. Now in their wake, all the rest come.<br />I protect this film for the fact of what it was ORGINAL in its time, and a piece of art that has endured through the years. <br />Recently, I received information regarding a reunion, movie and memorabilia expo in Ohio, which reunites some of the original cast of Last House on the Left. For these people alone, this movie launched careers and began something new in the movies that people would never get tired of. <br />Scripted and shot on a low-string budget, Last House on the Left has reached beyond what most of the producers at the time thought possible. Other than \\"another drive-in\\" movie, this still has watchers in awe of its brilliance. Look beyond the high-cost brain-candy that is spun out today like recycled dryer lint, and see the film for the first time all over again. Whether you squint or just watch straight through without blinking, you'll find some wholesome horror entertainment. <br />For you people out there that read other reviews about how bad the film it, as yourself, does it have to be a masterpiece of Francis Ford Coppola to come out of 1972 to be worth a look? No! For anyone that like to follow the production line of certain directors, this is for those that appreciate the film for what it was and what it still is...The Last House on the Left!
0783233477|4.0|Wow, this movie starts of excellent. The story develops at a good pace, it is interesting and I'm excited to watch the rest of the movie. Of course that changes after the coffee shop scene, and it really takes an unexpected turn that makes you completely unaware of what is going to happen afterwards. And unfortunately, not to ruin anything, I didn't exactly think the story was structured well after that. Don't get me wrong, I could see how this would be great as an old, classic story on film, which it is. But my feeling was with such great, modern dramatic set up for a dilemma in the film and the way it made the viewer feel, the real important part of the story seemed mis-developed. I thought Brad Pitt's character was too unknowing and should've been more selectively naive, shall I say. It got irritating and ridiculous to see him fool around for so long, ridiculousness that would make the movie better and more legitimate if it was removed or modified. The movie also tries to take simple and personal exchanges of words realistic and heartfelt, but somehow misses a sense of sincerity that the film possessed at the beginning very well, something that makes them more genuine and basically believeable, which the story relies on very much. Some scenes called for awkwardness between the characters, but the amount of awkwardness was subdued and the result was that it seemed a little silly, like they had more to say. Scenes between Hopkins and his daughters are good, and great acting. But Brad Pitt is unfairly characterized as the good guy in this movie, because anyone who's job, girl, and mentor was being taken by a random punk would be pissed as well. But Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt, and this is his role, which is the producers' fault for not writing a more dynamic and exciting character for him (dynamic in the sense that he pushes dialogue rather than simply observes others for 90 minutes). But hey, I am nitpicking and this is a great movie, different but much better than I expected. I liked the length, and the end is subtle but I think works well. See it for sure, Hopkins is a great actor and you will feel good about the important things in life afterward. Aside from criticism, this movie is really great, and I really got good feelings from it all the way through, including tragedy to (all kinds of) love.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles White Album has been called the greatest rock album of all time. While I disagree with this (Rubber Soul/Revolver should be) I do think it is one of the greatest, or at least most recognized, achievements of the Beatles. There are relatively few songs out of the thirty that no one recognizes and can't sing along with.  These may be ... or rather ... no, every single one of these songs are recognizable and are known to every single person who listens to music. Or they should be anyhow. Buy the CD and relive the Beatles experience.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|What I loved most about this film is that it doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience but asks the viewer to make the connections. Peter Weir is a brilliant filmmaker who allows the camera to unfold the story. From the opening scene to the final battle, he doesn't allow a lot of exposition where the characters go into lengthy explanation to a dumbed down audience. Every scene is organic and the rich details tell the narrative. The acting is just first rate and Crowe is miraculous when depicting the character's inner conflict. I also love the fact that the dialogue had not been watered down. Sailors exchange with lightning fast speed authentic nautical jargon. By the end of the film one feels fully immmersed in the experience. Great stuff.
B0000UJL96|3.0|My Rating: 3.5/5.0 stars.<br />After Star Trek V, which DID stink (sorry, Bill!), the powers that be did what everyone would hope they did: hire back Nick Meyer, who directed Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, to do a rescue.  And while this movie does not hit the high standard set by that film, it is a very respectable bit of sci-fi fun and ended the whole series on a positive note.<br />If Meyer can be faulted for anything, it is for trying to stuff too much, well, STUFF in one film.  This movie has political intrigue, an assassination plot, a murder mystery (!), some courtroom drama (!!), a prison break (!!!), a cat-and-mouse starship battle (shades of Khan?), then caps everything off with the wrap-up of the political intruge/multiple assassination plotline you almost forgot about with all the other stuff in-between.  As Meyer might have said, but as far as I know never did, &quot;Oy, vey!&quot;<br />On the upside, almost everything is well done, so the end result is a fun Star Trek movie that, much like &quot;The Wrath of Khan,&quot; is also very accessible, even if it lacks the sheer visceral punch of that Star Trek high-water-mark.  Kudos, too, for the DVD extras, which have been consistently excellent in the latest run of Paramount 2-DVD Star Trek sets.

B00006IU73|5.0|I first heard porcupine tree two years ago when they opened up for Yes. When i heard this music, i ran out of the hall and bought their cd right away. the only one they had out there was in absentia, and i listen to it all the time. mix alt-rock with classic-rock and you'll have porcupine tree. the haunting melodies and emotional vocals make this cd a great buy.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|OK, I'm in my 40's but I love this CD. If I were to guess, I'd say there influences were T-Rex, Beatles, and AC/DC. They have a nice sound of there own but the music reminds me of these bands. A must have for your cd collection.
0800177177|5.0|I have always loved the story of dracula with its gothic mysticism and romantic intrigue. Have recently bought a dvd player and the Bram Stokers Dracula DVD was a 'must have' for my collection as i have seen it a dozen times and intend on seeing it a dozen more. With the ability to select my fav scenes and the added features it makes it that much more special.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Directed by John Madden ''Shakespeare in Love'' was the winner of 7 academy awards including Best Picture, Best atcress, and Best supporting actress. <br />This was a great film. The sets were good, the budget obviously was big, the acting was great by Fiennes, Paltrow, Rush and others and it was very entertaining. However the movie does have many flaws though most of which were revealed<BR>on Special Edition DVD and by simple facts of history on Shakespeare himself.<BR>For instance on DVD Director John Madden does mention that he takes <BR>liberties with the film, including the depiction of future playwright John Webster as a street beggar, who gets turned by William Shakespeare. In fact, half of the film takes many liberties which scholars will debate as untrue. <br />For one is the depiction in which Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everette) seems to be the one that gives Will, all the ideas to write ''Romeo and Juliet'', including the characer of Mercutio and Romeo. I asked this to my English teacher who is<BR>a big Shakespeare buff and researched this and could find no proof that Marlowe<BR>even met with Shakespeare. So these events in the film stretched the truth.<br />The other liberty the film takes is depicting Shakespeare as a heterosexual , who loves women, when in fact, the real Shakespeare loved not only women, but young boys. Shakespeare was a bisexual but you research his background, you'll<BR>(...) <BR>his Sonnets, for an unknown young man. <br />The good points of the film is that several depictions of Elizabethan life are factual. <BR>Throughout the 13 to 1600's, the plays written by Shakespeare and Marlowe were largely unknown. Since, the Bubonic Plague was rampant this also <BR>posed a problem for potential audiences. <br />Elizabethan theatres, like Shakespeare, chronically were unsactioned and held gambling and prostitution in between and after plays. <br />There is also the debate of Viola De Lesseps(Gwenyth Paltrow's character) who falls in lovewith Shakespeare. In fact my English colleagues, told me, that there is <BR>no proof that Viola ever existed. <br />Shakespeare in Love is about young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) who is struggling to make his new play (which would end to be ''Romeo and Juliet'')<BR>to make ends meet. <br />His friend and business partner Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) is literally almost killed for the debts he owes , along with the fact that the theather he manages <BR>has failed to show a profit. Shakespeare, then with a little help from Chris Marlowe, <BR>(Scholars say that Shakespeare didn't even know Marlowe) gets the idea to make ''Romeo and Juliet'' (his most famous love tragedy). <br />Everything from the beginning goes wrong to make the play until Shakespeare finds a good actor named Thomas kent who is really a woman played named Viola De Lesseps (Gwenyth Paltrow). <br />Shakespeare at first doesn't know that Kent is a woman, but when he does, is when the funny action starts. However, all is not well, as Viola is in love a loveless <BR>engagement with another man Lord Wesses (Colin Firth). <br />The famous playwright then must know find a way to finish his play and not lets his feelings get in the way for Viola, because it could mean the end of his life. <br />As I said the movie takes many liberties with the ''facts'' of Shakespeare, and more than half of the movie is filled with uncomfirmed, evidence on Shakespeare. <br />As I said, Shakespeare had an incredible desire for young boys, and it's illogical that Shakespeare would have fallen for this woman Viola so rapidly in the film. <br />In fact, there is part of the film that does show some of Shakespeare, homosexuality. The film also inaccurately says that Chris Marlowe and <BR>Shakespeare well old friends, but against there is no evidence showing that. <br />Despite that, ''Shakespeare in Love'' is a pretty entertaining film that showcases what life was like during Shakespeare's time. <br />The DVD for the film comes with many extras including: <br />* A special feature on the making of the film <BR>* A special look at the costumes made for the film. <BR>* Over 5 Deleted scenes. <BR>*Commentary from the Director. <BR>*A special section showing a couple of facts on the real Shakespeare and much more. <br />So if you haven't seen the movie check it out and check out the DVD too.
B000002UCN|4.0|This looked like a great buy. It has almost all of my favorite songs. However, the Bealtes-era songs are just taken off old albums. I thought that they would be re-recorded versions, but they were not. The sound quality of this cd is also rather poor. However, it does concnetrate all of George's best into one cd. It's an ok buy, but if you are a Beatles/George fanatic, it is unnecessary.
1401300901|4.0|This book was great, from beginning to end.  At times, it was pretty predictable, but that made the story no less heartwarming.  I felt like I was right there with the characters and I totally empathized with them.  Anyone who loves a good happy read, this was a great book.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Yeah, you do the math. Christmas in July, 3.2%. What I'm trying to say, is that this album is better than Kid A. As you may or may not know, Amnesiac is part of Kid A, but I think that the songs are stronger and have more of an impact on audiences due to the fact that each song is totally different in composition from one to the next. It has some weird sounding beats, like 3 and 10, but I think the opening track along with 2, 4, 5, and 6 and even the last track are reason enough to get this addition to the best mainstream band out there. Now go fry up some frog legs and don't touch the flames, but keep this little gem in the back of your brain, and let yourself drift into the mad mad world of Radiohead. Yeah, this is my favorite album of theirs, a close second is Hail To The Thief, that one, HTTT, was better produced and longer, but this one here, is better I think.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Dreamworks Shrek is one of the best technical by then in quite some time<br />Shrek was not just a box office hit, but it was a hit among childrens and fans of all ages. Shrek's success lay on Dreamworks success formula of mixing in all their previous characters that audiences loved, along with making a great adventure that had audiences entertained.<br />I have watched the movie before several but the dvd is amazing, it's literally<BR>like watching the movie all over again with the featuretts and some added<BR>scenes .<br />The movie Shrek also had a great number of musical songs used in the movie such as Smashmouth's ''All Star'', Willie Nelson's ''On The Road Again'', ''The Pina Colada Song'' by Robert Holmes.<br />Shrek (Michael Myers) is not your typical fairy tale hero, which is another reason why audiences loved the movie. Shrek is proof that not every hero needs to be a tall, perfect being that rescues the princess.<br />Shrek is virtually a whose who of all fairy tales: Pinocchio, The 3 Little Pigs, The Big<BR>Bad Wolf from Little Red Riding Hood, are just a couple examples of fairy tale characters provide not only humor, but another chance for kids and audiences to love their fairy tale character that they heard as kids.<br />Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) evicts all the Fairy Tale Creatures from their homes, and makes them move to the swamp.<br />Farquaad in a funny scenes tries to capture the big, loving orge, Shrek outside his kingdom of Duloc, but Shrek defeats the men in a hilarious display including a spoof of wrestling.<br />The wrestling spoof done by Shrek is absolute hilarious is no doubt a shot at Pro Wrestling at it's best.<br />Farquaad helpless against Shrek, offers him the chance to get his swamp back but tells Shrek that he must complete a special journey to get his home back. <br />That journey of course entails not only Shrek defeating a mysterious dragon,<BR>but a beautiful princess named Fiona (Cameron Diaz).<br />Fiona is the beautiful princess who is somewhat chained to Lord Farquaad<BR>but who dreams of being rescued by a great knignt of course that's when<BR>Shrek comes in...<br />The ending was a bit of a surprise but it was a welcome surprise, in fact<BR>compared to that garbage of a movie called ''Shallow Hal'' , ''Shrek'' actually<BR>does live up to theme of the inner beauty within someone to find love.<br />The DVD is loaded, I mean loaded with special features, in fact I think that the Academy Awards should add a category for best DVD'S because they are alot of great dvd's out there that deserve their awards.<br />The DVD of Shrek is one such great dvd, it comes loaded with many features including:<br />Trailer of The Film<BR>Interview with the Cast of The Film (In their Animated form)<BR>HBO First Look at Shrek<BR>A Tech Look at the Making of Shrek<BR>A Sneak Peek at other upcoming animated films<BR>A Special hint section for the XBOX game of Shrek<BR>A Special Dubbing featurette<BR>and many more features!!!<br />So check out the movie and check the dvd, now that Shrek 2 is coming out<BR>in the summer, a revisit and reviewing of the original seems very appropriate
B000002UB3|5.0|With the exception of a few songs, this is much like a rock opera. Comparable to The Who's Tommy or another Beatle's album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band. Many people look at this as a sad attempt, not quite up to par with the White Album or Revolver, but I disagree. Despite the fact that I dislike &quot;long songs,&quot; I can sit and listen to Abbey Road for hours on end. It combines the eclectic mix of song types of the White Album with the rock opera aspect of Sgt. Peppers'. Anybody who likes a great mix of memorable music will love Abbey Road.

B00012FXAE|5.0|I must be one of the few people that, while finding 'director's cuts' interesting, still prefer to have the original theatrical release of a film.  Now I have the theatrical release of Aliens I'm a happy man.  I liked the tighter pace and even one less piercing scream from Newt is a bonus in my book.<br />Of course, with this DVD you can have the pleasure of either version of the movie as you wish!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Where to even begin. Hmm...<br />&quot;No. These are not talented musicians.&quot;<br />The entire world differs with you. Including almost every single musician you can name. <br />&quot;Beethoven and Mozart were talented musicians.&quot;<br />They were talented composers. Tchaikovsky was a talented composer AND a godlike musician. See the difference? The Beatles were talented composers and talented musicians. They also incorporated a lot of other music, such as the Indian Sitar and the African Box Drum. <br />&quot;These four British punks were barely able to play their instruments and could not write songs for the pitiful lives of them.&quot;<br />First, of all, they are the #1 band in the world according to the VH1 poll of MUSICIANS as well as the #1 band in the world according to the poll of LISTENERS. Their #1's attest to how well they can write songs. Music is meant to move and inspire the listeners; it is meant to convey an emotion, to describe a memory, to inspire and to relate. The Beatles have inspired and influenced more people on the face of this planet then all classical composers combined. The Beatles are lauded by not only critics, but fans and fellow musicians.<br />&quot;Stop saying it's good music just because everyone else is.&quot;<br />Kind of you to tell us how to think. Sig Heil, Mein Fuhrer! <BR>Stop saying their music is bad because you like to be a contrarian. <br />&quot;You know they're sloppy artists.&quot;<br />Please clarify your definition of sloppy artists. As I recall, Beethoven bathed only once a year and Mozart was renowned for his terrible dining habits. <br />&quot;Listen to classical if you want good &quot;classic&quot; music.&quot;<br />Classical and Classic Rock are two different genres of music. If you mean &quot;ancient&quot; when you say &quot;classic&quot;, then listen to african tribal drum music.<br />&quot;Hector Berlioz would rip these four poofy-haired blokes a new one if he were still alive. That was a talented composer.&quot;<br />If Hector Berlioz was alive today, he'd be spewing out crap and be called OASIS or JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE. Or do you not believe that the Romantic movement is closing akin to modern pop rock? <br />&quot;This is junk, just like everything else to come out of the '70s. Nixon should've arrested them and sent them to Vietnam to be shot so they could stop making atrocious 'music.'&quot;<br />First, the last Beatles studio session that included all four band members took place on August 20, 1969. <br />Second, the Beatles were British citizens. Nixon would have no say in sending Her Majesties subjects to war in Vietnam.<br />&quot;Good thing most of them are dead now, but I wish people would stop re-releasing their music or having the members write new music. They couldn't write in their prime; what makes anyone think that an old decrepit walking corpse is going to do any good?&quot;<br />Really? They couldn't write? Even their rehashed, reboxed, regurgitated songs make it to #1 around the world. So why would you say they couldn't write when young people continue to buy 30 year old songs? Sounds like staying power and a true &quot;classic&quot; to me. Great songwriting survives the test of time. <br />&quot;Give me all the negative votes you want. In fact, why don't you email me your death threats at beatlessuck@yourmother.com. Hail Satan, and to the depths of Hades with these dogs.&quot;<br />I can see how surprisingly honest and forthright you are. If you truly feel such conviction, then you should publish your e-mail address. <br />Satan and Hades have no connection with each other, btw. And in Hades, there was only one dog, not dogs. Cerberus had 3 heads. <br />BTW - Classical Music is the same thing as today's Britney Spears. <br />&quot;Media creations for the sole purpose of inoculating the minds of ignorant youths, who obviously still haven't grown up.&quot;<br />The Beatles were media creations? In what way? Like The Monkees? Or Milli Vanilli? So someone thought up the idea of The Beatles, poured millions into promoting them, not caring if they knew how to play music or not? So Johnny and the Moondogs never existed? Or their years of touring before they were famous? Bottles of beer thrown at them in German clubs and riots were figments of the world's imagination? Or do all media creations suffer for years in obscurity before hitting the big time? Wow, I'd never want to be a media creation then. Doesn't seem like there's much profit or fame going that route.<br />Btw, you need to take some English classes. Or do you regularly skip school? <br />&quot;Media creations for the sole purpose of inoculating the minds of ignorant youths, who obviously still haven't grown up.&quot;<br />Let's break this down shall we? <br />Let's replace &quot;Media Creations&quot; with &quot;The Beatles were media creations, which exist...&quot;<br />So The Beatles are media creations who's purpose is to innoculate the minds of ignorant youth. So do you know what innoculate means? To immunize, inoculate or vaccinate. So The Beatles were created to immunize the minds of ignorant youth. Since the youth were ignorant, then the Beatles' purpose is to immunize them against ignorance. So The Beatles were created to enlighten all youth and to guard them from ignorance. In which case, you never got vaccinized and must be an ignorant youth. <br />Good day to you.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I hate fads. When I first heard about Jet, I thought &quot;Great, another neo-garage band.&quot; However, when i heard their first single on that ipod commercial, i thought i needed to look into the band. i actually bought the album without hearing any other songs when i saw it on sale for $10. it is, like porcupine tree, a great mix of alt-rock and classic-rock. my favorite song on the album is the mccartney-esque &quot;look what you've done.&quot; all of the songs have an almost overbearingly beatle-esque influence. the guitar riffs bring to mind george harrison in almost every song, it's so great. this is one band to check out.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|Ok, listen, it even took me some time to really get into the first D12 album.  I was a little disturbed by some of the Bizarre's lyrics, but I gave the whole album a chance...  Well, then I was able to pick the album up this last year at a record store that was going out of business.  Devil's night was just a compromise of tracks aimed to piss people off, more as a joke I would say.  Yet, I find every track on the album has some truth behind it.  I mean listen to the lyrics of Revelation, (intriguing to say the least).      <BR>Well, so I got a sneak peak of this album from MTV, and the singles from Napster...and let me tell you, D12World is very, very good!!  I have it ordered on amazon.com, and it will be arriving in a week or so....Can't wait :)  Best song on album \\"Get my Gun\\"  Best beat, and best lyrical arrangement by all members.  If you like hardcore rap like I do, then grab this album when it hits stores April 27.  You won't be disappointed.  <BR>(...)
B000092Q8K|4.0|While this is not Peter Gabriel's finest album, it is certainly his most accessible, with hits &quot;Sledgehammer,&quot; &quot;Big Time,&quot; &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Red Rain.&quot;  Also features a re-do of Laurie Anderson's &quot;Excellent Birds,&quot; retitled &quot;This is the Picture.&quot;  In keeping with the remastered CD collection, lyrics and photographs are included in a very nice booklet.  Also in keeping with the CD reissue, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; closes out the album, which is Gabriel's preferred order.<br />The difference in audio quality to the standard CD release is not as striking as some SACDs I've heard, but there is still enough difference to make the purchase worthwhile, especially if you haven't purchased the remastered CD version.<br />Please note that this is a stereo-only SACD, and requires a SACD-capable player.
B0001AP12G|5.0|2004-04-25
B000007MVD|4.0|This is a great album that combines the flippant humor of the Beatles with R&amp;B standards of their time and our's. Songs like &quot;Johnny B. Goode,&quot; &quot;Memphis, Tennesee,&quot; and &quot;The Hippy Hippy Shake,&quot; bring back the glory days and (then) contemporary staples of R&amp;B.  But the Beatles knew how to please their fans, singing their own &quot;I Feel Fine,&quot; &quot;Ticket to Ride,&quot; and &quot;A Hard Day's Night.&quot; The comedic asides between each song provide a little insight into the humor of the Beatles. This is a great CD to listen to, but it's hard to listen to repeatedly because of the talking in between songs. Once you've heard those once, it's more than enough.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Don't bother with the play, or the music from the play.  The original is still the best.  Nobody can fill the shoes of Sarandon, Curry, etc.  They originated the roles and have been associated with them for far too long for anyone else to come in try to change them so many years later and attempt to redo them.  Stay with the best.
B0001611DI|3.0|I think I must be the only horror movie fan in the entire world that doesn't think this movie is great.  It's okay, but it gets boring, something a zombie movie should never do, and it stays boring.  Plus, the script is trite and the acting is terrible.  <br />I know; who am I to tell George Romero what a zombie movie should or should not be?  This is probably the quintessential movie of the genre.  Well, I just don't like it very much.  It's not that entertaining.  I liked the first of the series.  The third is enjoyable in its own way.  But this one just drags on and on.  <br />I do like the allegory.  Zombies at a mall makes for good satircal social commentary.  But this only goes so far.  Some people will admit that the effects aren't that good.  Well, that is an understatement.  They are pretty bad.  I don't know exactly what their budget was, but I am surprised Tom Savini didn't do a better job.  <br />I don't think I really get Romero.  I have seen many of his critically acclaimed films and I really just don't think they are all that good.  I think he is over-rated, and so is his biggest film.
B000089RVX|5.0|After bringing home &quot;Fallen&quot; and listening to the first track, I was completely sucked in. Beautiful female vocals with great guitar riffs-- perfect combination!

B0001Z363W|5.0|Fans! I can't believe I am hearing ANY negative reviews of this album. First off...who cares if it's &quot;Black Label Society&quot; or &quot;Zakk Wylde&quot;! It's still the man and I agree with a previous review. I too am soo sick of people expecting the same album over and over and over again! What's it like to look at life through a straw?? This album is long overdue in my opinion. I think Zakk is very talented and can go heavy or subdued. Trust me people, this album is another leg in Zakk Wylde's talent novel. The more I listen, the more I like. It reminds me of Book of Shadows. I'm not gonna break it down song by song...but believe me if you are a fan, you will like it. I just get so sick of people thinking an artist should put out the album they want instead of what the artist wants. This album is very good. If you don't like it, maybe Zakk should have called you before he made it and asked for your permission to release it. Give me a friggin' break! It's a must have.
B00004XONN|5.0|When I first listened to Kid A, the first thing that came to mind was wow, this is a CD that travels from point A to point B. In all the CD's I've listened to, this is probably the best example of a comprehensive album where from track 1 on, I felt as if it moved me, one song pushing the other in the same line of direction, until I was placed out of reality, into Radiohead's world, for the duration of the album. Kid A did just that. Perhaps one of Radioheads strongest and most connective albums, Kid A is definitely a masterpiece of sound, flow, and overall commitment to one idea. From the very beginning of the album, you are placed in a different world. The bleeps, slurs, and powerful synthesizer in the beginning track, &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot;, opens up an uncanny yet powerful sound that is incredibly luring. From this sound, Kid A builds, never meandering to other strategies, up until the last almost harpsicordal ending of &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack.&quot; One of the personal highlights of the album is the great transition between &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, where after a crazy blend of climactic shredded trumpet sounds, continuing alongside the original pounding drum beat from the beginning, it crashes down into a quick orchestral sounding interlude, winding down completely into the low laying, droning and yet decisive sound of &quot;How to Disapear Completely.&quot; Even songs like &quot;Treefingers&quot; and after, &quot;Optimistic&quot;, feel so dynamic and grandiose in their bold and soothingly magnetic presence. These types of things further me to compliment the album, alongside it as a whole. <BR>In response to the overall lyrics of the album, they are most often slurred, wiggled from their origional sound, and fading. Nevertheless, the meaning of the songs and tone completely fits the idea of the album, which seems to be being obsolete and in a diffent world. <BR>The type of album Kid A represents is magnificent. It is hard to find weeknesses in the album because of its sweeping, extensive, and mystical sound. Kid A is so soothing to listen to whenever I traverse from the beginning to end. For the overall continuity and progressiveness Kid A is without a doubt 5 golden stars.
0375758992|5.0|I've been fascinated by Africa, particularly since reading Kingsolver's 'The Poisonwood Bible' several years ago, so when I saw this book and its engaging cover, I grabbed it! I just LOVED Fuller's memoir and, like so many others, just hated to see it end (but unlike others, I read it slowly, with extra maps in hand, savoring every page). It's easy to pick up any part of it and get involved all over again...<br />I was so impressed by the quality of Fuller's writing, as I'm always looking for well-written fiction (and no, this isn't fiction, but it reads like an absorbing novel). There isn't a false note in this well-crafted debut--it's so crisply honed (not an extra word anywhere!, and she knows just when to end an episode), with wonderful dialogue and vignettes, and an equally wonderful, fresh use of the English language; Fuller often uses her own original compound words, for example, to narrate her story of growing up in three African countries, with a chaotic and ever-interesting family, with Africa itself always there, always one of the characters, too.<br />I thought the story succeeded so well because Fuller doesn't 'whitewash' her parents or family at all. Nor does she judge them. While I winced at yet another drink in her mother's hand sometimes, or the fact that no one ever processed anything with young Alexandra (Bobo) after her baby sister's death, it's obvious that this is a family that has a great affection for each other, though Fuller keeps this tightly understated. I was caught up in the relationships between family members, their use of nicknames (used affectionately), the complexity of Fuller's mother--what an incredible character!--and the way Bobo seemed, to me, to be the son her father never had. And yes, these are 'racist' parents who you may not always agree with, but you love them just the same, despite their lapses (or maybe because of them).<br />I did wonder about all the alcohol and hard-drinking, which is often amusing, but sad, too, and wondered if it was central to surviving in Africa, as not only is alcohol and alcoholism a factor in Fuller's own family, but the other 'expats' seem to all get drunk, too, and so do the black Africans. Is it a way of coping with a place, a continent that seems to be, by its very nature, excessive and unpredictable?<br />I also wondered, because Fuller is yes, so amazingly candid and detailed in her portraits of the family and their life, how her parents and sister let her publish such unvarnished depictions (let's hope they're all still speaking to each other! But hats off to them all, for letting Alexandra tell it the way she saw it...).<br />Like other reviewers, I also loved learning more about this part of the world, and you do learn about the backdrop of Rhodesia's civil war (and true, you wonder why the Fullers stay--I thought there were answers in the book, though), and about the landscape and 'personality' of Africa, which are so vividly and urgently present. I also appreciated the many layers that are there to be had in this memoir--yes, it's a story of one person coming to terms with her identity, her growing up years and her family, but it also raises questions about Africa's future and the place of whites in it, to name just one thing I thought about while reading this memoir.<br />I liked the extra pieces at the end of the book ('My Africa' and suggested further reading, both of which the author adds in the paperback edition), and the many pictures from the Fuller family photos drew me in even more into Fuller's story.<br />The one thing that bothered me somewhat in the book is that I so wished Fuller had put a few more dates in; I didn't mind that she jumped around, but just wanted to know how old she was at various times, wanted to get a more accurate sense of her chronology and the family's moves (I did reread the sections in order later, but still, a few more dates would have helped, I think).<br />Hopefully, this will be a writer we'll be hearing more from. She's too good to have only this one book in her! And I'm ending this review thinking I haven't done justice to the book--it really is one of the best books I've read in ages, and I hardly ever read non-fiction anymore! If nothing else, read it for the fine, tightly beautiful writing, or for the fact that it's difficult to find a memoir that's so unsentimentally, honestly and freshly drawn.ing more from.

0515127485|4.0|In his latest novel, Harris truly makes an admirable attempt to illustrate the deep and lasting effect Communism marooned upon modern day Russian society. Archangel accurately and in great detail isolates the true origins of Communist thought and cleverly incorporates it in a successful and fast paced plot of a modern day mystery.<br /><br />Harris takes the reader on a journey into the heart of Russia, modern day Moscow, and then for a look into its soul, the far north. The reader follows an unlikely set of characters as they attempt to solve a decade old mystery involving the private writings of J.V. Stalin.<br /><br />Although the novel is generally well written, the characters come off as stereotypical. They include a pesky, obnoxious reporter, a geeky, eccentric professor, and a street hooker attending law school.<br /><br />The authors descriptive abilities are outstanding, and combined with thorough research, leave the reader just short of standing along side the characters every step of the way.<br /><br />What personally amazed me the most was the author's ability to make historical figures come to life. The lives and personalities of Stalin and his Politburo jump out at the reader, leaving a lasting impression.<br /><br />The plot, although rich in detail and historical fact, at times seems to travel off into absurd or unrealistic, which in my opinion simply makes it that much funner to read.<br />A great book for history buffs, mystery lovers, and all other Harris fans.

0345404475|4.0|A lot of people credit Gibson for the cyberpunk genre. However, you'll find many of the themes right here: alienation, our relationship to machine intelligence, the fusion of worldwide cultures, the noir-world of moral relativism.<br />This is the story that the film Bladerunner (excellent in its own right) was based on. However, it is important to realize that the film was very loosely based on it; there is one scene in the book that is virtually identical to the film, but beyond that it is quite different.<br />Unfortunately, I find that Dick can really meander towards the end of his longer works (unlike his tightly plotted short stories). Thus, I can only give it four stars. Nevertheless it is a timeless classic that will be of interest to anyone interested in what the future of man-machine interactions might hold.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|John Debney is now a film-composer favorite to many, including myself. The powerful choir and percussive strength brought out in the music is truly amazing.  What makes the ending to the film unique is the music.  It's common to end a movie with the feeling of 'this is only the beginning' (when Christ is ressurected). When the credits start to role, people in the theatre don't get up to leave. Part of the reason is that they are mopping up the tears on their face. The other reason is that the climax of the music being played is happening just as the film ends and cuts to black.  There is power in this score that moves us and keeps us through the credits.  Don't enjoy the soundtrack; feel the power and the Passion that the music brings out in you.
1594200106|4.0|When Daniel is still a child, his father takes him to the Cemetary of Forgotten Books, a mysterious labyrinthine library filled with books from well-known novels to those that have faded into obscurity. He chooses a novel called &quot;The Shadow of the Wind&quot; by Julian Carax, a writer of dark melodramas that never sold more than 100 copies. In the two decades since Carax's novels appeared in the 1920s and 1930s, they had gained a cult following in Barcelona, where Carax was raised and Daniel lives with his widowed father. Daniel vows to protect and cherish the novel so that it won't be totally forgotten.<br />Daniel soon learns that nearly all of Carax's books have been burned in mysterious fires, and a man who calls himself Lain Coubert -- the name of the devil in one of Carax's novels -- soon appears in Daniel's life and threatens him if he doesn't give Coubert his copy of &quot;The Shadow of the Wind.&quot; Daniel refuses and delves into the mysterious Julian Carax -- unwinding a story very much like one that Carax might have written: rich characters, tragedies, finding and losing love and growing up, all set within a plot of great twists and engaging writing
B00003CXCT|1.0|Having Greedo shott first completely changes the character of Han Solo; before, he was essentially a rough around the edges mercenary along with his transporting, and his personality was shown through when he had zero issues with killing Greedo, and then flipping the barkeep a coin for the 'mess', as if he's just spilled his drink.<br />And should we believe that a bounty hunter like Greedo could even miss at that range, by that much?  <br />If we had all seen Greedo shoot first, we would have had a different, unfortunately softer, view of Han.<br />That, dear Amazon reviewer, is why we care if Greedo shoots first.

0061015725|4.0|I think even a person with no knowledge in computer science and biology would enjoy this book as Crichton's explanations are simple and user-friendly, and I believe have the potential to get many readers interested in the subjects of nanotech, population biology, and distributed agent systems. <BR>After my disappointment in 'Airframe' and 'Timeline', I was more than happy to discover Crichton can still get my heart racing. I was disappointe that it ended, wanting to find out more about what happened to the main character 'Jack' and his family, or the world for that matter. Maybe there is room for 'Prey 2'. However, there were some things missing in the book. I loved the first chapters describing Jack's life and the strangeness of his wife and baby's disease, but Jack seems to skip a few really big questions, such as why the baby's room changes, the mysterious device in her room, the strange people at the accident site, why his wife didn't tell him all of his former co-workers were working with her, why she couldn't hire him herself if he was so competent and she was so upset he didn't have a job... etc. Also, without wanting to ruin it for anybody, the ending was a bit hard to imagine, science fiction and all... But the book was exremely interesting - I couldn't put the it down!

1577311523|3.0|Much of Tolle's writing in this book is clearly wise, deep and true, but it lacks balance. I think that Tolle's model of the world would make more sense, and would be more complete, if he integrated more Western ideas into his thinking. Many of Tolle's apparent \\"practical\\" methods of attaining a sound spiritual life are very impractical for most Westerners, (i.e. when they are at the office, at home with the family, or in bars with friends).<br />Tolle says that after his initial awakening, he removed himself from all worldly activities and social circles, spent his time sitting on a park bench, and relished the fact that he had \\"found what everyone else is looking for.\\" However, we are in the world for a reason, and Jesus' teachings highlighted the importance for us to get STUCK INTO the world, (\\"be a light unto the world\\"), whilst not getting attached to the world. <br />Buddhism, and Eastern wisdom is on the increase in the West because most people have understandably found little spiritual nutrients in Western religion, (i.e. in dogma and institution). But I believe that the way to attain a complete and integrated spiritual life is to merge Eastern and Western ideas, rather than exclusively embracing one or the other. <br />This book is mainly bound to an Eastern outlook, and so leaves much room for growth. Neale Donald Walsch's `Conversations With God' takes a step closer to merging East and West, and endows many of Tolle's insights with logic and structure by adhering to theistic principles, even acknowledging the `Personhood' of God.<br />I believe that we can take further steps forward to a truly enlightened model of the world by turning full circle, returning to our Christian roots, (with the fruits of Eastern wisdom under our belt), and acknowledging that words such as \\"Being\\", \\"Infinite\\", or \\"Greater Reality\\", are actually referring to our Father in Heaven, who knows each of us personally, and who created the Heavens and earth intentionally. <br />I've found that the most enlightening and `chord-striking' model of the world can be found in Michael Newton's book, `Destiny of Souls', and Sylvia Browne's `Life on the Other Side', which I recommend.<br />For me personally, my spiritual life became complete when I acknowledged God as &quot;Jesus&quot; again. (Christianity affirms that a child-like faith is all we need to understand the Truth.)

0385512104|5.0|Prior to purchasing this novel, I had read several reviews, all positive.  Even Stephen King recommended this book in his &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; column.  So, I knew going in that &quot;The Curious Incident...&quot; was written from the viewpoint of an autistic person, and that most people thought it to be a great book.  Nothing, however, prepared me for just how shockingly authentic was the narrator's point of view.  I expected to be impressed by some literary tricks, but what I discovered was a distinctly real, compassionate character who, like everyone, faces limitations in communicating emotion and understanding others.  What impressed me most was the character's forthright honesty.  Upon finishing this remarkable book, I gained the insight that the reason it is easier for &quot;non-autistic&quot; persons to function in this society is not due to a gift of human connection, but rather it's because of our ability to constantly weave and fabricate falsities and untruths. I wholeheartedly recommend this book.  You'll learn a little about autistism, but you will learn much more about society.
B000050FEN|5.0|Seven is far superior to Silence of the Lambs and comparisons should only be left at the commonality of the villans being serial killers.  This is such a compelling and frightening (don't expect to sleep after viewing) movie that I have seen it only once (VHS rental - pre-DVD era), and have no need to purchase a copy. It is a supurbly acted terror flick, but years from now, if I really feel the need to see it again, I'll just rent it. This opinion is from someone who's not a huge fan of this type of movie and it has left a very lasting impression of what an excellent spine-tingling terror flick is.  It is a standard by which to judge all others.
B00005MAM2|4.0|Highlights: Astounding animation with a few unforgettable trippy sequences; uncompromising dynamism; characteristically complicated-but-involving anime plot.<BR> Lowpoints: The dubbed version contains laughably bad translation; infinite running time; repetitive at times.<br /> Conclusion: True anime fans will savor every minute of ?Akira?, directed by the legendary Katsuhiro Otomo, relinquishing themselves to the emblematic anime plot. Those, who are familiar with several anime features, but aren?t genre geeks, will marvel at the futuristic animation and get mildly caught up in the convoluted narrative, as well as squirm at the explicit carnage. Others should be aware that this one is NOT for the kids, OR fans of solely Walt Disney productions, who will most probably get irritated at the atypical structure of the plot and horrified by the extreme gratuitous gore. An alternative classic amongst genre aficionados.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Iron Madien was great!

B00006ADFL|5.0|\\"Heavenly Creatures\\" is a little known movie from New Zealand directed by Peter Jackson(director of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy) and starring Kate Winslet(actress from acclaimed 1997 film \\"Titanic\\"). The film is a true story about two girls living in the 1950s in New Zealand. The girls both have wonderful imaginations. They dream and write of knights, kings, and princesses. But after a while the girls become more than just friends. Their parents believe that it is not healthy to love a friend of the same sex in that way or form. It is at this point that the girls plan a scheme that will scar them for the rest of their lives.<BR> The film will be considered disturbing to just about everybody (unless of course you are an active member of the Manson family) so if easily shooken the film is not meant for you. But every one else should check this flick out!
B00000DSEK|5.0|This album is easily by far the greatest album Ozzy Osbourne has ever recorded. Unfortuanely &quot;No More Tears&quot; won't get the acclaim as say &quot;The Blizzard of Oz&quot; being that heavy metal was losing steam when this album was released.&quot;No More Tears&quot; features Zakk Wylde on guitars, Robert Trujillo on bass, the late Randy Cadtillo on drums, and of course Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. Excellent songs such as No more Tears,Hellraiser, and Road to Nowhere make this album a no brainer to own for any Ozzy fan.

I like tracks 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10, everything but 9. 9's okay actually. my fave track is Toxic, I think it should be the theme song for a James Bond movie, or at least the music (everything but the singing) the violins are really cool. I also have the Oops... cd, and the Britney cd and the In The Zone cd, of course. great... now Showdown is stuck in my head. oh, I forgot to mention, these songs get stuck in your head VERY easily. at least with me.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Anyone labeling this album &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;pretencious&quot; is totaly to wrapped up in their own self image to see how beutiful it is (don't beleive me? ask Beck!)<br />The song that'll totally get you hooked is paper tiger. The strings and drums funk out emotion and his muttering melody will haunt you to the bone. The lyrics, like all lyrics on this album, are dark and sad and classic, and yet not cliche! HOORAY!<br />The best part is how much Beck has progresed since his last album. Without a trace of what made us love Beck before; it's still just as good. Beck will never get old and hasn't made a bad album yet!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!!!!!<br />After buying this album, buy one foot in the grave, then Stereopathetic soulmanure, then Mellow Gold, then Odelay, then Mutations then Midnight Vultures!!!!!!!!!!! I DID!!!!!!!!!!

B00006L83N|2.0|...but they still need to mature a bit. Or at least, get a good producer.Three problems with this album.1)...At times the vocals are a little pitchy. I can't believe they let that slide.2)...It's too long -- as was &quot;V&quot;, but that was a near masterpiece.  Still. some editing wouldn't have hurt. Half way through the songs started sounding very similar. 3)...(And this is the big one). Romeo's guitar is mixed so far above everyone in the band it's ridiculous. It's as if he was afraid you might not hear EVERY note he played.      We get it Mike. You're good. You're fast.  But the rest of the band ain't no slouches either and music is a collaboration of ideas and sounds. And there should have been enough faith in the songs to let them sink or swim on their own. Even though I felt that &quot;V&quot; had too much low end on the guitar (covering the bass), on this album he goes completely overboard and it  comes off like an ego driven solo project where the band is there just to provide a showcase for the guitar. That was Malmsteens downfall. He couldn't let go of the spotlight. But when you're good, people notice. If you FORCE them to notice, they turn away. And that was my reaction to this album. Too bad. I'm an old school prog rock guy and I felt this was the most exciting band to come along in  years. Sadly, they dropped the ball with this release. (Although there are a few good moments). But I still have faith. The talent is there.
B000001IPL|5.0|I'm not usually compelled to write reviews, even for other albums that I think deserve a 5 STAR rating. However, &quot;Smash&quot; is one of the greatest albums from the 90's. Their later material makes me vomit and just depresses me to think that it's the same Offspring. Dexter was a voice for grunge kids in the early 90's, now he's a horrible parody of his former self. The entire band went down hill and will never reach the status of this album, again.<br />This a classic album and I hope to God it's never forgotten.
0609610570|5.0|An excellent book that provide very useful advice on delivering result, or as the title suggested, \\"Getting things done\\".     Personally, I think the authors suggestion, both the concept and method suggested, is very good. From my personal experience, because of reading this book, I notice some areas that I need to improve at my dapartment and when I apply the concept mentioned, it \\"work\\" as desired. It produce positive result. I believe i would not be the only one who can benefits from this excellent book, that's why i write a review here, and i highly recomment this book.     May be this excerpt from the book can largely express my feel regard this book:   \\"There is so much pressure on people to perform that nice round words become a luxury you can't afford anymore\\"     For me, this a book that offer you candor, robust, and practical advice that directly link with how to get things done, and get desired result.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|This is a nice film of the \\"chick flick\\" variety.  You'll rent it with your girlfriend(s) because you are a fan of Keanu, Jack and/or Diane, because it's a feel-good movie movie and because you have no idea what else to get at the video store.  You will pass a mild evening on the couch with a few giggles and popcorn.<br />Diane Keaton plays accomplished 50 something woman Erica Barry whose grown daughter Marin (Amanda Peet) is dating notorious 60 something bachelor Harry Sandborn (Jack Nicholson).  After a rocky introduction at the family's beach house, Erica and Harry are in a continual state of hostility that in the movies can only mean sexual tension.  Erica is of course idealistically outraged that such an older man is dating her daughter.  The two of them trade snipes and pot shots.  Inevitably, the odd couple are thrown together alone for a few days while Harry recovers from a heart attack.  Harry is impressed with Erica's spirit and intelligence while Erica grudgingly notices that Harry has moments of irrepressible charm.  But now it seems that a love triangle is being set up as his doctor (Keanu Reeves) has ironically started to fall for the much-older Erica.  How will this mess get ironed out?  Hmmmmm.<br />If you're thinking the plot sounds a bit predictable, you'd be right.  The pacing is also a bit slow, the dvd had flaws in its color consistency and there was a general lack of things that would appeal to men in this movie.  Jack and Diane hammed it up a little too much at times.  At the end, I said to myself, \\"that was nice\\", but promptly forgot about it; not a sign of provocative, cutting edge screenswriting to be sure.<br />I do have to give this movie its props; not many have ever tried to tackle the May/December romance syndrome that is everywhere in Hollywood (which is a particular pet peeve of mine, I might add).  Also, while the performances by the leads were over the top, these stars did make a nice pair with a good chemistry.  There were also some very girly giggly moments.  So it would seem that there is a place for Something's Gotta Give on the shelf of my favorite local video store...just not on the shelf of my home library.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle
B0001BKAEY|1.0|OH MY GOD!!!!<br />This movie sucks so hard, it makes Dude Where Is My Car seem like Lord Of The Rings!!!!!<br />It has a stupid scenario, one that you have,to more or less, get from the start or else you are dead meat and you don't even know it, it's a really bad idea if you wanna just see something and relax, Reeves playing Neo as if he is a robot, and by the first 20 minutes you wish you had rented Star Wars or Lord Of The Rings and not bought this crap, and above all, everything seems to be so important and all keep thinking through the movie is &quot;What the f**k are they doing there?&quot;<br />The bad news is that they are thinking about a second trilogy (WHY??? WHY????)<br />The good news is that compared to this all other movies are masterpieces!! <BR>Well done people, next time you should aim in making a movie that's better than Scooby Doo!!!!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Finally a good made movie, and not trash that runs in theaters nowadays such as Swat or Fast and Furious. This movie is like a movie should be, spontanous, character development etc...<br />I cant see why some people are turned off by the dialogues and the music. Crowe did another masterful job in portraying a real hero, who is able to admit mistakes. If you cant pay attention more than 5 mins this movie is not for you.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Ok, so anyone who wishes to call themselves a cinefan is familiar with Quentin Tarantino's movies. And everyone awaited so long for his next big movie.<BR>And that's it.<br />Kill Bill has a simple but yet complicated, at the same time, scenario.<BR>It's about a woman, with the code name &quot;Black Mamba&quot; (Uma Thurman) who used to be an assasin, and a high-class member of an organized assasins' team (whose leader was Bill), but decided to leave them , so that she could get married and lead a normal life. Of course, that was out of the question for Bill, who sent her former colleagues and friends, in her wedding, to destroy her marriage and kill her. She is pregnant at the time of her marriage to Bill's child. <BR>  After the assasination of the whole church, she manages to survive out of plain luck. She remains in coma for a long long<BR>time and then... she wakes up, ready to take revenge for her colleagues almost-lethal &quot;visit&quot; in her marriage, that costed her her child. So she practices just so that she can destroy them and of course... KILL BILL.<br />  Kill Bill is not an ordinary movie (after all, Quentin's movies are all about surprises!). It's a mixture of Japanese kung-fu movies (that Tarantino adores) with the American adventure movie style.It's story is more or less, a liberating action : REVENGE!!<BR>  The direction is awsome.you won't get bored watching the movie ,no matter what. The music is great (in my country Kill Bill's soundtrack has sold more that 150,000 copies) and Uma Thurman is lethaly beautigul (and I mean that literally)<br />  See the movie. As I am writing these lines Kill Bill Vol. 2 has already hit the movie theaters and is going really well, both ticket and critic wise.<BR>  <BR>  A MUST SEE
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Listening, and re-listening, to the Concert for George has been meaningful to me.  I'm a few years shy of forty, so was not around for Beatle mania,  but have always been a fan of the Beatles, and George Harrison was always my favorite solo Beatle artist.  I own every album he made, and even a bootleg or two.  While I am not Hindu, I appreciate his quest for God and meaning.  And while his solo work is uneven in quality, a listen to all of his albums in a row still leaves me impressed with his ability and talent.  I miss him.<br /><br />Concert for George is an excellent tribute to George Harrison, bringing to me his most remembered music.  One highlight is \\"Something\\", done by Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton.  It is one of the few times I have heard a Beatle song  done in a different way without it being diminished.  I also loved hearing the Traveling Wilburys, (most of the survivors, but with Dani Harrison and without Bob Dylan) sing \\"Handle with Care\\".  A personal highlight  was listening to \\"I need you\\", which I had not paid that much attention to before.  I did not purchase Songs from the Material World: A Tribute to George Harrison as I had all of the original music and did not think that it overall improved on the songs I love.  Concert for George is different.  It adds to George Harrison's music without detracting from it.<br /><br />If  there is any weakness to the album, it is only my personal choices as to what was George Harrison's best music.  Concert for George,  like the Live in Japan album, does not include anything from 33 & 1/3, which not counting All Things Must Pass was arguably his best album of the 1970s  \\"This Song\\", \\"Crackerbox Palace\\"  \\"Woman Don't Cry for Me\\", or especially the lovely \\"Beautiful Girl\\" would have made excellent contributions to the memorial album.  Instead, we are treated to a likable version of  \\"That's the Way it Goes\\", from one of George's weakest albums, Gone Troppo. To me, it is obvious that the song does not represent George's best, and its inclusion among his other work shows this.<br /><br />Probably the other critique I'd make is might arouse controversy.  It was wonderful to see both Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr on stage together. Paul adds by being understated throughout the evening, but I'm not sure Ringo adds much.  I have been listening to his All-Starr albums since the early 1990s, and he  usually sings  the same material on each. ironicaly  after years of this,  it seems that what now makes an All-Starr album interesting is not Ringo, but rather his guest stars.  Relying on his rather limited musical talent, he sings two All-Starr standards \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Honey Don't\\".  They both really don't have very much to do with George, and Ringo is the only one who has to explain his songs before he sings them, so they fit in context with the rest of the music.<br /><br />The critiques aside, I recommend this album.  It succeeds in paying tribute to a musician with a deeper side who kept his quest for God foremost, and who didn't sell out to try and sell albums.  I appreciate Eric Clapton and George's other friends for giving George, and his fans, a remarkable evening.t, and its inclusion among his other work shows this.

B00018TI5E|5.0|Sooner or later, every artist faces the dilemma of having to choose between popularity and artistic integrity. John Frusciante chose both. On &quot;Shadows collide with people&quot;  he follows the same path as on the recent Red Hot Chili Peppers albums, writing catchy tunes and adding his deeper-going, multi-dimensional touch.<br />&quot;Carvel&quot; opens the album with eerie synth sounds leading into what seems to be a conventional pop song. However, the variety of sounds, themes and vocals John uses here is simply astonishing. &quot;Omission&quot; features co-songwriter Josh Klinghoffer on vocals. The interplay of the voices is just beautiful to hear. On &quot;Ricky&quot; and &quot;Second Walk&quot; John shares his newly-won life philosophy : &quot;Be who you are, do what you do, not win or lose&quot;. &quot;Every Person&quot; and &quot;Wednesday's Song&quot; manage to be catchy and deep at the same time. <br />The highlights of the album  are undoubtedly the last few songs beginning with &quot;In Relief&quot;. Especially &quot;Water&quot; takes you to almost every station of John's musical career: the funky riff, the falsetto vocals, the somber yet joyous solo ot the end. &quot;The Slaughter&quot; is one of my favorite songs ever written by John.<br />All in all, &quot;Shadows&quot; is definitely John's most polished solo album yet, which doesn't prevent it from being as groundbreaking. Now he's proved he can work with conventional methods and still emerge with something fresh and new. Even the use of 60's harmonies and synths serves as a trampoline to the future. Which, according to John Frusciante, is very promising. This is the first Frusciante album with a clear positive and optimistic message, he stands up for everything he's gone through and thanks life for the experiences that made him who he is now.<br />This is the sequel of the story about the man who's won a life's struggle. John Frusciante is the I-narrator.
B000000W5H|4.0|First things first. To start with, there are three songs that do not belong here. &quot;Time Waits For No One&quot; (which drags on WAY too long, despite a fine guitar solo from Mick Taylor), &quot;Short And Curlies&quot; (a throwaway), and an anemic cover of &quot;Ain't Too Proud To Beg&quot; that simply cannot hold a candle to the Temptations' original.<br />Having said that, what remains is primo Stones indeed. The opening track, &quot;If You Can't Rock Me&quot; kicks things off with swagger and style. &quot;Till The Next Goodbye&quot; and &quot;If You Really Want To Be My Friend&quot; are two of their finest ballads. The title track, despite years of heavy airplay, still holds up well and remains one of the greatest descriptions of the performing life. &quot;Luxury&quot; is (along with &quot;Hot Stuff&quot;) their best stab at reggae (and good to hear the full five-minute version; the original vinyl chopped off 30 seconds due to time constraints). &quot;Dance Little Sister&quot; is one of their nastiest, greasiest rockers and ranks with classics such as &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash&quot;. And just to prove the veteran rockers still had a few tricks up their sleeves, they proceed to invent white funk with &quot;Fingerprint File&quot;, a full three years before the Talking Heads. While this album is not quite the masterpiece of an Exile or Beggars or Sticky Fingers it's still a worthy addition to your Stones collection. In fact, I'm playing it right now....
B00005JKJA|5.0|I'm not a Lynch's fan because Mulholland Drive is the first and only film I've ever watched from him, so I hope this can be considered an impartial comment. This movie is PURE ART! It moves your deepest emotions completely, including fear, jealousy, sadnes, intrigue, hate and (a little) love with great picture and awsome dialogs, music is sometimes an important element too. However in my experience, the process of appreciating this movie was slow. The first time I watched Mulholland Drive, in the movie theater, it ended and all I had in my mind was a big question mark. What was this all about??!! However I did not dislike it and months later I gave it a second chance, on DVD, and this time I was shocked. This big question mark inside my head became many small question marks and, after watching it several times, many of them are still there. But that is one of the things that makes Mulholland Drive so GREAT, it's complexity and the enigmas that remain open and may be answered in so many ways. It is also full of symbolic elements that would have no sense if you watch it like any traditional movie, their meanings, however, are not cleared during the movie, you'll have to discover them yourself and it's not easy to do it. That's why I'd say this one is for intelligent watchers only. I'll not describe the story because you'll find it in other comments, but I think this is for people looking for an emotional-artistic experience, and not for people who want an &quot;interesting story&quot;. If you like the kind of movies that stays away from conventional Hollywood trash; if you enjoyed, for example, Memento or PI, then this is the next one you MUST watch.
B0000CFW87|1.0|Josh Groban is nothing but Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion rolled into one. He looks like he belongs in a Gap commercial.   <br />There is some psychology happening here. Since Mr. Groban has a certain look, people will say that he has an excellent voice and that his singing is heartfelt. If he didn't have \\"the look\\", then he'd be seen for what he is, namely a Bocelli clone with no true creativity or musical talent. <br />Come on, people! Wise up, huh?
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|Really a superb album. It does not exist there of enough strong word to describe the beauty of this album. As Cline said at the time of her concert In France:&quot;the more beautiful language to sing the love is French&quot; This album 100 % French proves it.  <BR>Celine Dion who goes down from Hugues Capet, King of France (like George W Bush but of him one of tappe), is the ambassadress of the French language in the world. Highly the next album in French from Celine.

1592400876|5.0|There is precious little I can add to the excellent previous reviews that would illuminate this highly recommended volume other than stating that there should be some commentary made vis a vis the lack of punctuation in this sentence that would have been remedied had this sentence been an example used in the book to which I refer.<br />Anyway, if you find yourself irate when seeing various ignorant punctuation transgressions,  this book will allow you to chuckle and nod knowingly for a few hours.  The text of the book is identical to the English version;  there is a new preface and introduction.  I assume this is because most Americans no longer speak English,  and certainly can't write it,  if standarized test results are indicative of our skills.<br />I don't (contraction of \\"do not\\") think that anyone has mentioned the humor of the book's cover.  This cover is,  perhaps,  the best example of graphic design coupled with packaged content I can recall.  A panda is on a ladder,  blotting out the apostrophe; a second panda,  upright and exiting,  holds a gun.  Get it?<br />No?
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park is talented, but they don't tend to use all their talent on this album, it's a great album though. The only problem is that it sounds a little too much like Hybrid Theory to be groundbreaking like HT was. Some songs do sound like they tried to create tracks to be like In The End, like Somewhere I Belong, and as i like to call it, Crawling pt. 2, Easier To Run. a few songs stood out like Lying From You, Session was softer and seemed more professional the Cure for the Itch, and of course my favorite Breaking The Habit. Breaking The Habit has single written all over it, and looks like it will be the last single for Meteora, it's not as good as In The End but it is damn close, at least that's what i think. this is only their sophomore effort so the albums flaws are hardly a problem. Great Album anyways
B0001L3MI0|5.0|First,I was surprised when I came to the page for the Limited Edition with the free movie ticket, to find that almost all the ads were 1-star ratings.  (...)  Films are escapist, do I need to mention that?  This is an American film, displaying a rare air of American Patriotism in modern cinema.  It has plenty of cliches, it has its silly moments, but it is also a great film to cheer the heroes.  And yes, the heroes are Americans, because if the French made a movie similar to this, the heroes would have been French and if the Australians had made a similar movie... if you're not too dense you get my point.  I loved the movie because I liked many of the characters.  I liked their stories, their sacrifices, and their joys in the face of impending doom.  I do agree with some of the critics who pan the film that say it is like a B-movie from the old days.  I agree, it has those aspects married to some modern special effects.  To me, it works well.  If you don't hate America or if you don't think being American is an embarassment, you just may enjoy this movie.
B000066NW0|3.0|the first time i listened to this album, is sounded great, but then i listened to it 30 more times, the album has some flaws and a few errors, the singing sounds like it was recorded all in one take, except for I'm With You, that was a good track, songs like Unwanted and Nobodys Fool sound like songs to keep the album above 40 minutes, the rapping made my ears bleed, it was horrible, but now too her talents, she is a great writer very mature lyrics for her age, 17 at the time. A so-so guitar player, not all her talent went into it in the album, even though she only plays for a couple songs, the guitar and bass seemed lacking in a couple ways. Skater Boi was a mediocre song, maybe because it was played way too many times. But she is talented, and does show a lot of heart into was she does, and that's basically all that counts.
B00005LQ04|5.0|Suspiria is not only one of the greatest Italian horror movies of all time, but one of the greats of horror, full stop. For years, the British censors cut material from this film which they deemed as being offensive. Fortunately, they have had a change of heart over the past few years and are now allowing movies previously too controversial to now be released. Suspiria is one of them. I won't reveal the scenes which were cut as it might spoil your first time viewing, but if you want to watch some good horror that doesn't have any of the typical 'masked killer stalks good-looking teenager' which dominates the modern horror movies then Suspiria will provide you the frights.
B000002JSP|5.0|I've often heard this album criticized for being non-Zeppelin-like in years past; as if they were not being true to themselves. \\"In through the out door\\" features liberal use of synthesizers in addition to explorations in latin, disco, and country. To some, these musical explorations may have given the impression of a band, sometimes credited for ushering in \\"heavy metal\\" (a historical label more appropriately applied to Black Sabbath, in my view) as selling out to a more tempered, if not 'commercial,' sound.   In the final analysis, the latter criticisms turn out to be incorrect. As a band, Zeppelin were only continuing to mature. 'Heavy metal' riffs a la' Whole Lotta Love\\" or \\"Immigrant song\\" are replaced in favor of songs where the guitar riff is less prominent, only to be more eloquently interwoven into the musical arrangement (listen to \\"In the evening,\\" \\"Carouselambra,\\" or \\"All my love\\"). The addition of synthesizers was probably the unpardonable sin for some Zep fans, but when looking back, the album is not any more diverse than the eclectic collections of songs found on \\"Houses of the Holy,\\" \\"III,\\" or any Zep album.   On 'Out door,' Page devotes more time to refining the art of accompaniment than in years past--playing more 'for the song.' The latter 'minimal' approach foreshadowed what he would continue to develop in years to come with The Firm and other projects. Its still the same great Jimmy, minus the extravegant cadenzas. Left standing are what matters most: Great musicainship tightly integrated into a band context.  However, if there are any 'stellar' solos on the album comparable to the early days, it would have to be the blistering, melodic lead on \\"Fool in the Rain.\\"   Though the overall sound is a bit \\"softer\\" than the earlier Zep, this album is still a rocker (it's Led Zeppelin, how can it not be?).You can't say that \\"Fool in the rain\\" or \\"South bound saurez\\" don't move the body as much as the spirit, or that songs like \\"All my love\\" or \\"I'm gonna crawl\\" aren't as hard-hitting emotionally as \\"Whole lotta love\\" or \\"Dazed and Confused\\" were as sonic textures.   Today, this album is testament to the fact that the band were able to absorb new influences without dilluting the essential elements of their sound, just as they had always done. \\"In through the out door,\\" taken in conjunction with the Knebworth footage (their last live performance), reveals that Zeppelin were entering into yet another creative phase, cut short by Bonham's untimely departure.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|I'm hoping one of you music lovers out there could help me.<br />I'm after the name of the track that plays in the background of the menu (and the bill/sophie intro) of the Kill Bill 2 flash website @ [...] <BR>I don't think its on the soundtrack but the track is hauntingly beautiful.<br />Thanks in advance.
6302801249|5.0|I really love the movie &quot;The big blue&quot;,and the ending gives me some deep feelings about the big blue sea.I come from a easten country,so I can't absolutely understand the meaning of the sea to the westerners.In my opinion,it may be perfect pureness and freedom.After all,Jacques' innocent blue eyes gives me such an idea.We have limited by our advanced civilizations for long,maybe we are tired.But how can we escape from the cages made by ourselves?Perhaps,go into the deep sea.Of course,if we do so,we are killing ourselves at the same time.That's what Jacques did.Leaving the real world behind,searching for original love from the pure blue is the most suitable ending for the movie.I think I love this ending.It's a fairy tale not giving you simple happiness,but a way to hold a relationship to your original life ,though it seems a liitle sad.
B00009V7RF|5.0|This is an absolute must buy and must have for anyone looking for some real good new music. I originally bought this CD for &quot;Hey Mama&quot;, of course, is one of the best songs on the CD, but the other songs included did not leave me flat, in fact this CD left me wanting more.I would definitely recommend looking into and listening to BEP, this is a group to watch and really enjoy.
B000002UB3|5.0|I wish every band would produce an ending album like this one.  As a reviewer said earlier, the best thing about the Beatles is their growth as a band throughout their run together.  When they felt the growing come to a stop, they broke up.<br />I see the medley on the second side partly as a summary of their career.  In &quot;You never give me your money,&quot; the first part talks about &quot;that magic feeling: Nowhere to go.&quot;  This is how I think John or Paul must have felt before the band formed.  Then the &quot;One sweet dream&quot; would be the formation of the band and its rise in popularity.  In Golden Slumbers, there is no growth left for the Beatles &quot;Once there was a way to get back home,&quot; but now the band feels it is time to move on.  Paul tells us to &quot;Sleep pretty darling do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby,&quot; I think meaning that we will always have their music.  &quot;The End&quot; is a solid song, especially the final lyric, &quot;And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make.&quot;  However, the Beatles cannot end their career in such a seemingly fitting way.  Paul sings us one more &quot;lullaby&quot; with the track &quot;Her Majesty&quot; coming 18 seconds after the previous song.
B00005JM02|5.0|Why 'Finding Nemo' got some bad press at the time of its cinematic release will forever more puzzle me. It's a wonderful, glorious romp through the Garden of Disney, and has more going for it than most of Disney's recent releases.<br />Nemo is a young clown fish, who, after his mother and siblings were killed by a predatory fish, is left to the care of his overprotective father Marlin. When Nemo is captured by human divers, Marlin must brave the entire ocean and his own boundaries to rescue his only son, helped along the way by the forgetful Dory and a whole host of memorable characters.<br />Disney's computer animation just keeps on getting better and better; parts of this movie look so real that it's impossible not to sit up and take notice. I will always be a bigger fan of hand-drawn cartoons, but kudos to the designers and animators, they have given us a world of believable depth and mind-blowing detail. <br />The voiceovers are of the ususal excellent standard, with Ellen DeGeneres (Dory) and John Ratzenberger in a cameo (Fish School) being among some of the best, most endearing voiceover parts I have ever heard. Albert Brooks does a decent job with the character of Marlin, ditto Alexander Gould as Nemo, and the impression left on the viewer by their talent is one of character depth and attachment.<br />The storyline may be standard Disney fare, but it's excellent, intelligent little touches like the Seagulls in Sydney (Mate! Mate! Mate!) and the Fish-Not-Food Sharks that make 'Finding Nemo' stand head and shoulders above such other standard Disney fare as 'Brother Bear' and 'Mulan'. Coupled with such magnificent visuals and excellent, credible voice acting, 'Nemo' is a highly polished package both for adults and kids alike.<br />'Finding Nemo', really, is something you shouldn't be without. It's fantastic!
B00001OH7G|5.0|Previous reviewers have done a very good job with their high praise of this masterpiece, but there are two things I would like to share with anyone who might be tempted but not yet convinced to add this gem to their collection.    First, the blistering, full length Walk On Hot Coals featured on this disc is perhaps Rory and his bandmates at their finest.  That cut alone is worth the price of the CD.    Second, this cd is a wonderful complement to, not a substitute for, Rory's Irish Tour 74 DVD.  Although there is some overlap in the song titles, there is no overlap in the performances.  (I really liked the DVD, and almost didn't buy the CD because I thought it would contain mostly the same perfomances.  It would be a shame for anyone to make that mistake.)    Many thanks to Rory and the boys for these superb performances.
B00009V7RF|1.0|This album is just garbage they messed up for real by throwin ol girl in there, tha songs are mad annoying.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I waited until all 5 singles were released and then I bought it after seeing a majority of the singles had a positive message in them. She has a couple of raunchy songs (Dirrty, Get Mine Get Yours) but other than that this song is an absolute MUST HAVE. Christina really patterns herself after Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. Let's hope she can keep her good voice longer than they've kept there's because she has the quality of both of their voices. I can't wait for her next studio release!<br />But contrary to popular belief though Christina is not a Coloratura Soprano like Mariah is. Christina is a Spinto Soprano and thus has a lower range. Her highest note is G6 (SNL What a Girl Wants) In her live performances she'll normally sing up to C6; NOT C7 as is said somewhere on this website. A Coloratura Soprano like Mariah can sing up to A6 or higher.
B0001HLVSC|1.0|Okay, okay I know there are fans of this movie that will want to make me walk the plank for this review...BUT...... I was unable to get interested in this movie in the least !!!!!<br />I tried twice to sit down and watch this movie but each time my mind wandered to other things. The movie simply did not grab my interest or attention in the least.<br />Naval battle.... get drunk and eat... naval battle... get drunk and eat... that got old real fast.<br />I found myself grabbing magazines to read and other things to distract me while this movie played.<br />The second time I turned to my wife and asked... \\"Do you mind if I stop this movie ?\\"<br />Her reply.... \\"Go ahead. I'm not watching it anyway. I fell asleep first time and this time I'm doing needlepoint. This film is lame and boring.\\"<br />So we never made it past about 50 minutes before just giving in to pure boredom and the mental torture of dragging thru this bloated artsy-fartsy film.<br />Great cinematography... great costumes.... great historical accuracy... but if I want a documentary I'll watch History Channel and actually enjoy a real history lesson.... not Hollywood's attempt at being cerebral or whatever.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I have been reading reviews of this CD being a disappointment becuase the US version is missing some tracks from the UK version, or a few have been altered. For example, Maroon 5 is no longer a full cut of Sweetest Goodbye, but now it's a joining of two songs, and this US version has the original Pointer Sisters version of Jump, unlike the UK version which has the new Girls Aloud edition. Both are great, but I feel I should just warn some unsuspecting others. Another difference which is effective on both additions is the Lynden David Hall version of 'All You Need Is Love'. This is a disappointingly dull song with an appaling beat, that doesn't compare to the version in the film and its trailer. <BR>Despite the US version's flaws, Love Actually is an excellent CD soundtrack that hands a lot more respectful reputation to the brilliant film. Unlike the US version, the UK soundtrack has two more of the instrumentals. In addition the UK gets the beautiful PM's and Portuguese Love Themes. It also gets the same treatment as the US soundtrack, but in different track order. The UK soundtrack has got the instrumentals last on the CD, whereas the three Christmas songs not displayed on the Amazon.com page are placed in different areas of the CD, and so are more smoothly spaced out. <BR>Those three are all excellent covers. Otis Redding does a surprisingly good rendition of 'White Christmas', Billy Mack's 'Love Is All Around' is hilarious, but lacks the backing vocals of the Motown singers featured at the start of the film, and Olivia Olson's 'All I Want For Christmas Is You' is fantastic. The second best song on the CD, just behind Kelly Clarkson's 'Trouble With Love', but definitely the best cover. She has just such an incredible voice for such a young age, and at times can just make you not care about the other tracks! IT'S BRILLIANT!!! <BR>My song preferences rank like this: <BR>1. Kelly Clarkson - Trouble With Love Is <BR>2. Olivia Olson - All I Want For Christmas Is You <BR>3. Beach Boys - God Only Knows <BR>4. Billy Mack - Christmas Is All Around <BR>5. The Calling - Wherever You Will Go <BR>6. Girls Aloud - Jump (For My Love) <BR>7. Maroon 5 - Sweetest Goodbye <BR>8. Otis Redding - White Christmas <BR>9. Dido - Here With Me <BR>10. Norah Jones - Turn Me On <BR>11. Sugababes - Too Lost In You <BR>12. Lynden David Hall - All You Need Is Love <BR>13. Gabrielle - Sometimes <BR>14. Eva Cassidy - Songbird <BR>15. Joni Mitchell - Both Sides Now <BR>16. Texas - I'll See It Through <BR>17. Wyclef Jean - Take Me As I Am <br />My instrumental preferences rank like this: <BR>1. PM's <BR>2. Glasgow's <BR>3. Portuguese
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I've recently discovered this little-known UK band, Muse, and I'm blown away by almost every aspect of this release. The music is heavy alternative, but with a production and songwriting expertise that takes it all to a new area of exploration. The band's driving force is classically oriented progressions played by guitars, pianos, drums, and more guitars. All the while, Matt Bellamy bellows his amazing melodic impressions over the whole thing. <br />Straight away, something needs to be addressed. This band and its singer, despite the nitpicking disclaimers other reviewers have tried to make, sounds remarkably similar to old Radiohead (The Bends, OK Computer in particular). Matt Bellamy, in fact, could be a stand-in on any Radiohead tour. I actually did research to see of Bellamy was really Thom Yorke masquerading in a front band. That's how much they sound alike, bottom line. You can try to compare and contrast abstract and subtle approaches to style that differ, but the reality is if someone would've told me this was an unreleased Radiohead record from 1997, I would've believed them, no questions asked. <br />However, this isn't an entirely fair comparison. I also would've said of this fictional 1997 Radiohead release, &quot;Wow, Thom's singing range has really expanded...and the music's gotten far more complex...and the production is more intense and intelligent than other Radiohead records...&quot; <br />That all means that Absolution actually blows by any early Radiohead comparisons that others would make. So what if Matt Bellamy sounds just like Thom Yorke? He sounds *better* than Tom Yorke. So what if the chord progressions are similar to OK Computer's monolithic vamp sections? Absolution's are far more accessible and integrated into the songs, rather than treated as special musical bridges (as in OK Computer). Bottom line there? They do Radiohead better than Radiohead, especially now, while Thom and the boys are off experimenting with German euro-trash techno, the stuff that Aphex Twin has been doing better than them for years. <br />This is also an unfair comparison because Muse incorporates a far greater span of influence into their music than Radiohead (or any modern band trying to do this). I hear tons of Queen in their music, as well as hints of ELO, especially in the vocal arrangements. It's also evident that Bellamy has spent some time with the classical composers - Rachmaninoff, Puccini, Chopin for example. Their melodies permeate his writing - and I love every minute of it.<br />The songs are all astounding. The melodies are haunting, the production fresh and very unique. My only complaint is that the sonics aren't particularly good. There are times where the mix is so huge and distorted that it's hard to even pick out what they are trying to do. At the same time, music like this sort of needs that to sound &quot;right.&quot; These same songs recorded in pristine settings would probably sound far more stale than the raw genius portrayed on Absolution.<br />Also recommended if you like this: Jump Little Children &quot;Vertigo&quot; and Sigur Ros &quot;()&quot;
B000002LND|5.0|There is nothing that I or any other Madonna fan in the world(which are a lot of people)would want more than to have all of Madonna's hits from her true golden era.This compilation really proves that Madonna is one of the greatest entertainers in history,and can really pull the transformation thing off.From the radio-friendly pop hits &quot;Material Girl&quot; and &quot;Borderline&quot; to the controversial classics &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;,this album is any fan's dream and might even attract some new ones,even to this day.The one thing about this album that makes it amazing is that it will attract new listeners for generations to come.I mean,it even worked on me,and I used to hate Madonna!
B0001I55OC|3.0|&quot; Timeline&quot; is a lot better than I expected.  It's an old fashion science fiction adventure- yes the team that goes back in time is a bit dense  but you would not have a two hour movie if characters did the the smart thing all the time. Director Richard Donner stages some spectacular battle scenes so if you like medieval action youll love it- also its a cleverly designed DVD- so make some popcorn- sit back and have so fun.
0385720920|3.0|I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting out of this book, but I almost got it. This is my first Palahniuk novel. I haven't read Fight Club yet (though I've seen the movie and it is one of my favorites). It's an interestingly dysfunctional novel with some of the most interestingly dysfunctional characters. But there is little cohesion to the story. Some of the most interesting episodes we only get the beginning of and Palahniuk doesn't finish other than in telling us later rather than showing us at the time. The characters tend to be irritating and as a whole the story is a bit unbelievable. It's a good effort that falls just a bit short.
B00006V9A0|3.0|First of all: all the songs here are great, no doubt. But the disc has only one new song, which wasn't released on single (I wonder why:( ) There are quite some good songs out there that haven't been available to most fans previously, like Oh the guilt, Sappy or D-7, that SHOULD have made it to this album, but didn't. Yes, you are being ripped off. Get the original albums and don't touch this one with a ten foot pole. Five stars for the songs, one for relevance or the release.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|What you have here is one of the better movies ever made, and certainly one of George C. Scott's greatest (though his greatest is still Dr. Strangelove). It is a well written, well shot, well directed (this is the man who made Planet of the Apes) film that won a great many awards. There are some great action sequences and some fine acting moments. <br />The dvd is a little weak. There are a few trailers: Tora Tora Tora and The Longest Day, which are good choices and and audio essay, but it never played on my dvd. I don't know if that is just my copy or a flaw in them all. And that's it. No featurettes, documentaries, nothing else. A film this great deserves a little more care in packaging the dvd.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Gregg Toland's B&W photography stands the test of time. There is know way that this masterpiece is recieving less than five stars. There shouldn't even be a rating system for this.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|With all the praise that this movie garnered,I came away feeling as empty as the characters.<BR>I wondered why this movie did not explore more of the dynamics between Japanese/foreigner?<BR>The characters come together only out of lonely circumstances,and given any other place,would more than likely not be bothered knowing each other.<BR>Hanging out together in a different city does not make one a true friend,let alone soul mate.<BR>Sorry Sophia,this movie doesn't cut it.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|Ennio Morricone's Il Tramonto has a very short running time on the soundtrack.  It sounds like the rest of it was cut out.  Does anyone know what the longer piece of music is called???????<br />Thanks.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|The movie started well with a few humurous situations, but degenerated quickly into where one feels that SOMETHING will happen that will actually give the viewer a story or storyline.......alas, it was a complete waste of time......the person i was with (usually she watches deep dramatic movies with meaning) even said &quot; let's go&quot; so we hightailed it out of there along with most of the viewers.... this movie wasted more than an hour of my life.... it should air on &quot;discovery channel&quot; and may pass as a documentary about Japan, but nothing else...i felt cheated not because of the money i paid, but i felt let down since it had gotten such good reviews.... maybe because its about how 2 different people with totally different backgrounds can find something in common, but that in itself is a weak theme. Or it could have been done in a more exciting or interesting way that holds a viewers attention.........this way, the 'movie-documentary' is an evening wasted. One good thing i got out of it is that i wont eve watch another movie directed by this Coppolla woman... just proves that nepotism is a failure...just because you have the name, doesnt mean you can do it....
B0001ADAVK|5.0|This must be one of those love-it-or-hate-it movies, because I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews.  I absolutely loved it.  I don't think you have to be female to appreciate it, thought the message will certainly hit home deeper if you are.  Although we've come a long way from the 50's, the message still holds true - you can have it all, never settle - and I think this would make a wonderful graduation gift for any young woman about to embark on her journey of life.  Unlike what some of the other reviews state or imply, Julia Roberts' character was not anti-marriage or anti-tradition.  Her message was simply that women do not have to choose between marriage and a life of their own.  You can have marriage and a career, or a family and interests.  You can think for yourself instead of filling canned, predetermined roles set by dated ideals.  I found it empowering and inspiring.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This quirky, witty, and intelligent series is an instant cult-classic among hardcore sci-fi fans.  Basically a crossbreed of Star Trek's technology, and Wild, Wild West's settings and bravado, Firefly chronicles the travels of nine unique characters, as they ply the spacelanes.  It's not a show about exploring strange new worlds, and seeking out new life;  the show's writer, Joss Whedon, made it a parallel to our own world, just setting it 500 years in the future.  Any one of the characters aboard - like the Shepard Booke, a roving missionary, or Simon, a surgeon with serious family problems - could be one of us.  Ship's Captain Malcom &quot;Mal&quot; Renolyds is an ex-soldier that's always looking for work.  Sounds kind of like my life, actually.<br />Too bad Fox didn't realize what a hit it had on it's hands.  I only hope Sci Fi Channel picks it up...  And soon.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The other writers here summed up this concert video beautifully. I just wanted to add that this is probably the BEST concert video you will ever see! I have to admit that I really haven't listened to much of George Harrison's solo music, but after this video, plan to explore it more in-depth. What a touching tribute to someone who gave so much to the world of music. I rented this DVD, but plan on buying it TODAY -I would recommend it to anyone!

B0001CNRS4|4.0|Honey stars the beautiful Jessica Alba as of course Honey Daniels; a struggling dancer who works at a club as a bartender to dance. She is then caught the attention of Mike; a music video director. So she is brought on the set to the new Jadakiss and she pretty much steals the show. So now, she is famous, but while doing the music videos, she leaves behind a dancing class where she catches the eye of kids who are interested in her class. Some of the kids are not doing so well in life; one of them is a drug dealer for a small drug kingpin but eventually he gets caught up while his friends leave him hanging. Eventually as Honey gets known in the music video world, Mike then makes a move on her which Honey is caught off guard, she then tells him to shove it and leaves him at this party which she canceled plans with her best friend Gina to go to Atlantic City. Now when she gets back to work on the new video, she is fired and replaced. So now, while on her way of buying a new studio, she is then put into a financial crunch, and she decides to do a fund-raising dance show so that she can get the money to buy the dance studio. Then comes Missy Elliot to Mike, she didnt like the dancer he has, until he comes back to her like a poor dog looking for food from his former master. Eventually like all Hollywood endings, it ends on a good note. <br />The movie is good, but I felt some of the writing was a little poor, but the performances from Jessica Alba was strong. Not Acamedy Award strong, but this is worth checking out.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I was once told that the music in a movie can be the determining factor of whether the movie bombs or succeeds.  I disagree (there are many movies that have great soundtracks, but the movies are still lame).<br />Kill Bill was not a lame movie. Kill Bill was excellent and the music complemented it accordingly.  After seeing the movie, I was so excited to get the soundtrack, and it didn't disappoint.  The soundtrack is terrific.  The music moves you.  Different tracks have different tempos and beats, but all are wonderful and serve their purposes wonderfully (in the film and in my cd player).  I can listen to this any time of day.

6304789424|1.0|The mistakes made in the production of this film are unforgivable - Its not only a bad ALIEN movie but its probably one of the most dissapointing films I have ever seen.  The problem with it is the lack of tension and the fact that its depressing for the wrong reasons - People say Fincher had a hard time Directing/filming this - But HELLO! The history of this series of movies suggests that all the directors had a hard time - Its no excuse for a bad movie!  Ok if u havent seen this movie yet, here is an example to give u some idea - Imagine an alternative version of say 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi' -  In the first five minutes u discover that 'Han Solo', 'Yoda', 'Princess Leia', 'Threepio', 'R2D2' and 'Chewbacka' have all been murdered by Darth Vador. And Luke Skywalker has been infected with a fatal Jedi disease - no matter what happens he will die by the time this movie is over.  And then the rest of the movie is set on a boring planet with characters all played by boring British TV actors - And an unsatisfying climax where Luke kills Darth Vador but without any of the emotional discovery that could have been - Imagine how outraged the Star Wars fans would be!  That should give u an impression of how bad ALIEN3 is and what the fans felt when they saw it.  Avoid this movie.
0312995423|3.0|I like this kind of pseudo-scientific high-tech thriller and I found this book while on a business trip in Boise, ID. Dan Brown managed to keep me want to read on and find out what this unbreakable code is about and who's going to get it first.<br />However, I was quite disappointed when he got into languages other than English. I don't know about the Spanish and Italian, but the German used in this book certainly sounded like Mr. Brown had just written up some sentences in English and sent it through some free translation service on the Internet. No native German speaker would talk like the German character in Digital Fortress - wrong words, wrong grammar, wrong everything. What makes it worse is that Mr. Brown keeps pointing out that his main character's German was perfect and indistinguishable from the real thing. That might be true - for someone who has never bothered to learn any languages other than English and bad English.<br />Quite obviously Mr. Brown did not intend to have his book read outside the USA. Otherwise he would have put more effort into getting the linguistic side of his - after all - linguist main character right. This lack of research will pretty much prevent me from buying any other of Dan Brown's books.
B000002HH2|1.0|I listened to this C.D. a while back &amp; I almost went deaf this cd is awful this chick can not sing &amp; this album is so freaky &amp; scary!I could barely get through this whole cd! If I could give it zero stars I would! I have never heard of her kind of music it's like she has her own music catergory!If your into freaky &amp; different stuff then you probably will like it! all songs have a outer space sound with weird noises!I don't know what I can recommend to you if you like this except anything Bjork!
B0001Z53CY|2.0|okay first off im probably one of the biggest D12 fans around....<BR>Now i can understand why this album is not as good as i was expecting considering during the making of the album eminem was involved with the 2pac resurrection album, Obie's Cheers album and all the hype surrounding 50Cent.  But for mr. mathers to approve this album and let it go out into music stores is very surprising to me.  The beats on this album are all terrible except for a chosen few, and with eminem, kon artis, Dr. Dre, Kanye West and Red Spyda all producing on the album there is no excuse for the noise that the dirty dozen is rhyming on.<BR>1. Git Up... rhymes = 8, hook = 10, beat = 10<BR>2. Loyalty... rhymes = 7, hook = 9, beat = 9<BR>3. I'll Be Damned... rhymes = 7, hook = 6, beat = 5<BR>4. Dude (Skit) - just stupid<BR>5.

B0001HAHXW|5.0|I really do not share the opinion of those who think that Clapton is a tomb looter or that he is a kind of leecher of Robert Johnson work. Eric Clapton always was performing works of Robert Johnson and I think he honestly loves this music. After all the years he's been in the world of blues and R&amp;B he writes a kind of tribute to his roots and when listening to these terrific blues he is showing in the raw before our eyes, showing what he really feels. He is as famous and privileged as to make an album of what he really wants to play. What's wrong in that? I've had a really good time listening to his interpretation of Mr Johnson. His arragements are perfect and are the way Mr Johnson would have enjoyed if he had had the chance. By the way, the harmonica is terrific, a good choice too.
0345440900|2.0|This book came highly recommended to me, but I must admit I found it odd and inconsitent. The author is against nursing your baby to sleep (not an uncommon piece of advice) but advises *holding the baby's mouth shut* to discourage him. If that isn't the most bizarre thing I've read in a baby book, I don't know what is. On the positive side, she gives some interesting tips about reading your babies moods and trying to figure out what s/he really needs. Before buying this one, I'd check it out from the library to see if there's something worthwhile in it for you.
B000088E6D|5.0|I first saw and heard Michael Buble in a little throwaway movie I rented from the Block, called &quot;Totally Blonde.&quot;  Despite the fact that Buble is drop dead gorgeous, the thing that really got my attention in the movie was his voice.  His turn as the hipster-in-love club owner was sweet and genuine, but his voice was truly devastating.  I became an instant fan.<br />Any woman who does not dissolve into a little puddle at his rendition of &quot;Fever&quot; does not have blood in her veins.
B0002234LS|4.0|I loved Secret Window. It was one of the better movies that came out this year. Like all of Johnny Depp's movies it was different in it's own way. He isn't afraid to try things that most actors would never do. That's what makes his acting awsome. I thought the movie was hilarious, I've read the book Secret Window and it followed pretty closely. In the movie Mort Rainey is by himself most of the time. It's hard to keep an audience intertained when you are alone. Johnny Depp did an excellent job on keeping the audiece captivated. <BR>     I took my brother to see it and he usually doesn't like thriller-type movies, but he loved this one. If you are a fan of Johnny Depp's acting I highly reccomend you see this.
0790731940|4.0|Mel Gibson's Maverick is somewhat goofy but charming, sly, and fairly humorous.<br />A number of excellent cameos provide some comic relief, especially Danny Glover near the beginning of the movie. The biggest surprise for me was Jodie Foster, who, in an impressively rare comedic role, thankfully discards her repetoire of facial tics for a much more natural performance here.<br />The plot is kept pretty simple until near the end -- and the end has a great twist, which I won't divulge. Suffice it to say that your time will be well spent.<br />Recommended rental for sure, but also consider buying this excellent DVD because this comedy does well with repeat viewing.

B0001Z363W|5.0|I have been a BLS fan for four years now. BLS is a musically talented band, they dont need all the &quot;hardcore&quot; riffs, to prove something. A band that can switch styles of music, and play differant things than the same old thing, is a great band! Sure all other BLS albums are heavy, but this is a more serious, more deeper lyrics, more musically better album. This is by far one of my favorite cd's. I especially love &quot;House of Doom&quot; and &quot;Whiter shade of pale&quot;. THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR EVERY PERSON WHO APPRECIATES MUSIC!
6304698526|5.0|Director Peter Yates paradoxically mixes a documentary feel with glossy textures to create a the ultimate zen police drama.  Although mostly known for its thrilling chase scene (and the throaty rumble of McQueen's Shelby Cobra) Yates makes some some interesting statements about urban cop life.  The acting is superb.  The score by Lalo Shiffren is wonderfully evocative of '60's San Francisco.  Note the scenes shot through glass, from the opening credits through to the trapping of the killer in the revolving glass door.  Yates is preoccupied with showing us human beings through windows, through windshields, through their reflections.  By putting human nature &quot;under glass&quot; he's reminding us that appearance is always manipulated by film directors, even if it's only through the glass lens of the camera.  A remarkable film.

B00005JMUA|5.0|First off, I would like to state for the record, because people seem to be having a hard time with this one, that Kill Bill Volume 2 is NOT a sequel.  It is the second half of one absoloutly amazing epic.  One review declared that this movie was nothing but a rip-off of old kung-fu movies and spaghetti westerns.  Hello, half the point of this movie is that it is a tribute to all of Tarantino's old favorites, styles and directors, which is clear if you stay through the credits and read the thank yous.  This review had the gall to say that they thought that Uma Thurman wasn't right for the part... Quentin Tarantino WROTE the part for her.  To demean this film by calling it anything less than genius is a flaw that only the \\"Steven Segal\\" fans of this day could commit.<BR>Uma Thurman positively shone as The Bride, and Daryl Hannah was spectacular as Elle Driver (not to mention the beauty of a little poetic justice), and Michael Madsen was as bad-ass as Michael Madsen always is.  And eloquent would be a severe understatement in describing David Carradine's performance as Bill.  The editing, the banter, the raw emotion worked so well that you will find yourself paying to see this movie more that once.  Kill Bill Volume 2 is an absolout masterpiece.
B00005YW4H|1.0|I borrowed this album off a friend last year because I liked the single Don't Know Why. Let me start off by saying that there is a difference between sounding low-key and sounding unobtrusive, and I'm afraid that Norah Jones more often than not crosses in the latter category. Why? First of all:she has a voice that is suited to jazz and blues, however it lacks soul. She struck gold with Don't Know Why, but there are no other songs of that calibre on the album. Then there is the fact that all the songs are in the same tempo. It also seems as though all the instruments have been muted to such an extent that they don't grab your attention. As a result the album seems to flow together and it becomes almost impossible to distinguish tracks. The covers of Cold Cold Night and especially The Nearness of You by Hoagy Carmichael fall short because of this. True, Norah and her band are professionals. However, strangely enough this lends the whole affair a sort of superficialness. It removes all the authentic charm. Norah is playing it safe. There are no attention-grabbing, gut-wrenching songs on Come Away With Me. Most reviewers who liked this album claim that it is nice to chill out to and relax. This is what I mean, the record doesn't have sufficient depth to serve as something more than cocktail music. There are plenty of other female singers who write music that has a lot more depth and is more touching than this. If you want a soulful singer who uses jazz and blues influences, try Amy Winehouse with her debut album Frank.
B00005JMEW|4.0|...slice 'em and dice 'em.  Well, it's fun to watch.  It isn't very deep, but it's fun.  It's a pretty simple-minded plot: The Bride (a/k/a Black Mamba), very well played by Uma Thurman, is hit by a death squad on her wedding day and left for dead in a coma.  Four years later, she screams herself awake, kills off a thug who is violating her in her comatose state, and the joyride begins.<br /><br />The way the movie rockets along, we wonder if we're watching a movie or reading a comic book.  The Bride is out for revenge on the death squad that killed all nine members of her wedding party (\\"They should have made it ten,\\" she gloats, as she whacks her first victim, Vernita Greene, a/k/a Copperhead, played by Vivica Fox; all these assassins are named after snakes, for some reason) in front of her four year old daughter just off the school bus.  Then she's off to find her nemesis, a gorgeous Chinese-Japanese killing machine named O-Ren Ishii (Cottonmouth), played by the lovely Lucy Liu.  Their boss behind the hit, Bill, is mostly unseen and unheard, and evidently we have to wait for Part Two to see why he ordered the hit to begin with.<br /><br />In the meantime, there's gore galore all over the floor as The Bride mows down everyone who gets in her way.  Some of the action is so over the top that we wonder if we're supposed to take it seriously or say \\"yeah, right\\" and laugh out loud, as when O-Ren's posse of hired thugs take on The Bride all at once and all end up dead or mutilated.  Uh-huh.<br /><br />The film's cinematography is jaw-dropping, zipping from color to black/white to anime and back to live action; we're reminded of the mixed sequences that Oliver Stone used so effectively in \\"Natural Born Killers\\".  As for style vs. substance, \\"Kill Bill\\" is weighted so heavily in favor of the former that substance is almost an afterthought.  There's been a lot of comparison between this film and \\"Pulp Fiction\\"; there's blood and gore liberally splashing the screen in both movies, but \\"Pulp Fiction\\" was a masterpiece of great plot (convoluted though it was), great acting and great dialogue.<br /><br />\\"Kill Bill\\" ultimately boils down to great style, a lot of noise, and one fight after the next.  On a rating scale, I'd have to give it  five stars for style and two for substance which averages out to 3.5 stars, but it's great fun to watch so I'll round it off to four.  Let's just hope the story gains in substance in Part Two.<br /><br />Judy LindFiction\\" was a masterpiece of great plot (convoluted though it was), great acting and great dialogue.      \\"Kill Bill\\" ultimately boils down to great style, a lot of noise, and one fight after the next.

B00005AAFS|5.0|This is a spectacular album, IF you like Rammstein in the first place, they've expanded their sound (just look at Nebel and Mein Hertz Brennt) and gotten more melodic (Spieluhr).  I just need to say that half the reviewers here are morons: like the guy who claims to be from Germany but signs his review &quot;Danke Chen&quot;...uh huh...a german who can't spell German. And &quot;Zwitter&quot; being the noise that the birds make? Uhm...No, no that's not it either...
0385510438|1.0|\\"The Last Juror\\" - what a disappointment. It started out as such a promising grabber - only to fizzle into a frustrating bore. The character development was lame and where the heck was the plot? When reading Grisham's earlier books, I loved being \\"taken away\\"; after reading this book, I just feel \\"taken\\". <br />As a Legal Aid lawyer, and having lived in a small southern city, I applaud Mr. Grisham's adroit handling of complex racial and social issues in previous books. In \\"The Last Juror\\", the character development and plot did not go far enough to either deal effectively with issues or entertain. I'd like to see Grisham take the same characters and write a sequel that has some bite. <br />Please, Mr. Grisham, give us something rich and complex that we can sink our teeth into and then savor long after reading that last page.
B0001XAOMA|3.0|Why call this a Deluxe Edition, when purchasers of the Superbit edition get an exclusive Tobey Maguire commentary track (recorded for a special web-only showing of the movie in 2003).  Funny that the Superbit version has no extra features, nor other commentary tracks, besides the Maguire track.<br />So, if all you collectors want EVERYTHING there is to Spider-Man, you'll have to buy the discontinued collector's gift set (to get all the comics, Stan Lee DVD, senitype, and lithograph), the Deluxe version (for all the extras), and the Superbit version (for the Maguire commentary track).
0060278250|5.0|\\"Abhorsen\\" is the final book of Garth Nix's \\"Old Kingdom\\" trilogy, which could basically translate into the second half of \\"Lirael\\" (the first installment \\"Sabriel\\" stands on its own, but its follow-up \\"Lirael\\" needs \\"Abhorsen\\" in order for the story to be completed). In the final chapter of \\"Lirael\\", our four travellers Lirael, Sameth, Mogget and the Disreputable Dog have found sanctuary (albeit temporarily) at the Abhorsen's House where further revelations concerning Lirael and Sam's connection are discovered. With the missing pieces of her family's history now set into place, Lirael realises that the burden of Abhorsen-in-Waiting has now been placed on her.<br />Yet there is no time to dwell on that, as their enemies plans are now becoming clearer: the necromancer Hedge, along with his servant Chlorr have been raising two great silver hemispheres out of the earth. Sam's friend Nick is an unknowing accomplice in this activity, being the vessel of a tiny shard of silver from the spheres, a shard that contains within it the spirit of Orannis: the Destroyer. Orannis is the Ninth of the ancient \\"gods\\" (seven of which are remembered in the bells of the necromancers) that once shaped both the world and the benevolent Charter Magic, but as his name suggests he only tore down what the other raised up. And now, if the two hemispheres are joined, he will once more wreak havoc across the world.<br />And of course, it is up to Lirael and Sam to stop him: first by kidnapping Nick, and then in a desperate race to beat Hedge to the Lightening Farm in Ancelstierre, the non-magical kingdom across the border where Touchstone and Sabriel hit by hired assassins.<br />The pace doesn't let up for a moment in Nix's much anticipated conclusion, and if you've already invested a lot into the characters and situations of the first two books then it will be difficult to put down \\"Abhorsen\\" until the last page is read. Where \\"Sabriel\\" was an exciting read, and \\"Lirael\\" was fascinating and meandering, \\"Abhorsen\\" is quite simply explosive. There is barely a page where something drastic isn't happening, where our heroes aren't fighting, crawling, sneaking or running for dear life. It is quite simply an exhaustive read.<br />\\"Abhorsen\\" takes us further than we've ever gone into Death, all the way past the Ninth Gate, and I was pleased at how Nix presented the ultimate nature of Death. I had recently finished reading Phillip Pullmans \\"Amber Spyglass\\" and was rather depressed at his gloomy, despairing view of death, and Nix's realm of hideous zombies and dark rivers weren't really helping to cheer me up. However, without giving too much away, what Lirael finds in the final precinct of death is a place of both peace and future possibilities: nothing to dread at all.<br />Although Sabriel and Touchstone are not as prevalent as I would have liked, readers are treated to a nice reunion between all the major characters at the climax, and Mogget and the Dog's true identities are finally revealed. However, Nix leaves many questions unanswered and subplots left hanging - I (and many others) like to have a decent wrap-up to a book. \\"Abhorsen\\" however ends in the aftermath of the final battle, and I was dying to know what happens next! Where are Mogget and the Dog headed? Do Nick and Lirael fall in love? How does Lirael get on with her new family? What does the future hold? Furthermore, Mogget drops a tantalising little hint that reveals that Chlorr was once an Abhorsen, and yet nothing more is given on this subplot that just begs to be explored. The Old Kingdom itself is one of the most fascinating imaginary worlds I have come across, seeped in magic, mystery and history, and Nix often does little more than whet our imagination. Hopefully the quantity of dangling threads mean that he will eventually write more books on the gold mine that is the Old Kingdom - I hope so, as I'm eager to explore further.ndering, \\"Abhorsen\\" is quite simply explosive.

However, Nix leaves many questions unanswered and subplots left hanging - I (and many others) like to have a decent wrap-up to a book. \\"Abhorsen\\" however ends in the aftermath of the final battle, and I was dying to know what happens next! Where are Mogget and the Dog headed? Do Nick and Lirael fall in love? How does Lirael get on with her new family? What does the future hold? Furthermore, Mogget drops a tantalising little hint that reveals that Chlorr was once an Abhorsen, and yet nothing more is given on this subplot that just begs to be explored. The Old Kingdom itself is one of the most fascinating imaginary worlds I have come across, seeped in magic, mystery and history, and Nix often does little more than whet our imagination. Hopefully the quantity of dangling threads mean that he will eventually write more books on the gold mine that is the Old Kingdom - I hope so, as I'm eager to explore further.
B0001XAODY|3.0|The only redeeming value of this disc, besides the Superbit transfer, is an exclusive Tobey Maguire commentary track recorded for a 1-time-only web-showing of the movie in 2003.  The upcoming Deluxe version of the movie DOES NOT have this commentary track, and there's no other features to this disc.<br />So, if all you collectors want EVERYTHING there is to Spider-Man, you'll have to buy the discontinued collector's gift set (to get all the comics, Stan Lee DVD, senitype, and lithograph), the Deluxe version (for all the extras), and the Superbit version (for the Maguire commentary track).
B0000028M7|5.0|This is the definitive AIC album. The best grunge band, nearly in a tie with the mindblowing Pearl Jam, but certainly better than the great Nirvana. <br />&quot;Facelift&quot;, AIC's debut album, was raw, tortured, and heartfelt. &quot;Alice In Chains&quot;, AIC's final and best album was dark, grinding, creepy, had more refined guitarwork, and was just as suicidal as every other AIC album, only heavier. <BR>&quot;Dirt&quot; was the turning point. Cleans up the sound of &quot;Facelift&quot;, but doesn't quite employ as many muffling voice effects as &quot;Alice In Chains&quot;. Jerry Cantrell's tortured, demonic lyrics fit perfectly with Layne Staley's also tortured vocals. Staley's sound is moody, depressed, hostile, heartfelt, demonic...quite simply one of the best voices to ever come out of a human being. <br />&quot;Dirt&quot; is full of metal riffs, but also softer riffs, much in the style of say...Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, and many other greats. <BR>But, most importantly, &quot;Dirt&quot; is a dark passage through the depressed catacombs of both Cantrell's and Staley's inner mental workings. It contains many suicidal lyrics such as &quot;I want to taste dirty stinging pistol in my mouth, on my tongue, I want you to scrape me off the walls,&quot; many deprived, challenged, and all around amazing lyrics. The music eases these into utter perfection. <br />This is an album to listen to if you're feeling depressed. When I am depressed, &quot;Dirt&quot; often gives me something to believe in, something to live for. <br />I love Alice In Chains.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I've known of the game, never really played it but I really enjoyed the movie. If you've never played the game, don't worry, everything is all there for you to catch up. I found the movie had a lot of story, the action and suspense of the whole film really carries it through. The acting isn't anything oscar worthy but still good. I really got caught up in the whole film and surprise that such a good storyline could come from a video game. I'm sorry i missed out on this when it was in theaters but luckily caught the dvd. I will definately be watching RE2 when it comes out later this year.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Audioslave is the result of the 2000 breakup of the political hard rock/rap powerhouse Rage Against The Machine, where the incredible musicians of the group where left all by their lonesome when Zack De La Rocha, the group's political idealist, lyricist, and vocalist, decided to move on to other things.<BR>Finding themselves frontmanless, they decided to team up with Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell.<br />The result should've been: RAW POWER. Combine Chris Cornell's mesmerizing, wailing vocal intensity with RATM's sonic metal assault, and you would expect a raging, rabid dog, tearing down everything in it's path.<BR>Instead, we get a big dog with no teeth. Full of power, but no way to express it. Without De La Rocha's political rage, RATM is nothing.<br />What makes this album even more disappointing is this: the musicianship and riffing is, as it should be, top notch. The vocals are the best possible. Cornell's lyrics are good too. But none of these fit together properly. Where is the power? The fury? The angst? The RAGE?<br />This should have been an amazing power metal album, not the generic hard rock mess it is.<br />We had to lose RATM and Soundgarden for THIS??? WHY?!?!?!
B00009V7RF|5.0|Well done, black eyed peas. U have just created pure brilliance. I had never heard of the group be4 'where is the love' i must admit, but after that I realised that they are something new & special. There are no bad tracks (actually, the bonus tracks are quite rubbish, but still...), and they all sound funky or just plain amazing! Let me guide u thru the songs...<br />1. Hands Up - a funky introduction to the album but doesn't have fergie singing it. 4/5<br />2. Labor Day (It's A Holiday) - this is a gr8 holiday song (ud never guess by the title, would you?), with samples from someone. I think it might be Madonna. 4/5<br />3. Let's Get Retarded - the new single, ive heard, and thats gd! this is 1 of the best tracks on the album. 5/5<br />4. Hey Mama - the 3rd single. quite jamaican, but funky and different, like everything they do. 4/5<br />5. Shut Up - the 2nd single. its quite a lot of peoples faves, but i just think its gd, not outstanding. 4/5<br />6. Smells Like Funk - another fave. upbeat, simple, classy, and - of course - funky! 5/5<br />7. Latin Girls - a more slow song which is gd as there aren't many slow songs on the album. 4/5<br />8. Sexy - a really long intro without singing, but then it gets on to will.i.am singing. its actually quite gd. 4/5<br />9. Fly Away - ANOTHER fave! it really doesn't disapoint and shd b a single. fergie co-writes this. 5/5<br />10. The Boogie That Be - a song 4 the dancefloor. wot more shd i say? 4/5<br />11. The Apl Song - 1 of 2 slow songs on this album. i really like it. 4.5/5 (does that work?)<br />12. Anxiety (ft. papa roach) - the only song thats not a bonus cut that isn't very gd. 2 rocky 4 my liking. 3/5<br />13. where is the love (ft. justin timberlak) - my absolute fave. it has such meaning, and feeling. although its quite intresting that the only no.1 theyve had was something 2 do with jtimberlake... 5/5<br />14. third eye - a gr8 end 2 the song. 5/5<br />15. rock my s**t - not at all gd. 1/5<br />16. whats going down - a bit betta but not much. why is it that only the UK have 2 be stung by these rubbish bonus stuff? 1.0001/5
B00003CXDB|5.0|WALL STREET is Stone's best film.  Better than PLATOON.  Better than JFK.  Better than NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  I can't believe how little praise it gets.<br />WALL STREET is more than just an indictment of the 80's.  It's a treatise on wealth and how quickly it makes you rationalize behavior you didn't think you were capable of.  Obviously, this is a relevant lesson in any era. <br />Plenty of other film have attempted to preach this same message.  Most of them have failed.  And even the good ones don't contain anything that can compare to the scene where Sheen gets busted.  Or Gordon's famous &quot;Greed is good&quot; speech (sounds a lot like what we're hearing about globalization, doesn't it?).<br />Anyway, WALL STREET is a film that muckrakes as it entertains.  How many movies can you say that about?
B000002MY3|5.0|In 1995,21-year-old Alanis Nadine Morrisette hit a large chunk of paydirt with JAGGED LITTLE PILL. From the release date through the end of 1996,she scored quite a few Top 20 hits. This album was a debut smash. Other female artists sharing that distinction include Whitney Houston(her '85 self-titled debut),Sheryl Crow(TUESDAY MUSIC NIGHT CLUB),Carole King(TAPESTRY) and Mariah Carey(her '90 self-titled debut). They all won Grammys,including Alanis,for their debut albums. The album title comes from YOU LEARN,which was a hit. Other hits include HEAD OVER FEET,HAND IN MY POCKET and IRONIC. The thirteenth and final track on the CD is a so-called uncredited reprise of YOU OUGHTA KNOW. Great lyrics in that song(\\"Are you thinking of me when you f--- her?\\",\\"Is she perverted like me?\\"). I know an infamous band who performs at bars and nightclubs and they've done some of these songs. Great album!
B000069HPL|5.0|Forget Dilbert.  This is the definitive anti-office satire.  <br />In fact, OFFICE SPACE is so funny that I don't even think you have to have worked in an office to appreciate it.  It's a classic, and it's the kind of comedy you'll want to tell others about.
B0000636UN|4.0|This album is full of guest artists. That's why it's a bonafide hit. STEVE McQUEEN is an ode to the late Hollywood great. SOAK UP THE SUN with Liz Phair,was the first and biggest hit on this album. One of my favorites is YOU'RE AN ORIGINAL,which features Lenny Kravitz singing background vocals. Stevie Nicks sings background vocals on DIAMOND ROAD and the title track. Don Henley joins Sheryl on IT'S SO EASY(not to be confused with the song recorded by the Everly Brothers and Linda Ronstadt). Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks joins Sheryl on ABILENE. All the other songs are good. I truly love the beginning of STEVE McQUEEN(&quot;I went to bed in Memphis,I woke up in Hollywood&quot;).
B00003CWOL|1.0|DOGMA has scores of \\"comedic moments\\" pumped into it.  The problem is, none of them are the least bit funny.  <br />Example: Rock flops down and is asked if he knows Christ.  Rock replies, \\"Hell yeah, nigga owes me fi dollas!\\"  I kid you not.<br />At one point, a Sh*t Monster appears.  No, I don't mean Alanis Morrissette.  An actual creatue made of feces shows up for our \\"amusement.\\"  Are you starting to see a pattern?<br />DOGMA tries desperately to push all the comedic buttons it can, but each attempt yields nada.  The cast can't save this ungodly flop.  Neither can the so-called \\"message.\\"  Hell, I don't even think the God it claims to glorify could make this film watchable.  <br />If DOGMA doesn't make you an atheist, nothing will.
B00005JMEW|1.0|All this movie did is confirm my suspicions that QT is a loudmouth wannabe auteur who can't get over shocking people for<BR>fun and profit.  Idiot.  Why doesn't he just keep his adolescent femme fatale stroke fantasies to himself instead of inflicting them on the world?<br />And I just don't get America. People freak out over a tiny glimpse of part of Janet Jackson's breast, and yet this ultra-violent, dehumanizing, brutal, over-hyped empty garbage continues to be produced. Go figure.  Anything for a buck in Tinseltown, I suppose. The saddest part is that children will watch it.  This filth is one of the best arguments for censorship I can think of.  Way to set the bar lower, Quentin!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in Translation provokes viewers to wonder what they would do given the same circumstances.  If you're not provoked, then you're probably not old enough or smart enough (thus the inane, fatuous reviews).  This film ranks high with such understated greats as The Accidental Tourist, Local Hero and Bill Murray's The Razor's Edge.  Of course many people won't enjoy it since it doesn't spoonfeed.
0618526412|5.0|There is much to be said about this book and all of it good.  The characters within the pages are memorable and demonstrate the old saying that \\"everyone is their own world\\".  In the heart of the tale is focus on the solitude that exists in some lives.  Additional points to ponder are racial justice through the eyes of a black physician that must wage his own fight after having his son jailed and misunderstanding as the various characters talk to a man that is unable to speak in John Singer.  They assume that he is deeply concern without ever really giving thought to the truth of his quite sessions of listening to them going on and on about their injustices.  Overall, the characters are seeking to air their discontent with the world while attempting to grasp the reality that has been dealt them.  A very good book and one that I would highly recommend.
B00005JMUA|3.0|ok dont get me wrong i like kill bill vol 2 (the dialogue was amazing) but i had a problem with the fact that it was incredibly slow paced at times. the movie was a little too long for an \\"action\\" movie that had about 6 min of total fighting in it/ but thats ok because i understand what QT was trying to bring out in the second film so that doesnt bother me. my problem is that i think he's cashing in. yes QT does steal from the best (he might as well be brian de palma's fluffer) but i think at times it was overdone and he stretches out a pretty basic plot. revenge. I still think that this movie could have been combined to make one kikass film (that should have lasted anywhere from 2.5 to 3.5 hours.)  the fact that he made too seperate films and made us wait all this time and now after seeing both movies i can easily say it was all for the $ and this could have been ONE awesome friggin film.
0812932293|5.0|While Branson is certainly intelligent, creative, and perseverant, his business ventures illustrate just how much luck and good timing play into becoming successful.  The stories also show how people pursue numerous ideas, end up failing at many of them, learn from prior experience, and finally -at long last- they break through.  Branson's business pursuits are a testament to value investing - make a number of risks with a limited downside, yet a few can pan out and pay off handsomely.  The importance of networking is also shown, which is how Branson connected with new ideas and valuable people. <br />Branson's adventures are great reminder of all the fun and excitement life has to offer.  What a contrast to most people's habits of passively sitting in front of the television, routinely doing chores, and other low-energy ways of passing the time.  While most people are not going to go out and literally risk their life, this does serve a useful point of comparison.  <br />This is a quick, action-packed read, full of insights into business and life.  Recommended to a wide range of readers, who will find this informative, interesting, and enjoyable.
B00003CXRP|1.0|I thought that this movie was terrible.  Why?  Well, the movie went nowhere, told us nothing, and was nothing but one guy talking to a volleyball.  Sound exciting?  I mean, even if you like Tom Hanks it wouldn't bring up the quality of the movie.  The sustaining forces of this movie were Wilson, the infamous volleyball, and the &quot;undelivered package,&quot; which really means nothing held it together.  Now, obvioulsy I do not recommend this movie to you, but I do agree that you should at least see it once, and maybe that friend you have that says they &quot;like&quot; it will show it to you for free.  It is not worth the money, and I saw it in theatres!
B0000027RL|5.0|What is the matter here.  Look its a great PEARL JAM ALBUM.  Not a test to see if you like all bands, or if your a rasist.  Hell I HATE pointless rap and r&amp;b music, but my black roommate doesn't.  Does that make me a rasist.  For all you REAL music lovers here, love this music because when you get down to it, its a cut from the same mold as other truely original music bands from Incubus, to Dave Matthews.  Enjoy.
B00005JMSE|4.0|Now, when I saw the trailers I felt that this movie was going to be a big flop, a disappointment, a let down, a, ah you get the picture.  It wasn't though by any means.  The movie, going along with the many comic based movies of recent, is just a good fun, and quality filled movie.  Now it is not going to necessarily work your mental muscles, but it is perfectly okay to relax those every now in then.  The characters are humorous, the plot is creative, and well, it is a movie that I personally would not mind watching again, which is saying something; take my word for it.  If the Hulk turned you away from comic based movies then come back with this one, and it will charm your socks off.  In other words, I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I bought this battery to have as a backup for the identical one that came with my Canon Powershot G5. The battery is fabulous. I've always been very displeased with the shooting capacity of digital cameras in general - they would run out of battery in a very short time. This battery was one of the deciding factors for me buying a Canon Powershot G5. According to a test on dpreview, it's the best performing battery (when used in the G3) out there for any digital camera (at the time of testing).<br />I've taken a few thousand pictures with it so far, and I'm very pleased. When using the LCD display for a mix of movies and pictures (on my G5), I get around 600 pictures out of one fully charged battery. I've never completely &quot;emptied&quot; the battery with the LCD screen off (preview only), but based on my experience so far, I would think that you'll get somewhere between 600-1000 pictures out of one fully charged battery - maybe more - when the LCD is not on all the time. If you take a lot of pictures (I can easily take 500 on a weekend trip), I would still recommend buying an extra battery though. I'm panicked about ever running out of battery (or memory) while I'm shooting.<br />Should you buy a cheaper non-Canon brand equivalent battery? I've not tried an equivalent for the BP-511, but I've got a DigiPower equivalent for my Canon Powershot S200 (Elph II), and it's crap. I would never buy and equivalent for my G5 camera, because in my experience, it's quite apparent that you get what you pay for.<br />Pros:<BR>* Extremely good capacity - 500-1000 pictures on one charge with normal use.<BR>* Charges relatively quick in my G5 - about 90 minutes<br />Cons:<BR>* Very heavy. It'll weigh down your camera, but for the capacity it provides, I personally think it's worth it.<br />Conclusion: It's a very good battery - capacity is fabulous. I've had no problems with it - it doesn't overheat, it doesn't stop working, and so far after about 6 months of operation, I've noticed no drop in capacity. I give it an unconditional 5 stars!!!
B0001HLVS2|2.0|First of all, I will get my bias out of the way and say I haven't seen that many \\"sea\\" movies that I have liked.  So when I saw this one, and came to realize that it is more about the relationship of two characters, Russel Crowe (Captain) and Paul Bettany (ship's surgeon,) then I realized I just did not like it.  Now this one isn't a creative mental movie like Crowe's earlier part was in A Beautiful Mind, and it lacked the action in Gladiator.  Those aspects gave the other movies the acclaim that they received.  This one however leaves fighting as a tie-in to all the events going on in their busy personal lives, raise sail here, swab deck there.  Give it a chance; because open-minded is better than close-minded, still I felt personally disappointed by the movie more than anything.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|To anyone reading this, I promise that you will not regret seeing this wonderful, amazing movie.  <BR>It is the closest thing there is to travelling back in time to be aboard a British warship in 1805. The HMS Surprise pursues a French privateer ship, the Acheron, after surviving a devastating surprise attack at the opening of the movie. The screenplay, acting, cinematography, soundtrack, and attention to historical detail are so well done that it's hard to imagine a more well-made film.  <br />This story is more about the characters than about the political conflicts of its time. It depicts naval life in as much historical detail as possible, and the ways in which the men cope with the isolation and constant danger in their lives. (There are some endearing deleted scenes showing more of this.)<br />The two main characters, Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) are old friends who engage in frequent debate about matters of duty, honour, scientific discovery and so on.  Although much of the plot revolves around their friendship, there is such excellent characterization everywhere else in the film that you become truly interested in what happens to everyone we have come to know in this story.  It is a touching story of friendship, courage, resilience, and loss.  It is well worth anyone's while.  It's nice to know that there are so many books in the series- I really look forward to reading them now.
B0001Z363W|4.0|I rushed out to buy this cd and have mixed feelings on it, though i enjoyed the cd more than not. I'm a big fan of Zakk's music, and own Stonger Than Death, 1919 Eternal, and The Blessed Hellride, plus his concert dvd, so i was excited to learn he had a new cd out. I enjoy the softer side of Zakk, but i found the cd to be a bit too long.  I think some of the  songs could be cut a bit shorter, and is it just me or does Zakk's voice sound like it's getting worse? Some of the harder tracks on this cd it sounds like Zakk's voice is going; though on some of the really mellow tracks his voice is really good. I thought that 1919 Eternal and The Blessed Hellride were his best cds and that his voice sounded amazing on those two discs. I found on the new cd that with some of the songs, his gruff screaming didn't always match up with the slower material and his voice just sounded forced. Maybe this cd will grow on me the more i listen to it, and it probably will. I'm just writing my review after a first listen. I was very impressed with a lot of it though. I enjoyed his version of Whiter Shade Of Pale. The first track called Crazy Or High was a definite standout.  My main beef with the cd is lack of photos of Zakk himself, and no lyric sheet. The title of the cd is not misleading, as it's definitely a softer version of BLS for those of you suffering from a hangover, yet still want to listen to his stuff. I think this cd is important to Zakk's career, as many of his fans have been wanting a cd of his more slower and mellower stuff. Hey, if you want to hear his harder stuff, listen to the other discs. It's good to chill out and relax now and then.  I think the reviews will be split: some will love it, some will hate it. But i think more will love it than hate it.  I don't think this is Zakk's best effort by far, but it's a damned good must-have, and worth adding to your BLS collection. This will make an excellent stoner cd, as is ALL of Zakk's music!!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I bought discovery a few years back, and to be honest I wasn't impressed, so into the back of the collection it went. Then I saw Interstella 5555. Now I can't stop listening to the damned thing, and smiling when certain tracks come on, because Discovery finally has a context that is pleasing.<br />   Interstella 5555 really is an over the top, sentimental piece of anime, and that's what is so great about it. The fact that the hero of the story flies around in a gigantic space guitar only really bothers you the first time you see it. <BR> <BR>   I really liked that there is zero dialogue in this movie, just Discovery as the soundtrack, and lots of non-verbal communication, meaning that there's no need for translation, or bad dub-overs. One can view it in any country.<br />   The animation is trully top notch, if not heavily 70's themed. It's deffinately a cheesy movie, but that cheese pays off big time in the form of charm, and in the end a kind of sci-fi optimism, which is kind of nice in an age when everyone is surly, sarcastic, and irony ladden. <br />   This movie will leave you feeling good, so why not buy it?
B00006690G|5.0|Can't really say much because all af his albums are 5 stars for me because he is my favourite rapper and he has done a very good job through out his carer and he is obviously going to be top rapper in no time and i cant wait till his new album releases. (RESPEST)
B000059MEK|5.0|...One really needs to watch the movie Interstella 5555 to put this album into proper context. Amazon should be offering the movie and the album as a package deal, instead of coupling it with their first album. I myself never really appreciated what a technical masterpiece this album really is. Now that I've the right context this record seems just amazing. Unfortunately I was initially too obtuse to really hear what was going on with the tracks because I wanted a cd with a little bump while I was driving. Right now it's the only album I can listen to. I guess I just love Vocoders. Watch the movie, buy the record.
B00008S2VG|5.0|WOW!<BR>I just LOVED this album. I first listened to it some weeks ago and I must confess that it took so long for me to do so because of what Ive heard about it all this time (I dont know, people made me think it was strange and anti-american). So, after listening to it I fell in love with this songs. Its gorgeous, full of energy and most of this beats and sound are totally new for me, like if it came from another time. Madonna at her very best!!!<BR>And I love LOVE PROFUSION, what a hit!!!
B00006879E|5.0|I loved this cd from beginning to end. There isn't one track that I don't love. I can't stop listening to it. I actually had to hide from myself so I wouldn't overplay it. If there is one cd I would recommend to buy it's this one. The beats are amazings, the singing soulful and the lyrics absolutely meaningful.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Talked into watching &quot;Firefly&quot; episodes by a friend of mine, I was immediately hooked.  This is wonderful story telling.  First rate acting!  Great production values.  It is amazing to me that the powers that be have so lost any original thought or future vision that they cancelled this series before it really made an impact.  I was very pleased to see that Josh Weedon is making a movie. We fans can only hope it contains the elements that made this series a success in my mind.<br />Shorebird
B000002P5R|5.0|First Rays Of The New Rising Sun was an uncomplete album intended to be a double lp. Many of the songs on the album were scattered over the years on different albums from Rainbow Bridge, War Hero's, and The Cry Of Love. This album really proves how far a genius like Jimi Hendrix could go with his music. In the process of the album their were many different technique's involved. Jimi Hendrix was at the peek of his career he was also very drained out from his 1970 American tour. Jimi Hendrix played over dozens of area's and festivals from Atlantic Pop, to The Isle Of Wight. On the side he was working on the album First Rays Of The New Rising Sun.<br />Unfortunately Jimi Hendrix died in the process of the album. Some 20+ years latter Al Hendrix ( Jimi's father ) bought the rights back to his music and named his company Experience Hendrix. That same company would release First Rays Of The New Rising Sun in full format with engineer Eddie Kramer. This album remains one of my very favorite albums as others just cant compare to the genius Jimi Hendrix really was. Highly Recomened!
B0001WTUH6|2.0|Think a film about a war between vampires and werewolves sounds cool?  Think again.<br />The vampires in UNDERWORLD have no supernatural powers to speak of, beyond the fact that they're immortal and have superhuman strength.  Instead of using stealth, cunning, and teeth they fight with lots and lots of guns.<br />The werewolves don't fare much better.  In addition to being immortal and having superhuman strength, the werewolves (called \\"lycans\\" in the film, short for lycanthropes) have the ability to change their form regardless of whether or not the moon is full.  However, the change is little more than cosmetic, as they don't get any stronger.  They grow sharp claws and teeth, but can't hold a gun in wolf form so it's pretty much a wash.  Their preferred method of fighting is - you guessed it - lots and lots of guns (in human form).<br />So basically UNDERWORLD takes a really cool concept, removes everything cool about it, and gives us a standard issue post-MATRIX shoot-em-up.  Only problem here is we don't know which side to root for as neither side has any agenda regarding the fate of humans - in fact neither side has any use for humans at all (the vampires drink cloned blood in bags, the werewolves just eat whatever).  So although we'd like the protagonists to survive, we couldn't care less about whatever cause they're fighting for, if any.<br />2 stars for impressive effects and Kate Beckinsale in tight leather.  Other than that this film earns a big SO WHAT?
B0001HLVS2|3.0|Fans of author Patrick O'Brian might be a bit miffed at the plot change from the British/American skirmish of 1812 to the British/French of 1805.  Actually, the facts are not all that important to director Peter Weir as are the sights and sounds of this film.  Capt. Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is about the most likable and mild-mannered sea-faring Captain since Captain Kangaroo; a casting mistake if ever there was one.  The ship's more level headed doctor (Paul Bettany) seems more like an early nineteenth century character dealing with tragedy on a daily basis.  The plot is terribly simple with battle after battle with buddy bonding scenes around the dinner table spliced in between.  The only original highlights are the Galapagos scenes.  However, one must give high points to Weir for his realistic battles, ships and special effects.  The sounds are inspiring and everything looks and sounds true.  In fact, the effects are the true stars of this film.  I can't say I would recommend purchasing this DVD, but a viewing on a boring Sunday afternoon would do it justice.  There are some standard trailers and the widescreen format can't be beat with any epic story.  2 stars for story and 4 stars for visuals and sound seem fair.
1592400876|3.0|By chance, I've been reading another new book about the rights and wrongs of punctuation during the time 'Eats, Shoots' has been getting extensive press. I think that most readers would find this other book more interesting, and *much* more useful, than 'Eats.' The book is 'Your Own Words,' by Barbara Wallraff, who has written the 'Word Court' and 'Word Fugitives' columns in the Atlantic Monthly and elsewhere. I have first-hand experience applying Ms. Wallraff's style and usage precepts over the years, and I think readers who care about language will be glad to know what she has to say.
0783114893|5.0|One of the scariest movies I have ever seen, The Hitcher is relentless in its intensity. Jim Halsey (C. Howell) picks up a hitchhiker (R. Hauer) on his way to San Diego who soon admits he killed his last ride. Hauer says, \\"You know that driver from that last car? I cut off his legs\\". It doesn't take more than that before Jim is able to trick and force the 'hitcher' out of his car. Thinking that it's over, Jim soon sees the hitcher riding in another family's car, knowing he will kill them all. Reporting him to the police is of no use and even after they capture him, he pulls a shocking twist on everyone. Jim befriends a lonely waitress (J. J. Leigh) who believes his story, but soon she ends up in the middle (literally) between them (the most revolting scene in the film). It's a suspenseful, non-stop, killer maniac fright ride. It becomes clear the hitcher is out to frame Jim for multiple murders or kill him. The ending is just as frightening as the rest, but I guarantee you won't leave this film feeling good - just shaken up. Not for the squeamish, but maybe a good date movie.
B0001I55OC|1.0|Ever had one of those crazy dreams (probably after you've made one too many trips to the salad bar at Medieval Times) where you suddenly find yourself back in the year 1357, holing up in a French castle while all around you French and British forces are enacting the Hundred Years' War?  If you have, it was probably more interesting than what we see in \\"Timeline\\" - and if you haven't, I am sure you could come up with a more convincing and intriguing scenario than the makers of this film have devised with the same material.  Though based on a Michael Crichton novel, \\"Timeline\\" is about as bad a sci-fi fantasy as anyone could ever possibly imagine.  In this time-tripping tale told by an idiot, a group of modern-day archaeologists in France are transported through a \\"wormhole\\" to 14th Century Europe to help retrieve the leader of their dig who has (don't ask how) become stuck in the past.<br />Time-travel yarns require a certain intelligence and finesse to make them both intriguing and convincing.  \\"Timeline\\" is ludicrous from the very outset, for less than five minutes after our intrepid little heroes first learn of the existence of the way-back machine, they are all suited up in their Medieval garb and heading back in time, utterly unprepared for what they might find there.  Once they get to their destination, the plot bogs down in endless scenes of armored men on horseback a-hacking and a-hewing away at the anachronistic visitors.  I mean, whose bright idea was it to set up this time machine premise and then send the characters not forward into a potentially interesting future but BACKWARDS to take part in a creaky, hackneyed Medieval romance?  It's one thing to set up this time-bending scenario; it's quite another to do absolutely nothing with it.  Oh sure, there's the usual deep-think palaver about whether or not these folks from the future should risk tampering with history etc., but the filmmakers' sights seem to be set on more mundane matters like elaborate action and fight sequences and puppy-love romance.  And, of course, all these archaeologists turn out to be expert swords- and bowmen, fully the equal in skill and talent to their 14th Century brethren.  On the whole, the acting is amateurish, the dialogue inane and the special effects virtually nonexistent for a film of this type.  The film, in fact, both looks and feels like a third-rate, throwaway project designed for no purpose other than to give Paramount Studios a corporate-loss write-off come tax time.<br />\\"Timeline\\" is like H.G.

B00005JMEW|5.0|I loved Kill Bill Volume 1. I can not wait to see Kill Bill Volume 2.<br />This movie was chopped up just like all of Quentin Tarantino's movies and you had to pay close attention. The fighting scenes were the best. (...) I was really proud of Vivica Fox, I never saw her in a fight scene and I throroughly enjoyed it. It was so good that I was disappointed in the end that she did Kill Bill.
B00018D44U|5.0|I admit, I only bought her first album because she was fine as hell. Then I listened to \\"Come Away With Me\\", and was blown away. What even impressed me more is how well she adapts to different genre's of music from jazz to blues, blues to country, country to dare I say a mini duet with Andre 3000 of Outkast, and all came off not good, but damn good. She's a breath of fresh air in an industry full of blonde bimbo's, gangbangers, pimps, drug dealers, suburban whites acting black, etc.<br /><br /> Now on to this gem. Seems she went more folk and country this go around, which doesn't disappoint. Look, I don't listen to neither, I'm more of a jazz, old school r&b, neo soul guy, and I have to say Norah came of well, I loved the duet with Dolly Parton. Her trademark stuff still stands out, like \\"Sunrise\\" and my favorite track \\"Above Ground\\". Is it better that the first, you decide, I say both are even, which isn't a bad thing.<br /><br /> My advice to Norah as devoted fan to music is to keep doing what you do best, your fans love you for who you are. Please don't sell out to the mainstream, like other artists, who build a solid fan base, and stab them in the back for pop star royalty.
B0000013G9|5.0|Intro- it's really good gives a guys perspective on each girl in the group.<br />Creep- this is a clever song about cheating to find affection, but yet it kinda goes against what TLC stand for, but what the hell it's a good song.<br />Diggin' On You- One of the most unique, and coolest songs ever made, should have been a no.1 smash. T-boz soundz wonderful on this song.<br />Case of the Fake People- kinda sounds like prince meets janet. i like the drum beat in this song and the way chilli spits out the ab libs durrin the middle of the song.<br />Red Light Special- wow from the first cd you'd never thing TLC would come out with a slow song this powerful. This is prolly one of the best songs on the album.<br />Waterfalls- very different and unique once again. love the way t-boz sounds on this one, and lisa's rap is off the chain. One of the best songs ever recorded.<br />Let's Do It Again- Chilli, and T-boz give their all on this one. very good bedroom song.<br />If I Was Your Girlfriend- Wow when i first heard this song i didn't think it was a prince song. Until i heard the orginal on the radio and i was like i like TLC's version better because the put a lil more into it.<br />Take Our Time- doesn't sound like you typical TLC song, but chilli sounds her best on this one.<br />Switch- Damn this song is off the chain should have been in the earlier part of the cd though, because it's very catchy.<br />Sumthin Wicked This Way Comes- very soulful unique, and real. great song.<br />Overall this is prolly in my top 10 favorite cds of all time. TLC is an awesome group and their songs and positive energy will never be forgotten.
0761536434|4.0|This was a great book. it has a lot of characteristics of a good novel, telling the story of video games, from pong to pokemon, as the title suggests. however, i was looking for a book i could use to research my term paper on the history of video games. unfortunately, this wasn't organized in a way i could use it like that. if i wanted to find information on nintendo, i had to skim the book until iot started talking about nintendo.<BR>i found this book especially interesting, since i am at the age where video games are common, but i was never subject to early games, anyuthing before about the SNES. my first video game experience was the N64. so this book really gives me a lot of background info on how current games evolved.<BR>overall, i would reccommend this book, but not for research. i actually wouldn't mind reading it like any other book, from start to finish. it would be worth checking out of your local library, at least.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|\\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" seems to me to be a little better than \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\". Maybe this is because I resigned myself to believing that the third [and hopefully final installment] would be, like \\"Reloaded\\", all whiz-bang special effects and little substance. This turned out to be a correct assumption. But not expecting much in the story department allowed me to appreciate the visuals, which are awesome. Ironically, what rules the making of both \\"Matrix\\" sequels seems to be modern machinery; in this case, digital computers. Did the filmmakers see the irony? Modern machines dictate that special effects render plot and good scripting obsolete in movies about mankind's defeat by machines? <br />This episode continues the attack of the computers/machines on the human population, which has taken refuge underground. As the machines bore through the earth relentlessly in their attack on what's left of mankind. Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and the others continue to do their best to salvage the human race. Neo, after finally meeting the ultimate machine and proposing a truce, takes on the nefarious Agent Smith in a battle that goes on and on and on. <br />I think the `problem' with the sequels is rather simple. Commerce dictated that, since the original \\"Matrix\\" was so successful, sequels should be made. In any art form, often the original product is whole within itself. How could anyone paint a sequel to The Mona Lisa? The classic movie \\"Casablanca\\" ended with a question mark, but could a \\"Part 2\\" truly have gone any further? My conclusion is that, if commerce dictates sequels, so be it, but it is foolish of us to expect them to equal, much less to exceed, the original.
B00005JM02|5.0|My family and I loved this movie.  It is very funny and has beautifully animated ocean scenes.  Another great movie from Disney.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|\\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" is probably the best movie ever made about life aboard an early 19th Century naval vessel. There is an epic storytelling quality here that is reminiscent of  classics like \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\". It also has a grace and elegance not often seen in movies - epic or otherwise - these days. <br />Ironically, all these fine qualities may have limited its commercial appeal. The bulk is the movie is about the two main characters - Capt. Jack Aubrey [Russell Crowe] and the ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin [Paul Bettany] and their relationship with each other and with the rest of the crew. There are only two major battles scenes, which, while impressive, run only a few minutes each. <br />Capt. Aubrey is commander of the Surprise, a rather small and outdated British vessel. The Napoleonic Wars are in full swing, and England is in danger of invasion by the French. Aubrey and crew are off the coast of Brazil, where they spot a very fast and modern French ship. Aubrey decides to pursue it, and the chase takes him all the way around the tip of South America to the Galapolos Islands off the coast of Chile. There, the final confrontation between the two vessels takes place.<br />Crowe and Bettany are superb as two friends whose differences make them perfect counterpoints. To those who are more into narrative than action, watching these two play off each other is the highlight of the movie. <br />\\"Master and Commander\\" is marvelous entertainment and quite possibly the best big studio movie of 2003.
B000002GQE|5.0|Some things never change.  One thing that doesn't change is our day to day grind of life.  This album takes us through an entire day.  It's fun to sit and listen to this one all the way through.  Amazing lyrics and music create a vivid imagery.  A fantastic concept album.  <br />This one goes in my top 10 of all time for myself.  It's one the few albums I can listen to from start to finish.  It's also one of the few concept albums that was actually good.
B00005JMEW|4.0|As I understand it, \\"Kill Bill\\" was originally planned as one movie. When director Quentin Tarantino announced that the finished product would run nearly three hours, the distributor, Miramax Films, had an aneurysm - in today's short attention span society, an audience would never sit through a movie of that length. A compromise was agreed to: \\"Kill Bill\\" would be split into two parts. Thus, \\"Kill Bill, Vol. 1\\" is only half of a movie. Luckily, the ever resourceful Tarantino was able to engineer the split so that \\"Vol. 1\\" is itself a superlative treat. [The main problem in dividing the movie into two parts may be that it allows each part to go on a bit too long. The combined length of the two parts is now 3 hours and 41 minutes.]<br />In the first volume, The Bride [Uma Thurman] wakes up from a coma. Her last memories are of being ambushed on her wedding day, when she was the only one in the wedding party to survive a group of assassins. She vividly remembers who they were and sets out to kill all of them. In this part of the movie, she dispatches two of five. In the next part, we assume she finds the other three. <br />The trick to enjoying \\"Kill Bill\\" has to do with not taking it seriously. The movie turns comic book characters into live performances. There is violence galore and lots of blood, but it is not meant to be taken literally. It's a cult thing - either you get it or you don't. If you get it, it's a lot of fun. If you don't, it's gross and stupid.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I'd heard this cd was coming out months before it did.  And I, like so many reviewers, jumped on amazon and bought it on day one.  <br />Good to excellent in most places, and in fact, anything without the recently indicted Mr. Spector's Wallofsound sound is a joy (don't you just wish George had done a scrub of All Things Must Pass?).<br />Speaking of George...Paul, what were you thinking (picture Dr. Phil)????  The guitar solo on Let It Be on the original album is one of the best in rock.  So, Paul...still intent on letting your own little light shine?  Do a re-release and put that magic back in.
B0000C0FJB|4.0|This is the only other live rush cd I've heard beside All the World's a Stage. There some good live performances on this and some forgettable one's, too. I think some of the newer material like earthshine, secret touch, come off very well here. Vital Signs while supposedly being a bootleg version maybe the most outstanding perfomance on the live cd. Lime light is one song that doesn't come off too well. La Villa Stranglato starts out great then someone other than Geddy comes in and starts singing and screws up a good performance. The Pass is another well performed song on here. I have a hard time listening to closer to the heart live period because it's such a great studio song. The Spirit of the Radio is another well performed song. It varies with each song..I don't have any other live cd's beside the aforementioned two of theirs so I don't don't know how they compare to other live cd's. By Tor and the Snow dog is one I prefer from All the World's a Stage. I traded for this so I don't know if I should tell you to get it if you several other Rush live cd's or not.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|The DVD shows why corporate geniuses are not always geniuses in public office.  The man 'understood' the Vietnam war in 'input and output' terms.  Up to this day, he cannot bring himself to look into the abys and recognize all the suffering that this managerial qualities brought onto the Vietnamese people.  A man eager to 'serve' and dishonest with his legacy.
B000069HK2|4.0|All I have to say is that this is a great album. I like how theres not one song that sounds similar to the one before it. All the songs are great but my personal favorite is &quot;Blue and Yellow.&quot; I would recommend this CD to anyone looking for a great album that wont get old. I also recommend the &quot;Maybe Memories&quot; CD/DVD, it has a documentry on the band, showing you what they went through to get where they are now, as well as some live footage and all there music videos.
B00000J7RZ|2.0|Jennifer Lopez has had so much hype but only after her debut portraying murdered Selena Quintanilla-Perez in 1997.  Since, she's risen with help of some mediocre films (the only REAL performance she's given is in SELENA) and a slew of hot-to-not albums.  Lopez's vocals haven't done any better either, and it's obvious to most people that this girl can't really sing.  Now don't get me wrong, I really enjoy &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot; and some other J to tha' Lo songs, but this debut is a medicore release from an ACTRESS - she isn't a SINGER, people!  Singing is only another way her publicists found they could make more money off of her.  We need to remember that.  ON THE 6 is a lukewarm CD from a girl who could probably win a few karaoke contests, but nothing else.  Jenny from the Block?!  Not likely.  It's also obvious she's forgotten her roots, too.  Jennifer is on the demise since her breakup with Affleck in January.  When she chooses the right songs I like them but when she doesn't, it's really hard to listen to her.  The only tracks that stand out on ON THE 6 are &quot;If I Had Your Love&quot; and &quot;Waiting&quot;, and none of them became hits on her account; the song has that hit-quality, but her voice doesn't.  Sorry, Lopez.  Your first in a slew of medicore albums.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|If you do not have a taste for pop, i do not see why you should be here bitching about Britney Spears's 'In the zone'. <BR>There's some good music in here and yes, do not judge the album by its cover. Sure, everyone will stick up their noses when they see Brit's name on it. But this CD happens to contain some great pop music with flavours of rnb and hiphop. There is a big variety of music here including a touch of chinese, indian, reggae, southern, classic club, pure club and even a couple of good ballads.<BR>Pick it up now if you happen to be a pop fan.
B00005JM02|5.0|My wife and I viewed this with our 6 year-old daughter and we ALL had a BLAST!!! The music, art, and animation was WONDERFUL! This is definitely a movie to get for the family DVD collection! My HIGHEST FAMILY Recommendation!
B00006FDCD|4.0|I remember watching this movie when it first aired on tv. I was about 10 at the time. Since watching it, i have always been a little afraid of clowns. I thought it was the scariest movie ever and i always had frightening images in my mind of pennywise the clown. However, i just recently watched the movie again. Now that i am a little older i actaully found this movie to be quite funny. Tim Curry  plays the role of the clown too perfectly, and as a result his performance is actually funnier than it is scary. The library scene made me laugh out loud.<BR>This movie is only scary if you are a kid. If you are an adult and find this movie scary than you are a sissy.<BR>As far as the plot goes . . .considering the circumastances i think they did a good job with this movie. There are a lot of people complaning but what did they expect? They tried to fit a 1000 page book by Stephen King into 3 hours .. so of course they had to leave out some scenes. And keep in mind that this was a made for tv movie from 1990 with a limited budget. I wish they make this movie again . ..this time make it longer (4-6 hours) so that there could be better character development and a proper plot line. On a side note i actually live in the same city where they filmed most of the scenes. In case you are wondering .. the Paramount theatre is an actaul place but it is a strip club :).
B0000TB01Y|4.0|A friend commented to me that while the women in this musical shine, &quot;the men suck&quot;.  I wouldn't be quite that harsh, but the reason to get this disc is to hear Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth.  They both sound absolutely fantastic, and the orchestrations are lush.  At times funny, at times heartbreaking, this is the must have cd from Broadway this season.  Some of the lyrics are a little pedestrian, but the ladies overcome that easily.  And this musical is not nearly as dark as the book.  This is definately the best musical to come along since Thoroughly Modern Millie.
B000003S0B|4.0|Like many reviewers before me have already said, King Crimson's second album, 1970's &quot;In The Wake Of Poseidon,&quot; sounds very much like a retread of their classic first album, &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King.&quot; At least, the first half does. Was Robert Fripp &amp; company short on material and/or ideas? Could be, but it may have been mostly because &quot;Poseidon&quot; shows King Crimson in a state of transition, so the band may have been pressed for time in coming up with new stuff. Bassist/vocalist Greg Lake only had enough time to contribute vocals to the album, as he was about to join Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, so Peter Giles played bass for the recording, while Gordon Haskell contributes a guest vocal on &quot;Cadence And Cascade,&quot; and he would carry on as lead vocalist and bassist for Crimson's next album, &quot;Lizard.&quot; Still, this IS King Crimson were talking about here, and &quot;In The Wake Of Poseidon&quot; is still an excellent Crimson album, filled with the band's trademark tough-as-nails progressive rock and atmospheric tranquility. First up is the &quot;Son of The Crimson King&quot; material. Following the quiet, serene opener, &quot;Peace: A Beginning,&quot; is &quot;Pictures Of A City,&quot; a basic re-write of &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man,&quot; all the way down to Fripp's fiery guitar solos, the kinetic instrumental bridge, and the use of saxophone. Still, it's great rockin' stuff. &quot;Cadence And Cascade&quot; is practically the twin song of &quot;I Talk To The Wind,&quot; but, like it's more famous brother, it's a lovely song. And the title track is more or less a clone of &quot;Epitaph,&quot; but considering it's equally dreamy sounds &amp; feel, I'm not gonna complain about it.The second half of &quot;Poseidon&quot; kicks off with a beautiful bit of Fripp solo guitar, &quot;Peace: A Theme,&quot; before giving way to &quot;Cat Food,&quot; an awesome progressive jazz/rock fusion number that points in the direction that Crimson would take on their next album, &quot;Lizard&quot; (Keith Tippet contributes excellent piano to this track, and, like Gordon Haskell, he too would be back for &quot;Lizard&quot;). Then comes &quot;The Devil's Triangle,&quot; a classic Crimson freak-out instrumental, followed by the tranquil calm after the storm, &quot;Peace: An End,&quot; to close out the album.Even though the first half of the album sounds like a duplicate of it's predecessor, &quot;In The Wake Of Poseidon&quot; is still, admittedly, powerful King Crimson. Robert Fripp is a rock guitar/mellotron genius, it's great to hear Greg Lake sing for Crimson one last time (and hear Gordon Haskell's debut), and the band's performances, including Peter Giles on bass, Michael Giles on drums, and Mel Collins on sax and flute, are outstanding. And in my book, that's good enough for me.
B0000D96NW|5.0|After &quot;Supercharger&quot; I though for sure that this band was a goner.  I was even skeptical about this CD at first until I heard Imperium &amp; Bite the Bullet.  If you liked &quot;The More Things Change...&quot; (their best CD by the way) then you will love &quot;Though the Ashes of Empires&quot;.   It is almost unheard of for a band who that has gone as close to the brink as Machine Head to return with such a vengeance.  This CD is simply put one of the best pure metal releases in recent memory - - the heavy, aggressive sound has returned.  Rob Flynn has returned to form, and while I don't know who the new guitarist is, his style sounds a whole lot like Logan Mader.  It sound like he is even using the same equipment, but who cares, the riffs are amazing.<br />If you are too angry &amp; bitter over &quot;The Burning Red&quot; and &quot;Supercharger&quot; to give this CD a chance, then you are truly missing out on a great CD.  Lets just hope that the fans support this album enough so that Machine Head can keep going at this level.
0345349571|4.0|\\"A Distant Mirror\\" is about as entertaining as a history book can get. Barbara Tuchman is a captivating storyteller, and it speaks for the quality of her narrative history of France in the 14th century that the book remains in print after 25 years.<br />The red thread that runs through her book is the folly, pride and irrationality of behavior that she sees as characteristically human: \\"For mankind is ever the same and nothing is lost out of nature, though everything is altered,\\" as the quote from John Dryden says on one of the first pages of the book. The title itself reflects this philosophical position: the 14th century as a distant mirror for the 20th century. To be honest, I found this a bit far-fetched. The two centuries do not share that many similarities. Of course, human nature as such has not changed in the course of six centuries, and the madness of the two world wars is comparable to that of the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453). But the 20th century, for example, saw no epidemic like the plague that killed off more than one third of the population; on the contrary, the discovery of penicillin in 1928 and its application as an injectable drug in 1941 improved the chances of surviving a serious illness dramatically. More importantly, the 20th century did not see the first signs of disintegration of an established political order that would later give rise to a new one (the replacement of feudalism by the nation state); on the contrary, democratic states successfully withstood the challenge from totalitarian systems.<br />Where the book really shines, is the narrative. Barbara Tuchman gives a vivid and detailed picture of life in the 14th century, in particular the life of the nobility. She does not leave out the scandals or the slaughter of battles, the machinations of nobles greedy for power and the suffering of the peasants. Her style is descriptive and detailed. She does not simply tell that, say, realism was the desired effect of miracle plays and mysteries staged for the populace in the 14th century, she shows it in unforgettable detail: \\"When John the Baptist was decapitated, the actor was whisked away so cunningly in exchange for a fake corpse and fake head spilling ox blood that the audience shrieked in excitement.\\"(311/312) Her style is also not without the occasional wink at the reader. A fine example for her subtle sense of humor is the list of possessions of the Duc de Berry (famous for the illustrated book \\"Les Tres Riches Heures\\" he commissioned): \\"He owned one of Charlemagne's teeth, a piece of Elijah's mantle, Christ's cup from the Last Supper, drops of the Virgin's milk, enough of her hairs and teeth to distribute as gifts, soil from various Biblical sites, a narwhal's teeth, [and some more unique curiosities]\\"(427).<br />While I found the story telling absolutely captivating, there are two things about \\"A Distant Mirror\\" that made me choose four rather than five stars. One is the lack of analysis, the other Ms. Tuchman's occasional lapses into pop psychology.<br />The peripheral role of analysis in the book is perhaps a consequence of her narrative style. While Ms. Tuchman feasts on descriptions and details, she does not really want to dwell on the technicalities of changes in technology (other than those in the art of battle), medicine and economics, or on theories that try to put these developments in a broader perspective. At its worst, the reluctance to use analytical tools produces a kind of historical mysticism: \\"Times were to grow worse over the next fifty-odd years [after 1400] until at some imperceptible moment, by some mysterious chemistry, energies were refreshed, ideas broke out of the mold of the Middle Ages into new realms, and humanity found itself redirected.\\"(581)<br />The lapses into pop psychology happen when Ms. Tuchman generalizes; for example, when she concludes, \\"Human beings of any age need to approve of themselves, the bad times in history come when they cannot.\\"(451) Or when\\"pride and folly\\" become driving forces of history, because \\"Vainglory, however, no matter how much medieval Christianity insisted it was a sin, is a motor of mankind, no more eradicable than sex.\\"(577)<br />On the whole, though, \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a pleasure to read, and I am sure the book will continue to find readers who enjoy the colorful and vivid stories Ms. Tuchman unfolds about the \\"calamitous\\" 14th century.n \\"pride and folly\\" become driving forces of history, because \\"Vainglory, however, no matter how much medieval Christianity insisted it was a sin, is a motor of mankind, no more eradicable than sex.\\"(577)<br />On the whole, though, \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a pleasure to read, and I am sure the book will continue to find readers who enjoy the colorful and vivid stories Ms. Tuchman unfolds about the \\"calamitous\\" 14th century.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|There's not much I can add to the reviews of the movie itself, which was spectacular in my opinion.<br />However, it's pretty disappointing that there are no extra features on the DVD.  It's the first DVD I've ever seen without anything extra.  I guess they want you to buy the two-disk collector's set.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Actually, 4.5.  A great album from the Rolling Stones with four classic songs.  I would recommend this album for Gimmie Shelter alone.  The song still sounds amazing and fresh today.  It also has three excellent songs which are not found on many Stones compilations: Let It Bleed, Midnight Rambler and Monkey Man.  The only reason I give it 4.5 stars and not 5 is Country Honk.  Otherwise, a fantastic album and in my opinion, second only to Sticky Fingers in the Rolling Stones catalogue.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|As much as I enjoy a Navy war epic, and appreciate the work that went into the accuracy of this account, I have to admit I found this movie to be otherwise unremarkable.  It's a generic story about a man who is following his orders in the Navy and all the highs and pitfalls associated with his duties.  Russell Crowe is a hottie, always has been, and made the movie even easier to sit through.  I also like the interplay between the Captain and the Doctor, who basically acted as the Captain's conscience in the film.  But we've seen this film before, with other titles.  This was not in any way novel.  As much as I enjoyed it, it is what it is: overrated.
B000000W5L|5.0|Actually, 4.5.  Exile On Main Street is generally considered one of the great rock and roll albums of all time.  I will not disagree.  For talent, ambition, and a &quot;screw it, we'll record what we want&quot; attitude, few albums can top it.  Unfortunately there are a couple of weak songs, and if the down home bluesy aspects of the Rolling Stones aren't your taste, this album can seem a bit long.  I think they did a great job with the sequencing of the tracks, and move deftly between slower numbers and the more up tempo ones.  Exile also has two of the most underated Stones songs, Rocks Off and All Down the Line(Rocks Off probably the most underated).  Personally, I love it and never tire of listening to it, but I can see how it might lack mass appeal.
B00005JLKB|3.0|Smallville caught my attention being aired next to Angel, but as I hate jumping in in the middle, I checked the rave reviews here and on that basis decided to get the dvd.  An important note here is that I'm a Buffy fan - if you are, too, I'm sure you'll find this review quite helpful.  If not, you may want to skip it.  Further, I'm 32, and my other favorite shows are Firefly and Angel, but I also enjoy shows like Six Feet Under, early Ally McBeal and (to some extend) Alias.  I've enjoyed superheroes comics and movies, but I'm not a superman fan.  However, as you can see, the supernatural in fiction appeals to me - though I do find for instance Charmed to be a waste of time - so I thought I might like Smallville a lot.<br />The Good<BR>I like what they've done with Lex Luthor.  He's an interesting character, poised between his corrupt father and wasted youth on one side, and his own aspirations to become a better person helped by his friendship with Clark on the other.  Michael Rosenbaum does a good job portraying him.  His dysfunctional relationship with his father and the power dynamics at Luthor Corp is by far the most interesting story line in the season.<BR>   The first season's structure is basically monster-of-the-week, in many ways similar to Buffy season 1, featuring the mysterious cryptonite rocks instead of the Hellmouth.  Occasionally, the show manages to hit a nerve with the monster, in the same way Buffy did - putting the focus on eating disorders, ignored teens becoming invisible (ring a bell?), etc.<br />The Bad<BR>Smallville season 1 has such similarities with Buffy season 1 that I can't help comparing them: High school superheroes with secret identities fight supernatural evil, helped and sometimes hampered by friends and family.  I think all Smallville's main flaws can be seen more clearly in a comparison between the two.  Smallville is like a thin cup Buffy, being inferior in a number of ways:<BR>- Realistic and/or interesting desciption of the relationship to parents.  Buffy's living alone with her mother, who has her own stressed life, and while she clearly cares about her daughter, she's often having a hard time understanding and communicating with her.  Though Smallville takes place in present days, Clark's parents are taken out of a 50s soap (\\"Father knows best\\" springs to mind), and their problems are so small and superficial that any person actually having experienced their teens will be fighting nausea from time to time.<BR>- Gender roles.  Where Buffy has a strong positive message about girls with guts and strength of will, Smallville's big on the damselling.  The leading lady always keeps her voice down, smiles her little smile and is very accommodating to the various men in her life.  Sometimes you want to slap her.  Clark's best friend, Chloe, is a fountain of fun in comparison, but her part is more the comic sidekick than a rolemodel.<BR>- Acting.  While Buffy had its share of mediocre recurring characters and guest stars, the acting of Smallville's two main characters, Clark Kent and his main love interest Lana Lang, is terrible.  They do improve, as is the rule in television shows, but they're still not quite reaching 'adequate' as the season ends.<BR>- Humor.  Smallville just takes itself a little too serious.  I sorely missed the clever wit of Buffy.<BR>- Character.  As you can perhaps already tell from my comments on Superman's parents, there's just a little too much rosy Little house on the Priarie for this season to be truly compelling.  Their adventures don't seem to last any lasting mark on these kids.  They're just as well adapted and happy as they always were - the contrast to the much more serious problems the scooby gang from Buffy have is notable.  There are some hints that Clark feels uncomfortable with his powers, notably in an episode where he loses them.  However, there's no real indication of why that is - he's using his strength and speed to help out at the farm, doesn't have any hard training to do, nobody seems particularly intent on killing him, so all in all the worst part is that he has to keep them secret.<BR>- Redemption.  Another positive message in the Buffy/Angel verse is that redemption while never easy is always possible.  In Smallville, the characters are all goody good guys with loving relatives and no real troubles to speak of, with Lex being the only grey character - and we all know how he'll end up.  Not much room left for free will.<br />In Conclusion<BR>I had actually made up my mind not to get season 2, but as season 1 ended with a cliffhanger, and seeing that there's unanimous agreement that season 2 is better than season 1 showing us more of the interesting Luthors, I ended up getting it anyway - so there were clearly some things I enjoyed in season 1 of Smallville.  A thin cup Buffy may still be quite nice.  Lots of teenagers love this series, but to anyone older I think you need to be a genre fan to really get into Smallville season 1.
B000000W5N|5.0|The best of all the Stones Albums.  This record is solid from top to bottom.  Every song is great.  It has a wonderful diversity of styles and great pacing.  I may be biased as this was the first Rolling Stones I owned, but I think it's quality is undeniable.  Not as country as Beggar's Banquet, as straight ahead as Let it Bleed, or bluesy as Exile, this is the album where the Stones took all their styles and melded them together to create a distinctive sound and mood.  Plus, it has by far the coolest cover(if your old enough to remember the vinyl with the zipper).
B00005JMEW|1.0|I am giving the movie only 1 star because of the domestic DVD version of this film.  BEWARE!!  The movie itself is an awesome film.  However, the Japanese release and DVD contain far more detail.  Not only is the Japanese version 3 minutes longer, but the Yakuza fight scene is filmed entirely in COLOR.  Furthermoe, the Japanese version contains the graphic trunk dismemberment scene of Uma cutting off the other arm of the assistant.  The Japanese DVD contains all the same features, and much more!  Don't be fooled by the domestic release!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Terrible nonsense, which could be forgiven if it was any fun at all to watch, but it isn't. Sad.
B00005JN0A|5.0|One of the great fun cult classics of the new century.   I would expect that this will sell tons of copies in the DVD market.<br />Matt Mumford
B00006CXXU|2.0|The name of this album should have been Exploited, not Stripped.  Christina is probably the most talented singer out there today but this album and her new image is so over the top.  I think her image really downplays her talent, which is why I rate the album low.  Musically, I think she improved a lot since her first release.  Dirrty is a great song that makes you want to get up and move.  But after I saw the video once, images of her a** in chaps and gyrating in the water was all I could think of when I heard it.  Then I had to see her nude, what 2, 3 times on magazine covers?  I think if Christina could tone it down just a notch she could really appeal to a larger audience.  I'm not saying anything drastic, just a notch.  And maybe Christina doesn't care about that, but what is she trying to prove?  <BR>The album is definitely a move to a more adult audience and I think her talent really shined through on that.  Songs like Beautiful and Fighter were a positive change from her former &quot;poppy&quot; image.
B0000DJZ8R|2.0|For years I heard what a magnificent film THE GRAPES OF WRATH was. Perhaps the build-up was too much, and I expected a masterpiece. It isn't. Fonda and Jane Darwell give good performances, but the film feels wooden and dull most of the time.<br />Fox's presentation also leaves something to be desired. The print is not up to the kind of restoration a film with this reputation would seem to warrant. Further, the extras are pitiful for what is supposed to be a &quot;special edition&quot;. A particularly banal and recycled A&amp;E biography is supposed to be the highlight. The &quot;expert&quot; commentary is by a film historian who gets his facts wrong. (In discussing Henry Fonda's lost Oscar to James Stewart, he says that Stewart lost the year before to Clark Gable in GWTW, when in fact Stewart lost to Robert Donat). You'd think an authoritative commentator would do his homework!<br />I'm sorry I wasted my money on this one.
B000003AEB|5.0|Following the success of 1992's \\"The Chronic\\", the unstoppable duo of Dr. Dre and newcomer Snoop Doggy Dogg quickly got to work on Snoop's debut album, \\"Doggystyle\\". Many critics wondered if the charismatic youngster from Long Beach could stand out by himself with his own name on the album cover. All the doubters were quickly silenced as Snoop dropped what would be considered one of the hottest debut albums ever.<br />With production work handled entirely by Dr. Dre, \\"Doggystyle\\" is one of those albums that to this day, ten years after its release, can still be played the whole way through. Not only has its production been imitated by countless producers but Snoop's rhymes on this album have been sampled by every emcee from Jay-Z to Eminem. With classic party joints like the hit singles, \\"What's My Name?\\" and \\"Gin & Juice\\", Snoop proved that despite his reputation as a so-called \\"gangsta\\" rapper, he could still make songs to turn a party out. While this album has been influential to many rappers, Snoop himself was clearly influenced by different artists from P-Funk pioneer George Clinton to rap storytellers like Slick Rick as he shows on the laid-back \\"Lodi Dodi\\". Snoop also brings his crew along with him as Tha Dogg Pound's Kurupt and Daz showcase their chemistry on \\"Serial Killa\\" and \\"For All My (...)\\". Kurupt's verse on \\"Ain't No Fun\\" is as equally classic as partner Nate Dogg's crooning. Snoop drops what is actually a freestyle on \\"Tha Shiznit\\" and he never misses a beat. The classic \\"Doggy Dogg World\\" brings the very best from everyone involved. Dre's production along with verses from Snoop, Daz, and Kurupt is the stuff that hit records are made of. The chorus from The Dramatics is the perfect finishing touch to it all.<br />I don't need to tell you what a classic album \\"Doggystyle\\" is. Its record sales and critical praise speak for itself. If you don't have this LP, you need to go out and get it. If you can find the ultra-rare first print that contains \\"G'z Up, Hoes Down\\", you better grab that as well. \\"Doggystyle\\" was the perfect follow-up to \\"The Chronic\\". The same young roster of future superstars came back to show that it wasn't no fluke.p, Hoes Down\\", you better grab that as well. \\"Doggystyle\\" was the perfect follow-up to \\"The Chronic\\". The same young roster of future superstars came back to show that it wasn't no fluke.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|You'll be &quot;over the rainbow&quot; with this exquisite double-disc set featuring Vincente Minnelli's masterful 1944 classic MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS. Judy Garland was at her finest here, and the presentation given to the film on this DVD is simply stunning. The TECHNICOLOR images have never been more vivid and sharp, and the sound is simply staggering in its clarity! Never have I heard a 60 year old film sound so clear and crisp!<br />The extras are impressive, as is always the case with Warner Bros.' fine double disc editions.<br />Anyone who isn't dazzled by this DVD needs to get glasses!
1592400876|5.0|As a homeschooling mom I wanted to brush up on my grammar skills.  This is the book that every homeschooling parent should read.  Its not only educational but quite entertaining.  You will enjoy the sense of humor in the book.  It's also a great book for your high school student to brush up on their punctuation.  A must for any homeschooling family library!!!
B000056IKS|5.0|For those of you who are not familiar with Neu!, they're a duo from Dusseldorf, Germany. Neu! is made up of two outstanding guitarists Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother. The two created three cosmically wonderful ground breaking lp's between 1971-75. This is their self-titled debut originally put out in 1971. 'Neu!' starts off with &#34;Hallogallo&#34;, that's ten solid minutes of pure brain floating magic. Some weird sound effects and monitored feedback are combined in &#34;Sonderangebot&#34;. Then there's &#34;Weissensee&#34; that is TRUE progressive krautrock. &#34;Im Gluck&#34; is seven minutes of more superb feedback with sound effects of water and seagulls nearby, unreal!&#34; Negativland&#34; tends to show case Neu's industrial side. Needless to say, a brilliant lp and that was produced by the legendary record producer Conny Plank. Totally ignore the rather primitive cover art. As it turns out, Neu! has been an influence on several of today's artists such as Stereolab, Sonic Youth, late '70's David Bowie, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Johnny Rotten. Highly Recommended.
9700512479|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have jet read and if you are a person looking for self-improvement this is it! WOW so many thing happen in this book some of you will find your self identified with the main caractor. It's just INCREDABLE!!!!!
B000056IKU|4.0|Nice follow up to the band's first lp, originally released in 1972, having eleven tracks. I was impressed with the fluid dynamics of \\"Fur Immer\\" (meaning 'Forever') and with the somewhat trend setting industrial \\"Spitzenqualitat\\". I notice that this reissue tends to change moods more often than the first one did. Apparently, Rother and Dinger stuck a bunch of fillers on 'Neu! 2' (I heard they ran out of funds during the middle of the lp's recording session) that were previously released with the speeds altered, which are \\"Neuschnee 78\\",\\"Super 16\\" and the 78 rpm-sounding \\"Super 78\\". Clever. Don't worry about your CD player, it's fine. Several stops,skips,etc here and there. \\"Hallo Excentrico\\" and \\"Super\\" are probably the best remixes. Certain fans of experimental just MAY find themselves drooling over this title.
B00006RINF|5.0|This album is awsome!!!!! the first time i heard HEAVEN'S A LIE i fell in LOVE with Critina Scabbia's voice. After hearing the rest of the album i was please with all their songs.  I would totally recommend the album.  This is the best album i've heard.
B000002H2H|5.0|I picked up a copy of Metallica's Ride the Lightning when I was just 12 years old.  I got it mainly because it had a awesome looking cover.  Once I listened to it though, it became my favorite album by Metallica or anyone else for that matter.  It was ahead of its time when it came out in 1984.  Metallica wrote these songs not simply interested in speed and agression, but also in melody and epic song structures and dynamics.  Listen to the album the whole way through to understand its power and greatness.<br />Fight Fire With Fire(9/10)- The first song has a very happy classical sounding intro.  It ends, and builds up into a very brutal opening riff.  The song is played fast and angry, but then again, you cant write a calm song about nuclear apocalypse.<BR>   <BR>Ride the Lightning(10/10)- They slow down the tempo a bit, but none of the aggression is lost on this track.  This song, about a person being executed in the electric chair has a very strong, shout-along chorus.  It also has one of the best guitar solos ever.<br />For Whom the Bell Tolls(8/10)- A good song, but not as good as the others on the album.  Its pretty slow actually.  Definetly worth listening to.  Cool subject matter.<br />Fade to Black(10/10)- Very good stuff here.  It has something for everybody.  Kind of a power ballad almost, but not poppy at all.  More excellent guitars exemplify the pain of the song's subject.<br />Trapped Under Ice(10/10)- This song blew my mind away the first time I heard it.  If your a fan of thrash and speed metal, this is the song for you.  Super fast.  Kirk Hammett really showcases his talent for leads on this one.  His solo is just so crazy and intense, its incredible.<br />Escape(9/10)- Some people including James Hetfield really dont like this song.  I dont understand why.  Its not the best, but its a very self-impowering kind of song with a strong chorus.<br />Creeping Death(10/10)- This is an awesome song.  Its about Moses and the plauges of Egypt.  Once again, great solos.  The song is so epic and huge sounding.  The feel is amazing.  Just listen to it.<br />The Call of Ktulu(9/10)- Good intrumental, but could have been a little shorter than it is. Dont get me wrong, i like long songs, its just this one kind of runs out of ideas.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Tragic Kingdom is one of my favorite CDS of all time, so I'm probably a bit biased. I love this CD however. The dance beats of Hella Good, and Hey Baby, are perfect for any party or to just blast in the car. Definitely recommended!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I brought alicia's album with a little hast, i had liked the last two singles but had heard that her album was more a relax album (which i think is always good for the fast living of today)so i started listening to it and found that it was becoming my favourate album of the year. With many of the songs being favourite. i suggest that you go and buy it because allthough it has a few slow songs it also has cool fast songs that i find to be easy listening. This album appeals to ALL if you are interested!!!
B00006LWSF|5.0|This is one of my my favorite Hip-Hop album ever. It has a great mix of excellent Mcs, and great production. It has a few songs that are EXTREMELY GOOD. Its rare to find an album with this many songs that good. However, it does have some weak songs, but they dont take it down too much to the point it isnt worth buying. This album is 5+ stars. One thing its missing is Dr Dre, if he was on it (instead of Macy Gray or Boomkat) it may have pushed it over the top as the best ever.<br />Songs:<BR>1. Lose Yourself (Eminem) 4.5/5 Great Song, but overplayed<BR>2. Love Me (Eminem-ObieTrice-50Cent) 4/5 Em, Obie &amp; 50 on one track is good mix<BR>3. 8 Mile (Eminem) 3/5 Good Song, but too long<BR>4. Adrenaline Rush 5/5 BEST SONG, great beat by Dr Dre<BR>5. Places to Go (50 Cent) 4/5<BR>6. Rap Game (D-12) 5/5 Another GREAT song. Better than anything on Devils Night or D-12 World<BR>7. 8 Mile &amp; Running (Jay-Z &amp; Freeway) 3/5<BR>8. Spitshine (Xzibit) 5/5 Another one of my All-Time Favs<BR>9. Time of My Life (Macy Gray) 1/5 SUX. This spot wouldve been perfect for a Dr Dre song, but NOOOO! they waste it on Macy<BR>10. U Wanna Be Me (Nas) 5/5 Tight song. Nas rips it up.<BR>11. Wanksta (50 Cent) 4/5 Catchy beat, good lyrics.<BR>12. Wasting My Time (Boomkat) 1/5 Another weak point<BR>13. RAKIM (Rakim) 2/5 Not too great<BR>14. Thats My N***a fo Real (Young Zee) 3/5<BR>15. Battle (Gangstarr) 3/5<BR>16. Rabbit Run (Eminem) 5/5 No hook, just blazing hot Em rap tearin it up<BR>DELUXE EDITION (Disc 2) ALSO INCLUDES:<BR>1. Rap Name (Obie Trice) 5/5 Obie's First Single<BR>2.

B00005A1PR|5.0|What can I say about this album that is not already said. Bought this album when it came out in 2001 and I pick it up a week ago and put it in my cd player and wow!!! I got to say a calmness and freshness came over me like the album had just release a week ago. The freshness is still there, a Classic album and the grammys did her an injustice when they nominated her for 7 grammys and in turn gave her no award for her beautiful and distinctive work. She is not the prototype of todays artist who shakes A$$ and bling out in fake diamonds. Her words from her albums exubes the beautiful black woman that she is --humble,spiritual and talented. You will NOT--let me emphasize that a little more you will NOT skip any track on this album, hence you will not be dissapointed. She is the female Maxwell with a mixture of Tracy Chapman creative writing. Just imagine that picture in your mind and go out and GET THIS ALBUM ALOMG WITH &quot;VOYAGE TO iNDIA&quot;       MY Favorite TRACKS THAT YOU WILL LOVE      1)BROWN SKIN ( a concept that exubes beauty and self confidence of love the skin that you are in --melow with a touch of R&B)      2)Video---describe exactly how people like myself view the music videos today (a True song about the real sistas/young ladys carry themselves in a positive light)       3) I see God in You--The title speaks for itself      4)Ready for love- woooo --one thing you need to do is turn everything off around you a listen to the words of this song and you will be amazed of this singer/songwriter creative genius      5)Promises-- laid back relax and listen      6)&quot;Beautiful&quot; & &quot;Strength Courage and Wisdom&quot;, is very uplifting       7)The rest I can't list cause words will do no justice to this album and final thought she is not the BRitneys BEyonces, Christina etc, and that to me is very uplifting because she is the essence of a true artist. The nusic should speak for itself and people like MTV should recognize that and stop promote artist that a purely based image. Thats the reason artist like her don't last long on the music scene beacuse that don't get the deserved promtion they need to keep they career alive and that is ashame. GET THIS ALBUM She had a far better album than Alicia Keys: A minor but the grammys went with the &quot;prototype&quot;(I not going to get deep or prolific on that statement but you can read through the lines
0064471837|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend after she had raved about it, and within a few pages, I was sucked in. The fantasy was extremely well-written, with a curious ease that makes the whole Charter world seem real. The characters are easily admired and captivated me from the start. Sabriel wins my award for best High Fantasy novel of the year. It's worth spending $8 on, for sure.
B000003ER4|4.0|Korngold wrote this in his early 20's and never matched it. It is traditional, experimental, wonderfully colored, theatrically dramatic and sweetly lyric. Puccinian, Straussian, personally idiosyncratic. Listening to it again after several years, it has lost none of the shine, the delight.<br />More importantly, this recording offers one of the lamentably few recorded performances of Carol Neblett.  It remains one of the mysteries of show-biz how this marvelous (and gorgeous) singer never really achieved Grand Star status.  Another mystery never to be solved is why Rene Kollo was cast here. Neblett had been appearing in the '70's (at New York City Opera, and elsewhere) with the equally astonishing (and likewise short-shrifted) John Alexander, who'd been singing Paul at least since the mid '60's.(A '67 Munich tape with him may exist, but I've never heard it.) Too bad, but even if one were to hate the music, and find Kollo really a downer, the set is worth having for C.N. alone.
0385335482|5.0|I don't usually read fiction...a &quot;waste of time&quot; when I could be reading about the 'real' world or 'improving myself'...something actually useful.  But when I read this series recommended by some younger friends, I was immediately hooked.  Maybe I can see me in Becky...&quot;me&quot; to the extreme.  Or maybe she is just a believable, likeable, hysterically imaginative character.  I was totally entertained and sad when I finished the series.  Yes, it's light, ridiculous, and just plain FUN! Can't wait for a movie--who would be good to play Becky?
B000089RVX|5.0|All you need to hear is one of the first three songs and you will want to buy this CD. I first heard this it from one of my friends and I couldn't get enough of Evanescence. One word of advise, don't bother to read the reviews, just buy the CD!!!!!!
B00008HCCF|4.0|I'm going to make this one short. This DVD is very very very intense. It is incredible that Norah and her band are able to execute so agressively at such a low stage volume. It blows me away. The film is okay and it's fun to watch, but I am very captivated by the ability and talent of the group to deliver such intensity at subtle levels. I wish more groups in the popular music arena would be able to deliver such stellar results. The engineering is pretty damn good, and even though the songs are 'quiet' and 'subtle', i recommend that you crank the hell outta this DVD and listen to the subtle nuisiances. The upright bass is captured nicely. The drums are killer as well, I'm a fan of the sound they captured. Good job guys! Not to mention, I enjoy the way Norah has a knack for her slinky timing. I would die to hear more keyboardist have the ability to 'slide' in time the way she does. Kudos Norah! You have won my applause. Your talent makes me sick, but in a good way. I don't want to step out on a limb, but I think the timing and execution of the band as an ensemble is pretty stellar... maybe for Norah it is genetic to have an aptitude for a good internal clock, having a dad who is a sick tabla performer. Her drummer is very expressive as well, he uses some mallets and his brush work is creative and I think the engineering of this DVD does it capturing his style and technique justice... Hell, the whole band is damn good and I am glad i picked this one up. (...).  Like I said crank this DVD up and let it roar, you will learn a lot about intensity and how it is possible to play quiet and intense. It would be a great learning tool for younger musicians and if i was still teaching music, I would probably use this as a reference. All I can say is this is one intense group and getting to see them up close and observe them utilize thier instruments is pretty damn cool. <br />Let me iterate again... Even though this ensemble might not appear to have the testicular fortitiude ofa group such as Korn (i know its like comparing apples and oranges he he)... I would argue and suggest that those not usually atune to 'quiter' music take note and realize that this performance is actually more intense than the majority of groups in popular music. Maybe it has something to do with the BlueNote connection... i dunno... <BR>just my two cents, since everyone else has great comments...
B000002H1T|2.0|It was with great anticipation that I bought Heartbeat City back in 1984, and, though I was somewhat pleased with the commercial recognition the band received, I vowed then that it was the last album of theirs that I would buy.  I never bothered to purchase their follow-up to Heartbeat City.<br />Too commercial.  Too Pop.  The Cars lost whatever &quot;edge&quot; they had with this album, though Shake It Up was a premonition in this regard as the group moved toward the mainstream.  They were neither smart nor funny anymore....and became another MTV-friendly pop act.  <br />Some of the songs are catchy, but the overall effect is flat.  Ocasek's love of the studio is ever-present, and the album probably would have been improved if he'd actually allowed all the group's members to play during its recording.  <br />I label Heartbeat City as a letdown for fans of The Cars from their beginnings, though I'm sure the 12 year olds back in '84 loved it.
B0001I55OC|1.0|They completely destroyed an excellent book. I reread the book for the 5th time or so last week, and I couldn't get this horrible movie out of my mind. They plot was torn to shreds, they left out at least 80% of it. The book gave the characters depth, the movie didn't. The book gave plausible explanations for everything. The movie came up with some stupid explanation that had little to do with the book. In the book, they could go to anywhere they wanted, in cage-like machines that they could summon. Little pendants with a button? Phft.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|The whole film just felt like a waste of time. What was the moral of the story? Many scenes were done with beautiful photography and some of the car chases were great. Maybe I just missed the point of it?
6305907145|1.0|Any one who is inclined to care about Jane Austin's wonderful characters would not care for this Fanny. She is unrelated to the Fanny in Mansfield Park, and the movie is altogether an insult to Jane Austin.<br />Want to make a movie? Great, but don't steal a famous book, write your own plot entirely and slap it together. That's a cheap publicity stunt.

B0000630BT|5.0|Priest rules!!!! Although they weren't off to a great start with the unbeLIEVABLY bad Rocka Rolla, they continued on from there with 13 more records, all of which were good. And this, their last album with Rob Halford (until now), is their best by far. Everything about it is good. Let us review the tunes.<br />1. Painkiller<br />The best track Priest ever recorded! The riffs are killer, as is the drum intro, and Rob is screaming at the top of his lungs. I bought it for this song, and loved the rest of the album, too.<br />2-8: Hell Patrol, All Guns Blazing, Leather Rebel, Metal Meltdown, Night Crawler, Between The Hammer &amp; The Anvil, Touch of Evil<br />I'll have to say that no songs shred like the title track, but they all have great riffs and the lyrics are very Priest-like, not the lousy ones on the song Parental Guidance (still a good song, though) or the good-but-corny ones on Jugulator and Demolition (the studio albums that would follow this and feature vocalist Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens).<br />9 &amp; 10: Battle Hymn, One Shot At Glory<br />Battle Hymn is a good 39 second prelude to the extravagant closer.<br />Bonus Tracks: Not worth it, I never listen to them.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This album is inhumanly good. A marble lightning bolt across the sky. A permanent global landmark. More honest than any other album out there. More wise and beautiful than a Booker winner. And infinitely, soul-wreckingly generous.<br />There is none higher.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|In regards to the folks that bought this DVD and had problems with the sound, I have had no problems with the sound in any way.  I have a surround system and think the sound is of the finest quality.  I even disconnected the surround and played it through my T.V. and still no audio problems.  It might be nice if it was remastered in Dolby 5.1, but It sounded great regardless, especially the video Estranged.  I think these folks should get their equipment checked instead of blaming it on the disk.
B00008J4P5|5.0|The liner notes say that this album is dedicated to the memory of the seetheart. Seems the seetheart has died. Who dunnit? You need look no further than... --Jack White.<br />Yes, Jack killed the sweetheart. He play acts like he's a sensitive man, but you know he's not. He gets in fistfights in bars. He thanks Swank magazine (on White Blood Cells). And gets into threesomes with Holly Golightly and Meg, his erstwhile, devoted and loving (though none-too-bright) sister. One can only wonder at poor Meg's feelings.<br />That's right. Jack White is a PIG.<br />On the other hand... this album fairly ROCKS OUT. A must-have for those of us who know Bon Scott is dead, but his spirit lives on.
031286504X|2.0|Kind of a combination of Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula.  I was so not ready for the ending I kept turning the page, like what happened.  It just ends, that's it?  I didn't like it at all, although I will say at times I found it disturbing.  Short story material, not a novel.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Your Mom and Dad don't like this music. So you know it's good.<br />The future.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I wanted badly to enjoy this movie, but it was as confusing as the second one.  And the Trinity character had no chemistry with Keanu Reeve's character at all, just blah love plot.  Special effects were neat, if a bit overwhelming, the battle scenes in this one made it much better than the second one.  Jada Pinkett's character was wasted as was Orpheus' character.
B00005B36H|5.0|All sorts of EVIL noises produced here. Crazy syncopations, Iommi/Page riffs and line after line of lyrics about life outside the norm. It's too bad these guys don't do an album a year. I cannot get enough of them.
B0001FR3IG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a wonderful plot and I loved the twists as the mystery unwound.  Cruz was good but her accent was distracting from her character.  The very ending on the street was a poor way to cap off such a good movie.  Halle was terrific, Downey Jr.'s character just disappeared at the end and nothing with them ever wrapped up.
0743216458|5.0|I bought and read this book several years ago, and loved it.  It is an easy read (no pun intended), and really describes the bond between these elite citizen soldiers.  And it is a wonderful homage to these great men.  After buying the DVD series &quot;Band Of Brothers&quot;  I decided to re-read Ambrose's book.  This book was even better the second time around.  True accounts are much better than fiction, and the late Stephen Ambrose will stand as one of the great American historians.  I recommend reading this book, then watching the mini-series and then re-reading the book.  If you were stirred by the mini-series, you will be inspired by the book.
B000002GVO|1.0|Well, you can see that I do not enjoy the Eagles so much... Much on the contrary, I think they are one of the wrost bands ever to appear, making silly commercial songs with no punch, no real talent at all, and even so selling millions and millions of album, in the best &quot;Backstreet Boys, Britney Speasrs, Spice Girls&quot; style...<br />This album is plain bad, awful. The tittle track is a gem that makes you wonder how the same guys who wrote such great tune wrote the obnoxiously bad rest of the songs in this album.
0743243153|5.0|I am writing this review 15 years after reading the book, and living my way through it. This book is a gem, i would not call it self help or even psychology - it is a 'from the heart' message from the author on love, responsibility and life. I felt the message when i read it first and vowed to 'avoid' all the mistakes with regards to love and discipline that the author describes. But there is no shortcut, really. This book has to be lived through, not understood. One or two things for the author (or anyone plannign to write on these lines) - your writing reaches all over, i know people in India who have loved this book and learnt from it (despite the fact that very little psycho therapy is available there), also know therapists who have 'read' it and done nothing else. So it pays to pay attention to the global nature of the audience. Secondly, while Peck does exalt people who have dared to explore themselves in therapy he does mention a line that self esteem, if not realized in childhood is an upward journey, often 'unsuccesful'. He might have meant it in a bigger context (statistical, perhaps) but the comment is highly discouraging to those of us who take the 'upward journey' and yes, we are successful sometimes.
0345452577|1.0|I have not or cannot finish reading this book. It is soooo slooow and seems to be going nowhere and I don't really care about Jeremy at all.  Why is that?  My first experience with Jon Kellerman was so wonderful that I had to read everything right away. But this book can't be his.  I did catch his wonderful descriptive talents in describing scenery but that is not plot.  As with Patricia Cornwell's disaster with Blow Fly, it seems as if two previous reviewers are right. Mr. Kellerman was phoning it in or he had this book from a college project and needed to get something published.  I don't think I will bother finishing The Conspiracy Club so I can use the time to find a new mystery author.  I checked out this site to be sure that I was not the only one who was disappointed.
0940985691|5.0|This is the best book on Vedic Astrology (Jyotish) available in the market today. It provides a very strong foundation for a serious student of Jyotish.    The authors have taken great efforts to explain various aspects of this vast field in a very comprehensive manner. The book is very well organised. It first introduces the reader to the philosophy of Jyotish and how it relates to the Law of Karma and other apsects of Indian thought. I think getting an insight of how jyotish integrates with vedic world view in general is very important for an in depth understanding.    Then it builds on the basics of Jyotish. Grahas, Rashis, Bhavas, Panchanga, Nashaktras and so on. The authors not merely mention the attributes and characterstics of each of these building blocks, but also mention where and how these characterstics could be practically applied while interpreting a horoscope.    For instance, while mentioning the gender of Nakshatras, the authors explain how this knowledge could be used to predict whether a person will be blessed with a baby girl or a boy.    The authors have maintained a  good balance  among traditional Jyotish Principles, the distinctions as taught by their Jyotish Guru and as derived by their own experience.    Trying to learn Jyotish  by directly reading the original Jyotish texts (or their translations) can leave a beginner student quite confused as these texts were not written for students, but, for teachers who would orally transmit this knowledge to their students.    The authors have taken care not just to  reproduce the original texts, but have tried to emulate the oral tradition of teaching Jyotish through their unique approach to the subject and  lucid writing style. I would say, they are pretty successful at that.    After creating a solid foundation on the building blocks of Jyotish, the book moves on to teach how to apply the knowledge of those building blocks to interpret a horoscope. The authors have abstratced eighteen  basic criteria for horoscope interpretation out of a vast sea of documented Jyotish principles. This is simply brilliant and a saving grace for a Jyotish novice like me who was about to drown in the vast sea of innumerable and often contradicting Jyotish principles. In fact, many of these more complex rules can be derived from these eighteen basic criteria.    Then the book moves on to more advanced concepts like Graha Yogas, Dashas and Gocharas. Finally the book has a chapter on Example Charts illustrating how to apply Jyotish to real horoscopes.    Although the book has been promoted as an introductory text on Jyotisha, the reader will benifit more from the book if (s)he starts with a more preliminary book on Vedic Astrology and then studies this book as an intermediate level book. The reader can directly start with this book if (s)he already has some basic knowledge of Jyotish.    One more advice to  the reader. The subject matter in this book should be digested slowly and patiently. It took me multiple reading sessions to finish a single chapter, but this really helped me fully  comprehending the subject matter.    I myself started with \\"Beneath a Vedic Sky\\" by William Levacy (See my review) and then read 'Light on Life'. Profound thanks to Hart De Fouw and Robert Svoboda for sharing their knowledge and expericence of Jyotisha through this book.
B00005JMEW|2.0|I can only guess that most of these reviews are based upon the fact that Quentin Tarantino is such a &quot;down to earth&quot; guy that some of the reviewers are hoping he offers them a part in his next film.  Tarantino is the SHOCK-JOCK of movie making; in all of Tarantino's movies, his main goal is to shock the viewer with violence...got that.  Yes, we got that.  Boy, do we have that by now.<br />Kill Bill is a music video - death dance.  111 minutes of me starting to wish one of those Samuri swords Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu were flipping around might cut the tape to this dreadful VHS tape I actually rented today.<br />This movie may have action, but it has no drawing force to pull you into what is happening.  Every fight scene last a little too long; every cut off limb spews out blood just a little too long; and I wasn't impressed with a twelve-year-old cartoon girl seducing an Asian mob-boss so she could drive a blade through his chest.<br />If you think Howard Stern is cool, you might like this movie.  If you think profanity and rampant violence make a movie great, then by all means, rush out and buy this DVD (or buy it here at Amazon.com).  But if you enjoy a movie with some substance and good dialogue, hold off on this one.<br />I have watched a few interviews with Tarantino, and I must say I was quite impressed with his demeanor - he seems really cool.  I'm sure this review will be disliked by his fans, but I think he could have made a better film than what I just watched.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I purchased this set having never seen the series or, really, any ads for the series.  I figured that anything Joss Whedon does has to be at least as good as Buffy or Angel, and therefore was worth my money.  I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />I have to admit that I thought the premise was a little hokey - cowboys in space?  Come on!  There are parts with twinges of hokiness (mainly surrounding the language and some of the cheesy expressions that seem to be overused), but they don't matter.  This show is one of the best I've seen!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|A written description of Gilmore Girls can do the series no justice. The rapid-fire writing is some of the sharpest on television, the plots are rarely, if never, cliche and the large stable of characters never fails to make you laugh. It's rare for a show to strike a perfect balance between comedy and drama with no sappiness attached, but Gilmore Girls succeeds and truly breaks new ground. It's about time this series made it to DVD; it's hard to find better programming on any network.
B00006879E|5.0|This album is fabulous!!  No one I know can identify the genre it belongs in because it's rock, funk, pop all mixed together.  Be sure to check out tracks 4 (she will be loved), 10 (through with you), and 11 (not coming home). They're all great but those are the stand outs!
0553106635|3.0|First off, I must admit: I adore reading the Song of Ice and Fire series, I've read it more than once, and I believe it's very well-written. The political intrigue is brilliantly conceived, and the world it's set in has been developed to the exceeding detail that's a characteristic of many great fantasy novels, like Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time (and of course Tolkien's Lord of the Rings). And SoIaF is better at keeping the reader's interest in some ways than WoT, refraining from going into immense detailed paragraphs about things irrelevant to the plot. <br />However, Song of Ice and Fire's intensifying sources of woe(horrendous rape, torture, execution, etc.), growing particularly apparent in Storm of Swords, are getting slightly tiring. The fact is, even though you come to sympathize with many of Martin's great, well-developed characters, you start to become sick of everyone becoming subject to every awful occurence that one could possibly conceive of in a fantasy setting...multiple times. Inner conflict starts blurring together, and I cringe every time I come upon yet another character about to declare: &quot;ANGST! Angst, angst angst and more angst! Oh my angsty angsty angst!&quot; etc. etc. Little that is new and different from what's previously happened in A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings shows up, also. The novelties that seemed so interesting and wonderful in the beginning start getting old--&quot;Oh, no, not more obsessing over the Iron Throne. Aaah.&quot;
B00000294R|5.0|Unquestionably one of the top five mid-90s NY thug-rap albums. A plethora of slick rhymes painting the stick-up-in-the-park kind of pre-P-diddy era. Plus two pre-fame guest spots from a young Pre-in the Hamptons Jay-Z and L's fellow Harlemite &quot;Murder&quot; Mace-pre-Christian.
0385474547|5.0|Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe was a wonderfully as well as enlightening novel.  It was well composed and deeply compelling.  The story of the Igbo Village and the main character Okonkow and his family presents a sweet yet chilling interpretation of the European Colonization of Africa. The in depth details within the novel of the Igbo beliefs and rituals draws the reader into a world that he or she has never experienced.  The story of the life of this particular ethnic group is presented in the context of the idea of things falling apart.  The title is an omen within the story the keeps the reader reading and helps create a deep sense of loss at the end of the story.  This is a marvelously written novel that evokes joy, tears, and deep contemplation on the apart of the reader.  It may just be the best book I have ever read and I would venture to call myself well-read.
0060987464|5.0|You wouldn't think a middle aged Southern conservative housewife like me would be caught dead reading something like this.  The cover alone should scare me away.  And the first word of the first chapter is one I wasn't allowed to say as a child.  But with that first word Manson reveals immediately what his entire book portrays - Hell.  The story mates his life with Dante's Inferno; even the chapters are structured as the divisions and circles of Dante's hell.  This was a stroke of genius and makes for a fascinating read.  Manson's life parallels Dante's journey through hell, and, like in the Inferno, it begins with pain and steadily becomes much worse.  In the Inferno however, the protagonist with whom we identify is Dante, who is not one of the punished.  We must guess at the psychic torment of the damned through Dante's conversations with them.  Manson takes us on the same journey but as one of the condemned.  He takes us inside his head to see firsthand the progressive blackening and relentless decay of his soul.<br />But that is only one of the many levels on which this book operates.  It is also the story of a man's struggle to come to terms with his own nature when that nature is something the world perceives as evil and he suspects they may be right.  He has amazing self awareness, and the rare ability to articulate his inner battles in powerful, captivating ways.  The book is riveting, for he is laying bare his soul for all to see, and he knows it is ugly.<br />But by the end of the book, after he has sunk to the dark bottom of the pit, there is a glimmer of hope.  He gains the sense that there may be some beauty hidden under all the self-loathing and screw ups that are his existence.  Like Dante, Manson finally confronts Satan himself, and discovers the exit from hell.<br />But if you are not up to all this psychological and metaphysical stuff, you can just enjoy the book on its surface.  Wicked, outrageous, and at times hilarious, it is fast paced and fullof action, but not for the prudish or squeamish.  Be prepared for something that is probably worse than triple X and is quite disturbing.  I have never heard Marilyn Manson's music and I'm not real sure I want to, as &quot;heavy metal&quot; just isn't my thing, but I stumbled upon this book quite by accident and must say it is one of the most entertaining reads I've ever had.  I highly recommend it for anyone who has an interest in infernal literature, typically written by the righteous, as this is an equally compelling point of view from the debased sinner.  The violence and shock rivals John Bunyan, but from the opposite side!
B00009V7RF|5.0|Ok, I admit it.  I bought Elephunk because of Where is the Love, that catchy, socially-concious song that I couldn't get out of my head.  I had never bought a hip hop CD before, and wouldn't have, if the price was any higher.  But believe me, if there's any CD you should buy right now, THIS IS IT!!  I love every song on this CD, and you will too.  Definitely worth every penny!
0553582445|5.0|This is a clean break from the other farseer books, A gripping novel which promises a VERY late night reading period.  Not great for people still at school!  THe magic of this book does not solely like within its wonderful characters, and masterful plots, but its ability to make you cry, laugh, scream with anger and frustration within the fist chapter. DO your self a favour, cut back on the coffee and save the money for this book!  Cause you sure don't need it readin this novel!.
B000056PWV|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock movies, but I have to say that Rear Window is one of my all time favorites.  It has all the elements of a great picture; A star studded cast with Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, and Raymond Burr, suspense and intrigue, and even thought provoking dialog.<br />Jimmy Stewart is a photographer that has been laid up with a broken leg.  Unable to leave his apartment, he becomes board and has found that his only entertainment comes from watching his neighbors across the courtyard.  He becomes obsessive about a particular neighbor played by Raymond Burr whom he believes has committed murder.<br />With the help of his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly, they set out to find the evidence they need to prove that the crime has actually been committed. Acting as his legs, Grace Kelly finds herself in some very dangerous situations, and all Jimmy Stewart can do is watch from his rear window.
B0000931QR|5.0|This album is one of the best I've heard. Because the songs are very good, and I'm not saying that because of this review. I have never been a fan of LODVG until recently when I heard one of the songs on the radio so you can say it was an impact on pop latin music. So there you have it even if your not a fan you should listen to it anyways
0767903862|5.0|This is the 1st Bill Bryson book I've read, and already I love the guy!!! Easy read, VERY informative, and funny!

B00004RFFS|3.0|Anne Rice's dark and maudlin tales are among my favorite in the vampire genre.  However, I never bought Tom Cruise as Lestat.  I am sure he tried very hard, but he never convinced me.  I was sorry that Anne Rice recanted her initial vehement objection to his playing the role.  Brad Pitt and Antonio Banderas, on the other hand, were excellently cast.  I read that Anne Rice patterned Lestat after a young Rutger Hauer. It's a pity he was too old to play the part in this movie, as he would have been brilliant in it.
B00005JMSE|4.0|I went into this movie with low expectations - comic book adaptation, CGI heavy, number one at the box office, bad reviews on Amazon... In fact I only went into this movie because Dogville was sold out...  However, my cynicism melted away after about five minutes, and before I knew what was happening I was really enjoying myself!<br />The plot really isn't much more than what you see in the trailer, but the way it was carried out was refreshing and enthralling and fun.  HBoy is a very (post?)modern superhero - grumpy like Shrek, resents his gifts, fears nothing and full of wisecracks.  Oh he also loves kittens and \\"Baby Ruth\\" chocolate bars.  The supporting characters are a little less developed, but still interesting, if somewhat more formulaic. Normally I loathe CGI, but here it was very well used, remaining believable without ever being overpowering.  The \\"Labyrinth\\"-esque set at the end is particularly good. For me the main costume problem was Hellboy's makeup, which never really looked anything more than molded plastic.<br />My main complaint with this movie would be that it moves too quickly.  The premise is set up in the teaser, jump to the present day, introduce the characters, then BOOM - first and (pretty much) final assignment.  Even the ending was a tad rushed in my opinion where (POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD...) Hellboy throws the grenades into the beast (if you didn't see that one coming then there's no hope for you...).  The grenades are popping all the way down his gullet, leading to an anticlimactic explosion.  What I would've expected would be some grenade swallowing, then a brief pause where it looks like it hasn't worked and THEN beast fondue, but that's a minor point...<br />An example of the post-modern humor in the movie (aside from all the HBoy comics lying around) is the shout-out to the original Matrix movie.  HBoy is fighting a beastie in the subway when a telephone starts ringing. They both freeze momentarily, Hboy moves as if to pick up the phone and then rips the kiosk up and smacks the beastie on the head. Classic.<br />This is the best PG13 movie I've seen in a loooong while, and I think it really does have something for everyone. It really does move fast enough that you don't have time to dwell on the  huge gaps in the plot... (Why is Selma Blair's character straight out of X2? Why bother resurrecting Rasputin? Why would Nazis particularly want to destroy the world? Why would Hellboy not rebel against his father? Why is the moon a portal to another dimension where big foff beasties live? How does Rasputin appear everywhere? Why hadn't he killed the professor before? What's up with the key thing in faceless guy's chest? How can Hellboy bring ancient russian corpses back from the dead but not awaken his own father to ask if they're being lured into a plot? Why storm the bad guys place with 3 soldiers?  How does the fishy guy get away from 3 beasties in the subway and live? Why do the beasties need to lay eggs to breed if rasputin makes two of 'em for every one that dies?  Why does HBoy get knocked out by Selma's fire when he's immune to heat?) Anyway, I could go on (and I fear I have...), but HBoy's a lot better than you think it will be, so give it a go and let yourself be entertained for a while!nd then rips the kiosk up and smacks the beastie on the head.

B000000I0H|4.0|When this album came out, it was a double LP.  It probably should have been condensed into one album.  This release has some of the best sections of Oldfield music in existence, mostly contained in Parts 1 and 3.  Many other parts of the album are, however, very repetitive and grate.  The Song of Hiawatha poem in part 2 is quite nice but, once again, goes on too long.  This CD is certainly worth picking up, if nothing else for the first and third parts.  Even these are repetitive in places, however.  This is nothing like the tightly constructed Platinum that followed it.
B00005JM02|4.0|I believe she enjoyed Nemo very much, as she watched the whole 100+ minutes of it WITHOUT going to the bathroom !!! Doubtless I had to explain some points to her (why Nemo's mother is missing etc) but she was able to follow the story most the time. The silliness of Dory was lost on her, but then she may be a bit too young to understand fully the memory lost / forgetfulness of adults.<br />She wasn't scared of the shark nor of the whale. The pictures were very clear (and seemed real to her), we could even see the fish scales.<br />Other than that, all in all, the story has a happy ending (of course :-), and if she could give points, I think she'll give this 5 stars. I gave this 4 stars, and recommend this for kids of all ages.
B00008RH1H|5.0|Akira Kurosawa's Throne Of Blood may very well be his best, ranking up there with Seven Samurai, Ran, Yojimbo, Rashomon, and The Hidden Fortess.<BR>      A telling of Macbeth the film takes place in the time of the samurai. Tashiro Mifune plays Washizu a worrior who betrays his master and friend on his climb to the ultimite of power. <BR>     After encountering a witch in the woods who tells Washizu that he will take the place of his master Washizu, with the not so suddle proding of his wicked wife, dose everything in his power to gain, the lose control, of everything.<BR>     Kurosawa had done Shakespear before, quite possably the best telling of King Lear was Ran, but this time he strips everything down to the bear bone and unlike some films from Japan, the acting, manic and frantic, seeems only to enhance the film. Mifune is fantastic as Washizu, the ill fated worrior.<BR>     The movie grabs you right from the beggining and never lets go. It's a very violent film for it's time but if you ever want to see a master at his craft look no further than Akira Kurosawa'a Throne Of Blood.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|You wouldn't think a movie that is flamboyant and over the top like Moulin Rouge would work. Nothing looks like it makes sense but it all falls together to make a very special movie.<br />Christian(McGreggor) is a poor writer. He knows almost nothing of love, but is determined to write about it. He teams up with some of his neighbors who want to produce a play. They need a screenwriter so they get Christian to do it. They want to have there play seen at the Moulin Rouge. The local theater and whorehouse. It's there that Christian meets Satine.(Kidman) He quickly falls in love with the beautiful courtesan who feels the same way for him. She agrees reluctantly to star in there play. They need money for there play though. They get a local Duke(Roxburg) to give them money to make the play. He in return wants the full service and love of Satine. Christan and Satine now must hide there love before they are caught as they try to make this play about there love work.<br />Nicole Kidman is awesome in this film. She plays Satine like nobody else could of. She finished filming this movie and spent time promoting it during her high profile divorce from Tom Cruise. She was very stressed and you can really tell towards the end of the movie. Her character in the movie is very stressed because she had TB and shes in a love triangle that could end her life. Kidman releases some of her real life stress on the screen and thats why this is such a special performance. She deserved the Oscar nomination she got for this role and really she should have won.<br />Ewan McGreggor is fantastic in the movie. This guy really is an underrated actor. He continually gets small movies like this and puts out unforgetable performances. He's finally coming to his own as one of the hottest rising actors in Hollywood. He should have gotten as Oscar nomination for this role and in most years would have gotten it.<br />The music is really great in Moulin Rogue. Kidman and McGreggor both display there greatvocals. I love it when Ewan sings &quot;Your Song.&quot; He really does have a good voice and I thought the producers should have promoted him singing the song more. They really could have attracted more people to the movie. None of the songs are original and it's humorous to see songs like &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; sung in the late 1890's. It doesn't make sense but it works. My favortie song from the movie is the love medley from the Elephant Room.<br />The movie looks fantastic on screen. The movie won Oscars for best sets and best costumes. It's really easy to see why the movie won them. Everything looks fantastic and you really do feel like you are in 19 century France.<br />This is a fantastic musical. It really has jump started the musical genre and movies like Chicago wouldn't have been as successful without this picture. It's a fun movie that would be enjoyed by almost everybody. If you want to see an enchanting musical and romantic movie than go get this now.
0783241569|2.0|A by-the-numbers romantic comedy, &quot;Notting Hill&quot; is however one of the most overrated movies of its genre. Sure, the lead stars (Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts) have some charisma, Roger Michell`s directing is smooth and subtle, the story has a couple of funny scenes and most of the (very british) cast delivers highly convincing performances. Still, this modern fairy tale about a love relationship between a movie star and an ordinary, middle class guy is not only unrealistic but also almost 100% predictable and unsurprising. The plot shows little original ideas, offering a set of cliches and &quot;been there, done that&quot; situations. &quot;Notting Hill&quot; is definitely a well made, professional product nonetheless, yet the overall result doesn`t rise above average and uninspired material, a rehash of old ideas and concepts. It`s an alright saturday-afternoon innofensive flick, providing a mildly entertaining cinematic experience that helps to pass the time. A competent Hollywood piece of fluff, but very far from a classic achievement.<br />An ordinary feel-good movie.
B000002UR7|4.0|I'm probably one of the most unorthodox Radiohead fans.  Instead of starting with &quot;OK Computer&quot; as my first Radiohead album, I started with &quot;Kid A&quot;.  At first I didn't like it too much, but after listening to it over and over, it began to grow on me and I eventually loved Radiohead.  So I proceeded to buy OKC and &quot;The Bends&quot;, which I really enjoyed.  Then &quot;Amnesiac&quot; came out, so I bought that and I thought it was okay, but not up to par with &quot;Kid A&quot;.  Then, I bought the live EP, which held me over until the next album &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot;, which is also a good album (not great, though).  So that brings me to this album.  This was the last Radiohead album I bought, and I have to say, it's not that bad considering all of the bad reviews I've read of it.  So anyway...on to the album.<br />First off, you can definitely tell it was made during the late grunge era, since most of the songs are loud and self indulgent.  However, the way that Radiohead performs these songs makes them a whole lot better.  After this album and before The Bends, Radiohead was known as the Creep Band, but Creep isn't the only good song on here.  In fact, all of the songs on here are pretty darn good if you don't start into comparisons with their other albums.  My personal favorites are &quot;Stop Whispering&quot; and &quot;Thinking About You&quot; because they're the most emotional songs.  But the rest of them are also really good, especially &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot;, &quot;Vegetable&quot;, and &quot;Blow Out&quot;.  The only song I don't really like is &quot;Ripcord&quot; but it's still okay.  Also, I'm not surprised that &quot;Prove Yourself&quot; is no longer played by the band, because you can imagine how many teens would be singing the lines &quot;I'm better off dead&quot; at their concerts, turning it into a cheesy suicide song when it's a serious song.<br />Overall, if you're a new Radiohead fan, you should probably start here, or with The Bends, or with OK Computer, in order to be introduced to their style.  Then, you should purchase &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, and &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot;, since they're much less guitar driven and more experimental and progressive.
1592400876|1.0|Yes, I know this is not a \\"grammar\\" book, but at least the chapters or paragraphs should have logical flow.  Instead, not only were the sections set in a non-linear way (the line of thoughts were jumping around), moreover, I found the book to be colloquial and pedantic.<br /><br />To me, it's supposed to talk about punctuation, hence the chapters should have clearer headings as such.  Within a chapter, the author would suddenly jump off at a tangent to discuss about spellings.  And sometimes, the tone would lapse into a chit-chat manner.<br /><br />If this was supposed to \\"help\\" people improve their punctuation, spelling, grammar, whatever (sic), then I believe the style of the whole book should be consistent.  I would give this 2.5 stars, but since there are no half-star in Amazon ratings, I gave it ***.
B00006690G|4.0|This cat has singles that can be considered some of the greatest songs in hip hop history.  The guy is breaking new ground with his lyrics and subject matter.  That is what an M.C. is supposed to do.  Like Tupac, Mele Melle, N.W.A., Wu-Tang and Public Enemy before him.  He has at least 5 songs that can be considered classics.  How many other M.C.'s can say that.  If he was black everyone would be calling him the greatest of all time.  Wait until he matures, the bar is gonna be set so high a Plane could fly into it.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Never before have I heard such a pure voice, who doesn't just sing the words, but truly FEELS the lyrics. You can hear it when Josh sings. A must have for every music fan, but NOT for opera or clasical music purists.
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis had a lot to live up to with this album. Their first album is considered by many to be the greatest debut album of all-time. That meant the pressure was on with (What's The Story)Morning Glory? and the guys stepped up. They stepped up and made one of the best albums of all-time.<br />The songs on this album are awesome. All are penned by Noel Gallagher. This is one of those albums where you will listen to every song on the album. All pretty good, but there are some gems on this album.<br />&quot;Wonderwall&quot; is the song that everybody knows from Morning Glory. It's the biggest Oasis single to date. It's easy to see why. The guitars are very catchy. The lyrics are fantastic as Noel sings about his relationship with his former girlfriend Meg Matthews. Everybody can relate to the song in some way or another.<br />&quot;Don't Look Back in Anger&quot; is my favorite track off the album. The song is about looking forward and not dwelling on what could have been or what should have been done. The chorus is simply fantastic. The song is very catchy. This song is always relevant and really is a song everybody should here. Noel displays his vocal talents on this track as well.<br />&quot;Cast No Shadow is another special song from the album. Everybody has things they wish they could say, but can't find the right words to say. This song is all about that. It's better when the song is sung by Noel, but Liam sings it on the album.<br />&quot;Some Might Say&quot; is another special song from this album. It was a number one hit in the U.K. It's considered by many to be the best Oasis song. The song really does ask a lot of great philosophical questions. The song has a great chorus and is really catchy.<br />&quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; was another big hit for the guys. The song is the most phsycodelic Oasis song you will ever hear. Once again it's a song that a lot of people can relate to. It's a very pretty song that has some great lyrics in it. It's one of the bestsongs that Noel has penned to date.<br />This is a spectacular album. All the songs that I didn't talk about are good songs. The only song I dislike off this album are the instrumental tracks. I don't know what the guys were thinking when they put them on there. This really is a special album though. Everybody can relate to it in one way or another. Noel writes about human emotions like few other people can. Everybody should own this album. Go buy it now. It's very easy to find cheap. You won't regret buying this one.
6304578458|2.0|Combining elements of thriller, romantic/black comedy, con movies and some Tarantino references, &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; is a decent offbeat flick that manages to entertain but doesn`t make much of an impression. John Cusack plays a hitman who goes to a highschool reunion in his hometown. He meets his ex-girlfriend (played by Minnie Driver) whom he left ten years ago, and some contrived situations unfold in the process. His job causes a couple of problems, so he figures out that it`s better to choose another kind of life. Although this movie is witty at parts, it doesn`t work very well as a whole and seems too disjointed to convince. The acting is ok, the directing isn`t bad and the soundtrack is good enough (Violent Femmes, The Cure, The Clash, Eels,...), yet the plot and pacing are just too flawed and uneven. This kind of stuff has been done before (and better) in movies like &quot;True Love&quot;, so &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; ends up being a mildly interesting but ultimately disposable effort.<br />As watchable as it is forgettable.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|Wonderfull soundtrack! But I can`t find one song, which is singed at the end of film. It is after &quot;Salerosa&quot; and before &quot;Meiko&quot;. Can anybody help me saying the title and singer (woman)<BR>thanks a lot<BR>Konrad
B0000640VO|5.0|Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and starring Audrey Tatou in the title role, \\"Amelie\\" is set in the Montmartre area of Paris. The film focuses on Amelie, the only child of Raphael and Amandine Poulain. Her father is a neurotic ex-army doctor while her mother was a teacher with all the warmth of an iceberg. Withheld from school as a child, due to her father's mistaken belief that she had a heart defect, Amelie was educated at home - initially by her mother. Amandine died when Amelie was young, however, when she broke the fall of a suicidal Canadian jumping from the tower of Notre Dame Cathedral. Her lack of contact with other children meant her only friend was a goldfish called Blubber and led to the development of quite an active imagination. <br />Even as an adult, Amelie amuses herself with silly questions without ever really becoming close to anyone. She regularly visits her father, Raphael - he would dearly love to travel, but is too afraid to take the first step. She works as a waitress in a café called Les Deux Moulins, a real café in Montmartre. Among her colleagues are Gina, who seems to be the closest thing to a friend Amelie has and Georgette, who runs the tabac. Georgette is quite possibly the definitive hypochondriac. One of the café's regulars is a man called Joseph - a former lover of Gina, he is an incredibly jealous and possessive character who constantly spies on her.<br />As the film progresses, she becomes friendly with an elderly neighbour. Commonly known as the Glass Man, his real name is Raymond Dufayel. He never leaves his apartment, and has an obsession of his own : Renoir's \\"Luncheon of the Boating Party\\". Dufayel has painted one of his own every year for the last twenty years, but he just can't get it right. One of the film's most likeable characters is Lucien, who works at the greengrocers and takes art lessons with Dufayel. Amelie, who is very fond of Lucien, doesn't really care for his boss - the obnoxious and abusive Monsieur Collignon. <br />Amelie's life starts to change when she finds a small box of keepsakes hidden in the wall of her bathroom - toy cars and bikes, pictures of football players and such like. Based on the box's contents, she believes that the box was hidden there in the 50s by a young boy, and decides to reunite the box with its owner. Looking for information about who lived in her apartment at that time, she starts with Madeleine Wells. An emotional wreck, her husband ran off with his secretary to South America, and was killed in a car accident there. Nico Quincampoix, however, provides the biggest reason for change. Another loner, like Amelie, he collects photos left lying around the photo booths of the city's metro and train stations. For some reason, he keeps these in a photo album - which is found by Amelie after he drops it in the street. However, she finds she has fallen for him - but like her father, she seems afraid to take the first step. <br />This is easily one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen. Set in one of the world's most beautiful cities and featuring a collection of quirky and / or likeable characters, it's a film I just can't find fault with. It's filmed in French and subtitled, which might put some people off - for me, however, the subtitles actually seem to add to the film's enjoyment.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Stephen Spielberg would have done better with a willingness to make a longer movie out of A.I. Artificial Intelligence.  There was so much more that could have been done with this fine idea for a film.  This is somewhat out of the normal genre for a Spielberg film, being the byproduct of a Stanley Kubrick idea.  Unfortunately, Mr. Kubrick passed away before much collaboration between him and Mr. Spielberg could take place.<BR>Haley Joel Osment is, in keeping with his abilities, wonderfully convincing in this role.  His acting is so innocent and pure that it is difficult to believe that the boy in the movie and the boy that is playing him are really separate.  The supporting work performed by Jude Law is outstanding and provides a much needed comic aspect to the film.  Most of the other supporting acting is forgettable, with small parts being assigned to relative unknowns.<BR>Special effects and set design is engaging.  Makeup and costume is believable.  The soundtrack is superb, as John Williams lends his considerable talent to this film.  Cinematography and directoral styling is clean, typical of a Spielberg product.  The one area of needed improvement would be in film flow.  There are a number of scenes that could use more material, more dialogue.  It feels as though there was too much film that got left on the editing booth floor.<BR>In the end, this &quot;Pinocchio&quot; story is entertaining and evokes emotion in many of the most jaded viewers.  Recommended for fans of fairy tale stories.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Julia was fine in Notting Hill and Sleeping with the Enemy, but hard to take seriously in this role where she is supposedly ventage outrage at girdles. As an audience, are we supposed to believe outrage at traditional female icons from this actress who has certainly embraced a goddess image for herself?  Not to say that she should eschew it, since it has served her well.  But to play a role where she is supposedly outraged at feminine stereotypes makes her laughable.  <br />You get the sense, here in and in Erin B., that she wants her cake and to eat it too, to have the goddess image and still have roles of substance.  To use her movie roles to &quot;instruct&quot; -- as she puts it in one of the DVD extras. But please, who is she kidding?  Her real life &quot;role&quot; is no less a fantasy than the &quot;freedom girdles&quot; of the 50s, and very little less repressive in its perfection as an icon for women today than the icons she is rebelling against in the movie.  Are we supposed to overlook the irony of a present day icon venting outrage at the iconography of the 50s?  How valid a statement is that? Is she that blind, or does she take her female audience to be blind and dumb not to expect us to see the hypocrisy here?<br />Though Julia could better have been replaced with a more believable actress, (and the other teachers or adult women were largely cardboard stereotypes) the girls, I thought were wonderful.  Dunst was a good foil, but I thought all the girls were excellent. They come of age pretty much on their own, were surprisingly fresh and novel, considering the rest of the cookie cutter ensemble. I can't see that the art teacher has all that much influence, but that's as it should be.  The girls are what this movie is or should be about. <br />In general a movie worth seeing for the portrait of the times, and the wonderful supporting cast in the girls, even if Julia herself is ridiculous in the central role.
B0000A1RJI|3.0|the music is good, no doubt.<BR>however, there are couple of tracks that end at the beginning of the next one.<BR>now that may make sense in a movie, however on a CD it doesn't.<BR>i import my CD into AAC in iTunes, and i sometimes don't listen to my music &quot;in order&quot;.<BR>that means, sometimes i'd hear a misterous sound in the beginning of a song, which is actually the end of the song before.<BR>it could've been easily cut and arranged neatly, and it's kinda annoying if you ask me.
0767805712|5.0|Just rented this movie last night for the first time and I must say that I am truly impressed. A bit slow moving, but makes up for it in smarts, music and acting. This is Jude Laws first major role as the cripple and you can tell right away why he has become such a great actor. This movie and &quot;Training Day&quot; are probably the only two films I can stand Ethan Hawke in and thats a good thing. Uma Thurman is pretty good and beautiful as the love interest (see the &quot;Kill Bill&quot; Volumes for true Uma!). Ethan was a retard for cheating on her in real life! If you want a great science fiction film with events that could actually happen one day, look no further than Gattaca.
B0000WN0VY|5.0|I first heard of Damien Rice when he made his television debut on David Letterman. I was instantly blown away. When I listened to &quot;O&quot; my awe of this artist increased exponentially. Damien Rice is easily the best thing to come out of Ireland since U2. The CD tells a story and in keeps you enthralled from the opening lines of soft and sincere &quot;Delicate&quot; to the angry and scornful &quot;I Remember&quot; operatic climax of &quot;Eskimo&quot; (the greatest song to be written about writer's block I think). Although he has been called demanding for only agreeing to do a certain number of appearances a week (Damien: &quot;I'm not promoting my album; I'm protecting it.&quot;) he is destined to be one of the greatest artists of our time.
B00008PC2O|5.0|The Terminator series is one of the greatest movie series of this day. With the Ausome Special Effects (except for the first one, lol) These movies are science fiction at its highest level. However the T2 with the Metal Case is a bad but unless u plan on not using the metal case. You will find once you open ur DVD and slide it out of the metal case it will ruin the plastic case on the inside. You will notice the damage after a few times of watching. I Was just warning u.
B00003CXTG|4.0|It's good . I like it so several times have seen it at home.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I love this CD! I definately recommend you go get this! I mean, this great, and you will not regret buying this cd unless you're just a hater!! And if you don't think this album is sick as hell, then you didn't really listen to this debut! Go check out my March 15, 2004 review to see the details on this cd! I put hard work into that review!! AND DAMN THAT \\"ALL FALLS DOWN\\" SONG IS HOT AS HELL BECAUSE IT'S #1 ON 106 & PARK!! BY THE WAY, THAT \\"NEVER LET ME DOWN\\" SONG ON THERE IS RECCOMENDED TO BE LISTENED TO!! I EVEN DID A POLL ON THIS KANYE WEST CD ON AIM 2 WEEKS AGO, AND THE MOST VOTED SONG ON THERE FROM THE COLLEGE DROPOUT: ALL FALLS DOWN!!!<br />GODDAMN!
1892005034|5.0|While I agree with another reviewer who questioned the rather stilted examples in the book, I believe that the premises on which this book is based are absolutely sound - that all humans want to be understood and acknowledged.<br />I've worked myself, and coached adult students to work through some of the example scenarios. They prompted lively debate, critical thinking and crucial self-reflection about our own styles of communicating with ourselves and others. <br />We realized that we often put judgement into our language when we think we are simply describing beahaviour. We were struck by the realization that our English language often adds to the confusion when we make statements like: &quot;I feel that this is unfair&quot;. Rosenberg spends a whole chapter on us being able to actually express feelings, rather than opinions and thoughts, as the above quote exemplifies.<br />He helped me realize that I rarely sort out for myself what personal need I have of another, and I was struck by the simplicity and power of being sure that I am able to identify what request I have of the other person that will address my need. Since I am practicing these skills with my teenager - you KNOW that they are truly being put to the test!<br />This is a book that is much better shared with at least one other person so that you can share the examples and share the hard work of changing unconscious communication patterns. If you breeze through this book as an interesting read, you won't get much out of it. If you treat it as a workbook, with gems of wisdom that need to be assessed, and practiced and made your own - then this is a treasure, and one you'll return to again and again.
B0001611DI|4.0|I had just finished watching the movie in my bedroom, since my kids were around the house.  Too young to view the movie.  Anyway, my wife mocked in asking &quot;How was your cheesy movie?&quot;  You know, I couldn't really argue with her about some of the things in the movie that gave it it's &quot;Cheesiness&quot;.  And for the record, let me say I &quot;HATE&quot; that term &quot;Cheesy&quot;.  What the heck is &quot;Cheesy&quot; mean anyway?  With that said let me list the things that really give this film a bad rap:<br />1) Costume design - Zombies were just so, stupid looking with gray paint, which, looked like it came off rather easy.  Also, some of them looked too neatly dressed, shirt all tucked in, some of the shirts didn't look ripped, shirts buttoned, well groomed.  I mean, come on now.  Some of the zombies did look pretty good alone, for example, bald zombie, top of head cut off by helicopter zombie, eating a leg zombie, and of course, the Roger zombie!!!<br />2) Music.  Dated, '70s music.  Some of the music took away from the intensity of the movie.  The &quot;Military&quot; music was so, funny.  Well, the movie was made in the '70s, so what are you going to do.  But, I've read many reviews how much they liked the music by the &quot;Goblins&quot;.  Which, by the way I've never heard of them.  Enough said.<br />3) Inconsistencies of the zombies.  Example, I thought they couldn't open doors and climb, yet they climbed up to the roof and opened some of the doors.  What's that all about.<br />Now on to the cool things about this movie:<br />1) Great story.<br />2) Acting was very good for a '70s horror movie.<br />3) Some of the effects and the way they were done.<br />It's hard to sell this movie to people because some people would look at it and say, &quot;What's scary about it&quot;.  I admit, it took a lot for me to watch this movie let alone buy it, only because so many reviewers said how much they couldn't sleep, or it scared the heck out of them, or it was the best horror movie ever made.  When I saw it, I was like, &quot;Okay, so, why was it such an impact?&quot;.<br />I gave the movie 4 stars.  Because 1) I love zombie movies and this one is a very good one.  2) Acting and story was good for a 70's movie.  3) There just aren't that many good &quot;Zombie&quot; movies like this one.  Maybe things'll change.as the best horror movie ever made.  When I saw it, I was like, &quot;Okay, so, why was it such an impact?&quot;.<br />I gave the movie 4 stars.

B00008UZPD|1.0|This movie was highly recommended.  I regret wasting the time watching it.  I hoped, vainly, that it would get better but it did not.  Matix made you think about our world and our reality.  This movie did none of those things.  <br />I read a lot of SF and this script is so poorly done that I was getting madder and madder at the stupid dialog and character &quot;motivations&quot;.  I offered to lend the DVD to friends but they would not take it.  <br />If you want a well crafted movie rent or buy Donnie Darko.
0226443221|5.0|Not all that far away from the glitter and pizazz of the Miracle Mile is the hidden Chicago, where seedy SROs warehouse forgotten senior citizens, and the much-publicized heat wave exposed the horrible conditions that these members of our &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; endure. Our public health care system is a rip-off that we pay more for and get less from than any other industrialized nation in the world. We should ask not only if Chicago learned its lesson from the heat wave, but if we as a nation have learned ours. We can do better than this. geocities.com/singlepayerweb
B00005ATQD|5.0|Kubrick was a mastermind, and \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" has to be one of the most misunderstood movies ever.  Without understanding the symbolism used throughout the movie, you cannot truly understand the meaning or conclusion at all.  The cinematography used to display fidelity vs. infidelity was nothing short of genius.   If you did not like this movie, you need to watch it again with an intellectually open mind.  Ask yourself one question, is there a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow?

B00003CXCT|1.0|First off, I'd like to begin by saying that I will definitely be buying this DVD set.  I love Star Wars more than life itself (well some parts at least).  <br />However, I would like to say that I, like many, don't care for the Special Edition release.  I saw these movies when I was a kid back in the 80's and was hooked since.  I know that someone reiterated what Lucas was saying about being an 'unfinished' work of art.  But for almost everyone, the original version is the finished product.  It is what everyone grew up watching and what established his fan base.<br />I don't despise Lucas for making the Special Editions, in fact if I was in his position I might do the same if I felt the need for it.  But if your 'finished' work does not come out until 20 years after the original, then you will already have a great deal of people who only know 1 version.<br />If Lucas only sees 1 version now, the new version, then thats fine.  But why punish the people who grew up watching the original, the people who created the fan base which allowed Lucas to even make this Special Edition, by not including the Original which stood for 20 years.<br />If the special edition came out only a few years after the original then I would agree in having only the 1 version, but were talking 20 years here.  I want to watch the film that I grew up on.<br />As I said, I love Star Wars and already have this pre ordered.  I just wanted to throw in my 2cents.
B000002U9W|2.0|I've been a Pink Floyd fan for many years - and for a while I was pretty much a fanatic.  But there is one album I was never able to get into.  And believe me I tried.  I wanted to like it -I played it many times, hoping it would somehow click, but it just didn't.<br />Yes - it is an important album in the history of Pink Floyd.  Without Atom Heart Mother, there would probably be no Dark Side of the Moon.  It kindof marks the signpost where the early Floyd turned into the fully realized Floyd.  If you need to complete your Pink Floyd collection, by all means, get it.<br />However, if you are new to Pink Floyd, or looking to expand beyond Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall, don't look here.  You will be disappointed.<br />With that said, it does have one of my all-time favorite album covers (for whatever that's worth).
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Beware the reviewer who doesn't automatically and without question give any and all Beatle albums, and songs, 5 stars.  The result will be the responses recently posted, and continual reminders of how the british biased &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; poll ranks all Beatle albums in the top 10.  What a defense...  All of these reviews seem to lack an actual review of the music, however. <br />As for an actual review of Beatles 1, the track listing reflects the band's path; very strong songs on the first half when Lennon and McCartney collaborated (I Feel Fine, Ticket to Ride, &amp; Paperback Writer), and weaker songs on the second half (The Ballad of John &amp; Yoko - who cares.) 3-stars, because I actually listened to the CD.
1592400876|5.0|I was absolutely prepared to hate this book-even some editors can't stand grammar and punctuation pedants. But Lynne Truss quickly won me over with her charming blend of passion, humor and trivia. (Did you know the first Russian Revolution was sparked by printers angry over punctuation?) Everyone can learn from Truss's clear and common-sense explanation of punctuation marks and their usage, and her occasional lapses into wild-eyed orthodoxy are quickly forgiven. Only one major cavil: Truss seems to think the New Yorker is a model for American punctuation and usage. That's like using &quot;Brideshead Revisted&quot; as a primer on modern British life! It also seems strange that the publishers, in taking our American dollars, couldn't make the minor modifications necessary to conform to U.S. punctuation standards. But this is a very entertaining and informative book nonetheless, highly recommended to any reader.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|Here's the classic example of a band that had one excellent album, but when their megalomaniacal self-absorbed leader Axl Rose's ego got out of control, their music went downhill as a result.  Guns N' Roses came out of the gates strong with Appetite For Destruction, a straight forward blast of anthemic hard rock that was the perfect antidote for anyone that couldn't tolerate the state of rock music in 1987.  <br />They followed it up with GN'R Lies which brought together a few live songs with new semi-acoustic material including the awkward, cloying &quot;Patience&quot; as well as &quot;Used To Love Her&quot; and &quot;One In A Million&quot;, featuring lyrics that were written in a blatant attempt to create controversy.  <br />After that came Use Your Illusion I &amp; II, two albums which are the epitome of bloated excess. UYI I &amp; II consisted of rockers that would have been B-sides had they been recorded during the sessions for AFD, and overwrought ballads like &quot;November Rain&quot; and &quot;Don't Cry&quot; which are so over the top and grandiose that even bands like Rush and Yes look modest in comparison.  There were a few solid songs, sure, but even if they pared it down to one album and put all the good songs on there, it would still be a disappointment compared to AFD.  Let's not forget the unnecessary album The Spaghetti Incident?, which featured covers of songs that were way too true to the original arrangement - GN'R failed to put their stamp on those songs and make any of them their own.<br />In summary: If Appetite For Destruction was the sound of a band that was hungry and driven to succeed at any cost (but on their own terms), the later albums are the sound of dinosaur rockers that have achieved worldwide fame and success, and even though their best days are far behind them, they are content to just go through the motions to make a quick buck.  Pick up AFD if you're looking for a GN'R album - this album consists of 3 good songs and a whole lot of pointless drivel.
073930870X|5.0|I read all of the Song of Ice and Fire series before they were put into audio form and I was soooo excited to see that they were available in audio! The narrator Roy Dotrice does an astounding job, especially for such a massive work as A Song of Ice and Fire. He handles his characterizations steadily, he doesn't use ridiculous mincing voices for the female characters, and the more disgusting figures, ie Vargo Hoat, will make your skin crawl. The books are simply the best fantasy written in many many years. Incredibly rich and complicated storylines and character development. I love it that you never know who to trust. Martin will not let you get too comfortable with your favorite characters.
0783240287|4.0|I have to agree with other users in saying that Donny does portray a great Joseph.  However I've never heard a weaker performance by a narrator.  For a true treat to the ears check out the cast recording starring Michael Damian and Kelli Rabke.  Kelli puts out the best performance as the narrator in this recording that i've ever heard.  I've watched the video, listened to many of the cast recordings and seen the show live countless times and none of the performances stand out in my mind as beautifully as Rabke's and Osmand's.  What a treat it would be to see and hear the two of them together instead of the weak performance of the narrator in this video.  I have to give the video five stars for creativity though.  Recording the show as a performance to a grade school was a great way to easilly incorperate the children's chorus without them looking out of place or loosing screen time in the shadows of the stars.  <BR>Overall the video is well worth seeing especially as a precurrser to seeing the live show.
B000001IPL|4.0|This is one of the first pop-punk records I ever listened to, so it holds a special place in my heart. There's some great stuff on here that really distinguishes it from their more recent records. Songs like &quot;Genocide&quot;, &quot;Nitro (Youth Energy&quot;, and the awesome title track are straight forward popcore. I'll go out on a limb and review each song individually like this other guy did:<br />Nitro (Youth Energy) - great opening track, even though &quot;nitro&quot; is a horrible metaphor (8.0)<br />Bad Habit - I used to love this song when I was younger just because of all of the cussing in the midsection. It's a fine song, too. (7.5)<br />Gotta Get Away - This one just kinda plods along, not going anywhere. Too Nirvana-ish to be on a punk record. (4.0)<br />Genocide - a most lovely pop-core song (9.0)<br />Something to Believe - a good song, but pales in comparison to Genocide. Poor track order, anyone? (7.0)<br />Come Out and Play - a nice lil catchy pop song. Too bad they felt the need to repeat this formula over and over again. (7.5)<br />Self-Esteem - this one's catchy enough, but really slows everything down. And I can't stand the &quot;yeah&quot; chorus. (5.5)<br />It'll Be a Long Time - this song comes in and the album begins to show some life again. This is a great speedy song, and I love how it acclerates slowly in the middle. (8.0)<br />Killboy Powerhead - an upbeat song to keep the pace flowing (7.0)<br />What Happened to You? - quite a horrible little ska song. They should have just dropped this one. (2.5)<br />So Alone - good thing this song's so good. Speed! Wee! (8.0)<br />Not the One - another cool popcore song, with my some of my favorite lyrics (8.0)<br />Smash - this just tops the cake. &quot;Genocide&quot; and this alone make this album worth buying. Pop-punk at it's best (well, maybe not -best-, but Offspring's best.) (9.5)<br />So, overall... a 7.0
B000069AUI|2.0|I have to say that it's amazing what can happen if you have the right public relations people and a supportive label behind you.  This will pretty much give you the ability to conquer the world!  This definitely applies to Coldplay, a young band that has received unprecedented levels of acclaim and is so popular that they have released a live album just two albums deep into their career, but once you listen to them, you begin to wonder what the big deal is and what's so fantastic about them.<br />In essence, Coldplay have welded the mope-rock of many of their British peers with the epic-scale heartfelt passion of U2.  But unlike Bono &amp; Co., Coldplay do not seem to be evolving musically (this album is pretty much Parachutes Mach II) and they don't have much of a statement to make in their songs.  It's good to see that Chris Martin is becoming a political activist, but this does not translate to the band's music - instead, sentimental love ballads are the order of the day.  The album opens strong enough with the intense, haunting &quot;Politik&quot;, but unfortunately it's all downhill from there.<br />Coldplay's sound can best be described as Radiohead prior to OK Computer - a.k.a. the less ambitious, less daring Radiohead material.  The music is executed just fine and Martin sings with a modicum of passion, but the songs (either by themselves or as a whole) just don't make a lasting impact for some reason - it's more or less just pleasant music to listen to while sipping tea.<br />In summary: Coldplay are a good band, but have received so much critical acclaim that they've started to believe their own hype, and as such are releasing ordinary material knowing that it will be praised regardless of how much effort went into it.  Maybe the hiatus that they're on now will do them well - their tanks will be refueled and just maybe, they might be able to deliver on all that hype.
B000006TRV|5.0|Truth be told, Pink Floyd shares the pain of a child without the cliche of just words. Somehow, as we listen, there is a change in our perception of our own world as we know it. Somewhere in our subconscience we all know how it feels to really hurt. &quot;Pink&quot; Floyd is a child in an abusive household whos anguish has no words. Trauma can never be described in words alone. Verbage will never do justice to it; to know pain is to have felt it firsthand. In the title song &quot;The Wall&quot; part 2 the ending phrase being yelled &quot;If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding! How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat!?&quot; only scratches the surface of the verbal abuse he deals with. The outcry earlier in the song &quot;we don't need no education, we don't need no thought control&quot; only further describes the ultimate frustration that he deals with when he screams &quot;HEY! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!&quot; The entire album describes an abused child as he developes into a man and grows into the dysfunctional individual that he eventually becomes. To read down the track titles of the 2 disc set can only verbally describe the horror that he has endured. He has eventually employed every escape tatic that he has in his arsenal to dull the ultimate pain. &quot;Run like Hell&quot; &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, these songs only lightly, vaguely describe the methods of self preservation that &quot;Pink&quot; employs to keep himself sane, yet at what expense? That, I suppose, is the question that we all have to ask the child in each one of us. <br />~DJPrimal
B000099T2L|1.0|The fact that this won 5 Grammys speaks on the state of music, the joke that the Grammys have become, and what stylish packaging can do. Her voice is better than the likes of Britney Spears yet I found Britney's album to be more entertaining minus the even more limited vocals-- this coming from an R&amp;B fan. Like Ashanti, her song-writing ability is elementary. The difference is, with acts like Ashanti you are not set up to expect much. It is what it is, like it or leave it. Beyonce, on the other hand, has been branded a 'diva' as if she is a standard for the new crop of singers. Sporting high heels and weave doesn't make a diva. This album is garbage.
0671646788|5.0|Not only is this book good for people persuing a career in management but it is also good for people that have not entered or are about to enter the work force.  The recommendations in this book are easy to follow and are beneficial to even the most experienced management personnell.  I purchased this book in 1996 and have read it at least once a year since then.  It can really make a difference with an individuals academic, work and personal goals.
B000084T18|5.0|This cd is for real a damn good cd. Every song on this album is a good piece of hip hop and 50 got some real good skills. I love this cd!
B000068G9X|4.0|This is THE hard rock album to own. If you want aggressive vocals and a good rock guitar sound that doesn't sound like radio garbage, try this. It's classic early Danzig, raw, primitive and unpolished but in a good way.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie is a modern take on classic kung-fu movies.  It would seem to me that the only people who understand this are the ones who are fans of kung-fu movies, or able to see when something is supposed to be a certain way for a certain reason.<br />Throughout the movie people lose limbs and shoot blood like crazy.  I have heard complaints that it is cheasy and un-realistic.  ok, time to get out of your box people.  The reason it is like that is because that is how the old samurai and kung-fu movies are.  This theme is demonstrated throughout along with the music and sound effects.<br />Kill Bill v.1 is non-stop action.  From beginning to end it grips you into the story; which is very intriguing in itself.  The story is great, and the film being shot out of sequence in chapter form makes you pay attention to what is going on even more.  <br />My advice would be not to see Kill Bill v.2 before seeing v.1.  Because they are actually one whole movie done in two parts.  Because KB2 is more story line than action it may turn you away.  KB2 is more enjoyabe after seeing the KB1 and you are already pulled into the story.
B000002IZ4|4.0|I love the video for &quot;Vasoline&quot;, its so weird and cool! The song is just as cool. Interstate Love Song is another stand-out. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A cowboy space story?  I wondered about that.  Then I saw the DVD's.  I wish that I had seen the show when it was out.  This is a wonderful ensemble piece, with dramatic action adventure coupled with great dry humor, and steeped with intriguing sexuality.  The characters unfold, the stories compel, and the feeling of a personal higher standard among this lot of independent thinkers coupled with their underworld dealings is very interesting.  However, I have to say that it is the movie like quality to the cinemetography that made the purchase of this DVD collection rewarding.   The careful framing of images really helps the storytelling.  I love the texture, the unusual points of view, and the juxtaposition of disparate objects.  Unlike most TV, it makes you feel like you've read a great book.  Love it.  I hope that these shows are the beginning (the series was cancelled - wah!) of some fine movies.
B000003TA4|5.0|I have all the Nirvana albums, and this one is their best. Back in the early '90s, Smells Like Teen Spirit became the anthem of the grunge generation. Grunge and the later more refined version of grunge, known as Alternative, brought rock music back to the forefront in a big way, with albums like Nevermind. To give this band or album a one-star rating just because you perceive in your brain that they had some bad influence on music is retarded. Judge the music on the music, man. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\"
0060278234|5.0|Lirael is one of the best books I've read in a while. However, I recommend that you read these books in order. I started out with Lirael and then read Sabriel. It was still good though. I was very sad when I read Abhorsen...I didn't want it to end. It would be a wise choice to buy this book, it will  be a good investment. Lirael's story pulls you in and you sympathise and also speculate what it is she is meant for if not the Clayr's visionary world. You have to read it to find out....
B0000027RL|5.0|A decade later, and Ten still remains Pearl jam's best-selling album thanks to the commercialism which they so opposed for their future releases. I believe music videos are an artform in itself, and I couldn't quite understand why Vedder and gang were so opposed to it. Anyway, enough of that, this is a great album. the song Jeremy is etched into our collective psyche I think, and I think Pearl jam will go down in history as one of the alternative kings.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B000059PR5|5.0|November 1983 - in High School and watching with someone I desperately wanted to be my girlfriend.  During the actual attack she cried in my arms as I saw in disbelief that horrific &quot;x-ray&quot; effect of people being disintegrated during the attack.  Dating was suddenly the last thing on my mind.<br />In a bit of dramatic irony, the day AFTER &quot;The Day After,&quot; the Grucci Fireworks factory on Long Island exploded, killing two people.  It was only a few miles away and cracked my bedroom window and prompted the same girl who was with me to call, crying hysterically because she thought that the boom was &quot;it.&quot;  When a movie moves you THAT much, it must be worth something.<br />If you've never seen it, see it.  Even if you are &quot;pro Military&quot; like me (I was a US Marine), it's worth seeing if only to remind you of the power you have and why people want to see &quot;restraint&quot; when it comes to flaunting that power.
B000068GA4|5.0|These are brilliant songs, from the blasphemous &quot;Snakes of Christ&quot;, to the ballad &quot;Her Black Wings&quot;, and so on, this is a dark gothic awesome cd. At this time lead singer and songwriter Glenn Danzig was obsessed with demonology and darkness. In fact, he rarely came out in the daytime. His skin was so pale it made Casper the Friendly Ghost look tanned. He has big muscles and sings with a deep Elvis Presley-esque voice in some songs and a higher pitch in others. He writes love songs so half his fan base is female, and industrial hardcore rock, which is why half his fan base is male.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
185984054X|5.0|I was a volunteer for the Missionaries of Charity at their &quot;Gift of Peace&quot; hospice in Washington, D.C.  Christopher Hitchens's account of how places like this are run rings true with my own experience.  For example, I was tending to an AIDS patient who had to go to the bathroom and I needed serious assistance.  None was to be found because the sisters were at their prayers.  It may strike some as strange that the nuns were attending to a god they cannot see while neglecting the poor man (who ended up leaving a quite visible souvenir of their neglect in his bed), but such are the lives of those who end up in such places. <br />Hitchens does a great job of documenting in this thin book the dictators and flim-flam artists who used Mother Teresa's iconographic presence to lend a patina of divine approval to their nefarious deeds.  That Mother's approach to misery was to counsel others, especially the poor who usually had no other choice, to offer it up, rather than seeking to eliminate or ameliorate it, comes through loud and clear.  The most egregious hypocrisy:  Mother's houses reject such creature comforts for the poor as air conditioning and elevators for the handicapped and, most telling of all, adequate pain medication.  But Mother Teresa herself was treated at some of the finest medical facilities in the world.  To take vows of poverty in imitation of Jesus is one thing; it is quite another to insist that those you purport to serve must share in your misery.<br />This is an honest book.  Some may conclude that it is derivative from the author's anti-religion bias.  I very much doubt it.  Rather, from the evidence amassed herin, as well as by such other scandels that the Church has (unsuccessfully, finally) tried to cover up, there may be some very good reasons for people to conclude that it is precisely when living vessels of clay are raised to altars around the world, it is a darn good time to check your wallet or pocketbook.
B0000C1733|5.0|The Red Hot Chilli Peppers are a bunch of fun-loving guys who wear socks on their penises in concert and don't like to wear shirts. They've been around a lot longer than anyone realizes too. The lead singer has tattoos all over his body and the music is a unique blend of reggae, rock, pop, and folk ballad. Now do yourself a favor and get this hits album.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B00005JMEW|5.0|All I have to say is &quot;Watch the Kill Bill Vol. 1 Uncut Version as well.&quot;  The uncut is only offered in Asia and Europe, and it's by far more intensive action.  More footage of blood and action was added to the theatre version.  I like the Theatre version but the real version is showing his artistic directing.<BR>P.S.  No Black and White during the Action Part of the Movie.
B000002MP2|5.0|This was my favorite album in high school. The songs just kick ayyyyyysh! I just listened to Basket Case so many times, I soon became one &lt;g&gt;<br />Dookie is a classic, it shall never die.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Robert Johnson never had a band.  It was just him and his guitar.  I think that is one thing that stands out the most about Robert Johnson.  If Clapton wanted to do a great Johnson album it would have been just him and his guitar.
B000002MY3|5.0|This is a brilliant album even just for the lyrics. Alanis Morrisette is such an articulate and interesting personality and a very talented singer and songwriter, no doubt about that, and her lyrics are fantastic. I hear she's also writing a novel and movie script. Is there anything she can't do??<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B00005N5S5|4.0|Before watching this movie, I expected it to be that shallow piece of nonstop action kind of movies we had seen in some of the newer Shwartzenegger movies.  This film truely shocked me.  First of all, the story was great.  James Cameron really does a wonderful job on any film he does.  The acting was wonderful, especially Linda Hamilton.  This wasn't average, or mediocre.  It was really good.  One of my favorite action movies.  See this movie.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|No one does &quot;melodic&quot; better than Maiden. Even now I still can't get &quot;Dance of Death&quot; and &quot;Passiondale&quot; (sp?) out of my head. Great tunes. Many of the other songs are very very good too. What's interesting about Maiden overall is that I always get a sense that I'm listening to songs that were written hundreds of years ago or decades ago, like old Medieval folk tunes about the Devil or Icarus or WW1 or WW2 songs like Passendale or Aces High, that were re-vamped into metal or rock versions in our modern age. It's really weird and interesting. I can't even begin to put in words how talented this band is from the technical songwriting viewpoint.<br />p.s. the chorus part on Montisgur f*ckin' kicks!<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B0000BWVCM|4.0|Rarely do I like sequels over the original films.  Sequels tend to lack richness, development, and quality (Cadyshack 2, Rocky II, etc) but X-2 really impressed me.  Hugh Jackman deepened his role as Wolverine and made him less mysterious.  Anna Paquin also improved.  Other characters in the film stayed the same, but they weren't in need of change (Storm, Mystique) All in all the film definately improved.  The first film wasn't horrible in any aspect, but the sequel definately outshined its predecessor.  One of the best films of 2003.
B000002UY5|4.0|This is that band whose lead singer died in a heroin overdose just months after giving an interview where he spoke about heroin's deadly effects and how he was addicted in the past. He died not long after Kurt Cobain's suicide. This band was a pretty righteous-looking group of neo-hippies. I really enjoyed their songs. This self-titled CD is a wonderful and overlooked gem. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B00000K19E|5.0|I love it when writers, producers, and directors dare to go outside the box and make a film that is unlike anything we have ever seen.  I dreaded not going to see this in theaters.  I waited until the DVD came out to rent it.  This is such a good movie.  It is almost hard to review because there is little to say about it, it is just good.  I do warn people, that don't like movies that are hard to follow to maybe not see this move.  You have to be very attentitive when watching this film.  You cannot take your eyes off of it.  All in all the movie is unlike anything that has ever been on celluloid.  One of the better films of 1999.

Julia Roberts and Richard Gere in a fantastic performance in the terrific romantic fairy tale, Pretty Woman.  Ed Lewis (Gere) is a very successful and wealthy businessman who gets lost on Hollywood Blvd and stops and asks Viv', a prostitute, for directions.  She shows him to his hotel for a price.  Ed then hires Viv's company for a week as an escort for some business events.  Ed, who is a charming, and handsome businessman, provides her with a penthouse suite, a visit to the opera, and a fabulous wardrobe.  Ed frees Viv from working the streets when he falls in love with her.
B00003CXAT|5.0|I love Jurassic Park.  It never gets old or boring.  I find myself watching it over and over.  It is definately one of my favorite sci-fi movies, hey it is probably my favorite.  The effects are dazzling.  This film is true cinamatic magic.  You really beleive that dinosaurs are walking in front of you.  The plot as well as the script is wonderful.  It doesn't seem like this type of movie could get so dramatic at times, but it does.  All the acting is wonderful.  See this movie before you die.  I deeply reccomend this film.  A true film masterpiece.
B000002LFL|5.0|I think this albus is awesome!!!<BR>I'd only complain about the setlist... all the songs here are just great!! but where is There is a light that never goes out? I also would have like to hear a live version of shelia take a bow. I recomend this to everyone!
B00006RCSU|4.0|It appears from other reviewers that I'm in the minority, but I loved this movie.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I'm not exactly thrilled with Claire Danes as Juliet.  She's adequate, nothing more, and when she has to cry, she is very bad.  But Leo, he definitely my idea of Romeo...and the guy who plays Mercutio is very good...the soundtrack, excellent...and the production is a very interesting and daring modern take on the play.  I think Baz Luhrman is a genius, and this is a very enjoyable adaptation of a classic play.  One fault I would point out is that sometimes you can't understand what the actors are saying because they are rushing, shouting and/or slurring their dialog.  But, overall, this re-invention of Romeo and Juliet in modern day is very good.
0671027387|4.0|This book is a great read!  While I agree that some of it seems a bit implausible if you stop and study it, I never found myself having a hard time believing it or being immersed in the book.  I read this one quickly - in about 2 days - and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good mystery.  Towards the end of the book you figure it out, and I personally wouldn't have given away as much info as the back cover does, but overall a great read, especially if you buy the paperback (which is only $7 or so).<br />I gave this book 4 stars because 5 stars means the book is darn near perfect and I reserve that rating for MUST-READ books.<br />If you're looking for a few other books, try PREY and/or THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN by Michael Crichton - I just got through reading PREY and it's pretty good too, and TAS is a classic.
B00004RF9B|4.0|'Forbidden Planet' is an enjoyable science fiction film, even though the graphic and acting may seem dated.  As the film progresses, one will realize it is actually a study of human psychology.  See if you can spot Leslie Neilson.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|Well, first off, I can spell so everyone can understand my review.<BR>Pink's album, is probably the best yet. I listen to it several times throughtout the day. Yes, she does cuss throughout the CD, but she's trying to get the point across. If you take offence to her music, I don't understand why you are listening to it in the first place. Misunderstood was an alright album, but this one is a more hard core to the point one. It doesn't beat around the bush about topics, it gets to the point. If you want something like that, this is the one to buy. I don't think she was on drugs as she recorded this album, its just a new song she has created and I love it. Her last album sounded a little to pop for me and that's probably why some people like that one more. n'sync is dead! If you are looking for something to relate to, this is the album to get! Enjoy!!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This film is great for all the wrong reasons! The profanity, the drugs, the violence...INCREDIBLE! Pacino is a hoot with the thick accent and who can forget the tiger at the wedding! There are more lines in this film than in a stack of Mead notebooks. Michelle Pfeiffer is fab as a coke snorting dingbat.
B000001GQT|3.0|Whenever I hear of the most popular work by Richard Strauss, this recording comes to my mind. So, I went to check out the hype. When I heard the famed &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; theme the Einlentung, I was blown away. Definetely the best Einlentung out there. The rest of Also Sprach Zarathrustra is less tham impressive later on. Typical of Karajan, this Zarathustra is saturated with strings with little clarity for winds and brass. Quite puzzling, since my last Karajan experience, the Salome recording for EMI, was quite a contrast to this recording. There's more passion in Reiner's 1960 Zarathrustra remake (considered a just decent compared to Reiner's landmark 1954 recording). <br />I can think of some recordings better than this Zarathrustra. For clarity and bombast, Willaim Steinberg with Boston Symphony Orchestra is a must grab (along with a classic Holst's &quot;The Planets&quot;). It is one of the most fastest Zarathrustra, at 29 minutes, but Steinberg brings out multitude of details I hear compared to most famous Zarathrustra recordings, and you want the lushness of Karajan's Berliner strings? The Bostoners ain't lacking them either, plus the solo violinist is cheekier than Michel Schwalbe. Bohm's recording with the same orchestra is much better, with the his Dance-Song at the most Viennese. Back to this recording, the only decent account here is the Don Juan and Salome's Seven Veils Dance, with humor-less Till Eusphiegel. The Einlentung here is the only redeeming feature if you want to test your boombox.
B000000OSE|4.0|After waiting 4 years to release a follow-up to the fantastic Appetite For Destruction, GNR released a double set of albums together. They were called Use Your Illusion. This album, UYI1, is not as ear-blasting rock n roll as Appetite. It is actually quite bluesy. There is nothing wrong with that, but I think on some songs, they take the blues influence too far. many of the songs are absolutely fabulous, like Right Next Door To Hell, Dust N Bones, and Garden of Eden, but some are weak and filler like You Ain't The First and Don't Cry. Although the latter was a huge Top 40 smash, I still don't like it. It sounds lame. anyway i thought this is a cool album and any hard rock fan should get it. For fans of heavier stuff, go get Appetite.

B00005RY7X|5.0|The savior of heavy metal! Just when metal was at its darkest, drowned out by horrible nu metal bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit, Andrew arrives on the scene, with ear-damaging, screaming rock n roll. He  mixes dance pop with pure screaming metal on this album. I love the synthesizers mixes with Andrew's screaming and thunderous guitars. He shows that it it possible to save a genre from itself, Influncing bands like Jet and the Darkness. he truly is obsessed with partying and fun, which is nice because it can lift you up when your'e sad. The lyrics are happy and peppy, and so is the music. If you love alternative and nu metal, you cannot buy this. if you hate it just as much as I do, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001611DI|5.0|This movie was made in the late 70's but it's still a great movie. Unlike the new one this one only has 4 people and that is great because theres not alot of people to keep up with. It's also funny in some parts. The zombies are slow, thats good on the peoples hand, They guys who live in the mall get to loot it and stay for a month insted of 7 days. This is a great movie to have in your zombie collction
6305388458|4.0|This is Monty Python's masterpiece.  That's well known, so I won't go on about that here.  However, if you're a fan of the movie, you'll definitely want to consider the Criterion Collection edition (also in the Amazon.com catalog), which has lots of great features.  However, it'll cost you a bit more.
B0001IN080|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable movie, and pretty good cd.<BR>The time flew watching Buble' singing and interacting with his fans. To listen to him sing is to watch a great artist at work.<BR>I am buying more of these wonderful packages as gifts for friends and co-workers who need their lives uplifted.
B00005B4GU|3.0|what is with you people, how can you make a comparison between Kid A and Amnesiac, in which is better. Amnesiac fit's a B-side project more than anything in my book rather than an actual album. And honestly you all can't lie. Kid A was a true album, it was a foundation of the Experimental Radiohead, Amnesiac is just a b-sides compilation released by the band (if you ask me)-due to the fact that they wanted to begin touring and promoting themselves again, and this album supplied our needs after Kid A while Radiohead was touring until the release of a real album, Hail to the Thief. Don't get me wrong, Amnesiac is a great record but it has no true soul, just a collection of songs rejected off Kid A. Kid A was meant for ear-candy/visual inspiration, what picture does Amnesiac paint for us. Nothing, just how much more stuff RAdiohead can make. And seriously, Kid A, one can listen to entirely, Amnesiac I don't think so. Everything on Kid A was mind blowing madness, and chaos that still put a grin on your face. Amnesiac you have to keep your fingers near the skip button to avoid annoyance from tracks likes: Life in A Glass House (good song, bad music), Hunting Bears, and the most annoying, Morning Bell/Amnesiac song. God that song is drill heavy, I loved Kid A version, how it begins right after the panicky Idioteque and sobers down. Pyramid Song is the best on this compilation. and by the way, as far as art goes, Stanely Donwood didn't deliver well on Amnesiac. And unlike Kid A, everything wasn't in it's right place on this record.
B00005JMEW|4.0|If you want to know the plot, watch the movie... it is great!!! Or just read the longer reviews.<br />The only thing that I don't like about this movie, is the black and white during the fight scene at the end.  I think it is crap that it is not in color.  It wasn't intended to be in black and white because I saw it in Japan IN COLOR!!!!!  It takes away from the art of the film and I am unpleased with it. I was expecting to see what I saw at the theatre, but it isn't same without the color.  I wish they would have at least put the original version on the DVD... I guess I will have to find out if other countries have the color version.<br />It is a fine piece of work by QT and should be able to be seen in the original version that he intended and created.
B00004XONN|5.0|alright, it's simple, if you've heard of Radiohead but don't own anything by them yet, buy ok computer first and then this. If you're already a fan of Radiohead, then you probably already know the story. I hate to say this but, Paul Lansky (the guy responsible for the sample used by Radiohead on IDIOTEQUE, made this album sound just a tad more wholesome if it weren't for him. I actually own the 18 minute piece by him, it's weird but beautiful, and I get a kick out of hearing the beginning where Radiohead had looped the song at. You can call me an IDIOTEQUE freak, I own all the live vid's, mp3's, midi's, originals and the actual rare IDIOTEQUE single, I even made my own personal video for it too! I listen to alot of Aphex Twin and Autechre but, Radiohead beats them with this simple but complex, head-spinning song. TOO BAD AMAZON ONLY LETS YOU LISTEN TO THE FIRST FIVE TRACKS, cuz IDIOTEQUE will make you a believer. this album was trully inspiring, and everything on it and about was in its right place and time.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|My bemused friends. This is the 516th review of this album and of the previous 515 reviews none are truly helpful. Therfore, after reading numerous of these reviews, I am going to analyze their findings and make recommendations accordingly.<br /><br />The reason for the wildly varying opinions of Train of Thought, is because with this CD, Dream Theater is entering a new phase on their musical evolution. They have prudently and rightly ascertained that to keep recording, what is basically the same material, is effectively a death sentence.<br /><br />So, What do we have here? Well it looks like about 20 % of the reviewers (one and two stars) who professed to be die hard fans were shocked by the new Dream Theater and subsequently hated TOT. Obviously if you as a potential buyer are dogmatic and are looking for the same old (but still very good) sound, you shouldn't buy TOT.<br /><br />The next group we have (Three stars) is the ones who don't know what to make of TOT. They don't seem to rushing to judgement (though they've written reviews) and are somewhat ambivalent. About 15% of our reviewers felt this way and I was one of these people at first but after multiple listens became a fan. That's right, I think TOT takes multiple listens to appreciate but let's face it isn't DT worth multiple listens. What else are we going to listen to, Beyonce? So if you are this kind of person, you should go ahead and buy TOT. Worse case, it won't grow on you and you end up with a mediocre album but the upside is worth it.<br /><br />Next (four stars) at about 25% is the group that appreciates TOT and DT's latest endeavor and their need to experiment and grow and voice opinions that although TOT is not DT's best or second best or even third best album it is a very good album in it's own right. Again if I may be redundant, what are your options, Janet Jackson? OOPS!<br /><br />Lastly of course we have the true die hard DT fans (five stars), about 40%, who think TOT is great, one of their best and can't for the life of them, understand how anyone could not love this album and say so in their reviews. I kinda side with them but I can understand where the other groups are coming from. I guess I'm in between groups three and four at about 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br /><br />If you like the old Dream Theater just fine, thank you, and do not wish to experiment on a newer and slightly heavier DT - PASS<br /><br />If you are not as rigid but think you may like the old DT better - IT'S YOR CALL, it's still Dream Theater!<br /><br />If you are flexible and open to new stuff, especially from DT - ABSOLUTELY!<br /><br />If you are an extreme, die hard Dream Theater fan. You probably have it already.<br /><br />MY BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Dream Theater is the most visable, most revered and best known of all PROG ROCK/METAL bands. By being the number one progressive band in the world they have been anointed to carry the torch through the dark passages of mundane popular music. Though they are not my personal favorite Progressive band, I do love them and feel for them as they carry a heavy burden. Long Live Dream Theater. You may not like the alternative.m, understand how anyone could not love this album and say so in their reviews. I kinda side with them but I can understand where the other groups are coming from.

Their self-titled debut, which most people don't even ever hear, is one of the most underrated albums ever made.

B000002TLX|5.0|I just recently got this cd cuz a friend recommended it to me. I am only 19 so a lot of the songs i never heard previously. I do remember Don't mean nothing, Should've known better, Right here waiting, Hold on to the nights, and Endless summer nights though. Those are my favorite songs. Richard Marx has such a great voice! This is one cd i will listen to often.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|IMO this is one of the best metal cds ever. A bold statement, but thats not to say that this is the best and only great metal cd in history. But its right up there with them. A vocalist that has one of the best voices ive ever heard, from the most breathtaking clean/soaring vocals to the most brutal screams. A guitarist that has some of most fitting riffs and solos seen in years. A drummer that belts it out flawlessly song after song. A bassist that is a backbone of the band along with all the others, rather than just being a shadow in the background. All that and the one of the strongest 1 hour and 9 minutes of musi ive heard in as long as i can remember.<BR>I suggest buying this and Killswitch Engague's &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;, From Autumn To Ashes &quot;Too Bad Your Beautiful&quot;, Atreyu's &quot;Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses&quot; and As I Lay Dying's &quot;Frail Words Collapse&quot;.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|When I first heard that they were making a Lord of the Rings movie, I was surprised.  I thought that no matter what they did, they couldn't do any justice to the books.  But Peter Jackson surpised me.  Once I watched the movie I went out and bought the companion cd.  It was amazing, and for each movie, I bought the cd that went with it.  <br />This cd is my favorite.  I can't listen to it enough, whether it is listening to the awe inspiring instrumental music, or if it is listening to Annie Lennox's heart lifting song, this cd is absolutely great and if you like either the movie or instrumental music, I highly recommend this cd to music lovers.

B0001DI0FI|3.0|Well, this was a pretty good movie... I mean, a lot of action, British accents, ships, etc. Not a lot of female characters. However, the movie really took an interesting turn after the \\"lesser than two weevil's\\" joke.  It was a decent pun by Russell Crowe, who is the Master and Commander of the boat, which is probably some inspiration for the title.  However, the officers laughed an awful lot at the pun; in fact, excessive in my opinion.  This was okay, but the weevil joke resurfaced again later in the movie and that was really the straw that broke the camel over the back for me.  There was a long scene at the end where everyone fights and also some Francais but I felt the damage had already been done.
B00008AWOG|5.0|This is a concept album and a sad one.  Which is right up Opeth's alley.  It's about a lost love named Melinda, of a man kicked out of town and so on.  It's very melencollie and sad.  And it's classic Opeth.  They are the masters of contrast.  One minute brutal and heavy and the next, acoustic and singing beautifully.  And the songs are all long, like they should be.<br />Plus the cover art is cool.  Get this album today!
0140288503|1.0|Stunningly shallow and simplistic!!<BR>This book is a total waste of time. It is a shallow, naive, simplistic, shoot-'em-up, rah-rah and surprisingly tedious account of a tragic event.  It is poorly written to boot!  There is virtually no analysis of what was going on in Somalia.  No explanation is offered of why the United States had troops committed there.  There is no attempt to even ask the questions of why the US became vilified and hated by the Somalis.<BR>This \\"journalist\\" furthermore exposes his own pathetic agenda throughout the book.  He constantly hammers away at \\"weak kneed Washington politicians\\" (read - Democrats from Bill Clinton back to John F. Kennedy) while never mentioning (or even distorting the fact) that it was George H. W. Bush who sent the troops there originally with an ill-defined plan and virtually no exit strategy.<BR>In his Epilogue he engages in considerable self-congratulations that is embarrassing even to read.  He apparently thinks he is making some profound observations, while his whole account is sophomoric at best.  His graphic descriptions of the soldiers' death agonies (brains spilling out, testicles blown off, femoral arteries spewing blood, etc.) is a disgrace and worthy of the \\"National Enquirer\\".  This can only have added untold sadness to the families and friends of those lost.  These accounts are even more despicably sensationalistic in light of the Pentagon and White House's current policy of suppressing respectful pictures of coffins returning from Iraq for fear of upsetting the families and demeaning those who died.  <BR>War is terrible.  These soldiers were \\"peacekeepers\\", yet they were both feared and hated by those they were supposedly there to help.  The Somalis were dehumanized as \\"Sammies\\" and \\"skinnies\\", and Mogadishu is constantly described as a dump.  What is worse- driving repeatedly over Somali bodies in HumVees and the indiscriminate mass murder of innocent Somalis or dragging bodies of dead soldiers throughthe streets.  Or are they equally horrific and reprehensible?  The issue apparently never even occurs to the author.<BR>The loss of the 18 soldiers was and is a terribly tragic event.  This author does them no honor.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I myself like to look at the bad reviews for things and this was no exception, and somtimes i just didn't understand. On one review the person states that this was another typical GI Joe movie with a happy ending. And even though the ending was relatively &quot;happy&quot; this is not just another GI Joe war movie this movie is about a Band Of Brother as stated in the title. I also look at the fact that the movie ended on a peaceful sunny day. That doesn't make it a happy ending, many of their friends or even better, BROTHERS had died and that is not HAPPY AT ALL! Enough said though this is the best miniseries ever created and I encourage you to buy it even though it is expensive for it is most definetly worth it.
0671027387|2.0|WARNING: CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS<br />I finished another Dan Brown novel this weekend, but now I'm confused.<br /><br />Which one is it that has a wonderful amount of technical information but is so very plot heavy?  It's the one where the main non-protagonist good guy turns about to be the main bad guy about 90% through the book and the obvious villain turns out to be good. You know, the one where the boy and girl who just met fall in love and sleep together at the end . . .<br /><br />Oh wait, that's all of them.
B000065PUE|5.0|Ask anyone who knows their stuff and chances are, they got at least one Pixies album in their collection. I don't care if you like Iron Maiden, Sonic Youth, Peter Frampton, Jimi Hendrix, Yngwie Malsteem, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Slayer, Joy Division, NIN, Beach Boys or The Cure.  The Pixies are just too damn good not to get into.<br />The striking thing is, &quot;Doolittle&quot; doesn't have a song that sucks or lacks character. Frank Black still up to this day has one of the most chameleon-styled voices ever. &quot;Wave of Mutliation&quot; pretty much covers a wide variety of grunge in all it's charming likeness where &quot;Hey&quot; bounces, oozing with dark humor. &quot;Debaser&quot;, the opening song served as a template for many post modern hard rock acts to follow. &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot; and &quot;No.13 Baby&quot; were inspiring anthems for a generation of listeners who wanted something more than all the ho-hum mainstream music of the 80's. Kim Deal's voice compliments Black's tenor almost effortlessly in &quot;Silver&quot;.<br />There is a particular reason, listener keep coming back and why people are now just getting to know who the heck this great band was. They forever shaped the music to come in the 90's, yes Kurt Cobain, the SUPPOSE icon of late 20th century music even admitted it. &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; and &quot;Trompe Le Monde&quot; are both excellent listens, but &quot;Doolittle&quot; capitivates the most distinguished sound of the Pixies. <br />It's just too hard to not think of these guys without thinking of this one. Please, put aside Good Charlotte, Linkin Park, Simple Plan, Yellowcard, The White Stripes, The Darkness and listen to a band worth knowing about. Then again, who the hell am I kidding, no one ever listens to these things.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|It's hard to believe three dudes can make such a huge and diverse sound without sounding ridiculous. Some might argue they do and to be fair they are treading a fine line that boarder's outright genius and some kind of mental illness.<BR> <BR>On the other hand, I think that's got to be the trick when the boundaries of music are being tested and I dare say pushed back. I personally can't help coming back for more, it's just such fulfilling listening and so satisfying to know these guys really have given it everything they humanly can and a lot more. This record deserves attention, if not for its density or complexity or skilled execution or passion, then for outrageous ambition. <br />All you need is an open mind and a pair of ears, believe me you most likely won't regret it!

B0001AVZA8|3.0|If &quot;About Schmidt&quot; proved Jack Nicholson could still disappear into a character and knock him out of the park, &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; proves he can, well, turn back into Jack. <br />Nicholson grins and preens and struts his way around this movie, a gentleman diva trying to rescue an overloaded plot and Diane Keaton from a rather stale performance, awarded as she was for it. Nancy Meyers' follow-up to &quot;What Women Want&quot; is better suited to the elder crowd, though Meyers panders to youth's twin peaks of materialism and beauty worship by casting Amanda Peet and Keanu Reeves. <br />Nicholson is Harry, a music mogul who's into chasing the short skirt, preferably one half his age, with bangs and perky expression - like Marin (Peet), art auctioneer. The two head to Marin's mother's ocean house in The Hamptons where, predictably, Harry is discovered, in his boxers, by Marin's mother, Erica (Keaton), an acclaimed playwright although, when we see her dialogue later, it's not exactly Arthur Miller.<BR> <BR>Erica objects to Marin's choice, Harry tosses off a few salvos and grins at dinner, and before Harry and Marin can consummate their courtship, Harry keels and has heart attack. <br />Harry's prescription: He has to recover in Erica's house. And the doctor who ordered that prescription, played by Reeves, is a fan - and maybe more - of Erica. The heart attack offers a glimpse of mortality to Harry. He decides, at long last - he needs someone in his own decade with whom to share. <br />Meyers trades in dissecting fears of the alpha male - &quot;What Women Want&quot; and &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; - and the career woman - &quot;Baby Boom.&quot; In &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; she tries to pull those two personas into a relationship and makes two errors: Working with Keaton for a fourth time and saddling her with Reeves, hilariously cast as a hunk doctor who brings baskets of peaches by in the morning.<br />Keaton is borderline creepy, certainly a drag. And, well, playwrights can be. But Keaton never burns off the frigidness of her first scenes. It is &quot;Annie Hall?&quot; Not quite. It's closer to her performance in Woodys Allen's masterwork, &quot;Manhattan.&quot; You know, the one where she gets left in the end. Either way, she's no match or spark for Jack. Frances McDormand, who plays Erica's sister, Zoe, in a cameo, was the right actress. Surprisingly enough, Peet is quite good as the sweet, plucky Marin. You'd much rather spend a day with her than her mother.  <br />And unlike &quot;What Women Want,&quot; which genuinely concerned itself with advertising, Harry and Erica's careers mostly run along the stream of romantic hijinks, like dogs. Being powerful and wealthy would partially explain Harry's interest in women who are okay with short-term flings; the mogul business doesn't suit itself to spouses for very long.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Everything blends and flows into each measure so well that you can imagine what the score pertains to as it precedes.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Holy Moly..what a ride! This movie didn't disappoint. Yes, I love all of QT's movies, but this really stands alone as a great cinematic masterpiece as well as a good story. The use of anime was a great bonus and made the movie have such a different feel from anything else out there.  You'll recognize so many genres on this DVD, your head will spin, especially if you were a teenager in the 70's. Uma is at her best--looking all angles and curves as she goes for her prey. The supporting cast is a blast and the sound track, groovy as usual. I didn't even find the gore a problem at all. Somehow it's over-the-top 'pop' gave everything such a surreal quality that my eyes stayed open. I waited for this to come on DVD but really should have seen it on the big screen. We'll proudly put this next to \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction on the Fave Movie shelf!
B000089RVX|5.0|\\"Fallen\\" clearly is the best album of 2003. When I bought the album, I wasn't thinking twice about the other songs besides \\"Bring Me To Life\\". \\"Bring Me To Life\\" turns out to be one of my least favorite songs off of Fallen.<br />Fallen is a small album with 11 tracks. It starts off with Going Under (9.5/10) which is a dark, hard rock song about coming from a bad relationship. I love the piano playing in the background. The second track on the album is the #1 hit Bring Me To Life (9/10) which eventually gets boring after hearing it 1,000,000 times. I prefer the original recording without Paul McCoy. You can hear a 30 second clip at [...]<BR>The current single is Everybody's Fool (9/10) which isn't that great. It's about how awful pop stars are. While Everybody's Fool hasn't received much airplay, everyone loves My Immortal (10/10). My Immortal was the second #1 hit from Fallen. Sadly, Going Under did very poorly as a single. My Immortal is a ballad about being haunted by a loved one. I like the album version because you see Amy Lee's true vocal talent and piano playing. Speaking of being haunted, the fifth track is Haunted (10/10) which is a dark song. My favorite part of Haunted is the guitar solo near the end. Haunted really grew on me.<br />To every rule, there has to be at least one acception. The acception is Tourniquet (6/10). The lyrics are awfully strange. This song really shows how much better of songwriters Amy and Ben are then Rocky Gray (he wrote this song for Soul Embraced I think, he's in like 4 different bands)<br />The best song on the album is Imaginary (12/10) which has violins in the beginning and gets faster. I love the guitars and violins in Imaginary. Imaginary is a real great fantasy song and I wish it were the fourth single, like Amy wanted.<br />Following Imaginary is Taking Over Me (10/10) which is a love song that has a rock twist. I don't have very much to say about it. I love the notes Amy hits in the bridge. It's a very similar song to Bring Me To Life and My Last Breath. The other ballad on the album is Hello (9/10) which is about being forgotten about. It's the second worst on the album, but it's still a good song. The third ballad and rock twist is My Last Breath (11/10) which is the second best song. I think it's a romantic song with something about suicide in it. I never quite got the message.<br />The ending track is Whisper (10/10) which is my third favorite. The choir in the end was a very unique idea. <br />After reading my review, I hope you want to go out and buy it right now. You're really missing out if you don't buy it.
B0000630YA|3.0|After breaking up with the Alice Cooper group, and going solo, Alice hired a band with, effectively, no musical limitations. These guys could literally play anything. And so Alice pretty much let the theatricality take over. The result is the soundtrack to a Broadway show that never was: the best marriage of hard rock and showtunes ever. Listen to \\"Black Widow\\" for example. The song itself is pure Broadway, but the instrumentation is pure heavy metal. Alice was showing his love for showtunes as early as \\"Easy Action\\" the Alice Cooper group's second album, which featured a medley of snippets from \\"West Side Story.\\" This West Side Story theme would be reprised in greater depth on \\"School's Out\\" (the Alice Cooper group's worst album.) But on this album he really marries hard rock and musical theatre. Many of these songs were probably written with the costumes, props and dance routines of the live show already in mind.
0679746048|5.0|If I could give this book 6 stars I would! Right from the opening this book grips the reader with facinating therioes of live and incrediable thought process. For example the view of attempted suicide as 'brave and couragous', or even the tag line &quot;Sometimes we have to go a little razy just to stay sane&quot;. An amazing book worthy of many awards. A must read for any teenager questioning life. <br />Susanna Kaysen is a true gift to this world!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|If you have heard negative criticism of this movie, please don't listen! Clear your mind. Go in with an open mind ready to receive a favorable impression!<br />Why this plea?!?! Well, I was quite depressed when my 20-something year old friends panned the movie & said it was one of the worst ever.<br />If you are brand new to O'Brian & his works, then it may help for you to understand a few things. O'Brian was a tireless historian & naturalist. Every battle in his books (not those in the movie, though) were battles that really happened with the 19th century British Navy. All the details of the ship build, the meals eaten, the language, the countries visited, etc. are all true to the times. And, thankfully, the movie has been very faithful to this detail.<br />However, I think my friends were confusing the glimpse we get at this distant culture with their modern day version of life. For instance, in the movie the captain makes a truly shameless pun which WAS said at the time...it shows you the kind of humor the sailors used to get through their tough life. However, my friends took that to be the humor of the movie itself, which is a very different thing. The humor in the script is a very subtle one based on character development & understanding.<br />So, that all said, I think the movie was absolutely fantastic. You have to pay attention some to see where minor characters are developed, where dialogue is important, and where subtle themes are brought through the movie (which you can do with many viewings of the DVD). But, if you do, I don't think you will be disappointed. I think Weir does a masterful job of bringing together great action scenes & fine, tender themes. <br />As for the cast:<br />- Crowe was a flawless Captain Aubrey. He really makes the movie, and everything hangs on his performance. You believe in his integrity, his care & his grit. <BR>- Bettany was a very good match as the doctor. He showed both the strength of his personality (a good balance for Aubrey) and also his neurotic weaknesses. <BR>- Boyd (a plug for the LOTR actor) did quite admirably in a very different role for him. Rather than act as the ignorant mischief-maker (Pippen), he is the go-to sailor. He is there at crunch-time & is fully reliable. He seems to have enjoyed this role & filled it well.<BR>- The rest of the crew filled in their places admirably in order for you to be truly absorbed in this tale.<br />And, finally, perhaps one of the most riveting aspects that they captured so well was the ship's delicate constitution - not the boat but the crew. They had to bear tight quarters, extreme weather, sickness, lack of food, battles & traumatic losses - all while staying strong & preparing for the next challenge. I thought this movie did a phenomenal job in showing how the sailors and officers lived & survived emotionally in such a world. (And the sound track draws this out beautifully as well!)
630245333X|3.0|The Blob is a fun movie.  It is nothing more.  It is nothing less.  It won't win any awards for acting or plot, but then it  was never really meant to.  You see, this '80s remake of the 1950-something [ahem] &quot;classic&quot; is really just a ridiculous b-movie with fancy special effects.<br />The plot is almost as absurd as the title, following what appears to be a colossal alien jelly as it rampages through an American town, munching on its inhabitants and generally being a bit of a nuisance.  Cue face melting, blood spurting and lots and lots of gore.<br />The acting is as cheesy as everything else in the movie, and the very idea of a psychotic blob murdering people is somewhat laughable, but as i already mentioned, this is an entertaining Saturday night horror film.
B0000062FL|4.0|Santana may have sacrificed his musical integrity for top ten hits in recent years, but Abraxas is still a crowning achievement in the unique guitarists extensive catalog of music. The band's eclectic blend of blues, afro-cuban poly rhythms and jazz sound absolutely stellar on Abraxas. From the Tito Puente classic &quot;Oye Coma Va&quot;, to the delicately beatiful samba ballad, &quot;Samba Pa Ti&quot;. The band's biggest hit was of course &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot;, even here Santana showed he could start a fire with pop hooks and experimentation,  he also proved he didn't need 20 matchboxes to get it started.
B000089CJI|5.0|I have to admit that when I first heard of The Postal Service the whole electronica part sort of turned me away.  But I decicded to keep an open mind.  A few downloads later and I couldn't wait to get a copy of the cd.  Theres not much to say except that the breezy melodic beats perfectly showcase Ben Gibbard's amazing vocals.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I'll be the first to admit I'm not the most astute film reviewer in the world, and I don't appreciate all the deep meanings behind a movie, but would someone please tell me what the fuss was about this film?<br />Two lonely people meet in Tokyo, both suffering from a lack of sleep and some serious culture shock. They meet, hang out, almost have an affair, and ...?<br />I guess I'm a dumb American, but what's the point? OK, I'll concede a couple of scenes were a little funny, but yikes, the movie as a whole was a snoozer. (...).
0486281523|5.0|Martin Gardner is the grand old man of puzzles and recreational mathematics. I recommend this book for intermediary and advanced puzzle enthusiasts - beginners might find some of these too challenging.<br />Intermediary puzzlists will find the pleasures of often working at the upper edge of their skills. The solutions at the end of the book are complete enough so that even those who didn't get it right the first time will get aha insights.<br />The book is well worth its price even for puzzle enthusiasts. Even I knew many of the puzzles beforehand - classics indeed - but the notes in the solutions often add a twist, a clever solution or a human interest point of view. <br />The age recommendation of amazon.com - 4-8 years - is probably either an insider joke or a typo. I'd recommend this book to people between 14-80 years of age, and even over.
B0000C1733|4.0|There's no doubt that the &quot;Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot; have been one of the funkiest bands of the past 20 years, but this 90's collection could have been a few songs better. Of course it's my opinion, but I don't think &quot;Universally Speaking&quot;, &quot;Road Trippin'&quot;, or &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; belong on here, they're good, but not greatest hits. If &quot;Aeroplane&quot;, &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot;, and &quot;Around The World&quot; were in their place, this would have been more complete. However, it's hard to complain when you get &quot;Give It Away&quot;, &quot;Soul To Squeeze&quot;, &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, and &quot;By The Way&quot; on the same disc. Plus one of the new tracks &quot;Fortune Faded&quot; is awesome. Overall this is good stuff, but I think I still like the 80's collection &quot;What Hits?&quot; even more.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill Volume 1, in my opinion, is a phenomenon. If you haven't seen this yet, then rent it immediately. I think everyone should experience this extremely awesome movie.<br />This movie begins violent, and ends the same. If you are squeamish, then you shouldn't see this movie, but for everyone else, you must see this. Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu are awesome villains, cursing and cutting their way into these new roles. I haven't heard Lucy Liu sound anything like her role as O-Ren Ishii. Vivica A. Fox is pretty funny, in a strange way as Vernita Green. But the most outstanding actress in this movie would most definitely be Uma Thurman as the woman looking for revenge against the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, her former workers. The DiVAS consist of O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and Bill (David Carradine). <br />There are really only two ultimately violent scenes in the movie, and they're both strictly edited. One is in animation and one is in black and white. The animation is the part about O-Ren's Origin, and the black and white scene is the Battle at the House of Blue Leaves. <br />My favorite scene is The Battle at the House of Blue Leaves, including the Gogo fight, the Crazy 88's, and the O-Ren fight. Gogo, the crazy 17-year-old, is definitely my favorite character, besides The Bride (who gets a name in the sequel, in case you were wondering).<br />Overall, this violent yet awesome movie is soooo totally cool. It is the best movie I've seen, but probably not the best Quentin Tarantino movie.
B000002LMM|4.0|If you're a fan of this show at all, owning this disc is a must. It'll bring you right back to the woods, and the diner. However, even someone unfamilar with the show would still greatly enjoy this soundtrack. It is simply beautiful music, mostly intrumentals, with a few tracks including vocals. The singing is done by &quot;Julee Cruise&quot;, who's own albums are very similar, and who's voice I can only describe as angelic. This is excellent mood music, and something great to listen to well &quot;Into The Night&quot;.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|Ben Stiller may be the flavour of the moment, but he is definitely over-rated in my opinion.  I finally saw &quot;Zoolander&quot;  after avoiding it for some time.  Granted, there were a few funny moments (eg. Merman) but this film is really aimed at people who have the lowest IQ.  Ben Stiller acts the same in all his films, so it was no surprise to me to find that he acted the same in Zoolander.  Same facial expressions etc etc.<br />I think I'll stick to films where actors work hard at their craft.
B00006AG5N|5.0|If it's not obvious, this is the absolute best collection of &quot;Elvis Presley&quot; ever, on one disc anyway. Sure it's missing as much is as here, but this is the best of the best. Everything from &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; and &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, to &quot;It's Now Or Never&quot; and &quot;Burning Love&quot; is included. Plus there's the cool remix of &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot;, that still gets stuck in my head on occasion. Nice booklet and packaging too. This is one album that you definitely won't &quot;Return To Sender&quot;. If you're looking for songs not included here, check out &quot;2nd To None&quot;, or &quot;The Top Ten Hits&quot;. &quot;Thankyouverymuch&quot;.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|Plain and simple: this CD RAWKS!  The playing is fast and loose, sloppy to make a point, free of studio gloss gimmicks, and is guaranteed to put a big smile on your face if you're of a certain age and remember a simple time when ALL THINGS ROCKED! Sure it's derivative, but that doesn't stop these tracks from being any less infectious - JOSH HOMME of QOSA can sure beat a mean tom-tom, too. At least they were their influences on their sleeves with no apologies - much more HONEST than the host of other &quot;emperor's new clothes&quot; wannabees out there too young to know about &quot;the next big thing&quot; the first time around! -
B00006WUWQ|4.0|Mike Myers, I thank you for this incredible collection set that's worth my money and everything else in it!<br />Alright folks, this is a collection set of Austin Powers that's not just worth buying for its worth owning!<br />Take a look at the individual specs for each movie. Then, take a look at the special features offered in each movie. And then, just do the math and what do you have? A movie collection that's worth all the laughs in the world that no matter how many times you watch it, you'll still keep on laughing.<br />So, shall we shag now or what? Don't make this collection wait, baby!
0156029065|5.0|The first book that made me truly love Eco's writing was The Name of the Rose, and Baudolino is a welcome return to the sense of mystery, myth, and adventure that I found in the former.  Baudolino's tale is funny, exciting, philosophical, and thought-provoking, and kept me interested from the beginning to the end.  His medieval Europe and the fantastical lands beyond are detailed and lush, at times realistic and at others beautifully surreal.  The issue of the unreliable narrator in this book is especially interesting as the theme becomes intertwined with that of false relics, false deaths, false loves, and false kingdoms.  Eco's style means a lot of descriptive detail that you may find yourself skimming over, and I think his novels can be difficult to get into for many people, but give Baudolino a chance for 100+ pages and I guarantee you will become as immersed as I did.  I read the second half of this book in one weekend, unable to put it down until I reached the end.  I didn't think that Eco could write a tale more capivating and fascinating than The Name of the Rose, but he's done it with Baudolino.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|To be honest, I'm usually not crazy about movies like this, but this is a total exception for me. It reminded me of Pirates of the Caribbean and Pearl Harbor to some extent, but otherwise is totally original.<br />There are a lot of little stories going on in the main story, which is pretty cool. There's the main story, about the rivalry of the two ships, the friendship story between the doctor and a young boy, and a few others that run on and off in the movie.<br />If you liked movies like Pirates of the Caribbean and Pearl Harbor, this movie is a 'must-watch'. Even if you didn't it's still worth watching. I wouldn't buy it before you have watched it, because it's one of those 'make-or-break' movies, but it's without a doubt worth a five dollar rental.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|Peter Weir directs this high seas adventure with skill and a great eye; the film received an Academy Award for cinematography, and the action and effects are terrific.  Russell Crowe stars as Lucky Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany is his friend and ship's surgeon as the ship battles a French phantom ship in this adaptation of Patrick O'Brian's series of books.  Some liberties are taken with the books, probably wisely; for instance, the protagonists battle the French during the Napoleonic wars rather than fighting the Americans in 1812.  Max Pirkis is excellent as a young seaman, and Billy Boyd does well in a small part as the crew fights for, and admires, their inspirational captain.  Sometimes the language is difficult to understand, so it helps to watch with the subtitles on.  There is some gore in the battle scenes and aftermath, but there is humor as well.  The film can be heard in English, French or Spanish, with optional English or Spanish subtitles.
1401300901|5.0|I found this book to be truly absorbing and looked foward to reading it each night.  It was an amazing story about love, family and truly finding oneself.  It examines love, lost, growth and the nature of the human spirit.  It proves that love is forever immortal.  This is a book that will open your heart and teaches the understanding of grief.  I have already reccommended this book to a few of my friends, and would highly reccommend it to everyone else.  I am highly anticipating her next novel.
B0001XWV0S|5.0|If you're going to buy this dvd, make sure you buy it for the laughs and you wont be dissapointed.  In the tradition of OldSchool, Eurotrip goes all out in a wild story of true friendship as a group of american teens help their friend find his true love.  Tour Europe with this crazy quartet as they go from one impossible misadventure to another.  Nudity, sex, and just plain wierd circumstance are bound to entertain you.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Kill Bill Vol.1 is a fantastic movie, if you like QT you will love this movie. The problem is this bland, almost featureless DVD. Miramax has already said that he's thrilled about being able to put out multiple versions of of this movie on DVD to make more money off the saps that buy the early versions. Rent this DVD and wait for the full thrills versions that will be out after Kill Bill Vol.2 makes it to DVD.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Wow, this movie sucks.  Ok, so Tarantino has a non-chronological, attempted mind-bending style.  But ~think~ people, what REALLY makes this so great?  Right; Nothing.  I'll stick with much better movies such as Fight Club (a true masterpiece...), Gladiator, Tears of the Sun, etc.  Even Pirates of the Caribbean makes this movie look lame. (ohmygod, did I just say that about a Disney movie???)
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I went to the theatre thinking this may be an okay film and came out totally enthused. This is well written, well directed, well shot, well acted, well scored, humourous, action packed, thoughtful, with fantastic effects that for the most part you don't even notice are effects (perhaps more a testament to how engrossed I was than anything else). <br />Seeing it again on DVD I have to concede it loses some of the big screen impact but what adventure doesn't?  <br />I could got into the plot in detail but why spoil things, you don't have long to wait for things to happen in any case. Rent / buy the movie sit down and let things take their own course. If you're at all squeamish then there are one or two points at which you may need to close your eyes, or perhaps your mind's eye as nothing is ever really too graphic it just seems that way because the director has led you to what is happening rather than presenting it in the modern 'in your face style'. If you like action it's there, if you like the majestic tall ships of old they are beautifully recreated. Russel Crowe is perfect as Captain Aubrey and wonderfully played off against Paul Bettany's ships doctor. <br />If you like older movies for their craft but appreciate more modern production values (particularly cgi guys who appreciate the value of keeping as many shots as possible anchored in reality by using real footage as the foundation) then this will delight you. The waves around the Horn are built upon footage shot there. Some of the sequences set on the Galapagos islands were filmed there. They had a real ship that they used at sea with a full-size recreation gimballed in the water tank and immaculately crafted large scale models all blended together seamlessly on celluloid. You've got to love it for the attention to detail if nothing else. <br />Watch. Be delighted. This is a keeper.<br />P.S. This is one of the most interesting extras disks I have seen - it really adds to your appreciation of the job done inproducing this film.
B0000524E5|5.0|This was pretty good. I only watched it because someone else recommended it. When I saw the trailers when it first came out, I thought it would be sleazy -- kinda like a cross between &quot;Cocktail&quot; and &quot;Showgirls&quot;. Turns out, it is not like that. Yes, it does take place in a bar where girls dance, but you do not see any flesh (at least not more than you see on the nightly news, but nothing bared). It is a good story about a girl fighting for her dreams against the odds, the ups and downs and it ends formulaicly happy, but that is what most of us want anyhow. A good date movie, a good family movie (teens), kinda mellow, good music.
B000000OAH|5.0|Queens &quot;Jazz&quot; seems to get over-looked somehow. Could the order of the songs have something to do with it? because i find very little to complain about. some of the reviews i'v read here are down right dumb. The hits &quot;fat bottomed girls/bicycle races&quot; and &quot;don't stop me now&quot; are queen at their best. other great songs include the ballads and among my favorites &quot;Dreamers ball&quot; and Jealosy and the hard hitters entertain you and dead on time. &quot;jazz&quot; is another great album from Queen. I think queen fans put this album down because it's not as strong as opera, or Queen2, sheer heart attack, but jazz is not far from their best. The one small complaint i have is the album should have ended with &quot;don't stop me now&quot; cos &quot;more of that jazz&quot; is the only weak track to be found. the rest of the album is a great listen.
B00006AUIG|5.0|I can forgive the guy who said that the Session 9 tape after which the film is title, was 'Ultimately, a Macguffin', because I assume that he thinks a Macguffin is something served at McDonalds with egg and bacon.. Quite obviously to anyone who experiences the film with their eyes and ears, the 'session 9' tape is the complete embodiment of the psycholoogical theme of the film. It's the recorded session where the personification of the patient's potential repressed capability for evil finally manifests - the trait of humanity that the voice describes as living in 'the weak and the wounded'. So there's  a huge and blindingly obvious parallel between the patient's final session, and Gordon - even to the extent that the final tape plays out as we begin to uncover the truth about him. And as for 'confusing sub-plots', what sub plots? Is someone really complaining about a subplot about a vagrant woman that was REMOVED in it's entirity from the film by the director because he felt it didn't work? Erm... what? Incidently, these scenes are available as extras along side a nice documentary and a superb commentary from some great filmmakers. The film expertly straddles the line between psychological and supernatural horror intermingling the two with creepy and disturbing expertese. It's superb, a great story that is brilliantly performed, and directed. If you're not afraid to engage your brain, give it a watch!
B00011CZRE|5.0|This movie is great but graphic.   The whole movie is very dark and has a sinister feel from the very begining.   Two cops find themselfs in the middle of a serial killers spree.   One cop (Morgan freeman) is just about to retire from the force the other (Brad Pitt) just joined from another dept.   They soon find out that the killer is killing as part of a sick and twisted plan and riddle that leaves the cops empty handed.   They quickly realize they don't have much time to capture the killer.   This movie will keep you guessing to the bitter end.   One of the best movies I have seen.   So turn the lights out, and some popcorn and enjoy!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|This was the most orginal and beautifully made film of all time in 1977. Nothing (with the exception of 2001: A Space Odyssey) had ever been made quite like it, and despite no DTS mix this DVD should be enough for any lonely, sci-fi geek who lives in his room.<br />Oh, and pretty please, with sugar on top, forget about the Greedo crap. Who really cares? This is still one of the greatest movies of all time. Don't bash it because of one little editing alteration.
B000066I6N|3.0|This is a review of Robert Plant's &quot;Dreamland&quot; CD, which I purchased after watching Plant's performance during the Nobel Peace Prize Concert.<br />A lot has already been said about the content of this CD and I am equally positive about it.  What has me bewildered is the recording quality - the entire CD is overly bright.  I mean, bright to the point of harshness that makes it painful to listen to.  I have to turn the treble down quite a bit and it still can't compensate for the brightness and excessive sibilance in Plant's vocals (without upsetting the tonal balance).<br />My audio system is reasonably high-end.  I have also tried this CD on two other music systems, with similar results.  I am tempted to pursue the matter with the recording company but hold no illusions that something will come of it.<br />A shame, really, given how much I like Plant's performance.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|I read the reviews of Clapton's newest effort and received both some enlightenment and some stomach cramps. Though not my favorite Clapton work, this CD is a passionate tribute to the memory of Robert Johnson.  Clapton tends to be defined by his more pop-oriented stuff, but, once again, EC shows he is much deeper and more gifted than that.<br />Clapton could have made another commercialy successful CD and gotten richer off of it, but he chose to pay tribute to his greatest influence.  He has said that he hadn't done it before because he didn't feel worthy.  Would an overrated Jeff Beck or Jimmy Page be more worthy?
6305907145|5.0|but I love period movies and decided to try this one. People who have read the book don't seem to support this movie but from my point of view it is perfect. The acting is so well done and every scene is beautiful in it's own way. The heartwarming story tugs at my heart and nearly every line of the well thought-out dialogue forwards the plot. Great replay value! Oh and may I add that the soundtrack is among the best I've ever heard. When I feel like watching Pride and Prejudice but don't have the 5 hours to spare, this movie scratches that itch pretty well.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I had never seen this film until I purchased the DVD. I had read quite a bit about it, and most of the stuff I had read was negative: critics didn't like it, it lost money when it was initially released, it didn't follow the original source works, ect... But to sit down and watch this thing is a real treat. The animation is beautiful and the art direction is stunning. I enjoy the Disney movies, but this one really stands out as far as I am concerned. I have never read the original works that the film was based on, but for my money, this picture feels cohesive and whole it's design and animation - which I feel plays a big part (subconsciously for most people) in the overall enjoyment of a film. Mary Blair's design influence is very strong and this film is a knockout!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I have two words to say about this DVD, and they are...SIMPLY INCREDIBLE! Forget any negative reveiw that is written here regarding this great package. Led Zeppelin still amaze me to this day, and I have been a fan for years. Zeppelin just blow any band(s) or musician(s) off the stage then, and most certainly now! If you are a huge fan of Zeppelins work, you NEED this set now! You will not be let down! If you are a new fan or a passive fan, go out and get this...trust me, you will be astonished!! If someone comes up to you and says that so and so are the greatest band or musician, you csn simply smile and say...ya right, Led Zeppelin is the greatest rock band of all time hands down!!
B00003CXCT|1.0|Ok, here's the deal.  Everyone has a different opinion of the Special Edition Trilogy.  I, for one, think it's absolute crap.<br />Each scene that has new or adulterated footage looks awful and sticks out like a sore thumb.  None of it blends with the campy low budget feel of the orginal footage.  Furthermore, the new scenes add nothing to the story, they just add pointless exposition and synthetic spectacle.  However, this is just my opinion, and I'm sure some people liked the Special Edition.  However I'm not going to buy it, and there are others on this site that seem to feel the same way.<br />People are saying that the Special Edition is the version of the films Lucas intended to make, and that since this is his trilogy, it's his decision, not ours.  I agree completely, I have no problem with him releasing the Special Edition version.  But by refusing to release the original trilogy on DVD, he is ignoring his fans.<br />People are saying that the originals are destroyed or in bad condition.  I'm not sure if any of these rumors are true, I doubt it, but I'd rather watch a gritty version of the originals than a crisp version of the Special Edition.<br />I hope this is what it looks like, a marketing ploy to get people to spend money on the less desirable Special Edition.  We'll see how principled Lucas is a few years from now when demand for the original version increases.
0671045857|3.0|I read Stephen King because Stephen King spins a wonderful yarn.  I don't think that this novel represents what the majority of Stephen King fans (like me!) expect when they buy one of his books.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if it had been a short story instead of a novella.  The material (plot) is too thin for the number of pages it fills....and the target audience seems to be smaller than that of the usual Stephen King novel.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|my perspective  - college music teacher, performer and director for the mouse.  Loved Les Mis, thought Aida was ok, think Rent is incredible, Phantom just so-so, have not seen Beauty or Lion King.<br />My wife and I just saw the show this past weekend and enjoyed it very very much.  Extremely clever story and simply an amazing cast.  We bought the album in the lobby right after the show.<br />Listen for the melodic quotes of &quot;somewhere over the rainbow&quot; in the overture - very clever and somewhat hidden.<br />The vocal performances are utterly brilliant and will lift you out of your seat (yes, even at home).  If I could describe the music - it is kind of : Rent meets Alanis Morrisette, meets the indigo girls with a few show tunes thrown in.  <br />A lot of the reviews on broadway haven't been too kind, but Wicked is a great show that will appeal to all levels.  It has mature themes(different is bad) that are handled delicately and make you think if you allow yourself to be pulled into the story.  A lot of people have a problem with the 'wicked green witch' smiling and singing about hope and a promising future, they must not notice children before we jade them with racism and politics.  <br />Am I easy - when I'm paying a 100 a pop for a seat, you bet.  Buy the soundtrack, see the show, you will not be sorry.<br />sidenote - the vocal writing is the best I have heard in any show ever written (and I am a total throwback - Bye Bye Birdie, Carousel, Oklahoma etc.)   The chorus sounds unbelievable and the voicings are perfect.  Yes, I wrote - perfect.  Clever and brilliant orchestrations, and performances that truly capture the joyfulness, as well as the ego - name - calling - popularity driven ideas of kids coming into their own.<br />Was this review over hype? Go see the show.  Remember how we all treated kids that were 'different,&quot; no matter how talented they were?  <br />You'll get it, and love it.
B00005JMX4|2.0|C,mon. im fed up of these Teen Comedies. always about 'Oh I cant wait to have sex, I will do it today'. BASICly this film is for Boys that have never been wid a girl in their lives. The actors friend in the film goes @have sex with her for me please@ wots dat all abot. PERVERTISM. But then again its kinda funny
B00013RC9I|5.0|This is one of the most hauntingly gorgeous albums I have ever heard.  And this isn't even mainstream music.  I don't know what to call it actually, except &quot;chill-out&quot;.  This is some of the most creative and moving music ever put down on compact disc.  You can sit down and think while you have it on in the headphones or you could just let it play as mood music while you're doing work or what not.  Highlights on this disc are every song on the album, but I really like &quot;Venus&quot; (very good), &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot; (the most melodically-pleasing song on the album), &quot;Mike Mills&quot; (the acoustic-meets-classical sound is brilliant), &quot;Surfing On A Rocket&quot; (really cool guitar on this one), and &quot;Alone in Kyoto&quot; (love the piano part at the end).  I like how the two French guys do their own vocals on the album, and along with the female vocalists... they actually sound pretty good!  I think they use a vocoder to distort their voices and it really works.  If I had to describe their style, it would be a downtempo Daft Punk-meets-Jamiroquai-meets Moby.  I don't know what else to say about this except that you're really missing out if you don't have this in your collection.  Support chill-out music!
B000002C1W|4.0|Dark Side and WYWH are very nearly perfect albums.  This album is not that good.  Piper is just a singular piece of work.  After those three, Momentary Lapse is easilly my favorite Floyd album.<br />Learning to Fly, One Slip, Yet Another Movie, On the Turning Away, and Sorrow are all great, great songs.  Signs of Life and Terminal Frost are solid songs.  Both parts of A New Machine are transition pieces, and not really songs.  They aren't great, but they aren't bad.  Dogs of War is the worst song on the album, but it hardly merits the hatred it gets.  It is just a mediocre song on a very good album.  Really, 5 great songs, 2 good songs, and 1 OK song makes a very good album.<br />As an aside, I have heard Roger Waters' 'Amused to Death' album, and I can honestly say that I don't think either post-Waters Floyd album would have been improved by his presence.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I'll be the first one to say that I never was the biggest Beatles, Rolling Stones, or Led Zeppelin fan, or any other bands in that vein, but now I've been turned onto by bands that carry on their sound in their music- The Strokes and The White Stripes to name a couple.  Jet is also one of those bands, and a bad one at that.  I love this kind of music.  It's just fun to listen to.  And Nic Cester's \\"yeah!\\" is one of the coolest interjections in music right now.  Of course I bought this album based on \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" (a fun fast-paced number), but also because of \\"Look What You've Done\\" (a pretty nice slow number).  I don't have any top 5 because they're all good, but I really like \\"Lazy Gun\\" and the little sound effect they do with the guitar.  Hardcore retro-rock fans (or snobs) may say that we don't need another band like this, but casual fans of retro-rock might find that this would be a nice addition to their collection.  I like it.
B000002UZ1|5.0|I'm not the hugest Beatles fan there is. Let's get that straight. I mean, I dig the Beatles more than your average joe, but still, I don't know all that much. <br />That aside, this is an excellent album. I don't have much money to purchase cd's so I mostly stick to compilations and best-of's so I can get a slew of songs from the whole career of the band(s). <br />This compilation of their latest hits is excellent. It has some of my favourites (With a little help, sgt. pepper, hey jude, back in the u.s.s.r., etc.) and then some. I bought the red album of earlier hits and am pleased with both, though I like this one better. You get 54 songs combined and while purists deny that 54 songs is enough the chronicle arguably the most innovative band of all time, this serves as an entry-level to Beatles listening. <br />My suggestion is buy this if you want to get into the Beatles. If you like 'em buy some of their albums. <br />My suggestion to diehard fans is not to buy this. Diehard fans probably already have every cd of the beatles already, so it serves really no purpose. <br />Overall, though, for what this cd is meant for it suceeds with flying colors.
B000002MUQ|5.0|Why all the criticism of this album?  If you are a VH fan of the Sammy years, then this album should be right up your alley with the rest of them.  This album is better overall than &quot;OU812&quot; and right in there with &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot;.<br />In this day and age, I give classic bands high marks that are able to keep their original sound while blending in the best of some contemporary elements--as opposed to totally selling out their sound or remaining exactly the same as they were 20 years ago.  While grunge was still plaguing the rock music scene when this album came out, the VH guys moved forward with an album that was both true to their sound and yet contained just the slightest hints of modern rock.  Take the guitar riffs on the first single &quot;Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)&quot;.  Clearly this song rocks, but it has that slightly modern rock tinge to it.  Don't let that mislead you if you haven't heard the track--it sounds good.  &quot;Can't Stop Lovin' You&quot; was the second single and a great power ballad.  I prefer this song to &quot;When It's Love&quot; off of OU812, although the latter was a much bigger hit.  While some will say this track has a &quot;been there, done that&quot; feel to it, to me it is an improvement on that type of track.<br />Onto other songs, many of which made it on to rock radio as a needed breath of fresh air in 1995....&quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; is an epic rocker with searing vocals and a catchy guitar riff to lead off the album.  &quot;Aftershock&quot; is a nice rocker later on the album.  &quot;Not Enough&quot; is one of the softest track VH has ever done, but it is heartfelt and nice with a strong keyboard backing that sounds more like piano than synthesizer.  &quot;Feelin'&quot; is an awesome epic of an anthem to close out the album...not that heavy but not soft either.  The instrumentals are all decent to excellent as well, as is the other ballad on the album &quot;Take Me Back&quot;--which is more guitar-based than keyboard-based and another heartfelt track.<br />That leaves my two least favorite tracks on the album.  &quot;Big Fat Money&quot; just isn't that musical, although it is rocking and whimsical.  Definitely a heavy track, just not as excellent as most VH songs.  And my least favorite track is &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, just because of the silly lyric and kind of annoying chorus (&quot;wam bam Amsterdam???&quot;).  At least it is still a reasonably rocking song.<br />I bought this album the month it came out in 1995, and I just had to revisit recently in light of the great (I think) news that Sammy is returning ti the VH fold.  For sure, it still sounds as good to me now as it did then.  Rock music fans seem to sour on bands' later efforts no matter what they put out.  In the case of such artists as Aerosmith, I understand the criticism.  But for these guys...please.  This album is right there in quality with the rest of them (except for VHIII, of course).  Definitely a must-own for me as a longtime VH fan.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|The music on this cd is excellent. It itself is 5 stars. Still I didn't like the way they included only &quot;no.1&quot; hits. I think it needed a bit more more depth to qualify, which is why is why I bought the red and blue albums (54 songs in total). Still for those seeking the feel-good days of the Beatles, this will do fine. Epecially if you don't like the white album. And just care about the pop hits. <br />Don't get me wrong, this stuff is excellent. It's so funny how EVERYONE knows the Beatles and knows at least a couple songs thety can sing. <br />Excellent liner notes.<br />And what the heck is up with the guy who dissed the Beatles. Hello, has he been living under a rock for the past 40 years? These guys are the greatest rock n' roll has to offer. Yeah, they weren't exactly naturals at singing or playing their instruments. But like Velvet Underground or REM, these guys were smart as hell and innovative. They broke so many barriers. Geez buddy, go back to your Nickelback or whatever garbage you listen to.<br />And for all you people complaining that the Beatles are old has-beens, I swear none of your bands/artists will be remembered as long as the Beatles have and will be. Yeah, 50 cent is god! Go Britney! Eminem you invented rap! Yeah just keep lying people. Artists these days are nothing but rich, lazy, sellout @$$holes who don't know Led zepppelin from the Dead kennedys. Just  shut up all right, cause if it weren't these guys and others,. your music wouldn't exist today. so shut up.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Before I throw in my two cents on this amazing album by the legendary Nirvana, I'd like to comment on Terri's stupid, self-righteous behavior. This girl needs to get off her high horse and quick! Who cares if you're Catholic? You think Catholicism is the ONLY religion that exists? It's also against the Catholic religion to send racist e-mail, but we already addressed that. (...) This girl is so sure of herself, that she thinks she knows what God has already decided for Cobain. Now if that ain't arrogant, self-righteous, and HYPOCRITICAL, I don't know what is. Regardless, Nirvana is the best band of our generation. Cobain is the poet of our time. We owe it to him to buy this album. We also owe it to ourselves.
B0002234LS|5.0|One of the best movies I ever saw. It has a great story behind it. Johnney Depp stars as a writer. He is overcoming a future divorce and is having trouble getting along with his wifes new boyfriend. <br />It has a very good ending. Its not what you would expect through the movie. I am going to buy this the first day it comes out. It has great acting, story, and ending.

B00014K5TQ|3.0|First of all I would like to say that I really enjoyed this movie.  My only gripe with it (and the reason only 3 stars) is the only characters we really get to know are Michael Alig and James St. James.  If we knew a little bit more about the other characters this would definetely be a 5-star movie.  The acting is incredible and I would recommend this movie.
B00000HYXB|5.0|When I first heard this album I thought it was a joke.  Fast forward five years later, I decided to give it other chance and this time my head was blown off my body.  This album is one of the best metal albums by one of the best metal bands on the planet.  I cannot put words into how much this album kicks ass, so I won't.
B00001ZULV|3.0|The notion that prog-rock Genesis would one day become a singles band, and wildely commercially successful at that, would have been unthinkable for fans of the band's first decade. But it did, and this complitation is to set the hits record straight. Or did it?<br />&quot;Turn It On Again: The Hits&quot; (18 tracks, 78 min.) concentrates rightfully on the singles-heavy albums &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; (all 5 of its singles are here: Land of Confusion, Tonight Tonight Tonight, In Too Deep, Throwing It All Away, title track) and &quot;We Can't Dance&quot; (4 of its singles are here: Hold On To My Heart, Jesus He Knows Me, No Son of Mine, title track). That takes up half of the CD. Other hits rightfully included here are Abacab, Mama, That's All, and Misunderstanding. Beware: some of the tracks come in a (heavily shortenend) radio-edit.<br />There are nevertheless a number of highly questionable tracks on here, and others missing. &quot;Congo&quot; was a 'hit', didn't you know? Me neither. &quot;The Carpet Crawlers 1999&quot; is a pointless remake of the 1974 classis (I guess any excuse to ask Peter Gabiel to join in, would do). Inexcusably missing from this &quot;hits&quot; compilation: Your Own Special Way (from &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;, and the first Genesis single ever to make the US charts), Paperlate (major UK hit), Counting Out Time (from &quot;Lamb Lies Down&quot;, and a decent hit in Europe), Man on the Corner (from &quot;Abacab&quot;), and It's Gonna Get Better (from &quot;Genesis&quot;, a double A single with Mama).<br />So a flawed compilation at best. The trouble could've been avoided with a 2 CD set (as Columbia does in the excellent &quot;Essential&quot; series), which would have allowed to include all the Peter Gabriel-era singles and essential tracks. Finally, with 18 years of hindsight, it amazes me how badly the &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;-era songs have aged. It sounded ok then, but now these songs just sound  bad, period.
B000062Y98|5.0|Like all the other reviewers, I too think this album is way over the top and is wicked sweet (slag for way cool).  I also didn't like this album at first, but damn it grew on me now I can't get enough of it.  With songs like &quot;punishment divine&quot; and the 14 minute song &quot;...and than there was silence,&quot; this album is one of the best.  I guess Blind Guardian does mess around when it comes to kickin' ass.  Raise the metal flag high my brothers of metal!
B000002WMH|5.0|Elvis is the singer who made rock'n'roll popular, although even in his early years he did not limit his music to that genre. This compilation containing (supposedly) every song that Elvis recorded during the fifties, plus alternate versions of some of them, shows just how good Elvis was at several different styles.<br />Here you get all his famous rockers including Heartbreak hotel, Don't be cruel, Blue suede shoes, Hound dog, Mystery train, Paralyzed, Party, All shook up, Jailhouse rock, Teddy bear and One night, together with great covers of Tutti fruiti, Shake rattle and roll and other classics. Of course, you also get his recording of That's alright Mama, the song that secured his recording contract.<br />Elvis also recorded a number of country songs, though not as many as he did later in his career. Sometimes (as with Blue moon of Kentucky), he re-interpreted them very differently from the originals, but most of his covers were more faithful, albeit adapted to his own style. I forgot to remember to forget, Old Shep, Have I told you lately that I love you, Your cheating heart and Fool such as I are among the country songs to be found here.<br />Elvis also recorded some brilliant pop ballads in the fifties. Love me tender is the most famous but there are plenty of others. Among the lesser known ones, I particularly like As long as I have you. Gospel music was important to Elvis and here you can find Peace in the valley, Take my hand precious lord, It is no secret and I believe. You also get the eight Christmas songs that Elvis recorded in the fifties including Blue Christmas and Santa bring my baby back.<br />This is the first of three boxed sets covering the music of Elvis. While the boxes for the sixties and seventies (which I reviewed a long time ago) are by no means complete, the music he recorded in the fits easily fits on five CD's. Indeed, there is enough room left for a long interview at the end of CD 4 (which I could have done without) and an entire CD of rarities.<br />This box illustrates just why Elvis was such a powerful influence on popular music in the fifties.f rarities.<br />This box illustrates just why Elvis was such a powerful influence on popular music in the fifties.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|While Off The Wall is my personal favorite from the man from Dirty Gary, this album truly reigns supreme as probably the album that BROKE ALL THE DOORS DOWN! I really don't like to go into an essay about this legendary album so I won't. I just say that for an album that brings out Vincent Price, Paul McCartney, Eddie Van Halen, and James Ingram in the same breath and has a mixture of rock, pop, dance, funk, hip-hop, R&amp;B and soul and different styles of edge and class, you'll be granted with a Grade-A masterpiece. This album is truly IT! Michael turned out the mutha sucka here! Nearly 60 million copies worldwide and still going strong, &quot;Thriller&quot; is a true MASTERPIECE!!! SHAMONE, YA'LL! HEE-HEE!
055357342X|3.0|Martin is a great storyteller, but no Tolkein.  I enjoyed this series, but the storylines tend to keep repeating themselves--namely: treachery, murder, killing, rape, sexual exploits, and torture.  The storyline keeps jumping from character to character, so you have to try and remember what the character was doing the last time you read about them (perhaps four or five chapters before).  Sometimes the storyline seems to drag until you just want to read the last chapter and see what finally happened.  And--heaven forbid you get too attached to any character or are looking for a hero or heroine in these books!  There are no \\"good guys\\" here and if there are, they don't last long! One thing that really turned me off about these books is Martin's graphic descriptions of murder, mutilation, torture, and especially the sexual exploits of characters (especially Tyrion and Danerys).  Martin uses so much crude language that sometimes these books seemed more \\"X\\" rated smut literature, than good fantasy.  Maybe he is trying to appeal to a more masculine audience--but from the standpoint of a female that enjoys Science fiction/fantasy books, I was repulsed by the vulgarity and crude graphic sexual explanations.  Don't get me wrong--every chapter does not contain this kind of text, but he does tend to have certain crude words that he uses like common adjectives over and over. He could take a lesson from Tolkein and learn that great fantasy doesn't necessarily mean that you have to have explicit sexual encounters, vulgarity, and extreme graphic violence to create a great fantasy novel.  I did really enjoy the basic storyline in these books and Martin kept me interested enough to finish the series.  Will I read \\"A Feast for Crows\\" when it comes out--probably yes, because I want to see what happens.  Don't get me wrong--Martin is a great storyteller.  Just be forewarned that some of the explicit and graphic content and vulgar language may turn some people off.  I would personally be very careful about who I recommended these books to.
B00005JM0B|2.0|First off, Edward Furlong (sp?) was a much better young John Connor.  Furlong is easily old enough to be cast as the older John Connor now...  Second, for future scenes, don't slap makup on the idiot they cast this time, re-use the same older John used in T2.  Aging a babyfaced actor doesn't work well.<br />Arnie and the new Terminatrix were good.  It was fun seeing Arnie doing a different Terminator and the lady playing the Terminatrix was quite good at her part.<br />However, the missing Linda Hamilton was lousy.  The different actor playing John was lousy.<br />It was obvious that James Cameron wasn't driving this movie...it was missing his dark, but ironic, flavor.  The ending was good, as far as the whole radio and 1960's military facility thing goes...<br />S. M. Stirling did a series of sequels to T2...much better writing and concepts.<br />this was a sad a sequel as Lethal Weapon 4.
B000002MG1|5.0|Not only is Automatic for the People my favorite R.E.M. album, it's one of my favorite albums ever made, period!  It is a powerful, emotional album with not one single weak song.  Man on the Moon, Ignoreland, Monty Got a Raw Deal, and The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite are absolutely terrific songs that still resonate even 12 years later in 2004.  When I get a sick and tired of the tripe put out nowadays, I pull out this album and just bathe in its unique sound and meaningful, humanistic themes and always find myself soothed.  Amazingly enough, even though I've heard the album countless times, I still pick up new meanings or new feelings to this day with each subsequent listen.
0385336810|4.0|Emma Corrigan is searching for a way to make her dreams come true, a great guy, a great job and real happiness.  She manages to  utterly destroy her chances for a promotion at her first opportunity.

What happens when all your personal secrets are no longer hidden away?  Does it change who you are, does it change who your friends are or does it open new opportunities...?  Kinsella is a witty,  disarming author who  wickedly enchants and  humorously captivates in a story of the search for happiness, love and acceptance.  This is a true joy to read!
B000002UW1|5.0|No, I am not going to bash R.E.M.  Far from it!  It's just that while I definitely would rank Automatic for the People as my favorite R.E.M. album, I constantly vacillate when it comes to number two.  In one review I said it was Out of Time; here I'm going to say it's Document, with Out of Time slipping to #3.  R.E.M. has put out several strong albums and it's really hard to be able to do a 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. ranking of the top several.  That's the problem with R.E.M.!<br />When you listen to Document, each song elicits a different reaction:  I'm calmed by Finest Worksong, I can't help but ruminate when I hear Welcome to the Occupation, I revel in It's the End of the World As We Know It (and I feel Fine), and I savor Oddfellows Local 151 as if it's fine wine.  This is a powerful album -- though not as emotionally as Automatic for the People is.  No, this one is powerful on more of an intellectual level, though it still has a definite emotional payoff.
B0001Z363W|5.0|Who cares what the title on the record is? It's a killer album. And to the reviewer who said Zakk should have warned fans before putting this record out: you must live under a rock if you really didn't know what Zakk was planning to do on this record.
B000002LOE|4.0|While a few long-time R.E.M. fans eschewed this album as an abrupt departure from the band's previous modus operandi, many non-fans embraced the band because of this album.  &quot;Out of Time&quot; brought in many fans, me included, because of the powerful song &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; and a few other very catchy songs that accompanied it on the album.  Though uneven (more on that in a bit), &quot;Out of Time&quot; overall is a great album and probably the band's second most emotionally powerful album (at times, anyway) behind only &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;.  <br />I have to disagree with the reviews that bash &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;; just because a song resonated with the masses doesn't detract from its artistic value.  And though &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; is mocked more than any other R.E.M. song except &quot;Stand&quot;, I like that the band was willing to experiment and do such a song.  R.E.M. has pumped out enough meaningful songs to be given license to do an occasional fluff piece. <br />I alluded earlier that I feel the album suffers from an unevenness; though most of the songs stand alone very well, as a whole the album feels like a hodgepodge of songs from different albums.  Some fast, some slow, some thoughtful, some fluff, some experimental sounds, some traditional.  It's akin to something a fan would burn as a CD today rather than a studio-produced, coherent whole.  Don't get me wrong, though; the songs that don't quite fit in are still good songs in their own right.<br />While not perfect, any serious R.E.M. fan has to have this seminal R.E.M. album in their collection.  It has terrific songs and marks the band's leap from relative obscurity to the beginning of the band's apogee.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is the best movie of the year.  It is full of magic, adventure, comedy, romance, love.  It's not only a movie to entertain, but to teach you something in life.  Ewan MacGregor's performance is excellent.  At present, I think he is the best actor and also the most handsome!  I will definitely buy this DVD and recommend it to all my friends!
B0001DI0FI|3.0|While the movie does have some great special effects and cinematography, it tends to be very confusing as to what ship you are watching, who got blown up, etc.  Toward the end of the movie there is so much action you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys easily.  It's also difficult to understand much of the dialogue due to the thick british accents.  There really isn't much of a story besides search out and destroy the enemy, so I left the movie not really caring if characters died (and some did) or if they survived.
031286504X|4.0|I picked this book up a couple of days ago and read all of &quot;I am Legend&quot; in one sitting yesterday.  To sum it up, one man is the lone survivor of a plague which causes people to turn into living vampires.  As the plague progresses, those vampires die but their bodies are still animated by the disease (yes... I said disease).  According to the story it is a bacteria that causes the condition.  This story is credited by several people as THE story that started the whole &quot;Survival Horror&quot; genre which has been seen in movies such as The Omega Man (based on I am Legend), Night of the Living Dead, and Resident Evil.  That is only half of the story.  The whole point of the story is that throughout history it was the vampire that was the &quot;boogey man&quot; in a world where Man was the dominant and more numerous species.  With the last sentance in the story Neville states that &quot;I am Legend&quot;.  He understands that HE has become the &quot;boogey man&quot; of the vampire society.  He is the one who creeps out in the day to slay the vampires in their beds while they sleep.<br />On the way in to work today I was thinking about this statement of role-reversal.  Given that this story was originally published in 1954 I was wondering what inspired Matheson to write this story.  Instead of taking it at face value I wondered if he was making a statement that following the bombing of Pearl Harbor (13 years before the book was published) we made the Japanese out to be our society's boogey man but in the end when we dropped the atom bombs if we ourselves (Americans) had not become the boogey man we all feared.  Then again, maybe I am reading too deep into the story.<br />I gave it 4 stars because most this story could have been acted out on stage by one person.  Neville hardly ever leaves his house and when he does Matheson really doesn't provide a lot of detail into the state of the world.  I'm sure it was intentional.  If Matheson had made this into a novel instead of a short story I'd have rated it a 5... I just felt like there was so much more that could have been done with the story.instead of a short story I'd have rated it a 5... I just felt like there was so much more that could have been done with the story.
B00009P1O0|5.0|I'll just amend my previous review of this and advise you to get the DVD audio version of this disc because the clarity and intimacy of the sound surpasses anything I have ever heard. Justifies the price of a DVD Audio player all by itself, it does.
B000001FS3|5.0|For me, The Joshua Tree is the best album of the 1980's. It had a notably long recording process, and saw the group travel to the Heartland of America for inspiration and for the memorable B&amp;W cover art. The inspiration they found was in the direction of spirited, uplifting and sometimes heartbreaking sentiments delivered with fervour. Every song on the 11-track album is memorable. I'll start with my all-time favourite U2 song: Where The Streets Have No Name. I love this song dearly - it is about casting off one's shackles to find a true freedom of the spirit. I believe this theme is extended to the second single I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, which is about the search for spiritual meaning and an affirmation of faith despite a questioning soul. Songwriting does not get any better than these two tunes. With Or Without You is a brooding song that starts slowly , then winds into a majestic chorus before fading to a wonderful instrumental coda. Again, it evokes a strong passion clearly stated with no filters. U2 never made music this direct again, spinning off into irony and camp during their glittery 1990's Lemon sojourn, but these 3 all-time classics will never be forgotten. One Tree Hill is a passionate song for a NZ friend of the band's who was lost in an auto accident. Running To Stand Still is sort of exploring similar territory to 1984's Bad , but has a different feel, while the bleak Exit is an undiluted cry from someone at the end of a very dark tunnel of despair. The gentle refrain of Mothers Of The Disappeared is also about the painful emotions of the bereaved, but offers solace in the face of tyranny. In God's Country is a more straightforward tune that may have referred to the USA itself, where many patriots believe themselves divinely blessed. And why not?!!! U2 found the wellsprings of the rock and soul traditions in God's Country on their 1987 concert tour, and their American experiences are documented of course in the Rattle And Hum  movie . This title comes from the incendiary track Bullet The Blue Sky, which is about the fear of the military and economic might of the USA in certain Central American regions. This became a dramatic concert favourite thereafter. Red Hill Mining Town is another track with a memorable, soaring vocal performance by Bono. The lightest touch on the album is in the tune Trip Through Your Wires. All in all, a richly emotional album with great music and inspiring lyrics. I have seen it written that the sound quality isn't the best. Not being an audiophile, I wouldn't know, but I really don't believe that matters much. All that matters is the music and the message. This is a 5-star masterpiece. Highly Recommended!
B00006BTCA|5.0|I don't like to write brief reviews. I usually like to get into how I first heard about the band or the history of the band, but I feel that the description of this album is best left to few words:<BR>It's amazing. It's fresh. It's the best rock album I've heard in years. Buy it. You won't regret it.
B000001F5F|4.0|Audio albums of live concerts are probably becoming a thing of the past with the advent of DVD, but twenty years ago in 1983-84, this 8-track set from a still-improving U2 at the peak of its early live prowess was a very big seller , particularly here in Australia , where it made #2 on the album sales chart in an impressive 18-month run. Unlike many live albums that just present live versions of recently-released cuts from the band-in-question's current LP that don't sound as good as the studio recordings (with crowd noise + echoes etc.), UABRS includes older cuts (Gloria, Party Girl and especially 11 O'Clock Tick Tock and The Electric Co. that may have been unfamiliar to newer fans. These songs sound great. Sunday Bloody Sunday is good, but there can never be a better version of this song live than the one from the Rattle And Hum movie, where an incensed Bono rants against the hate of the Enniskillen bombers in the intro. The video of UABRS resonates more stongly with me than the audio album, but overall it is a solid 4-star album . It is likely to still be available on Video/DVD too. Essential for any U2 fan.

0743454529|3.0|Okay Jodi, you're getting dry!  I have read all of Picoult's books, most of which have some sort of unique topic, a long lost love reunited, court room drama, various voices, and a twist of an ending.  They are fun, fast reads.  This one, had a super topic and tons of potential, but lost it on a few points.    1.  Too many voices.  No, I'm not dumb; I could follow the story.  However, while some of the voices used are valid, others feel forced and are hard to really care about.  Do we really need seven people telling the story?    2.  Flat or unlikeable characters.  I really didn't care too much about anyone in this book.    3.  Huge stretches!  (I'll leave it at that).    4.  The worst ending ever!  (No spoiler).  I usually like her twists.  I sort of predicted this one except that it came so late I began to doubt myself.  However, it came out of nowhere and was too abrupt.  Also, it was too simplistic.      So, in short, Jodi picked a great topic, and it was still interesting; however, she fell short in many areas this time.    UPDATE:  Okay, so I read this again when a teen summer reading group at my school read it.  I liked it better (four stars now).  The teenagers LOVED it.  So, maybe it's just better suited for younger readers.  :-)
B000148KK2|1.0|Much to my own surprise, Krall has managed to plumb new depths of tedious preciousness that will cure even the most resilient bouts of insomnia, and has managed to do it not just on the massacre of otherwise great songs, but through her new found collaboration with her self-absorbed mate.<BR>Make no mistake about it, this is crap of the most fetid odor. There are other white Canadians quite capable of acquitting themselves admirably in jazz context who must be ready to jump off the sky tower in TO every time the BC Chanteusse sells a unit. To compare her to Bill Evans is to insult two countries, plus an entire tradition (or two). Thank God no one has invoked Oscar Peterson in the same breath as this inspidly dull, my God how overbearingly boring, ivory tinkler.<BR>Where to begin to castigate this junk? Were I Chris Smither or Tom Waits, perhaps I'd sue for damages for her odious renditions of &quot;Love me like a Man&quot; (Think monotone Marie Osmond) and &quot;Temptation&quot; (pity Oscar Wilde is no longer with us, I think he'd opine on this cure). Krall continues her assault on Joni Mitchell with as life draining a cover of &quot;Black Crow&quot; as you'll ever hear. Krall must have ambitions to be a chartered accountant. And as painfully monotonous as these covers are, they positively radiate with passionate heat compared to her work with the collaborations with EC. Aul' Declan can't seem to get the focus on much of this stuff, like trying to draw a bead on a target after knocking down a bottle of quaaludes. &quot;Changed my Address&quot; seems to be about literally changing an address and the closing of a club Krall played in (who cares?), and succeeds at drawing no emotion from the listener about either scenario. &quot;Almost Blue&quot; is almost dead on arrival. &quot;Girl in the Other Room,&quot; well, may blessings rain down upon their love, but I'd just as soon brick both of them in until they get how to write and convey a song.<BR>In a career that inspires paint to dry at an excrutiatingly slow pace, Krall has reset the bar lower with this release. If you are a fan of this tripe, my heart bleeds for you.
B000001FDK|5.0|This CD is a lot of fun! I loved the music in the movie, and this CD has all of the songs on it! You will be dancing around your house all day. This type of music is so happy and up-beat you can't help it! Makes a great gift idea for any grease or oldies fan!
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|This is quite an album released by D12. They have grown lyrically and the beats are even better than their first album. Swift and Proof shine on this album with their lyrical content and flow. Favorites on this album are &quot;Get my Gun&quot;, D-12 World, and Loyalty. Go cop this album!!!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I loved all three of the LOTR soundtracks.  However, this stood out as being the most melodramatic and the best combination of the themes from the other two movies.  Excellent job, Howard Shore!!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|&quot;Scarface&quot; is without a doubt one of the best movies of the past 25 years for many reasons. As seen in this special edition DVD, it pushed the envelope to the point of tearing it wide open. &quot;Scarface&quot; doesn't just succeed because of shock value, though; It's actually a very enthralling story because of the plot and because of the character created by screenwriter Oliver Stone and brought to life by Al Pacino in one of the most memorable performances ever in a movie. Its supporting characters and also the fact that it was based loosely on actual events further the film and serve to make it more real and gripping. The violence, drug abuse, profanity, and glitzy Miami setting all complete the film by showing the insane world that Tony Montana has created for himself.<br />The plot basically shows the rise and fall of Tony Montana from coming to America on a &quot;Banana Boat&quot; to eventually getting gunned down in his mansion. Along the way, he lives the American dream by buying nice material possesions and getting a trophy wife who is more trouble than she's worth. Despite the serious subject matter of the film, there is plenty of levity in Pacino's performance and in his now famous one liners. &quot;Scarface&quot; proves to be a captivating and shocking journey through one man's vision of the American dream.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|Holy shiz, what can I say about this CD... well I didn't actually buy it, but I think I will(its that good). So here I am listening to nothing but white stripes for couple months straight then I turn on MTV2 and there it is, their music video of \\"Take me out\\". It looks kinda weird very artsy(the video) but they got a good sound... then about a minute into the song it hits, ohhh yeahhhhh PROGRESSIVE~~!!!~!!!@!@! everything I love about the whitestripes when they perform live. When the beat starts to go \\"dunk dunk dunk da dinga ding - dunk dunk dunk da dinga ding\\" OMG soooo goood. So then im like ok lets DL their album first song I listen to, \\"Matinee\\"..... I'm like WHAT!??! it has a very peter gun cool factor sound to it with distortion. Two words, OH YEAH!<br />After listening to the rest one thing comes to mind, these guys can do no wrong.. Let me tell you I started listening to Jet right, first when \\"are you gonna be my girl\\" came on the radio I was like \\"Fck this pop rock\\" then I heard it on the commercials and im like \\"fcking sell outs\\". Ahh but in the end they won after listening to \\"cold heart biatch\\".... fckers....<br />But Franz made me say \\"fck jet\\". Basiclly listen to them you'll thank me later.. well you'll think it..<br />This may not be the most analytical(anal:P) review but you can see the sincerity of it and thats what count! and no, im not 12.. you gotta turn those # around bizatch
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|D12 world is amazing.just released today i have listened to the entire thing. i own the previous d12 album and there is absolutely no comparison this cd is awesome. some of the songs are humorous but some are also very serious one of my favorites is ''How Come'' this song is sung about entirely by eminem and is really good and actually almost emotional i know you probly think i am lying i mean this is rap but i am serious this cd is 1000000 times better than Devils Night go buy it.there is only one bad part about this cd and that is the skits but that doesnt even matter no one cares about them
B00012QM8G|1.0|I too had a copy of this DVD and was annoyed at the flipping over of the disc. However if you get the UK release of SL you will find the film spread over two discs and each one has a picture disc on it. Plus it's PAL which offers better picture quality than NTSC.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|I'm one of the so called &quot;Youth Of Today&quot;, I'm 16 and I hate the talentless music that is brought out by just anyone. As weird as some people think it is I love music from the 70's and 80's, and if I had one wish it would be to go back to then, cos that is my idea of heaven. Those were the days when musicians had talent. So in future can some of you think before you go accusing all young people of listening to crap.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Beggar's Banquet is the first album of the Stones' classic four album run.  From the opening of Sympathy for the Devil to the great closer Salt of the Earth, this disc marks a band who found a sound and ran with it.  The album goes back to the blues and country roots that the Stones would build upon in each of their three subsequent classics.  A solid album which is enjoyable with every listen.  4.5 stars.
6305014140|5.0|Amazing...I won't try to defend this for anything other than an incredibly gruesome, hallucinatory hour-and-a-half animated massacre, but what it does, it does so well. No film will desensitize you to the violent death of your fellow man more effectively than Ninja Scroll.<br />It's 'about' a wandering killer named Jubei, who in the mood-setting first scene tosses a rice ball into the air, puts an end to the lives of two highway robbers, then catches the ball and continues eating it. What it's really about, though, is the cast of villains, the Seven Devils, who seem like some sort of Jungain archetype of everything a good villian could concievably be. I'd be ruining some of the movie's best moments by listing all of their powers here; there are certain scenes where one of them reveals him or herself in a moment of unmatched grandueur; some of the best, though, include a sadistic bisexual lord whose body generates electricity and who runs nearly invisible metal wires across the countryside to zap his enemies, and a ninja who can sink into the shadows as into pools of water, and control the bodies of women in an absolutley disgusting way.<br />This is giving the stereotypical anime fan just what he wants, and there's a fair helping of sexuality as well. The movie stops just short of being crass, though, and has that uniquely Japanese way of making even the most hideous things somehow beautiful. Hardcore anime fans will not have lived fully until they've seen this; others, though, could probably benefit from it as well, if only by understanding a good deal of what anime ultraviolence is all about.
B000002WYT|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best Dave Matthew Band Album.  It has some of their best songs and most inspired playing.  Many of the songs have become concert staples.  Catchy hits such as So Much To Say, Too Much, Tripping Billies and the moster hit Crash are interspersed with musical gems like Two Step, #41, Lie In Our Graves, and a personal favorite, Say Goodbye.  This is one of my desert island discs.  The double shot of #41 and Say Goodbye is my favorite moment on any DMB album.  It never ceases to affect me.  Not a bad song on the whole disc.
B000092T6M|2.0|It is a tragedy that kids today know more about &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; than Robin Hood. I am of the opinion that kids need to get back to these classic heroes. But not by watching this lousy movie. Go get the Howard Pyle or Roger Lancelyn Green retelling of the story. Or better still, read the original songs and poetry about the Merry Men of Sherwood. Or read some &quot;Green Arrow&quot; comics. Anything is better than this tired movie. I fell asleep several times rewatching this movie recently - and believe me, I really TRIED to like it - having been in a &quot;Robin Hood&quot; fever and all.<br />Mix in Kevin Costner's half-hearted, tired performance and American accent with Morgan Freeman's unnecessary Muslim advisor to the Merry Men(?!?) and Alan Rickman's cynical portrayal of the Sheriff and you get a movie that you wish was never made in the first place. And did I mention that Bryan Adams' themesong? On second thought, I'd better not...
B000056K04|4.0|Let me first say that this is a great album.  But like many long time Dave Matthews Band fans I was disappointed and left wanting after listening to it the first time.  It reflects a change in musical direction for the band, due to the influence of producer Glen Ballard.  For me, the appeal of previous Dave Matthews Albums, as well as their live shows, is that the songs are both a vehicle for the lyrics and a showcase for the band's great playing.  I have always enjoyed the insturmental interludes in so many of their songs, especially the extended solos of Leroi Moore.  I feel that the band is an afterthought on this disc, never rising to the spotlight, so to speak.  Now that I've gotten that out of the way, the album is a great rock album.  More along the lines of their singles from Under the Table and Crash, but a bit more complex and contemplative.  Once I accepted it wasn't what I was expecting, and the more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it.  Althought brief, the songs carry and emotional weight that last after the notes stop.
0671578855|4.0|A bit less action then the other books
B00000K0DT|3.0|Perhaps I am being too critical, but I found this flick to be a bit predictable.  How often does Kevin Spacey play a weak, stupid little pawn in someone else's game?  He's too loved, too big of a name, and I quickly figured out that he must have some plan up his sleeve.  Wise-cracking, clever Spacey would never be cast in the kind of roll that this movie would have its viewers believe.  Not a bad watch for a bit of unchallenging entertainment, though.  But it wasn't entertaining enough to make me want to watch it again or even to recommend it to my friends.  No hard feelings, all right?
0446310786|5.0|I was assigned to read this book in 10th grade &quot;American Literature&quot; class.  To my suprise it grabbed me to where I couldn't just read the assigned reading.  Book is much much better then the movie.  Part were a little confusing at that age, but easy to jump back in.<br />Would recommend to a reader of any age!
B00005JLH3|4.0|I don't know why I like this movie.  I usually don't like these teenage targeted movies, but I like this one.  Maybe I just like percussion.  I don't know.
0140177396|5.0|I was assigned this book to read in 10th grade &quot;American Literature&quot; class.  Suprisingly this book was enjoyable to read and had a few events that caught me off guard.  I loved this book and would recommend this to anyone of any age.
0393324818|4.0|Michael Lewis' book Moneyball  is in my opinion one of the best economically sound baseball books written. I thoroughly enjoyed what goes into being a GM in the league from drafting big name college stars such as Nick Swisher, finding inexpensive talent and making them stars like Scott Hatteberg and finally work down in the front office. Michael Lewis portrays Billy Beane (GM of the A's) so well you'd think \\"how aren't other teams doing what Billy does?\\"<BR>        After reading this book I feel Billy Beane should be considered a mastermind of baseball. The book explains how lower income teams folded by July  and looking for a plane ticket home in September. Whereas higher income teams looked forward to post-season play. Billy took the A's and one of the more lower income teams, defied all odds, and made them AL West champions.<BR>        This book amazes you with the understanding of statistics, how Billy managed his money, and best of all, his knack for \\"cheap\\" talent. A GREAT READ FOR ALL BASEBALL FANS.
B0000DZEE3|4.0|There is only one reason why I do not rate this DVD with 5 stars: I really like &quot;Could Have Lied&quot; and &quot;Soul to Squeeze&quot; and they are not in the DVD.  Other than that, this is an excellent DVD with great, great sound and amazing direction.  The venue is incredible and the songs sound awesome.  I went to a Chili Peppers' concert last year and watching this DVD made me feel as if I was there.  Very nice.  Highly recommended.
0393039765|5.0|I'm one of that group of people who, prior to seeing the movie, had never heard of either Chuck Palahnuik or \\"Fight Club\\".  However, after seeing the movie and being totally mesmerised by the whole concept, the book became a must read.<br />Chuck Palahnuik has created a very unusual novel.  Written in the first person but at times offering confusion as to who is the narrator of the tale, the book is a roller coaster of emotions.  Who is Tyler Durden?  Against what is he rebelling?  What on earth will be the outcome?<br />In many respects, \\"Fight Club\\" is a whole new genre.  It is chaotic.  It is anarchic.  In fact, the whole tale is more.  It is truly nihilistic.  Tyler Durden inhabits a bizarre underworld where the rules are just so different from every where else.  Fight club's first rule is that no one talks about fight club.  Its second rule is that no one talks about fight club.  Yet fight club keeps growing before evolving into acts of criminal intent where lives become of little value and social norms are rejected.<br />When reading this book, do not expect a macho punch up novel.  It is far more.  It is a trip through another world.  It is a tour de force.
B00005JL78|4.0|One of the things I've admired about Steven Spielberg is that he doesn't necessarily stick to the same genres that made him who he is today but when he returns to them he does so in a manner that is stylistically and creatively much different from his original attempts.  Obviously the improvements in technology make this much more possible, but Spielberg, for all the special effects in a film like Minority Report, manages to keep the characters at the forefront and everything else in a supporting position.<br />A lot has been said and written about this film so I won't rehash old news, but here's what I thought made it an enjoyable viewing experience.  First, it was completely believable.  Even though it's set 50 years in the future, there's nothing so incredible or far-fetched to force a viewer to disrupt his/her suspension of disbelief.  Enough familiar elements remain to think that this could be a logical future.  Second, the story, originally a creation of Philip K. Dick, is very well done because it takes a complex situation and turns it on a very simple premise - what happens when you arrest people for crimes not yet committed and then discover that you yourself are a suspect?  We've seen Cruise in this type of role before but now that he's getting a little older we're seeing him bring nuances to the role (i.e. the death of his character's son) that simply wouldn't work a few years ago.  Lastly, the numerous plot twists, including what turns out to be at least two false endings by my count, keep you on the edge of your seat.  Okay, it does drag the film's running time to well over the 2 hour mark, but it ties all the loose ends up very nicely and provides a satisfying ending.<br />If anyone recalls when Spielberg received the AFI Lifetime Award he mentioned that his directorial output was far less by a large margin from other recipients and he had to \\"get off his ass\\".  With Minority Report (AND Catch Me If You Can AND A.I.) it looks like he's off to a prettygood start.
B0000B1OGD|5.0|The Valley of Gwangi is not a good &quot;A&quot; grade movie. It's not even a good &quot;B&quot; grade movie. But it is a fantastic &quot;C&quot; grade movie (the cinematic province of directors such as Ed Wood). Come to it with the right expectations and you'll not be dissappointed in this tale of Cowboys battling Dinosaurs in a turn of the century Mexico crawling with Spanish, Flamenco playing Gypsies (How did the Gypsies get here? Originally the story was supposed to be located in Spain, and they survived the rewrites that relocated it to Mexico.) The film is also significant in that it forms part of special-effects wizard Ray Harryhousen's body of stop-motion animated features.
B00000DGUG|3.0|Alanis Morrissette's sophomore set is no JAGGED LITTLE PILL. The best song on this album is JOINING YOU. Alanis,in the aspect of titles,follows in Prince's footsteps with THANK U(you) and U R(you are),replacing words with single letters or numbers. Like JAGGED LITTLE PILL,some songs on this album were written by Alanis and producer Glen Ballard. Some of them were written solely by Alanis.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Continuing in the experimental direction PJ started to travel with Vitalogy, No Code certainly takes a bit of getting used to.  There's nothing here as immediate as the straightforward rock of Ten or Vs, or even the strange but catchy stuff that Vitalogy had to offer (such as Betterman or Corduroy), but patience and continued listenings eventually reveal that this album rivals anything else PJ has done.  The band really expands their sonic palette here with a collection of songs that covers so much ground, first impressions of the album make it seem uneven and somewhat scattered.  However, as you learn the song structures (all of which are not your simple verse, chorus, verse format), not only do you realize how great they are, but the album gains a strange cohesiveness not apparent immediately.  Starting with the moody &quot;Sometimes&quot;, then moving on to the hard rock of &quot;Hail Hail&quot;, PJ tries a little bit of everything, and most of the time they pull it off successfully.  Different influences are shown throughout the album, from the world beat of &quot;Who You Are&quot; and &quot;In My Tree&quot;, to the slow Neil Young-inspired raunch of &quot;Smile&quot;(where Jeff and Stone swap instruments), to the Lennon-esque &quot;Off He Goes&quot;, to the punk scorchers &quot;Habit&quot; and &quot;Lukin&quot;, to the bluesy &quot;Red Mosquito&quot;(great slide guitar solos by Mike).  Stone takes the mike on the appealingly strange rocker &quot;Mankind&quot; and the album ends with a beautiful lullaby &quot;Around the Bend&quot;.  &quot;Present Tense&quot; and &quot;I'm Open&quot; miss the mark a bit, but certainly not enough to ruin the album.  The fact is, despite the genre-jumping, this still has that great Pearl Jam sound, its just been expanded.  These are some of PJ's best songs, and all catch even more fire when played live.  If you have this album and you don't &quot;get it&quot; yet, keep trying, its worth the effort.  And if you are just buying No Code now, be patient.  It takes some work, but this will become an album you can't live without.
B000002W9Q|5.0|On August 14,1987,the movie DIRTY DANCING was theatrically released and became one of the year's best films. Some songs on this album were previously released. The first track,(I'VE HAD THE)TIME OF MY LIFE was a major hit,performed by the surviving Righteous Brother Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes. Warnes had a hit song in the 70's entitled RIGHT TIME OF THE NIGHT. TIME OF MY LIFE was later used in a hotel chain commercial and Medley and Warnes sued for the rights. BE MY BABY was a hit in '62 for the Ronettes. SHE'S LIKE THE WIND was another hit performed by the film's star PATRICK SWAYZE. Another original track that also became a hit was HUNGRY EYES,performed by Eric Carmen. Carmen had a hit in '75 entitled ALL BY MYSELF. He also co-wrote the &quot;Footloose&quot; love theme,ALMOST PARADISE. STAY was on hit parade in 1961 or '62,performed by Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs. YES sounds awesome and is suitable for aerobics classes. YOU DON'T OWN ME was a hit for Lesley Gore in '63 and on this album is covered by The Blow Monkeys,whose frontman is a George Michael soundalike. Bruce Channel recorded HEY BABY and was a hit in '62. OVERLOAD is a hard-rocker. LOVE IS STRANGE was recorded in the late 50's by Mickey &amp; Sylvia. WHERE ARE YOU TONIGHT? was recorded by the Doobie Brothers' former frontman Tom Johnston in the style of Huey Lewis &amp; The News(at the time of recording,the Doobie Brothers were disbanded and would later re-form with the original members including Johnston). IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT was a hit for the Five Satins in 1956. The sequel to this album,MORE DIRTY DANCING,would contain more oldies-but-goodies and original music.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I have never been a Smallville fan, and to tell the truth I have never watched a episode on TV before, (accept for the occastional flip through)and I have no idea why I decided to buy this DVD set, but I am really, really glad I did. It is by far one of the best shows I have ever seen on TV. I fell in love with characters after the first episode and now I am a HUGE fan of the show and I can't wait for the 2nd season to come out!!!
B00000K2UX|5.0|On this soundtrack album to what is Tom Cruise's third starring film and first blockbuster,is,on my CD copy,the original 10-track line-up. It begins with DANGER ZONE,Kenny Loggins' first megahit since 1984's FOOTLOOSE,from the soundtrack album of the same title. He also performs PLAYING WITH THE BOYS. Cheap Trick performs MIGHTY WINGS. Lovergirl Teena Marie performs LEAD ME ON which rocks hard. The love theme performed by Berlin is TAKE MY BREATH AWAY. HOT SUMMER NIGHTS,performed by Miami Sound Machine,sounds cool. Another love song,this one a powerful ballad,is HEAVEN IN YOUR EYES,performed by Loverboy. That would make an excellent title for a cotillion or prom. THROUGH THE FIRE was performed by the almost unknown Larry Greene. Marietta,another almost unknown artist,performs DESTINATION UNKNOWN,not to be confused with the song recorded by Missing Persons. The TOP GUN ANTHEM is an instrumental piece recorded by Harold Faltermeyer,who wrote music for the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; trilogy,and Steve Stevens.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice's album &quot;O&quot; is one of the most magical musical compositions I have ever heard.  His guitar playing is simple, powerful, mournful, and majestic.  The cello creates rich and beautiful atmospheres.  Damien's voice is intimate and lovely.  The woman singer's &quot;delicate&quot; voice on the album provides a precious backdrop for Rice's brilliant storytelling.<br />In &quot;The Blower's Daughter,&quot; Damien takes a risk that pays off in no small way, when he dares to write a refrain that is simply eight words repeated over and over again.<br />&quot;And so it is / the same old story / no love, no glory / no hero in her skies / I can't take my eyes off of you / I can't take my eyes off of you / I can't take my eyes off of you / I can't take my eyes off of you / I can't take my eyes off of you /I can't take my eyes off of you.&quot;<br />This song captures what it is to be in love, more closely than any song I have ever heard.  By allowing his music to be raw and vulnerable, Damien invites his listener onto a journey with him -- a journey which is in turns profound, bawdy, melancholic, and delightful.<br />Well done, my Eskimo friend!
B00005JMEW|5.0|According to Boston Globe pop critic Renee Graham, Miramax COO Rick Sands--referring to the &quot;Kill Bill&quot; franchise-- recently told the New York Times: &quot;Vol. 1 goes out, Vol. 2 goes out, then Vol. 1 Special Edition, Vol. 2 Special Edition, the two-pack, then the Tarantino collection as a boxed set for Christmas. ... It's called multiple bites at the apple.&quot; <br />Multiple bites at the apple? Give me a break. We deserve better than this as consumers, especially in times likes these, with our crap economy, rising unemployment and skyrocketing prices at the pump. Remember all of those editions of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;? And how they released &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; just recently, with plans for a 2-disc cumulative DVD later this year? How much did YOU pay just to ensure that you had the DVD with the most goodies? I know I've paid plenty, and now I'm done.<br />&quot;Kill Bill&quot; is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  I give it five stars--the art direction is exquisite, the anime scene is awesome, and Tarentino scores bravura performances from his leading ladies--but I'll wait until Miramax is done trying to exploit us before I buy it on DVD.
B00003CX8J|5.0|yeah, ok, this is more of a question than anything else. anyone who has this movie, in the scene where the senator is walking out of the water onto the beach, turn up the volume. after they show the guy dumping suntan lotion on his girlfriend or whoever, and RIGHT before they show two african americans,listen REALLY closely to a child's voice in the background. i have asked several friends to confirm this and they all agree. a little kid says &quot;is that a N*gg*r?&quot; please help me out if anyones got information on this. i love the movie so i dont wanna believe its what i heard
B0000CDLA7|4.0|this one's very good and has many heavier parts than their other cd's.the heavy parts are also technical as hell,though,so it doesn't sound like most the &quot;heavy&quot; crap on the radio-this is what&quot;nu-metal&quot; should've evolved into!it is a definate must-have for any dream theater fan,or probably the best cd for beginners along with &quot;awake&quot;.also,if you want somthing that's a total trip-and-a-half go to the dream theater website and order their live cover cd of metallica's master of puppets(yes,the WHOLE thing start to finish!).

B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarintino is a genious and Kill Bill is his masterpiece.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|What a great feel good movie from the people who produced Notting Hill and Bridget Jones.  The cast may not be so well known in the US but they are really good, Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth and Liam Neeson to name just a few.<br />Some of the scenarios are a little wierd like the couple of reserved tongue tied body doubles who spend all day in the nude together simulating sex and a single British Prime Minister (doesn't happen).  All together the film covers eight couples in the throws of finding love, which keeps the movie interesting and fresh paced.<br />The genius of the film is in the way the little agonies and ecstacies of love are portrayed, which is so real it takes you beyond any feeling of contrivance in the story lines.  You can see yourself and feel agonies of old come back to haunt you as this movie unfolds.  The missed chance, the verbal stumblng, blowing the main chance by doing too much or worse doing too little or nothing.  This is not the human condition type of great soul searing agony, in this movie everything you see happens every day in every country and at sometime in our lives to all of us.<br />Within the overall feel good factor there are some really good performances, Neesom dealing with the death of his wife and bonding with his step son in particular stands out in the memory. <br />The feel good comes from the fact that everyone, or nearly everyone gets their woman or man.  The same sadly can not be said for reality, but watching the movie you conveniently forget and feel great.
B000002UAU|5.0|Let's began by analyzing every song on the album.The intro song which shares the same title as the album, is a splendid introductory hard rock cut that sets the tone for the rest of the album. The flow into With a Little Help From My Friends is great, and you'll find that you can't get the tune out of your head. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds is the most revolutionary song of the year, and possibly of the decade. Getting Better is a timeless song to sing when you're down, while fixing a hole is a metaphorical song about mending a broken heart. She's Leaving Home is a touching song about a girl leaving the life she knows to pursue what she's always wanted, one of McCartney's best cuts. The incredible song, Being for the Benefit of Mr.Kite is one of the greatest songs on the album, written by the late great John Lennon. The next song on the album is by far the most experimental track, written by another late and great composer, George Harrison. Within You Without You is pure genius with it's indian sounds and genius lyrics. When I'm Sixty-Four does a great job of helping the mood and is Paul's best song. Lovely Rita is a nice little love song, pretty much the only one on the whole piece. <BR>Good Morning Good Morning is a lyrical improvisation written by Lennon and is by no means the poorest song on the LP but is pretty forgettable compared to the other masterpieces on the album. SPLHCB (reprise) is a great and revolutionary hard rock remix of the albums intro, thought up and re-written by Lennon. Here it comes. The last song on the album has been voted the best rock song ever, and it remains that to this day. A Day In The Life, written by Lennon on a piano with a newspaper in front of him, is the best song by the best band, and therefore is a musical masterpiece. The album voted 2nd best ever (behind Revolver) finishes with a bang bigger than Hiroshima. If you haven't already, click on the 'Add to Cart' button at the top of the page and get next day delivery.

B00018D44U|4.0|I wasn't particularly fond of Jone's grammy winning first album. I borrowed a copy of that CD from a friend but I never bought it after hearing it, not even after it had won a handfull of grammys.  <br />But this follow-up album, Feels Like Home, hits close to home to me. I heard the first single on radio and I thought, now that is one really great song. Sunrise was such a delightful song that I was willing to buy the entire album even if only Sunrise was the lone good track. But was I surprised when I heard the rest of the songs in the CD! <br />Among the songs that struck a chord in me are Toes, the  renamed Duke Ellington song, Don't Miss You At All, The Long Way Home, and What Am I To You but this is not to say that rest aren't good because they are well beyond good. They're great songs too. <br />The music in this album have a more upbeat feel than the first album. The lyrics are deeper, more profound, and they tell the story of life with its unique poetry that is almost obtrusive and recondite. <br />What can I say, I just really love this album!
B000148KK2|5.0|this is an awesome begining to what feels like an entirely new era in Diana Krall's career. This is not a major departure so hardcore kall fans need not be scared. Rather, this is a smooth transition with a mixture of covers and originals (penned by Krall and Costello) that feels like the most logical and natural transition a tue artist would make. Her choice of covers as always is impeccable. Her phrasing, piano chops, and musicality faultless. As always, the caring touch of co-producer Tommy LiPuma sets up a vibe for the musicianship to rise to the top, along with delivering the performances on recording in a sonic beauty rarely heard in thi millenium. this is an amazing demo disc for an amazing stereo - please don't waste your time listening to this record in compressed mp3 files - that would be a shame. <br />The most striking thing to me is the sincere depth of emotion that one can feel from Diana while giving this a serious listen. <br />awesome all the way around. kudos to krall, costello &amp; the stellar musicians performing this music.
B00006879E|4.0|Let me start by saying I think this is one of the best releases of 2002.  Didn't know it's been out that long, did you?  However, I can't give it 5 stars because of track four.  That's by far the weakest track on the disc and just a bad song.  I say this with authority, because every time I've seen them (six times), this is the song that makes the teenage girls (read:  musically DIS-inclined) scream the loudest.  For those of you that love M5, you owe it to yourself to pick up &quot;Apartment 635&quot; by Dag.  Dag was M5 before there was an M5.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|The music scene has been so stale for so many years - these guys are refreshingly talented and the lead singer sounds like Thome Yorke and Jeff Buckley had a love child.
B000089RVX|1.0|I can't state it any clearer than Forest Law's review.  Evanescence is awful.  They're a corporate band on a corporate label run by corporate greed.  Funny how the stories of Amy Lee being Christian were swept under the rug as soon as that first awful song hit the top of the chart, huh?  She's a fake, but a well-coached one.  The entire Wind-Up label is a joke.  It should be called Flash-in-the-Pan Music.  My advice to Evanescence:  INVEST WISELY.  My advice to those of you who are thinking of buying this:  go to the used CD store.  There are thousands of them there.  Right next to Nickelback and 3 Doors Down and Creed and Good Charlotte and the rest of the rock radio crap that's currently riding this wave of teen idolization.  Wake me up in 2006.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|I ANALYZED THE WHOLE CD BEFORE I DECIDED TO GET UPSET AND THOUGHT I HAD JUST WASTED MY MONEY, BUT WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DID WITH THE FIRST DISC WAS REMASTER THE ORIGINAL ILLMATIC TRACKS SO THAT IT WOULD HAVE A BETTER SOUND QUALITY, AND U CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE. IT SOUNDS A LIL BIT LOUDER AND NOT SHARP, BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL DID SOUND A BIT DULL, BUT IT WAS STILL FIRE. NOW FOR THE SECOND DISC, IT WAS NEARLY FLAWLESS, BUT THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT IT WAS THE &quot;ONE LOVE&quot; REMIX. EDITED WHY?
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|D12 returns with an impresive second album featuring production by Kanye West, TrackBoyz, Red Spyda, HiTek, Mr.Porter, Dre and of course Eminem. Also Two new Catz Night &amp; Day, and Witt &amp; Pep. This Album is ment for one purpose to show off the rest of D12 and that they could hang without Eminem. D12 WORlD is nothing like Devils Night because Throughtout The album Eminem Plays the backround like Chad of the Neptunes. He Has a couple of Hot verses and some tight hooks but he mostly supplies the beatz. With only Two Guest Appearances Obie Trice &amp; B-Real[Cypress Hill]and a verse by Bugz one of the original D12 members[Sick]D12 basically carries all 21 Trackz of the cd. The Whole cd has Krazy Production But somtimes the Lyricz and delievery Are Lacking. But Overall the boyz of D12 have the potential to Make grimey Gangsta Rap all they need is Better track placement and some more conscience Lyricz. But Hey It's D12 and they're in a class of their own so It's off the hook.<br />    $. Trackz To Check .$<BR>1. Loyalty<BR>2. How Come<BR>3. Leave Dat Boy Alone<BR>4. Get my Gun<BR>5. American Psycho 2<BR>6. Bugz Freestyle<BR>7. 40 oz<BR>8. D12 World<BR>9. And of course My Band
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is an awesome cd!  I usually hate any kind of rap and hip hop but lp combines it w/ the perfect amount of metal and rock!  It rocks. anyone who says it sux is just jealous and I would like to see them do better than lp does! they just couldn't.  Other songs cant even come close to songs like numb and some of the other songs on it!
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|I have to say, I own everything put out thus far from the Shady / Aftermath record label and this CD is no exception.  It came out today and I immediately went to get it.<br />If you are a big D-12 fan, this CD is quite a bit different than Devil's Night.  Their first CD is a classic... every track is good.  On this CD, though, only about half the tracks are good... it almost appears that they are trying to tone things down a little bit.<br />If I could have put 3.5 stars I would have.  This CD just doesn't compare to Obie's Cheers or D-12's Devil's Night.
6301174240|5.0|I wasn't even 1 when this came out and now that MJ is out of style everyone thinks I'm crazy but I'm not, I know a good thing when I see it. At the beginning I think there's a lot of stuff for his ego but the way it is arranged is brilliant. The actual movie part of it is great with brilliant acting and dancing from all cast members, by the time it gets to the end of the actual movie its ruined by what a child would marvel at, gone just a little too far but the special effects used to create this was genious. As a whole the video is one of my favourites and I give it a full  rating. Any Michael Jackson fan should be proud to own this!
0385336810|5.0|Better than I expected!  Right up there w/ the shopaholic series.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|AND SHE IS ENTITILED TO THAT. ... I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED HER SOULFUL VOCALS AND ON THIS CD I AM REALLY DIGGING THE  ECCENTRIC BENT HEARD THROUGH EACH TUNE. IT IS EARTHY REALLY, SENSUAL, AND EARGASISM TO SAY THE LEAST. THIS ARTIST AND LATEST CD IS WHY I CONTINUE TO LOVE LOVE, MUSIC..
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|This Cd is really good. A little better than Devils Night. Some songs they could of left out like Bizzares song JUST LIKE DADDY, and D-12 WORLD. I personally think that they should either teach Bizzare how to rap or take him off the album and out of D-12. (...) But other than that this Cd is definatly worth buying. Some of the best songs are 40 OZ, HOW COME, TRUE LOYALTY,GIT UP, SIX IN THE MORNING,GOOD DIE YOUNG, and AMERICAN PHSYCO 2. Buy this Cd but f**k Bizzare.
B00005JMFI|5.0|I went into this movie with an open mind, I came out with a new favorite movie. I laughed till I cried. This is the first time I have actively tried to find out when I can buy a movie. I loved it. I can't wait to see it again. <br />Will Ferrell does an outstanding job. He is perfect for the role. His sincerity is perfect. No one else could have pulled off this role as well as he did. He answers the phone with \\"What's your favorite color?\\" Just thinking about how he did it still makes me laugh all these months later.<br />Great movie for anyone who still has their inner kid alive and kicking. And it might even be wake up call for a few who thought their inner kid was long gone.
B000002J0B|5.0|Wow what a unbelievable CD. I had nvr heard Led Zep until about a month ago.....and am now obsessed....because of this CD.The first three songs are accoustic and are great...proving what a awesome guitar player Jimmy Page is, The Crunge is great...with amazing singing from Robert Plant...D'Yer Mak'er is a great song...I listened to this song over and over again at first..wonderful....Then, No Quarter....well at first I listened to it up to where Plant starts singing..and changed it immidiatly...well...i would say to any1 like me who hadnt really known Led Zeppelin...my advice is...stick with it...its a wonderful song....John Paul Jones is great on the piano and synthesizer....and although it took some getting used to im a huge fan of this song now...The Ocean....is amazing....great singing from Plant...great music from the rest of the band....one of the few cd's where I love every song.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|This CD is amazing. D12 are amazing. So go buy this, its better then Devils Night.
0393324818|4.0|Being a pretty solid baseball follower is what primarily drew me to the book, and in the end made me enjoy it thoroughly.  Not to be discouraged though, all of you non-basesball fans.  Even if you do not follow the sport, the story of Billy Beane (a former major league player who built up a losing team using second hand players) creates an interesting behind-the-scenes look at baseball as a business.  Also, although it makes references to baseball, it is easy to draw comparisons to the everyday world.<BR>      The only parts that I drew away from, or made me lose my attention were those that focused a lot on budget, money, and statistics.<BR>     Besides these every-so-often sections, though, I definitely recommend this book to anyone, baseball fan or not.
B00009P1O0|5.0|Let me try to write a few notes on the album:<BR>1) the album contains some of the greatest songs NY ever wrote, in particular &quot;On the beach&quot;, &quot;Revolution blues&quot; and &quot;Ambulance blues&quot;. These songs are just Neil Young at its best<BR>2) this is not similar at all to Harvest or Rust Never Sleeps, this was written during a very bad period in which Neil was haunted by several demons (a friend had died, he had split form his wife, he was really too popular, and I think he was drinking far too much...)<BR>3)the album was never released in CD until this year, this was a crime by Neil Young, who probably hated the record (or loved it too much). However some clever guy made a site on the internet with a petition by fans to release the record, I think he got a few thousand signatures on the petition (included mine) and probably Neil found out about it (at least I like to think this was the reason)<BR>4)the record is interesting because it's not similar to anything else by Neil, in general the songs are a bit bluesy, with some ballads like &quot;see the sky about to rain&quot;, &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; and &quot;for the turnstiles&quot; who are more acoustic, and some very slow blues songs like &quot;On the beach&quot; and &quot;Vampire blues&quot;. There is also a blues-rock piece, called &quot;Revolution Blues&quot;, which is one of the best of the album, very aggressive both in lyrics and music<BR>5) I rate it 5 stars because it's probably his darkest and more peculiar record, and to me his best, however if you never listened to NY you should start with Everybody Knows This is Nowhere or Rust Never Sleeps, or Zuma, this is a bit too difficult for beginners<BR>6)Let's hope Neil keeps on rocking forever, and maybe he will give us another jewel like this.....
B0000524EM|5.0|THE CROW movies are my favorite action movies of all time.  They are each well acted, well directed, well written, and are all beautiful in their own ways.<br />THE CROW is one of my favorite films of all time.  It has great performances by Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson, Michael Wincott, and Rochelle Davis.  Alex Proyas was a great director for this film, showing the present in either a dark way or with lots of red with the sad flashback scenes very colorful.  When there is no talking, the film is still highly interesting with the fun action scenes, the great music, and the exciting, gloomy visuals.  I give this a 5 out of 5!<BR>RIP Brandon Lee!<br />THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS is very underrated.  People put it down because they compare it to the original, but it's really a completely different story with the same concept.  This one has great performances by Vincent Perez, Mia Kirshner, and Richard Brooks (and an ok performance by Iggy Pop).  This time, the director (Tim Pope) shows a post-apocalyptic/S&amp;M-like Los Angelus and the colors are yellow, green, red, and blue.  The main villain is not as cool as in the original and his death is kind of silly but that is the only negative thing I can say about this beautiful, dark and haunting sequel.  I give it a 4 out of 5.<br />THE CROW: SALVATION is another great story to add to THE CROW legacy!  Starring great actors like Eric Mabius, Kirsten Dunst, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe, William Atherton, and Fred Ward, and a tone more close to the original, this one is probably better then number 2.  Eric Mabius plays a better Crow then Perez (but no one will beat Brandon Lee), and Kirsten Dunst is great as the heroine who helps him.  This one also adds something fresh:  a murder mystery.  Alex is searching for the killer (or killers) who butchered his girlfriend and framed him for the murder.  The only bad thing I can say about this is that the villains (especially the main one) were one-dimensional losers.  I give this a 4.5/5.<br />Overall, this is a great series.  I can't wait for THE CROW: WICKED PRAYER starring Edward Furlong as The Crow and David Boreanaz as the villain.  Overall, I give this series and boxset a 5 out of 5!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|&quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, the second album from A Perfect Circle which features Tool singer Maynard James Keenan and former Marilyn Manson bassist Twiggy Ramirez, improves on the debut &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; in virtually every aspect.  The band sounds tighter than before, and as hard as it is to believe even more melodic than before.  Keenan's voice has more power and range here than on the previous album, and he sounds more at home here than ever before.  Standout tracks include the hit single &quot;Weak &amp; Powerless&quot;, the excellent &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;A Stranger&quot;, &quot;Pet&quot;, and &quot;Lullaby&quot;; all of which are excellent tracks.  All in all, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; is undoubtadly one of the best albums of any genre to be released in 2003, and if you've never checked out A Perfect Circle before, now is the time to do it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have the misfortune of not having had the privilege of seeing this on the T.v and only brought it on the off chance,have to say it was brilliant.Great as a westen and even better that it was scifi to, a must buy item.<br />Come on that can't be the end of it, some one please put me out of my misery and tell me there's more in the pipeline somewhere.
B000059Z8M|5.0|Excellent movie. Both my 3 year old daughter & myself sit down together & watch this movie on a regular basis. We both love this movie - she adores the characters and I love the humourous storyline & quality animation. Not a dull moment from beginning to end.
B000002H97|5.0|This is a great heavy metal album. It is not thrash metal like their previous 4,it's not fast enough.But I still love it. I like the lyrics. Some prefer James' older lyrics but I like 'em all.To me this album is HEAVY and I also listen to pantera,slayer, sepultura, and canibal corpse. My favorite songs are The Struggle Within, Sad but True,WIMR,and Don't Tread......<br />And even though this album has a different sound than their previous onne's, the solo's still kick @$$.
B0001I55SS|5.0|Okay, people, let us please understand something.  The Black Hole started production before Star Wars was released.  It was not a Star Wars rip off or something that was rushed out to capitalize on the Lucas craze.  It's a completely different film.  It has lots of problems, obviously, but you know what?  It's *still* better than the Star Wars films.  I'll let you figure out why.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|If you like the song played when the Bride finally enters Bill's house, it's called &quot;Summertime Killer ( Ricatto Alla Malla)&quot; by Luis Bacalov, and it's on the album &quot;Beretta 70: Roaring Themes From Thrilling Italian Police Films 1971-80&quot;
B000005K23|5.0|Since 1983, I have a Marillion phase that last 3 months every year.  I have started with this phase with the song &quot;He knows you know&quot; played over and over on cassette until the tape gets jam in the machine.  In 1990, I came back from an exhibition in USA where I had bought a hi-fi demo cd player for the 1/10 of the price.  Ran to the store and bought &quot;Script for a jester's tear&quot; and &quot;Misplaced childhood&quot; cd's.  My boyfriend was really mad at me, first because he did not choose the cd player and second because he had nothing else than Marillion to listen.  The day after, he was really happy about the machine but not the cd's.<br />As he says, &quot;Script for a jester's tear&quot; sounds depressing. Somebody else told me my music was morbid (I guess the church organ sound disturb most).<br />Couple of years later, my favorite song is no more &quot;He knows you know&quot; but &quot;Script of a jester's tear&quot; (Fish voice is nice on this song).  Second favorite is &quot;The web&quot;(I find the guitar solo is so nicely done in it).  &quot;Forgotten sons&quot; is another great song (very mood and instrument changing).  The average song on this album is &quot;Chelsea monday&quot; and the most depressing one with fake like church organ sound.<br />No matter what they say, I just like it.
B0001IN07Q|1.0|I just brought home my first Michael Buble CD and I must say I was thoroughly underwhelmed. What's all the fuss about this guy? His vocal talents are pleasing but by no means extraordinary. As a jazz buff, I appreciate his reverent handling of these classic songs, but there is nothing groundbreaking here. To paraphrase a rather coarse political campaign manager &quot;IT'S THE MATERIAL, STUPID!!!&quot; People respond favorably to this music because IT'S GREAT MUSIC, not because Buble has such a wonderful voice. I have to assume that most of those tossing bouquets at his feet aren't familiar with the great American songbook. When I heard his &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; I wasn't moved to tears. I moved over to the CD case to get out my Sarah Vaughn and Chet Baker CD's. Keep in mind that these songs have stood the test of time, (Hum, maybe that's why they are referred to as classics?!) and have been covered by countless singers over the years, many of whom possessed vocal instruments far superior to young Mr. Buble. <br />This does bring me to one possible bright spot-- Michael Buble is quite young. Maybe his voice will mature. Maybe he'll want to expand his range and try more challenging material. Maybe he'll reinvent those standards and put a totally fresh stamp (preferably his) on them. Or maybe he'll continue sleepwalking through the Frank Sinatra greatest hits catalogue and raking in bucketfuls of money while he can. If he takes one path we'll be discussing him 30 years from now.  The other path leads to a VH-1 &quot;Where Are They Now&quot; episode. Time will tell.<br />To the extent that the current Buble-mania introduces this songbook to a new audience, it's certainly a positive movement on the music scene. Hopefully some of his fans will want to go further and will investigate other great singers past and present. Personally, I'm going to continue listening to the vocalists he cites as having influenced him.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I have two complaints to do on this album.  First, I find it too long (18 songs total, that's a lot).  Second, on &quot;Everloving&quot; song, for 3 seconds in the begining the sound comes only from one ear (very disturbing for me).<br />Moby is brilliant at mixing things together.  My favorite songs in order are &quot;Natural blues&quot;, &quot;Everloving&quot;, &quot;Why does my heart feel so bad?&quot;, &quot;If things were perfect&quot;, &quot;South side&quot;, &quot;Body rock&quot;, &quot;Honey and &quot;Machete&quot;.  Sorry but I am tired to hear porcelain.  There rest is fine except for &quot;Rushing&quot; and &quot;Down slow&quot; which I don't like.<br />Too bad my favorite song &quot;That is when I reach for my revolver&quot; is not on this album.
B00005BL2A|1.0|I can't stand listening to this cd.  Think of the potential, and they released this.  If they don't want to make &quot;innovative&quot; material anymore or use synths, I say quit!  Leave the legacy intact!

B000084T18|1.0|Listening and buying this cd is the equivalent of sending blank checks around and stating to the receiver -- you can write any amount on the check I don't care.  (...)  Same as this **** cd.  Listeners stop buying this crap.  Its intelligence is below zero!
B0001US8EO|5.0|This movie is a defintive western.  No doubt about it. The look of it makes the cartoony Tombstone pale by comparison.  Not only that, but the cover art (which was the movie poster) is one of the most beautiful pieces of wild west art I have ever seen. I own the poster for that reason.<br />Many did not like this movie, as it came out 6 months after the more flambouyant Tombstone.  But this one is the real deal.  It is painstakingly historically accurate and has a keen attention to detail.<br />I loved this movie from the first time I saw it, and own the directors cut VHS (let's hope this release is that cut as well).<br />It is an acquired taste for sure, but do give it a chance.  Some fine acting all around for an amazing cast that includes: Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, Mark Harmon, Gene Hackman, (a young pre-Jesus) Jim Caviesel and Tia Leon -- many in early roles before bigger careers. Hackman as Earp father is as always amazing.  And Dennis Quad's Doc Holliday shines. Costner gives a wholly unlovable portrayl as Wyatt (which may have turned some off -- not liking the main character is not always good for films), but he gives us a deeply layered man with a haunting past and a lot of guilt.  <br />Kasdan as director gives his best here, and you can tell he loves the genre.<br />The real pity here is that this isn't the directors cut like the VHS I have.  I would rather have that on DVD rather than the extra scenes taken out of the context of the movie.  If only there was a way to play the movie with or without those scenes like the choice of the ABYSS DVD of the theatrical release and the fuller directors release. Oh well
0312995423|1.0|Having read and enjoyed the 'DaVinci Code' I was looking forward to another book by this author.  What I found with Digital Fortress was a painfull read full of simplistic plot holes and glaring technical errors.  The ending was so bad I felt I had really wasted my time with this book.
0679805273|5.0|I read this book to my children so many times, and they loved the inspiration, as well as learning about challenges, that CAN be overcome. The book has great illustrations, and is a great read, while it teaches valuable life lessons.<br />Preparing our children to persevere, discover their dreams, and to keep going even if times get tough is what this book is all about.<br />Highly recommended to help children learn that they CAN make their own dreams come true. An Inspiring and Enjoyable Read!
0385510438|2.0|I must admit that I fell asleep often while reading this book... which is rare because John Grisham usually keeps me up all night with his usual page turners.  I thought this would be a come back after &quot;Bleachers&quot;, which bored me to tears, but I was sadly mistaken.  Can we please see more of the old &quot;John Grisham&quot; next time?
0920668364|5.0|I read this book so many times to my children when they were small, they loved it each time, as it showed them the stages of life in a poignant and beautiful manner. I never cried from this book, and neither did my children, although I did get choked up, with moist eyes. It also brought about more of a loving bond, that shows the circle of life, and how important unconditional love is between a parent and child.<br />I highly recommend reading this book to a your child. It will show how much love there is, and how it endures \\"forever.\\"
B00005JLT5|4.0|When I finished watching this movie I was pretty much speechless.  This is a movie that, I think, everyone should see.  In some ways, it's similar to Schindler's List but The Pianist follows one person as opposed to a large segment of people.  At times, it's a difficult movie to watch because of the atrocities that occured.  I found myself comparing The Pianist to Schindler's List quite a bit.  In the end though, I prefer The Pianist because it seemed more real.  It must have been awful to feel so alone in the world after being split up from your family and not knowing what will happen to you or them.<br />The movie is about a man, Wladyslaw Szpilman who, in the 1930s, was known as the most accomplished piano player in all of Poland.  At the outbreak of the Second World War, Szpilman becomes subject to the anti-Jewish laws imposed by the Germans. By the start of the 1940s, Szpilman sees his world go from piano concert halls to the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw and then must suffer the tragedy of his family deported to a death camp, while Szpilman is conscripted into a forced German Labor Compound. At last deciding to escape, Szpilman goes into hiding as a Jewish refugee where he is witness to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Warsaw City Revolt in 1945.  This is truly a movie that must be seen.

B0000640VO|5.0|No plot summaries here. Nor cast lists, nor complaints about the lack of extras. The better the film, the less I want to know about &quot;The Making Of...&quot; since it'll have likely been trotted out a million times already as a cheap TV schedule filler anyway.<br />Instead, I want to drone on at length about what I call a proper film. Few things are as pleasing as something executed with genuine flair. Something that makes you feel like you've seen something worthwhile; and yes, proud that there are people out there who can produce things like this. (If possible, have Elgar's &quot;Nimrod&quot; playing in the background as you read that bit.)<br />Does it pass The Test? <br />&quot;Is it as good as Joan Cusack?&quot; <br />Yes. Nearly. There can be no higher accolade.

(I could be wrong) 50 isn't the best MC alive I would say it is Nas, Eminem, Common, Snoop Dogg, or Rakim or someone in that nature. 50 cent album would bearly get a four or just a three. but i'll be nice this time. g g g g g g G UNIT!!
0671027387|5.0|Dan Brown has clearly done a lot of research prior to writing this novel. It is about a meteorite found in the artic shelf which contains the  power to change the future of America. It revolves around a presidential election in which one candidate it totally corrupt and targets NASA's failures to gain popularity while the other candidate seeking reelection will not cheat the American people. Among the rapid paced plot of the novel i found many interesting facts along the way which not only made the novel interesting but rather educating.<br />A MUST READ!!
B00006690G|5.0|This is a very good album from Eminem. Although he does talk about his life a little too much I like this album. some of the best songs are Cleanin Out My Closet, Business, Soldier, Square Dance, Sing For The Moment, and Till I Collapse. Rest of the songs are just OK but overall this is a very good album. I wouldn't say the best in the world but a very good album.
B0000683DH|5.0|While most of the Trek films have met with varying degrees of success, THIS one is easily the best, and arguably the most successful of the bunch, being culled from one of the most rivetting episodes of the TV series - Space Seed.<br />As is often true of Trek stories, you can find almost everything here: humor, pathos, drama, excitement. This movie offers all these in spades, relying on many of the old series' tried-and-tested formulas: Bones and Spock in their famous debates; Kirk's think-on-your-toes, save the ship military genius; Kirk dealing with the inevitability of aging; terrific special effects, and of course the magnificent Ricardo Montalban as perhaps Kirk's most dangerous foe ever, the psychotically brilliant Khan Noonian Singh, alive and kicking after a 15 year exile on a barren planet where he lost most of his crew, including his beloved wife. This loss is the fuel for vengence as he sets out on a seek-and-destroy mission to annihilate the Enterprise. Both Kirk and Khan are excellent  strategists and the film pits them against each other in what is perhaps the greatest intergalactic chess game ever.<br />Shatner's acting may be a bit over-the-top in some scenes but he gives perhaps one of his best performances, as do all the cast. In my opinion though, it is Ricardo Montalban who steals the show with an absolutely rivetting performance that gives the film it's edge-of-your-seat excitement.
B000075BFK|5.0|It is amazing he made all these songs so quick and all of them are becoming hits. This album has something a little bit for everyone. The Intro was almost perfect and the whole cd is just a master piece. 2pac will most likely make other albums that past this one. If I did have to pic the best songs on here it be Thug Mansion (without Nas), Still Ballin, Street Fame, Catchin Feelins, This Life I Lead and the rest are pretty good. At the end of the album has a bonus track on the second disc and 2pac says &quot;Expect Me Ni*** Expect a Ni*** like you Expect Jesus to come back Expect me Ni*** I'm coming!&quot; what could he mean by that? But you know 2pac.
B000069HK2|5.0|The best band heard in a long time next to Taking Back Sunday!
B00005AQGH|5.0|2pac I mean Makaveli really took his time with these songs on the album. Hail Mary had one of the coldest beats known to man. None of the songs were just ok or good on this album. all of them were perfect. R I P 2pac aka Makaveli
B0001Z363W|5.0|Vol. 6 is a outstanding record in pure Zakk tradition. The record definetly follows in the footsteps of &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; with heavy acoustic/electric guitar and somber lyrics. Zakk is a true master of the guitar. The track &quot;stepping stone&quot; showcases some of the best guitar I have ever heard, even though its nothing complicated! The record is definetly one to put on the moring after a late night or when winding down! I have always been a fan of Pride and Glory and Book of Shadows so this hits the spot. Thank you Zakk for continuing to provide the world with music that is simply the best! Standout tracks: Steppin Stone, Won't find it here, Damage is Done. And to all those opposed, well!
B00003CWN3|5.0|A stunning movie.  Characters are multi-dimensional, flawed, fully human.  The filmmakers pull no punches in depicting the life of of Brandon/Teena.  I have nothing to add to the other review's commentary on the plot.  I just want to add my kudos.  The performances--all of them, not just Swank's--are outstanding. The movie hits the bullseye.  This film is a disturbing and moving experience, not to be missed.
B000002TQB|5.0|Seems an odd choice for #1, doesn't it?  From start to finish, this is one of the most pleasing musical experiences you'll ever have.  Never has an overwritten, overhyped, overproduced album lived up to everything everyone said about it.  Except for Parklife.<br />From the Euro-disco &quot;Girls and Boys&quot; to the pop standard &quot;To The End&quot; to the punk &quot;Bank Holiday&quot; to the commentary &quot;Parklife,&quot; this album is one of the most broad reaching and diverse ever.<br />Blur at their technical peak.
0679311718|5.0|This is an amazing book, written by an amazing man.  The phrase that can most describe it is &quot;screaming into the void&quot; as Dallaire tried so hard to save a country in a mission that would ultimately fail.<br />This book is crucial to read and it forces you to reconsider many of your beliefs, and now as we see a similar situation occuring in the Sudan, readers will be shocked to see how it is also being ignored.<br />Despite the painful failure of his mission, Dallaire is to me a hero and the faults lie not within UNAMIR, but within the beurocracy.  He said that he knows God exists because he shook hands with the Devil in Rwanda.  I would like to shake hands with Dallaire and thank him because without his sacrifices, things certainly would have been much worse.
0393317552|3.0|The timing of this book (1997), the authors obvious commitment to &quot;racial egalitarianism&quot; and the convenient awarding of a coveted Pullitzer Prize - thus guaranteeing huge publicity and sales - lends suspicion that GGS may have been deliberately &quot;commissioned&quot; by the \\"anti-racist\\" academic intelligentsia to neutralise the surprising success of the much-loathed \\"Bell Curve\\" (1994), a book which could never have been awarded a Pullitzer, given the left-wing bias of that committee.    <br />As my title suggests, GGS heavily promotes a left-wing political agenda although this may not have been noticed by the bevy of gushing 5-star reviewers below.  Which emphasizes the insidiousness of the PeeCee demand that, in order to appease \\"turd world\\" sensitivities, &quot;eurocentric&quot; history and achievements must always be slandered and denigrated - hence the title \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", all 3 destructive elements supposedly symbolic of \\"exploitative\\" white colonialists.  <br />JD establishes his true agenda as early as the 3rd page where he regurgitates the \\"blame it all on whitey\\" justification for the spectacular failure of virtually every black African state - \\"much of Africa is still struggling with its legacies from recent colonialism\\" - he dutifully proclaims.  Then, on page 19 he uses the word \\"loathsome\\" to describe those who would dare to consider that the human races are not exactly equal in intellect.   And yet, in almost the same breath he contradicts himself by saying \\"New Guineans impressed me as being more intelligent than Europeans or Americans\\".   Reverse that last statement and, hey presto, Pullitzer disappears in a puff of peecee.<br />The objective of this book is to answer \\"Yali's Question\\".   Yali was a New Guinean who, whilst strolling on a tropical beach, wondered aloud to JD - \\"why is it that you whites have so much `cargo' when us blacks have so little?\\"   JD's 400 page answer is an ingenious and (to the white liberal conscience) convincing attempt to explain away white success whilst avoiding the real reason (superior intellect) and thus remaining faithful to the gospel of innate racial equality.  <br />JD labours at great length how Eurasia (as opposed to America and Africa, but especially the latter for obvious reasons) was divinely favoured by the larger size of their grass-seeds, the horizontal shape of their continent(!!!), the number and usefullness of domesticable animals and, (inevitably) how unspeakable white people have raped, pillaged, enslaved, decimated, subjugated, colonised, and exploited dark-skinned races as they unfairly clawed their way to the summit of the human heap.   JD is also too fond of silly PeeCee statements such as \\"the oldest Java `man' fossils may actually have belonged to a Java woman!\\" or \\"Rhino-mounted Bantu shock troops could have overthrown the Roman Empire\\".    All in all he presents an ingenious but ultimately highly contrived case, whilst propping up the intellectual left's fantasy world of absolute and innate racial egalitarianism.  <br />The book is certainly a good read and makes interesting points some of which may even be valid, but ultimately his conclusion seems to be \\"well if whites are smarter than blacks its not because they are genetically superior - its because they were lucky..!   If blacks had originated in Europe and whites in Africa, the tables would have been turned..!\\"     A conclusion that could only have been made by a committed racial egalitarian.
0070511136|5.0|As a sales trainer, I found this book to present a wonderful methodology for both salespeople new to the business as well as seasoned salespeople. The SPIN principle (Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-payoff) works in almost any sales environment whether you are selling big ticket items to large accounts or volumes of small ticket items. <br />Overall, I found &quot;SPIN Selling&quot; to be a great book for addressing the strategic and tactical aspects of selling. In addition to this book, I highly recommend the book &quot;Cognitive Selling: Proven Fundamentals and Techniques of the World's Most Effective Salespeople&quot; by Todd Bermont. &quot;Cognitive Selling&quot; is the perfect complement to &quot;SPIN Selling&quot; as it provides a methodology for maintaining a winning attitude and frame-of-mind which is essential to succeed in selling.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Fantasy Movies. Neverending Story, Dark Crystal, Black Hole, Tron, etc. This movie is in the vein of those classic films.  Todays movies rely way too much on star power and special effects and not on heart. This is by far Tim Burton's best film and really a great movie.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Every so often, a fresh artist explodes onto the rap scene, with an album that the whole world says brings absolute fire. Enter Kanye West and his critically acclaimed debut LP, The College Dropout. This album is not only packed with Kanye's explosive beats - yes, he produced his whole album - but is also one of the few albums in my extensive collection that is so lyrically sound. Indeed, The College Dropout is an album that you can listen straight through, from start to finish, and be captivated every time. West brings us 21 tracks of pure magic, so I'll run down the cuts - <BR>1. Intro - Different from other Intro's I've heard, but this one's really good. Set's off 'The College Dropout' theme. ( - ) <BR>2. We Don't Care - A really feel good cut, one that's so easy to listen to. A solid start to the album. (5/5) <BR>3. Graduation Day - Another skit continuing the album theme.<BR>( - ) <BR>4. All Falls Down - Amazing, pure fire and such an amazing beat! This is the type of cut that's made Kanye's debut so popular. (5/5) <BR>5. I'll Fly Away - Another skit in the form of the song. Slightly annoying after 'All Falls Down' brilliance, but it sets up the next track. ( - ) <BR>6. Spaceship - In the top three tracks of the album - such an amazin song to listen to when you're playing the album straight through. (5/5) <BR>7. Jesus Walks - Another song in the top three tracks of the album. Such a diverse topic for an artist of Kanye's style, but his rhymes and wordplay on this cut makes a pure listening pleasure. (5/5) <BR>8. Never Let Me Down - Killer cut, except J. Ivy kinda brings down. An amazing track, but it falls short compared to the rest of the album. (4/5) <BR>9. Get 'Em High - Cool song, but not a standout. I play it sometimes, but mainly for Common's parts. (4/5) <BR>10. Workout Plan - Skit that leads us into the next song. ( - ) <BR>11. The New Workout Plan - Really good and different - proves what a lyricist Kanye is. (4.5/5) <BR>12. Slow Jamz - The cut that'sput Twista's next LP (Kamikaze) on the map as well as showing the ladies Kanye's softer side. Really easy to listen to - one of the albums high points. (5/5) <BR>13. Breathe In Breathe Out - I expected so much from this song, especially with Luda featuring, but it really fell short. Worst song on the album - the only down point. (3.5/5) <BR>14. School Spirit 1 - Another skit that continues The College Dropout theme. ( - ) <BR>15. School Spirit - Amazing, amazing, amazing. Addictive chorus, tight verses and beat - Kanye's genius shines on this track. (5/5) <BR>16. School Spirit 2 - Skit that rounds off the last three cuts. ( - ) <BR>17. Lil Jimmy Skit - Sets off the final part of the album ( - ) <BR>18. Two Words - Really good, such a good production job from Kanye with two good features: Mos Def &amp; Freeway (5/5) <BR>19. Through The Wire - The standout track of the album. Everyone's heard it, it's hard to describe how amazing it is - I listened to this for days straight when I copped the disc. (5/5) <BR>20. Family Business - So good, so uplifting and some really good keyboard pieces on Kanye's beat. (5/5) <BR>21. Last Call - The perfect round off track to complete an amazing album. It clocks in at about 13 minutes, with the last 10 being about how Kanye got his deal with the Roc, etc, etc. Really good. (5/5) <BR>I really suggest everyone buys this album if they haven't already. Kanye West is one of rap's future stars, in both his wordplay and his beats. I love hearing new material he's produced and I can't wait for his follow up LP. This is set to be one of 2004's top rap albums, proving that Kanye West is the future. Roc-A-Fella has recently suffered the retirement of Jay Z, and eveyone's eyes are on State Property, The Diplomats, YoungGunz and Kanye West to keep the label going. <BR>&quot;Tragedy To Triumph&quot; Kanye said - he could hold the down on his own. Rap album of the moment. Cop it. <BR>5 stars - pure classic.
6304240554|5.0|i bought  it on dvd before the remake came out and i found it awesome.night of the living dead is a classic and nothing but a classic .the story of the survivors hidding in a mall is a sure romero story line.it is super gory and really spooky.i find it shocking when you see a person alive one minute and a dead person trying to eat somebody the next minute.if you love zombie movies see this one.
B000148KK2|5.0|I always thought that Diana Krall was nice to listen to, but with nothing extra that made me buy any records of her. That was until I saw and heard her Live in Paris DVD, where the Canadian singer stepped out from the former slick and almost icy approach and delivered that extra. Suddenly you could feel the warmth in her voice, her ultra sensual charisma came through with full force - I was hooked. Still feel though that her albums are too polished for my taste, I stick with the fantastic live DVD.<br />Now Mrs Krall has made a studio album that connects to the feeling on the Live DVD. The musical setting is much more intimate than on her previous albums. Basically you have one tight band, where the two most impressive musicians to my ears are Anthony Wilson on guitar and Christian McBride on bass. Diana Krall herself sings like a goddess and plays a very good piano. The songs are a mix of jazz, blues and pop, with a more rootsy feeling than her usual repertoire. There are also a mixture of covers and original songs. The originals are all written by Diana Krall and Elvis Costello, though Costello has only contributed to the music on the majestic title track, otherwise he has stuck to the words. There is a natural flow to the song sequence on the album and the originals stand up very good to the covers. <br />There are in my opinion no weak songs on the album, and my favourites (today) are the title track (Krall/Costello) and Temptation (Tom Waits).<br />Audiowise the album is very good recorded and produced. <br />Highly recommendable!!
B0000033TE|4.0|Everything here is gen-yoo-wine grade A-1 first class excellence. There's nothing better than to put this album on and read trashy SF or comics. Perfect veg-out soundtrack stuff.<br />And then there's the @!!#$ annoying fifteen minute interview at the end. Why the @!!@# did these bozoes do that! We realize you're special and probably a bit shocked at all the stupid myopic critics who can't tell their nose from their armpit. Don't listen to them. They get the LP for free anyhow. If you really must put an interview on, stick it on a complementary second CD. Or better, a DVD (they can do that these days).<br />Go back to the studio, tweak some knobs and rerelease this one as a 31 year anniversary remaster guys. (Guranteed: 5 stars)

The SACD layer adds that extra HiFi dimension with crispy treble and a deep and tight bass. But the real winner here is clearly the multichannel mix. Diana's vocal is placed in the front channels and center and all instruments are spread in all channels in a rather aggressive but still very tasteful way. In my opinion a perfect 5.1 mix, compared to i.e. Norah Jones Come away with Me which has a very wimpy 5.1 mix. The only negative to say about the sound qualityis that from time to time you can hear some harschness to the s-sounds.<br />Highly recommendable!!
B000003S0P|5.0|The band assaults the ears with their extensive array of sounds and knocks you out. All the riffing is over-the-top in excellence. And the drums are played like riffing. If I was in Iraq and the Marine Corps was coming, this is what would be going through my head. The REAL shock and awe.<br />They should have hired these guys to do the Dune soundtrack. There's all these great aggressive macho harmonies and syncopations that mesh far better with Herbert's SF classic.

B0001BKAEY|1.0|Okay, so by now, everyone knows the first Matrix was groundbreaking in many ways and Reloaded had its spectacular moments.  With those two &quot;prequels&quot; how can you not go into Revolutions with some expectations? One slim hope would be that the final installment actually tie all the plot lines together and provide some insight into the philosophy that piloted the first two movies.  The first movie accomplished this feat in able fashion, the second with some turbulence and the third crash landed while boring a hole into the earth with its ineptitude.  I found it hard to watch this movie after the first 20 minutes.  I waited until the very end to see something redeeming; nope nothing worth while but a couple of meager scenes.<br />One comment had it right in that I could've cared less about any of the characters and the whole EMP being aboard the ships only was hideously stupid.  If the humans didn't make it in the matrix, I'd chalk one up for evolution.  They still might not make it based on one of the dumbest endings I have ever seen. Stay away, stay far away because there's nothing for you to see here.
B00001OH7T|4.0|If you skip the Beatles Cover, this is a nearly perfect Bowie release.  Another funk, soul and rock combo like Station to Station that has a very strong grove to it!  One of Bowie's better albums.
0451191153|4.0|As far as the philosophy in this book is concerned I don't think it teaches us anything we didn't know already but it does so very well and entertainingly.I found the book very sad at times because,all the way through it,I was reminded of life and the people and situations I've experienced at work and socially.I would find it hard to understand a reader who ,while reading,was not put in mind of many people in their own lives.I even thought of the LLoyds building in London which got a slating from the critics but I thought is fantastic.It's a compulsive read.I've a couple of gripes-one with the romantic side which just didn't do it for me and the didactisisms liberally spread through the book.I found also that the only character I really cared about in the end was G.Wynand.I read another review on this site by a reader slagging the book off and he reminded me of E.Toohey!I've given the book four stars because all the way through the book little things are striking a cord with me again and again.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Station to Station along with Young Americans are essential Bowie releases!<br />These two albums fuse jazz, funk and rock, leaving the listener clamoring for more.<br />And the vibe from Station to Station can't be topped!
0618526412|5.0|This book was genius.  Only a true genius herself could write such a powerful story about just a random points in these peoples lives.  Truly a must.
B00003CXTG|3.0|With so much material, I don't know why the makers of this film tried to remake the Titanic (guess it was for the money)...<br />Don't get me wrong, the film wasn't bad, but I was expecting a historical war movie (maybe I should stick to the History Channel or wait until Mel Gibson takes up this type of film).<br />The reenactment of the attack on Pearl Harbor redeemed the film from me - very realistic and much easier to stomach than the love triangle fodder...
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot are one of the best bands on Roadrunner's roster. They are very heavy, and this was by far their best album. And now, I get to see them at Ozzfest. How damn cool is that.
0553801546|5.0|I thought this book was by far the best of the Tawny Man series, not that I did not love the other two. I have not read the other two series by Robin Hobb, but after reading Fool's Fate I was convinced that I wanted to read the other series also, starting at the beginning and then re-reading the Tawny Man series. <BR>I thought that the character development was amazing and that you really know the characters... almost enough to guess their favorite color. I loved the developing relationships between the Prince and Elliania, Fitz and Nettle, even Thick and the other characters. The story was intriguing and I was always guessing the true reason for Elliania's challenge to Dutiful. Basically this book gets the position of my favorite book, at least until I stumble upon another great fantasy.
020161622X|5.0|I can only repeat what most other reviewers said: it's an extraordinary book, a real treasure. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, this book would deserve 6 -- but I must draw one star for the bulky design ;)<br />Information density is high and actually the book could be a small pocket book ideal to take along everywhere. But unfortunately the publishers preferred to use big typefaces, thick paper and include a lot of empty space. They probably blowed up the book to make it heavier and look &quot;more important&quot; in order to sell it for a higher price. For me, they didn't hit the target because I didn't buy the thing. I swear I would spend $40 rightaway if it would be as handy as it could but for now I stick to the electronic version.
B000148KK2|5.0|I think that this is Diana Krall's finest album to date.  The partnership with Elvis Costello seems to shine through and brings a new vitality and maturity to her music.  The recording is excellent.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Steven Spielberg has brought us the most touching movie we have ever seen. Its breath taking, beutiful and its the best movie I have ever seen. Its a movie to remember us what a human being is all about. No movie has ever impact me before, but this movie not only impact me, but it opened my eyes and changed me forever.
0385510438|1.0|I was extremely disappointed with the entire book. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it might get better. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and missing nothing in the process. The characters are all completely forgettable, and so is the story. The end was predictable, and any moron could have guessed why the jurors were being eliminated. <BR>Please don't write another book, Mr. Grisham. <BR>This was a complete waste of time.
1400031524|4.0|The book is interesting partly because Mankell suggests that the roots of the present mafia lie in the blackmarket network of the old communist system, and partly because the text was written before the total collapse of the USSR.<br />It's a powerful book, the scene where the fascist police storm in and kill the opposition is frightening, realistic, and bloodthirsty. So is the difficulty of making contact with Baiba, since both are watched. And the ending: who are the good guys, and who are the bad ones?<br />But Mankell strains the the will to believe too often. Why should Wallender, with a fake Latvian pass, go so far south and then enter the country illegally on foot? Not very likely that Wallender would have survived the massacre and escaped the building, either. Nor can I believe that Wallender could have found his way through the police headquarters, into the archive, and out again so easily. In the end, Mankell gives away a bit too soon who the bad guys really are.<br />One thing is puzzeling. Wallender did not connect with Baiba in the end. So, in later novels, is it only in his imagination that Baiba is his distant girlfriend? Mankell, realistically enough, does not present us with a happy life for the Commissar!<br />This review is based on the German translation \\"Hunde von Riga\\".
B000000OUJ|5.0|Best Wu solo joint of all time, period.  Only Wu related album that tops this is 36 Chambers - enough said.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|The DVD package of this two-disc set is extremely well done on the outside and a nice map included in the package for eventual framing is a nice touch. But the DVD special features aren't all that special when considering the cost of this \\"special\\" edition. Sure, you've got lots of documentaries, but let's face it, you've got that to choose from on most single-disc DVD sets these days if they're putting any kind of marketing into special features. Also, stunningly, I looked and checked and for some reason I guess I assumed there'd be some sort of actor's or director's commentary for this film. NOPE! This DVD package is highly overpriced and somewhat disappointing, akin to the film which I did not see in the theaters. There are some sweeping scenes and beautiful imagery, but some of the visual concepts were ripped right off from the 1984 epic, The Bounty, starring Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins (still, probably the greatest nautical film ever shot, in my opinion). Master and Commander has some strengths but this could be one of the most overrated films in a long time. The crew seems too happy, even after getting their butts spanked by the frogs and Lucky Jack is just too jovial for the most part. This is one of Russel Crowe's weaker efforts and he seems to be too impressed with himself on screen with this work. I'd have given this a two and a half star rating if I could have figured out how to do the half-star thing. Master and Commander is to The Bounty what U-571 is to Das Boot. Nice try, but it's just not as good as the originals they were trying to copy, although Master and Commander gives us some excellent glimpses into naval cannon warfare, clearly it's greatest accomplishment in this film.
0064471837|5.0|High and complex fantasy at its very best, \\"Sabriel\\" has an original and fascinating heroine, a unique world that places a medieval land beside a version of George V's England, and reams of magic and action. Unlike the many fantasy novels that try to copy Lord of the Rings by piling on enormous amounts of complex information and plot strands, Sabriel maintains a simple narrative thrust that drives the story at a fast pace. It will fascinate both the young adult audience at which it is aimed, and also older fantasy fans. Garth Nix's world is accessible to the teenage reader, and dazzlingly inventive to entrance the older reader.<br />The heroine, Sabriel, is a sorceress in training at Waverly College, an all-girl's school in the land of Alcestierre, a country that resembles World War I-era Britain. Across a great wall near the school lays the magical Old Kingdom, where Sabriel's father, the Abhorsen, works as a necromancer, using magic to keep the dead from crossing into the world of the living. Sabriel discovers that her father has become trapped in the world of the dead and she must cross the wall and enter the Old Kingdom to find him and rescue him. She is joined in her quest by a free magical creature trapped in a cat's body, Mogget, and an immature boy named Touchstone. Opposing them is a fearsome greater dead creature, Kerrigor, who desires Sabriel's death for his own fiendish purposes.<br />The protagonist is the book's strongest feature. Sabriel resists the female action-hero stereotype of women who simply act like muscle-bound males. She is intensely feminine and emotional, a teenager at heart but an adult in mind, and shouldering a heavy burden of responsibility that gives her a somber attitude. Almost any teenager will understand Sabriel's problems, for they are only slightly removed from their own: obedience to parents, the conflict of awakening maturity, and finding a place in the adult world. Sabriel also casts an air of mystery-she's an image of the beautiful unattainable, and can hold her own in a sword fight. Sabriel's romantic foil Touchstone is also a departure from fantasy norms. He is no swashbuckling he-man or equal to his female counterpart, but is something of a child. We can understand why these two begin to fall in love but at the same time cannot let it fully flower.<br />The roster of supporting characters is short, and Mogget is the most interesting. The cat creature's cynical attitude contrasts with Sabriel's inexperience and creates tension that carries much of the story.

0140544518|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I loved it when I was an elementary student, and even now as a high school student it still makes me crack a smile. If you haven't read it yet, what are you waiting for. And while you're at it, read the Stinky Cheeseman and Other Stupid Tales.

B00005KARK|4.0|Come on people. Get over your fears that your child will be permanently scarred and/or a juvenile delinquent just becuase they watch something that isn't totally sugar-coated, and then show them a great movie like this. I'll admit, this is undoubtedly one of the saddest movies in my memory, but that doesn't change the fact that it is a classic and should be a part of every kid's life. Disney movies are such a huge part of my life, I don't know what I'd be like if I was banned from watching them. Whatever, it's your decision and everything, but all this censorship is only going to make things go more down the toilet than they already have.
B00008DDXC|3.0|What can i say? The movie pretty much ruins the book. And I read all the hp books (1-5). But what I like in the movie is the special effects and stuff. You have to admit... it is pretty cool. What i don't like was some characters in the movie. some new actors in the movie are...well...not the best. Lucious Malfoy in the movie totally destroyed my expectation on the image. The movie is also fuzzy on the details. Furthermore, the movie skipped many important/ good events from the book. The DVD version of the movie has some intersting extras such as games and interviews which i liked.

B0001AVZA8|5.0|I for one am very biased against romantic comedies. A vast majority of them are extremely predictable and go nowhere for me. While some of that does apply to &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot;, however the main characters however though give this film a more original twist.<br /> Harry Sanborn is a 60 year old bachelor who never dates women over 30 years old and has fallen in love with another one...again except by this point he realizes he has been finding himself being attracted to someone who is in his age group (50+ years of ago) and this has started to make him think about his polygamous ways plus heart problems have plagued him.<br /> He starts to realize that the older woman, a Playwright worker and he share a lot in common and Harry realizes that he has a choice to make.<br /> This movie while stymied by some predictable elements, is a really smartly done movie in a lot of ways. No pun indended at all but many movies of this genre are focused on younger couples and this extremely formulaic pattern really ruins many movies in this category but SGG however steers clear of that by focusing on older characters.<br /> In some ways this film was bothersome but it was because it reminded me of someone one of my relatives dated years ago before things went sour.<br /> This is a great movie worth checking out.
0060090367|3.0|Unlike most books where it takes several chapters to get acquainted with the scenario and characters and really become engrossed in the story, Watermelon had me from the get-go. It was mid-way through when this excitement lost me. There was too much sadness and depression with this seemingly heartwarming tale. It deals with a disasterous situation and a main character who is just full of juxtapositions. She's supposed to be strong-willed, yet her actions show insecurity and dependency. Her past alludes to being the life of the party yet her present is full of shying away from life's glory. <br />At the end, you wanted her to be happy for the mere reason that you feel as if she's about to literally crumble in front of your eyes. I, myself, am not the toughest gal in the least, but I had the sense to know that what she did was just downright stupid and an insult to any woman who has lost a man. It happens, life goes on, things can ALWAYS be worse. <br />I don't usually like those chick lit novels where the main character is a bubbly bodacious blonde, but it sure as hell beats this grandma trapped in a 29 year old's body. After this read you will need to follow up with some Bergdorf Blondes by Plum Sykes pronto! It's the most superficial read I have ever gone through, but it is the refreshing glimpse of envious life that you will need after Watermelon.
B00001QEE9|5.0|&quot;Doesn't matter who you are, if you wish upon a star your dreams come true.&quot;<BR>I saw this movie when I was very small and still to this day LOVE Jiminy Cricket. The Blue Fairy has always stuck in my memory, I just love her. This is such a classic, a must see for everyone. I am personally outraged by the fact that so many parents are up in arms because their children &quot;SHOULD NOT be exposed to this kind of imagery.&quot; What a bunch of crap. I saw it and I'm 15 now, I turned out fine. Anyway, once people get over themselves and their prudish, overprotective ways of thinking they will see how wonderful this movie really is. But enough of my ranting, Pinocchio is a masterpiece.
B00005JM02|5.0|I loved the movie. The graphics were absolutly breath-taking. They were very detailed and beautiful. Besides the graphics, the story was so cute and funny. You can never get tired of watching this movie. Usually i don't find &quot;children movies&quot; entertaining. I just think they're cute. But &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a movie that every family member can enjoy. The characters are wonderful and halarious and the lines that the characters say are perfectly fitting.
B00018D44U|2.0|When I bought her `Come Away with Me' album, I enjoyed the non-commercialized rich jazz-like music she produced.  <br />Unfortunately, she has now entered the world of pop stardom and this reflects in `Feels like Home'. This offering has ventured too far towards `country' to be called jazz / soul.  I'm sure it will still sell a couple of million copies based on the expectation one had following `Come Away with Me', Next time, I will first listen to the CD in the music shop before buying it. Her music has gone from being excellent to being mediocre at best. <br />I have to give this CD a qualified thumbs down.
B00008973Q|5.0|Kurosawa has tackled Shakespear before, like in the brilliant Throne Of Blood, but in this film he shows why he is one of the greatest directors of all time. Kurosawa was in his 70's at the time of making this film and proves he never lost his edge.<BR>     The story is set in the time of the samurai. A lord is turning over his rule to his oldest son, a desision that dose not sit well with his youngest son, who warns his father that his move will cause nothing but pain, and betrayal. He proves to be correct.<BR>      The movie is just like Kurosawa's other films in that it has the feel of a grand, sweeping epic but never makes you feel like you'r watching Ben-Hur. THe cinamatopraphy is outstanding and the acting is some of the best I have ever seen in a Japaness film, or any for that matter.<BR>      If you are looking for one of Kurosawa's best works this is a great place to start if you haven't already seen The Seven Samurai, this is a great peice of film making and somthing every film maker can learn from.  I just wish as many people saw this film as have seen the last Friday The 13th, that would be sonmthing.
0064431789|5.0|Where the Wild Things Are was my favorite bedtime story as a child. It opened up a world of imagination that isn't all fluff and nicety. Imagination can lead to adventures and even nightmares can become adventures. I think every little kid has been sent to his or her room at one time and had to rely on imaginatin to wile the time away.
B00005RDSM|4.0|This is a great movie for kids, I loved it when I was little. I still think it's great. What I don't understand is this whole racist thing. I'm pretty sure that I am one of the only people who honestly doesn't think about racial issues at all when watching movies like this. My aunt is full-blooded Cherokee Indian and she loves this movie. I guess I just don't think about things the way many others do. I don't want to get into a discussion of all this p.c. propoganda. All I'm saying is, this movie is definitely a classic, and should be a part of any kid's life.
B00003CX9E|5.0|If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a motion picture is worth a million words. Unfortunately, Amazon limits reviews to a thousand words only so I'll have to be brief but no amount of words can do justice to &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot; <br />I can't, and therefore won't, pretend to be &quot;objective&quot; about this film.  As the great Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci once said, &quot;Objectivity does not exist - it cannot exist ... The word is a hypocrisy which is sustained by the lie that the truth stays in the middle. No, sir: sometimes truth stays on one side only.&quot; <br />In the case of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; the truth is on one side only: it is a truly great film and deserves to be ranked as one of the greatest films, if not the greatest film, ever made. And anyone who says otherwise is not only wrong but grossly ignorant of this film, the history of film, and its place in the history of film.<br />A few key highlights on &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;<br />First, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is a work of art. (Yeah, I know that is a cliche, but like most cliches, it's true).  Most movies are merely entertaining because that is all they are meant to be and do. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; tried to be more and do more and succeeded.<br />Second, Orson was a genius and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was his masterpiece.<br />Third, its screenplay is itself a masterpiece. Just as matter of fact, the actual shooting script was based on two scripts (written separately by Welles and Mankiewicz) that Welles combined into one for the final version. By the way, best screenplay was the only category that garnered an Academy Award for &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;  By rights, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; should have won all the categories but did not because of the efforts of William Randolph Hearst (incredibly, the real Hearst was even worse than the man &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; portrayed!).<br />Third, the look (and sound) of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is glorious. Gregg Toland was one of the greatest cinematographers in the history of film, period, and &quot;Kane&quot; proves it. Without going into the boring (actually not boring) technical details, this film was ahead of its time and used many techniques for the first time that we have long since gotten used to. Unfortunately, we have forgotten where they came from. <br />Welles and his cinematographer Gregg Toland developed or enhanced techniques for allowing the drama to develop on multiple planes of vision and sound. the film's deep focus photography, which allows actors and objects to remain in focus whatever their distance from the camera, allowed multiple actions to be shown within a single frame and remain comprehensible, allowing for complex interactions between foreground and background.<br />Welles and John Aalberg created a complex soundtrack that merged multiple dialogues, sometimes spoken simultaneously, and music into a comprehensible whole.<br />Fourth, Bernard Herrmann. Do I need to say anything more? Although Bernard Herrmann received an Academy Award nomination for his score for &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; he actually won the award that year for his music for ALL THAT MONEY CAN BUY.<br />Fifth, the film editing was fantastic. Kudos to Robert Wise.<br />Sixth, the extraordinary cast of actors were drawn entirely from the famed Mercury Theatre troupe, which Orson Welles founded when he was only 21 years old. <br />Seventh, It was directed by Orson Welles.<br />Eighth, It was produced by Orson Welles.<br />Ninth, Charles Foster Kane was portrayed by Orson Welles.<br />Tenth, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was made by Orson Welles. Did I mention that he shared the credit for best original screenplay?<br />I think there is a pattern here. <br />Bottom Line: If &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is not already in your DVD collection, get the two-disc set, you won't regret it.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|This CD is perhaps one of the most inspiring CDs I have ever heard. I am an aspiring author, and several tracks have provided inspiration for themes or characters in my stories, most notably the track The White Tree. That one piece gave me a basis for an entire plotline. Also inspiring was the Riders of Rohan, the Fields of the Pellenor, and The Steward of Gondor.<BR>Getting off the inspirational aspect, the music overall is just stupendous. Howard Shore has clearly showed his mastery in composing, and I hope to hear his works in other upcoming movies.
B000000JO3|5.0|This album rocks!!  I was reading the other reviews and one talked about a different one that said that this wasn't *TRU* punk.  Dude, you can't get more punk than minor threat.  Ya, some of those bands are good but there not true punk.  Bands like Minor Threat are because of their raw sound and they totally rock.  This album is sweet.  If your a punk rock fan, definitely buy this album.
B00005JLWN|4.0|I saw this movie recently at a friends place, somewhat reluctantly.<br />\\"Oh boy, another Matrix clone...yawn.\\"<br />But a few minutes in Im like \\"Hey, this is like Farenheit, 1984, and BNW all shoved together!\\", and it had my interest.<br />The plot has some thin areas, no question, but as a paranoid future dystopia cautionary tale type of story its pretty good. <br />Taking a page from Brave New World everyone is on a mood altering drug; however whereas BNW's soma was a pep-pill, the Equilibrium drug is a emotion-suppressor, rendering people into calm, cool, and collected living mannikins. <br />Taking a page from 1984 the Tetragrammaton is a Big Brother-esque government, though they seem to rely more on human surveilance than on electronic spying, which suppresses art, culture, and entertainment as they engender to many emotional upwellings. There are also constant 1984-esque propoganda broadcasts, and the \\"sense offense\\" concept of the movie is pretty much the same thing as the \\"thought crime\\" of 1984. <br />The Fahrenheit 451 similarities mostly show up in the fact that art and various bric a brac are burned when found, and in the parrallels between the main characters; also, one could find some similarities in the puppy the main character becomes attached to and the little girl next door in '451.<br />Of course, having been made post-1998 the movie also has some martial arts. Even Yoda is a ninja these days, afterall. In this case however rather than more ho-hum Wire Fu we are presented with the concept of the Gun Kata, which sounds cheesy, but is actually somewhat compelling. At the very least its original, and that's got to count for something?<br />Like any good martial arts Gun Kata makes it practitioner invincible, or at least unbeatable by anyone else in the film. The focus of Gun Kata is a scientific analysis of the most probable angles of fire in a gunfight, enabling a practitioner to  simultaneously avoid being shot and deliver highly accurate fire even in total darkness and at both close and medium range. It also has a melee component consisting of pistol whipping with extreme prejuidice anyone that gets too close.<br />Unlike the wire-enabled gyrations of the Matrix, the Gun Kata is very stationary; the practitioner basically plants their feet and  becomes the focal point of a fire fight. Since the \\"art\\" is supposed to be trajectory based this even makes a certain amount of sense.<br />Cinematically this results in frenetic action packed sequences of  very tightly shot violence that is actually really striking and distinctive. There is also some kendo/japanese katana fighting in the movie which is interesting, but much less interesting than the Gun Kata  scenes IMO.<br />There is one scene towards the end that is obviously Matrix inspired, and the black outfit worn by the \\"senior\\" Grammaton Clerics (basically the ultra-chic \\"too sexy for my goth look\\" equivalent of Thought Police in the movies setting, or to put it another way for the comic book crowd like the Judges from Judge Dredd) is very Neo-esque, but otherwise this movie owes more to Bradbury, Orwell, and Huxley both thematically and stylistically than the Wachowski brothers or Hong Kong Wuxia. <br />Sean Bean is in the movie for about 5 minutes, as is the guy that played Robert the Bruce from Brave Heart, and Taye Diggs is another Grammaton Cleric who has maybe 10 minutes of screen time, but the movie revolves around Christian Bale. This guy is the king of minimalist expressionism. The merest fluctuation of his facial expression can communicate volumes. He was perfectly cast in this role, and I'm really looking forward to seeing him as Bruce Wayne in the next go around of the Batman franchise.<br />Bale plays a top-mark senior Grammaton Cleric who is basically the bizomb. The only mar on his record is that he failed to detect his wifes \\"sense crime\\" and turn her in for execution himself a few years previously. After going off his emotion-suppresent drug Bale basically becomes the Guy Montag/Winston Smith/Bernard Marx parrallel of this particular dystopian tale, proceeds to get involved in the de riguer anti-establishment underground, and turns his abilities against the oppressor Big Brother state. Fight the Power! You know the drill, standard dystopian fare from there on out, but with frenetic fight scenes. <br />As an aside, I bet that if 1984 was made into a big screen Hollywood movie next year Winston Smith would be a master of some kind of martial art and would kick some serious Party behind in the last 15 minutes of the movie. Nothing Hollywood loves more than a proven formula! But I digress....<br />So in summary, if you are a fan of dystopian fiction/literature and havent seen a decent action flick in a while, this movie is a way to satisfy both tastes all in one easy to swallow go. Keep your expectations reasonable and you'll have a good show.
B00004R99J|4.0|&quot;What I love most about rivers is you can't step in the same river twice. The water's always changing, always flowing. But people I guess can't live like that, we all must pay a price. To be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing what's around the riverbend.&quot;<BR>What really stands out in Pocahontas, to me, is the music. Not so much fancy special effects and stuff, but the songs are beautiful. The lyrics and the music just flow. The colors are vibrant and rich, truly a great film. I know every word to every song. All my friends do, and we range from 15 to 24. Maybe we're just sad... oh well!<BR>&quot;Is all my dreaming at an end? Or do you still wait for me, dreamgiver, just around the riverbend?&quot;

Good ol' &quot;Alan Parson's Pine Fresh Ammonia Avenue&quot; - that's what we called it when it came out. The music stinks as bad as the chemical.  Do yourself a favor - If you're a progressive rock fan, stop at Pyramid.  Then start again at Stereotomy.  Everything in between was sugar coated sickening pap.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|I recently bought this CD on a splurge. It turned out to be one heck of a great purchase. Gavin's voice and lyrics touch you on EVERY song. There wasn't a single one that I don't like. I even made my mom and best friend go buy the CD. Gavin is one of those artists who can take you to a different place with each song. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|...but that's not an option. Quite frankly this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. While the special effects are neat, I can see no reason for a 15 minute car chase (that quickly becomes boring) or a way too long sex scene. While the acting is still the same quality I found that the writing (especially the way too preachy parts) lacking.
1920769005|5.0|Words can barely describe how incredible Shantaram is - I was completely blown away with this incredible journey. It's inspiring, horrifying, uplifting, moving and completely unputdownable - don't think I've ever been affected by a book as much. While some friends commented that they'd be daunted by a book of this size, it's so engrossing that you're devastated to discover that you've finished the last page before you know it. Roberts weaves his amazing experiences in India with really powerful musings on his own failings, life philosophies and thoughts on freedom and love. His writing is so soulful and powerful you end up falling in love both with India itself and with the characters that fill his page. I can't recommend this book enough. I'm dying to get in contact with Roberts to let him know what an impact his writing has had.
0393324818|5.0|Being a British naturalised Kiwi, I could not possibly know (or, to be honest, care) less about baseball. Nonetheless, I found this to be a fascinating book, and have been recommending it to everyone I meet. It contains a fundamental truth of investing that anyone could use, useful precisely because most people (like the low-scoring reviewers on this site) think they know best.<br />If every armchair sports fans thinks they know better than the others, it stands to reason that most of them are wrong.<br />The fact that the Oakland A's never won the world series is absolutely not the point. If the market was functioning efficiently, on their budget, they should never have got within cooey of it: The buying power of behemoths like the Mets should have ensured that. What is remarkable - and what is important - is that the A's consistently, massively, exceeded their own expectations.<br />Sport is a business. I mean that figuratively as well as literally: profit can be measured in dollar terms but also in percentage of wins to losses. Fans seem to forget that. In business, consistently exceeding expectations is an even better thing than winning the World Series, because it necessarily means you've made MONEY. If you're the favourite and you win the World Series, you have only met expectations, and you may even have made a loss.<br />If baseball were a perfect market, it wouldn't be possible to exceed expectations over a long period. Over a few games, maybe - that could be a fluke. Over two seasons, it almost certainly couldn't be. That means two things: (a) conventional wisdom about the value of certain baseball players and certain attributes is wrong; and (b) The Oakland A's have worked out what is right, or at any rate their model is better than the conventional wisdom.<br />This is the sort of thing Billy Beane should have kept as quiet about as possible. Michael Lewis' book ought to be a Eureka moment for every baseball manager: if it is, then the market mis-pricing will disappear, everyone will acquire players on the strength of the new valuation methodology and the Oakland A's will gradually fall down the rankings to where they should have been in the first place, given their budget. I dare say that has already started to happen.<br />What it ought to do is open eyes of managers from other codes, and indeed other businesses: The key is in having sufficient data. If you have enough good quality data (like baseball does) then if your analysis of it is better than your competitors, then as long as your approach is disciplined and consistent, you will, over time, turn a virtually risk free profit. It's called arbitrage.<br />I haven't even got onto the fact that Michael Lewis is one of the most insightful and witty writers writing in business at the moment, and this book is a pleasure to read from start to finish, notwithstanding my ignorance of its subject. I have read a number of business titles recently, and compared to the rest of the pack Lewis is, if you'll excuse the pun, a major leaguer amongst amateurs.<br />Highly, highly recommended.<br />Olly Buxtoning will disappear, everyone will acquire players on the strength of the new valuation methodology and the Oakland A's will gradually fall down the rankings to where they should have been in the first place, given their budget.

B000053VAF|3.0|A friend asked me a while back if I'd ever seen a Kevin Smith movie.  As much as I try to keep up with cinematic trends, I had to admit I hadn't quite gotten around to Mr. Smith's work so far.  So recently, I made a point to pick one up.  Freud says there are no accidents, so does that mean that I unconsciously sat down to watch DOGMA in the wee hours of a Sunday morning before I realized it was, in fact, EASTER SUNDAY?  And if so, does that mean, I'm merely irreverent--or completely sacreligious. This while everyone else is trundling off to take in THE PASSION.  Yikes! I scare myself.<br />Oh, wait.  I read what others have posted and am somewhat relieved.  Smith himself does not view the film as sacrilege.  It's his funny Valentine to the Church itself.  (Don't expect flowers in return, Kev, but at least a few of us lapsed get your drift).  And, hey, as even Madonna is quick to point out, once a Catholic always a Catholic.<br />It doesn't really matter that the theological ramblings of some of the characters are kind of sophomoric,  even freshmanic.  Even you've ever had an all-night theological bull session in college, you'll relate.  And it doesn't really matter that the characters who most often indulge in the bull throwing are in fact angels who should probably know better.  After millenia of being banished to the third ring of Wisconsin, how can you expect much else?  And why are these angels named after the Norse god of thunder and a Herman Melville's less than motivated scrivener?<br />In other words, this movie really is a movie of ideas.  Whether these ideas are really all that profound is another matter.  Can Church law actually be twisted in such a way that the very universe unravels?  Can God possibly look like Alanis Morissette--and sound like a Wookie?  These are questions that won't keep anyone up at night, but the movie is just brainy enough to let the eggheads and the budding theologians in on the overall fun.<br />And it is fun.  Good cast, pretty good script--dialog that is mostly sharp (with some clunker lines interspersed among the gems).  Unfortunately, as the amazon.com critic above observes, the movie suffers due to direction that is only fair to middlin'.  It took me a while to realize that the actors weren't off, so much as the pacing.  A lot of the dialog seems rushed.  Linda Fiorentino is normally such a natural, but in many scenes her dialog seems alternately rushed and repetitive.  Eventually, it dawned on me that she (and Alan Rickman and other normally very good actors) had been indeed been &quot;on,&quot; but the camerawork, the choppy delivery of lines and overall pacing--all directorial concerns--contributed to the impression that the actors weren't doing all they could.  (Actually, they were probably doing MORE, actually working harder than usual.)  I mean, Chris Rock should always be slam dunk funny.  Here he has his great and not-so-great moments.<br />So the film remains something of a shaggy dogma story. And if  you keep that in mind, you'll likely find the film a lot of fun.  I don't know how it fits in with his entire oeuvre, but it piqued my interest to check out more. Kevin Smith is an original talent. And besides, Jay and Silent Bob are cool guys.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|With the release of their second album D12 has shown much needed growth. They are rapping with the beat alot more on this release than they did on their first outing. Eminem is featured on almost every song. Bizarre of course is a nut on this disc. Saying things that a normal person wouldn't even think of. But after listening to this disc multiple times I recommend it to any Eminem fan and D12 fan. Great sophmore album!
B000056NX5|1.0|I'm sorry I may be the minority who preferred the 70s version, maybe I'm getting old and sentimental. To me, the singing seems jarring and over acting, especially &quot;see my tongue I can hardly talk&quot;, and the Gothic makeup weren't to my liking. And a blue-eyed Jesus ? I know this is acting, but at least infuse some reality for believers of the Christian faith. Thanks.
B00003CY5J|5.0|Robert DeNiro, as usual, makes the acting profession look as easy as a stroll down 5th Avenue, with yet another winning performance in &quot;The Score&quot; -- a crime saga that's definitely worth a look.<br />You might find yourself moving closer and closer to the edge of your seat as this film's suspenseful climax slowly approaches. I think Director Frank Oz does a good job of gradually building the suspense as the movie progresses.<br />Edward Norton, who has a &quot;double&quot; role (of sorts) in the movie, also gives a knockout performance.  I found it worthwhile to replay several of Norton's hilarious scenes while he was in character as the half-witted janitor's helper.<br />And I really liked Marlon Brando in this film.  The then-76-year-old Brando, who portrays the slightly-quirky &quot;Max&quot;, isn't too &quot;heavy-handed&quot; here; and comes through with a couple of knee-slapping lines of dialogue to boot during his brief amount of screen time.<br />The DVD of &quot;The Score&quot; offers up mighty fine video and audio quality.  The 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen picture looks just about perfect to my eyes.<br />Extra Features include a &quot;Making The Score&quot; featurette (which lasts 12:25).  This is a fairly standard Making-Of program (but still nice to have on the disc), with a few behind-the-camera glimpses of the actors at work.<br />There are also three pieces of &quot;Additional Footage&quot; (total run time for these segments amounts to 7:58).  The first one is extremely intriguing.  It's a completely uncut, uninterrupted piece of film (5:05 in length) featuring Robert DeNiro and Marlon Brando discussing the heist and DeNiro's price for pulling off the job.  We see three versions of this scene within this one single unbroken strip of film -- each of which is slightly different from the others, with these two great acting legends improvising a lot of the dialogue along the way.  And each one of these differing &quot;takes&quot; is perfect.  They never blow a word in any of the versions.  The first version shown is the one that ended up in the final film; but the other two are just about as good (with Brando's rather racy remark in the last take being laugh-out-loud funny).<br />The other two items listed under &quot;Additional Footage&quot; are alternate takes from two scenes in the film.<br />Other DVD bonus materials include a Director's Commentary Track and the Theatrical Trailer.<br />&quot;The Score&quot; boasts of three generations of acting talent coming together on the same movie -- a movie whose cast and story are both equally up to the task of entertaining anyone who pops in this DVD.They never blow a word in any of the versions.

B00003CXHJ|4.0|I have followed Submarine movies since my childhood. I was always fascinated with what it would be like to be aboard one. I even went inside a German U-boat at a museum. I have been aboard ships, which although not as cramped they still give you a bit of the feel of what a sailors life is like. I have seen great sub movies like \\"Das Boot\\" and \\"The Enemy Below\\". Fans of the movie \\"Breakdown\\" will find that the same author/director did a fine job on this fictional submarine movie as well. U-571 is not meant to be a historically accurate telling of the Enigma story. It was meant to be entertaining fiction and nothing more. In that respect it is pretty good, in fact borderline great. It has plenty of tense moments and a fast pace to keep the interest of most fans of WWII movies. Like many war movies it is not the exact truth of what really happened, but it is dedicated in honor of Allied sailors. The Allied forces wanted to get their hands on an Enigma device during the war. It saddens me that so many vote negative, not because they think badly of our reviews so much as they don't like us enjoying a movie about Americans winning in a fictional WWII story. Is this jealousy voting?<br /><br />The true story is the British ships HMS Bulldog and HMS Aubretia captured an enigma device from a German U-Boat, U-110, on May 9, 1941. The German sub failed to sink because in their rush to abandon ship they forgot to blow the tanks. The British went aboard and found the Enigma and coding documents. Even then the Brits had to work hard at the code for some time since the Germans wised up to so many of their subs being sunk. The Germans added a another wheel to the Enigma device making the code far more complex with more possible variations. The British at Bletcheley Park again worked around the clock. They even came up with the first computer and successfully cracked the code. Be sure to catch the movie \\"Enigma\\" if this interests you. U-571 pays tribute to the Allied forces that risked their lives to capture Enigma devices and documents. There never was a mission like this movie indicates during WWII and especially not with any Americans involved. I still like this movie as entertainment, and I appreciate it being  dedicated to Allied sailors. People that enjoy the vast majority of WWII movies will probably find this movie worthwhile, and I would even venture to say that it has replayability. If you want a movie that gives you more of the facts, catch Enigma, but realize they took a little poetic license in it as well. I bought the DVD and the picture and sound quality is good.r lives to capture Enigma devices and documents.

0385336810|5.0|I have never reviewed anything with the best possible rating, until now. Can You Keep A Secret? actually deserves it.  This is the only book I have read that truly deserves all five stars.  It was Kinsella at her best.  The novel was laugh-out-loud funny, and I must say, I actually did a minimum ten times.  There were many of those moments when you go back to re-read the same passage in case you missed something, but you still laugh just as hard the second time around.  I can honestly say I enjoyed these more than the Shopaholics, mainly because the main character is more likeable.  She is realistic and genuine - truly someone I would want to be friends with.  I believe any woman who often speaks before running her words through her 'filter' would love this novel as much as I did.

B00009V7P8|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim, after hearing a live recording of &quot;Delicate&quot; on the radio, and I am not disappointed. Damien's ability to blend songs together and make one song sound like three astounds me. The music itself is beautifully beguiling, melodically mesmerizing, harmoniously haunting, and lyrically lingering. Each track has its own unique sound and makes me want to cry just a little bit for different reasons. It's the kind of music that you want to really listen to, and let it touch you. I can't recommend this album highly enough.
B000002KIK|3.0|As everyone navigating to this page knows, NEVER SAY DIE! (1978) was the last album Black Sabbath did with Ozzy Osbourne as their lead singer. Ozzy, who was rife with drug/alcohol abuse, had quit the band after recording the subpar TECHNICAL ECSTASY (1976). He formed a new band called The Blizzard Of Oz, which was basically a glorified solo project; however, after not being able to secure a record deal, this project soon fizzled. Ozzy then decided to return to Black Sabbath in early 1978 to record what would be his swansong with the group. <br />NEVER SAY DIE! begins with the under-four-minute title song as the album opener. Aside from being their first title song in five years (since &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; from the album of the same name in 1973), it was easily their best album opener in three years (since &quot;Hole In The Sky&quot; from SABOTAGE in 1975). An old-fashioned rock'n'roll stomper with the amps turned all the way up to 11 (sorry, couldn't resist the old Spinal Tap joke), it is impossible for any true Black Sabbath fan to not love it. Musically, all four bandmembers are in fine form. Ozzy's high-pitched delivery makes a fine contrast to the deep-chord crunch of Tony Iommi, who delivers one killer guitar solo towards the end. Bill Ward &amp; Tony &quot;Geezer&quot; Butler make a fine rhythm section on this song. Lyrically, &quot;Never Say Die&quot; is probably the most positive song they ever did! Despite this confident beginning, the album soon gives way to the same kind of unfocused malaise that marred their previous album. <br />&quot;Johnny Blade&quot; begins with a weird-but-interesting keyboard solo from guest Don Airey (who would go on to become Ozzy Osbourne's keyboardist on his first four solo albums). This song contrasts heavily with the opening track in three major ways: 1) Instead of dealing with life, it deals with death; 2) It is mid-tempo, not fast; 3) At 6:27, it is nearly double the length. The result is a kind of rambling track about this fictional character that we really don't care about. Not one of the Sabs' worst, but definitely not among their best. Next is the even-longer &quot;Junior's Eyes,&quot; which, as we all know, was written by Ozzy about dealing with the death of his father. After a rather weird-sounding, bass-heavy, jazzy beginning, the song kicks into high gear on the choruses, on which you can clearly hear the pain in Ozzy's voice, as he sings: <br />&quot;You're coming home again tomorrow<BR>I'm sorry, it won't be for long<BR>With all the pain, I've watched you live within<BR>I'll try my hardest not to cry when it is time to say goodbye.&quot; <br />This was some of Ozzy's best and most heartfelt lyrics in a long time. The band played powerfully, but again, the song is just kind of rambling. On &quot;Hard Road,&quot; the band play with a rollicking feel that reminds me of Slade; however, it lacks the charisma of any Slade song. Ozzy harmonizes with himself in a kind of monotonous way; the result is a rather flat-sounding song that just sounds tired. However, the excellent opening riff-bass-drum combination on &quot;Shock Wave&quot; then wakes things up. Iommi's amazing guitar solo on this song sounds like Jimi Hendrix walked in from the afterlife to give the band a hand. The galloping drumbeat of Bill Ward keeps things exciting enough to make the song stay listenable. Ozzy sings well here, too. <br />&quot;Air Dance&quot; has often been singled out as the refreshingly different track on here, and for good reason! With its jazzy piano punctuating the verses and dominating the midsection, along with some very jazzy guitar-work by Tony Iommi, it really works as a great fusion song, before the term &quot;fusion&quot; came into vogue. It's not terribly exciting, but it's definitely different! But it's &quot;Over To You&quot; that deserves the most credit. With its great keyboard-over-guitar riff intro that sounds like Bad Company marching in, and with its rather dreamy-sounding, piano-driven chorus, this song really kicks (in a mid-tempo kind of way), and becomes what I think is the second-best song on this CD. The lyrics are one part mystical, one part somber, and definitely open to interpretation; in other words, in seems to be a return to the band's glory days. <br />But now we get into the most controversial part of the album. Beginning with the two-and-a-half minute instrumental track &quot;Breakout,&quot; which begins with a nice, slow drumbeat which is soon joined in by an equally slow guitar riff, which is then joined in by---gasp!---saxophone, and then---even more gasps!---a horn section. It actually ends up becoming an extended intro for the very last song, &quot;Swinging The Chain.\\" It is a bit of bitter irony that the very last Black Sabbath song of the Ozzy era is not sung by Ozzy at all! Instead, it is sung by Bill Ward, who gets his second chance to shine on lead vocals (remember that the first time was on &quot;It's Alright&quot; from TECHNICAL ECSTASY). He does so, rendering a really good rock'n'roll performance, with even a bit of screaming for good measure! In the meantime, Ozzy goes at the harmonica like a madman; it's his second best such performance since &quot;The Wizard!&quot; Musically, the song is kind of disjointed and weird; it's broken up into three parts, even though it's only a bit over four minutes. Also, it's kind of hard to tell exactly what the song's about, but it has to do with England during World War II and the fallout from that---I think.<br />Well, there you have it: not among the Sabs' best and it was definitely time for a change after this. Ozzy left for good to pursue what became a phenomenally successful solo career, and Black Sabbath got Ronnie James Dio to revitalize their sound for the `80's. It all worked out for the best.<br />MODERATELY RECOMMENDED

B00005JMEW|1.0|While this is a dramatic shift for Uma Thurman and her own achievement in martial arts, don't be fooled.  This is another Quentin Tarantino tribute to his own overdone &quot;style&quot; and gratuitously violent, intellectually stunted, and generally meaningless caricature (literally and figuratively) of the old revenge story.  Nothing new here.  Purchase at your own risk, but really -- don't bother! It's a waste of your hard-earned money and your time.  Life is too short for this drivel.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I liked this film so much more than I thought I would. It clearly does not take itself too seriously; the trademark violence found in every Quentin Tarantino flick is present here also, but it's so over the top, it's cartoonish. Supposedly, gallons upon gallons of fake blood were used in the making of &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, which was originally intended to be released as one complete, 3+ hour movie, but then it was split into two volumes so as not to make the moviegoer sit through a marathon, as in the case of the three &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot; films.
B00008S2VG|5.0|One of the best albums of 2004, it still remains at the top of the worlds charts and hit parades with its successfull, innovative singles. In Europe, Madge penned 5 non-stop chart-topping singles, which are AMERICAN LIFE, HOLLYWOOD, NOTHING FAILS, LOVE PROFUSION and DIE ANOTHER DAY. The track NOBODY KNOWS ME, title of a photo book released this winter, was a big hit in the dance clubs and the songs INTERVENTION and MOTHER &amp; FATHER became huge fan-favourites. EASY RIDE is a new &quot;must&quot;  on Madonnas repertoire and one of her best productions. IM SO STUPID is also very popular among fans, because of its beats and rhythms. <BR>But if the condition for you to buy an album is the success of its singles in the Billboard Hot 100, dont buy it: it only contains 2 high-charting singles in the US, DIE ANOTHER DAY #8 and AMERICAN LIFE #37.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Don't be fooled by some of the above reviews - this is one great movie. Outstanding acting and masterful storytelling. I feel sorry for people who can't enjoy this gem.
B000002VCB|5.0|This album is one of many many many that express the feelings of the composer/artist.  The point of view of this album is of a man who is angry with a woman.  This also is not a first.  Picasso, for example, portreyed his women increasingly distorted the more he tired of them.  Don't let that turn you off from this album.  <br />Most of the songs are good, some are excellent.  The track by Leslie Duncan is one of my favorites and has prompted me to find out more about her. <br />Classic Alan Parsons.
B00018D44U|4.0|Objectively, this is a fine, highly listenable disc.  It is not as good as her first album.  Sophomore efforts rarely are - that's why the term &quot;sophomore&quot; has such negative connotations.<br />But do not believe or buy into the people giving her one or zero star reviews.  These people believe they have the critical acumen to review her music, but all they really have is a petulant need to feel accepted and respected, which they feed by acting superior.<br />Fine, she's no Cassandra Wilson or Sarah Vaughn or whomever.  But for pete's sake, SHE'S A KID!  Give her some time to develop without expresing your insecurity by bashing her and her album.<br />The comparisons to Britney Spears et.al., don't make sense to me.  Just because she is young, we need to lump her in with hacks like Jessica Simpson?  Good lord.  Have IQ's fallen that far?  Of course she's not putting out crap like that.  She's a musician first, and a performer second.  <br />&quot;Feels Like Home&quot; may not be a classic, but it's a good little record that is at least pleasant background music for dinner or working or something mellow.  She's doing a fine job so far, and her voice and the sound of her piano are worth the price of the disc.  Don't listen to the nay-saying boors who've been slamming her.
B00008973Q|5.0|This film is undeniable the most notable adaptation of any work of William Shakespeare to the movie. The insights in every detail, the superb cast, the overwheelming photography, the camera's handle makes us inevitably to remind that happy sentence of Orson Welles who said once:<br />&quot;One film is really extraordinary , when the camera is an eye in the mind of a poet&quot;.<br />Casually this film is made in 1985, the same year of Welles'death.<br />Kurosawa was a truly master.

Just remember that Akira was the first filma maker who dared film against the sun in that glorius film Rashoman from 1950. His achievements all along his brilliant career are too many and certainly, would be beyond the reach of this shorts analysis.<br />This is one of these gems that you must see over and over, just when you admire this eternal masterpiece.<br />To be true the others Shakespeare's versions that deseve to be carried to the desert island would be in my opinion Titus 2000 (Julie Taymor), Othelo 1953 (Welles) , Richard III 1955 (Olivier), and Throne of blood 1957(Kurosawa).<br />But this movie is just several steps ahead all the titles above mentioned.be in my opinion Titus 2000 (Julie Taymor), Othelo 1953 (Welles) , Richard III 1955 (Olivier), and Throne of blood 1957(Kurosawa).<BR>But this movie is just several steps ahead all the titles above mentioned.
B000001G5L|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this recording.  No one can argue that this has to be one of the slowest versions of the Beethoven concerto currently available.  The question is, is this leaden tempo a good thing or not?<br /><br />On the one hand, the relaxed pace allows Mutter to linger over every note and phrase, bringing more nuance to the music than you could ever expect at a faster tempo.  After a few minutes of this, you find yourself thinking, \\"yeah, this tempo makes sense --- I can live with this.\\"  Then the orchestra enters, and you then realize what a horrible idea this tempo really is.<br />A horrible idea it is indeed, because the orchestra postively lumbers through the music like some large sweaty animal, and destroys all the good work by Mutter that precedes it.  It truly is a shame.<br /><br />Also, the quality of the recording reminds of when I go practice in the bathroom, just for the fun of it.  What is with all this echo?  It serves to distract more than anything else.<br />So who is to blame for this?  I wouldn't hold against Mutter.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, she was only a kid when she recorded this, and thankfully has rid herself over the years of Karajan's malevolent influence.  I have heard a couple of Mutter's live versions of the Beethoven, and the tempo is generally much more acceptable.<br />What we are left with is still more evidence that Karajan's repuation as a conductor is hugely overrated.  I simply do not understand how people continue to lionize Herbie when he regularly churned out recordings such as this that sound as though they were churned out by a giant musical robot.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't rate this lower is because despite the sluggishness of the orchestra, Mutter's performance is at times mesmerizing.  I can only thank God that she has continued to mature musically as an artist, and has made Herbie an increasingly distant memory.

Some people might think this album is gonna be soft because of &quot;My Band&quot; but it's not.  All rap fans should buy this album.  I mean come on, who doesn't like music from Shady/Aftermath.
B00004RF9B|5.0|4.5 stars. Nearly fifty years later it is truly amazing how fresh this movie still looks and feels.  I have always believed the primary component of any lasting film is a great story.  As a child I was as mesmerized by this film as much as I was with \\"Star Wars.\\"  The script is both highly intelligent and highly entertaining, with much more humor and believable horror than one would expect from a 1956 film.  The direction is polished and inventive, with arcing tracking shots and clever editing techniques strewn throughout the picture.  The acting here is very good, with a defining performance from Walter Pidgeon as Doctor Morbius, and a surprising dramatic turn from later-day comic actor Leslie Nielsen.  The supporting cast all shine, each one containing more depth of character than is normally given to secondary roles.  There is a tidy ending where a chain-reaction is started by merely turning a disc then throwing a switch, with irreversible effects.  A Master Race of beings create a machine 20-miles-squared that can be destroyed that easily?  Not likely.  Regardless, this is still one of the best Sci-fi films from the 1950s.  Thank you.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Now, this is what a movie should be. Thrilling action, good characters, great music; what a treat to finally see it after all these years. Too bad I was very busy running a small business during the 1970s, I would have liked to see it in a theatre.<br />But this is not a time for sadness, it's a time to celebrate the joy of seeing this rousing tale! I think the best thing about it is that it's about a shark. Sharks are very exciting, aren't they? Of course they are! So it only makes sense that a movie about sharks would be one of the greatest movies ever produced, and I don't say that lightly!<br />Men on the sea battling a fierce eating machine, oh what a thrill! I can't wait to see it again and I look forward to seeing more movies about sharks. I understand there's a sequel to this movie out there, well I promise you that it will be joining its brother on my shelf.<br />Evil it is that the highest rating that can placed on a product here is five stars. How I desire to give it six, seven, 10, 50! There aren't enough stars to give this film its due.

He has been saying moon since before he was a year, and still is obsessed with moons...in books, on clothes, in the sky...anywhere he sees the moon.  Now he can recognise and name all the objects in the book.  I would totally recommend this book for any baby...for some reason they just love it!

B0000025DT|5.0|This classic album yielded four American hits of which three (Living thing, Rockaria, Telephone line) were also UK top ten hits. The fourth, Do ya, did not chart in the UK and may or may not have been released as a UK single. Tightrope and So fine sound like they could have been singles but weren't.<br />ELO originally evolved from the British rock group, The Move, famous for such classic songs as Flowers in the rain and Blackberry way, but several line-up changes and a different musical direction gave them a completely different sound. At the time ELO recorded this album, the members were Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan, Hugh McDowell, Mik Kaminski, Melvin Gale, Richard Tandy and Kelly Groucutt.<br />This album, with its complex orchestral arrangements and any number of other instruments as well, is far removed from the fairly simple sixties music that The Move built their reputation on. Sometimes the album sounds as if it owes almost as much to classical music as it does to rock - this impression is reinforced by Rockaria, in which a couple spend an evening at the opera house and end up being entertained by an opera singer doing rock'n'roll music. Perhaps ELO were trying to do their bit to break down the barriers between different musical genres.<br />This is the first ELO album I ever bought and remains my favorite.
B000002GVO|5.0|One of the best albums ever recorded, and given the sales of &quot;Hotel California&quot; and the &quot;Eagles Greatest Hits&quot;, everyone knows it except the novices who would rate this classic with one star.<br />From &quot;Hotel California&quot; to &quot;The Last Resort&quot; a classic, &quot;must own&quot; piece of rock history!  5 stars, easily.

Madonna keeps fighting for our rights to express ourselves and is naturally the most significant female artist of all times pop music scenario.<BR>All tracks on this album are special gems but I would suggest &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; as the best dance song Ive heard in years although I love the James Bond theme, &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, and would also recommend that you see the original AMERICAN LIFE VIDEO ( a true piece of art!!!) and listen to the remixes of Hollywood on that maxi-single and the Nevins mixes on Nothing Fails on the Nothing fails maxi and on Remixed &amp; Revisited.
B00008J2DQ|2.0|When I first listened to this CD, I thought it was amazing; heavy songs, great solos, and even a ballad! Unfortunatly, after multiple listens, I realized that this isn't different than anything else they've done. Though I do think that this album contains some of the best solos that Tony has ever done (my favorite being on Re-Align, where he takes a change and doesn't use the wah-wah pedal at all), that's really the only thing that they have going for them. All the songs sound similar and the same old lyrics of &quot;I hate you&quot; and &quot;my life's f----ed up&quot; are present. What's more, they put all the songs with the solos at the beginning of the CD and there's really not that much the songs have to offer without them. The ballad, &quot;Serenity&quot;, although more melodic is really not that different sounding than &quot;Voodoo&quot; or &quot;Spiral&quot; from their first two CD's. Though I wouldn't recommend buying it or multiple listens, I would suggest borrowing it and listening to it once or twice as it is pretty cool for the first couple of listens.
B00005JMEW|4.0|It doesn't take long for the viewer to begin feeling sympathy for The Bride.  You know she was no saint before all this happened, but you overlook it.  You see her as she is in the present; you feel sorry for her and you cheer her on.  That's the mark of good writing.<br />The violence.  Well, this *is* a Tarantino flick.  Reservoir Dogs was a bloodbath.  Maybe that should be a primer before seeing Kill Bill Vol 1.  That said, the spurting blood was just hokey.  Too many times the story is detracted from because you're wondering what the special effects person and Tarantino were thinking when they did 'that.'  <br />There is also one scene where the violence just drags on.  Okay, we get it.  One person slays many - does it matter if many is dozens or scores?  That scene gets old fast.<br />Overall, this is an amazing movie.  The violence may not be entirely essential to the plot, but it is complementary.  The plot is remarkable.  The storytelling is engaging.  This movie is worth a view.  Just remember not to watch it in front of the kids.
0061015725|4.0|Whenever I fly, I try to get just 30-40 pages into a book beforehand. That's generally enough to know if the book will hold my interest while still leaving most of the book unread. If it's a flight of more than 10 hours, I'll usually even take 3-4 books along. Because there's nothing more disappointing that discovering that the book(s) you brought along aren't interesting enough to grab you and relieve you from the tedium of such a long and uncomfortable flight.    Prey is definitely the kind of book I could lose myself in on a long flight. And it has the additional advantage of being a book you can learn something from.    That said, I agree with another reviewer of this book who has observed that the quality of Crichton's writing is much lower in this book than in previous novels.    The science is quite interesting, although I have the sense that I missed a step between how the scientists are able to program simulations of how many small particles interact with each other and the actual creation of the particles themselves. They do discuss this process in the book, but it struck me as somewhat hard to believe.    Also, anything relating to personal relationships in the book comes across as very artificial. The protagonist hardly seems to know his own wife, and his relationship with his former co-workers seems likewise simplistic and unbelievable.    Still, it's a good read. If you can suspend your disbelief concerning a couple of minor issues, you'll enjoy it. It makes for quick and easy reading - just the thing to shorten a long trip.
0395177111|1.0|Ok so the world is a big place and it's full of strange people but I am surprised that anyone could be very impressed with the &quot;Leatherette&quot; editions of LOTR and The Hobbit. These particular editions are not ones I can imagine any discerning collector would want to own.<br />I bought the two books because I am not a fan of Alan Lee's work and I couldn't find any other current hardback editions that used Tolkien's original drawings, (as the &quot;Leatherette&quot; Hobbit does). The truth is though that these are the most tacky and tasteless editions I've seen and the print and paper quality of both books is very poor. The colouring of the drawings in The Hobbit is a disgrace and numerous pages in my copy of the LOTR were so smudged they were unreadable.<br />Don't buy them if you haven't already and if you've already made the mistake send them back with a complaint and write a scathing review to try and save someone else the trouble.
1573225517|5.0|The movie was set in Chicago or some large eastern city. John Cusack did a fabulous job capturing the sometimes obsessive, sometimes exasperated but always amusing main character. And the guys who played his store clerks were also fantastic.<br />Then, last summer, I discovered the book while staying in a rundown hostel in Camden, right where the book takes place. I had no idea the original was set in London, and it was fun to read it while wandering the very neighborhoods where it takes place. <br />For me, the different setting made it a lot of fun to read the book after seeing the movie. There were many similarities -- in fact, I could still picture John Cusack in my mind even though he's not British. And I could still picture the guys who played his clerks, too. But the different setting still contributed to my enjoyment of the book. (Although I often enjoy reading a book after having seen the movie, something which isn't always true the other way around.)
B00005JLSE|5.0|Finally the big budget movie of the stage show that will forever be popular. Richard, Renee, and Catherine really are singing and dancing out their parts.  This movie should have received more gongs that it did. Alas Hollywood has been pre-occupied by the LTOR trilogy.  The sound track is just as good.<br />I only wish the DVD had more information than it does but other than that, well done!
B00000272N|5.0|Facelift is not just a great 1st release, it is a great album. Period.  From \\"We Die Young\\" to \\"Real Thing\\" the album is a metal and grunge masterpiece.  As is typical with Alice in Chains, there NO are letdowns.  A few of my favorite tracks are \\"Bleed the Freak\\"(OUTSTANDING), \\"Real Thing\\", \\"Sunshine\\", and \\"I Can't Remember\\" not to mention the greatness of \\"Man in the Box\\"  Simply put, if Facelift kicks ass. Although their career wasn't as long as others, AIC is my favorite band and is especially underrated when compared to the other 3 major Seattle groups, each of which I am also a fan <BR>I must also recommend any of Alice in Chains later releases, including Sap and Jar of Flies.   For Jerry Cantrell to not be mentioned on Rolling Stone's \\"100 Greatest Guitarist list\\"  is blasphemy.  How Kurt Cobain can be named 12 and Cantrell not even on the \\"top 100\\" is BS.
B00005JLYW|4.0|The action three return for another round of fun and sillyness in Full Throttle.  However the return of the resculptured Demi Moore as the good former angle turned bad is what this movie will be remembered for.  Her high impact entrance in a Bikini is attested to this and she nearly upstages Diaz in the best body stakes. <BR>The DVD is packed full of information and all in all a great Chic action flick.
B00005JMKI|5.0|I've heard all that nonsense about this movie being \\"Anti-American\\". That is ridiculous. That opinion can only be held if a) you have not seen the movie, b) you did not understand it and/or c) you think that being uncritical and alienated equals patriotism. Von Trier's movies is an amazing display of film creating. With a minimal setting, he seeks to reconstruct a town in the middle of the repression. He has a critical agenda in regards to the United States: the town is portrayed as a double-faced, hypocritical group of people who decide to mistreat all the way to rape and slavery a newcomer that has nothing to offer them but love and mercy. This leads to a disturbing ending of the Von Trier brand. Von Trier's critique points to two directions: on the one hand, a denunciation (made explicit during the final credits) of a rich country that, regardless of its wealth, maintains enclaves of ignorance and poverty. The second is a reflection on the degradation of humanity and a reflection of how much should human beings be held accountable of their actions. And I don't think there is anything \\"anti-American\\" (which also I believe is nothing but an ignorant label that has been overused recently). There is the need on reflecting on ourselves and acknowledge the dark side of both our country and our humanity. Von Trier is ultimately a moralist of the most important kind: one that does not wave hypocritically any religious or humanistic ideals but that points us in the direction of the extreme of humanity. This movie shows the all too human nature of people: no one is good or bad regardless of their appearance. And this message is something we should read loud and clear, even if it is to dissent, instead of posing simplistic labels that, ultimately, do nothing but to betray the democratic role of culture as the consciousness of our dark side.
B00012QM8G|5.0|The life of war profiteer Osca Schindler during WW2 is played out, with a few inaccuracies, in this now epic movie.  Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley excell in their roles and Ralph Fiennes brings out his best acting skills playing a ruthless sadistical camp commandant.<BR>People who still deny the Holocoust really need to view this film.<BR>It is long but worth it, and surprisingly for such a dark movie, has small bits of humor just enough to get you through.
B00008NRI8|4.0|This movie is SO funny!   I am not a big Sandra Bullock fan, but nonetheless this was a great show (and if you like her a lot it's probably even better).   The writing is extremely funny and Hugh Grant gives his best performance to date.   Overall I would rank this as one of the best romantic comedies, right up there with Notting Hill and The Wedding Planner and just below the Princess Bride.  My husband liked it too!
B00005JMCN|4.0|An enjoyable movie based on fact. A not so well bred horse steals the hearts of Depression hit America by simply winning.<BR>The only doubt I have is that Phar Lap also had a similar life in Australasia and a movie made about that horse was a huge hit twenty years ago.<BR>A well presented DVD surprisingly filled with alot of information on the movie and the horse Seabiscuit.
B00006G8G1|5.0|I didn't buy this dvd right away. I don't know why. But I did buy it two days ago. I waited till 2 miniutes to midnight to watch it. Fiting, don't you think? Anyway, this concert was so massive, so crazy and so so so many crazy madien fans! I was just in awe of it. I loved hearing the massive roar from the crowd when madien took the stage. They way the sang along and jumped with the songs. They even moshed. I saw it. Even thought it was in the back. But, they caught it on film. I couldn't even imagine playing infront of that many people. I don't know how they did it. But they did and they did it the only way madien could do it. It was sick, sick, sick. I thought the sound and the camera work was outstanding. There was alot going on, but they captured it. This dvd deserves stars from here all the way to there! My only regret is I have yet to see them live in person. But, I will not give up!
B00000K19E|4.0|Keanu Reeves' now signiture role is introduced in this soon to be trilogy movie.  This was more acclaimed for it's special effects than confusing storyline.<BR>Still the DVD is full of information and had to be supplimented with The Matrix: Revisited, DVD in 2000.<BR>Now that the series is finished for now, a large box set containing all three movies and extra discs wouldn't go amiss.
B000002KHH|5.0|this has gotta be black sabbath's best album. it has some of their best songs on it. here's my opinion on each song<br />war pigs-awesome but a little long. the lyrics make sense to me<br />paranoid-great song<br />planet caravan-not a very good song but not horrible<br />iron man-best song on the whole cd. awesome<br />electric funeral-creepy but awesome<br />hand of doom-cool song better drum part<br />fairies wear boots-dont listen to it much. better than planet caravan<br />rat salad-cool with sweet drum solo<br />this is one of the best cds that i own
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Movie 2 of this highly confusing storyline begins to focus on the threatning Machine attack on Zion.  Once again Carrie-anne Moss' Trinity makes a high inpact entrance to start the movie.<BR>Keanu is still wooden but actually suits the part.<br />The highway chase scene is worth it's massive cost in construction and the CGI is terrific.  Absolutly packed full of information and worth it because the storyline is so confusing.
B0000026SF|2.0|For years I've heard about how great Europe's debut album was and how it's more metal, more progressive, more BETTER than their commercial breakthrough, The Final Countdown.  Plus, I'm a huge John Norum fan (about 5'10&quot;, 235 lbs.), so I couldn't wait to hear this thing (if I could only find it!).  After much searching over the years, I found a copy of Europe on CD.  I don't know if there are better versions (i.e. Remastered) of this album out there, but the copy I bought sounds terrible.  Very muddy mix with vocals way too high for a metal recording.  It has the feel of a demo, which is forgivable considering the era it was recorded and what must've been a limited budget for an up-and-coming band.  The part I can't get over is the inane lyrics.  The lyrics on this album make the songs from The Final Countdown seem like classic poetry in comparison:<br />&quot;There is no time to pay my sin<BR>and everywhere blows a firewind<BR>I'm all alone trying to survive<BR>It's coming back into my head<br />Memories of the time we had...&quot;<br />I'm sorry, but I really really wanted to like this album.  If it were 1982-'83 and I was a teenager again, maybe my opinion would be different.
B00006LIRI|4.0|While admittedly not a diehard fan of U2, I remember checking out my sister's U2 cds as a teen and I liked some of the songs. This is a good compilation of what I feel is their better more talented era, although I love &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; from the other &quot;best of&quot; U2 cd. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;
B00004TDTO|5.0|Here is Steven Spielberg's best film, not surprising since it is also one of his earliest, a movie that reflects not only commercial savvy but artistic passion and a true love for the moviemaking process. This is Spielberg displaying as much virtuosity as Quentin Tarantino would later show in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill.&quot;<br />&quot;Jaws&quot; is quite simply one of my favorite films, probably among the top 5. I just picked up a copy of the DVD and watched the movie again for the 40th or 50th time. It is staggering, the quality of this film. Spielberg's direction has done more than withstand the test of time; it shames the work by today's less-talented studio hacks like Stephen Sommers, Michael Bay, et al. Framing, pacing, camera placement, and every other tool in the director's toybox works to tell the story and give us information, not only about the shark's whereabouts, but the characters themselves.<br />The characters, and the actors who play them, are the real magic of &quot;Jaws.&quot; The shark is a wonderful special effect, to be sure, one of the most effective movie villains ever, but Brody, Quint and Hooper are the real stars. Their conflicted interrelationships hold the story together -- after all, there is a lot of screen time given over to the dialogue among these three men, when the shark isn't even a blip on the radar. Spielberg had a lot of faith in the ability of his actors to compete with the special effects, a faith he does not display today (&quot;A.I.,&quot; anyone?). This is just one reason why &quot;Jaws&quot; continues to work so well after 30 years.<br />A masterpiece of blood and guts (Quint's death scene is still hard to watch), &quot;Jaws&quot; is also underrated as a character piece. What a great movie this is.
B000001Y79|5.0|So many good songs on this one! Try tracks 1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 14. Whether they're doing punk or pop or jazz or whatever, No Doubt makes it sound good. Gwen Stefani gets compared to Madonna, which embarrasses her, but she's a cute little blonde chick with Italian roots, so how could we not picture her as a mini-Madonna after Don't Speak, even though some of us can't help but gag at the comparison LOL <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes
B0000057C5|5.0|I first came across the group Rammstein through one of their songs, &quot;Du Hast&quot;, which was packaged on another album. A search for the group and the song yielded &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;, the album. Now I am hooked.<br />Du hast, BTW, does not mean &quot;You hate&quot; in this context. It is part of the sentence, &quot;Du hast mich gefragt, und ich hab nichts gesagt&quot;, which translates, of course, to roughly &quot;You asked me, and I said nothing&quot;. It's part of the song's charm to build the phrase, word by word:<br />Du...Du hast...Du hast mich<BR>Du...Du hast...Du hast mich<BR>Du...Du hast...Du hast mich<BR>Du has mich gefragt, du hast mich gefragt, und ich hab nichts gesagt!<br />Go get this album, and then play it with lots of bass.
B000003TBP|4.0|Its pretty hilarious how Beck pulls off rap, or a sort of pseudo-rap. His early attempts at it in his early days, like in the Loser song, are hilarious, but you end up laughing but liking the song too. Well Odelay shows how Beck got better and better at his very diverse unique style of music.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|This film was a definately different twist to the gross out comedy genre.  I will give the film that, it is different, but comedies like these lack substance and are ultimately pointless.  Scary Movie was sick, and not entirely funny.  The script, the idea, and the concept were not worth putting on film.  It may have raked in some cash, but if the movie industry is not going to care about film quality and greatness, and only about money and box office revenue, the film industry may has well stop making movies all together.  Do not see this movie if you like films that are serious and potentially could be a classic.  I would reccomend this mmovie for any fan of gross out humor.  Trust me there is plenty of it in this film.
B000001DVV|4.0|If the opening song here &quot;Neighbor&quot; doesn't make you laugh, there's something wrong with you :). Ugly Kid Joe was a couple of skater surfer dudes whose songs were fashionably piled up with angst and cynical humor, grunge generation style. If you like good rock tunes, you gotta hear this album, at least 4 of the songs majorly kick ass. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|This album should`ev been good but it aint.BEFORE I START MY REVIEW --- the majority of ppl that are going to read this are those d&amp;ckheads who have reviewed this...so this will most likely get many negative results...but after u read this u will realise that anyone who rates this album a 5star hip hop classic one of the finest, is not a rap fan... ON TO THE REVIEW..........<br />if you think that this album is one of the finest in rap/hip-hop (if not the best) then dont call yourself a rap fan. this cd is not too bad, however, there are far better than the majority of u idiots havent heard of before, and your saying that this album is better. its similar to the last album.
B00006IX0R|5.0|This is a very good collection of the Cranberries hits and should-be hits. Basicaly, most of their best tunes. This Celtic folk-turned-rock band from Ireland has really impressed me for many years. I love Dolores' vocals. She's original and has a great sense of melody. I also like it when they give their stuff a slightly heavier edge. Some d*ckass reviewer once criticized Dolores when she sometimes sings in a low whispery voice like on the album &quot;No Need to Argue&quot; but I saw nothing wrong with her doing that. Whether it's high pitch loud or deeper and lower, her singing voice is niiiiice. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B000002LIR|5.0|I looked around in record stores to find a greatest hits album by Rod Stewart and could never find a one or two disc set that had all the songs I really wanted on it.  Finally I jumped on Amazon and found this outstanding four disc set that has everything any casual fan of Rod Stewart fan would want and then some.  And unlike many greatest hits CDs I've purchased, the sound quality is outstanding.<br />This is definitely a product well worth the price.
B000062YB1|5.0|Seasons In The Abyss, I think it cannot be doubted, is Slayer's most polished and talented piece of work. Here they reached their height of songwriting perfection from a technical level. Araya's vocals are at their best, King's guitar harmonies and riffs are amazing, and the lyrics are first-rate, better than lots of (...) that passes for poetry these days. Killer album!<br />David Rehak<BR>author of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\"
B00003CXCT|1.0|This has to be by far the worst decision ever made by a director concerning the dvd release of their film. How can George Lucas or anyone else  seriously think that the butchered \\"Special Edition\\" versions of these films are actual improvements on the originals? All the new scenes look like cartoons blended into real surroundings. The Jabba scene in A New Hope is especially horrific, it looks nothing like the disturbingly real Jabba from Return of the Jedi, who would have vaporized Han in an instant if he stepped on his tail. Also, the musical scene from Jabba's palace is now ruined, the creatures and the music were much better in the original. I think this is Lucas' way of getting revenge on the fans who hate his horrible new trilogy that is thankfully almost completed. What a way to thank your original fan base who provided you with the means to make a new trilogy in the first place. Thanks alot, George. Oh, by the way, I don't know what the people who actually like these Special Editions are on, but please don't give me any.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Courtney Love said in an interview she believed this album was a masterwork. That wasn't an empty boast, I believe she's right. These songs have great polish and technical maturity. Yes it's popy rock so some punk rockers will hate it. But I love punk and I love this album, so shoot me. &quot;Live Thru This&quot; was great too. As everyone knows, Courtney is the widow of deceased grunge god, Kurt Cobain. She and guitarist Eric Erlandson are the primary creative drive which has catupulted this group to the top of Stardom Mountain, if we can call fame a place. Hole has learned to walk that fine line between pop and rock called power pop, so they've adjusted themselves to mainstream popular taste, at least with this &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; album, much to the chagrin of more hardcore fans who preferred her ranting first album better. Courtney has a good voice, but she still doesn't feel comfprtable singing in a popy conventional way where vocal phrasing is concerned, but that's fine with me, I think it usually sounds effective. People who say she can't sing need to open their mind up a bit more. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B00005JMEW|1.0|When you boil it down, its just another Tarantino attempt to make up for lack of an interesting plot with a ton of violence.  There's not too much here, even if you can stomach it all.  Don't waste time or money on this one!
B00004ZB9D|4.0|I've been a fan of Kravitz since the early 90s when he broke big. His best tunes are really groovy and cool in a 1970's funky sort of way. This is one of my favorite of his albums.<br />Dvaid Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The problem with bands like The Strokes has always been their fans. No matter what they put out, they would have been accused of selling out or losing their edge--because once enough people start listening, something HAS to be wrong. In the case of Room on Fire, it's these same fans who give this album unfairly low ratings. Room on Fire is a far more cohesive and coherent effort than its predecessor. The level of musical communication between band members is far higher and far more nuanced. I'd also say the guitar parts are more creative than the incessant droning of Is This It? <br />If you're going to get one Strokes album, make it this one.
B000003TA9|4.0|One of the great neo-punk bands. But it's not just one-dimensional punk. These guys can do acoustic ballad, etc. Somebody told me they sound horrible &quot;live&quot;, but either way I think they're a really good band on record. This album is a good starting point.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B00008S2VG|5.0|I THINK AMERICAN LIFE IS A TRUE GEM. I REALLY LIKE THESE SONGS, MAYBE BECAUSE IM MORE INTO BALLADS WITH STRONG BEATS (like Secret, Ill Remember and Frozen) THAN INTO DANCEHALL ANTHEMS. SO THIS ALBUM IS FULL OF STRONG BALLADS AND ALSO DANCE TUNES FULL OF HIGH ENERGY - I THINK THE BEST CUT HERE IS DIE ANOTHER DAY BUT I ALSO LOVE AMERICAN LIFE - I CAN REALLY RELATE TO THE LYRICS, I REALLY THINK LIKE HER ON THAT THEME.<BR>And I love to dance to &quot;Hollywood&quot;
B0001JXQEM|5.0|This album, I don't know, it just reminds me of so much stuff about college life, the whole feel of it will remind you of when you were in high school or college. These are really great catchy alternative rock tunes too, now digitally remastered. My faves are &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; and &quot;Say It Ain't So.&quot; But itz all good, yo. :)<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I got this as a gift - i'm a fan of old school sci fi but the new stuff i occasionaly catch snatches of on sci-fi channel leave me cold. I saw the first episode and wow Im hooked. Im only sorry knowing that after im done with this four disc set thats it! no more! Is it true that there might be a movie - i hope so.  Great characters, a smart, witty script - in other words it gets all the basics right which most others don't going for the effects or action. Now there is plenty of action in this series so it satisfies at all levels. Highly reccomended and not just to fans of sci-fi.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This album is dope. I love the way \\"Super Fly\\" mocks this whole Eminem whiteboy honkie black-wannabe mentality. It's hilarious. But there are some other great tunes on here too. I like the old Offspring AND this newer [one]. I love the vocals, lotsa energy. I love it when a singer can holler and make it sound like music rather than just tuneless holler<br />David Rehak<BR>author of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\"
B000001C6M|2.0|the drum sounds is so thin , cant compare it to metallica  or  megadeth debut album which are much better<br />its not really brutal either compare to their later release<br />metal storm is best track on my opinion<br />this is shoulb be 3 or 4 star if better production
B000020617|4.0|Great tunes! Foo Fighters can produce radio-friendly songs like &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; that aren't garbage, and nothing wrong with that, says I. Let's not slam talent just cuz the alternative punk is a little popy, come on :). And somebody please shoot me for using all these &quot;genre&quot; words. Good music should just be called &quot;good music&quot;, period!<br />p.s. that breath mint video or the one for Learn to Fly are hilarious. I love it when a band has a sense of humor.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This actually a great movie and it doesen't shy away from the gore and blood like i thought from the trailer.  But this is an origional great movie, im looking forward to the sequal!
B0001LJCMK|5.0|This album is solid, from start to finish.  The more i listen to it, the more i wanna hear it again.  The sound is like a backwoods/voodoo type lyrics mixed with rock and roll, good riffs, simple, but really well timed effective solos. 0  If you appriciate good music, you'll be hooked on it.  The only way to hear it is to hear it loud.
B000000WA4|5.0|i love the smashing pumpkins they were and still are my most favorite band. and by the way this cd is all i can say is wow!
068484267X|5.0|I loved this book.  If you are interested in learning about poverty stricken cultures and how they survived than you will want to read this.  It gives a descriptive account of a child's life as he grows up in Ireland with many death's in his family and an alcoholic.  It is revolting the things children have to bear, and it gives the reader a hope and desire to help those in alike posistions.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I'm 18 years old, Im a big fan of hers... Once again, she brought us a great album.. Overall, its good but l think it really lacks \\"soulful\\" feeling: There are more synthetic sounds and less acoustic sounds (less guitar sounds, less organ and stuff..). In fact, I would even say it sounds like a neo-soul-pop album.. But still great though...<br />1.Harlem Nocturne-intro- Good intro, once again showing us her piano playing skills. A little upbeat, so it wakes you up and get you ready for more. 5/5<BR>2-Karma- Yeah yeah, a really catchy song, but l don't like it though.. The lyrics are good but the musical production is still to \\"poppy\\" to my ears (too much synthetisers and computers!!). Quite good upbeat song with trumpets like a military march... 4/5<br />3-Heartburn- Oh yeah, l wish l could burn the dancefloor with it.. Reminds me of those  soundtracks from Blaxploitation movies, back in the 70s.. good beat, trumpets, wah wah guitar (aah!!). Original work by Timbaland... Even though alicia seems to strain her voice on this one... Heartbuuurn!!! 4.5/5<br />4-Walk On By/If I Was Your Woman- Well, between upbeat and midtempo song... its really great, with only a piano a moog bass and drums.. Sounds a little like a gospel song, but really good. Good vocals, with emotions... Good to chill out with... 5/5<br />5-You Don't Know My Name- 1st single...This one sounds simply PERFECT.. Good midtempo, with violins (typical 70s atmosphere).. The lyrics are a little cheesy and that phone interlude its so long it starts getting boring.. But the beauty of the song shadows all that... 4.5/5<br />6-If I Aint Got You- 2nd single... Aaah, much more better, reminds me of a typical \\"Songs In A Minor\\"'s tracks... There are only few instruments, so that you can hear the beauty and the emotion in her voice.. real Good song... i love the part just before the chorus. Great ballad.... 5/5<br />7-The Diary (ft. Toni Tony tone)- Don't know why so many people hate this song. Its a great one, really cool and Tony Toni Tone singing background vocals, and the piano riff.. Good slowtempo. You should listen to it with a drink, chilling out, thinkin bout ya love.. 5/5<br />8-Dragon Days- Nah nah nah.. im not feelin this one. Sounds like she's moaning on it... The beat is quite good, but l dont love the way she sings on it... from moaning to grave voices... Nah. Definitly nah. not-that-good midtempo 3/5<br />9-Wake up- Uh uh, quite good ballad. Sounds more like a pop ballad from the 80s than a soul one... But still good.I like it but not my fave... 4/5<br />10-So Simple- Andre Harris' sound (Try \\"Butterflies\\" from Jackson's \\"Invincible\\" or \\"lullaby\\" on M Carey's \\"Charmbracelet\\").. I like the way she managed to make it ssounds like a sampled song (with the vynil's sound).. The second high-pitched voice is quite funny, but it really works... Good midtempo song 5/5<br />11-When You Really Love Lomeone- Thats what l was talkin about.. Its like putting \\"A Woman's Worth\\" and \\"fallin\\" together.. Great emotional moment. With the choird and all of that... this is a great great ballad, with great vocals (Showing her quite-high vocal range) 6/5<br />12-Feelin U Feelin Me- Interlude. Sounds like a Marvin Gaye work with sexy voices in the background and an electric piano and a burnin guitar.. mmh!! Good slow instrumental.. 4/5<br />13-Slow Down- Hmm.. Sista AK get nasty nasty with that sexy song.. But that's all. Its quite boring and a little poppy. Midtempo song.. 3.5/5<br />14- Samsonite man- Pfff... No comment. 2/5<br />15-Nobody Not Really- Good song to end the album. Kind of laid back vocals on it. Good work. Naw Im waitin for another AK dish... She's really talented (britney and jessica where are you??), she really deserves her success, even though l know a lotta people wanna see her failing. Nah, hold on Sista Alicia... Just one question: What was she thinkin when she decided to sing that \\"Gangsta lovin\\" song with Eve?? Boring!!
0553801546|4.0|The first half of this concluding book is wonderful... it stands alone and with the entire series.  That last half (after the  motley crew lands at the icy kingdom of the dragon) feels perfunctory -- as if Hobb wanted to finish the story but knew she needed to put her readers through their paces to do it.<br />This should NOT discourage anyone from reading this book!  Good heavens... if you have slogged through Fitz's suffering and triumphs the least you can do for yourself is read this book to achieve closure.  And it is very much like a funeral ... at the end the reader feels like she is saying goodbye to an old friend who, in the last 30 pages of his story, achieved some sort of contentment.

0061015725|4.0|I've only read one of Crichton's other books (The Andromeda Strain) so I'm not sure how this compares to his overall work, but I really enjoyed this book.  I found it to be a good thriller that had enough &quot;creepiness&quot; to have me thinking about it when I went to bed that night.  I read this book in 2 days - it is a page turner and keeps you interested.<br />Some have said that Crichton does more character development in this one, and I have to agree.  The main character is really developed and you get a great picture of his mindset and overall point of view.  <br />Great twists and turns, great story and great action.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars (I reserve 5 stars for definite, cannot miss, must-read books that are perfect in almost every way), and wholeheartedly recommend it.  I've been on a reading kick lately, and have read TAS by Crichton, Deception Point and Angels and Demons by Dan Brown, and would recommend this one as being as good as, if not slightly better, than these other titles (although all are worth picking up).
1592400876|4.0|Churchill's description of the Brits and Americans permeates this terrific little book. <BR>Many great anecdotes illustrate important punctuation issues; <BR>however, we need an American version or we're doomed to more confusion. <BR>How about a second edition?
0060920084|5.0|Bryson hilariously captures the unique combination of delight, embarrassment, and boredom that only a drive across the United States can bring.  Anyone who has taken the cross-country drive with the family will recognize the America Bryson captures so well.  For every toxic passage that leads the reader to question whether Bryson is a misanthrope (e.g., his numerous descriptions of obese, tacky American tourists), there's a passage of pure delight, such as Bryson's description of the squares in downtown Savannah, Georgia.  Despite any clear plot other than to keep moving and see everything, Bryson through his wit and insight compels the reader to join him on this journey.  <br />It's an understatement to call Bryson funny -- several passages had me laughing out loud.  This is the first of Bryson's works that I've read, and I'm looking forward to diving into the rest of them.
0679731369|5.0|I hated this book passionately for the first 50 pages because plot was nowhere to be seen. Then I fell in love with it. Remembrance of Things Past -- the concise edition?<BR>That's what I would call it. Great book.
0385486804|5.0|The quick pace, interesting story and talented writing-style all made it difficult to put this book down. I've read three of Krakauer's books and enjoyed them all immensely. <BR>I'm not sure what to think of Chris MacCandless and his deadly adventure; my opinions changed frequently while reading about his life. While opinions as to why he chose such a secretive and lonely journey could be debated forever, it was the emotional torture that his parents and family endured that really tugged at my feelings. No matter what his motivation to go alone into the wild (and I do believe some mental instability played into it), there was no excuse not to contact family in even some tiny way. As we can tell from his letters, he had no problem sending communications to even the most casual of acquaintances he met along the road. <BR>We have decided to make this the first book reviewed in a book club that some friends and I have started. I can't wait to hear the ideas and opinions of others. I know there will be much heated debate.
B00008S2VG|4.0|With the help of music critics around the world, this album did not perform to the ability of all other Madonna albums.  Her tenth album came out with no controversy but hate among the critics. What did she do to them?  Well, she released her most important, narcisistic, and darkest album yet.  Yes, the album is no &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; or &quot;Ray of Light&quot; but it's not &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;, &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; or &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; either.  <BR>The first track was the first single, &quot;American Life&quot;.  The song is not her worst(Hanky Panky)???, but one of her most unpleasant tracks.  The problem? The rap, but at least she didn't have four million people guest starring on this track, she did the rap herself.  The acoustic guitar parts, the sound of bombs at the end of the track and her vocal performance give light to her anti-war song.  At least she had the balls...now release the video!<BR>&quot;Hollywood&quot; is a combination of New Order meets the Beatles.  This should have been the lead single, and when it was released as a single the video killed this song.  Overall, a great track but overshadowed due to her kiss with Britney and Christina.  Entertainment at it's best!<BR>Listening to Madonna's early demos shines a light on the rock track &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot;.  Guitars, distortion, a clever use of words in the chorus, a stand-out track.  Hopefully, she will experience more rock on her next studio album.  Deborah Harry would die for a song like this.<BR>Most notable is the dance track &quot;Love Profusion&quot;, a blend of new wave, acoustic guitar and an unbelievable vocal interpretation helps this song to be one of the best on this album and her catalog.  If you aren't dancing with yourself at the end of this track, please go to your local club and get grooving!  Check out the remixes, they do rock!!!<BR>Madonna's use of her influences is highly evident with the techno driven track, &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;,  her homage to Kraftwerk and former lablemates Yazz and Depeche Mode.  This proves Madonna can write an honest to goodness club track.<BR>Ballads have always been in Madonna repitore and &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; fits comfortably next to &quot;Crazy for You&quot; and &quot;You'll See&quot; as being a triumph gem in her catalog.  The gospel chorus and her commitment to her husband makes you believe that love will conquer all.  The only confusing thing is that no video was released with this single which is just as annoying as &quot;Into the Groove&quot; never being released as a single???  <BR>The best track on American Life is the wonderful &quot;Intervention&quot;.  Following the leaders like the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Love.  This song is a true testament to our social times, love will prevail not ignorance.  Her hidden lost album track just like &quot;Gone&quot;, &quot;Mer Girl&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot;. Excellent!<BR>It seems like Mrs. Ritchie picked up some Nick Drake albums while recording this album, the evidence &quot;X-Static Process&quot; an ode to her husband but also could be interpretated in discussing her conflict with god and maybe her father.  Trying to get attention is a trait amongst us who have lost their mother.<BR>With her studio albums Madonna's confessions of being a motherless daughter constantly appears in her work, &quot;Promise to Try&quot;, &quot;Oh Father&quot;, &quot;Inside of Me&quot;, and mentioned before &quot;Mer Girl&quot; and now the dance infused &quot;Mother and Father&quot; a song that could have been on her debut album released twenty plus years ago.  Only one who has lost a parent understands her message in this standout track.  Following your heart is just as important as remembering the memories...<BR>The most confusing inclusion on the album is her smash hit single theme to the last James Bond movie &quot;Die Another Day&quot;.  The song has loops of techno flash, whirlwind strings and charming lyrics, the problem?  She should have used this on the next remix album...a great break dancing song though.<BR>Madonna often ends her studio albums with melancoly choices, &quot;Gone&quot; from Music, &quot;Take a Bow&quot; from Bedtime Stories, and &quot;Mer Girl&quot; from Ray of Light.  The dramatic &quot;Easy Ride&quot; explains the heartship, the struggle, the hate, the love and the depression of being the most famous woman in the world.  In the end, we learn that her family is more important than album sales, she's sold over 250 million albums, what does she have to prove?  Her happiness...which is evident to this American Classic...
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is by far, the best movie ever.  I was so moved not only because of the fact that the plot is wonderful, but because it was like looking me in a mirror...  One tells stories to amused people and sometimes they don't like them, or don't enjoy them but in a way, that stories are building up memories that will never be forgotten.  Is kind of making history on a life of someone else.  You will be hardly being forgotten.
B0000257O9|5.0|I bought this album upon its release, and accidently left it at a friend's house for a couple weeks.As he fell in love with it, I couldn't wait to get it back and hear myself! Wow! I had never heard anything quite like it! I soon joined the military service, and for handling simplicity I bought a copy on cassette. Played it do death, shared with friends.. wore it out. Bought a second one, which lasted a little longer. Finally, the compact disc was issued, and yes, i have one, and i play it alot!I wish these guys would produce more albums/projects. (Yes, i have &quot;Adventures In modern Recording&quot;, and Geoff Downes' experimental &quot;symphonies&quot; on vinyl...) This album influenced me to check out Yellow Magic Orchestra, Bill Nelson's red noise, and Depeche Mode.
B000148KK2|4.0|Maybe it's not fair to compare Costello/Krall with all the songwriters of the classic songs on her previous records, but they are simply not playing in the same league. However, this record still (of course) has Diana's voice all over the place which makes this record worth buying, even if I think her voice is better suited for jazz standards than Costello-pop. If you're looking for classic jazz-standard songs, get some of her other records. When you've got them all, then get this.<br />If you are a fan of Costello, this is something for you too, the songs where he has made a contribution are instantly recognizable. Anyhow, it IS nice to see that she did choose to make something slightly different than before!

B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I must admit I was one of those individuals that was caught up in the hype of \\"Is This It\\" when it first came out. My anticipation for \\"Room on Fire\\" was at an all time high. When I first heard the new disc, I felt a bit let down. I think the constant listening to the previous cd had somewhat spoiled me. <br />Artist at times try to expand or move away from their previous material. We don't want that with the Strokes. We want them to rock in their own way. With a critical ear I listened to each track over and over again and must admit, after a few plays, the cd began to grow on me. \\"What Ever Happened?\\" and \\"Reptilia\\" are solid standouts, as are \\"Under Control\\", \\"12:51\\" and \\"The End Has No End.\\" I think the difference between the two cd's is that while \\"Is This It\\" had no weak tracks, except maybe for \\"When It Started\\", this cd finds me skipping more tracks and just listening to those that I enjoy, which is still the majority of the album. <br />If you didn't like the Strokes before, this record will not sway you in their favor. And if you loved them as I do, this cd is a solid follow up. As fans, we can tend to be a bit more forgiving on artists that we enjoy. I do know that given the amount of pressure that they were under to produce a solid follow-up, Casablancas and company do deliver on this record. I must also say that all songs on the new album do sound very good live, as I had the opportunity to catch them in concert last October. For those that signed the Strokes death warrant or gave them 1 to 2 years to wither away into oblivion based on \\"Is This It\\" and the hype, keep the predictions coming, because these guys aren't going anywhere anytime soon.
B000002KHH|5.0|I bought this album when I was 11 (back in 1975)-- it was the first rock album I ever bought and probably resulted in me being a bit twisted during my formative years.<BR>Anyway - classic Tony Iommi/Ozzy tunes like Paranoid and Iron Man, plus many great, lesser known tunes like the eery Electric Funeral and bizarre classic Fairies Wear Boots.  Not sure that it quite holds up after all these years, but it shows where AC/DC, Priest and others got their inspiration.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I watched the first episode on Fox...I hated this show.  Then the brilliance of the setting and characters quickly won me over.

0062502182|5.0|A friend recommended that I read THE ALCHEMIST by<br />Paulo Coelho, and I'm glad that I took her advice . . . this is<br />an enchanting fable about Santiago, a shepherd boy who follows his<br />dream in search of buried treasurer . . . along the way, he<br />encounters Gypsies, a king, a merchant, an Englishman, and<br />an alchemist . . . when he meets Fatima, he also discovers<br />love.<br />This book got me thinking about the journey of my life . . . while<br />not quite the same as Santiago's, it nevertheless has been filled<br />with both ups and downs that have certainly led to an<br />exciting venture--thus far . . . as to where it will eventually take<br />me, I'm still wondering . . . and hoping that if I listen to my<br />heart (as recommended by the author, a Brazilian storyteller),<br />methinks I will never be bored.<br />There were several memorable passages; among them:<br />Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset:<br />he was trying to tell him not to trust that man. &quot;I'm like everyone<br />else--I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen,<br />not what actually does.&quot;<br />But the sheep had taught him something even more important: that<br />there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a language<br />the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve<br />things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things<br />accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for<br />something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a strange<br />city, and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could<br />conquer the world.<br />&quot;Don't say anything,&quot; Fatima interrupted. &quot;One is loved because<br />one is loved.

6305280762|5.0|More than 10 years ago, Roger Ebert and the late Gene Siskel did a special edition of their program that examined &quot;The Early '70s: The Last Golden Age of American Film.&quot; It was a great show, with a look at each nominee for the Best Picture Oscar for the years 1970-1974, and then which film Siskel and Ebert would have chosen as the winner. <br />When the duo got to 1974, and a split screen revealed the five Best Picture nominees for that year, Ebert expressed some amusement at &quot;The Towering Inferno's&quot; nomination, when compared with the others (&quot;Chinatown,&quot; &quot;The Conversation,&quot; &quot;Lenny&quot; and the winner, &quot;The Godfather Part II.&quot;). But while it was not the best film in a truly great year for the medium, &quot;Inferno&quot; did deserve to be considered one of the best.<br />This is polished, professional filmmaking. It was not intended to be a scathing expose of construction politics, or an actor's showcase. &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; never tries to be anything more than an action spectacular, pure and simple, and on that level, it has few equals.<br />The film has been criticized for being almost gleeful in its depiction of various deaths, but I'm not sure what those critics would have had directors John Guillermin and Irwin Allen do. The story is about a giant skyscraper on fire, which means that the primary dangers involved are burning, falling, smoke inhalation and being buried under tons of debris. All of these are horrific, and &quot;Inferno&quot; conveys that horror.<br />The movie takes on a different hue than the Irwin Allen film it's inevitably compared to, &quot;The Poseidon Adventure,&quot; the minute Steve McQueen arrives at the scene as  the San Francisco Fire Dept.'s battalion chief, O'Hallorhan. Unlike &quot;Poseidon,&quot; in which a small band of ship passengers follows a layman toward safety, the &quot;Inferno&quot; disaster is going to be taken on by a competent, experienced professional,leading other professionals. McQueen conveys an authority that anchors the film.<br />None of the acting struck me as truly bad, even in action-oriented scenes that called for broad playing. Aside from McQueen, my favorite performances were those of Susan Flannery and Jennifer Jones. Flannery makes the most of a small but memorable part as Robert Wagner's love interest, while Jones, looking very good for a woman of 55, plays the kind, heroic love of Fred Astaire's con man character. <br />Fred Koenekamp's cinematography received a well-deserved Academy Award, as did L.B. Abbott's special effects. The song &quot;We May Never Love Like This Again,&quot; sung by Maureen McGovern, also won an Oscar, though I found it to be forgettable. &quot;The Poseidon Adventure's&quot; similar &quot;The Morning After&quot; is much better (which will certainly be faint praise to some).<br />John Williams' Oscar-nominated score would have been a perfectly reasonable choice as the winner, though Jerry Goldsmith's evocation of film noir classics for &quot;Chinatown&quot; was probably the year's best. Carmine Coppola and Nino Rota wound up winning for &quot;The Godfather Part II.&quot;<br />Williams is in majestic form here. The main title is appropriately busy and exciting, the love themes for the Paul Newman/Faye Dunaway and Astaire/Jones duos are poignant, and the finale is one of the masterpieces of the art. This is a justifiably a favorite score among film music buffs, and Williams' greatest triumph, in my opinion, until &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 1977.<br />&quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; is a must for action film fans, and the finest representation of the &quot;disaster film&quot; genre.
B000089RVX|5.0|imma rap fan to the fullest but this is a great cd
B000002LHX|3.0|This is the soundtrack for the first (modern) [[ASIN:B000B5XOY8 Batman film]], and it is entirely by Prince.  Most of the songs here don't actually appear in the movie, but that seems to be a fairly common occurrence nowadays.  The songs are actually sung from the point of view of characters in the movie.  This is not Prince at his best, but it is still pretty good, considering it's the soundtrack to a superhero movie.  There were three hit songs from this soundtrack, but none of them were included in Prince's [[ASIN:B000002MNF \\"Hits\\"]] collection.  I think that says something.
6304071868|4.0|This film was made in 1977 about an actual srategic operation mounted in Europe in 1944.  It was planned by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, the British commander who was well-known for his competition with (and dislike of) the American General George S. Patton, who is not represented in the film.<br /><br />Montgomery is the bloke who got credit for pushing Rommel's Afrika Korps out of the Sahara, and for trying (unsuccessfully) to beat Patton across Sicily.<br /><br />Like many top commanders, he was extremely egotistical, but short on aggression, as Patton demonstrated, and in this case his &quot;Operation Market Garden&quot; turned out to be a hairbrained disaster and blood bath: the Aircraft and gliders missed many of their drop zones and failed to drop vehicles and armament as planned (gliders were a disaster on D-Day, too, and they should have known).  Eisenhower, being more politician than general, and trying to placate the Brits, let Monty talk him into the disastrous plan.) In the story, at least, one of the top British commanders refused to accept photographic evidence that German &quot;Tiger&quot; tanks from an SS Panzer division near Ramaden (one of their targets, which was supposed to be a &quot;cakewalk&quot;) because he didn't want the operation to be delayed, which resulted in many unnecessary deaths.  At the end of the movie, he said, &quot;Well, as you know, I always thought we were trying to go a bridge too far.&quot; Hence the title. The man he addressed, played by Connery, should have shot him on the spot. The route chosen for the main body of troops who were to support the<br />airborne units was too narrow, incapable of carrying the required traffic, and resulted in the operation taking over a week, instead of the planned two days.  Then, there were the inadequate boats for crossing the Rhine.  The operation was mounted in only seven days, as opposed to several months for D-Day, which accounted, perhaps, for the numerous foul-ups. That, and the unmitigated arrogance of the planners!<br /><br />In short, Monty's plan was hairbrained and poorly thought out, but he claimed afterward that it was &quot;Ninety percent successful.&quot;  That was Sir Bernard Montgomery!<br /><br />This movie was well-acted with many top name actors, all of whom did justice to their parts: Sean Connery, Dirk Bogarde, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, Laurance Olivier, and Robert Redford, to name only a few.  The film itself seemed to be well researched, and quite realistic foe that era.<br /><br />One of the better World War II films,  I recommend it for those of that endangered species, the WWII generation--those of us who are left--and will most appreeciate it.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other booksat, and the unmitigated arrogance of the planners!<br /><br />In short, Monty's plan was hairbrained and poorly thought out, but he claimed afterward that it was &quot;Ninety percent successful.&quot;  That was Sir Bernard Montgomery!<br /><br />This movie was well-acted with many top name actors, all of whom did justice to their parts: Sean Connery, Dirk Bogarde, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, Laurance Olivier, and Robert Redford, to name only a few.

B0001Z53AQ|4.0|I'm a huge Eminem/D-12 fan.  I thought their first CD, Devil's Night was bad ass.  So of course I went and bought their new cd as soon as it came out today.  I have to say that I'm pretty happy with the results.  I think the best tracks are &quot;get my gun&quot;, and &quot;40 oz&quot;----They have sweet beats, and are almost the pumped up type of songs like Eminem's &quot;lose yourself&quot;.  If I had to compare both cd's that D-12 came out with, I would probably give the edge to Devil's night, but I still think this is a great sophy album.

I've heard this band on the radio and so far Stockholm Syndrome, Hysteria, Time is Running out and Blackout are my favorites. This CD rocks and would recommend it.
0201485672|5.0|This remarkable book is the next logical step after 'Design Patterns'. In fact, it would be fair to call this 'Re-Design Patterns'.<br />It follows closely in the DP community's habit. For each way of improving a program, it systematically presents a name, set of conditions when it does or does not apply, and (unlike most DP books) clear, demonstrative examples and variations. As with design patterns, many of these recommendations have a sense about them of &quot;I already knew that.&quot; That's a good thing - it means you bring familiarity to the reading, instead of starting cold. That lets Fowler get on with his real business, which is to systematize the knowledge and regularize the process of choosing a technique to use.<br />I hope this follows another habit of the DP community, too: the public cataloging, collecting, and sharing of new techniques for refactoring. I could add bunches to the list, as I'm sure any other seasoned programmer could. One thing is distinctive about the refactorings: the number that come in matched, opposite pairs. This just emphasizes the context dependency of refactoring - each technique has its place, but is not appropriate in all places. Also, paired opposites effectively double the number of choices a practitioner has.<br />Design patterns are very helpful, almost like power tools for programmers. Face it, though: initial design and implementation are only 1-10% of a large program's life. Maintenance, extension, and re-design are the other 90-99%. DP techniques get a program started, refactorings keep it going.<br />If you started programming before most of your co-workers were born, you may not get the most out of this book. Get it anyway, and make sure the young pups read it. This knowledge needs to be spread.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|I NEVER, EVER in my whole life felt moved to write to a record company thanking them for the time and effort it took to pull a fabulous collection together for our entertainment's sake. But when I purchased my Nuggets box set in 1999, I was compelled to do just that. Five years later, I still can't find the words to adequately sum up my love of this set. I had already been familiar with alot of the songs thanks to Rhino's Nuggets album series of the '80's, and the fact that I'm the 9th of 11 kids. See, back in the mid sixties, I had older brothers and sisters who were buying records and going to dances on Saturday nights. My oldest brother had a set of drums in the Attic where I used to practice \\"Little Girl\\" by Syndicate of Sound while the rest of the kids were at school. (I was 4 at the time) But I knew some of these songs because of the way they used to sell records in the 60's. You could buy a bundle of 10 cut-out 45's wrapped in cellophane at the local 5 & 10 for a dollar. You could only see the labels of the records on each end which meant that eight of them were pot luck. This is how my older siblings would buy them, and we had TONS of them!        This set reminded me of EXACTLY how it was to buy based on only what you know and take a chance on the rest. And just like then, the investment paid off IN SPADES! This collection defies description. It's fantastic, stupendous, awesome, phenomenal and so much more! I'll NEVER tire of this set! I hope it stays in print forever!
B00003CXB4|4.0|The good news about The Lion King DVD is that it is the BEST DARN DISNEY MOVIE EVER MADE and it's getting the royal DVD treatment I've dreamed of.<br />Now here's my never ending string of bad news: the DVD is ripping off the film's most beloved fans such as myself.<br />1. THERE IS NO ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSION!  The OTV is actually the reanimated version done for Imax release (the Morning Report was only made for the dvd release)  So technically there is no version that you saw in the theaters back in 1994 of the VHS you bought in 1995.  This has got to be the worst cheat that the Disney Company has ever placed upon its consumers and I regret not writing an angry letter (I hope you all did).  I saw the Imax version and the reanimated sequences were done very poorly.  I doubt that with the exception of the dust incident that none of the errors from the original LK were fixed<br />2. FEATURES ARE POOR!  I definitely say this regarding the deleted scenes.  There are only 3 and all of them star Timon and Pumbaa (pushing the release of LK 1.5 a bit?)  I was very disappointed that they didn't have the good deleted version of &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot;.  Honestly I'm sick of Timon and Pumbaa, though I did like the Lion King 1.5  If you go to [...] you will find tons more deleted scenes then what this dvd rip off provided<BR>There are too many things for kids, and a stupid music video plus the organization of Disc 2 is done very poorly.  I think they should've done something better than a round the world thing (if you go outside of Africa or North America you'll only get slideshows of posters in different languages)  There are no original theatrical previews of the film either.  I heard some good thing about a making of special that appeared on the LK Laser Disc but not on the DVD  Then you get some stupid stuff about African animals that I wouldn't care less about.  there needs to be more stuff for fans and less stuff for kids.<br />3. THE MORNING REPORT- Well this number was very very unneccessary compared to BatB's Human Again.  It was never even a originally deleted sequence but the animation got in smoothly.  The bad news is that Simba has no whiskers throughout the number and it's too obvious.  If they did not add Simba's whiskers in the new sequence on purpose then I need to go find these animators and knock some sense into them!<br />4. Menu - DEAR GOD WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!  A CGI ZAZU!  AND NOT EVEN A GOOD ONE!  And a poorly done 2D drawn background!  Does Disney really hate 2D that much?!!!<br />You know who's to blame for all of this his name is Michael Eisner!!!  And until we get him out of Disney there's no hope for the future Plantinum Editions of Disney films.  These people cant make up their minds on whether to call these Special Editions or Plantinum Editions.  It sounds as though Plantinum Editions sound better but you only get Special Edition like stuff with a Plantinum Edition fear.<br />For the sake of being a true Lion King fan I got the Collector's Gift Set.  WARNING: MY GIFT SET CAME THROUGH AMAZON AND GOT DAMAGED UPON SHIPPING.  IF THIS HAPPENS TO YOU THROW THE BIGGEST FIT AND GET YOUR MONEY BACK!!!  I regretted not doing this cuz I wanted to see the new dvd.  However I didn't know that stores like Best Buy were carrying the Gift Set for much cheaper than I paid here.<br />So here's my advice for people getting the Aladdin Collecters Gift Set in October: DO NOT PREORDER HERE!  Check with Best Buy or other good stores and they might have it available for $5-10 less than you would pay here and you wont have to pay for shipping that might damage your precious gift set.  Dont make the same mistakes I did!
0803723865|5.0|Wonderful story of an imaginative mouse who while taking a walk through the woods makes up a story about a animal he calls a Gruffalo , he makes up this animal to protect himself from the various predators (fox, owl, snake ) that want to eat him .He succeeds in frightening away the animals ,but than he meets the animal of his imagination a Gruffalo. Now he has a bigger problem the Gruffalo wants to eat him, so he tells the Gruffalo to walk behind him through the wooods and see how afraid the animals are of him (the mouse that is ). The Gruffalo of course doesn't believe that the animals could possibly be afraid of a mouse so he walks behind the mouse , and when the animals of the woods see the Gruffalo behind the mouse they runaway in fright and the Gruffalo believes that the mouse was telling the truth and runs away from the mouse himself. Very enjoyable for both parent and child. Wonderfully illustrated, I highly recommend the Gruffalo
B00008S2VG|5.0|I MUST SAY IM MORE IN LOVE WITH THIS DISC THAN I WAS WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT. THE MORE I LISTEN TO IT THE MORE I SEE IT AS HER BEST WORK TO DATE OR ATLEAST A CLOSE SECOND TO LIKE A PRAYER. THERE IS SOMETHING VERY MOVING AND INTIMATE ABOUT THE CD. ITS NICE TO SEE, IN MY OPINION, HER GROW INTO THIS HAPPY LOVE BITTEN AND REFLECTING WOMAN. SHE CANT WRITE SILLY POP SONGS FOREVER ATLEAST NOT AN ENTIRE ALBUMS WORTH.

0312263120|1.0|yeah, i live and breath the techie lifestyle, and this book was really bad about its facts in that regaurd.  Looking past that, I'm not gonna judge him on this one, cuz from what I've seen, he wrote this book before the others.  maybe the innacuracies in this book is what inspired his fact checking in the DVC and A&amp;D?
6305252521|5.0|This movie is a great movie and is the second best Carrey movie behind Dumb and Dumber but this is still quite a great album the story is that he is being recorded 24 hours a day on live TV and he lives in a different world and all the people on this place are all actors and all them.Then he found out what happened and was going to get on of it on live TV.Some brilliant serious acting by Jim Carrey strongly recommended<BR>Acting 10 Story 10 Direction 10 Action 9 Entertainment 10<BR>Overall=49/50 wich is 5 stars also recomended if you like this<BR>Forest Gump and Cast Away also both classic movies.
B000002LEE|5.0|Before alternative was the norm, there was a little band called Jane's Addiction. They had a loyal following, but were not by any means the in music of their day. I've heard Jane's compared to several bands. Some mention Zeppelin. You can definitely hear Zeppelin's influence in the guitar work at times, but not so much in the vocals. I've also heard some mention the Chili Peppers, but I don't hear that at all. All I can gather is that this idea came about because Dave Navarro was the Chili Pepper's guitarest on their underappreciated One Hot Minute, although even on that album there's little similarity to what you'd hear from Jane's. I guess it doesn't really matter who you compare them to, this is a band that can really rock. This album contains &quot;Jane Says&quot; which is one of the band's best known songs, but also many other gems. In their first few albums, Jane's Addiction had a tendency to really get experimental. Sometimes it pays off, other times it doesn't, but it always makes for interesting listening. Still, some people may never be able to get into a song like &quot;Ted Just Admit It&quot; no matter how hard they try. Others will find it an odd work of genius in it's own way. This album was released in 1989, but sounds nothing like the music of that era. This band has always had a style of their own that transcends what you'd expect from a certain time period of music. They always just sound like Jane's Addiction, and nothing else.
B000021XS0|5.0|The whole concept about this album is very interesting. The opener takes you in a new world where everything seems to be just perfect! Very slow, awesome vocals, it's like James Labrie manages to hypnotize you or something. <br />Then it kicks in \\"Overture 1928\\", this song shows how talented the band really is, everything single note is at its place! Dream Theater knows what they're doing, they didn't take all those music classes for nothing eh?<br />Now comes \\"Strange Deja Vu\\", this song is full of surprises, it's like you never know what's gonna happen! Very brilliant! The way it slows down for the chorus. Gotta love it!<br />\\"Through my Words\\" is an intro for \\"Fatal Tragedy\\", again you can hear a lot of progessive elements. A great song if you ask me! Great keyboard / Guitar combos!<br />\\"Beyond This Life\\" is an 11 mins song, this one starts kinda fast, and then gets a bit slower for a couple of mins(but not boring!), and then speeds up again! Well done!<br />Time for the first slow song \\"Through Her Eyes\\", Well let's say that this one still managed to impress me. Great song if you want something to relax!<br />Time for one of the best song on the album, \\"Home\\", WOW! This one is kinda influenced by Egyptian music or something. Starts kinda slow and confusing, and then out of nowhere you start hearing Petrucci's guitar, simply amazing! I'd recommend you listen to this song first, if you wanna hear what they're capable of!<br />\\"Dance of Eternity\\" is an instrumental song, it shows how great these musicians really are. They know how to play their stuff trust me!<br />Time for the 2nd slower song \\"One Last Time\\", this one is a bit faster than the first one though, Well done here again! And I might sound weird but do you guys think that the little song at the end of this one looks like a song they would play in a horror movie?<br />\\"Spirit Carries On\\". WOW! Very impressive! Slow and Easy! Petrucci even adds more fun to it with a nice solo! You gotta hear this one!<br/>\\"Finally Free\\" is another classic from this band, it ends the whole story perfectly, Mid Temp song at its best!<br />All the songs on this album are simply amazing, this has to be one of the best metal release ever!
B00009W0U4|5.0|The film is brilliant, Noe is brilliant, the actors are brilliant. This movie really does touch every one of your senses. It is definatly not a movie for the faint of heart and definatly not a movie to watch with the 'fam. If you appreciate good movies you should get it. Let me stress again that this film is brilliant, but do be prepared because you are in for a grotesque hour of film.
014118213X|5.0|None of the characters is perfect, but you can't dislike any of them. I have read this book many times - I studied it at school, which has coloured all subsequet readings. Every time I gasp at what I missed all those years ago. Our teacher skated right over the philosophy and feminism and fashionable ideas about economics and so on that are the backbone of the book. However we studied closely the book's texture and atmosphere: the English countryside, London's railway stations, Christmas crowds in Oxford street on a winter's afternoon. We even (convent school girls as we were) understood more about the difficult \\"facts of life\\" portrayed than the references to Nietzsche.<BR>I used to see it as a black and white morality. The Schlegels were spiritual, artistic and nature-loving. The Wilcoxes were obtuse, money-grubbing and morally dishonest - and upheld the British empire, something else our teacher never mentioned. Somewhere around the 25th reading I realised that the Schlegels weren't particularly clever (apart perhaps from Tibby, but his learning and intelligence are presented as sterile), and none of them is creative. Their discussions about politics with their arty friends are quite ineffective. No wonder, perhaps, that confronted by Leonard they see an opportunity to actually DO something at last. <BR>Eventually, though, Margaret finds she has a job - as Henry's wife. She succeeds not by her attempts to change him, or her direct and clumsy attempts to get him to see the consequences of his actions, but by her warmth, gentleness, sympathy and affection: qualities the first Mrs Wilcox also had in spades.<BR>Henry may represent Colonialism and Patriarchy, but he's also a human being and we can see why she is attracted to him.<BR>The end of the story is left rather in confusion: after minutely detailing where everybody spent the night and how they got there, after the inquest this is left blank. Did Margaret and Helen stay on at Howards End (presumably required tostay in England as witnesses in Charles's trial)? Did Henry eventually join them there?<BR>Like the best books, you want to know what happened to the characters next. Edward Petherbridge's audio version is wonderful, but he brings out the poetry rather than the comedy. As a completist I may have to listen to Emma Thompson's...<BR>If you liked this book, try J B Priestley's Angel Pavement. For background (and the lowdown on Nietzsche) read John Carey's The Intellectuals and the Masses.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I'M CRAZY FOR ELECTRO!!!<br />I love Felix da Housecat, Miss Kittin, Fischerspooner, Kylie's &quot;Fever&quot; but... AMERICAN LIFE IS SOOO MUCH BETTER. Madonna really impressed me with this release. 100000000 stars from the star who shines brighter than all the rest ;-D
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Will the suits who run network tv ever learn?  I personally hope that the dimwits at Fox who made the decision to cancel Firefly end up banging their heads against the wall---as the folks who made the decision to cancel Startrek undoubtedly did once they saw the commercial success of the Trek movies.  But what can one expect from a network who hypes such rot as &quot;The Littlest Groom&quot; and &quot;Joe Millionaire Pt. 2&quot;.  It's too bad that Fox which established itself with risky shows such as &quot;Married with Children&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (yes my children, it was risky once), and &quot;X-Files&quot; didn't give &quot;Firefly&quot; the same chance that it is giving &quot;Tru Calling&quot; or &quot;Arrested Development&quot;.  It's too bad Joss Whedon didn't stick with WB or shop the show to one of the cable networks.  Firefly might have had a chance.<br />Enough said about Fox.  Now for the praise of the show.  I did watch while the show was on---despite not knowing from week to week if the show would be pre-empted, and I thought the show was very good indeed.  In fact the only bad thing I can say about the show is that it should not have been in an early night time-slot.  The content and violence don't make it a suitable show for young kids, but that was Fox's mistake not the show's.  Like other reviewers, I saw the parallels between westerns and the original Star Trek.  Like another reviewer I too saw a similarity between James Garner's &quot;Support Your Local ...&quot; movies and Nathan Fillon's performance. Although these likenesses are all good things, they are not the only reasons I like Firefly. First, this show had a first rate and somewhat seasoned cast who were able to convey all that the writers wanted them to and then some.  Second, Whedon and Co. once again delivered the tight storytelling they are known for and combined them with the elements of adventure, honor, horror, romance, angst, and humor to make an entertaining show. There is much more I could say about this show. The writers and the actors respected the intelligence of the viewers.  I also enjoyed the caliber of guest stars and I certainly enjoyed such recurring characters as the wily Saffron or the evil Niska.  I liked the camera work and effects.  Much about this sci-fi show seemed natural rather than gimmicky special effects. Finally, unlike many shows which follow a formula, Firefly left me wanting more...to learn the mysteries behind each of the characters and to see what unfolded next for the Firefly crew.
B000005J08|5.0|I've got about 30 Zorn CDs, and this is one of my favorites. It's not easy listening by any means--there's a lot of punk screaming noise, but unlike other Zorn albums of that genre, the punk bits only last a few seconds apiece. Naked City is like no other album--genres mix from great jazz to country to rock to punk and back again within the course of a few bars. Truly amazing musicianship, and some songs you just gotta play over and over. Regardless of which 'side' of Zorn appeals to you, unless you're straight ahead jazz, this is a must-have.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I must give it 5 starts. Since I love both experimental and pop music, although some people think they can't be combined successfully, this album is just perfect for me. I've been a Madonna fan for the last decade which I think was her best carrer half...<br />I think the only mistake of her last years was the duet with britney but it's not included here anyway.<br />American Life 10/10<br />Hollywood 10/10<br />I'm So Stupid 8/10<br />Love Profusion 100/10 (lol)<br />Nobody Knows Me 100/10 (lol)<br />Nothing Fails 100/10 (lol)<br />Intervention 10/10 (beautiful!!!)<br />X-Static Process 9/10<br />Die Another Day 100/10<br />Easy Ride 100/10
B00004U8H4|4.0|I thought this was a great movie. It has dark comedy in it, but it is mainly a horror movie. I thought Christian Bale did a superb job as Patrick Bateman. The movie was directed by Mary Herron, and was done really well. The cast includes Christian Bale, Jared Leto, Chloë Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, and Willem Dafoe.<br />'American Psycho' is about a rich businessman Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who, during the day anyway is a charming guy, but sometimes he just wants to kill whenever he feels the urge.<br />DVD Features include Production notes, Theatrical Trailers, Making of 'American Psycho', and a Christian Bale interview. Overall this DVD is worth every penny you pay for it.
B000002BFZ|3.0|I've been a fan of this band since day one, and though I enjoy this album, I don't find it as pleasing as &quot;Vs.&quot;, &quot;Yield&quot;, or &quot;Riot Act&quot;. This is very similar to &quot;Vitalogy&quot; in my opinion, in that it is good, and very diverse, but just doesn't impress front to back like others do. However, I love the songs &quot;Who You Are&quot;, &quot;Off He Goes&quot;, &quot;Red Mosquito&quot;, and even &quot;Mankind&quot;. The others are decent, just not stand-outs. Overall a fine album, but not essential &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;.
6305313687|5.0|Tony Kaye disowns this masterpiece, he should never be allowed to direct again. Okay this is well documented about the director's unorthodox antics, with the studio.In my opinion he walked away from a daring film, not seen since the likes of 'A Clockwork Orange'. He is not Stanley Kubrick or Terrance Malik on the perfection stakes. He just has a major ego and is a pretenious exhibitionist.<BR>Aside all of this and Edward Norton's alleged post production tinkering. This is one of those rare films shock and compell you<BR>at the same time.
B000000OPZ|4.0|This may not be their best album, but it's easily their most popular. The casual fan will find their biggest hits on here. This was released in 1987, and includes &quot;Still Of The Night&quot;, &quot;Is This Love&quot;, and the huge hit &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;. However most of the other tracks are nearly as good. &quot;Crying In The Rain&quot; and &quot;Children Of The Night&quot; are two other favorites. Overall they were one of the better hard rock/metal bands of the era, and had great taste in hood-ornaments too. Also better than &quot;Great White&quot;, and &quot;White Lion&quot;.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|The new D12 CD is very good.  I recommend this CD to anyone who has the previous one.  I've been waiting for it to come out, and am very pleased with it.  FYI the 4th song is pretty gross, but very funny.  So if you have virgin ears, you prolly ought to stay away from this one.   You could always buy the edited version, but they prolly don't make one, seeing how the whole CD would be just music and nothing but bleeps.  HAHA<br />D12 Rocks the HOuse
B0000C7PSW|2.0|As much as Rufus Wainwright protests on his debut CD that he \\"ain't a soft and saccharine wannabe,\\" evidence is mounting to the contrary.  I've liked his past CD's, but everything about \\"Want One\\" leaves me cold.  An overproduced, pop explosion of orchestra, horns, bells and whistles seems only a cover-up for the rather uninspired melodies and lyrics underneath.  With corny lyrics as those in the introductory \\"What a World,\\" (\\"Wouldn't it be a lovely headline: \\"Life is Beautiful\\" on the New York Times\\") or just plain ridiculous on \\"Natasha\\" (\\"You walk alone in the valley of life In the shadow of love Under the trees of happiness\\"), one has to ask: Is this guy for real?  The melodies here are rather weak, and those that are good are lost in the albums bombastic production.  \\"I Don't Know What It Is\\" has a good beat and feels like a ending-movie-credits theme, but has been injected with too much SIZE.  The CD's quieter moments prove to be the strongest; \\"Pretty Things,\\" despite its shallow lyrics, burns with Wainwright's slurred baritone, \\"Harvester of Hearts\\" captures a more smoky, piano bar vibe, and \\"Dinner At Eight\\" pairs a good composition with heart-felt lyrics.  Unfortunately, even these songs are complicated by multitracks that only seem to obscure them.  The only place that the album's overall sound and sentiment really comes off genuinely is \\"14th Street,\\" with its bar-room bop and Billy Joel-esque piano rock providing a vehicle for one of the better lyrics on the CD.<BR>I was incredibly disapointed in \\"Want One,\\" since Poses showed Rufus pumping out great songs that were both romantic and a little sleazy at the same time: it showed real growth for him as a songwriter as well.  This feels like a step backward.  I guess the CD's coda, \\"Want,\\" says it all: \\"I just want to make it simple.\\"  The unintended irony here (and the only one that isn't oh-so precious) for an album so convoluted speaks volumes.<br />**Update: 5/11/04**<BR> I decided to give this CD another listen in response the barrage of favorable reviews and negative votes this review is accruing.  Sadly, I must reinforce my previous conclusion.  The lyrics are the worst kind of sentimental kitch, and the music is far too clever clever: where's the passion, the fire?  I hope that part II of \\"Want\\" shows a little more daring and a little less \\"I wish I was Gershwin on an overdose of nutmeg.\\"
B00005JMEW|1.0|I loved Pulp Fiction and his other movies with violence, but this one was just ridiculous!  NO plot, just some violent, but not particlarly great fight scenes. And after you've been dieing of boredom (or revultion) for two hours, they sneak in a bit of plot at the end so that you have to see part 2.  Tarantino said he made one film, but it was too long, so he cut it in half, but you still pay the price for a whole movie.  Entirely not worth it!  Don't waste your money on this or on part 2.  Part 2 had some plot, but it also had some horribly disturbing scenes (like live burial).  If you want a kung fu movie, buy one instead of this trash.
B0001Z363W|5.0|I'm a new fan of the Black Label Society, so far, I've only listened to Sonic Brew, Stronger Than Death, and Hangover Music. I've noticed that some people might complain about it not being as hard as Zakk's other stuff, but so what? Being able to do different things shows that you're talented. Zakk shows his talent with the solos that he has, and the lyrics are just great. This CD was well worth the money I paid for it.
B000062XM7|5.0|I saw this movie in my history class (yes, it's true, we watch R-rated movies in high school nowadays) and I was absolutely amazed.  Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible as Hawkeye for several reasons.  First of all, he is one of the few men on earth who looks good with long hair.  Looks aside, his acting is outstanding and he looks at his love interest with such passion.  The cinematography is good, the soundtrack is haunting and evocative, and the rest of the cast is superb.  Madeleine Stowe plays Cora Munro, and she is excellent in her role.  Her onscreen sister, Alice Munro, is played by Jodhi May.  When Alice pauses before she jumps off a cliff (after her dead lover) her calm, peaceful look into the camera gave me the chills.  It was actually suspenseful.  &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is a movie that will stick with you long after you finish watching it.  I definitely recommend this to everyone.
B000002UAI|5.0|If you look at the cuts on this CD, you find 7 versions of some of their favorite artists (i.e., the ones they were brought up on, loved and respected, learned from and were formed by): Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, and Carl Perkins were high on the Beatles' list of respected songwriters, and the Beatles' versions of their songs reflect a feeling and appreciation for them.  Getting back to their roots, they even chose Kansas City, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, and I'm a Loser to perform on TV (Shindig).  Listen to the spirit they put into Kansas City and Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey; it's rousing.  The harmonies and the varied rhythmic schemes of almost all of the other cuts give a good sampling and helping of some of the richness the Beatles were/are known for.  This CD is a pleasure to listen to, and is well worth investing in.
B00005Y7L4|5.0|This movie is definitely one of my top ten movies of all time.  Unfortunately, a movie like this would never be allowed in American Theatres.  In Japan, this is shown on daytime television, which I think just rocks.   I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action/horror movies.  The only reason I say horror, is because some people find it very disgusting, where I personally find it amazing and cool and somethings wish I was on the island with 43 people I hate.  I, especially love the character of &quot;Kiriyama&quot; - he was the one who volunteered for this game.  I love how at the end after the fire he is blind and their are single blood lined tears on his face.  Amazing.  He reminds me a lot of Sephiroth in Final Fantasy 7, especially in that one scene with the fire.  Maybe that is just me, but I loved this movie.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.
B0001LJCPC|3.0|ok, the soundtrack is great, but there are two important peices of music that are missing. The Scenes with Budd outside of his trailer, and the end when Bill is killed. Those are my two favorites from the movie, and they are not on here!!! <br />But I do love the peice of music &quot;L'Arena&quot;...when the Bride is punching her way through the coffin. It gives you such a sense of victory.<BR>The picture of Quentin and Uma on the back of the CD is really sweet too.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Some may claim this album is the unofficial soudtrack to Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, others may put it on repeat and watch the History Channel on mute. However you view this album, its mastery is blindingly apparent.<BR>Following the 1995 guitar-driven &quot;The Bends&quot; was no small feat for the group, a process that inextricably led the band to explore and grow musically. The album's title offers a slight allure to the futuristic tone of some of the instrumentation, while the guitars are still present at all the crucial points.<BR>The album starts off with &quot;Airbag&quot;, the strongest piece in Thom Yorke's 'autophobia' (cf. &quot;Killer Cars&quot;, &quot;Stupid Car&quot; b-sides). The commotion, aggressive guitar riff, the oddly welcome jingling bells in the background, all feed into the urgency and significance of &quot;In an interstellar burst / I am back to save the universe.&quot; &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; is one of the band's better-known songs, particularly for its insanity. The instantly recognizable riff changing guitars, frantic responses, the famous &quot;Rain Down&quot; section, Thom coining 'Gucci little piggy', and utter defiance towards convention, expectation, and fashionable society. &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;, clearly a nod to Bob Dylan, offers another Thom-and-Jonny project that sounds futuristic and other-worldly. The narrative is excellent and isolating at the same time.<BR>&quot;Exit Music (for a film)&quot; is Radiohead at its best. Thom's removed near-whimper over an unassuming acoustic guitar progression draws you in, deeper and deeper, until the explosion of defiance and hatred with Colin's fuzzy bass lines and the distant high-pitched soloing. This song corresponds to the final exchange between Romeo and Juliet, all the way down to the outro fade and the final words - &quot;We hope that you choke.&quot; Priceless.<BR>&quot;Let Down&quot; is one of my favorites, especially as it is never played live. The precision and ingenuity of producer Nigel Godrich leaves his fingerprints all over this track, citing alienation and a need for escape. The track swells with dreams of hope and escape, pleading &quot;Some day, I am going to grow wings / A chemical reation / Hysterical and useless / Let down and hanging around...&quot;<BR>&quot;Karma Police&quot; is also extremely well-known for its vibrantly colorful lyrics and piano introduction. You begin to side with them, in &quot;This is what you get / when you mess with us&quot;. The repetition of &quot;For a minute there / I lost myself&quot; into what sounds like computers exploding comprises an amazing depiction of personal meltdown. &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; features a computer's voice reciting almost formulaic means to happiness, as random instruments fill the background and almost overtake the system, &quot;like a pig / in a cage / on antibiotics.&quot;<BR>&quot;Electioneering&quot; is a surprisingly attainable song with an eccentric riff and the tongue-in-cheek chorus &quot;I move forwards / you go backwards / Somewhere we will meet&quot; describing the political process of campaigning and garnering support. This song foreshadows the group's proficiency in writing political satire.<BR>&quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot; is simply creepy and fantastic. The bass is unbelievable, the mental imagery is David Lynch-ian, and the overwhelming solo at the sing's middle is worth the price of the disc alone.<BR>&quot;No Surprises&quot; is another well-known piece, featuring a xylophone and a simplicity overshadowed by the complexity of the other tracks. &quot;Lucky&quot; has been called the 'James Bond' song for its lofty overtures and the invincibility of the character, with the chorus asking &quot;Pull me out of the aircrash / pull me out of the lake / 'Cause I'm your superhero / We are standing on the end...&quot; Finally, &quot;The Tourist&quot; breaks typical meter and takes its time, reinforcing Thom's hatred of lightning-speed tourists(in their native Oxfordshire?) with the beckoning &quot;Hey man / Slow down...&quot;, a plead that alone has garnered many fans to appreciate this album.<br />But all these songs together, on one album? It is almost incomprehensible how one group could be so talented to assemble such an ambitious and individual piece as OK Computer is. Simply put, this album put Radiohead at the forefront of the world's musical talent, a perch they have yet to cast any doubt upon.
B0001I55OC|1.0|Director Richard Donner clearly cut his losses by doing very little in the way of post-production for this film. The sound effects and visual effects are virtually non-existant. During filming, Donner realized he had a turkey when Paul Walker delivered a vacuum-head performance along with the other jokers that dared to call themselves a cast. What an insult. And a ripoff.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Add mine to the chorus of praises to this album, though I can't even think of a way to describe it in any way that would do it justice.  Lead singer Wayne Coyne writes very simple lyrics, though quite profound, and Steven Drozd's instrumentation, coupled with Dave Fridmann's production, is psychedically frenetic in one instant and lushly beautiful the next.  Sometimes the whole production is a bit overwhelming, but amazingly it all works and every song fits together with the whole.<br />This album deals, in a truly empathetic fashion, with deep thoughts and feelings we've all had at one time or another on our journeys through life--including fear, sorrow, and regret--but every song is tinged with a sincere optimism that only Coyne's earnest vocals can provide.  I can't recommend this album highly enough.  It's made me think about a lot of things in life differently.
B000002KD5|5.0|Fleetwood Mac (possibly taken from the names of two of it's founding members, drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie) started out as a psychedelic/blues band in the late-'60s. Things began to change for the band, as co-founding members Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer slowly began to lose ground to drug abuse and mental illness. Come some years later, Lindsey Buckingham was asked to join the band on guitar, but Lindsey said he would join the band only under the condition that they would accept Stevie Nicks in as well, since Lindsey and Stevie were a \\"duo\\" act (which never went anywhere) and something of a couple. With this, the new -- and more commercially successful -- Fleetwood Mac was born.<br /><br />Fleetwood Mac's self-titled 1975 release is loaded wih tracks exhibiting the somewhat slick, but tasteful, emotive pop rock that the Mac would eventually become famous with. Lindsey's tasteful, country-tinged guitar licks, Christine McVie's sensual, husky vocals, and Stevie Nicks' mystical, introspective leanings are all noticeable here. These three are the dominating songwriters and personalities of the band, but that's not to say that Mick Fleetwood and John McVie aren't worth mentioning: Fleetwood's drumming is simple for the most part, but just as tasteful and enjoyable, and McVie provides impressive and tasteful backing basslines, which are readily noticeable.<br /><br />\\"Monday Morning\\" is catchy, melodic and infectious, regardless of the slick production. Lindsey's vocals and guitar playing here are highly enjoyable. The vocal harmonies are great too. \\"Warm Ways\\" is a sensual, seductive, silky-smooth romantic ballad written and sung by keyboardist Christine McVie. Romantic souls (like myself) will eat this sweet thing up. \\"Blue Letter\\" is a short, fast-paced country-tinged rocker sung by Lindsey. Catchy, hummable verses give way to the infectious \\"I ain't waitin'\\" close-out. Next up is Stevie's \\"Rhiannon,\\" which became a hit for the band. Christine McVie dazzles and seduces again with \\"Over My Head,\\" a subtly wispy number with McVie's emotive lyrical and vocal delivery. In regards to the ladies of the band, I find Christine McVie's songs -- and vocals -- to be more seductive and enjoyable than Stevie Nicks' on the whole, if anyone reading this review hasn't figured that out by now. This isn't to shortchange Stevie Nicks' contributions at all, as I enjoy those too. Speaking of Stevie, she writes the next song \\"Crystal,\\" which is a slow-groover with an airy atmosphere.<br /><br />Next, it's Christine McVie again, with the charming, romantic, and hummable \\"Say You Love Me.\\" This one can be heard on radio stations, even today. Stevie Nicks' shining moment on this disc is \\"Landslide,\\" an introspective number featuring arpeggios from Lindsey Buckingham, which paint something of a somber, reflective atmosphere to match that of the song's nature. The Christine McVie/Buckingham-written \\"World Turning\\" bears a slight resemblance to disco, but not too much as to ruin your appetite (assuming the majority of reviewers/Mac fans who read this review are as put off by most disco as I am.) Christine McVie charms once again with \\"Sugar Daddy,\\" but this one isn't as charming as the other McVie numbers that appeared earlier on the disc. The closing track, \\"I'm So Afraid\\" (written and sung by Buckingham) is a minor-key, melancholic number with a haunting, semi-chilling atmosphere brought on by the minor chords that dominate the track. The lyrics are quite melancholic and pained as well. The solo near the end of the track can be described as devastating.<br /><br />Things would get a bit heavier in atmosphere next time around on 1977's _Rumours_, due to the drama surrounding the band, but this drama helped to inspire what would become Fleetwood Mac's biggest album. While things weren't too heavy during this release, the album still came out excellent. Make sure you pick up both for some tasteful, moving, sensuous (and sometimes fun) popmusic.
B0001GL3K4|2.0|First, let me say that I am a big fan of British movies and especially a big fan of Colin Firth. Therefore, I rushed to see the movie. What a disappointment! It seems to be very diluted, like a series of storylines that are best dealt with in a soap opera. What were they thinking, these capable actors? Each role is barely sketched and stereotypical. I am really sad to write this review, since I know it is going to impact their viewership, but I felt so betrayed in my affections, that I had to say it.

All in all the selection is A+, and the flow of the cd as well.   Great vocals from a man with a unique voice and equally great music from his talanted band mates!!!!!

B0001611DI|5.0|Silly me.  I rushed out to buy this movie because a) I love Dawn, and b) it's been criminally out of print on DVD for years, and the older sets sell for a lot of $ on ebay.  However, Anchor Bay has announced that they're selling a deluxe version of the film in late 2004, so looks like I'll have to buy it...again.<br />The next version will likely be a double disc set with two different cuts of the film.  Dawn exists in several different cuts, and the names are not helpful.  The actual 'Director's Cut' is not George Romero's definitive version of the film.  The version Romero considers his 'director's cut' is the American Theatrical version.  I believe the Director's Cut is similar to the cut that Dario Argento prepared for the European release, and is titled 'Zombie' for the continent (which is why Fulci's unofficial 'prequel' is called 'Zombie 2'.)  There is also a German cut of the film that is the longest (over 140 minutes, I believe) and is commonly sold on ebay.  I'm sure various bits and pieces were cut depending on where it was released (for instance, in the past the UK version omitted an exploding head and a couple of flesh-tearing close-ups.)<br />The version on this disc is only slighly different than the VHS of the American Theatrical version I have.  This version omits part of the scene on the police dock between Steven and Fran and the cops who are running.  It doesn't really matter though, the film is not upset by this change.  The blood and gore is fully intact here, though.  This DVD looks and sounds amazing--this is the best looking Dawn I've ever seen.  The colors are brighter, the print is cleaner, it's top notch.<br />There is now a commentary track by no less than four people including Romero, his wife, and Tom Savini.  Then there's a 'moderator', which is laughable, to be honest.  I don't really like 'moderators' for this type of thing, and the guy is totally unnecessary.  You can tell he's fawning over Romero, and sometimes he tries to get in his canned questions (as if reading from a pad) while the rest of the crew are yukking it up, recalling the making of the film.  I would rather hear honest, straightforward commentary than some pining stooge sucking up to Romero and Savini, but hey, this is better than nothing.<br />There are also trailers, TV spots, and other goodies on this disc.  All in all, a very welcome package by Anchor Bay, a company dedicated to horror fans, it would seem.  However, for the Dawn addict, I would say wait until late '04 to buy the deluxe edition, guaranteed to have more good stuff (check out Anchor Bay's web page.)<br />As for the film, I won't say much, except that it's probably one of the best horror films ever, at least American horror films.  The theme is basically timeless, though the 2004 remake was quite good and turned the story into an action film, which worked well.  The film has some shortcomings, sure (acting at times, effects), but the overall atmosphere is very strong, and the bright, comic-book look is perfect.  This is a highly recommended film, and a great DVD.n his canned questions (as if reading from a pad) while the rest of the crew are yukking it up, recalling the making of the film.

B00007BH5C|5.0|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers soundtrack is 1) an excellent score cd 2) a worthy companion to its predecessor the Academy Award winning The Fellowship of the Ring. Howard Shore returns to write the music for the next chapter of Jackson's films. The Two Towers has a mixture of new and old themes. Enya, a fixture on the Fellowship soundtrack is not featured on the Two Towers soundtrack. The Fellowship theme, the Isengard theme, the Rivendell theme, the Mordor theme, and the Shire theme all make reappearances, but added amongst them and comprising most of the cd are new themes. The Rohan theme is a very Vikingish theme replete with strings and percussion.  Shore has the ability to vary the mood of this theme, usin it at the triumph of Theoden's reawakening as well as at the defeat of the evacuation of Meduseld. Treebeard's theme, is a very soft kind of &quot;forresty&quot; music with a chorus to give it a mysterious air.  Shore uses heavy percussion to make the theme more effective.  Arwen's theme is different from the first soundtrack, first because there is no Enya and second because its more of a melancholy love theme. Gollum's theme also doubles as the Ring theme from the first film, but the way Shore plays this theme reflects the 2 sides of Gollum's personality. As in the Fellowship, Shore uses different choirs very effectively, giving the elves an ethereal sounding choir, etc. The only complaint I have about the Two Towers soundtrack is the last track &quot;Gollum's Song&quot; sung by Emiliana Torrini. I found this song to be out of character with the rest of the cd and didn't much care for it. Unlike Enya's &quot;May It Be&quot; from the Fellowship soundtrack, &quot;Gollum's Song&quot; employ's no elvish and really just sounds creepy. Fitting for Gollum and it fits perfectly in with the movie although listening to it alone takes some getttin used to. However, it does not detract at all from the listening experience. The Two Towers is an excellent cd, andwhile it does not surpass the Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack it is its equal.
B000002JSN|5.0|easily the greatest led zeppelin album. probably one of the greatest albums of all time. this album left all previous LZ albums \\"trampled under foot\\", if you will, and this album was an extremely hard act for Led Zeppelin to follow. this albm proves that Bonham and Jones were probably the greatest rythm section of all time. if led zeppelin had some other drummer that wasn't bonham, they would suck. try to imagine \\"Kashmir\\" without Jones keyboards. if \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" were on this album, it would probably crumble to dust. it's their heaviest, awesomest effort. it's worth or disc one alone. disc 2 is cool cause of Ten Years Gone, The Wanton Song, and Sick Again. In The Light is also pretty awesome, but it seems like Kashmir pt. 2 to me. although jones gets to rock the keyboards on this one, kashmir is just heavier, thus it's better. the rest of it is just interesting outtakes which are weak when they're next to such epic, rocking tracks.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Before The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, I never paid much attention to Howard Shore, but after I heard his excellent score, I started to get more music composed by him, yet none of his other work compares to his Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  The Fellowship was the first of the Trilogy and as such, Shore established his themes for the landbreaking film. The music revolves around five basic themes: The theme for Isengard, the theme for the Black Riders/Mordor, the theme for the Fellowship, the theme for the Ring and the theme for The Shire. The range of music is extremely wide. The Black Rider theme is a very dark, gothic theme, while the Hobbit theme is very light and playful reminiscent of an old countryside folktune. The theme for Isengard is very strident percussion and brass with emphasize the evil building under Orthanc. The Fellowship theme is a very bold theme, only heard in its full glory 2 times on the soundtrack on tracks 11 and 13. The hints of most of these themes play in almost all the tracks of the film, however all of these tracks stand alone. For example Amon Hen track 16 is one of my favorite tracks, because it provides a visual picture of what is happenning on the movie screen. Choir is used effectively to heighten the emotion of any particular track. The cd is over 70 minutes long, and I wish it could be longer simply because the music is so enjoyable. Shore's score to this epic film belongs on the top ten score's of all time and it truly deserved the Academy Award that it won. It is simply magnificent!  Also used excellently is the solo voice of Enya.  Her haunting melodies in the final track of the cd as well as track 10 create a moving visual picture of the film.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|As i listen to the CD now many things come to mind. It captures the essence of the film...no it is the essence of the film. We all know that the trilogy is undescribable, but this CD brings it all together. Never before have i flat out cried in my car listening to a CD, today though was that day. I have listened to many a soundtrack and classical music, but Howard Shore's work, along with many others, is aweinspiring.<br />  The films themselves take us on a journey of epic proportions, i have even found myself drained like i too was on the journey. The music though brings the soul to each piece and captures our utter love for the films and pours it one note at a time. Even if you are curious about this CD, it has many a tidbit about the Elvish lyrics in Viggo's song, &quot;The Retun of the King&quot; and lovely comments from Director and Composer. I look forward to my next purchase of the other soundtracks.<br />If you have any doubts about buying this CD don't it is well worth it for any fan young, or old of the &quot;Return of the King&quot;Give it as a gift, or even a gift to yourself. Perhaps it too will bring tears to your eyes.<br />Laurencia  blacklabnaex7@hotmail.com
B0000DZEA1|5.0|After hearing Howard Shore's stunning conclusion to Perter Jackson's epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, I can only state one thing: Excellent. Excellent doesn't really do justice to the magnificence of Shore's work. Like another classic trilogy score (Williams from Return of the Jedi), Shore presents a much more mature version of work. All our favorite themes are there: The Fellowship theme has now evolved into a wistful yet powerful fanfare for Aragorn. The Shire theme makes a return as does the Hobbit theme, both played magnificently by James Galway. Also returning is the Mordor theme, it's menacing notes now grown into a malevolent force. The Rohan theme also makes a brief reappearance, while the elvish theme comes to a full circle, representing Aragorn as he gets his sword in the track Andruil. The beginning of the cd is much more playful than that of the Two Towers, but it swiftly transforms into a majestic fanfare for Minas Tirith and Gondor which is among the greatest moments on the cd. Once again Enya does not sing on this cd, but in a suprisingly powerful decision, Billy Boyd aka Pippin does appear, singing briefly for Lord Denethor, capturing the rift between the Steward and Faramir. In track 17, The Return of the King, Shore takes a listener on a journey of all his developed themes for our heroes.  Like his previous two Lord of the Ring scores, Shore writes so the listener see's.  What I mean is that the music and the movie work so well together, that one actually envisions the beacons being lit at Minas Tirith or Eowyn swinging Merry unto her horse as the Rohirram ride out to Gondor.  Faramir's deadly attack on Osgiliath and the appearance of Theoden at dawn come vividly to life, but most moving and most emotional is track 15, beginning with the Fellowship fanfare as Aragorn exorts his soldiers to fight and ending with a new theme as Sam picks up Frodo and says, &quot;I can't carry It for you, but I can carry you!&quot;  It's enough to bring the listener totears.  As for Oscar-winning the song at the end by Annie Lennox, it is a vast improvement over Gollum's song, and captures triumph and tragedy of the conclusion of the Lord of the Rings.  I was only disappointed by there not being more music to hear.  I truly hope a complete soundtrack is released containing all the music  from the film.
B000001GQP|5.0|It may sound chauvinistic to say so, but in this case, I think a work by a German composer (using old German for part of its text) is best interpreted by German performers. Eugen Jochum is a superb interpreter, keeping this somewhat chaotic work from sounding sloppy or disjointed.<BR>There are some problems with volume levels -- they vary WIDELY.<BR>The chorus and orchestra is that of the Deutsche Oper. They are very fine. They are quite used to singing with expression, and it shows.<BR>Soloists are all good. I think I've heard better renditions of the dying swan, but this is clearly a matter of taste.<BR>The baritone solo part is extremely demanding to be done at all well. The baritone is Fischer-Dieskau, and there is none better. He does just incredibly well, showing devastingly fine technique.<BR>You'll find newer jobs, but none significantly better than this.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie is the absolute cream of the crap, vile rubbish for the true connoisseur. Kunfoo, Anime, chicks fighting with swords, blood spewing and splattering all over the place... It is better than being 13 again hanging out in your tree fort with a stack of new comic books and a six pack of beer you swiped from the old man.<BR> <BR>It is like Gwar, Shakespeare, comic books, beer, kungfoo and wrestling all wrapped together... topped with whipped cream AND sprinkles.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|There are a lot of movies people say they love, or are &quot;great movies.&quot;  But what makes a &quot;good film&quot; or movie?<br />Big Fish has it all in pleasantly satisfying measure.  This is not the greatest film of all time, but it might have been the best movie of its year.  In a time when a film would be hard-pressed to win an Oscar without being a blockbuster cash cow, Big Fish shone through as both a financial success (if not a blockbuster) and also a cinematic success.<br />If you enjoy a good story, inspiring cinematography, lovable (if not believable) characters, and compelling moments, then you will like Big Fish.  Coming from a guy who loved The Matrix, Couching Tiger, and The Princess Bride... Big Fish swims!  (I cried like a little kid with a finger caught in the car door).
6303477259|5.0|Whenever I am asked what concert film recording is my favorite, I have never hesitated to reply with a resounding: PINK FLOYD Pulse Live. It is hands down, the finest musical performance ever captured on film by ANY band and I will argue to the death with anyone who wishes to challenge. Further, in keeping with their tradition, the visual component is astonishing. The band's musical virtuosity and staying power is self-evident and a timeles tribute to the magic and genius that is Pink Floyd. After countless viewings, it still gives me chills up my spine as I watch with jaws agape. If you don't own this one, you are missing a major ingredient of music appreciation.<br />It is shameful that the producers of this piece have not yet released a DVD version. Perhaps as of this writing, it is on the way to stores.<BR>Ed Curley, Imageworks, Naperville, IL

B0002234LS|5.0|I have to wonder if this film would have been nearly as good without the likes of Johnny Depp in the key role of Mort Rainey.Thankfully we don't have to know.  I have heard the phrase recently on the title of an article about Depp...\\"a little Depp will do ya\\" well, in this case, \\"a lotta Depp will do as well and quite well\\"! I became an instant fan of his and the movie after seeing his work in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\",but, it was this film that made me truly appreciate what a gifted actor Depp truly is and it forced me to go back and rewatch his other work I had seen and watch his work I had not seen. All of which I was never disappointed. Let me just say I loved this movie. I stayed intrigued throughout the entire film and the ending did surprise me unlike some other reviews I have read who seemed disappointed. Don't let the fact that it was only in theaters for 2 or 3 weeks fool you. Its very good. I had not read the book because I really don't care for much of Stephen King's books so maybe that was a plus for me...I don't know. But this movie I take exception to even though I understand there were a few changes. It was \\"based\\" on the novella though keep in mind. Depp commanded the screen which is good since there were many many scenes with just him or with him and his dog Chico. I was never bored watching him play Mort. He was quirky, strange, an unpredictable and at many times very very humorous. In fact I chuckled and laughed quite often and was thoroughly entertained as well.Isn't that why we usually see a movie? Depp spilled out his lines as if he really was Mort. This could have been a character you didn't like,but, you did like him..you couldn't help yourself. Depp became the character ,which he usually does in all of his films, and you believe him. I was on the edge of my seat many times and trying to figure things out throughout all of it and then was very surprised in the end, and, afterall...\\"all that really matters is the ending\\"! I think many will be pleasantly surprised when they view this. Don't go watching this expecting the book on screen there were changes and some have said they were glad there were. Watch this as another intriguing Depp film. I am constantly amazed at how it seems every single character this man plays is different from the last one unlike so many actors who keep playing the same type of role in movie after movie. This is a good film. I don't think you will be disappointed.Charles Dutton did a nice job as well. I love that guy and he always plays these interesting characters in films as well. Mario Bello and Tim Hutton were good although Depp just simply outshined them. The characters were necessay, but, this was Depp's film. I think you will like it.
B00005YW4H|2.0|I still have to find out if this CD has one loooong endless song, or a shorter one repeated 14 times?<BR>Good musicians, good arrangements, but in the whole is sooo boring. Maybe because the mix is bringing too much in front the voice.<br />It's a girl that is singing for 1 hour, with a silent background track. If you love the voice of this girl, then it's okay, keep on listen to her singing. But there's not much music on the CD, just a girl, singing. All the time in the same way. Miau miau miau miaaaaau.

0451191153|5.0|First off, I am completely different than any of these characters in the Fountainhead. It is one of the reasons why I like this book so much. It challenged me to see another side of human nature and how we are in control of our fate and lives. It uplifts the perfect captilistic society, and challenges those who wants everyone to be treated exactly the same. It is book that should be read in these times, when socialistic ideas is flooding the media and our culture. Freewill is overlooked and we are in a sense forced to be what society deems &quot;best&quot; for everyone. This book is first and foremost about passion. Peter has none, Roark is consumed with it, and will never give in to those who want to take it from him. Passion is lost today, and I believe will even become even more stiffled in the future. It is ignored, hidden, and buried, because it frightens us to find it in ourselves and it frightens us to see it in other people. It challenges us to lead, but usually we decide to follow our logic rather than our truth. True passionate people in our society often are outsiders and freaks, just like Roark appeared to the characters in the Fountainhead. He believed in individual freedom and ideas, he lived for it and would have let it destroy him. Thats true passion. This book gives me the outlet to wonder what would happen if one day, I did completely what I wanted to do with my life, instead of conforming to what everyone else does, the 9 to 5, come home, living like a robot lifestyle. <BR>Although I don't always agree with Rands philosophy, I respect it. I believe we as humans are capable of so much more than what we give in our daily lives. The enemy in this book isn't a person but an idea, its conformity. Conformity verses individual freedom.<BR>The Fountainhead is one of my favorite books, not because of the writing or story, but because of its ideas and characters. Even if you don't like Rands philosophy, you can't forget her characters, and that makes a great book.

B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonnas last album is far better than the last offers of M. Carey, M. Jackson, W. Houston, C. Dion, Janet etc., because Madonna tried to break new rules and test new sondz on it, something that those artists didnt do - they only repeat themselves again &amp; again. Thats why shes called the QUEEN OF POP, QUEEN OF RE-INVENTION, MOST POWERFULL WOMAN IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS, MOST INFLUENTIAL WOMAN OF ALL TIMES etc. Who has the corage to criticize our actual society and the war like her? Who could mix those rhythms like her? Who could laugh about himself like Madonna did on this album?<BR>Its precious, gorgeous, the cover art is wonderful (M/M Paris), the singles are incredible and the only video I dont like is Hollywood although its a Jean Baptiste Mondino pearl. Cant wait to see her perform Hollywwod, Nothing Fails, Easy Ride, Love Profusion and the others on the stage...
0385512104|5.0|The plot of this novel is quite simple.  Christopher Boone is a 15 year-old autistic boy who, after finding his neighbor's poodle kill by a garden fork, sets out to discover the identity of the murderer.  Through his 'detecting' Christopher discovers the culprit but in doing so he also discovers so much more about himself.  But the true discovery is left for the readers of this wonderful novel who discover not only the uniquely different world as seen through Christopher's eyes but also his truly underlying genius.      I understand from previous reviewers that author Mark Haddon had actually worked with autistic children - and it is reflected in his brilliant first-person narrative, spoken through Christopher's authentic voice.   He shows how Christopher is neither capable of judging or ascribing any emotions to anything he experiences and thus is able to simplify his complex world.  Haddon doesn't coddle his character nor does he minimize or exaggerate the difficulties Christopher's parents have in dealing with a child with Christopher's condition.  And therein lies the true appreciation for this simply terrific novel.    \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time\\" is a 5-star read that should not be missed.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I saw a few parts of this movie and had to stop.  This movie was totally sick and twisted.  It was total insult to one's intelligence.  Save you time and money and don't watch this movie.  If it were possible to give this movie less than one star, I wouldn't hesitate to do so.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I found this CD amazing. I own the previous Devil's Night, and I loved that one too. I love all of the songs on this disc, some of my favorite being Bully and I Love You More. If you like all of those small rappers like Nelly, wise up, that's not rap, this is rap. Listen to this before you judge rap. This is quite the amazing of D12's work. None better.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Russell Crowe does a solid job as the British captain ordered to hunt down a French ship. His crew includes some interesting characters, but the main focus is on how the captain handles the multitude of situations he faces. For example, at one point the captain must decide between saving one of his crew vs. endangering the rest of them in the rescue attempt. Pretty heavy stuff. I rather enjoyed this leadership aspect of the film because it forces the viewer to think through \\"what would I do in that situation\\".<br /><br />One thing I did not like was the Darwin like sub-plot that involves the ship's doctor and his desire to explore the Galapogos islands. Some might find this interesting stuff, but I thought it was rather distracting and took away from the momentum during the second half of the film.<br /><br />I am a big fan of military history, but usually prefer ground combat to naval engagements. Having said that, Master and Commander is very entertaining, and gives what I consider to be an accurate portrayal of naval warfare in the early 1800s. Most of the sailor's time is spent in mundane tasks (like daily maintenance of the vessel), with occasions of great excitement during combat engagements. The director does a great job with the fighting scenes. He captures the chaos involved that leaders faced, and the courage required of the crew to gain victory.<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone interested in how naval combat was fought during this time period. If you are a Russell Crowe fan, you will also enjoy it, although it is not his best.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Many Van Halen fans call this their favourite Van Halen album. Is it the best? I think it's up there with Van Halen (S/T) and 1984. It may not be quite as good as those albums, but it's very, very good.<br />Fair Warning is a bit dark when you compare it to the bright, happy party rock on the band's other albums. Obviously, Unchained is the &quot;big&quot; song on this album. Mean Street is another great song, its intro being part of Eddie's live guitar solo for years. Hear About It Later is one of Van Halen's most underrated songs. It has it all -- great guitar work, a hard rock vibe, and a great hook. <br />This album is unique in that it features some songs that are certainly odd for Van Halen. Not everyone will like them, but those willing to be open to different sounds from this band will be rewarded -- the groove of Dirty Movies is certainly different, and Push Comes To Shove has a laidback vibe that is just slow enough to not be too slow.<br />Fair Warning rocks. As an ALBUM it is one of their best. Some other albums have great singles but as an album are lacking and contain material that could just about be called filler -- but Fair Warning, I find, delivers from beginning to end.<br />If you're new to the band, check out Van Halen (S/T), 1984, Van Halen II, or perhaps Best Of Volume One. Fair Warning is for when you've been digging Van Halen for a while, although I'm sure pretty much anyone could love at least a few songs on this album. From Mean Street to Sinner's Swing to Hear About It Later to Unchained to So This Is Love, this album is a classic.
B000009EAD|4.0|While there are some excellent songs here, this album simply is not the &quot;masterpiece&quot; that so many claim.  As it has been noted before, the structure of this album is reminiscent of their previous, more inspired effort, &quot;Dark Saga.&quot; I have the feeling that so many fans think this is their best work because the album ends with the furious &quot;Something Wicked Trilogy.&quot;  &quot;The Coming Curse&quot; is easily one of the finer songs here, and it does leave a great impression as the final track, but there are some average moments on other songs, as well as some mediocre tracks.  &quot;1776&quot; is just not that enthralling as an intrumental, coming off more like a re-hash of Iron Maiden's &quot;Losfer Words.&quot;  &quot;Disciples of the Lie&quot; sounds like forced aggression, but perhaps it's the way it was produced.  To me, it just doesn't sound honest enough.  There are some sing-along songs here that work much better in a live context than in the studio version, making the versions on &quot;Alive in Athens&quot; far superior.  However, the final &quot;Trilogy&quot; is noteworthy, as are a couple other tracks.  This is a good album, but &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; is more sinister, and &quot;Dark Saga&quot; is more inspired.  So many of the tracks on this album are more heartfelt on &quot;Alive in Athens&quot; which makes this album superflous for those who own that magnificent live album.  Completists may disagree.

B0000A98ZP|5.0|I love this movie. It's great because it takes the all too familiar clich archetypes that people face. More then likely you can fine a character to relate to because the movie has high school figured out really good.<BR>It's not one of those movies that glamorizes high school and the teenage years.<BR> While it does make fun of it, there is a strange serious side to clichs, and trying to break those boundaries.<BR>Awesome movie to watch, no matter how many times you have seen it.

B0001DI0FI|5.0|What storytelling -- this film is superby done! The tale of Jack Aubrey and his crew taking the HMS Surprise to the far side of the world to do battle with a superior French ship is the framework for a fascinating story of how life was back than. The details, and the human dramas, had me riveted. We see how the captain leads his men, some of whom are very brave children, through an incredible journey around Cape Horn and to the Galapagos. A trip of this sort is challenging enough for a sailor of today -- imagine undertaking it when you had no high-tech equipment to rely upon, but rather intelligence, strategy, a lot of hard work, and luck. The hardships the men endure, the bravery they display, and the joy they experience as part of their rare adventure, make for a fascinating story.

0688163173|5.0|Contrary to at least one of the reviewers, this is not a predictable format (easy to say if you happen to guess correctly!).  As much as I loved 'Mystic River', this is a totally different genre from his past works.  Nothing (again contrary to some reviewers) will prepare you for the totally literary and &quot;...most aesthetically right resolutions ever written....&quot; [ Publisher's Weekly ].  Lahane truly plays some serious games with his reader, as he does his characters, and it's very difficult to walk away from the pages not knowing where this will lead.  As others have said, it's not an easy synopsis to make without giving away things that you shouldn't know... the same things that our protagonist, Teddy Daniels, cannot be aware of as he works through a labyrinthine experience that, as a reader, you will not soon forget. Buy it - Enjoy it! You will not be disappointed.

Two of the best songs from this era &quot;Up Above the Daily Hum&quot;, and &quot;If I Go Mad/Funeral in My Head&quot; were not put on the album, but worth picking up.

She gave us all a hint with her addition of &quot;Charmed Life&quot; to The Look of Love that she had writing ability...<BR>With the help of her husband, she has formed new ground with this album.  I just listened to it all day at work and this has to be the most personal album she has ever made.  If you're looking for the usual jazz standards, exquisite instrumentation, lavish strings...it's not here.  Instead her heart is drenched in every song and every note.  Her piano playing is reminiscent of her live performances...but the album itself is like sitting in a warm room with her and listening to her play just for you....buy this now
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|Well, the title lives up to it's name.

B000148KK2|5.0|This album is all about transitions.  The death of Diana's mother as well as her long term mentor RoseMary Clooney inform these songs with a passionate soulfulness that strikes deep.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|I watched this film at the movies because Bill Murray starred in two of my all time favourite comedies (no, not Ghostbusters 1 and 2, I'm referring to What About Bob? and Groundhog Day).<br />There are some funny moments and Murray still has the same old charm, but, I was very disappointed by the end of the film. The plot is extremely weak and trust me, you've seen it before, many many times. Its basically about two people trapped in unhappy marriages and how they bond in an alien environment (Tokyo). That's it. Really.<br />The film tries too hard to justify the extremely thin storyline, which could have been told in less than an hour. The end actually comes as a surprise because you feel that part of the story is missing and that something else should happen. Very unsatisfying.<br />Its also quite unsympathetic to Japanese culture. I'm not Japanese and I'm also not easily offended, but if I was from Japan, I'd be angry at the film's portrayal of the country's culture as bizarre and unfriendly (as if major US cities is any less commercial and lonely. The American characters in the film should have felt right at home, especially since the Japanese pop culture portrayed is actually very much based on US pop culture).<br />Trust me, you're not missing anything here. Get Groundhog Day or What About Bob? Those are movies you may actually want to watch more than once.
038073186X|1.0|What happended? - I waited forever for Shutter Island to land in Canada in paperback.  What a HUGE disappointment.  After Mystic River and all his Patrick Kenzie novels, Shutter Island - well - it sucked.  Hard to follow, could not care one bit about the characters - frankly - I was bored by the third chapter.  Mr. Lehane - I certainly hope you were just having a bad day at the &quot;computer&quot;.  I hope that you keep to what you do best and that (for me at least) would be another in the Patrick Kenzie series.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Big Fish didn't do that great in the box office and also wasn't as well appreciated as it should've been. Critics seemed to take more of a liking to the foreighn film Barbarian Invasion. Since both came out around the same time and both are about an old man's last hours with his family. So most critics gave Big Fish lower ratings because they liked The Barbarian Invasion more. Some critics did notice it and appreciate it a lot but not enough did.<br />  Meanwhile I think Big Fish deserved the sort of appreciation that Forest Gump got. Hell for me it made me feel the way I did when I first saw Forest Gump as well. It's touching, uplifting, funny, romantic and highly imaginative. The performances  are great as well. Ewan McGregor is fantastic as young Edward Bloom and Albert Finny is equally great as old Edward Bloom. Billy Crudup (Almost Famous), Jessica Lange (Tootsie), Danny Devito, Helen Bohen Carter (Fight Club) and Steve Buscemi (Ghost World) are all good in supporting roles as well. Critic Roger Ebert said that Tim Burton does better work when he focuses more on a story than effects like with Sleepy Hollow and Edward. He makes it sound like Big Fish doesn't focus more on the story when it does. It's all story and all heart. Burton isn't George Lucas, he can make a good movie even without eye popping effects. He proved that with EdWood and I think he proved that with Big Fish too. When it was over, I was thinking about the acting, direction and the story and about how good of a movie I just saw.
B00008S2VG|5.0|AMERICAN LIFE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ALBUMS FOR ME, MAYBE BECAUSE I'M ONLY 17, FOR EXAMPLE I LOOOVE BEDTIME STORIES BUT WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED I WASN'T INTERESTED IN POP MUSIC, SO THIS ALBUM JUST REPRESENTS THIS MOMENT I'M LIVING RIGHT NOW.<br />01. American Life. I loved this song since it was first released online, I think it's better than all those hip-hop tracks and raps out there although I love Outcast, I also love the club mixes and specially the MISSY ELLIOTT remix available on the maxi single.<br />02. Hollywood. It's an incredible song, very Madonna-style, for those who like Ray Of Light, Beautiful Stranger and Amazing it's just perfect, with its guitars, beats and vocals. &quot;Music stations always play the same songs, I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong&quot;. It's an anthem.<br />03. I'm So Stupid, very innovative, very different from all other Madonna tracks, it's more rock but at the same time electro;<br />04. Love Profusion. An incredible song, like someone said here, touchy lyrics, a very fell-good track.<br />05. Nothing Fails. The most beuatiful declaration of love I've ever heard on a pop song. Love the gospel chorus, love the guitar and the electronic effects.<br />06. Nobody Knows Me. An incredible dance track, unique.<br />07. Intervention. The second most beautiful song on the album.<br />08. X-Static process. Only Madonna's voice and guitar, touchy, like a classy folk lullaby.<br />09. Mother &amp; Father. Autobiographic, very electro, up to date and under a clear 80's influence.<br />10. Die Another Day. The biggest hit of 2004, the James Bond song. One of her best lyrics to date. Innovative, electronic with strings, it's 100% Madonna but follows the tendencies of the classic James Bond themes too.<br />11. Easy Ride. The most beautiful song of the album, very passionate, low at the beginning and electric after a while.<br />Madonna's singing on this album is simply her best singing work to date. She's using her voice beautifully, even better than in Evita or Ray Of Light.<br />This album is 100000000000000 times more interesting and mature than Music. Higly recommended.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I wasn't going to buy the cd because I wasn't that impressed with the previous album or the \\"my band\\" song, but this disc really proves this \\"band\\" has a lot of talent.  The songwriting is so funny, yet they can be pretty hard at times.  The first track and get my gun are great hard songs.  Bitch is Eminem at his best in his first verse and the rest of the crew are also strong on this disc, better than their rap on \\"Devils Night.\\"  I strongly recommend this album, I honestly see it winning a grammy or two!!  Pick it up.
B00005T7I1|2.0|This movie is worth watching but has no visual key, all the original charecter seem to feed of Warren Beatty's every move, it did make me think alot and the dark nature of this shatteringly wasted movie will confuse you into a point that you will totally hate it, no main plot and a small appearence from Maddonna, if this movie had been directed by James Camaron or Spyke Jonzes, it would've been a major success, too bad the great charecter has been entirely ruined, no hope for a sequel just comes to show you how this disastorious movie hit the point of no fame.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|The criteria for a song to appear on this album was as follows:A song had to be released as a single,and,that song had to go all the way to number 1.There were a ton of great beatle songs that were never released as singles,if they were,they no doubt would have gone to number 1 also. As it is,these 27 were released as singles and got to number 1.This album is in guinness book of world records for being the fastest selling album ever and for being the biggest selling cd!
B000046PVN|5.0|Hollywood's big secret about why you probably like a lot of films and television shows is in the MUSIC, and how the music fits into the story. Here, you have a fantastic example with the score prepared by the now legendary John Williams.<br />Granted, music can take a bad movie and make it better, but in this case, it takes a brilliant movie and makes it phenomenal!<br />Originally, the soundtrack recording offered for this classic film (on vinyl) was adequate... then a later CD version actually edited out some tracks to fit it all on one disc! What were they thinking?<br />Finally, Rhino gives the music from this film the treatment it so richly deserves. This is a must for collectors of Williams's work, as it includes nearly every music cue from the film, and some bonus alternate recordings, all on two compact discs. <br />The tracks are positioned well, and the included booklet has a lot more! The liner notes really help to paint the picture of what the music is doing in each scene. Chock full of photos from the film, and lots of behind the scene notes, and with a foreword written by the Man Of Steel himself, Christopher Reeve, It's like a visit to Metropolis!<br />Where &quot;Star Wars - Episode IV&quot; started the Williams era, &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; solidified it. Highly recommended.

Proven Metal machine ... this isn't some Zakk side project.. these are the guys that came to my town last year and blew [me] off... it's a shame..

B0001Z53AQ|2.0|I agree with Dalton Higgins' review concerning this, the second album by D-12, Eminem's crew. While it would be considered a groundbreaking piece by any other (as it does manage to successfully combine humor with shockingly offensive content), when it comes to the inevitable comparisons with Eminem's solo works, it just doesn't add up. There's no comparison. <BR>The fact is, Eminem has and always will overshadow the rest of <BR>D-12, and the reason is this: he's better than they are. With the exception of Proof, Eminem is by far better than the other guys in &quot;His Band&quot;; Proof has proved himself a worthy MC, and his production on &quot;Good Die Young&quot; is quite good.<BR>When it comes to Eminem's beat-making, it is true that his production is not on the same level as his mic skills - every track of his has the same formula (moody bassline, with the possibility of a sampled vocal from a song from the 70s - like Kanye West, but less interesting, and, in all honesty, BORING!!)<BR>That being said, I think this album could have used more production from Dr. Dre or Kanye, but Eminem rarely works with anyone outside of Shady/Aftermath, and the lack of more varied beats could very-much be dependent on his influence. Eminem's a gifted MC (perhaps the best out today), but he's no DJ Premier. <BR>&quot;Runnin&quot;, the track he produced for the Tupac Resurrection Soundtrack, is as good as he is going to get behind the boards. <BR>Enough about Eminem, let's talk about D-12! This album, rap-wise, is decent. The guys have worked on their mic skills since &quot;Devil's Night&quot;, but I don't think that the writing is worth much without the PRODUCTION to back it up. Plus, Eminem's rhymes continue to overshadow his bandmates' - which could be the reason why no one knows the name of his band. <BR>To tell the truth, &quot;My Band&quot; has one of the most annoying beats I've ever heard. It gets in your head, but it's not the kind of song you want up there. You can't stand hearing that cheesy loop over and over again! &quot;Purple Pills&quot;, was a great song, with a great beat, and great verses.<BR>To sum it up, 'World is a step up in rhymes, as D12 realized that they have to work to hold their own against Slim, but unfortunately, it's a step down in tracks. In order for D12 to be taken seriously as an act, and not just another throw-away Eminem project (Obie Trice, anyone?), they have to form their own style - we already have a Marshall Mathers, we don't need five wannabes running amok.
B00003CXCW|5.0|It's always been fashionable to believe that the old Hollywood films were greatly superior to those of today.  Unfortunately, when one takes an honest look at many of the so-called classics, the dating of the material tends to ruin the viewing experiece.<br />SUNSET BOULEVARD is a stunning exception.  It holds up so well that it almost feels current.  In fact, with today's entertainment fixation, I'm tempted to say that SB could be released in the present to the same acclaim it received back in the 50's.  It was that ahead of its time.<br />Scores of films since then have tried to comment on Hollywood, but none of them have reached SUNSET BOULEVARD's watermark.  SB manages to tie its criticism of the movie biz to several other themes while treating the audience to an engaging plot.  You certainly can't say that about BURN, HOLLYWOOD BURN.  <br />SUNSET BOULEVARD is almost good enough to convince the viewer that they don't make 'em like they used to...
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Yeah, yeah, yeah...Geffen could of easily released a much better GNR greatest hits compilation, but the songs are remastered! Man do these songs sound good! I'm a huge GNR fan and I'm pretty much going to buy whatever kind of GNR material comes out, especially if it is remastered! Don't get me wrong though...I do not own the Spaghetti Incident. Although still...damn Geffen could of released a much better GNR greatest hits compilation!
B00003CWRX|3.0|Full of portentious music and camera angles, The Insider plays like a story that is about to reveal a mystical, transforming truth, or at least something shocking.  But that's the problem.  The movie isn't about a network news show cow-towing to financial pressures.  Sure, that story is here, but it never becomes the major focus of the film.  And the movie isn't about one man and his crisis of conscience or character.  Again, we are shown the thin, superficial layers of this personal struggle, but not much more.  Instead, the movie drills into, and focuses on relentlessly, the &quot;secret&quot; this &quot;insider&quot; wants to tell the world, but can't.  And that point is driven home in so many different ways--as if Jeffrey Wygand (who I suppose is the main character) has something extraordinarily interesting and devastating to reveal, and that the world will change as a result of him going public.<br />That's the tragedy of The Insider.  Because now, a few years of perspective later, we realize that Wygand's inside story is both obvious and relatively unimportant.  Sure, it caused some big tobacco settlements to be struck, but it packs relatively little dramatic punch.  And so all this pomp and circumstance about his revelations and their impact on society at large has no legs.  And the loud, pretentious soundtrack, the slow motion effects, the bombastic set-up, well, it's a set-up for disappointment. It's a bit like setting your home movies to a Wagnerian opera.<br />I gave the movie a three because I thought Pacino's and Plummer's performances, and to a slightly lesser extent, Crowe's, merited it.  Plus, being inside the conflict within CBS was fascinating.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is Madonna reinventing herself again, transforming the actual electronic music and the 80s typical beats in one of the best albums I bought this year (what a shame!!!)<br />But I loved it, and can´t wait to see her performing it live (in my hometown TORONTO!!!)<br />Love Profusion is right now the nr. 01 in my personal charts, Easy Ride is nr. 05 and Intervention is nr. 11 LOL
B0001AP12G|4.0|I listened to Kanye's album on the subway today. Fortunately, the lyrics were so engaging that I had to stop reading my book just to listen and pay serious attention to the them. This is a plus. Although when I got to around track 15 or 16, I got really annoyed by the anti-college bent of the CD. Also, around this point, there are many anti-college skits and rants. There are several skits on the CD and they are tiring.<br />I am impressed by the caliber of the guest rappers on the different songs. It was nice hearing lyrics from Common, Talib, Mos Def, and Jay-Z, as opposed to some rapper pulling their friend from the block who just wants to be down.<br />The beats were varying and enticing, and I never found myself just drifiting along through the album on several beats that sound the same. This was, in my opinion, one of the most creative rap albums to come out in the past few years. I'm glad I picked up this CD.
0743243307|5.0|This is the story of Nazneen, a Bengali woman \\"Left to her Fate\\" at birth, who marries and moves to England to marry Chanu, an older, pompous man who seems unable to get anything right. The story follows Nazneen over many years as she grapples with the Big Questions of Life: Is there such a thing as fate?  Can an individual control or influence it?  Are you bound by it?  If this sounds dull, rest assured, it isn't.  This is a wonderful story filled with vibrant, unforgettable characters.  The author does a wonderful job of allowing us to see Nazneen's slow progression from dutiful daughter and wife to quietly confident woman.  What makes it so true to life and keeps the book from being a feminist screed is that she shows that Nazneen's progression is not without hardship: \\"she was as startled by her own agency as an infant who waves a clenched fist and strikes itself upon the eye.\\"<br />Hard to believe that this is a first novel, it is so well-written.  A true pleasure!
0307203204|5.0|A note to all fans of I Can Fly -- most editions are abridged, and they DON'T say so.  In fact, the page quoted in Amazon's editorial review (\\"Crunch crunch crunch/ I'm a goat out to lunch\\") is one of many pages NOT in the hardcover version of the book.  False advertising, dudes!  If you want to read I Can Fly in its full original glory, you have to get the \\"library binding\\" edition.
B0001IN080|5.0|Forget about the reviews saying the editing on the DVD is amateurish...its very cool and very artistic....yes, there are three bonus tracks from AOL.sessions which are more in keeping with what these complaining viewers would like...overlit TV talk show (daytime) productions......and they are also good, but its a very well paced program and very hip.  If you are still lamenting the loss of mono and are confused by stereo you may want to avoid this product as more than one camera was used to film this series of performances ....and its switch from color to black and white might make you wonder if your set is broken....or actually wonder how you got color depending on your vintage.  The songs are great , the singer is excellent and the program enoyable....
0440238609|5.0|Very rarely can I say that a book grabs my attention from the first page, but this trilogy had me from PAGE ONE!<br />Pullman's alternate universes collide in a story that has a simple yet not to simple ideal. The characters are memorable to say the least with depths and stories of their own that only add to the main plot.<br />If you enjoy fantasy, this has it all: adventure, magic, love, creatures from different worlds... it truly is a master work of art!!<br />Warning: I believe this trilogy is too advanced and violent for any child under the age of 12 or 13, and is also a WONDERFUL book for adults and fantasy lovers.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This is a great movie.  Liked it a lot. Keisha Castle-Hughes was outstanding.  A worthy oscar performance.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a beautifully written show that I feel everyone should see.  It has all the aspects of a great show and more.  The main characters are played by great actors and are full of depth.  I have never seen a better show, and after rewatching this on DVD I know that I never will.  If only they would bring firefly back to television I would be the happiest girl alive.
0440180295|4.0|The first statement I have about this book is that it is not for everyone. This book's plot jumps around between different moments in the main character's life. If to read a certain section of the book where the main character, Billy, is in World War II, in the next few pages, he could be an infant or an elderly man! Therefore the plot is difficult to navigate through.<br /> However, the plot is no reason to deter you from his excellent novel! If you can follow it, the plot is extraordinary! The author introduces us to vivid characters, new lands, and a great message: Choose what is important and good in life and focus on that, and try to ignore the bad. You see, in Billy's spastic trips through time he meets a race of aliens called Tralfemadorians. These aliens can see in the fourth dimension, which is time, and they teach Billy a valuable lesson about life: \\"That's one thing Earthlings might learn to do, if they tried hard enough: Ignore the awful times, and concentrate on the good ones.\\" (Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut page 117).<br /> This is also a great antiwar novel. The only plot that returns in a linear way in this novel is Billy's experiences in World War II. We learn of a place called Dresden, where there was no military action on behalf of the Nazis, it was a civilian area used only as a Prisoner Of War camp. The Allies bombed it and killed more people there than when they dropped the atomic bomb in Japan. The author shows us the true horrors of war, the desire of man to win; at all costs.<br /> Slaughterhouse-Five is an excellent novel for most readers, but those who cannot follow plots, might want to look elsewhere. It has a great message and compels us to look at ourselves inside and see what we would do to win, what we would sacrifice.

0743454529|5.0|From the first page Jodi Picoult had captured my attention. I picked up this book out of boredom and the need for a book for a school book review, and what I got was an amazing story of a family faced with decisions no one should ever have to make. <br />We're first introduced to Anna, a 13 year old girl who is far from normal. Her life has been plagued by surgeries, transfusions, shots, and hospitalization. But she's completely healthy. She was conceived for the purpose of helping her sick sister, Kate. Throughout the book we begin to see how what seemed like such a logical and necessary decision isn't so black and white. We see the consequences such a decision can make. <br />Picoult's changing of the point of view each chapter really helped make the story. It was essential to see what motivated each character to make the decisions they did and how it effected them.<br />This book raised questions I have never thought to ask. It shows how nothing is very clear-cut in life. Basically, it really made me think.
B000002KHY|5.0|Wherever I take my backpack, which is pretty much everwhere, I take this cd in my cd holder, along with my Peter Paul and Mary &quot;Around the Campfire&quot; cd, Zachary Provost, Josh Groban <BR>BSB, *NSYNC, Beatles 1 cd and Elton John &quot;One Night Only&quot; cd. James Taylor is one of the classics. There's something so simple and beautiful abobut his music: it's just his voice and the guitar. We need to get back to that!!
B00009MGQL|5.0|This is not a crap.This is a challenge.Maybe Jeff is an oldtime guitar player.But I think that Jeff in this album is like a techno hard rock style.So many guitarist come and gone.but Jeff still lives here alive.The most important thing is that he still breathes in the  present time.Jeff is not lost in the background music. Still his guitar sound appeals to me emotionally.This album is a future sound that lingers on in his head.Forget the &quot;Wired&quot; album. Watch his present tense!

B0001Z53CY|4.0|After &quot;Devils Night&quot; many D12 &amp; Eminem fans have been waiting for this album to come out...and it was worth the wait they matured a lot,the beats got better and the lyrics did as well. I don't need to say much but this album is very good after the first listen i didn't like it much but after i played it again and really listened to it unlike most people who just skip through the music and i like it a lot this album isn't a 5 its more of a 4 or 4 1/2 and its a more put-together album than &quot;Devils Night&quot; so go support D12 they worked hard for this album but remember don't expect to much cause this was record during the time Eminem was working on Obie Trice's debut &quot;Cheers&quot; Tupac's &quot;Resurrection&quot; and more but his beats and rhymes are still good...WELCOME 2 D12 WORLD!!!!!!! GO PICK IT UP!!!!!!!!!!
0783231032|4.0|I had never seen the film in 1979, so I had an open mind about the film. I have to say that the worst thing that happened to this film is that Speilberg directed it and has his imprint all over the film, which should have been a darker comedy than it turned out to be. However, you wouldn't have had the cast that wound up being in the film (early appearances of Ackroyd, John Candy and Mickey Rourke in film, and Bob Zemeckis' first real break into film), a nod to Kurosawa (Toshiro Mifume is the sub captain), Speilberg's own &quot;Duel&quot;, and to Kubrick (Slim Pickens from Dr. Strangelove shows up). Considering John Belushi did few films, it's worth having on that alone. The dance sequences and cinematography are definitely worth the awards they would wind up picking up. <br />The film can overwhelm you a bit and confuse you, but that was the point. However, there's a lot in the film that can be applied in 2004, like Robert Stack's character (think Rumsfeld). Had Zemeckis had the pull to make what he envisioned it to be, it would have been a classic black comedy without a doubt,although in Europe it always has been.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you haven't bought this DVD set yet, then stop what you are doing and order right now.  You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy Firefly, and you certainly don't have to be a western type either. Those genres are just the thin and subtle dressing.  It's not about ray guns or ten gallon hats.  Nor is it about conflict with weird aliens, or bringing the outlaws to justice.  No, Firefly is far above that, and only uses sci-fi and western aspects to flavour its stories, not be pawns of them.  The true centrepiece and focus of the show is its great collection of characters, and the cast that live them. These guys are shiny !  What they're doing, why they are doing it, and how Joss Whedon and crew deliver it in a unique perspective is what will draw you in.  Where other shows will work hard to keep within the formula, Firefly works hard to get out of the formula.  Refreshing. Situations will happen in the Firefly stories where you think you know what is going to happen next, because all the formulaic shows that you watched up to now taught you that is how the formula goes, and thus, this is how the story should go.  This is likely the exact point where you are reminded that this is Firefly, and things work to make the story and characters interesting, not to follow a formula.<br />Because of Firefly's direction to try and be original, I think it may have been a part of what caused some people to not 'get it' when it was originally aired on TV.  That element, and the back story pilot not being aired, combined to make it very disorienting for the first time viewer. Thankfully, that can't happen on the DVD due to the episodes being organized in the order they should have been viewed.<br />What are you are waiting for ?  Buy this piece of gold now !

B0001Z53AQ|4.0|Okay,here's the deal..D12 has matured a little..Usually you think of D12 and shocking lyrics and Bizarre being well...Bizare..But he actually is kind of tame on this CD and it works.Everyone on this CD,especially Swift-Kuniva-Kon Artist step up their game on this sophomore effort.Proof is good as usually,and Bizarre drops some pretty good rhymes.He's on more songs than he was on Devils Night.And he even gets his own song AGAIN like he had on their Freshman disc Devils Night.His song(JUST LIKE YOU) is cool and sick kind of LOL.Eminem is on alot more songs this time.11 in total I believe.whether it is on the chorus or verse or both.THe best 5 songs are as follows..The hit MY BAND,U R THE ONE(a song about wanting a female,cool mood to it) How come(kind of dark but meaningful) Leave dat boy Alone(Eminem spits an interesting/weird chorus on this one LOL) Get my Gun(AWESOME SONG).40 oz is basically a GROUP song.not meaning everyone is on the track,but it's one of those songs where they yell the same thing over and over.like FLIP FLIP FLIP FLIP on flip's GAme ovEr.it's cool though.All in all,this CD is a little bit tame and mature compared to the last CD.But lyrically,it is a step up.If you want a good CD by the very gifted memebers of D12,then this is it.Devils Night was more of a fun/joke album.it didnt really have meaningful songs,this does.And it doesn't hurt D12's appearance.They are still goofy and fun to listen to.They are always up on recent events in the news(Saddam;s capture,Kobe Bryant to name two events LOL)So all in all,if you want an album filled with Eminem at his best...Dont pick this up..this show cases Swift,Kon Artis and Kuniva the most..and hey,they do the job very well.Em drops some nice stuff on here,but all in all he is not at his best.And no he hasn;t fell off,but when he raps with D12 he usually doesnt spit his best stuff anyway.Bizarre is still weird and proof is still the man.One thing you might not like about this is all the gun references though..Yeah once or twice a song you'd hear that on Devils Night,but on here you here &quot;mac milly&quot; and toaster more than a 50 Cent song sometimes...And that is saying something..Even Em speaks about guns alot and he kind of goes gangster on this one..I personally dont mind it because he can rap any style,slow/fast,gangster/pop..so hes good at it..but all in all D12 comes off as a wu-tang/G-unit mix with a dose of Devils Night humor.Basically,to wrap this up...Devils Night was their FUN album.That was Eminems chance to have fun after doing the Marshall Mathers album.D12 World is them being more like other rap groups out there,but that is not a bad thing.They hold their own and after a few listens you will like this disc.it's hard to get used to at first,because Em raps differently and the beats are nice,but akward.But all in all,after about the 3rd-5th listen,this will easily be noted as the best lyrical rap CD in quite a while.especially when it deals more abouts guns and emotions like losing a friend(Bugz) Bugz even gets a rap he did back in 97 on here..and he was GOOD.Almost as good as Eminem in my opinion..Rakim is still the best ever really though..anyway..this album is more about guns and mature stuff than joking and purple pills..So if thats what you want,a good lyrical rap CD with cool beats from various producers,then pick up this D12 CD.its Eminem and his boys at their best when you really think of the circumstances.They could have gone softand done joke songs(nasty mind,purple pills) but they came off as being real rappers and they have definitely made an all around better album musically(beat wise,sound wise) and of course most importantly in a hiphop record,they did it lyrically..lyrically this CD rocks DUDE!!!! LOL Gotta love D12.Dirty Dozen forever! EMINEM!!!!!!!!
B00018D44U|1.0|This CD SUCKS!!!! I don't understand why this woman is selling so many of this?! I can stand it. I brought and now I will trash it. If you like real music don't buy it. Buy Cyndi Lauper or Natalie Merchant instead. HORRIBLE!!!!!
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|My Band is the album's Purple Pills?  Aside from the fact that they are the first singles off of Devil's Night and D-12 World, they have nothing in common...unless your are listening to them with Dalton Higgens.  Purple Pills is a tribute to drugs.  My Band is a satirical look at how the public views D-12.  Purple Pills has a bass heavy beat that is nothing like the beat for My Band.  So where does the connection lie?  As for Eminems beat making skills being called into question, I ask you this Dalton Higgens: Have you heard the song Runnin?  If Eminem decided to stop rapping, he could make a serious living making beats.  D-12 world is hot cd...no questions about it.  40 OZ makes the cd worth buying by itself.  If D-12 World is a side  project for Eminem, as Dalton Higgens claims, then why isn't Eminem on all of the songs?  Why are Dre, Kanye West, Red Spyda (Leave Dat Boy Alone - another classic), and Mr. Porter making beats on the cd?  Perhaps because D-12 World is a D-12 cd, not an Eminem mixtape.  It my opinion that D-12 world puts Devil's Night to shame.  It is not that Devil's Night was all that bad, it is that D-12 world is that good.  D-12 has clearly progressed on this album, as oppossed to regressed like Dalton Higgens reviews.

B00018D44U|2.0|I read in a magazine interview that Miss. Jones did not want to be seen as &quot;Just A Jazz Singer&quot; an on this cd she wanted to show her country music influence, which she got growing up in Dallas, Tx. On a side note she came out of the same perfoming and visual art school as fellow Dallas Texans, the great contempary jazz trumpter Roy Hargrove, and neo-soul singer Erykah Badu. Back to this cd, while I really like her voice, she is out of her league as some sort of neo-country female singer. Although the cd does have it's solid moments such as track 11 &quot;The Prettiest Things.&quot;  I give her credit for try to branch out into different sounds,but one must know what works and what does not. I hope that by her next new cd she knows the The quote of Miles Davis &quot;Great Music, like great art is more define by what's left out, rather than what's put in.&quot;
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|D12 World is a good cd.  Despite all of the cursing it is pretty good.  I think that some of the songs were terrible such as I'll Be Damned and The bonus track, but some of them were classics such as the hit single My Band and Get My Gun.
B0000028RR|5.0|If you like music of any kind than this is a must have album for you. The guitar and bass playing is simply amazing, and they seem to play off of each other as if they were one instrument. The emotion in this album is almost untouchable. This album also features many different types of music blended seemlessly together. The first time I heard this album I was hooked. The first track is an assault on your senses and just your mind in general. 'Bombtrack' is the most fitting title for a song that I have ever come across. The second track continues the raw emotion that was started on the first track. I dont think that much more needs said about a song entitled 'Killing in the Name'. Each and every track on this album is a classic without exception. My personal favorites are 'Killing in the Name', 'Bullet in the Head', 'Wake up', and 'Township Rebellion'. I would urge anyone to buy this album and listen to it as soon as possible. You will not be dissapointed. Even if hard music is not your thing, this albume is a must have.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This movie was released just after my own father died of cancer.  I was not sure I wanted to see it, but this was probably the best thing I could have done.  What did it for me was the quality of the characters.  While they were presented in a way that was so surreal and colorful, they were also very human and relatable.  I found myself reflecting back on my own relationship with my father and the stories he told me as a child.  Above all this movie was steeped with integrity.  It was as honorable, imaginative and lovely as fatherhood itself.  I recommend this to anyone who has ever had a father or sons (or for that matter a mother or daughters... so pretty much everyone).  Mr. Burton really makes you look beneath the surface to find the truth in the message rather than the facts. I am going to buy this for my Mom for mother's day, and watch it with her and a box of tissues.  Thank you Mr. Burton!
B000002LRX|5.0|Undoubtedly, Angel Dust is THE most underrated album when it first came out. There's no parallel whatsoever can be written about this album compared to The Real Thing. Each album stands on the strength of its own. No surprise if a great album of this magnitude will conquer the radiowaves if re-released right now.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm glad lots of people are giving this CD good reviews, but I have yet to hear from them some of the reasons why I consider it to be the best in my collection. First of all, yes, Amy Lee does have an absolutely astounding voice, but there's more to the band than just her. Ben Moody, the guitarist, is exellent, and the drummer is very good too. Possibly my favorite characteristic of the band is the poetic and meaningful lyrics. Amy sings about everything from death and suicide to love, God, and even hope. I would probably call them Goth rock (by the way I'm an alternative gal myself, and I pretty much hate hard rock, so I was very suprised that I liked this band as much as I do), but their songs range from powerful metal to serious gothic pieces all the way to beautiful ballads with the only instruments being a piano and strings. There are so many wonderful things about this band. At least listen to this CD a couple times. It definitely grows on you.<br />In case you're interested, here is my personal evaluation of each song:<BR>Going Under-Best on the album. Perfect balance b/w guitar and vocals.<BR>Bring Me to Life-Good, but there are many that are better. Don't think you know Evanescence just because you've heard this song a gazillion times.<BR>Everybody's Fool-nice. Speaks very powerfully against the problem of idolizing stars.<BR>My Immortal-Beautiful ballad. I never get sick of it.<BR>Haunted-Probably my least favorite, but not bad. Very bass-driven and gothic.<BR>Tournaquet-Second favorite. Absolutely beautiful lyrics asking  for forgiveness after commiting suicide.<BR>Imaginary-Good song. lots of really nice instrumentals.<BR>Taking Over Me-One of my favorites (I know I have a lot). About a love lost.<BR>Hello-Amy shows off her voice and hits some notes that I never thought were humanly possible.<BR>My Last Breath-Very poetic song about love and death.<BR>Whisper-not my favorite, but it grew on me. Definitely interesting.<BR>Hopefully I,ve convinced you thatEvanescence is much more than a comercial band out for money. They are musically gifted and Fallen is a truly wonderful CD.
B000001DQG|5.0|I was 12 the Summer Caribou was released.  So memories of holding hands with girls in Bible school may make me less than objective concerning this recording.  I was also a huge Elton fan.<br />That being said, this is a must have for anyone who likes pop music.  The tunes are tuneful, the horns are soulful, and the harmonies are dead on.  &quot;Deepcuts&quot; like Grimsby, and Stinker always make me smile with the first note.  <br />The liner notes are also very informative and explain why Caribou broke new ground for EJ, Bernie, and the boys.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|The movie is SO frustrating.  Such a nice idea, such a good set up, something interesting and wonderful to explore -- giving us a peek at older characters -- but Keaton's character goes off with the wrong guy!  Reeves is funny, sweet, smart, and a hell of a lot sexier than Nicholson.  I mean, the scene where he brings her the flowers!  Or where he chases her around the corner into the bedroom!  But Keaton's character is just a little too neurotic to accept something so wonderful as a guy who has the maturity from the start ... still, there are some good lines, some good scenes.  The daughter and the sister are fabulous.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Ok, I'll make this short and sweet. I swore I wouldn't judge this movie before part 3. Now that it's all over, I have to say that in retrospect, Reloaded is even more use- and senseless than I thought it would be.
0312995423|1.0|One reviewer mentioned bad research; well that is an understatement.  Did the author really refer to X11 as \\"X-eleven\\"?  Well, yes, several times.  It made me wonder if the extent of his research was done verbally in a bar.  His \\"X-eleven\\" veneer of knowledge seemed to apply to every technical aspect of this book.   <br />The only good thing I can say about my experience reading this book was that it was better than reading the in-flight magazine between SF and NY.
0385336810|4.0|This book is laugh out loud funny, just like the Shopaholic series.  It should be a must read on your summer list!
0385510438|4.0|John Grisham is probably best known for his many formulaeic legal thrillers.  Some are better than others but they became too predictable.  Some became his vehicles for commenting on society   and social values and sacrificed the story to make a point (i.e. &quot;The Chamber).<br />His most recent book, &quot;The Last Juror&quot; takes us back to the Grisham we saw in &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; which I believe is is best novel.  Through extensive character development, we get to know Willie Traynor, Harry Rex, Miss Callie and the other inhabitants of Clanton.  Seen through the eyes of Willie, we become immersed in their lives as the biggest murder of the county occurs.  The trial, the subsequent years, the release of the murder and the revenge killings happen to people we have grown to know and care about.  <br />It becomes a page-turner because we want to know about these people and their lives.  The ending is fairly predictable but it is a satisfying tale and well worth a few hours of your time.  It is a well written book and much more believable than many of his high-speed &quot;legal thrillers&quot; that leave you breathless but forgetting the story not long after you are done.  The well-developed characters  and the sense of place(a small Mississippi town in the 70's) are what make this book unforgettable.
0688163173|2.0|I'm shocked.  &quot;Mystic River&quot; was such a good book that I was looking forward to my next Dennis Lehane novel.<br />But &quot;Shutter Island&quot; telegraphs its punches to the nth degree, and I figured out what the conclusion had to be when I was a third of the way through the book.<br />I'm not totally turned off of Lehane's novels, but I sure hope that &quot;Shutter Island&quot; is the only deviation in his repertoire.
B00003CX9E|1.0|Citizen Kane is a hymn to all filmmakers who have ever tried to create something artistic and meaningful and failed miserably every step of the way.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|This album is very disappointing.  Clapton could have done Johnson pure.  Robert Johnson himself was one man with a guitar; I'd hoped for that with this album, Clapton channelling Johnson, if you will.   What we get instead is a very muddily produced ensemble, little of the Clapton magic, and the worst version of Come On In My Kitchen I've heard in a long while.  I hate that I don't like this: it combines Clapton with Johnson, two of the best blues artists of all time.  But, frankly, it's mostly bad.  I gave it 2* just because it's Clapton playing the blues, and how bad can that be?  But get Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings if you want to hear this as it should be heard.
B00000JFV9|5.0|This one will hit you.  If it's not the waa waa guitar, it's the killer basslines.  If it's not the killer basslines, it's the jungle drums in the background.  If it's not the crazy jungle drums, it's the incredible socially relevant lyrics.  This set came out a good 15 years before I was born, but I can still relate to the problems presented tracks like &quot;Freddie's Dead&quot; and &quot;Pusherman&quot;.  This album is a classic, ridiculously good.  Hats off to the late, great Curtis Mayfield on this one.
140003180X|5.0|I am admiring the main character, Mms Ramotswe, so much.  She has such a wonderful insight into human behavior.

B00005JMEW|2.0|Even though the postmodern era has ended with september 11th, this movie persists in the motif. It falls in the mindless genre of Japanese action film, and oddly enough, the protagonist weilds a sword while on the airplane. Kill Bill is nuanced and subtle!

0800141601|1.0|This film is an insult to the viewers intelligence and the Arthurian tradtion. I can not believe how awful this film is. Wooden acting, contempt for the source material, some of the worst period costumes and armour ever seen in a film and a scrip to bad they could use it for torture sessions...
B000002HH2|5.0|Cassandra Dongoski say this album is freaky and scary.  Of course! It would be scary for anyone who likes Britney, Christina, and Hillary Duff. You know why? Because this music is actually GOOD!!! All of Bjork's albums have shown her growth as an artist and any true fan of Bjork would see that.  If you want to get into Bjork I would recommend this album since it's more accesible than Homogenic or Vespertine, and Debut's is somewhat technoish yet an underrated album.  I warn you however, once you get into it you won't get out
B00004TBWR|5.0|By the time they released \\"Willy and the Poor Boys\\" in November 1969, Creedence Clearwater Revival were one of America's top attractions, and one of the most unlikely. By soldiering against the grain of late-60s psychedelia and drug-induced poetry sung by drugged out hippies, CCR (along with The Band) possessed a sound that was original and in stark contrast to the psychedelic revolution, but somehow fate gave them success and made them one of the most popular voices of that generation. This, CCR's fourth album, embodies the magic that made them both popular and artistically dignified at the same time, but it is also an easy contender for the group's most varied release (competing with \\"Pendulum\\" for that title).<br />John Fogerty's songs were as good as ever, and here they advanced forward just a bit in a mix of Southern creoles that seemed to come straight from a laid-back bayou somewhere in Louisiana (though Creedence actually hailed from California), but now CCR appeared to be addressing a generation. The group keeps their down home roots in tact with the undisputed classic `Down on the Corner' which pays homage to music and good times, with Fogerty's references to the individual members of CCR, using the nicknames \\"Rooster,\\" \\"Poorboy\\" and \\"Blinky.\\" Two left-center (for 1969) selections `Poorboy Shuffle' and `Side O' the Road' add to this feeling, not to mention flawless blues covers `Cotton Fields' and `The Midnight Special,' but Fogerty had deeper things in mind; the group rips through `It Came Out of the Sky,' a rollicking fictional spoof on the mayhem of politics, with references to a mindless Hollywood, a story-hungry media, and Ronald Reagan (or \\"Ronnie the Popular\\" as he is called here). But `Don't Look Now (It Ain't You Or Me)' is much more serious, a poetic and frank series of questions posed to a generation, with Fogerty asking \\"Who'll make the promise that you don't have to keep?\\" and sadly concluding \\"It ain't you or me.\\" The album's most famous song, `Fortunate Son' is a testament to the band's unlikely rise to acclaim; it's ironic that one of the best attacks on the draft did not come from a group of hippies, but from a band that embraced an image of blue-collar bayou boys. The album's closer, the unjustly overlooked `Effigy' rings doom and despair, a portrait of the turmoil in America in the 60s, but can apply even to today's dire outlook.<br />When their previous album \\"Green River\\" established them as a successful singles act, critics probably thought there was no way Creedence could top it; but to their pleasant surprise, \\"Willy and the Poor Boys\\" took care of that job, but it would surely not be the end; the next year's \\"Cosmo's Factory\\" would be even more successful, proving a band could go against the grain and keep themselves creative and original.`Fortunate Son' is a testament to the band's unlikely rise to acclaim; it's ironic that one of the best attacks on the draft did not come from a group of hippies, but from a band that embraced an image of blue-collar bayou boys.

6304539258|5.0|\\"Remember, \\"The Force\\" will be with you, always...\\"<br />- Obi-Wan Kenobi reassures, Death Star killer, Luke Skywalker to keep the faith in \\"Star Wars\\".<br />George Lucas' sci-fi masterpiece, \\"Star Wars\\" changed the face of filmmaking forever, inspired future directors, and still, after two and a half decades, still generates legions of fans (I'm still a fan, since 9/77).<br />After his Uncle Owen buys two new droids (short for android), Artoo Detoo & See Threepio, young farmboy Luke Skywalker stumbles across a coded message of a beautiful girl hidden in Artoo's memory banks while cleaning him (\\"Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.\\"). Luke doesn't know who the girl is, but, who she refers to in the message might refer to an old wizard/hermit that lives beyond the \\"Dune Sea\\". Luke and the droids go in search of the old man & find him after having a savage run in with the local scavengers. Luke finds out that the old man is indeed Obi-Wan Kenobi and informs Luke that he's also a Jedi Knight and fought alongside Luke's dad in the Clone Wars, as a General.<br />Artoo replays the message for Obi-Wan. The message is actually a desperate plea for help from Princess Leia Organa of the planet Aldreaan. Her message states the Galactic Empire, led by the sinister Sith Lord & former apprentice failure of Obi-Wan's, Darth Vader, has a secret weapon called The Death Star (a space station that can destroy an entire planet) that is ready for use, & can bring great upheaval to the galaxy, certain victory for the evil Empire & certain death to the small band of rebels trying to restore freedom amongst the galaxy. However, stored in Artoo's memory banks are the schematic plans to the Death Star, that contains a major weakness that ultimately can destroy the station. Kenobi's mission is to bring the R2 unit to her father, Senator Organa, on Alderaan so the plans can be secretly delivered to the rebels. Unfortunately, Vader finds out about the missing droids (\\"Star Wars\\" opens with the memorable and spectacular space battle above Luke's homeworld of Tatooine with Artoo & Threepio escaping there captured vessel and landing on the planet) and sends hundreds of Imperial Stormtroopers to search for them. The Troopers follow the tracks and inevitably follow them to Luke's homestead (Luke returns home to find the homestead burnt to the ground and the charred remains of his aunt and uncle). Luke, now an Imperial fugitive, decides to help Obi-Wan and to be trained in the ways of the Jedi & The Force, just like his father. The boys head to the local spaceport and book passage with Han Solo, Captain of The Millenium Falcon & his Wookie co-pilot, Chewbacca.<br />But, upon arrival to Alderaan the crew finds out that the planet is the first victim of The Death Star & Alderaan is reduced to nothing more than a meteor shower. The Millenium Falcon is then caught in a tractor beam by The Death Star and is pulled into the massive space station. Through some slick manuevering, the boys go undetected by the Imperial Forces and find out that in order to escape the battle station, the tractor beam needs to be shutdown. Obi-Wan volunteers to shutdown the energy beam at its source, while Luke, Han, Chewie, and the droids remain behind. That plan falls apart as Artoo discovers that Princess Leia is on board, being held as a prisoner with a stay of execution. Luke convinces Han, & Chewie to rescue the endangered princess while the droids stay behind awaiting Obi-Wan's return. The rescue is a success, but, Obi-Wan's past catches up with him as Darth Vader tracks him down through usage of The Force and through, the now legendary, lighsabre duel (a trademark in every \\"Star Wars\\" film) Obi-Wan Kenobi falls (and becomes one with The Force) by Darth Vader's blade. The boys with Princess Leia all meet up on board The Millenium Falcon and blast off from The Death Star. Unfortunately, a homing beacon is secretly stored on board the Falcon and leads the battle station to therebel's hidden fortress.

B00006879E|5.0|I must say, recently I think twice before buying CDs just for a couple good songs.  I'm glad I didn't back out of this one, this album is truly a treasure trove.<br />While recently the songs becoming the most popular are This Love and Harder to Breath, none on this album should be overlooked.  The group is truly talented, and the music is wonderful, and each song is unique creating a very rich and interesting listening experience.<br />The group itself is amazing, the level of depth in their songs is phenomenal.  Not only do they have the voices and the lyrics of a great band, but they also have the style, the musicality, the instrumentalism... I could go on for a while.  The way in which each song is composed and put together creates a product of the highest level, one which is not only catchy but thoroghly involving.<br />Adding to this is the group's wide range of musical genre's, everything from hip hop, to rock, to funk... This creates a unique type of sound which is sure to become this group's signature (in addition to appealing to many types of audiences).<br />The bottom line: Its different from almost anything out there, but in this case its a true find.  You will almost definately not be disappointed.

0698119347|5.0|I don't remember how I got hooked on the Alex Rider Adventure books, but I'm glad I did. Alex is an unusual fourteen-year-old with many skills: he is fluent in French, Spanish, and German...has the ability to drive a Quad...a Blackbelt in karate...can play snooker like Minnesota Fats plays pool...and has a nose for danger...AND a sense of humor! He usually finds himself up against the wealthiest, nastiest, cold-blooded villains this side of James Bond. Alex is also the youngest special agent MI6 (British Intelligence) has ever had. Put all that and more in a fast-paced, action-packed, page-turner of a novel and you can't lose. Mr. Horowitz has developed a likeable and interesting hero. I hope he continues writing more of these wonderful books. I think adults would enjoy reading about Alex, too.
B000002GBB|5.0|By the time Pieces of Eight was released, Styx had established themselves as a successful rock band.  The lyrical material on songs such as \\"Great White Hope\\" and \\"Pieces of Eight\\" reflect their reaction to becoming such a major force in popular music.<BR>\\"Hope\\" opens the album with a DeYoung soliloquy reminiscent of that in \\"Superstars\\" (from The Grand Illusion album).  Then the guitars kick in for one of JY's best Styx efforts.  This song also demonstrates the musicality of Styx that they are so often accused of not having.  How many listeners out there have ever noticed that the synthesizer solo portion of this song is in 5/4?  Just as Dennis' \\"Fooling Yourself\\" solo sneaked past us in 7/4 without sounding unusual, the use of an odd time signature by the band is done here with taste and musicality.  When Rush plays a song in 7, it's great, but it's also obvious.  When Styx does it, you just keep on tapping your foot.<BR>\\"I'm O.K.\\" contains what is, in this reviewer's opinion, one of Tommy's most beautiful guitar solos (as does \\"Pieces of Eight\\").  The difference in guitar soloing styles is obvious on this album - Tommy's solos are typically more melodic, while JY's tend to be more furious and riff-based (perfect, by the way, for \\"Queen of Spades\\").  \\"I'm O.K.\\" is also the first time since the Wooden Nickel days of Styx that Dennis cranks out a genuine pipe organ solo.  Very cool.<BR>\\"Sing for the Day\\" is a fine song by Tommy, and was released as a single somewhat successfully.  It's a bit of a tension reliever, providing an acoustic break from the album's hard rock tendency.<BR>\\"Lord of the Rings\\" was written by Dennis, who gave the singing chores to JY.  More proof, as I mentioned on my \\"Crystal Ball\\" review, that Dennis was a generous bandleader, and deserved the loyalty that the rest of the band has failed to give him in recent years.<BR>This album is best known for Tommy's fantastic guitar-driven songs \\"Blue Collar Man\\" and \\"Renegade,\\" and is for that reasonprobably considered the most \\"Tommy-ish\\" Styx album.  Nonetheless, \\"Pieces of Eight\\" is the show stealer here.  Combined with Tommy's instrumental follow up, \\"Aku-Aku,\\" the title track is the last epic song we would hear from the band until the morphing of \\"Half-Penny, Two-Penny\\" and \\"A.D. 1958\\" on the Paradise Theater album two years later.  I am pleased to see that \\"Pieces\\" will be included in the soon-to-be-released Styx 2 disc anthology, as it is my favorite Styx song of all time.  In terms of lyrical content as well as musical creativity, Dennis DeYoung - and Styx as a whole - never shined more brightly.  <BR>The only reason I would possibly subtract a half-star from this album, if I could do so, is that by improving as a band, Styx lost a bit of the edge that a hungry band has - that edge that the \\"Crystal Ball\\" album contained.  I'd call the two albums equally good for different reasons.
B0009S4IKQ|4.0|[updated 2009. The VCR edition mentioned below is well out-dated by now. That tape was played on the kind of premium VCR not available today. Obviously the DVD plays far better on today's gear than an aging tape played on the kind of tin-can Walmart Wonder that is laughingly sold as a \\"VCR\\". So I must upgrade my original 3-star rating to 4 stars, considering how times have changed.] The extra features on this DVD edition are highly desirable -- get the DVD for the features, but get a recent (still factory-sealed) VHS tape for a better print.  The DVD release is so grainy it's fuzzy and often seems out-of-focus. Contrast is murky in many scenes.  In one specific scene: when Joan Crawford enters a dark room and discovers Beery standing over the baron's corpse; the grim heaviness of the textures and depth of shadows, the stark horror on Crawford's face -- these are lost in the fuzzy grain of the DVD but are clearly preserved on VHS.  Having seen this film many times on the big screen and on tape, it appears that the DVD seriously lacks the smooth, almost lush visual quality of earlier issues.  This is also one of those old-line films that looks gorgeous on a big theater screen but suffers dramatically on smaller devices. Despite the shortcomings of the DVD, this is still the grande ol' Grand Hotel of yore, a relic (but a magnificent one) of late Victorian melodrama. And dig Rachmaninoff in the background during Garbo's scenes! But I'd still advise the VHS tape if you want the rich graphics of the original.  It also appears that the master for this transfer, whatever its source, has visible physical defects that I don't see on earlier tapes.  The 2-channel DVD sound is not representative of the weighty mono original, has a clearly audible hiss and too much treble.  The sexy undertone of Garbo's voice is missing here, as is J. Barrymore's dramatic baritone (Compare scene 8 on the DVD when John Barrymore mutters \\"I don't like your tone\\", with the VHS version -- audibly, the sound of that line on the tape is more darkly effective).  The look and sound of the DVD fail to convey the unique, all-important \\"deco\\" qualities that somehow add so much to the original film's overall effect.  I'd suggest that the VHS edition is something most classic movie fans will appreciate more than they would the DVD.  An aside: originally, Garbo didn't want to share star honors with Crawford out of fear that Crawford would diminish Garbo's role.  Garbo was partially correct: Crawford steals the show. But Garbo is still a sight to behold.
B000002GB4|5.0|Crystal Ball is the second in a run of four Styx albums (Starting with \\"Equinox\\" and ending with \\"Pieces of Eight\\") that I think represents their most creative and cohesive efforts.<BR>It was the first album to include Tommy Shaw, who wrote the title song (the fact that his tune was given this honor serves to disprove the recent allegations that Dennis DeYoung was a power monger, by the way).  <BR>The album is exciting because it balances the remaining rawness and hunger of the struggling band with the powerhouse rock force that it would soon become.  <BR>Unique features of this album include: JY's extensive use of the \\"wah effect\\" on guitar solos, most notably during \\"Jennifer.\\"  This served to give the album a bit of a psychedelic feel, as does the song's dreamy ending.<BR>On the rocker \\"Shooz,\\" Styx proved that they were capable of living up to Chicago's blues reputation, and Tommy's use of the slide on his guitar is a feature I can't recall on other Styx songs.  <BR>While \\"Ball\\" used to be one of my favorite Styx songs, it ends with a somewhat weak fade out, though the lead solo is nice.<BR>\\"This Old Man\\" is a beautiful song - an apparent tribute to DeYoung's father.  While once again the fadeout is a bit extensive here, it provides a solid transition to \\"Claire de Lune/Ballerina.\\"  This piece concludes the album, and is as worthy of that task as \\"Suite Madame Blue\\" was on the previous record.  \\"Ballerina\\" is a Styx epic in the vein of \\"Suite\\" and \\"Come Sail Away\\" (which was released on the next record).  The transition from piano ballad to guitar-driven rocker is seamless, and the solos traded between JY and Tommy at the end both complement and compete with each other.  <BR>All in all, I'd have given it a 4.5, but since that's not an option, I rounded up.  Good job, Styx!
B000006TRV|5.0|This is by far one of (possibly THE) best albums ever made.This is a masterpiece in every respect.There are the classic rock songs such as &quot;Hey You&quot;,&quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;,and &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;.But there are also others,such as &quot;The Trial&quot; which has an orchestra.This cd will amaze any who will take the time to listen and analyze beyond the surface.Go out and buy it now!
B00005N91B|3.0|It's hilarious how worked up people got when this movie came out. The PC crowd decried the fact that a lesbian was the killer and, therefore, must have been the villan. The right wing crowd then immediately accused the PC crowd of being too hysterical about the alleged prejudice against homosexuals. Basic Instinct, they contended, was bad because it was a dirty movie. The producers, of course, loved all this publicity because EVERYONE went running to see the move and, in the words of Liberace, cried all the way to the bank. Telling audiences to not see a film because of homosexual activity and graphic sex scenes is like trying to scare ants away from a picnic by pouring sugar on the ground.<br />First of all, Sharon Stone's Catherine Trammell who is the killer lesbian (actually bisexual) in question, IS THE MOST SYMPATHETIC character in the whole film! EVERYONE is a slimebag! From Michael Douglas' hot tempered, tourist killing, chain smoking, cocaine snorting, oversexed police detective to Jeanne Tripplehorn's neurotic, kinky police psychiastrist who is more messed up than any of her patients to the rest of the morally compromised sleazes who pass for cops who laugh at murder victims and have the compassion and sensitivity of storm troopers, EVERY single character in this movie is a cesspool of a person! The way I see it, Sharon Stone is the most sympathetic person in the entire film -- at least she makes no bones about being sleazy. If you take the position that lesbians should be offended by their negative portrayal in Basic Instinct, then you could say the same for psychiatrists, cops (especially members of the SFPD), mystery writers, drug addicts, San Franciscans, smokers, country/western fans, chilli eaters, Mustang drivers and basically all human beings in general.<br />Of course, the right wing is just as clueless when it comes to Basic Instinct. I went to see Basic Instinct BECAUSE of all the sex in the movie! Anyone who tells you that they saw Basic Instinct for any reason other than to see loads of nudity and sex is so full of it, they should be slapped! I went to see Sharon Stone's nether regions in the police interrogation scene. I went to see the sex scene between Douglas and Stone that seems to go on for about half the movie (although I had to wait until the home video release to see ALL of the sex scene -- what a rip-off!). I went to see Sharon Stone display the wares she only hinted at having in Total Recall. I WANTED TO SEE SEX AND NUDITY AND, BY GOD, THAT'S WHY I WENT TO SEE BASIC INSTINCT!!! So many hypocritical prudes tsk tsk at all of the sex in movies today. Get a clue! This movie is like a huge bug zapper: drawing us in with loads of sex and nudity even though we're going to get zapped when we realize what a piece of sleazy trash we're watching (Joe Ezsterhaus must read tons of pornography in order to form his views of women).<br />But please don't get me wrong, this is INSPIRED sleaze that I am wholeheartedly recommending you at least rent, if not purchase. It may be sleaze, but it's really, really enjoyable sleaze which will have you \\"standing at attention\\" for a long, long time afterward (even after you see not one, but two, gratuitous shots of Michael Douglas' butt). And for those of you who have moral objections to Basic Instinct, please, go out and get a life!
B00003CXCT|5.0|No offense Mr. Lucas, but the new episodes just don't come anywhere near the quality of the origional three.<br />The origional trilogy is an exceptional piece of work.  If you haven't seen it yet then you are really missing something.  You don't have to be an uber geek to enjoy then either.
B0000JCFPE|3.0|It's hilarious how worked up people got when this movie came out. The PC crowd decried the fact that a lesbian was the killer and, therefore, must have been the villan. The right wing crowd then immediately accused the PC crowd of being too hysterical about the alleged prejudice against homosexuals. Basic Instinct, they contended, was bad because it was a dirty movie. The producers, of course, loved all this publicity because EVERYONE went running to see the move and, in the words of Liberace, cried all the way to the bank. Telling audiences to not see a film because of homosexual activity and graphic sex scenes is like trying to scare ants away from a picnic by pouring sugar on the ground.<br />First of all, Sharon Stone's Catherine Trammell who is the killer lesbian (actually bisexual) in question, IS THE MOST SYMPATHETIC character in the whole film! EVERYONE is a slimebag! From Michael Douglas' hot tempered, tourist killing, chain smoking, cocaine snorting, oversexed police detective to Jeanne Tripplehorn's neurotic, kinky police psychiastrist who is more messed up than any of her patients to the rest of the morally compromised sleazes who pass for cops who laugh at murder victims and have the compassion and sensitivity of storm troopers, EVERY single character in this movie is a cesspool of a person! The way I see it, Sharon Stone is the most sympathetic person in the entire film -- at least she makes no bones about being sleazy. If you take the position that lesbians should be offended by their negative portrayal in Basic Instinct, then you could say the same for psychiatrists, cops (especially members of the SFPD), mystery writers, drug addicts, San Franciscans, smokers, country/western fans, chilli eaters, Mustang drivers and basically all human beings in general.<br />Of course, the right wing is just as clueless when it comes to Basic Instinct. I went to see Basic Instinct BECAUSE of all the sex in the movie! Anyone who tells you that they saw Basic Instinct for any reason other than to see loads of nudity and sex is so full of it, they should be slapped! I went to see Sharon Stone's nether regions in the police interrogation scene. I went to see the sex scene between Douglas and Stone that seems to go on for about half the movie (although I had to wait until the home video release to see ALL of the sex scene -- what a rip-off!). I went to see Sharon Stone display the wares she only hinted at having in Total Recall. I WANTED TO SEE SEX AND NUDITY AND, BY GOD, THAT'S WHY I WENT TO SEE BASIC INSTINCT!!! So many hypocritical prudes tsk tsk at all of the sex in movies today. Get a clue! This movie is like a huge bug zapper: drawing us in with loads of sex and nudity even though we're going to get zapped when we realize what a piece of sleazy trash we're watching (Joe Ezsterhaus must read tons of pornography in order to form his views of women).<br />But please don't get me wrong, this is INSPIRED sleaze that I am wholeheartedly recommending you at least rent, if not purchase.

B000003TA4|1.0|I know I will catch hell from Nirvana and Kurt Cobain fans, but let's face it, Nirvana wasn't the greatest band in the world. Granted, they had some great songs on their albums, even this one, but they aren't life changing. I really don't mind this album or Nirvana. I do mind the influence it made on popular music. Every nu-metal band now sounds like Nevermind. Every 21-year-old backward-cap-wearing rap-rock idiot says that they're influenced by Kurt Cobain (not really). And of course, there are the thousands of 14-year-olds who said that this album prevented them from commiting suicide. What I have to say is, BullS$$t. In reality, Nirvana was just another band from Seattle that somehow got famous because they had the word &quot;teen&quot; in one of their songs.<br />The fact is that there were a lot of bands doing this kind of music at the time. The Pixies come to mind. In fact, Smells Like Teen Spirit was basically ripping off The Pixies' Debaser.<br />Also, The Melvins come to mind too. A lot of the guitar tone off this album came from Bullhead and Stoner Witch.<br />Nirvana isn't really a bad band. In fact, I really like Bleach and In Utero. It's just too bad that the crappy record gets the most fame. If you want to get into Nirvana, please, try the other two albums.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|i'm shocked at the way ppl approach in the zone. i really don;t think it deserves so many one-star reviews. i mean here are ppl suggesting Britney Spears music fans to listen to Radiohead and nine inch nails. Seriously, what kind of suggestion is that??<BR>My suggestion is to buy it if you are a pop/rnb fan or if you are an old Britney fan. Rock fans should really stay away from the CD and this review board. I'm quite sure fans of Norah Jones and Celine Dion, Nelly Furtado etc.. should keep away from this too and stop posting pointless one-star reviews for cheap pleasures.
B00009W0U4|1.0|I found this film difficult to watch.  This was not because of the violence, unpleasant though it is, but because in nearly every respect the film fails.  The camera work in the early stages is simply irritating and pretentious.  The continual girations of the camera creating visual frustration rather than conveying a mood, which is presumably the intention.  By telling the story in reverse you know all you are interested in knowing about the characters (who I found uninteresting) and the plot 2/3 of the way through the film thus making the final 1/3 tedious.  It comes across as a film student's attempt to make a controversial film.
B000000JO3|5.0|OK, you probably already have this CD since it is one of the best CDs ever in the history of the music genre known as punk, and if you don't have it, GET IT NOW! You need this now or you are a bloody poseur! ha just kidding. But it's a good CD, check it out. I think Ian Mackaye is a great singer.
0060934913|5.0|This book recapitulates the life of Anthony Bourdain, a New York City chef.  Bourdain describes how he decided to become a chef, and his training, from washing dishes for a Provincetown surf-and-turf, to studying at the Culinary Institute of America, to boot camp with Bigfoot, an unnamed New York City restaurateur from whom he learned how to survive in the big leagues.  He introduces us to the backrooms of a busy restaurant kitchen, where we meet the people who prepare the fabulous food, learn about their tools and slang, and begin to get an inkling about the daily responsibilities of a head chef.<br />Thanks to his French heritage, Bourdain had learned to appreciate superb food as a youngster, and his parents had the resources to send him to any college he chose.  Bourdain, however, likes to live on the edge, and his desire to live life to the fullest and push the limits soon led to multiple drug dependencies and heavy alcohol usage that kept steady employment difficult to maintain for a time.  Remarkably, though not detailed exactly how in this book, Bourdain managed to beat his addictions, and has gone on to become not only a talented executive chef, but also a successful novelist and writer in his spare time. How anyone could even find spare time in a chef's life as he describes it is unfathomable- -Bourdain obviously  thrives on stress and challenges.<br />The pace of the book is relentless- -it's one of those volumes that you can race through in a single day, not allowing anyone to interrupt you.  Bourdain's language is not for everyone though- -he accurately records the words that are said behind the kitchen doors, so if you are squeamish about sex or take offense easily, this book is not for you.<br />This book confirms the importance of knowing who is cooking your food.  After all, food is something you put inside your body, so it is a real act of trust to consume something that someone else has prepared.  It's remarkable that many people are quite content to let total strangers prepare their food.  Why would  anyone frequent fast food restaurants where most of the cooks are teenagers with no talent or interest in food preparation, doing it all for minimum wage?  At least in kitchens like Bourdain's, although some of the cooks may be oversexed drug addicts with filthy mouths, only those who can consistently achieve high cooking standards manage to stay on.  Bourdain also reminds us to use our heads when placing our orders.  After all, when you tell the waiter what you want, the food isn't just going to appear on the plate out of thin air when the cook snaps his fingers.  If the fish market isn't open on the weekend, then Monday isn't a great day for ordering fish.  Today's luncheon special may indeed contain leftovers from last night's menu.  Some items take longer than others to prepare- -hence shouldn't be ordered at five minutes before closing.  This book provides a fascinating perspective on what it's like to study at the CIA, how an executive chef spends his time, and what may be happening behind those closed doors at your favorite restaurant.t to let total strangers prepare their food.

0385336810|5.0|I bought this book last night I finished reading it just a few hours later. It tells the story of how the white lies of Emma's life have defined all of her relationships. She's a twenty-something who has struggled to find her way in the last few years and tries to make her relationships with others smoother by telling them mostly what they want to hear, all the while not she's not happy. On a bumpy flight home from a bumpy business meeting, she tells all of the secrets she's been keeping from everyone to a complete stranger confident that she'll never see him again. Only, it doesn't quite work out that way...<br />I loved this book! As a twenty-something who's going through my own bumpy life, I completely identified with Emma and loved her to pieces. I think Ms. Kinsella's writing style and storylines have improved so much over the Shopaholic series (which I loved) and it allowed me to enjoy all of the characters. It's very similar to the Shopaholic books as it addresses the need for honesty in all relationships in order to be happy but at the same time taking in to consideration the needs of the other people we interact with in our lives. I found myself laughing out loud at many points and crying at several as well. Chaucer this book is not, but it IS a standout in a world cluttered with mediocre chick lit
B00003CXCT|2.0|I miss Star Wars.  I miss Han shooting Greedo first, I miss Luke not screaming in fear as he falls, I miss the lack of crappy Jabba SFX's. I miss that as bad as the dialog was the actors where charismatic enough to pull it off, with no Jake Lloyds, Hayden Christensons or Jar Jar Binks to ruin it.  I miss Muppets as characters and stop motions effects.  <br />The Original Star Wars movies had an energy and life that George Lucas has killed with his reworked \\"Special\\" Editions.  <br />The fact that he has declared that the original versions are dead and to never be released on DVD reveals his true spite and hatred for the fans that have built his empire.<br />So I for one am BOYCOTTING these DVD's.  I am a life long fan of Star Wars, and as such am staying loyal to the one true vision of it I know.  No Special Editions, No prequels. I can only hope others do the same.<br />I Love Star Wars, and to see it so plainly evident that George Lucas does not brings a great saddness to my heart.<br />At least he didn't replace the Storm Trooper's blasters with walkie talkies.
6302994063|5.0|When I started dance classes in 1992, I was probably one of the gawkiest, most unconfident little dancers you would have ever seen......chubby, shy, not very well-coordinated.  You know how tough it can be to be ten years old!  Anyway, the year was 1993, and I went to see a film called STRICTLY BALLROOM, that had just been released at a local art house movie house.  Not many people had even heard of it, let alone of the director, Baz Luhrmann.  It was a small film about ballroom dancing, of all things...and a comedy!  All I knew was I always enjoyed watching ballroom dancing on PBS, and dreamed about being slender, graceful and perfectly tan!  Just like all of those competitive dancers I saw.  This film was probably one of the best tonics I needed.  The storyline is about Scott Hastings (Paul Mercurio), a young man who has grown up with the dancing gene ever since he could remember.  He even started competing in ballroom (modern and latin) since the age of six.  He truly had the ultimate &quot;stage mother&quot; mum forcing him to stick to the moves (and the partners) that will get him the ultimate in coveted honors in the Ballroom dancing community--first prize at the PAN PACIFICS.  His partners are all the same: blonde, busty and bossy.  Also, divas with a capital &quot;D.&quot;  Scott upsets and shocks the ballroom dance community with his &quot;crowd pleasing&quot; steps during one of the performances, which leads to an immediate and messy break-up between him and his current partner, Liz (Gia Carides).  Scott does not want to give up on his original footwork, and stubbornly practices his spins, jumps and twirls, completely unaware that Fran (Tara Morice), the beginning dancer and ultimate &quot;ugly duckling&quot; from his mother's dancing studio is watching him in admiration.  Fran longs to break free of the &quot;beginning dancers&quot; mold, and team up with someone like Scott who has the guts to challenge the authority of the traditional dance steps drilled into him through years of rigourous training.  She also has some spicy moves of her own--being of Spanish extraction, with a background in flamenco.<br />This film is a real confidence booster for anyone who felt awkward on the dance floor.  It is also great fun for people who need an attitude booster, and want to see a really wonderfully crafted, quirky, low-budget Aussie comedy.  This debut by Baz Luhrmann is delightfully unaffected, and beautifully done.  Guaranteed to have you dancing in the aisles...and, in spite of what you might think, this has the potential to be a great date film.  That's right, fellas....though it has &quot;chick flick&quot; written all over it in the title alone, you might find yourself having fun, too!<br />Don't miss this treat.into him through years of rigourous training.

B0000CFW87|5.0|I absolutely adore Josh because of his style, his voice, and his honesty. The passion he pours into his songs are so touching, and even without knowing a lot of Italian, Spanish, or French, the emotion is translated through his voice, the instrumentation, and the overall composition of the song. <br />Listening to Mi Mancherai is such an experience. The violin duet with Joshua Bell is such a great match. The two amazing talents make such an incredible duet. The violin alone moved me to tears. To add Josh's voice to that, made Mi Mancherai (translated, I will miss you) my favourite song on the album. Seeing Lucia perform this on stage with Josh is an experience in itself. It's just amazing.<br />Remember When It Rained is a very eerie but interesting song. The piano solo (of course performed by Josh himself) in the middle kind of caught me off guard, but I grew to like it much more with another listen. Overall, this song is just great!<br />You Raise Me Up is another favourite. The versatility of the song made it such a great hit with the general public, and is probably the driving force for people to buy the CD. It's such an inspirational piece that made me cry quite a few times, thinking of what the song meant to me. This song really relates to everyone who is loved and loves another.<br />Oceano is another haunting song. This was my immediate favourite, because of the tempo, the rhythms, and the overall feel of the whole vibe it brings. It's relaxing, and it's driving all at once. I really enjoy this one.<br />Overall, this CD is a staple in my collection. It's different from his first album, but in a good way. &quot;Closer&quot; does bring us closer to Josh's musical tastes, and it adds different flavours in different places, which is very refreshing from albums that are so consistantly repeating almost the same song over and over again. Buy Closer, Internet Version if you want four extra songs (Mi Morena, She's Out of My Life, You're the Only Place, and My December) and the DVD that comes with the other version they put out with the two extra songs... You won't regret it! I love this man, and I love this album!!!
B00005JMEW|1.0|Why anyone would waste their money purchasing this movie is beyond me.  The concept of a female assasin is not an acceptable excuse for gratuitous violence.  Don't we have enough in the world already?  Quentin Tarrantino has certainly done it again.  This man obviously has a passion for morbid violence and evil.  This film is yet another example of how the public is seduced by violence if it is package in a slick sophisticated manner.  Don't be fooled!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|When you spend your hard earned money you want to get everything from it. Well I purchased Wrestlemania XX along with three of my frineds and I have to say that I was extremely surprised. When you watch events on tv they have to be alot more careful then they had to at Wrestlemania you can just tell. On Raw or Smackdown their only allowed to punch with their opened so it really doesn't do much and very so often do they ever break eachother open unless it's a Kane match or Shawn Michaels match. Well to the DVD this is a great event to buy because it has 3 DVD's filled with bonus features and Wrestlemania XX Where It All Begins Again event. When I purchased the event I wanted to see all my favorite superstars win but almost none did. But I still enjoyed it. All the superstars put their full effort into their match and you can tell they did. Every match was great besides the Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar match. Goldberg is just a wimp. He was afraid of facing Kane so that fued lasted like 3 weeks and he was afraid of facing Brock Lesnar so this match just sucked. Brock just wanted to get going in the match but Goldberg kept running from side to side. I swear the Jackhammer is the dumbest move I have ever seen. A suplex into a side slam oh my God that is going to just bust you in half. Anyways yeah the match sucked but that was really the only one.
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down in my opinion is the greatest war movie ever made, with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN following close behind. The actual events that happened that day were portrayed greatly by director Ridley Scott with superb acting by  Josh Hartnett, Tom Siezmore, and Eric Bana. This movie is very realisticly graphic with tons of violence. Black Hawk Down is a great movie about those heroic men who put their lives on the line for innocent somalians. DONT MISS IT!!!
6304331851|2.0|Is it that eleven songs are two few for a three-hour movie musical or does this only seem so wordy because Richard Harris as King Arthur, mostly, and Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Guinevere, to a significant extent, talk their songs? Do they talk their songs because neither one can really sing? (Franco Nero, as Sir Lancelot, is dubbed-in.) Is it also because none of the three principals can really sing that they spend all their moments on screen furiously gesticulating, by way of compensation? (I remember thinking, &quot;If Nero nods his head once more, I'm going to slap him.&quot; He was not deterred.) Regrave tries so very hard to look cute; Nero tries so very hard to look earnest; Harris seems to think he's acting a Shakespearian tragedy, bellowing banal bits of dialogue that can't bear the strain--as he hops about the stage. (He's wearing far too much eye make-up, by the way. He looks like a man in drag.) The singing is awful, and the acting is obnoxious and smarmy. Alan Jay Lerner's screenplay adaptation is riddled with holes. Director Joshua Logan thinks every other song needs to be adorned with MTV-like relentlessly spliced footage.<br />See the play, listen to the Broadway cast album, or read the score. Just forget this movie.
0345409671|2.0|Tale of the Body Thief, Anne Rice's fourth book that came out before this one, was one of my personal favorites by Anne and I never thought that one day I would rate one of her novels below at least a four- oh but this one that I pounced on immediately after I read Tale of the Body Theif the fifth time, threw me off that light little cloud of opinion completly.  This book was simply too religious for me. It confused me utterly and even Anne made Lestat tell us in one scene if we were still did not understand, then go back and read the scene over again, which I found was a hilarious thing to do because it seemed she just branded her own book confusing. But really, the novel was just way too religious. I know that's what the entire book was to be about, but still, Anne has to remember she is supposed to be writing about her vampires the most, not her own personal opinions on life after death. Honestly I don't know why she wrote such a story in the first place though, I guess it really was just to shock her viewers with this weird new plot.  Mainly this book is about Lestat, the star character of the entire Vamprie Chronicles, and again like in all the Chronicles besides Interview, you see what happens through his eyes as he takes us on quite a trip I found out. What happens is that Lestat is being stalked by this man who soon presents himself to Lestat as Memnoch, a.k.a. the devil. Throughout this entire story from then on the devil mainly tells his story to Lestat as he takes him on a personal voyage through both heaven and hell. I must advise everyone though not to take offense to Anne's writing religious- wise, because one of my friends were. This is just her opinion of what the afterlife is like, she doesn't mean to say her's is the right idea of things. This is just how she sees it. But I am irratated at this sudden profound discussion of religion. Sure Anne makes religion a slight stroke in all her stories, but only slight. This went much more deeper than a slight stroke. When I first read this, I worried severely what she was doing exactly. I mean, was she going all holy on her writing or something? Luckily the Vampire Armand came out and I loved it dearly, and Marius's, Armand's Maker's novel wasn't bad either, but I felt something was lost then from Anne after Memnoch. I'm not really sure what, but none of Anne's novels after Memnoch had the same feeling I once felt with her first four novels. For one reason Lestat never was really the same ever again after Memnoch, for awhile he wasn't even physically moving as will be told from Armand's novel. And when he finally does start to move again which he does, he's a changed man, and that's not in a good way.  So my advice is if you can stand a theme that surrounds Anne's views on religion,and have the patience for a book you sometimes can get a bit lost in, then go on and read it. But it's not really based on anything vampiric but Lestat himself being the star character, following the supposed devil around and listening to his story like some sort of Interview with the Vamprie replica.  In my opinion, Blackwood Farm, a book written way into the future from when Memnoch was written, was the final ring in my opinion that proved the Chronicles were expiring from the once much loved excitement it carried. Memnoch was the first warning years before that we Chronicle followers didn't heed out of hope that more books would come after that matched such excitement of her first four novels.   But out of all of this, I will say one thing: All of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles are worth reading once. So I do recommend this, just for a mere observation.
B00006JKOL|2.0|I'm inclined to think Ian Anderson had more charisma and youthful vitality than he ever had talent (and a bit of early luck, as well; some things, like \\"Aqualung\\", for example, just fell together). That's as may be, but this here particular recording is clearly flash without substance, and haphazard and careless to boot. Aside from the flash-without-substance, quite a bit of its hell is in the details (details perverse, details overlooked). I could go on all the day about that except I've other things to do. One little bit (among many others) that bugs me, however:<br />The third song-let in the medley-sort-of-thing called \\"Baker Street Muse\\", which is, as noted by another, one phrase repeated six times (with only an intimation of relief once, I think), uses a slow trill-like melismatic figure for some repetitions, and in other repetitions its same music is set syllabically. That inconsistency just KILLS this song-let (or would have, if its nearly unrelieved repetition hadn't already, and its lyric weren't over-written and opaque).
B00008S2VG|5.0|Yes... if you analize things this album is grossly overlooked......just like EROTICA<br />But this is my favourite Madonna album. I also love every track on it....<br />The remixes were amazing as well<br />It will be the most underrated thing of her career, but it's still a parfect album.
B000002AH1|5.0|This is probably among the best of Miles electric - heavy, funky, incredible.  Corea, McLaughlin, etc are astounding and Miles ripping wah-wah will send chills to the core of your soul.<br />He really did have the world's baddest rock band - this is Exhibit B (...)
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Is it hopelessly fluffy? Yes. Is it cheesy in some places? Yes. Is it a bit cliched at times? Yes. But then it is also a wonderfully acted, touching movie. <br />Some people have complained that one of the storylines involves adultery, but I think that that storyline is probably one of the best. The emotions are realistic and very well portrayed, especially by Emma Thompson as the wife.<br />Yes, I think that the romance with the porn stars could have been cut out, but I also feel that you shouldn't forego the whole movie because of that one plot line. If it offends you, skip it. The rest of the movie is definitely worth watching. <br />Not all of the plot lines have the perfect Hollywood ending, either. Some of the people that you want to end up together may not, and I think that that also adds to the realistic quality of this film.<br />There are a lot of plot lines, and it's not the kind of movie that you can follow if you're only half paying attention, but the plot lines flow nicely together, so it's really not that difficult to follow, and all the plot lines are actually interrelated, as you find out through interactions between the various characters.<br />All in all, this is a sweet, feel-good movie. Yes, it's cheesy at times, but at the heart of it, it has a good message: Love really is all around us, in many different forms. And I think that this is a message that everyone needs to hear and remember.
B00005RJ1U|4.0|I haven't seen a good movie like this in a while. I really enjoy scary movies, and this one had me on the edge of my seat!  That human eating thing, whatever it was, was of the hook.  Lord knows, I was thinking about it after the movie was off.  It had me shooked for a min. LOL
B000001GPX|4.0|I bought this because it was supposed to be an essential recording but it didn't make an impression. My favorite still remains Fritz Reiner's with the Chicago Symphony.  I have a version with Karajan (not very good), another with Klemperer (good).  I had a version with Kleiberth's father (I think) on LP that I preffered. I will also try the version with Leibowitz conducting (I own the 9th and it is amazing).  I will have to listen to them first in the future
