B0070Y46UY|3.0|To me this book was just okay.  There were some parts of it that were interesting and kept me entertained.  But, for me, it kind of dragged on and on a bit too much.  I personally could have skipped the first 40 chapters and just read Part II of the book.  For me, it was hard getting through those first 40 chapters and I didn't feel they were all that relevant to the story.  Then, the end of the book was just weird for me.  I don't want to give anything away, but if I had to do it all over again, I'd only read Part II.

0553582453|5.0|Robin Hobb is as good as any fantasy/fiction writer I have ever read, and I have read some of the best including Robert Jordan and George RR Martin. She brings her characters to life and here story lines alway have a surprise and an 'aha' every few pages. This applies to the series starting with the &#34;Assassins Apprentice&#34; and into the &#34;Dragon Keepers&#34; series.<br /><br />Bravo!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Tap feature is great. Some moves however were doubled because tap moves only part of a string or moved to the wrong location.  This may be a lack of familiarity with the touch locations on my new Kindle.
1449410243|4.0|I laugh hysterically at nearly every Oatmeal strip and comic that I come across. His last book was well worth the price and continues to be a book that I give to friends and family (who I think will appreciate the sometimes...extreme...humor).<br /><br />I am a cat lover, so this book hit home at several points. Overall, though, I liked the variety in the first book better.
B007REV4YI|5.0|After not liking Quantum of Solace very much I was a bit skeptical about how this movie was going to be.  Fortunately, this is one of the best Bond films out there and an excellent movie.  I have always been a huge fan of the older Bond films.  Especially the Sean Connery ones.  What Skyfall did so well was how it blended themes from the older movies into it.  You absolutely get more out of this film if you've seen any of the first Bond films.  I highly recommend seeing this movie.

B00009P1O0|5.0|I love this album.  It is probably one of my favorite Neil Young albums of all time.  Rough and unpolished, but yet mellow and smooth.  This is one of my favorite albums to drive long distances with.  &#34;On The Beach&#34; has been there with me through some seriously scary winter mountain pass drives and it keeps me sane and mellow the whole way.  Not many albums have so many great songs all in a row like this one does.  Very good album, I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys the sounds of Neil.

B00933JF74|5.0|I cant tell if this is a sequel to &quot;Townsmen 6&quot;, as they dont call it number 7, but is a bit better. It runs perfectly on my kindle Fire. The only downside i have found is that buildings can not be upgraded, which is possible in the first one. Otherwise, the graphics are nicer, their are no restrictions on how many of each building can be built, (I have 28 houses) the other game limited you to roughly 15-20. the menus show more information, there are more types of buildings and so far a university is not required to research and unlock more advanced ones, but an example; if you want a tailor's shop, you need a weaver, for that you need a sheep pen, and prior to that you have to build a farm. I am hoping that in future updates they will make upgrading possible, but so far it doesnt look probable. If you enjoyed the first one at all, i recommend buying this one. the fun i have received from it was definitely worth the $2.60.

B00ARN0XGG|2.0|I, like so many others, am a huge fan of the PA franchise.  I love them all, have multiple copies of each release, watch them over and over, and watch anything that remotely resembles them.<br /><br />However, PA4 is a stinker. (Warning... spoilers ahead!)<br /><br />When the movie begins, we see Katie move in across the street from the focus family.  She has a little boy with her.  I assumed this was Hunter.<br /><br />He introduces himself to the kid in the focus family, Wyatt, as Robbie.  Okay, I think, he's got a new name.  I can understand that since Katie and the boy are on the lam.  Logically they wouldn't be using their real names.<br /><br />Then Katie goes into the hospital, and the kid comes to stay with the focus family.  No one questions that there could be child neglect/abuse going on with \\"Robbie\\" who, at the age of 6, is left on his own continually, wanders outside of the home at all hours of the night, never has a change of clothes, and acts, well, just downright weird.<br /><br />Then we discover that it is actually Wyatt who was adopted and is Hunter.<br /><br />Who, then, is Robbie???<br /><br />He's the same age as Hunter, so we know he couldn't be Katie's, since Hunter was over a year old when he was kidnapped, and Katie had no children of her own.<br /><br />Where did he come from?  Who does he belong to?  Why was Hunter removed from Katie's custody, and why wasn't Katie put away if she was caught kidnapping him?<br /><br />Is Robbie really a child?  We know he's not Toby, because he speaks to Toby.  Does he belong to another member of the Cult?  Why does he always wear the same clothes?  What's the deal with the socks and sandals?  The fork?  The antique stuffed animal?<br /><br />I have a sneaking suspicion the filmakers will use the formula they used for PA3 and go back in time for PA5 to reveal what happened in between 3 and 4, and give us the answer to these things.<br /><br />At least I hope they do.  And I hope it's scary.  Because PA4is NOT frightening in the least, and to me, was more aggravating and disappointing than entertaining.<br /><br />I'm very sad :(

B00ANT6OK8|5.0|Summary: The hunt for Usama Bin Laden is the modern epitome of our hunt for evil. This is the Hollywood dramatization of that story. It is gritty, but not overplayed. It is political, but not harshly partisan. It's a very good film that stays, like the protagonist, in the hunt of its target.<br /><br />Full Review: \\"The Hurt Locker\\" was one of the most intense modern war films of our era. It's director, Katherine Bigalow, is the director of \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\".  The movie is fine-tuned to present the lighting, action, and dialog of what real special ops missions are truly about. Add to that the CIA investigation and tracking of Usama bin Laden (labeled coldly as UBL throughout) and you have a convincing, engrossing and controversial movie.<br /><br />I have to admit that I saw \\"Argo\\" recently and it was hard not to think in parallels of what was being attempted with this film. But in its sheer weight, action and story \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is a clear winner. While the plot of the movie culminates in 30 minutes of action, as the operation is engaged and UBL is hunted to his death, the main narrative centers around the character Maya. She is the CIA analyst who spends her entire career hunting down UBL from her desk and gathering evidence from interviews of others in the Al Qaeda terrorist organization. Maya becomes the hero in this film, though critics have notably downplayed the role of individuals, saying there was a huge network of information and work that made the hunt successful.<br /><br />Like most based-on-reality films, \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is not a precise retrace of the exact story, but is supposedly very close to events. As a movie-goer, I am less interested in each and every detail of the hunt, but want to know the general storyline. Jessica Chastain (who plays Maya) is a unrelenting CIA agent, whose portrayal, while heroic, sometimes seems unbelievable in the professional/government world.  Her dialog with superiors feels unrealistic and might have well had her fired. Whether it is accurate to the word, I am doubtful. But the details of she helps to catches the mastermind terrorist and works to have action taken on the target- this feels vivid and real. The ensuing operation to finally take down Usama bin Laden also feels believable and is certainly engaging and human.<br /><br />But, I am guessing the big \\"talking point\\" of this film be none of those things. Likely the big controversy will be over detainee torture methods, and the film's point of its effectiveness, will be the loud screaming topic from the follow-on conversation for this film. Even if just for that, it is an excellent film to see. You will likely not leave without an opinion.<br /><br />For parents, this movie should be reserved for children that are 16 and over. While the action is haunting and violent (targets are shot to be killed, without being offered any surrender), it is the scenes of prisoner torture that are most gruesome and degrading. Parents should heed the movie's MPAA \\"R\\" rating.her fired. Whether it is accurate to the word, I am doubtful.

B002R88G4U|5.0|I wish I could read this book for the first time again! The story and setting are fascinating, the characters delightful!  That being said, the book does not disrespect what people would have gone through during this period in history. I have read it more than once and shall read it again and again.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed. Very simple. However it was an easy quick read. I bought the second one to see what happens.
B005BOHYW2|5.0|This book is beautiful. If I could afford it, I'd buy a copy for all of my book-friends. I have recommended it to every book club I know. It is beautifully written. It is melancholy, but not sentimental and hopeless. The complex characters and plot are elegantly crafted. This book became part of how I saw the world for a long time after reading it. I think of it often and wish I could read it again for the very first time.

B0015HOFZI|4.0|For a 66 year-old lady with minimal technical skills, this product presented a challenge. With patience and persistence, I was able to transfer good quality recordings of some of my old favorite vinyl records to the computer. I did have to use the Sony help and read directions closely and I did have a few ugly moments. I would point out that records will transfer BUT WILL NOT BE AUDIBLE without amplification. That took me a while to figure out. Thank you for this opportunity to give feedback.

0345803507|2.0|I read all three books, the first two were loaned to my by my sister in law and I bought a used copy of the third, otherwise I would not have spent money on them. I mostly just wanted to see what all the fuss was about and skimmed through them fairly quickly, the sex scenes were repetitive, unrealistic at times, and overall wore pretty thin, just seemed over the top juvenile fantasy most of the time. As a middle aged mom with children the age of the characters in the book I did not find anything I could relate to. Not much of a plot and most of it is predictable. The best description I can give is this might be what would have happened if we were to have the rest of the story of Pretty Woman.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Great storyline, action, no gore. Have watched it so many times over and over. I highly recommend it to everyone!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is one of the few Science Fiction books that leaves an indelible impression. I'm one of those avid readers that goes to the library to borrow a book only to get it home and realize I read it years ago. But not Wool. It was creative, original and surprising. I even found myself updating my husband (who isn't much of a reader) with what was happening with the characters as if they were friends or family. Mr. Howey makes them come alive, until the reader is immersed in their struggles; holding your breath when they can't breathe. You will find yourself recommending this book to friends, family members and any miscellaneous people you happen to talk books with (like my optometrist the other day) just as I did.  If I had only one wish regarding this book, it would be for me to be able to read it for the first time, again.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|One of those good movies with humor in it that will make the adults in the room laugh.  May be a little scary for the real young kids.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|This book is the most natural storytelling, and true narrative progressing book available. This comes from the author really knowing his characters, and knowing what actions his characters will or will not take when left in certain situations. Screen and show writers should take his heed, and stop writing shows/movies with characters that do truly unbelievable things. Highly recommend!
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|First hit I remember hearing from Halestorm is &#34;Love Bites&#34; and it just totally rocked. The hit they have out now, &#34;Miss Misery&#34; rocks also, and after getting the cd, the whole thing is great. If you're into the hard rock/heavy metal genre, Halestorm is a must have for those who love to rock out.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I had some trouble getting my volume to work with this case, but after some manipulating I got that part to work.  No matter how I tried I could never set my phone to vibrate with the case on.  The other bigger issue I had was that I sounded like I was in a closet when calling with the case on my phone and that wasn't acceptible.  I returned the case and went with another type.  I was very pleased with my ability to return the case to Amazon.
B000001FKY|5.0|I have always loved Def Leppard back from their high popularity in the 80's to today. Hysteria was a long time in the making as the band was going through their drummer, Rick Allen, recovering from a horrific car accident that resulted in him losing an arm. But Rick has continued on with his band mates thanks to the invention of an electric drum kit that allows him to continue on...and Hysteria was the first album where Rick Allen used his specialized kit. And the music was worth the wait (5 years since their last release, Pyromania, another rocking classic).
B000JML90Y|3.0|Well written but obviously biased.  Mr. Darwin researches eagerly, ignoring truth, embracing his main thesis of evolution by natural selection.  Modern day &#34;scientists&#34; poo poo this volume while doing the same.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Lego toys are a pretty safe bet and this one did not disappoint. High quality and hours of imaginative play built in. I would recommend.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is by far my favorite app.  You can mix in as many sounds as you want to, adjust each sound's volume, add in some beta waves to put you to sleep....what's not to like?  The ONLY thing that's missing is a 'foghorn' sound, although I don't really miss it with all the other good ones available.

B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book is definitely aimed at a younger audience, but does touch on some important issues that are good for all of us to stop and think about. I read this book in a few days, as I couldn't stop wondering what would happen to Hannah next.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy having this available to read, review or just look some verse up. My kids are reading it and they enjoy having it as well. They like it so much they ask to take it to church with them.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautifully written, touching, and real. I finished this book last week and am still thinking about the characters daily. I'm glad  to have read this book, and look forward to reading more from this author in the future. I only hope that Green's other novels have the same depth of character and way of making me stop, think and be impacted as I move forward.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I am okay with the app on the Kindle Fire however I perfer to check the email from the computer. I have verify who I am from place to another and have to make sure I have cell phone with me at all time for this reason. I cant update if I have emails deleted already and that frustrates me as well. I re-read the same ones.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|This is an excellent product combination and works very well.  The standard Mini-Mag flashlight is useless because there is no simple on-off switch - you must rotate the bezel to turn the light on.  The Nite Ize kit turns the Mini-Mag into a useful, practical flashlight with a very bright focused light beam.  Great product!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My kids play this game and I hear them as they play. They really enjoy it and get upset when the Kindle Fire loses the charge and they have to stop. I guess this was a hit for them. I have not played it so I have no idea what the game is all about at all. They wont let me play it if I try.
B0013LKFVO|2.0|While this bulb is very bright, the beam is misfocused.  So the flashlight is useless because all you get is a widely dispersed yet very dim amount of light.  I tried this bulb in several otherwise good flashlights with the same results.  It is possible that I received a bad bulb, but I haven't had time to contact Nite Ize for their comments.  I plan to do this.  The concept is great but it needs some refinement.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I can be anywhere in my house and check this even if the kids are watching TV. My husband travels alot and he will text me to see how the weather is here. In the wintertime, I take snap shot of them and send him pics of the radar to him. Perfect for him.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I was hooked from the first page. It was interesting to me from both the standpoint of the backpacking trip, as well as the spiritual journey. And she is a good writer-- combined plot and theme with lots of beautiful and pointed language.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is good to have a place other than the computer to check the messages. I just hate comfirming who I am every time I post something from home computer from Kindle...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A delight to play. ok ok ok ok ok ok<br /><br />Would ask why it starts you out at different places?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I will read more of Nicholas Sparks books. This was not the usual love story in a woman point of view. He covers all aspects in this book.  Cant wait to see the movie version.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was hooked from the first page! A lot of surprising twists and turns.  It totally held my interest throughout the whole book  There is always two sides to every story!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I was waiting 4 4ever I have it on my ipod and finally ITS HERE on my kindle thank god
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Although many romances are predictable, this book will keep you on your toes. It describes things well and makes you feel as if you're a character in the book. It's was a well planned and thought out book and most importantly it was realistic. This story is something that could happen to the best of anyone, and it does a good job of making you hold your breath.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|It's really boring so when I'm bord I chill out and drop some coins! Did I mention it's really boring!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Best book ever!!!!!!!!!! I love this so much that I have read it more than 3 times and still enjoyed it
B004J64QSI|5.0|The songs plus the singers are magnificent.<br />The story and the costumes all add to a perfect<br />Evening. If U have any doubts about my recomendation please reread the above.
B0015DRPJU|4.0|I began reading this series after a friend told me about it. At first I was like what ever another vamp book. I gave the 1st book a try and wow by this third book I was reading in record time! I kept going to the library (until I got a kindle)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|game to pass the time with. starts out with easy levels and gradually climbs to difficult. definitely a game everyone can play.
B002QGSYRC|2.0|David Halberstam had considerable writing skills. He researched his topics well. Perhaps he even deserved his Pulitzer prize.<br /><br />Let us suppose we write a biography of Halberstam.  We gather criticism and dirt from every enemy and rival.  We fill the pages with endless regurgitations of the negativism.  Here and there, for variety, we very briefly mentions his skills for a sentence or two.  We then go back are real and obsessive agenda of destroying his reputation.<br /><br />Imagine that Halberstam is on trial.  The prosecuting attorney presents reams of 'evidence'.  The defense attorney is bound and gagged.  That is exactly how Halberstam treats Douglas MacArthur.  He descends to the level of cheap demagogic journalism that might even embarrass the 60 Minutes crew.<br /><br />Who exactly won WW2 for us?  Eisenhower sitting on his butt at HQ or the slightly crazy commanders such as Halsey, Patton, and MacArthur.<br /><br />If Haberstam had presented a balanced account,  if he focused a bit more on the war, I might have given 4-5 stars.  But I am thoroughly disgusted with tawdry journalism.  Halberstam had great gifts.  It is a shame for him stoop to this level.  Lying with the truth is still lying.
B000002LEM|5.0|Just when you caught your breath from 5150 Sammy hits you with some excellent rock outs.... what a man.... yes
B000X8KGQM|5.0|We have considered using portions of this album for video production which emphasizes the human spirit in the face of personal difficulties, and it fulfills that function very well.  The album, without even knowing what transpires in the cinematography, is highly listenable and produces a presence of thought about spirit which is satisfying and understandable even to adolescents.  Full orchestra along with the voice treatments is well balanced with the interplay of light and life in a difficult land.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|Movie is funny from beginning to end and Mr. Bean, as I called him delivers. Highly recommends to friends who's into comedy. Waiting for his next movie. already.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I much prefer this to the original Judge Dredd! The costumes are more realistic, but the helmets are still comic book (ish) enough. Great movie!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Incredible.  Loved it.  It brought back memories of the movie- which was awesome.  highly recommend it to anyone who loves musicals.
076115678X|5.0|This book has all you need to embrace your curls and begin life anew. I only wish I'd had this book a long, long time ago.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Saw the movie at the theater and was happy to have the memories return by watching the blue-ray whenever I want.
B007C3TVNA|5.0|Eva Khatchadourian's life has completely changed since the incident involving her son Kevin at his school. She used to be a successful travel writer and now she took any job that would have her (in this case a clerk in a travel agency). She used to have a family in a large luxurious house, but now lives alone in a small squalid house. The people of her town are largely hostile towards her, splashing her house with red paint and even attacking her in the street. Kevin nears eighteen and she regularly visits him in jail despite not having much to talk about. Eva reflects upin her strained  relationship with Kevin and his complacent father who dismissed all of her concerns as she struggles to put some semblance of a life back together in the face of depression and the judgment of the people around her.<br /><br />I am really impressed with this film. It examines this fictional situation that has been seen countless times in the news over the years and simply presents pieces of the story as the film goes along, allowing the viewer to come up with their own rationalizations and judgments. There aren't any clear answers about anything because there are none in real life. It makes for a thought provoking and depressing film that has stayed with me. A major theme in the film is the lack of communication in the whole situation. Despite the title of the film, no one actually talks about Kevin. Every attempt Eva made to voice concern about him was dismissed by medical professionals and her husband. After her concerns went unheard, she stopped trying to voice them. This lack of communications permeates all aspects of Eva's life. She never really talks to the people who were devastated by Kevin's actions (which may have made her feel less alone and ostracized) or to her husband about her doubts about being a mother and wanting to travel more (which may have made their relationship and marriage better) or even to Kevin. It's actually quite sad how a healthy dose of communicationcould have helped a lot of the situations here.<br /><br />I loved Tilda Swinton's portrayal of Eva. She comes off as a sympathetic and human character. It seems as if she didn't really want to be a mother right from the beginning. She seemed detached from the other mothers in the pregnancy classes, abhors her constantly crying infant son, and even tells him that every day she wakes up she wishes she was in France. Unfortunately, society still considers it a taboo when a woman doesn't like being a mother or doesn't want children, so this portrayal is rarely seen. Many would see Eva as a terrible person, but motherhood really isn't for everyone. I'm sure there are many women out there that regret having children because our society puts forth that all women should want or like children and have a maternal instinct. Eva made some mistakes along the way, but she really loved Kevin and tried to do her best even when he was at his worst. Over time, she grew scared of him and knew that anything she said against him would be dismissed and would make her look irrational or cruel. In the aftermath of the incident, Eva takes a lot of grief and violence from the parents of Kevin's school mates. Instead of protesting this or even talking to them, she quietly takes the abuse and moves on. She believes Kevin's actions to be her fault and accepts the vitriol of others because she believes she deserves it. Eva is a flawed person, but is simply human and undeserving of such punishment.<br /><br />Kevin is a frightening character. Through the course of the film, he grew from a difficult infant to a sociopathic  teenager. Talented at manipulation, he uses the people to his advantage at every opportunity even at a young age. His relationships with Eva is complex and interesting. She is the only person who sees him for who he truly is, but he punishes her at every turn because he knows no one will believe her. His violent act is designed to hurt his mother in the deepest possible way, even going so far as to reference the children's book she read him when he was sick. The reason why Kevin ended up as he did is an obvious question and doesn't have a clear answer.<br /><br />The way the film is presented is disorienting at first. It starts after the incident but then constantly flashes back to life before from Kevin's birth to the incident in a fairly linear order. I would recommend watching the film at least twice because it makes much more sense the second time and more nuanced things can be recognized when not hindered by trying to figure out where every scene fits into the story timeline. The cinematography is striking. The color red is used in much of the film as a constant reminder of the blood and violence that Kevin caused.<br /><br />We Need to Talk About Kevin provides a different perspective on a story we have seen time and time again in the news. It provides some insight into how the people might feel in this situation and how something like this might happen without resorting to stereotypical smokescreens as other films have. I would recommend this highly disturbing and powerful film.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|this game keeps your attention all the way through...luved it !!! it kept me entertained all morning at work...lol !!
B009GIPDQS|2.0|I have always found John Grisham's books to be entertaining, enlightening and compulsive and I have espececially found his Theodore Boone series to be great for introducing young people to interesting reading, but unfortunately the Racketeer does not reach his usual standard, reasonable plot line but dead slow, I usually feel disappointed when I have to put one his books on the shelf to get on with the day or to go to sleep, but this one you could leave for a week and not feel any pain at all.
B0050R0YB8|4.0|As expected, this model is quite impressive and striking.  It's fun to build, as you keep thinking you've gotten to the back, only to find you have to add more and more.<br />The build does get a little repetitive due to the nature of all the detailing, but repeated sections are scattered enough that it isn't very noticeable in the final build.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|It is highlight, not a full recording, which I found out after I got the CD.<br /><br />But that's not the reason I gave it a one-star review. The sound was crispy, full of hizzes. FYI I'm listening from a proper pair of Grado rs1i connected to a dedicated sound card so it excludes the factor of me using crappy listening device. The sound quality can't be worse and it is a sheer piece of garbage in terms of recording.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Finally something my kids respond too. Love the idea of solving a math problem to make the snooze stop! Can you purchase on other apps as well?
B0060MYKTY|4.0|The Borgias' second season builds on the strengths of its first: plotting, acting and characterisation on the artistic side, costumes, sets and spectacle on the technical; this is a season in which everyone involved seems to have hit their stride, and whilst a production of this scope and ambition could always be better, consider me satisfied.<br /><br />Here in Australia it's been out since late 2012, so I've watched every episode and some of the Special Features. With this sort of historical drama I'd happily watch a ten hour documentary of the times. It certainly wouldn't hurt the producers credentials if, in these behind-the-scenes docos, they highlighted more those events in history faithfully dramatised by the show (naturally glossing over the inaccuracies).<br /><br />Overall this show has turned out better than I thought it would and is at least one star better than its closest rival, The Tudors, thanks in large part to a more charismatic lead in Jeremy Irons and a wonderful supporting cast. It may help that I'm less familiar with Rodrigo and Cesare Borgia than I am with Henry VIII, but even so, The Borgias has a natural energy and emotion The Tudors often struggled to achieve. It looks like a show made by people who wanted to tell its story rather than cynically cash in on its forerunner's success.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I love this album! It has a combination of great ballads, as well as fun songs. I always love her stuff, but this one is exceptionally good. I'd definitely recommend you download this album.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Works great and fairly easy to understand with just a basic knowledge of calculator skills.  Would recommend to family and friends.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Ordered this one Monday and received it Tuesday, a day early. The first thing I noticed is that it was larger than expected, which I like.  The canteen feels sturdy enough to take a fall or two, the cooking cup is littler larger than I thought it would be as well, has a couple of nice holders which bend out.  It also comes with a neoprene carrying case which has a strap for belts or hooks.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another Tom Clancy thriller that keeps you on the edge and is hard to put down.  I look forward to the next one in this series.
B004GYY714|5.0|I was looking for a stream to listen to the Pats playoff game.I realized I needed an app.Google App Store came up with TuneIn,great reviews so I got the free version just to hear the game......YA Right.I realized very fast that this app lets me listen to radio stations from all over the World!!It lists in real time what songs are being played on 100's of stations.If you search a band it shows what stations are playing that band.I found a 128kbs station in Hondorus that plays only Pink Floyd(some VERY deep rare songs)!! I am going to get the pro,right now,for 99c(On Amazon).With it you can record content to your memory card!! I thought Pandora was good,TuneIn blows it away.I was missing a real person talking on the other end of my \\"radio\\".Missing it no more.Technology is great....sometimes!! This time!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I used to be a John Grisham fan, then I thought his books became lame and uninteresting.  Now along comes The Racketeer and he has rekindled my status in him.  What a book.  As a twist the bad guy wins, or is he a bad guy?  You'll have to form your own opinion on this one.  I really liked the twist and turns and the unexpected ending.  This book will keep you interested until the very end!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|My BFF was super excited to get this.  Wish they had it on blu-ray, but he was happy none the less.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I read a Harry Bosch book once and got caught up with him as a character.  I have two more Harry Bosch books to read before I can say I have read the entire Bosch series.  I have also read a few of Michael Connelly's Lincoln Lawyer books as well, but I prefer the Harry Bosch books.  This one was in keeping with all the others he has written.  I wonder who will retire first - Harry Bosch of Michael Connelly?
B007IXWKUK|4.0|ADORED the sequel to Grey...it kept my attention in its entirety. It was absolutely heart breaking and warming! It invokes every emotion possible...from passion to bitterness! MUST read Freed NOW!!! Haha.

B009WJ14FA|5.0|Hipsters may be retro, but in some cases they do things as well as the original. Rockin! Funkin! Danceable! Energetic! As the lead singer says, he is channeling the best of Tina Turner.  Man emulates woman role model! Damn straight.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Highly interesting book written by medical expert, but obviously the result of a tremendous amount of imagination built upon neurological memories/dreams, etc.  Hopefully real- but??
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It does everything it says it can do. The weather was a nice touch. You can adjust the volume and snooze length. I recommend it!
B004XISI4A|5.0|George RR Martin continues the dance , weaving the main characters expertly. Some are taken by death maybe to return.  New characters appear to challenge for the throne. Those left of the Stark children appear to be on personal missions of survival. Winter is almost here and the North is in total chaos. Religious fanatics are taking control of Kingslanding . Betrayals are rampant. Dragons are loose and there are more magical forces in play. This series of books doesn't seem to have an end in sight. Hopefully I will live to see the end game. Maybe if we put Martin in an ice cell at the Wall.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So much better then I could have hoped for. I couldn't put it down. So much more than a love story.
B007VYQ9G2|4.0|This movie is pretty good. I have all of the Disneynature films and this one isnt the best or worst, about average

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I wanted to read the book before the movie and I am so happy I did!! This book was a true Sparks book! I couldn't put it down and a great little twist at the end, which I never saw coming!!! Amazing!!!
078885996X|5.0|This movie just seems to get better the more times it's viewed.  There are so many subtle things that you don't necessarily get from one viewing; for instance, giving Jacob Marley a brother named Bob.  I never caught that until this Christmas.  Having both a widescreen and fullscreen version is great, because the song &#34;When Love Is Gone&#34; (from the fullscreen version) is an important dramatic scene and really lends more sympathy for old Scrooge's current state.  This version follows the original story better than a lot of Christmas Carol re-tellings.  The only qualm might be that children under the age of ten probably won't understand this movie unless they're already familiar with the story.  There's probably not enough silliness and physical jokes to appeal to very young viewers.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Gets boring after a while not all the stuff from the pc is in it. How can you even blow up tnt?

B008M0NDOK|4.0|The Duo Gamer Ipad makes playing games on the Ipad a lot of fun! You are limited in that the Duo Gamer will only work on certain games. I downloaded a racing game that only cost $1.99 and my family has fun playing it.<br />The Duo Gamer comes with a stand that you put your Ipad on so that your can play the game more easily. I was not sure the stand came with the Gamer until I opened the box - the box does was not very clear on this issue.<br />The controller links with Bluetooth and I was able to set it up quickly.<br />I am hopeful that more games will be come available to use with the controller! I also use the included stand for my Ipad when I watch movies.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I really like the fact that it is really easy to use and the file transfer feature almost makes it a must have for all PC's
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Marvel maniacs should be thrilled to see Jack Kirby's inspired designs on the big screen. Blu Ray is very nice and bonus features always a big plus!
B005WYFLNU|3.0|At first my daughter was absolutely thrilled about this book. However, when she got to the fancy ball gowns, we were really dissappointed that the stickers got printed upside down, therefor when the stickers were cut, the whole page was ruined because the stickers were confusing once they were pulled off the page. Im not really sure how an error like this happens when every other page was printed and cut correctly. I wish I had known this prior to it being a present she openned on Chirstmas day.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Marvel maniacs and Kirby fans should be happy with this movie. Blu Ray is great. Bonus materials are always welcomed.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Excellent story,well written,moves quickly and keeps your interest thru the entire book.I would recommend the book highly.Characters are interesting w/lots of action.
B000EOTTV8|3.0|I got this for someone who is genderqueer. I was hoping it would have been more content about transgenderism but overall it was a good movie. I would recommend to add it to your glbtq library of movies.
B009TSA6YE|5.0|My daughter pre ordered it on Dec.6, and now it's out of stock. I guess Amazon can do what they want.But it seems like they had enough time to get enough copies. I wish I could find another way to buy music.  I was looking forward to this. After I watch the dvd I'm Sure it is 5 stars. I<br /><br />I'm better now that I got it this morning.  I watched the first part(not at the volume I prefer} and enjoyed it. I can't wait to see the whole video as Michael has always been one of my favorite guitarists.there is solo,some scorpions and some UFO 3 of my favorite acts on one video.  I'm looking forward to turning it up on tuesday.
B004Q3QRWC|3.0|It was good to read something modern, with some well-presented interesting characters whose lives interchange over many years. I read this a couple of months ago and I don't remember a lot, other than that the highlight for me was many thought provoking conversations between characters.<br /><br />It seemed a little slow sometimes however I could visualise it working well in movie format. This was read as part of a bookclub but was replaced by another book due to some negative feedback. It's not for everyone but I can see why many would find it interesting and I'm glad I read it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is one of the best movie I watched on 3D. The effects in 3D are really stunning and you feel that you in the Pandora with Jack..It will always be a part of my collection.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|What can I say except the same thing so many others have stated that Google is a top notch search engine.
B006H5120E|5.0|Beautiful to watch in 3D. I suggest everybody should keep it in their collection. Nice pack at awesome price. My whole family loved it
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a lot of fun no matter the age.  The only problem is getting so involved the time just flies by without realizing it.  Make sure you have a lot of free time to enjoy this game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed it up until the final few chapters when it got mean and controlling.  I felt it should have taken a little while longer and made it not so evil.
B004V5QWU2|1.0|Noticeable loops and the loops are only a minute long (if that) not worth the money. Find a free one instead.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have enjoyed th we games I have unlocked so far .I'm sure I will get hours of fun out of this game
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. It's truly amazing. I recommend everyone read this book. Very inspirational quotes.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Good mindless entertainment. I wish the difficulty increased and you had bonuses you could achieve, but still a fun game. Definitely worth downloading.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|it is a really good game but I do not know how to get a blade. It is my favorite blade because I have it on my phone. but it says that you have to get the same score of something and I do not know what it really is. in fact I have never heard of it in my life until I got the app. but I an not joking &quot;IT IS REALLY FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNN!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved it!  :)<br /><br />Addictive and fun. I play this game daily. Challenging objectives, decent graphics, and easy controls.
B0098JJYZQ|4.0|A great follow up to Gabriel's inferno! Filled with lots of poetic and Dante references integrated drama entwined. A great read.
0316019984|5.0|DC Super Heroes, The Ultimate Pop-Up Book<br /><br />So, my wife bought this little gem for me for Christmas.  Unfortunately, I've been pretty busy with work, so I didn't have much of a chance to go through it and pick it apart.  Fortunately for you guys, I'm able to write out my thoughts and review it.  So without waiting any longer, here it is.<br /><br />At first glance, this \\"little gem\\" really isn't little, not considering how big a book typically is.  For size comparison, the book is about the size of a collector's edition of World of Warcraft.  If you don't have one of those, imagine a 3 inch, 3-ring binder.<br /><br />Upon opening the book, the first DC super hero to emerge is none other than the Man of Steel flying at the reader.  The art is very detailed, although you might have some problems with the pop-ups, a simple twitch of the paper can usually fix it.  While fully expanded, the book's width is roughly twice, yes, I said \\"twice\\", the size of the book when sitting on a bookshelf.  On the page, you will find a simple biography, or summary of the character.  But that's not all.  On the sides of the pop up, you will find additional booklets that open and tell additional stories of the character, to include: the origins of the character, enemies, and other supporting characters such as Lois Lane or Supergirl.  Oh, did I mention that they too have pop-ups?  Yeah, the little booklets have them also.  For this book, a lot of the information that you learn is based around the Justice Society of America.<br /><br />The next page is personally my favorite, more or less because I was and still am a big fan of the character.  The Dark Knight explodes from the page in a similar fashion to Superman, but with the iconic spotlight glowing in the background.  It shuts off rather quickly, which is disappointing, but while it's on, truly brings the page to life.  Again, like Superman, the page has history pop-ups and information about key villains and his sidekick, DickGrayson.<br /><br />If I went over the rest of this book, you'd be listening to a 20 minute review, so I'll cut it at that.  There is over 45 characters throughout this book.  Most are on the last page, which is a massive collage of them.  Maybe room for additional books, lets hope so.<br /><br />My pros and cons.<br /><br />What I loved about the book was the attention to detail, the blend of so many characters with their quick summaries and histories, and the telling of the JSA in a nutshell.  As someone who has followed some characters more than others, I found this book to be similar to the Book of Cain, meant as a quick read but it was more about the art than anything else.  I also loved the fact that the main members of the JSA is the focal point of the book and that with each main member, you have the supporting cast of characters.<br /><br />There is a couple of cons for the book, mainly with what I mentioned, pop-ups not fully expanding.  The book is pretty stiff from storage, so I'd recommend fully expanding the pages.  You'll feel that you are breaking the pages which might sound weird.  These pages are relatively thick and resemble card board more than typical paper.  The other con would be the light, it could be just mine.<br /><br />The DC Super Heroes, the Ultimate Pop-Up Book is 6 sections with each being a 2 page spread.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone loving DC Comics, or comics in general.  You can find this on Amazon for under 20 dollars.  As someone who love to showcase my collectibles, this is my latest addition.  It sure brings the kid out of you.<br /><br />5 Stars out of 5<br /><br />Barry
B004M8CMVQ|3.0|I love Terry Pratchett, and love Sean Astin, but it's just too hard to do justice to the Luggage for this to be a great show.  Would watch again, but rarely.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I enjoyed this book because the story flowed well .It was slightly predictable but was a jolly good read. I would read another from the same series.<br />A good book to take on holiday.
B009157BWU|5.0|We love the DisneyNature series!  Chimpanzee is an engaging, heart-felt story.  And the narration is actually good, though it could be better or atleast more detailed.  We were so annoyed by the narration for Oceans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ive tried block story lite and survival craft but this is truly supierior. Great work Mojang!!!! This appnis almost as satisfying as the PC version. Just a few bugs, but I see why this is the most popular paid app. 5 stars, and well worth the 6.99!!!!!!!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|A really good fast pace action movie.  This is a really great follow up to the Bourne Trilogy.  If you are a bourne fan then I don't think you will be disappointed
B004Q9TYWQ|2.0|i enjoyed several of the texts in the books, while others felt made up. after a while the apparent perverse and unintended turn resulting from the texts is just lame. don't spend money on this.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|It is not that I didn't like the quality of the Movie but how can this be for young adults.  This movie is about children going out and killing children.  And in the wake of all the school shootings that has happen over the last couple of years I'm not so sure why this is so popular.  I wouldn't let my children see this movie.  I was quite sad to see!
0553505416|1.0|I'm looking forward to giving a better rating to this particular book, but as yet have not received the book!!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Always hard to end a book series which is so good.  Not my favorite ending, but good read all the same.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I took this book to the beach and it was perfect! It was enjoyable and an easy read! made my getaway that much more enjoyable.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|You can't go wrong with Radiohead and I love the Amazon availability and price. I would recommend this to any &#34;Header&#34;. Great. new and interesting sounds and songs...
B0043JDUNS|4.0|This is a plain, fun good time movie. I watched it while on a VERY long flight. It was the perfect distraction.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|Two Octaves in better than one!!! What a difference an extra octave makes. The mini piano has enough keys to play many many songs. The different instruments give variety. And the “follow the notes” feature is great for someone just starting out. It is worth every penny of the $1.99 charge.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I think I would have enjoyed this game but after trying to download it six times I gave up.  money thrown away.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really enjoy this game and play it every day. The challenge is at just the right level to me. Graphics could be better, but that's not too big of a deal. Overall lots of fun!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Had never seen this movie before but many adults told me it was worth checking out.  I'm glad I did.  I rented it while I had the flu and it definitely made me smile.  &#34;Buddy the elf, what's your favorite color?&#34;
B009UX2YAC|1.0|it took all of my freaking money and through it all away right before I can get Tony I freaking hats it.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|I think the controls are a bit twitchy, but it's nice to have a two-player game on my Kindle.  It's brightly colored (nice to look at) and entertaining.
B008DVJO8C|4.0|She has alot of hatred in her songs. Was not as pleased as some of my other selections. I am done with this one
B00316DDUE|5.0|I like concerts on DVD and wanted to add Blu-Rays to my collection.  This concert has a nice variety of music and is interesting to watch.  Sometimes I find Yanni's 'movement' a little distracting, but overall I really enjoy this concert.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I was very surprised that there was a few other songs that I had heard that I did not know was on there
B0026145WK|5.0|It was action packed, full of wonderful emotions-unconditional love, courage, selflessness and it makes a strong point.  There is human trafficking and it needs stopped.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Great product quality, arrived on time in great condition, the price was right, a sound purchase, plays well evenon my player
1579129129|5.0|Beyond expectations  -  wonderful information.  Simon Winchester brings skulls back to life with facts and stories and the most interesting data.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Edge of your seat the whole time. Fantastic!!! I can hardly wait for the next book. I will be reading it for sure.
B00AMS4H2M|1.0|Why Is It That Amazon Is Always Missing Songs On Certain Cds? Thats Crazy How You Getting Ripped Off Like That. I Go To Itunes All The Time To Make Sure How Many Songs Are Suppose TO Be On A Cd
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|The quality was great, I just thought the movie was stupid! It had a couple funny parts, but it didn't make up for the bad parts
B00338QENI|5.0|A fascinating story of cancer and medical research told not only from the scientific perspective but also from the view of the patient and her family. This is about the ethics, or lack thereof, of using people for scientific research without full disclosure and informed consent. The most surprising aspect of the book is that this occurred in the not too distant past. A must read for anyone interested in the interaction of science and humanity.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The price was right. Awesome bag that fits everything and was well thought out. It was worth the price I paid
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks comes through again with another heart warming romance that tugs at your heart strings! He adds this unnexpected twist in the end that really pulled it together for me! Definitely recemend this book!
B004JN1D2I|2.0|The books are undoubtedly some of the best out there. My critique is not of the author or the books themselves. My critique is of the delivery mechanism of the &#34;Bundle&#34;. You can not access the books individually on your device regardless of whether it is a Kindle or other device. They are delivered as one giant volume. If you want to track your progress within the book your reading good luck. If you accidently lose you place good luck getting back. Each 1% on the meter constitutes 40 or 50 pages. I will not buy a bundle again. The little bit I saved is not worth the poor user experience of them being lumped into one giant volume. Just my two cents.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome. Groovy. Freakin' spiffy! I like the music. I like the game. All around lots of fun! Guess that's just about all I have to say!
B007TMON8M|1.0|Every time I launch this application it opens and then proceeds to immediately close.  I am using a T mobile G2x
B00AESN8XY|5.0|As a biology major and healthcare worker, I love how accurate this game is. I get to mutate my own bacteria, virus, fungus, etc. I also like the witty news bulletin that show up. Scary and fun!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me riveted to it. So many twists & turns. I would highly recomment it. I couldn't put it down.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this was a fun game and very hard to put down!  the graphics and sound effects were great!  it was a fun storyline too!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|A great game of strategy and chance. We can play it with both adults and children. I would strongly recommend it.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|It is a fun and entertaining game. I sure is a challenge to beat the clock. Sometimes it is impossible but I try again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I realy enjoyed this book. Is is a very different manner to treat people with cancer. It was not only suffering but rather a compilation of hope to live knowing you are doomed
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is fun to play & I play it a lot. It was easy to down load on my kindle.
B004G600A4|5.0|I love this movie because it is like a throw back to the old Disney movie style. The more recent Disney movies didn't have a musical element to them. It's great to have that again.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game immediately  became a new family hit for 3 generations at Christmas when we were together. Only thing we would have done differently was get the expansion pack too.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The story itself is phenominal!!  Hearing the play by play of the tests the Seals have to take and how they do it without passing judgement of those who at least try but that is not the place for them. They explained some things early that could have waited until they applied and a little too long-winded.  Example being the rules of the village that took him in. Reading this book opened my eyes!  It is so heartbreaking that our side is the only one that follows the rules and our soldiers have to die because our society likes to pass judgment as they sit in the FREE U.S. A. all safe and warm.  SO TRAGIC.  The sacrifices are endless!  The stress, the strength (mentally and physically), the patience, the intellect is beyond what I could have imagined and I loved really knowing what goes on in their heads and behind the scenes.  It breaks my heart that lives were lost because they had to worry about the media crucifying them for such difficult choices. The media should get up and show some personal sacrifice to protect their own family and country!  Won't happen though beause they are protected by the men/women they continue to judge and criticize!  For these military warriors and their families COURAGE is NOT a strong enough word and neither are the words THANK YOU!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Even with the repetition and the non stop sex the action makes it worth the time to read, better than the first book.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Book was ok but I don't know if i would read Book 2.  Kind of feel like this book wasn't worth the money or my time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is much better than the other two, but still needs improvement on the sexual details, I did enjoy the action, wish there was more of that and less sex
1781163243|5.0|This was a great book with interesting pictures.  Cool book to have if you are anywhere near a Halo Fan!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Get past the first few chapters and it starts to get interesting, but the sex details are not the best, I think the editor needed more experience in the bedroom to correct the writers ideas.
B000N2HBSO|3.0|It's just too much detail and too long for me to keep up with all the players. I think I've got Bates, Chase, and Seward down. The B listers are harder (Blairs, Stanton, etc.)
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a fun app, you create and control a destructive \\"Plague\\" that all the power is at your finger tips and you decide whats next!!! THIS APP IS A MUST GET!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hoover does an amazing job of writing on some seriously difficult subjects.  The story pulls you in and holds until the final page.  The reader will go through so many emotions that draw you into the story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books. I blush and giggle like a little girl every time I read them. Wow wow wow
B001VB8UAE|5.0|THE BEST!!  THE DVD'S ARE PERFECT AS DESCRIBED, SO FUN TO WATCH, GREAT SHOWS BY BARBARA, LOTS OF STARS AT THE SHOWS!!
B007N5YIUS|1.0|This would not work on my Kindle Fire. It says it is designated for the tablet.  Can't rate it and am really disappointed so much of the apps now are just for the tablet.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|We started with this app and my daughter (5 yr old) fell in love with it, playing it over and over.  She liked it so much, I decided to buy all of the Dr. Panda games.  She has no issues navigating or using the app - it is well designed and easy for a child to use.<br /><br />Not necessarily the best choice on my part as not all of the Dr. Panda games operate as well as this one.  Veggie Garden and Day Care are the ones we have issues with.  I will live more specific reviews on those apps
B007I2BYX0|5.0|If you're into grungy rock music, this girl has the perfect voice! Untamed and uncensored, this is a completely wonderfull CD
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|Dr. Panda games have now been a standard for my daughter.  When a new one comes out, it is a no-brainer for us to buy it for her.  She finds a new one and excitedly brings her tablet to me and asks for it - no problem, I know it's a good game and she will enjoy it.  Dev is cool too and has responded directly to us if we had an issue.  You won't regret getting this game for your kids.
0988262592|5.0|I immediately related to the scenario outlined in Project Phoenix.  As a former VP of IT operations, I instantly recalled the firefighting and chaos that frequently ensued in my department.  I literally found myself laughing out loud at the celebration of developers hitting deadlines by dropping crappy code and leaving IT ops to figure it out.  I have recommended this book to every IT operations and IT development manager I know.  I wish I had this level of insight and inspiration back when I worked IT for a manufacturing company.  IT is clearly changing, and Project Phoenix is like a GPS system for the IT professional that wants to not only survive, but win in this race to employability.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a great story..I loved it sooooo much...Animal stories always seem to pull at the heart strings, this one definately accomplishes that...
B00A80SHFM|4.0|For the most part the choices of included songs is good, but certain songs such as &#34;Do You Hear the People Sing,&#34; &#34;A Little Fall of Rain,&#34; and &#34;Lovely Ladies&#34; should have been included. Hopefully they'll release a full motion picture soundtrack, but for the cost and for &#34;highlights&#34; this is a good cd.
B001EN71DG|5.0|I think getting the box set is worth it.  We now have all 6 movies that we can watch when ever we wish.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It worked great for a while but recently started freezing when I click on a picture or something in the news feed. When I try to press the back button it doesn't work unless I doubt press it, and sometimes that makes it sound out.very annoying. But otherwise I like the app
B001EN71DQ|5.0|This set is what I was looking for.  I wanted the original movies and that is what I got in this box set.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great book by John Grisham. Love the twist and turns of this story.  I loved all the well thought out details.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've used Evernote and Astrid for quite awhile for work and home and they are almost like business partners to me. Evernote's flexibility makes organization easy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the easy levels are good for little kids and the harder levels are good for bigger kids or adults. its great !!!!!
B002NN5F7A|3.0|The movie was good, but I kept having issues with the streaming and the movie freezing. I don't know if its amazon or my internet
031603441X|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he read it all already. He said it was great and so much insight to the Rolling Stones!
B001UHOWXI|5.0|I really enjoy having both the color version and the black and white version. A good movie to watch at Christmas time.
1401311091|5.0|I love this book! It was a good, quick read! Doesn't take the place of the show...but it's a nice addition! I have it in kindle format too! I got this paperback because it was a good price!
1935597760|5.0|As I read this work of fiction it came to me over and over again \\"this is too powerful not to be true\\" then at the end of the book Christina McKenna disclosed the truth behind the story.<br /><br />The last of these orphanages closed in 1996. 1996? 1996! Staggering it is the importance of such a well told tale by this author. I hope everyone of those children finds her book and feels the honor and respect this story imparts.<br /><br />Family secrets and institutional secrets abound in the ripping up and apart of children's souls throughout history. The Catholic Church too many times was and is the Temple of Tears.<br /><br />McKenna is the female Frank McCourt, in my humble opinion. The story grabbed me. McKenna has the Irish storytelling ability to take you to the edge of a most horrible abyss in the horror done to and experienced by children then give you humorous relief to stop you from going over that edge...to keep on reading to a deeply emotional comforting end of the story.<br /><br />Character and place descriptions so vivid through the Looking Glass we go to inhabit another world.<br /><br />Native Americans tell us storytelling is medicine, a good story is good medicine, this book is good medicine.<br /><br />Bravo to the author.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|Great acting by everyone.Love the story. Great action and love for everyone. Even funny at times too. Would recomend to anyone.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book reached my injured spirit and has given me a real feeling of peace.  This world can be a tough place to live and this book gave me the peace in my life that I was praying for.  There are not words to describe the change in my life.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|It seems silly. Almost every other twitter client is better than Twitter's own client. I'm a Mac user and prefer Tweetbot because of the interface, the swipe gestures, even the sound of new tweets is great. Twitter falls short almost everywhere. It's not intuitive, the interface / text is boring and new DM's or PM's don't seem to look &#34;important&#34; enough.<br /><br />Twitter could do some great things with their app. For example, I get an email from them every week that tells me What's interesting with the people I follow. And I read every word. Click every link. Because it is interesting. They could add this information in their app to make this more of a real-time suggestion so it's available when I need it. That might make it interesting enough for me to actually keep Tweetbot AND Twitter on my devices.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|.It was not what I expected.  I loved the Phantom of The Opera and the Music.<br />I did not like this Love Never Dies at all.  The music was awful.  Wish I never purchased it.<br /><br />Barbara Curtis
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Plex makes watching your movies from anywhere on any device a snap. Much better than Apple TV and any other service that is out there. While the apps are paid, the server software is free. One of the best ways to manage and play your movies and music.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Trust me, just read it. Nothing I can say will do it justice. And if you think you'll be thrown off by the slightly religious content of the book, I believe you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I love the Dark Knight Batman trilogy, and this one is great!!! A must have in any movie collection. This one had the best surprises of the three, but all three are excellent.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Haha good book and all but kind of sad when he didn't put the the end thing at the end page
0671449028|5.0|I like this book. The illustrations are beautiful, flows well and I don't get sick of reading it every day.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Fun for all ages could be a little faster paced and cheaper to catch rare animals but still fun for free least try it for yourself
067144901X|5.0|I like this book.  Cute and doesn't get sickening reading it every day.  Nice illustrations! Good way to learn about animals and their sounds. Flows well.
B00633W614|5.0|I actually bought this by mistake but what a lucky one.  The author get you hooked on the story and keeps you interested until the end.  This is the first of 3 books.  I've not had time to read the next but I have great expectations for it.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Just finished. Tremendously written, I very insightful. It has helped me start changing my habits right away. I'm reading again already.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|Ian Hunter's still got it!! ... And the Rant Band is great with him. Love this album, every track :)
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This is a wonderful musical, family film! I loved being able to watch it with my 14 year old daughter.  She now enjoys it as much as the rest of the family.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was instantly intrigued by this book because of the voice of the narrator, Death. He told Leisel's amazing story in a way that no ambiguous third person narrator ever could. I also loved how human everyone was. Even Death, though obviously immortal and invisible, was human-like with his \\"circular heartbeat.\\" Markus Zusak was able to let me sympathize and understand the Germans and the Nazis and  Death without ever letting me forgot who truly deserved my pity and who was truly the bad guy. This is a beautiful story and one of the best books I've ever read.
B0010SKTRA|5.0|For those who find human anatomy perplexing rather than obvious or boring, Your Inner Fish helps explain a lot.  Where evolution gets to can be interesting, but it is even worse than bureaucratic planning, military strategizing, and religious ceremonies at having any idea what it is doing or why.  Take a look at yourself and say, &#34;Welcome, strange accident, to a haphazard world.&#34;  Well, now that we're here we might as well enjoy it as best we know how.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read this book because so many friends had told me they loved it.<br /><br />It's well written-except it's almost impossible to relate to the main characters... You don't love them, sympathize with them or ever really understand them.  So it's hard to get really invested in the story when you really don't care that much about the characters. The twists and turns are fun, so that's why the three stars. But in the end, I wouldn't recommend this book.
B004Y042N8|3.0|Just a simple puzzle game. Doesn't have ads so that is nice but its rather plain and boring. Gets old fast.
B007XHWROK|4.0|The cd was is great shape and my daughter loves it. It kinda gets annoying to listen too but that's to be expected
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Miyazaki's Nausicaa is another well loved movie in out collection.  This tale stresses the importance of unity with the environment, but also includes many other lessons and motifs.  This is another one that my kids love as much as I do.
0316228532|3.0|If you like stories about petty, small-minded individuals and their hormonally and psychologically developing, mid-teenage children in a small English town, you may like this book. The youngsters are better delineated than their parents, but are still rather two-dimensional. I had no sympathy with any of the characters. There's not much plot--the novel is mostly concerned with how this handful of families reacts to the opening of a seat on the parish council (the \\"casual vacancy\\") due to the sudden death of one member.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is another must have for your collection, even if you are not knowledgeable enough about Japanese culture and history to catch the nod toward the Ainu plight that is made.  This story is of mythic proportions, and a cursed prince must find the cure and heal the land (and its spirit).
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|dont have this get it now lol funny to small of word to say bout this movie .  guy does voices on family guy is on it
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I am no expert when it comes to Nerf guns, but my boy does a lot of research, and this one pleased him very much.  He particularly likes the rapid-fire and being able to have multiple cartridges.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW!!!! Absolutely amazing.  I loved the characters and the storyline was awesome.  I love how she takes 2 characters and ties them together to make a truely unforgettable book.  I totally live this book.  I laughed and I cried and I didn't put it down.  The book grabbed me and didn't let me go.  I can't wait to read more from this author.  It definately needs to be made into a movie.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is so funny. I can watch evey week and every time I watch it I  laugh. It is really great to see this movie with your bong or something like Ted. Don't hesitate on buying it. This movie is a must have. Especially if you like family guy!
B0029XFNAI|5.0|I loved this movie, I think it is cute and classic. Mara Wilson is great it it. My children (6 and 2) are not interested in this movie at all. I think it's more for older children.
B005LAII08|5.0|The theme of the movie is very interesting and the effects are amazing. I really enjoyed how they made the Scottish accents and the bears. It is a nice movie for everyone. I really recommend it
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This novel really makes you feel like you are the main character and go through life with him. Must read AMAZING
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Even though this is a book that I'm pretty sure is not supposed to be marketed to my age group ( I'm 28) I love \\"The Heroes Of Olympus\\" book series. I could barely wait for this book too come out! It was so worth it! Completely amazing! Non stop action! I can't believe I have to wait a full year for book 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Omg!!!!!!! I loved all five of the \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" books and when  I saw book one on this series \\"  the lost hero\\" I went crazy.  I love the humor and the way he ties modern day things in with ancient Greek and Roman. This is an amazing series for people of all ages!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is yet another chapter in the lives of my favorite birds. So many more choices. I really love playing it.
B0042OZDQG|4.0|Overall it is a good album. I had some of his earlier songs, and was hoping to see them, but no luck. But, overall it is a good grouping of his music.
0547564651|3.0|In the book How Children Succeed, author Paul Tough shares what he believes is needed to make successful children. Drawing from numerous studies and field interviews, the author conveys that character has more to do with success than IQ.<br /><br /> As a mother of six children, I bought this book hoping for some insight that might radically change my parenting style, or complement my parenting style to ensure success of my kids. That was not the case. This book, although extremely well written and easy to read, did nothing more than cite case studies that showed early intervention of children could propel them to higher levels of learning. Now, that's not something new. The author states that perseverance, optimism, curiosity and self-discipline are character traits that help a child succeed more so than IQ. Although probably true, why would that be thought-provoking? Most parents would agree that a lazy child with a high IQ is probably not going to succeed as much as a strong-willed child who has self-discipline and has overcome difficulties.<br /><br /> Here's what this book offered: a theory tested in the field, numerous case studies by credible psychologists and neuroscientists, and a lot of feel-good stories to support the theory. Here's what I liked about the book: in my opinion it's all true. Yet, I did not get out of the book what I had hoped to find: a clear-cut way to ensure my children succeed. After reading this book, I have not learned anything new that I didn't already know as a parent. I felt this book was written to motivate educators in the field and not as a helpful tool for parents
B000P0J024|5.0|Great musicians making outstanding music. You will never hear these all together again, we've lost of great folks. Buy it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very good app. Very easy to navigate and go to other areas not just the last one you were on.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Not a typical fan of the violin, especially as a solo instrument, but WOW this girl can play.  I put off sampling the music, for the very reasons of before. I happened to see a video of her playing and I was hooked from then on.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Very good app. Could be easier to navigate to enjoy all aspects of Facebook, It does provide the basics for a quick scan
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A very good follow up from no. 1. The families continue into second world war with passion, great story telling and historical relevance
B004YXE438|5.0|These puzzles are lots of fun. You can go easy if you don't want to stress of you can go difficult if you want a challenge. A great assortment of very colorful puzzles. And you can't lose the pieces!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I pre-ordered it.  Great price;  3 blurays for less than $10 each....not bad!!!!  Nice box set too . . .
B008XCM18Q|5.0|I had seen the movie before reading the book. Quite a bit different from the movie. The book kept me on my toes, wondering what would happen next.
0385360169|3.0|At first thought I would not continue on in this series because it started with so much sex that there wasn't really a lot but now I am caring for the characters and think I will try book 2 of this series.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a very good book but I was hoping for a more exiting ending. Over all I recommend it to all!
1619695006|1.0|Am a huge Harry Potter/J.K. Rowling fan so even though the condition of the CDs were in great shape the content of the book was hugely disappointing.  Lots of foul language.  Unhappy ending and much sadness.
1451613512|5.0|At last, \\"Empire America\\" is finally exposed. Never have I ever seen a more detailed, documented history of this country's modern history. As a retired USAF officer/fighter pilot having served for 21 years, and a veteran of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Panama, and Vietnam who experienced first-hand, all-to-well, the lies and subterfuge that put so many honorable men in harm's way, I experienced the gamut of emotions from anger to sadness as I watched the dirty \\"truth\\" peeled away to expose what has sadly become the foundation of Pax Americana. In an educational system that goes out of its way to contort or simply bury US history, this book and documentary needs to become required reading and viewing for at least this country's upper level high school students, and those who move on to college....The clock is ticking as the rest of the world sees this country for what it has become. We must return to the principles that our forefathers envisioned, and once again become the honorable beacon of true fredom and democracy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series. It absolutely captivated me. I can't wait for the next one. Equally as good as fifty shades and might be better!
B00969PR18|5.0|I found this ap to work quite well.  The routing feature was excellent!  Ilive in a very rural area and found that the local maps are impressively quite up to date.  It was easy to map my routes while still connected to wi-fi and then save the routesfor easy access whenever I needed it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app! Thanks be to God for the person/persons whom God gave this job to! I love this app and there isn't enough words to describe my gratitude for this app.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|In every girl there is a warrior, do not quench their spirit. I love this movie and every girl with low self esteem should watch this.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not just about bashing heads and blood gushing (although, that's all cool.) Great characters, Andrew Lincoln rocks. Love the graphic novels and this show, though it will deviate, still does the books justice. Enjoy....and keep your ax nearby.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|It was interesting. Jack has flaws and is very good and inflicting damage. I like series but I have sevral other I will read before I consider getting back to this.
0743517822|5.0|I gave this to my husband for Christmas and we listened to the entire audio book on our road trip to see our family. It was so interesting. Disc 1 is more interesting than Disc 2, but overall I would recommend this and I would listen to it again just to pick up new information I missed the first time.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Whole Lotta Rollin' Makes stuck in traffic good, sand in my eyes, and the sky is turning Brown and I feeeeeeel like I can't go on
B000FC10WU|5.0|I am a great fan of Agatha Christie! I would recommend to anyone who likes a good mystery  with intrigue and even a little humor.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow...quite a departure from the last two books!!  I was not really expecting all the losses that Katniss endures this time around, but I'm glad it ended the way it did.  A real portrait of war, both the good and the bad points.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I love this series so far but this book is my least favorite. I would of rather had the interlacing of all the characters as Martin said he decided not to do...however that does leave  me very excited for the next one!
B0053O89IS|5.0|Bones is a great series and this season is better!  This is very funny and serious rolled up into one series.  Great!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a really good book! I would tell everyone to read it as long ad they are over 20 years old .
1402786360|5.0|I admit, I'm a fan of Sprinklebakes the blog. I bought the book, because the blog is fantastic. This book does not disappoint. There are plenty of new things, besides some that I have seen online.<br /><br />I'm very picky about cookbooks, I won't buy anything that doesn't have photos and I prefer books with photos for each recipe. Heather goes beyond that, each recipe has a full color photo and several of the more challenging ones have several step-by-step photos (especially helpful are the macaron instructions!).<br /><br />I'm an advanced baker and I've tried several of her recipes with great success. My sister who is a dabbler was able to successfully create macarons on her first try because of the clear and easy instructions.<br /><br />Would absolutely recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is completely amazing!!! The suspense is unbearable and the love story makes my heart sing! I love this book!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This novel really resonated with me, even though I have never had an operations role in my infosec career. However, as an infosec professional and consultant, 'The Phoenix Project' does a great job of helping to gain insight on how your actions (or lack thereof) can have a far wider impact than you might think it does. Fast paced, easy to read, and with enough low level details to satiate the tech crowd while still having broad appeal to non-tech folks.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved it! although i hate singing movies this one was really good! love fat amy! . . . .
B003F1WM2K|4.0|Thought this would be light reading but found myself reading and re-reading line after line to absorb the feelings Patti portrayed.  Maplethorpe is an interesting character as portrayed by her, as well as her interactions with such a huge variety of celebrities over the years.  A very thorough retrospective of a famous time in NYC.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Finally, it's available on my kindle fire.<br />Amazing game. Best app purchase I have made on this kindle  Now just for them to make a windows phone version.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|really cute game.  would be better if they didn't try to gouge you for the gems.  also I don't think that you should have to purchase gems for ponies required to finish the game when it is advertised as free.  also the social aspect is VERY glitchy.
B0086449YA|3.0|My husband is a big fan of Knopfler, however he said it was disappointing; writing was good, but not enough guitar.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book I haven't read anything like it in years I enjoyed it more than the movie. I'm reading the next one it is hard to put down.
0765325950|3.0|i have been reading the wheel of time for nearly 20 years at long last its done with Jordans death it would be a bittersweet experience even if this was a master piece which i am afraid to say its not to be fair its a decent read and sanderson is a accomplished writer who does his best however the fact remains that sandersons strength as a writer lies in different areas then Jordans and the fact that this book centres entirely around the last battle proves a problem because the last battle should be epic a no holds bar fight agaisnt evil blood death mayhem and all that jazz instead we get meh lots and lots of meh.. you have beloved characters killed in a line or two moments built up over the course of the series example the coming of the ogier in the most anti climatic way possible in a couple of throwaway paragraphs<br /><br />the confronation between rand and the dark one becomes not so much a contest between the Avatar of Light and the Eternal source of Evil as a third rate morality play between some imposter posing as rand and a not particularly well written bond villain<br /><br />also the sense of scale Jordan wrote epic in the biggest possible way armies of millions thousands of channelers new shadow spawn ( indeed wheres the worms and other horrors the dark one empties the blight and yet its still pretty much just fades and trollocs) all should be present but no instead we get a few hundred thousand troops and a few hundred channelers i cry foul<br /><br />some other reviewers have likened the way minor and middling characters are killed compared to GRRM however he always writes to have an impact even if its in how casual a character dies here well its more like clearing some closet space you need the room and its a chore you want to get over fast as possible<br /><br />even before Jordans death the wheel of time had become a complicated mess you cant and shouldnt hold Sanderson responsible for that and indeed if you want to fill the void of the wheel of time ending with a new series you could do a hell of a lot worse then stormlight archives sandersons own epic fantasy however you can and should wonder why Sanderson choose to concentrate on relatively minor characters and ignore major ones and while he nailed perrin and much improved writting Mat read Elantris his first fantasy novel and tell me that Sanderson didnt just take the main character put him in the wheel of time and change his name to rand<br /><br />this isnt a bad book maybe realistically it is the best that could be hoped for however it is completely forgettable and that seems more than a little sad for 20 years o a readers commitment<br /><br />ah well as it says in the book its not the ending but it is a ending..
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|The game functioned very well on my Kindle Fire - no problems at all with that.<br /><br />I was intrigued with a game that allowed me to draw my own hero, however I tried the game quite a few times and didn't really care for it due to having some difficulty figuring out the use of dynamite (like others) and became frustrated having to redraw my guy every time I had to restart.
B00A77II0U|3.0|This is a decent little game, but I was expecting to spend most of my time searching for hidden objects, when in fact I spent more time walking back and forth through town ferrying keys from their hiding places to the locks. The game has a hint mechanic in case you aren't sure where the next key is; it gets the job done, but it's a bit annoying in that it has a two-minute cooldown. If you need two hints in close proximity to one another, your only recourse is to stand around and wait for your meter to recharge, which is no fun.<br /><br />The hidden object scenes themselves are pretty enjoyable, and the objects generally blend well with the backgrounds. The game is a bit lacking in variety, though -- the scenes are all pretty much interchangeable, and never deviate far from urban decay with toys and bugs everywhere. The setting and storyline are sufficient to undergird a hidden object game, but largely unremarkable; for the most part, the translation is strong, though it has the occasional howler.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said this game is scary; I did not find this to be the case. Perhaps if you're afraid of broken stuff with mud and bugs on it. I also did not experience any of the technical difficulties other people have mentioned -- the game ran without a hitch on my 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Overall, this game is worth its price if only for the policeman's comical &#34;I can't break in there without a warrant&#34; line in the bonus chapter, which comes after he's broken into basically everything else in town already.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Just not for me.  I did not have any issues with the app as far as functioning (installed it on my Kindle Fire) but it just wasn't a game for me.
B007V80WUC|5.0|Great music from these guys.<br />Awesome voice .<br />They just get better on every album.<br />This is one to have.
0307702103|2.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite writers - but not my favorite narrator. This group of short stories is given only 2 stars based solely on the quality of the narration. It was poorly performed with the sort of amateurish start/stop stutter monotone experienced when many author's read their work - with few exceptions. John Grisham is a most enjoyable and talented writer. His Ford County books have been especially entrancing. The quality of the voice performance was rather agitating so much so that I found I constantly stopped listening to the words.<br /><br />A better recent example of a successful narration is The Racketeer performed by J. D. Jackson. It was entertaining and immediately involving.<br /><br />Ford County audio book was most disappointing. Sorry Mr Grisham but in this case, I'll pass on the audio and give the pager turner a try.<br /><br />DD@Phila
B0087WRGVY|5.0|All songs have great riffs, catchy lyrics and rockin album.<br />If someone likes a good rock album this is the one to get.
B000G8NXYG|4.0|I watched the older version before and I noticed some changes in this one. Some words are different, more cursing, and you can tell between the old subtitles and new ones. I still love this film, despite the length and changes, its still worth watching repeatedly.
B007RXC3A8|5.0|I've loved these guys since i first heard them.<br />This album is more indicative of their style of music as compared to their last album.<br />Great music!!
B005M2V2K8|5.0|Sweet and fluffy, and easy to hold and carry in a back pack to school so she can have a special friend with her.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Pros: simple, practical, low maintenance timepiece at a great value.  Jewlery? No, but wasn't designed for that.<br />Cons: I didn't think I'd be crazy about the watchband, but I will admit that it's growing on me.<br />Why Rating? definitely in the top 20% of satisfied buyers!<br />Who should buy this? someone who is looking for value and practicality.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Great soundtrack!!!!  Love all the songs!! Gave this to my Mom for Christmas and she loved it! highly reccomended for sure!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I rated this four stars because I enjoy playing solitaire!  I also get to choose from several different games, including picking winning games to play!  It helps me to relax and refocus on whatever I am doing.  Thank you, Amazon.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|I went on the internet to get ideas of what to get my BF (he's an audiophile).  The FiiO E7 was one of the suggestions.  Gave it to the BF as his birthday present.  I think it was a hit since he played with it all night.  He liked it so much, he let me play with it, too!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This a quick way to  keep up with what is going on with everyone  when I get on Facebook.It's great to see all the pictures also.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Best TV series I have seen in many a year.  Not at all like Downton Abbey, but just as good.
B0087HT36U|1.0|Game refuses to even open, worked slowly on my older droid x. Get angry birds its a better game and better deal
B009ZUZ9FW|5.0|It is the definitive book on the C Programming Language.  I am ecstatic that is now available as a Kindle Book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't read the book, but my wife did. Thank you!! I couldn't keep her hands off .........the book. Recommend for anyone married longer than 10 years.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I Love the suspense of this book, it was the main reason that I would spend all reading to finish this book! I could not put it down. Of course I saw the movie version of this book first and thought why not read it, but I'm glad I did.
B000005EJL|5.0|I had this on a cassette tape and then a CD.  Wore them both out.  How wonderful to have this back in my collection.  Best CD!
B002RI9MWA|4.0|The Reluctant Fundamentalist gives an insight  into the perspective of those who feel oppressed by US Foreign Policy and practice, in this case the people of Pakistan. The sense of hidden but imminent menace which pervades the book perhaps represents the threat felt by both sides and underpins the ongoing violence.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|very fun addicting game that anyone can play. it is an easy game to figure out and can be played without purchasing all the extra stuff
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really liked this book. I borrowed it from a friend last year and had to buy it for myself because I liked it so much! It is an emotional journey of an introvert boy entering high school. Characters like Patrick and Sam make you wish that try we're your best friends. Charlie is painfully socially challenged at times, but it is still a good book, I recommend it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down! And for a working mother that's nearly impossible.  I want to see it in theaters now!
B004M3H17Q|5.0|Listened to this over and over and over again.<br /><br />I used to be obsessed with Lindisfarne II, before I got the album... would just put that on repeat online.<br /><br />But I finally decided to &#34;take a chance&#34; and get the whole album.....<br /><br />So then I obsessed over &#34;The Wilhelm Scream&#34; omg so amazing.... these two songs along sorta helped me calm down about love (falling in/out of love) ...but the whole album....<br /><br />Really love the Feist cover &#34;Limit to your Love&#34;.... and &#34;Why Don't You Call Me&#34;<br /><br />But sometimes I just listen to this album 2 or 3 times in a row...<br /><br />I've always been a fan of music that really explores sound but I did fear that this would be too much sound and too little music. But somehow it flows into this wonderful, lyrical, poetic piece. It might be haunting for some but I don't feel haunted... He just does such an amazing job of grounding this in gorgeous beats, notes, and tunefulness...<br /><br />I don't know what story he's telling but I love it, whatever it is.<br /><br />Beautiful.
B0086700CM|1.0|If the game provides any explanation of how to play it, I have been unable to find it.  Just frustrating!
0553801473|3.0|This was a gift to my son.  He is reading the series and needed this book.  He like the book.  Delivery was quick.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Story was so-so, couldn't believe some of it. I made it to the end, thankfully. I will not be adding this to the BRay collection.
161383280X|4.0|This was a gift to my son.  He said it arrived quickly and that he really liked the book.  He has read the other books in this series.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|The book was great and the movie wasn't bad. Intense scenes so watch the little eyes when watching. Can't wait for the next movie.
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|Graphics are exact. The touchscreen controls don't really lend themselves to the arcade feel. It's a good free game but I don't think I'd buy it.
B0011UF792|5.0|I enjoy this movie so much & probably have lent it out (or possibly stolen or lost) but was upset when it turned up missing. Thank u for getting me another copy in such a timely & affordable manner.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Was looking for a super small device. This is it! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B004Y042N8|2.0|Simple game that could be an ok time waster if it were better programmed. It would still get dull fast, but might be worth keeping on the phone for an occasional distraction.<br />The fatal problem is the game is programmed to record where your line stops, not where you trace, &amp; fails you if you skip a point. Meaning if you are tracing a straight line from A to D, you can't just drag through the points. You have to stop at B, then trace from B to C, then finally from C to D. There are better free apps avail. Giving it 2 stars- 1 for effort + 1 for relatively few permissions.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|One of my all time favorite space adventures. Wonderfully imaginative and funny as well. A real heart warmer to share with the whole family.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Even though there are few surprises, it is such a touching story, I am so glad that I read it.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|I disliked this book so much that I stopped reading it right after one characters love affair with a mannequin and deleted it from my Kindle.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I wish it didn't go by so quickly! This was a very quick read! Can't wait to start book three!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It wasn't boring at any part.  Just a really good action movie. It did not lack in the acting department either
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Their fun, creative,adventurous,thrilling,exciting,and so much more. They are the best series I have ever read. I will never forget this series and these books.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love seeing all the fairy tale characters in real life especially prince charming and snow white. very easy to get hooked
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I'm only 11 but this was a really good book  at first my mom made me  but I ended up enjoying the books
1433502410|3.0|The quality of construction of this Bible -- at least in its early incarnations, is terrible. Mis-cuts, double-printing, ink inconsistency, pages folded sloppily. I dissected my first copy to see it was really smyth-sewn. At first I thought it was not, and gave it a bad review for that. I am correcting myself here and adding to stars. It is smyth-sewn, but the quality is still lacking. I bought another copy that thankfully came from a newer batch. It doesn't seem to have any noticable defects. Hopefully when you order this, you'll get a copy from 2008 and after.<br /><br />This review has nothing to do with the content, which is excellent.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Okay tried this baby out and low and behold it REQUIRES flash, freaking flash. Which mind you it's suppose to take the place of. Nope frack that. I'd not get this at all.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|sometimes when you enter an event it puts it in correctly.  Most times it puts it on the wrong date twice or doesn't put it in at all.  Got frustrated and removed it from my kindle.  Looking for a better calendar.
B007FH22VQ|5.0|Rough, heavy, and hits you in the chest. Masterpiece! Meshuggah is a staple of metal. This is what the standard for metal should be.
B00846REIS|5.0|Licensed. If u enjoyed 50 shades you'll love this!!!!!!!! Hussein is very much a Christian grey but fighting his own issues
1441965904|3.0|I use this as a text for a graduate presentation course for non-science, non-native speakers and although I really can't find anything better for non-native speakers (and I have spent a fair bit of time looking!), I don't like the organisation (or the fact that it is geared specifically towards science students). Chapter 1 addresses \\"Overall Structure\\", for example, but \\"Introductions\\" aren't covered until Chapter 11, and \\"Writing out your speech\\" is covered in Chapter 2, but Methodology, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion aren't covered until Chapters 13-15. In addition, rather than being collected together each in a single chapter, useful tips related to particular topics are interspersed throughout the book. Although Chapter 17 covers \\"Useful Phrases\\", for example, useful verbs, transitions, and hedges are scattered in various other places, and tips for making better PowerPoint slides have to be consolidated from Chapters 1, 2, 6-9, 12, and 15. With better organisation, my students would no doubt be able to get more out of this book. So, in sum, although others have pointed various positive aspects to this book, I really can't understand what the author and editors where thinking when they decided on the organisation of the chapters/content.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this mystery I was spellbound by the graphics and it wasn't hard to navigate through each section&nbsp;and I can't wait to get  the next one
0143118757|5.0|The book was good and very informational although it reapeated the same thing over and over. It shipped very quickly. No issues.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|In the product description, it doesn't tell you these are wide screen editions.  And that's not totally true because all except one of the DVDs was wide screen.  Random.  I tried to return the DVDs because I didn't want them wide screen, and Amazon charged me a $17 restocking fee, plus some other fees!  I paid about $34 and am getting less than $14 back.  So you better be sure you want these because if not, you're not going to get any money back when you return them.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Good clock app for the kindle fire hd 8.9. Easy to read and see. Has some nice little touches that help give it the higher rating.
B007RI56NY|5.0|What can I say.  . .  I jammed with every tune on the album. Overall - excellent. I had heard a couple tunes from the radio<br />But the other new tunes were absolutely delightful!!  I will be checking Train's other works. Keep on Rockin!! ( - :
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Good battery app for the kindle fire hd 8.9. It is easy to read and adds a quick display located in the kindle drop down .
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is the first book I've read on the Kindle app on my phone.  I love the convenience.  You can carry a book in your pocket or purse to read anywhere.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|And Stay Out Of The Woolworths!<br />I've owned this movie in four different formats, VHS, DVD, HD-DVD, and now Blu-ray. I see something new every time I watch it... love the quotes and the imagery.
B00005LK94|5.0|Good family movie.  Purchased after I watched a Discovery documentary covering this subject.  Would recommend it to families and individuals of all ages.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Believe it or you can travel back in time and live in another era and fall in love with a family who are as real as your own.  Dowton Abby sucks in you from the first episode of the first season.  The more you watch, the more these people become the family you love, and the villains become the people you hate.  Emotions run high, and the love that is shown between both the  heirs of  Downton Abby, and the staff that keeps it running, is remarkable. The history of the era is remarkably well done and believable. I'm not sure how I will ever be able to let go of all the characters in this superb show, and will no doubt carry them in my memory forever.  Never have I felt this way about a TV series.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|This is a great driving simulation.  If you are looking to simulate steering with a kindle and hitting people until your car bursts into flames.  Would be an offensively violent game, until you realize those things that look like people are actually mutants and not people and mutants deserve to get intentionally hit by cars, so it's all good.  You know what?  It's not all good.  This game is just too violent.  And it ought to have a gas pedal so you can accelerate into the people I mean mutants.  And maybe a break pedal so you come to a stop on one of their heads and then floor the gas and peel out.  A better idea might be to download Paplinko.  It doesn't have a gas or brake pedal either but that's ok because it's not a driving game so that makes sense.  I bet that little star guy can drive real good because anybody who can breakdance like that can probably drive well.  Download Paplinko and find out!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I love the story line! From the beginning it was pretty fast paced! And I thought that the graphics were great!  I hope that they make a part 2 !
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this so fast, even w an annoyingly busy schedule. The story is compelling and keeps you moving to the next chapter. Some of the twists I saw coming but still couldn't put it down. The first book was great but this was even better
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I played this game on my Kindle Fire with no problems at all.  Beginning of game is free with $2.99. cost to complete it which is worth the price.  Game is challenging without being frustrating.  Graphics are outstanding and although this is a hidden object game it includes lots of mini puzzles.  Storyline is strong which makes it a first class hidden object game.  I just which it was longer though it took several hours of casual play to complete...I just did not want it to end.  Great graphics, price, storyline and challenge...what more could you want for hours of entertainment!  Only reason it is not a 5 rating is it could have been longer.  Otherwise it is great!
B007THA4FI|3.0|Lots of characters. Convoluted. Would not have finished it except it was my book club choice. Enjoyed the setting, good description of some characters
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have never found a book that could keep me interested but I couldn't put this one down! Ready to read the second book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Have to read the next book.<br />Very intense and keeps you on the edge the whole way through. Children who need to survive on their own.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Its a good Prossesor for video games, run games like league of legends, good relation frames per seconds in all video games, accompanied evga gtx 55o Ti , I am very pleased to have made ​​this purchase, good price and value relationship
0307456633|3.0|This title manages to give you a taste of the local culture while at the same time breaking gender barriers.<br /><br />This is not they typical in your face who done it. The main character, who is a mystery herself, reveals her story in mini escapades. As each case is brought to fore there is plenty of time to contemplate how it should be solved, and to envision the family dynamics or circumstances of the clients.<br /><br />In a word this book is *** Quaint *** and gives you more then meets the eye.
B005LAII08|5.0|I liked the 3D quality, and the story line was quite exceptional, the music was very good with all the sound and words of wisdom.
0385360169|5.0|This is an enjoyable read, The book is never slow, I enjoyed it so much I purchased copies and gave them out for Christmas presents.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome<br />Cant wait to get more horses.  Easy to play very entertaining.  Great for kids of all ages.  Got to have it.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Don't have showtime so couldn't wait to buy this and we weren't disappointed.  We're passing it on to our friends and looking forward to the new season.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Another Grisham story of someone getting their hands on a large chunk of cash (or gold) while dodging the legal system and trying to convert it to living happy ever after in the carribean.
0765325950|5.0|This book is the epic ending to the best fantasy ever written. Every major storyline is tied up and the action picks up and never lets up. It's the perfect ending to an amazing series. Buy it, you will not regret it. Plus, your wrists/arms could use a little exercise, they are getting too weak from your light e-readers.<br /><br />I loved it and was satisfied with every bit of it. If you have followed the Wheel of Time series this will be the most satisfying ending you have ever experienced.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this was the best book so far, in my opinion. I can' t wait until the next book is released! 5 stars!
B008HK3XU4|3.0|At first I liked this case a lot.  Then after light use, the edges of the case started to wear off and the purple color wore through to the very obvious white underneath.  I have colored it with a purple marker so that the wear wasn't so obvious, but I don't think that it should be doing this already.  I also worry that after a while the elastic that is used to prop up the kindle will stretch out because of how far i have to stretch it to keep it upright.  It works to protect the kindle, but I would have liked it to be a bit more durable for the price.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game! It's kind of like &quot;Temple Run&quot; in a way, because you keep running (or jetpacking) to get coins and stuff. A guy I know reccomended it to me and a bunch of my friends and two brothers got the game. super cool and addicting!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|My only hint of a problem was he tried to do 4 points of view and the book got a bit off-tempo.
B004UID2LC|3.0|So this app worked worked great at first. I can honestly say it was my favorite thats why i gave it 3 stars. Anyway it stopped working suddenly and it just wouldn't download anything at all. So i sadly had to delete it and it took me a long time to finally find an app that at least worked  to download my music so i would recommend not to get this app and instead get youtube to mp3 for your music:)
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Wow this book was great!  I had not heard about this author before and I can't wait to read another book of his.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my son who loved these for his games. They work really well and he absolutely loves them.
B000002MUN|5.0|I purchased this for my Dad for Christmas. He listens to it all the time. Price was very low on this CD.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved everything about this book but especially the lessons to be learned by never giving up for what you believe in.  This story written from a dog's point of view was incredible.  You will laugh and cry if you read this book!
B000031XCR|5.0|Awesome CD! This was a Christmas gift for my Mom, she loved it. Shipped fast! Lots of good songs on this CD.
B000000OTY|5.0|This is a hard CD to find. I bought mine used - better than expected. Arrived as predicted, great price, great dealer.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I love this album and would recommend it to anyone. Great movie and great vocalists<br /> Ester Dean is a genius
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Outstanding DVD - well produced. I will admit - you need to be a David Gilmore fan to fully appreciate this concert DVD. Just being a Pink Floyd fan is not enough. Some segments can be boring, but his guest appearances did a supurb job of accompanying him on some ol' classics.<br /><br />DVD arrived as forecast and in great condition.
B002KKCVWI|4.0|I've worn Tevas for decades.  I've tried other brand sandals but they always seem inferior to Tevas.  These were great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started to read this book, it felt like I was stuck in a weird teenage soap opera. Thankfully, the author does a very good job at keeping your attention and you want to read what happens next. This book keeps you guessing. As you read, you can start piecing together the story, but it still had a few spots that I didn't see coming.
B003MAQM6Q|2.0|I thought about turning it off half way through but I stuck with it.  Some interesting plot twists.  But I wish I had streamed it free rather than paying for it.  I feel like I wasted the money
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Well written, contemporary, perfectly cast.  Thriller, exciting and realistic.<br />Damien is spot on in the lead role.<br />Claire is awesome!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This was so well written, a real page turner. Really gives insight into what is happening over seas in the middle east
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It does what is advertised.  The buttons are easy to see and use with the touch screen.  I would recommend it.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|These two actor's are great together. I really hope this does not end this season. Such good entertainment and great acting, love it!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game is the pinnacle of addictive.  While I love to play and get rapped up in it, it is a serious time sucker.
B008CIUS72|1.0|This app doesn't work! I tried to load a local SWF file from my Kindle Fire Tablet but as soon as I pressed open it gave me an error message &quot;Flash player not installed. Please install flash player&quot; But that's what THIS app is supposed to be right? Wrong! It then automatically opens Amazon app store for me where I get another error message &quot;the app you are looking for is no longer available&quot;. That's it folks. It simply does not do what it's supposed to do. I wish I could get my money back. Buyer beware! Do not download!
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl is well written with an unusual plot line.  I found it held my attention.  Except for occasional repititions and perhaps too many characters to sort out it deserves a four star rating.  Well worth the time. - Joyce McDonald, author of The Benediction.
B00A6N8YTU|4.0|All around good movie.  Good acting, plot is decent and liked the ending.  &#34;Good&#34; torture scene.  Wrong guys to mess with!
B006LSZECO|4.0|THIS BOOK WAS HARD TO GET interested in at first. I am glad I stayed with it! It turned out to be a good read.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|Yes, I would recommend this movie to 50+<br />Funny and inspiring!<br />We have been married 33 years and it made us more thankful for each other.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|What can I say - put Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock together and it just works.  I love this movie!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book captures your attention on the first page..I love the way it was layed out diary style. You will not regret starting this book.
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary is simple to use and has a wide vocabulary selection.  I use it for studying my textbooks for quick reference when I encounte r unknown words.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Brilliantly written. I could not put it down. Dr. Alexander combined science and spirituality in a most poetic and compelling story, whether you believe his conclusion or not. A must read.
B004CGCCFY|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter but we all love it. Classic music on vinyl with a song book just can't be found anymore
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Look very nice and stick to the walls very well even I changed their location few times, trying to make design. Better quality than Blue Mountain's brand.
1607066017|4.0|I actually just finished reading it and I found it to be a really good read. Brian K. Vaughn has crafted a pretty great world that already has me interested in what vol. 2
B009LA1QW6|5.0|If you love Lana Del Rey then you definitely need this ep. It compliments the &#34;Born To Die,&#34; album very well but stands strong alone as well. I love every track on this album!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We just hopped on the &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; train.  And we love this series!  Highly recommend.  You should definitely check it out.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark Places is a great mystery novel. Gillian's work gets better and better. I really enjoy the change in POV from one chapter to the next.
6305428050|5.0|THIS MOVIE (WHICH I THINK IS GOING OUT OF PRINT) IS ONE OF THE MOST ORIGINALLY FUNNY MOVIES I EVER SAW.  WELL WRITTEN, WELL ACTED.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love this type ot game. this one was a little hard to remember how to get to all the different places,  I had to use the hint button a lot to guide me through. but still fun!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Great writing and acting made this a fun series to watch.  I really missed this Doctor after he regenerated, but then I came to like the next one.
B000W965QW|3.0|Fine book, written with a lot of adult pathos.  It really didn't hold my attention, just mildly interesting.  Maybe best demographic could be younger adult male?
B006LSZECO|3.0|I like the author in that she keeps you interested in the story and characters.  IMHO, this book was good up until the end.  It was anti-climatic and I believe I could have written a better ending!  Not to give anything away about the story....but I felt that one of the characters was too ruthless to end in a positive conclusion.  I liked Sharp Objects better.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This is more than just zombies. It shows how the human mind is twisted by the events that surround it. Nature vs nurture people.
B0027MJU00|5.0|A good story that keeps you guessing clear till the end. I enjoyed it very much. She wraps up all the threads and gives you all the answers by the end of the book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app because it does what its supposed to and it cost me nothing! Most free apps have glitches or its not the complete game but this app allows all the changes the Solitaire on your computer allows and then some. It allows you to change the background, the card design on the back, and even the style of cards its pretty neat for a free app!
B000HAB4SU|5.0|I admit that I have never heard of Firefly prior to the boom of the internet streaming era. I never had cable, not will i ever, but I love watching television.<br /><br />I was so amazed and engaged in this show, that I kept yearning for more, but there was no more. The voyage has ended so abruptly. Sure there was a movie few years later, but I wanted another 15-20 episodes. It was that good, the crew had a good mixture of personality and chemistry.<br /><br />Then I Googled it and realize how much of a cult favorite this show it.<br /><br />If your a Sci-Fi fan, you will love this show without a doubt. And if your a Castle watcher, you will love Nathan Fillion on this show too.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|cute fun and easy to play<br />the animals are cute and its free<br />they didn't make it so all the good ones cost money<br />which is awesome
B007GFDVEE|4.0|my son loves his batman LEGO he plays with it all the time but watch out cause he will lose the parts
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great story here. It's contemporary, suspenseful, and enough relationship stuff to make it plausible. The only way to watch it is to own the whole season (Season 1 is all that's available now) so that you can watch more than one episode at a time. Good, Good !!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Although it's slower than the season 1, it's still good in terms of human drama and how the each character develops. Love it.<br />Cant't wait for the next season
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. It is a truly inspiring story about love and life. Enzo, as one of man's most trusted friends, tells the story of his (and his human's) life. He gleans what it means to be human, and in turn shares a wisdom that would have otherwise been lost. There are many powerful words in this story, all of which have been crafted beautifully into a true literary masterpiece. This story will make you laugh, it will make you feel joy, and it will make you cry, but, more importantly, it will make you think.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I can't belive I have to wait for another half of the season.... I can't wait!<br />The story is so unpredictable and so good!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. Was a great ending with so much action. Can't wait to see if the movie is half as good as the book.
B0049VZ222|5.0|too good! I can't stop watching! It's not about zombie but it's about what people do at the moment of crisis. It's about real human nature....
B0063GORYU|4.0|Glad to have one of my favorite PC games available to play on the Kindle Fire. I've always enjoyed playing Spider
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I love how they combined all their apps into one.  Easy to use and the count down helps you to see how much time you have left.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|Didn't realize it is mechanical, requiring motion to keep time.  Have returned it.  I must have misread the description.  The watch is good looking, however.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I  was so caught up in the story I was surprised when it ended.  Lots of fun.  I would suggest this collection to any on<br />e
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|This movie was ok. As a parent I prefer not to expose my children to certain language and this movie actually had some that surprised me. There are hints of homosexuality from a character (which is fine) but, I rather be the one to talk to my children about that and not a movie. I do like the fact that the movie talks about ghosts and that Norman can 'speak' to them. I would suggest that parents review this film prior to letting their children watch so you can be sure that this is something that you are okay with having your children watch.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Itd be an easy five star if cash and energy were easier to get. The people that made this game want to make money so bad that it takes away from the game, it's very unfortunate.
B0063GORYU|5.0|In love with this game. Works great and very enjoyable. I spend a lot of time playing this game. I recommend this game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is an inconclusive story.....some of it did not fit the story line....espically the &#34;stealing fish&#34; part when Amy was hiding at the tourist camp.  I would read no more by this author.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not a book reader usually, but this trilogy was recommended by a friend and once I started reading I could not stop! Can't wait to read the 3rd book!
1439152802|5.0|I read this book based on both the reviews and a recommendation from Amazon, and was not disappointed. The character development is first-rate and the story incorporates history and drama in a way that pulls the reader in immediately. I am not often surprised by a story's ending, but this one totally caught me off guard. I look forward to reading other stories by this author.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Since reading [[ASIN:B00AQIQ8KW Free Kindle Fire Apps That Don't Suck: The Complete (120+) Top Free Kindle Fire Game Apps (Top Free Kindle Fire Apps)]] I've tested out a good number of game apps. With Angry Birds, Rovio created a new genre of game app, which has been copied by many competitors (some of which are actually quite good), but Angry Birds remains the best in breed.<br /><br />The Good:<br />- Graphics and sound are best in class<br />- Solid build, works great on the Kindle Fire<br />- Easy to learn and to play<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- Only works in one landscape mode<br /><br />The Bottom Line: Angry Birds is one of the most successful game apps in the short history of game apps. It's so popular because (among other reasons) it's easy and fun to play, and the difficulty level ramps up comfortably. The Kindle Fire version is solid, and looks and sounds great.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Our whole family loves it!! It works great on the fire. I appreciate that there is nothing punitive that could frustrate children (or grown ups). If you don't get to the coins in time they automatically go to your account.<br /><br />And there is a great surprise once you purchase the movie theater!!
B0043RSK3K|5.0|A trip back in time! Reading it feels like you are traveled back in time.Very detailed narrative of events that impacted world history. Awsome!
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|Except, I believe, it should have been included in the purchase price of the Kindle Fire HD. But at least now I can use the camera.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i can keep up with my family and friends down in wayland ky .and around the other parts of the unite states
0446554995|5.0|This latest book of the Pendergast series does not disappoint!  It's full of brilliant plot twists, emotional drama and<br />heart pounding adventure. Can hardly wait for the next installment!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is a lot of fun passes time away and ifu play the game enough u will get addicted like me
B000020617|5.0|Foo fans, this is THE album to have if you truly want to hear the pinnacle of the collection. Dave, Nate, and Taylor create music as a trio that top the charts, winning numerous awards including the Grammy for best rock Album in 2000. Resulting in 5 chart-topping songs, as well as a second grammy for best short-form music video in 2001. This album radiates a unique feel of complete relaxation and reflection, while still maintaining enough excitement to keep you enclosed in the flowing sounds of a true light-rock set-list. One of very few albums by any band that has the ability to be listened to from beginning to end without skipping a song. The album's simple instrumentals and soft, liquid tones flow with your mood, relating to every aspect of life in the slow-lane. This is not your typical Foo album, it actually manages to outclass them all, which is why we rate this masterpiece at a 5 of 5. Enjoyable by all.<br /><br />Songs of Interest:<br />-Learn to Fly<br />-Gimme Stitches<br />-Generator<br />-Aurora<br />-Next Year<br />-Ain't it the Life
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. It was a great story line. I can't wait till May, for the next book to be released. Wish there was fewer grammar mistakes, but I guess that is expected when reading it on an e-reader.
B0000CAXID|4.0|This self-titled former mix-tape is the Foo Fighter's Debut album, and a solid one at that! For Foo fans this is a necessary album. Recorded by Dave Grohl alone, this album was created before the actual band was formed. The distorted sounds and hard lyricim provide for an all-out jam album that is ideal for grunge and punk enthusiasts. An album worth its salt. 4 of 5, a solid album.<br /><br />Songs of Interest:<br />-This is a Call<br />-Big Me<br />-Oh, George<br />-Exhausted
B009EHDU7U|5.0|I was reading this book whilst on holidays with friends.  They wondered why I was laughing at every turn of the page.  This dear old man continued his life journey by meeting up with some strange characters and adventures and considering his previous life this is not surprising.  The author makes a seamless change between what is happening now and the main character's previous experiences.  I am sure there will be more people reading this book based on my enjoyment and recommendation.
B004LUHQ1G|3.0|The Foo's latest release is no doubt enjoyable, but for our tastes, there is a lack of artistry in this album. It gives off the feeling that there was no real purpose to this album apart from making noisy hard-rock to gain attention.  The return of Pat Smear to the group has caused a chaotic mess of too many guitars that is not easy on the ears, and Dave Grohl has resorted to too much Growl. 3 of 5 stars, an album easily forgotten.<br /><br />Songs Of Interest:<br />-Rope<br />-Arlandria
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Great page turner and an unexpected ending - one I didn't guess - the first one in ages.<br />I enjoyed much more than her previous one and better than the one before that.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works great.  Fun to play on kindle and iPhone.  Never any problems.<br />Love the autocomplete and graphics<br />Fun for everyone
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book and easy read when short on time. Gideon Cross is one hot and turmoiled man.  This series is a lot like the Fifty Shades series, but just as good I think.
0765325950|4.0|I have to say, I'm disappointed in reading some of these reviews. Disregarding the idiotic, inane reviews that do nothing but complain about the delay of the ebook release, I feel that some people are being unfair in giving this book one or two star reviews.<br /><br />This book is not perfect. I will freely admit that. But how could it have been? Given that BS had very little to actually work with, this book is brilliant. I doubt that even Jordan could have finished this book in a way that would have satisfied everyone. Why? He built his world to be too large and too complex for one series to contain. You have to compare it to LOTR: Tolkien built a MASSIVE world with histories, legends and all other sorts of background to set his main series in. But you don't get a lot of that information unless you read supplementary books, such as the Silmarillion. With Jordan, he tried to pack the Silmarillion of WOT into the WOT itself. That is why the books are so long, the characters so numerous and the plot details a nightmare, I'm sure, to completely wrap up. BS has done the best he can with what he was given. It is very difficult to write someone else's characters and world; I've read enough poor fanfiction to know.<br /><br />When Jordan died, many people were upset, not just at his untimely death but at the thought of this masterful series remaining undone. When I heard that BS was taking over the plot, I was overjoyed. After reading his works, he has probably become one of my favorite authors. BS adds measures of humor and a different spin on the characters that are quite different from Jordan. But different doesn't equal bad. Some people reviewing this book seem to have forgotten that. And when they criticize the book, they offer examples that speak of minutia being unobserved. Given that BS has a life and other books to write, tiny plot details that do or do not make an appearance are trivial. I doubt he had time to reread and make careful notes of all the books, which would have been necessary to get everything perfectly right. Jordan is as much to blame himself for creating such an elaborate world.<br /><br />So no, the book isn't perfect, but it's stupid to expect it to be. As a long-time fan of the series who started reading these books at 10 years old, I give this book four stars because it was a satisfying ending, moved at a good pace, and remained reasonably in-character. Did some things get left hanging? Yes. Would Jordan himself have summed everything up? Dunno. For what it is, this book is well worth the wait and the read.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good book. Filled with interesting characters and a good storyline. Breckin was such a great character. Wish the author had included him more into the story. All in all, this book will not disappoint.
B00742GBDM|5.0|Thia is a great story put together with talented actors. Tha picture was clear with no distortions. Movie played immediately after purchase with no problems.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love love this game . The music is soothing and relaxing .the game gives you a challenge. The fact that you can play along time for free before you buy it is awesome
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I chose 3 stars because you already know what is going to happen. It was well written. I would recommend to teens and adults.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Its is really fun and very addictive i play it all the time i love it best game ever 5star
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I bought this game due to the user reviews explaining how great this game is. It's all true! This game cleverly brings you back to the days when games were very simple and need only a joystick and one button, even though it takes full advantage of the PS3 Six Axis controller like a charm! The graphics are pretty good, although not too fancy, but they're adequate for setting the mood of the game. The sound track is what makes the game remarkable, however. Very well done.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Slow at first as she builds on all the characters, halfway through I could not put it down! Depressing but good!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|nice that there was a movie with a different take on vampires but I am a bit over the vampire stuff everywhere at this point.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Pete Townshend's memoir is exactly as titled: \\"Who 'I' Am. In other words, it's all about Pete. That's fine - and what a memoir is normally about. But Townshend has never been a major solo icon (sorry fan club members). Yes, he's had solo success as a writer and artist, but is known best as a member of The Who. His greatest triumphs - \\"Tommy,\\" Woodstock, \\"Quadrophenia\\" and sold-out tours were as part of a group. A very famous group that is recognizable for the \\"sound\\" they created together, sold millions of records, and is in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But in this book, his bandmates are barely more than extras in the background. Townshend spends more time describing his boats and the audio equipment in his many home-based recording studios, instead of (for instance) meeting John Entwistle (a childhood friend), major disagreements with Roger Daltry (except once describing how Roger knocked him out), and more insights into the joys and frustrations that had to be daily events while working with the self-destructive Keith Moon.<br />Again, it is Townshend's story and he's very frank and honest in telling it. His mental state and musical muse always seem to be in question. He also talks about his battles with alcohol, drugs, relationships and sex. But mostly it's about his creative process. The results were always more artistic and ambitious in comparison to projects by most of his pop / rock peers. But the leader of one of the world's top rock bands (that position would be argued by Roger Daltry) should be expected to shine more light on the artistic and creative project - The Who - that made him famous in the first place.
0307277887|5.0|The whole series is wonderful and much different than the tv show. A must read for any dexter tv show fan.
B004YKB4JS|5.0|I have had this CD before but misplaced it. This was cheaper than my original one! Came within a week. Great service.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|AWESOME!!!!  look forward to season 3 and season 2 is not finished yet! thank God for amazon instant video, I no longer have cable so I can order these on my roku!
B0064NTZJO|3.0|This is a pretty good movie, not great, but good, slow at times but entertaining.  I enjoyed it and Golslin was excellent.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I really liked all MIBs but this one imo was the best one yet. I liked that they also really tell the back story to both agents too! Definitely worth renting!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|After having read and re-read 50 Shades, I had the hardest time separating Ana & Christian from any other couple I read about. The reviews for Hopeless were so positive that I read the sample and knew I had to buy it and continue the story. I finished the book in one night. Well past my bed time, I HAD to know how it ended.<br /><br />My main love of this book was that it was nothing like 50 Shades (shocking!). I thought I had been ruined on books forever (I know 50 Shades isn't pulitzer worthy, but I just got so sucked in!). Hopeless was the book I had needed after 50 Shades and though it took months, I'm glad I stumbled upon it.<br /><br />Delving into topics that are serious and that I typically steer away from, it had me. I was hooked. The writing, the story line, the characters. It was just refreshing. It felt real.<br /><br />If you're looking for another couple to obsess over and root for, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />After Hopeless, I went backwards and read the author's debut Slammed. A definite shift but you can clearly see the growth from her first two books to where she brings you in Hopeless.<br /><br />I'll definitely be re-reading this one.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I loved this season! I bought this for my daughter for Christmas since I got her hooked on AHS Asylum - she comes over just to watch it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was so much better then the movie. Great story  looking forward to the story to continue. Five star
0439813786|5.0|After reading \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabaret\\", I felt a sense of utter amazement! Brian Selznick has out done himself. The book is a fantastic story about a clock maker's son, Hugo, who holds a secret. This secret has a key to the past, present and future. Forced by circumstances to make his own way in the world Hugo has to turn to a life of stealing and scrounging. After a series of seemingly unfortunate events, this path leads him on a magical journey of discovery.<br />I would definitely recommend this award winning book to anyone of any age. My 2nd grader loved it as did I! It's everything you want in a book: fantastic illustrations, mystery, intrigue, magic, humor, sadness and love. I promise you wont be able to put it down once you start!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|The story is corny and predictable.  Acting doesn't rise up beyond the material except for Tom Cruise who takes his best stab at Axel Rose.  Alec Baldwin is funny solely because he seems to know what a mess it is and doesn't take it too seriously.  the soundtrack mashes together a bunch of songs that only makes them seem sappy.  Avoid.
0307895475|5.0|Elder Scrolls V gamer manual<br /><br />For any Skyrim fan out there, this book may as well be the Skyrim bible. I recommend this book highly to anyone who is either already or thinking about playing the game. I completed the main quest without the aid of this book but after receiving the book and reading through it, I learned that I missed a lot and didn’t even know it. There is a wealth of knowledge that you would never know or find from solely game play.<br /><br />The purchasing of this book will maximize your gaming experience to the fullest extent.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I love this game and was very excited to find it for the Kindle Fire! This app was done very well and worth the cost. Play is the same as the board game. You can play against the computer or pass your device back and forth with a friend. Super Awesome!
B008ASLK8A|2.0|He seemed more full of him self and pretentious on a whole new level in this movie. Honestly it was well made, but it just bored me. I didnt even finish it. I did like the first movie though (2010)
B005K2Z2O2|4.0|Very light-weight and sturdy.  Works great for traveling.  I recommend it to anyone who travels often and is searching for these features.
B005N95JA4|5.0|awesome. Gave as a gift and my brother loved it. I should buy one for myself. Yeah, I should. Shouldn't I
B005KJZDXK|4.0|These guys do great renditions of the classics.  Zoe is a better singer than one might expect and that is kinda cool.
B002RAREAK|5.0|What can I say about Usher this also is my second cd because the other one got broke and my son love Usher music
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Astounding game.  I highly recommend this game. One of the best games I have played in a long time. cant wait for G5 to best this one.
B00933JF74|5.0|My 11 year old son loves this game because he can build towns.  He enjoys those kinds of games.  A really good game, in his opinion.
B005LAIISU|5.0|I love the Ice Age movies great movie with a cast of great actors. Great movie to watch with the family.
B0085KGGHI|4.0|I gave this to my husband for Christmas because he had been watching it on PBS.  He seems to like it though I have not seen him play it much since the holiday.  He plays guitar and Loves the work that Muddy Waters did.  Thought he would like to add it to his collection.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I have to use this program for my cheap polaroid tablet that i got at biglots and I love my tablet it does it all, but the amazon marketplace is junk. U use it once and it works, then it just doesnt launch. You have to delete it and reload it everytime. Its just stupid. I wouldnt recommend it.... its awful!
0810989956|4.0|I purchased this for my granddaughter because she has been reading these books.  She liked it and added it to her collection.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|will make your music a bit louder at the cost of distorting your precious sound clarity, I chose loudness over clearness when i got this thing to workout with and I'm pretty sad. It is a self sufficient little device in terms of battery so you can't do anything but use it grudgingly.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|New TV! New DVD player!  All with 3D option! Avitar 3D was my first purchase from Amizon my new way to get the stuff I love, fast, easy and at a low price! Thanks!!
B002M87V0A|3.0|mediocre musical at best. very drawn out and disconnected in parts. it was no \\"the king and i\\" or \\"the sound of music\\"
B007VUA7VO|4.0|My wife first downloaded this app to her KFHD and loved it so I decided to give it a try...  So far it has been a great addition to my app collection - definitely added to my favorites!  It is very easy to use and very easy to read.  It gives you accurate readouts on a beautiful display.  We are very pleased and recommend this app.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This was a fascinating read with applications in in many aspects of life! I especially found the insight into business practices to be very interesting.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Very exciting book hard to put down.  I think older teenage kids should read this book.  I would share this with my daughter.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show on television according to me... second only to HBO's Game Of Thrones. This season has a couple of moments that will blow fans minds
B003O86FMW|4.0|I believe this book to be very thrilling and mysterious,that is why I give it four stars for the second book of the trilogy.  I recommend this to older teenagers.  I would share this with daughter.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is not the typical type of books i would read but from the very beginning I was captured by the deep meaning  behind Pi's extraordinary journey. I loved understanding his thoughts on religion family and life. I enjoyed this bored so much.
076781326X|5.0|Amazing Movie.  We have watched it over 5 times.  My children love it.  My 10 year old just got cast in the musical Oliver - so this was a perfect gift.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The only downside is the extra data adding in the beginning but its only once and even though i paid $7 dollars its totally worth it!!! btw i have a game review website which u can checkout called [...]…on VGB terms i would give this game a 9.5!

B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was purchased for my son. He really enjoys the Batman series and was happy to receive this DVD especially along with his new Blu-ray DVD player.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Too much police administrative detail included; slowed up the story,  Otherwise, the action story and the witty dialogue were entertaining.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My daughter liked this book a lot. She said this book is her favorite ever!!!! She said it was really funny!!
B003JBHQP4|5.0|I always try to buy AmazonBasics products since I feel that Amazon stands behind them.  I have NEVER been disappointed.  I have used other readers and this is just as good as those costing much more.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|Bought it back in June when I was told to lose weight and change my diet due to diabetes.  My numbers went from 188/8.1 to 109/6.0 for my latest blood tests, weight 250 to 198 as of 1/16/13. Although still not eating bread, pasta, rice or potatoes (don't miss them yet) that you can eat in moderation with Atkins I am still looking for another 13 pounds by June for my first attempt at a triathlon at age 60.  Try it, it works!
B009LMBVTW|5.0|The Velvet Underground were 30 years ahead of their times, unfortunately we had to wait 44 years for this to be released officially. The vinyl version of this show (released in 1983), edited of course, practically formed the alternative music esthetic. In the period of April 1967 to March 1969, the velevets played Cleveland 7 times, five times at the basement club called LA CAVE. A former coffeehouse, it just helt 250-300 people, with tickets $3.50 each. The house PA was just VOT's powered by a low tech amp. On October 2, 1968 the Velvets came in for a three night stand. And, its Doug Yule's first public appearace with the band.<br /><br /> The Velvets opened their second set with this nasty little one chord throw away, MOVE RIGHT IN (2:41). They moved into I CANT STAND IT (7:58), with Lou playing one of those Cecil Taylor inspired, chaos solos. WHAT GOES ON (5:27) has Doug Yule on bass, before he moved over to organ. Once more, Lou goes berserk with his solo. If you have the VELVET UNDERGROUND 5CD boxset from 1995, you can listen to what this particular recording of WHAT GOES ON actually sounds like. (Its the first song on CD4) The sound quality for this song runs thru the whole show. Next comes WAITING FOR THE MAN. (6:08) It's the slow version of the song, slinky and sexy. PALE BLUE EYES (7:35) has Lou singing his most beautiful lyric. Its unfortunate the crowd likes to talk, cos they were missing a great song. However...the vocal mic kicks out during the first chorus. So Lou just starts the song over. Play this for people who think Lou doesnt have a good voice. Notable for the different lyrics. Here's verse #2:<br /><br />Sister Jane went down to Mexico<br />She was all over the world<br />She came back and she was all shot full of holes<br />She's such a funny kind of girl<br />She's such a funny kind of girl<br /><br />FOGGY NOTION (10:54) was only known as a dried out husk on Lou's first solo album, but here it pulsates with fire and energy.<br />HEROIN (7:17) is heroin, with Doug's organ replacing the viola part. Moe sounds great on this one. JESUS (5:26), a lovely duet sung by Lou and Moe harmonizing off key, has a drum part for some reason, all tom toms and bass drum. VENUS IN FURS (4:13) isnt the song it was with John's viola part, but this sounds pretty cool anyway. BEGINNING TO SEE THE LIGHT (6:30) cooks just right, one of the stand out numbers from the 3rd LP. The tempo shifts and the harmonies are all there for your enjoyment. Which brings us to SISTER RAY (10:38). At just over 10 minutes, this is practically the 45 single version, compared to the 38 minute version from THE QUINN TAPES. The previous show at LA CAVE with John Cale in April 30, 1968 contained a 39 minute version of SWEET SISTER RAY, moving into SISTER RAY, MR RAIN, VENUS IN FURS, and HEROIN. Maybe we can hear that on an offical release too? This evening's second set ends with STORY OF MY LIFE (1:57). After sounding like every avant guard band imaginable, they play a 2 minute pop song. And it swings.<br /><br />Okay, its going to be irritating for some people, when they hear the sound quality of the tape. But what you lose in sound quality, you gain in some of the best rock ever recorded. If you're a fan of this band, you simply need this CD. Its historical value can't be overstated. Most of these songs weren't even recorded yet, and at least 8 of these songs are being played for the first time. You might listen to this CD a lot, or not. But you'll definately turn it all the way up when you do listen to it.is heroin, with Doug's organ replacing the viola part. Moe sounds great on this one.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Thought this might be a typical &#34;tense thriller&#34; about a possible murder mystery - but it was so much more.  The look into the interior monologues going on inside the husband's head vs. a wife's head around the same incidents was fascinating.  Flynn writes in two such distinct voices, you feel you get to know these two different people intimately and yet they constantly surprise you.  I found myself stealing away time to get back to this book as the story unfolded with more and more unanticipated twists.  Gone Girl was a compelling read from the first page to the last.
0307747883|4.0|This book is very well read but we found it hard to follow the characters when it is being read to us.  We got it for our 7 year old and she was clearly not interested.  We will save it for when she is a little older.  It takes a bit of practice for this visual generation to learn how to &#34;listen&#34; to books.
0763644765|5.0|Grand kids love this book. It's durable and stands up to having toddlers carry it around. They love the pictures and story line.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Interesting book and a good read, but I just could never shake the 'this is EXACTLY like X-men' thought in the back of my head while reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I first heard about WOOL from a review of one of my books, where someone used Mr. Howey's book to disparage mine, by way of talking about how awesome WOOL is. I filed the title away for future reference for when I was looking for something new to read. A few weeks later, WOOL came up in conversation with some friends. One of my friends had read it and gave it rave reviews. So, I thought I'd check it out. I read most of the WOOL Omnibus Edition on my flights to and from last year's World Science Fiction Convention, and I must say, I'm glad I did. What a perfect traveling companion.<br />I'm not a big fan of dystopian science fiction, mostly because few writers have the skill to handle the transition of our current culture to whatever dark future they have imagined for their story. My most frequent frustration in these stories is that the dystopia becomes the vehicle for the story, the reason for it, and the characters just wander around in the setting so the writer can show off how bleak and grim everything is.<br /><br />Not so with this book. In WOOL,  Huge Howey shows us a  world- building masterpiece. He gives us characters that we care about and sympathize with first and foremost, well before we see how bleak and grim the world of WOOL truly is. We discover the conspiracies and lies along side the characters, which makes their shock, our shock - their horror at the realization of how terrible the world has become is our horror as well.<br /><br />And within the plots, schemes, conspiracies, and overpowering bleakness that the protagonists discover surrounding them, there is also hope. In most other dystopian science fiction I've read, where any hope the protagonists spy in the distance serves only as a device by which the writer can further prove how terrible his or her vision of the future is by ripping that hope to shreds, leaving the characters to recover in the wake of this shredding. WOOL counters this by having the elements of hope come not from plot points strategically placed in the story, but rather from the characters' own ingenuity and resourcefulness, which is a refreshing change of pace.<br /><br />The fifth book in the omnibus ties up the current story line very nicely, yet leaves it open for many many more, as Howey indicates in his personal afterward at the end. I am eagerly awaiting the third of the SHIFT stories to be published later this year (2013) so I can dive into those as well. Hopefully after that, we'll return to the characters from these stories.<br /><br />With WOOL, Hugh Howey has placed himself among the greats of speculative fiction's finest writers, and it would not surprise me in the least to see his name on a ballet for a Hugo or Nebula in the next few years.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is an excellent series, it may be disturbing for some folks to watch because its present day and all very possible!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I never thought i would find a calendar that was so easy to use yet did eveything i needed it to do. i had given up on electronic ones and had gone back to the wall calendars. bad thing about those is you never had them when u needed them. i was so thrilled when i read the excerpt from this calendar that i gave it a try right away. low and behold everything worked and exceeded my expectations. Thank u CalenGoo and Gunia UG for bringing me back to civilization! I recommend this calendar to everyone!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show, I especially love Maggie Smith, her character is great!  I highly recommend this show.<br />You will enjoy it.
0738711500|5.0|this set was worth every penny. It was very simple and a great teacher for someone just picking up card reading. I am extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn really quickly
1452110581|5.0|Another book I bought for a gift and wished I had several copies to pass around to my cat loving friends.  My daughter started reading it the minute she got it and called me laughing so hard I could hardly understand her.  It is a most amusing book.  One to be read and re-read and re-rend and over and over...etc<br />Heartily recommend it just for fun.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed the story very much and it surprised me at several occasions. It keept me exited until the last page. The love story was a bit too good .
B004Y042N8|3.0|Its a very basic game graphically and audio wise. The game itself is ok, i was able to quickly get through the first 20 levels or so. Its a decent mind game if you like brain puzzles. Nothing fancy about it, it just does its job. I wouldnt mind getting some more levels or a sequel.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I never write a review - usually I just read others but this book was so good I couldn't help but post! Great read- currently my favorite book. The characters are just over the top enough from reality to make the interesting but still relatable that you fall in love with them! And the story is one that keeps you reading- I loved it and literally had my heart bounding to the end!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Love this movie and this music!  If music makes you joyful, you will enjoy Pitch Perfect.  This is also fun to exercise to!  Rock on :-)
B009HEJXFS|4.0|While a little predictable, this was an entertaining film with a great story line.  I enjoyed it even though I did not see the previous movies.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|downloaded the game 3 times and would not install or say an error on the kindled fire. whats wrong with this  i think i even paid for this app.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The is a dramatic remake of the Snow White story with elements for every viewer.  It was a good mix of action/adventure.
B008XG1X18|5.0|what can i say..it speaks for itself...awesome...millions of ideas...i love it, and so do my daughters, and many great points of interest even for husbands(gardening)
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Engaging and very interesting story line; however, it's a difficult to follow at times as it moves between past, present and future.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|so creative..so imaginative..so much fun. i luv that u get to draw the main character. it is a little hard.
B000G759LW|5.0|I bought this for a christmas gift but kept it myself (sorry sis) this cd is so good.  Her best one by far!
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I got this Canon BP511A 1390mAh Lithium Ion Battery Pack  because my old battery would not hold a charge. It has been like that for over a year. I'm very happy with this replacement battery. I just wish I did it soon.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|i loved the book it was  a wonderful  book and a  credit to john grisham<br />you are always in suspense
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The Brits have done it this time - what an intriguing series with fascinating characters. Beautiful costumes and scenery. Love to hate Thomas and O'Brien. Can't wait for more!
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|The fourth story of the \\"Underworld\\" saga is interesting and in my opinion, just as good as the previous films in their own steads. I personally was more interested in the stories than all the visual gores, actions, and the killings, and the story of \\"Awakening\\" is just as interesting because of Selene's search for Michael after being in a frozen sleep for many years and ended up finding a girl with the similar abilities as Michael's. Admittedly, I would like to have Michael (Scott Speedman) back as a returning character. The dynamic between Selene and Michael was phenomenal in the first two films.<br /><br />In all, it's a great action-horror film.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game was super addicting very fun, it poses some challenges as well so it's not just an easy kill your time kind of game
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I am a big fan of criminal minds and the story lines in this edition are great as always.  Can't wait to get Seventh season.
B001CDD84Y|5.0|Big fan of this movie and I watch a lot of movies! The theatrics of this movie and just the over all plot is entertaining! Been awhile since I watched it but look forward to seeing it again!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book didn't disappoint with a structure that kept pushing and pulling me in different directions.<br />An exquisite ending remark.
B005LAII1C|4.0|4 1/2 out of 5 stars<br />Ok I was hesitant on watching this movie but got it for free and after watching it I would gave gladly bought it that night. The movie starts off with a little kid and his Teddy bear...a wish was made. Now you get a contact buzz from watching the movie. I laughed a lot throughout this movie and urge anyone who doesn't mind drug use in movies and one boob shot to watch this movie when you get the chance!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Starts slow and easy; but is sneaky addictive.  Successful completion of the more advanced puzzles is both fun and gratifying.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a fun read. I loved it . I wish it didn't end where it did, I feel like it should go into the future. Other than that it was great it tugged at every emotion.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|...another Pendergast novel that is even better than its predecesors!  Such sad and unexpected twists and turns!  Is Diogenes dead...now I wonder about that too!  Preston/Child are genius!
0446554995|2.0|I look forward to reading the Pendergast novels each year. They've been good, ridiculous fun with some great characters. Alas, after \\"Two Graves,\\" I'm not certain I'll be waiting for the next one with as much anticipation. There's \\"over-the-top,\\" and then there's incoherent. \\"Two Graves\\" crosses that line. It can't make up its mind where its going, or what its doing. Halfway through, I found myself hoping that for once, Pendergast wouldn't escape, that the Nazis would finish him off, and that the series would be at an end.<br /><br />That's right. The authors made me root for the Nazis. Not a good omen.<br /><br />I fervently hope that this is a temporary detour from the usual quality, but I'll be looking at the next one with suspicion.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Play this game more than any other I have.  However, it continues to freeze up, especially after getting close to beating fastest time, also, shimmies and shakes.  I hope they fix these problems, before frustration sets in and I delete it!!
078322799X|3.0|The reviews were very good. Fox and Jackson--what's not to like? So, I took a chance.<br />It had it's moments. It wasn't bad, but, it wasn't as good as I anticipated. 3 1/2 stars because this movie is a little bit better than OK. I will post 3 stars.<br />For a good PETER JACKSON movie, I will recommend DEAD ALIVE. That movie is some MAJOR COMEDY/HORROR (VERY GRAPHIC FLESH EATING ZOMBIE MOVIE).
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I dare you not to have a Eureka moment in this book.  Tons of good, real world information.  You will learn about yourself, and you partner.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Solid book once again by Mr. Follet. I look forward to the next book that completes this story. A great story!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The cross fire series is my favorite. I can't hardly wait for entwined in you. I feel like I am living through Eva & Gideon`s story. I've read it twice so far waiting for book 3. Hurry up Sylvia, the suspense is killing me.
0452257743|5.0|I loved each story in this collection. By far, this is my favorite compilation of King's work (and I have a lot of his works).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this so much it is wonderful in every way I only wish that I could read this again and it feel like it's the first time
B007L96VCY|5.0|Did not purchase this album when it first came out.  So happy to get the CD, now.  Some of Paul's best work.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|One of the most unexpected and fun novelettes I've read, really. And it got me turned on to the Mistborn series, which is great. I'll be eagerly following mr. Sanderson in the future.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Everyone should read this book! I reminder on the importance of kindness. Adults and children alike; a definite must read!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All three books were awsome. Could not put the book down until i read all three of them. Movie was good too.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I loved the movie so I thought I'd give the book a shot.  I really like the characters in the book.  The movie was definitely better because of the music and visuals but I liked the book almost as much.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|I love the fact that you now have more space for more apps. And you don't have to delete anything.
B003UPPO2G|4.0|great concert, i would have given it a 5 star except for the middle of the concert they only sang about a minute of about 10 songs(which is understandible) they did over thirty songs, one of which was my favorite
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This story grabbed my soul like no other, smiles and tears were equally produced by this compelling tale of a little girl surviving one of the darkest periods of modern times. READ IT!
B000X107GI|5.0|arrived quickly and is very useful for items that use this kind of battery. having more than one is great since most items require two.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|A must-have for all John Mayer fans! He plays almost all of his best songs live, truly a great viewing experience
B003JVH7XU|5.0|This movie was full of action! I'm a huge boxing fan, so to have boxing and action in I e film, is awesome! Never a boring moment in the film.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I love this tv show so wanted to own the music that is featured on it.<br />This is a good selection and certainly lives up to my expectations.
0446571415|5.0|I'm a big David Baldacci fan and this was another good read.  These are great reads for sitting in doctor's offices and making the time fly.  It helps to read the books that deal with the Camel Club in order, but you don't need to.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great exciting book has a lot of action<br />Can not wait to read the rest of the series<br />I hope you like it
1481251880|5.0|This book is by far one of my favorite books in the entire worlds, right next to Beautiful Disaster (if you loved that book you'll love this). This book is gets you right when it starts, it brings so much emotion out of you. Whatever the characters are feeling you are right there with them. Throughout the book you will experience Romance, Anger, Hurt and Intensity in one book,  You wont ever want to put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone in their Teens - 25.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|On 90% of my purchased CDs in the past, any form of bonus tracks can typically be \\"hidden\\"... so I recommend anyone complaining, MAKE SURE before the laments roll in. Put in the CD and once the final track on the album is over, leave the stereo on or fast forward for a few minutes. Yes, minutes. With 30 Seconds to Mars \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" album, the hidden song(s) were about 7-10mins into the last track. SO (if it even uses fast forward past 30 seconds-1min at the end of a song - the tracks ARE there. Just hidden deep in there. Although, if you use iTunes or Windows Media Player and the tracks didn't just show up, then I guess whichever record label made this error, will hear it. But I think the tracks are on there. I'll find out once the album arrives in a few days.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Katey Sagal is outstanding in this series. Not good for our current National gun problem; however, given the script and actors, I couldn't wait to watch all the series.  Grandson got me hooked on SONS and now there are 5 us watching each week and are looking forward to new season.  Not hip on violence, little too grizzly for me, so I exit to another room when those scenes are happening.  This is a tense & emotional series but we remember it is acting.
B009MF56GC|5.0|I would say as good as the first one. Lots of action, a few different<br />characters. I didn't even realize the bad guy was Van Damme at first. Where has he been hiding.<br />Buy it, good stuff. Go geezers!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Simple design and very easy to use. And since I have it on no Kindle Fire, big size too. Good work!!!
B001TOD92C|5.0|I hunted for a long time to finally find this movie.<br />I like it because it is gritty, realistic and genuinely<br />makes you think what our athletes do to entertain us.<br />Sad movie, glad to see Mickey back.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The best series I have ever watched on TV.  Extremely well written, superb story  line,......a must for everyone who enjoys political thrillers.
B001F0N0ZG|5.0|I love this movie.  Even though I didn't watch the series, it was easy to watch.  A great love story with a perfect ending.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|This is a great product with and extraordinary artiste of course, not only was cd delivered in a timely manner but also the packaging was more than i expected, bubble wrapped to the fullest making sure the cd was in excellent condition when it  arrived. Awesome :)
030758836X|4.0|WOW, what a mind burn....I have never hated a character as much as Amy.....the ending is frightening, terrifying...I lost lots of sleep when I was done reading.  I couldn't wait for the end and I didn't want it to end....go figure!!!  I am still having nightmares.  I've told my friends to read it...BUT with caution.
0142800805|5.0|Even though used, all CDs were is there and in very good shape. Gave to friends for long drive to south Texas from northern Michigan.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Eva and Gideon are perfect for each other. I can't wait for book 3!! This book really puts so many things into perspective.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I am enjoying the game very much. there is a lot of going back and forth but if you pay attention you will find your way. this game is one I really feel I got my monies worth.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This book is a classic for a reason. Told from different perspectives it weaves a beautiful dark tale of horror. It is the standard bearer for all vampire stories. Everyone should read this book
B004Y042N8|4.0|Samsung galaxy SII works good, but the kudos prompts flash very fast. The puzzles don't stay simple for very many levels. The first few are commonly known, then the dev creates them, so it's challenging.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Syncs with my Kindle, can read from my Phone and when I go back to my Kindle pick up where i left off from my phone.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|Among Fagen's four album's, this one is so-so.  Some of the songs sound similar to ones he's recently recorded, both solo and with Steely Dan.  A couple of songs are good (e.g. I'm Not the Same Without You and Out of the Ghetto), the others mediocre/average.<br />Maybe Donald is running out of ideas for new songs.  He can still sing and play, but I think he needs to collaborate with another writer, whether it's Walter Becker or some other dude.
B009I2UH2W|3.0|Props to Griffin for the build quality.  The lightning plug fits perfectly in my phone and unlike some cheap versions can be flipped over and still plug.  If I'm not mistaken, this adapter puts out 15w so your phone charges FAST.  This is great b/c it makes the most of short car trips.  I'm often only in the car for 10 minutes at the time but b/c of the wattage I still get a good chunk of charge.<br /><br />The products tragic flaw is the short cable.  Seeing that it's coiled, I figured it would stretch to accommodate my needs accordingly.  Though it is stretchy, it requires a lot of force for the coils to spread.  I even tried leaving it stretched out on a table with 2 books holding it down overnight, for 2 nights, and to no avail.<br /><br />My car is pretty small, but the cable is so short i can't hold the phone in my hand where I can easily see the screen while keeping an eye on the road.  If I stretch it some, a lot of strain is put on the lightning plug and I'm concerned that overtime the port will be damaged.<br /><br />Edit: in fact, the cable is so short I can't even place the phone in my dashboard tray while it's plugged in.  The distance from underneath my center console to the dash tray (just in front of the transmission) isn't very far.<br /><br />If you're desperate for a lightning cable car charger, this product will do the job, but it doesn't do the job well.
B00000DP01|3.0|This is an early album by Genesis, and a far different sound than what came later in the seventies.<br />It's okay, but nothing really memorable.  I bought it because I was curious about what kinds of songs they recorded in those days.  Not surprised that this album flew under the radar back then.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really didn't enjoy reading this book but was very, very curious to see how it would end -- does this make it a good book?
B00A757EFW|4.0|pretty good app for this game....brings back good memories and easy to maneuver. if u like oldies but goodies this is for u
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Movie did not disappoint on laughter if you are in to crude and vulgar humor. I enjoyed the movie but would not recommend it for children just because there is a teddy bear on the advertisement.<br />Enjoy !
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you're a Stephen King fan you'll love this one!  It isn't his typical horror but there are traces of the same darkness.  This is one I will read, re-read, and read again!

0142419400|5.0|I was a little bit weirded out by the title at first. I read the reviews and decided to go for it. I will never, ever, regret buying this. I loved it with an intensity that I don't think its sane. Something that I'm not really sure where's coming from, made me fall in love with St. Clair. I only wish this book was real. If you're hesitant on reading this book, I promise you will never regret it. It's a combination of frustration, and love. I had the biggest and the greatest love/hate relationship with this. I think I loved it more. I just hated it because I realized none of it was true. Oh well, that's what books are made for.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very engaging!  The plot has many twists and turns keeping you guessing with every new revelation. Even the ending is a suprise.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|Not as good as the first season, but it's very Decent.  Love the leads of this season!  Jessica Lange is fantastic!
030758836X|5.0|Fasten your seatbelts folks b/c these people are completely out of their minds!  I have to hand it to Gillian Flynn b/c while the subject of this book is disturbing and horrific, she makes you laugh out loud and feel empathy at times for people with montrous behavior.  She keeps you quessing and asking.  Who is the bad guy?  Who should I be rooting for?  How should this end?  How should justice be served?  The ending is genius!  Just read it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This wasn't exactly what I had expected. It was so much more. What an amazingly written book. There are so many emotions you feel through out the story. There were moments that I smiled, got scared, laughed, and actually cried. Cried both tears of sadness and tears of joy.  I don't think I have ever let out such a deep sigh after I have finished such a book.<br />  Recommended completely for a more mature reader.
B000VSBX34|5.0|My mom and I are beatles fanatics!  When my mom was younger she taped Help! onto a VHS through a VCR recorder.  The quality was sub-par and the video was outdated.  Not to mention, we didn't have a working VCR in the house anymore.  So for Christmas I set out to find her a DVD copy of the movie so she and I could once again watch and enjoy the British Invasion.  I love this product and so does my mom. The quality is great and we have absolutely no complaints.

159420411X|5.0|Not only is this book well-researched, informative, etc, but it is very enjoyable.  The topics explored are interesting and are presented in a manner that is both informative and entertaining.  The chapter on the poker-playing computer was a real page-turner (just trust me on that one).

1408834820|4.0|About the Stories and My Opinion:<br />I recently received these books and they were great.  The content was what I expected and I was not disappointed.  However, be warned, the stories are indeed short, but true to the World of Harry Potter.  To get a better understanding of my personal point of view on this topic, I feel it is important to recognize that I, ironically, normally do not like to read fantasy books.  However, I have come to respect J. K. Rowling's writing style and admire her desire to donate some of her profits to various charities.  That being said, I, like many others, started off disliking the boy with the funny scar and his strange world the moment it hit the media, but I was without reason and factual causation.  At that time, I didn't read the books, nor watch the movie.  I had no reason or support for my judgement.  Later I had the comical bitter taste of eating my own words once my wife introduced me to the movies and the original book series (which she still lovingly reminds me about to this day).  When reading the original book series, I began wondering what the sub-stories were that had been mentioned multiple times throughout the books.  What was \\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard,\\" and what captivated Harry so much about \\"Quidditch Through The Ages\\" that he would rent it from the library and sneak it out of the castle just to have Professor Snape take it away in the first main book (The Sorcerer's Stone).  Okay, I might be considered a nerd now, but guess what, now my wife and I know the answers.  These book are... informative, maybe; entertaining for a quick read, definitely.  Please do not make the mistake of trying to parallel these books to the originals or you may be sadly disappointed.  They are rather sub-stories meant to answer the nerdy questions some of us randomly asked ourselves throughout the original series.  They are fun to read while dipping your mind into a better understanding of who the people of the Harry Potter world really are.  After reading these books, you can get a slightly better idea of how the characters in that literary constructed realm may think, what they are exposed to as the norm, and what ideals and books they might be introduced to growing up and in their society. Once again, I sound like a nerd, but these points are true for anyone wishing to dwell deeper in the the Harry Potter world.  I definitely recommend these books to all true Harry Potter fans.<br /><br />The Product:<br />The Outer Case is protective and well made in terms of today's book standards.  The hardcover books themselves truly capture the Harry Potter Hogwarts Library feel down to the illustrated \\"Property of Hogwarts Library\\" on the lower left corner of each book.  (Warning: depending on your point of view, spoilers might be included next).  The delight continues with the personalization of each book, including how \\"Quidditch Through The Ages\\" has a beginning page that lists prior Hogwart's readers and the dates they were checked out and how Harry's \\"Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them\\" has a funny student written conversation involving \\"Dungbombs\\" on the first pages.  Now if I only understood what a Dungbomb was...  In either case, the fact is that these books are well made and a great product to add to your Harry Potter book collection.<br /><br />This Particular Seller:<br />The only reason I gave this product a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating was because of the Seller.  Ironically, I received this same set of books as a gift merely hours after placing the order for them.  I tried to cancel the order once, and received an email notice from their company saying that they received the cancellation request and that it was being processed. Later I received a kind email from the company thanking me for my purchase and that they will be shipping the product soon.  As such, I sent another cancellation request.  Again I received an email stating they received the request and thanked me for my time.  Ironically, later I received another email, once again thanking me for my purchase and it will be shipping shortly.  After other failed attempts, I gave up.  Long story short, it shipped two full business days after I placed the order even though I canceled the order 2 hours after the order was placed.  I later found out that they apparently have communication issue between the order department and the shipping department.  Do not take this all as bad though.  They did offer a refund of the product's cost if I shipped the product back, but after recognizing that after paying shipping both ways, that product would be best to keep and donated to the local library for others to enjoy as my family did with my first set.  Amazon has been told of the companies issues in communication and made a note.  Sadly, I have read other issues with this same company which is a shame via the great products they have.  I have heard of orders not arriving in some posted comments, in my case, the shipping for this product did not come with any form of tracking and it took over a month to receive, so if you ordered or are thinking of ordering this product, it may require some patience on your part until the product arrives.  Once again, though I had issues with my cancellation request, the company was nothing but nice to me, they just presented with communication issues.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />These books are worth buying for any true Harry Potter fan, but watch out for this seller.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|As a fan of the musical from its beginning I have long awaited a film that would do it justice but unfortunately this is NOT that film. If Tom Hooper wanted to make his own version of Victor Hugo's classic novel then he should have hired his own script writers and made his own film instead of hijacking Boublil and Schonberg's work.<br /><br />While the film is visually beautiful, it completely lacks the power and passion that drives the musical. In his directorial choices in every instance Hooper emphasizes the visual over the music. Most of the wonderful ensemble pieces have been cut to the bone, eliminating much of the intensity and excitement that keeps the audience engaged through what is a long and complex story. I have seen a number of stage productions of \\"Les Mis\\" over the years, and it succeeds because all of the production elements work together to draw the audience into the music, literally pulling them forward onto the edge of their seats as they listen. The film had the opposite effect on me. I found myself, for the first time in almost 30 years, looking at my watch and wondering how much longer this agony would go on.<br /><br />Granted, film is primarily a visual medium. But a musical stands or falls on the quality of the music. All the other elements in a musical production are designed to support and showcase the music and the singers. It's clear that for Hooper the music is just background noise. His biggest mistake was the decision to go with so-called \\"live\\" singing. It might have worked if he had chosen actors with voices adequate to the demands of the score.<br /><br />Russell Crowe's Javert is like a zombie, his singing flat and expressionless. Anne Hathaway, in contrast, roils and writhes with despair as Fantine, but all that cracking, sobbing emotion is a poor substitute for real vocal power. Amanda Seyfried as the grown up Cosette is an insipid china doll with an insipid voice to match. The Thenardiers are neither menacing nor comic, and neither one can sing. Saddest of all is Jackman's performance as Jean Valjean. He makes a valiant effort, and if this had been a silent film, he would have deserved every accolade. He looks and acts the part, but every time he opens his mouth to sing the character self-destructs.<br /><br />It is a shame, because I have heard Jackman sing before. He has a fine baritone voice, but here he is trying to sing a difficult and demanding tenor part, and he simply cannot reach the notes. The results are painful to witness. His \\"Bring Him Home\\" is dreadful.<br /><br />There are two notable exceptions to this musical debacle: Samantha Barks as Eponine and Eddie Redmayne as Marius. Barks, a London theater actress making her screen debut, is riveting as the streetwise waif nursing a hopeless love for the student revolutionary Marius. Her \\"Only On My Own\\" has longing and poignancy in every beautiful note. Her duet with Redmayne, when Eponine dies in Marius' arms upon the barricade, leaves an ache in your throat and your heart. Redmayne's Marius is very fine; I would say second only to Michael Ball, the actor who originated the role. His \\"Empty Chairs and Empty Tables\\" is haunting and his voice has all the power and precision Jackman and Crowe lack.<br /><br />If you really want to experience this musical as it should be sung, I can only recommend you look for the 10th and 25th anniversary concerts on DVD, or the CDs of the original London or Broadway cast recordings, or the \\"Dream Cast\\" recording, or the 2010 cast recording of the new production; or better yet, take advantage of the opportunity to see the live stage production now on tour in the U.S. or save your money for the Broadway revival that is promised for 2014.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought the first book was good, but this kept me on the edge the whole time! Can't wait until I read the final book in the series.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|no case, was sent to me in a small cd envelope with only one side of the disc working. the directors cut. but not the other side. not at all what i expected

B003WMX3SY|5.0|the tower computer case wa a gift for a young adult who is determined to build his own computer -- and it was a hit. I confess not understanding the excitement but he couldn't be happier about it and his friends agree. that's the best recommendation I can give, and it definitely made me feel the purchase is worthwhile.
B00003CX5P|5.0|George Lucas intended the prequel trilogy to be about Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan.  But in many ways it turned out to be Palpatine's/Sidious's trilogy, a Sith Trilogy.  Darth Sidious was the Phantom Menace.<br /><br />At the beginning Sidous had the trade federation blockading his home-world - Naboo. Intending to use the suffering of the Naboo people to remove Valorum and get himself elected Chancelor.<br /><br />When Sidious learned Obi-Wan and his Master Qui-Gon intended to force an end to the blockade, he naturally ordered them killed.  Instead they escape and reach the planet, where they befriend a Gungan and eventually reached the Naboo capital.<br /><br />The Jedi rescued Amidala, and persuaded her to seek senate aid on Coruscant. Then they broke the blockade, and escaped into hyperspace.  The Federation needed Queen Amidala to sign a treaty, to legalize their invasion.<br /><br />Sidious, disappointed over the Trade Federations failure, sent his apprentice - Darth Maul - to track them, and to at last reveal the Sith to the Jedi and the Republic. Maul was eager to battle.<br /><br />It took Maul awhile to track Amidala and Qui-Gon to Tatooine.  In that time Qui-Gon found a human boy, Anakin Skywalker, in whom the force is stronger than any Jedi.  It was thanks to Anakin that they are able to repair their ship and return to Coruscant.  Maul found them as they were about to leave and nearly prevented their escape, but failed.<br /><br />When Amidala reached Coruscant, Sidious revised his plans. He realized that she could be convinced to call for a vote of none-confidence of Chancelor Valorum.  Then he could get himself, as Senator Palpatine, elected Chancelor.  His revised plan was successful.<br /><br />Afterwards Amidala returned to Naboo and convinced the Gungan army to assist her.  Sidious order the Trade Federation to wiped them out.  The result was a vast battle between the battle droids and the gungans.  Maul battled the Jedi. He killed Qui-Gon, and was then cut in half by Obi-Wan. Anakin guided by the force destroyed control ship for the droid army - he saved Naboo.<br /><br />At the end Palpatine was chancelor. He arrived on Naboo and greeted Obi-Wan and Anakin. As Sidious he was already coveting Anakin as his apprentice.  Willing to be patient,he didn't need to claim Anakin at that point. Sidious let's Obi-Wan teach Anakin about the force.  So when the time is right, all he would need to do is teach him the Dark-Side.
B004UIOUHC|1.0|Before you pay for it, make sure your device is supported. The download site said it was compatible, so I bought it. It would not download. After several emails, support said not all android 4.0 devices were supported and mine was one of the not supported. Faired okay, though, because I got  a refund.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|I really enjoyed this animated film. The characters were funny and original. They were also all designed well. Loved the &#34;weird girl's&#34; eyes and &#34;edgar e gore's&#34; long fingered hand and hunchback. the professor's face was great.<br /> I liked the little frankenstein references, but I also liked that it was its own story. and sparky was adorable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is amazing. The ending is fantastic and not what you expect. This book let's you experience so many emotions.
B00005JPS8|1.0|when 3 options are are in front of you, #1 blue ray , #2 standard edition ( which i already own from 2008) and #3 ULTIMATE EDITION WITH EXTENDED SCENES.  I bought this ultimate copy expecting the extended version. the description said disc #1 feature with extended disc # 2 extras. i have seen the extended edition on TV so i wanted to add it to my collection. Very disappointed!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a marvelous, realistic story of survival on Mars. No faster-than-light radios, aliens, or impossible orbital mechanics here. Just a clever botanist/engineer using his wits and materials on hand. The kind of story one might read (and love) in Astounding SF from the 1950s. I think the author is just a software guy, but he has done his research well and could pass for a NASA engineer.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Good idea, but kind of slow moving.  I don't understand why big &#34;prizes&#34; need to drop onto the coins randomly.  They also weigh a ton and therefore weigh the coins down so they don't move as fast.  It's ok, but gets boring fast.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I want to like this game but I am having trouble navigating it. I have not had time to call for help, but it is frustrating not to be able to get to the game myself.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it and wouldn't trade it for anything!  I could spend all day on Pinterest,  but must work a real job....
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book delivers all of the aspects that King fans expect. It's fast paced and graphic, referential, but thankfully for the reader, not self-referential.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Had it for a few weeks now......No problems....... good variety of stations..... I listen to Christmas year round..... plus old time radio horror and mystery shows.  Easy to use search function...... Keeps a list of my favorites.
B004CRR9G0|2.0|BLU-RAY review.  I am upset.  Disney has overstepped the line.  I love Miyazaki's films.  This one in particular is my favorite.  First off, I watch all of my Miyazaki films in Japanese with English subtitles. One of my favorite parts of all of his movies are the opening credits.  I don't care that I can't read them because they are in Japanese, they are all design masterpieces in my eyes. Between the drawings and the beautiful Japanese characters, they are a sight to behold.  Well, thanks to the arrogance of Disney, the credit sequence on this blu ray has been altered.  There are English names in a completely ridiculous font messing up the credit sequence.  It ruins the film for me.  I am going to try to import the Blu Ray from Japan, and hopefully Disney doesn't have a hand in that version.<br /><br />I would like to add that on The Castle in the Sky Disney blu ray, if you select Japanese audio, you get the Japanese credits, so someone had the right mind to fix that. Hopefully all of the future Disney / Miyazaki releases will have this correction.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book that is definitely a page turner. Looking forward to reading book three of the saga. Looking forward to the movies.
B007THA4FI|2.0|writing is good of course, but the whole story is not that interesting and took too long to get to important parts.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The movie was very funny.  The writing was witty and the characters were over the top hilarious.  The musical numbers are my guilty pleasure and the final sets were great.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My son & I LOVE this game! Its sooooo fun & addicting. We do not want to stop playing it.
B005LAII12|3.0|Love Mark Wahlberg and Ted  but I wrongly viewed the uncut version.  Movie was up  and down with humor.  Some parts very funny but funny trailers doesn't make a movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the best show ever! Keeps you on your toes the whole time. You will find yourself routing for some people and not for others. You will fall in love with this family.

B0085YNML2|5.0|My three year old discovered this game on her sister's kindle and loves it.  It is simple enough for her to play and yet enough fun for her thirteen year old sister too.  It doesn't hurt that the little lizard it so cute.

B0006AAS5G|3.0|The watch is very nice for a man. The only problem I have is that it comes in  BIG yellow box, not exactly the color I would choose for a man, but to each person their own, Invicta do me a favor- stay with black, or some more neutral coor for a man's watch please!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well, Downton Abbey has not failed to stat out the season with plenty of drama, both upstairs and down. My only complaint is not enough on Mr. Bates and Anna's saga yet but I am sure that is coming.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Just wanted people to know that this CD does have do you hear the people sing! Or, at least the version sang at the end with the whole cast as the film closes. It's in the track called epilogue, which you will notice is pretty long. It does miss out on some other highlight songs for sure, but they did a good job picking songs that flow well together and still get the story across, and still fits on one CD. I think this cast was fantastic and that they all performed really well! Including the oft criticized Russell Crow. He was great and brought a sentiment to Javert's character I'd never sympathized with before. Overall this is the most moving performance of Les Miserable that I've heard for me, the broadway ones have gotten more and more stale as the technical quality has gone up. These are more raw but to me very powerful, worth a listen or better yet a trip to the movie. Cheers.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|This charger is well worth the price. Charges the iPhone 5 very quickly. Highly recommend. (Honestly, I've never been disappointed in ANY Griffin product I've purchased - quality 100%)

B003YOEXUM|5.0|The last two albums that comprise the new and reinvigorated Accept don't pull any punches. In one word both albums are just GREAT! The songs are fantastic and the production clean but with punch. No loudness war artifacts here, just good and loud.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Just like that could clean the carrousel too. I wont review anyother app, too many words. like this app, ok?
B00138CUYM|5.0|What more needs to be said? It's Accept, it's a classic album...And it ROCKS!!!! Good times from beginning to end. I had the good fortune of seeing Accept on their most recent tour and they're better than ever. Although only a portion of the original line up they are reborn and rolling out a phenomenal energy packed show. So, pump the volume on this classic Accept album and go seem them the next time around. You won't regret it.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I gave this item as a gift to someone who really loves this show, he was thrilled with the gift.  The package arrived very quickly and easy instructions for return, should it not be the right item.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who loves a good series.

B00138KM1U|5.0|My favorite Accept album from that era. It's so raw, real, and genuine. No posers here...they just rocked and continue to rock.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|It's a solid piece of entertainment from Lois McMaster Bujold-- Perhaps not the strongest outing ever, but more than worth the ride.
B008Y1YJ90|4.0|We love the classics, but this year we thought we'd look for something a little newer to enjoy. Always wary of innuendo and dragging down Christmas, we thought this story was really adventurous and fun and the outlandish possibilities of highly trained elves - akin to high-level military operative training (sorry for the semi-spoiler) - was fun and so unbelievable that even the kids took it for what it we believe it was intended; an impossible ride through a visually interesting, fun, and funny movie that makes you feel like a winner at the end.
B008US4PBY|5.0|great device i love it. right now i can use ps3 controller on xbox to play online. i was expecting lag while using this device but there is none. it is really great
B001MTENOC|3.0|Was not what I thought it was. I was more interested in the time between lives. How long between, memory hold over after incarceration. Behavior that isn't normal for a baby or a small child. These questions were not answered or addressed in the book. Still interesting reading.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The characters came to life in this story!  It was like watching a movie in my mind with some scenes I would like to forget.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not the best in the series. Somewhat chaotic and disjointed, i felt. And the forced &#34;happy ending&#34; came off that way.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|This table gets mixed reviews, and reading them all sometimes makes me laugh. See, you have 3 different sets of users writing reviews for this table: The Audiophile on one end, the person who has no idea how a turntable works in the other, and everyone else (normal) in the middle.<br /><br />You will notice a lot of the so-called audiophiles rate this table poorly because they compare it to one that costs 4, 5, or 6 times more. These are the guys who will spend several hundred (or thousands) on a needle alone. Not sure what they expected buying a turn table at this price... Then you have the \\"hipsters\\" who do not know how a turntable works, what to expect, or even how to set it up. These hipsters only get a turntable because vinyl is trendy this week. You will notice a lot of these hipsters complaining about sound quality when they plug the turntable to a pair of tiny computer speakers, they complain no sound comes out yet they don't know the difference between line in and phono. Then you have everyone else, the normal person. Maybe they have a collection of records in the basement that would like to play again. Maybe they realized that vinyl never really went away and went back to it. Maybe they just want to start a collection.<br /><br />This turntable is great, not good for the price, not \\"ok,\\" but great. When connected to a proper receiver with a decent set of speakers the sound is full, rich, warm. Sound quality is mostly equal or better than a CD (or Mp3) and, occassionally, bad when you play a heavily abused and dirty record.<br /><br />I picked this table for its features and the lack of stuff I simply do not need. There is a nice looking audio technica turntable out there (model 120, I believe) that plays records backwards, I simply do not need to pay for features I do not need. Yes, it is built a lot better, and it will allow you to replace the cartridge. However, the built of this Sony turntable is decent and, since I am not going to take to the beach, I'm ok with it. No, you cannot replace the cartridge on this table, but I don't care. The cartridge that comes with the turntable does a great job for the normal person and you can still replace the stylus. Sony has used the same stylus assembly in their last few models so you can still find a replacement. If you can't find a Sony brand cartridge, the Audio Technica cartridge floating around here is the same thing (in fact, the audio technica model 60 is the same as this, just a different color.)<br /><br />The features this turntable has, which I NEED are:<br />- I can replace the stylus when worn out<br />- Automatic: I don't mind having to set the needle to play, but I like that when the record is over, the arm automatically goes back, unlike manual tables that, if you forget about them, will continue to spin and wear out your needle.<br />- Plays 33's and 45's. Unless you have a collection of 78's, you'll be fine.<br /><br />Also, I have noticed NO skip or skating. The speed is accurate, there is no hum, no need to ground, and you can use your own preamp if you are so inclined.<br /><br />Buy this turn table with confidence if you are going to use it as part of your home stereo system.<br /><br />If you are an audiophile, or if you think you are a DJ and want to do fancy tricks, then skip it. It's unfair to treat this thing as something it is not.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|Sure wish I had read the reviews before I wasted a couple of hours of my life watching this one.  It was a great idea gone undeveloped.  Good for the first 15 minutes or so, then it's all south from there.  Don't waste your time.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|I like it but need to learn better how to use it to get the full benefits of this product.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This app is challenging and fun.  The graphics are really cute and its kid-friendly game.  Good way to waste some time. Ready for the new levels to be available.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Does a good job of protecting the Kindle Fire but has no storage pockets which means the charging cord is left out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game more than anything....best game I ever played .... try this game I know you will like it.... =)
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I just loved this movie, it was better than I had hopped it would be. I cant wait to share it with friends .
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved reading this book in public and in secret, with the idea that nobody was knowing I was reading it.<br /><br />The sex is hot and the story is good, though Anastasia always has it easy. I read this book in a few days and became a Grey addict. I'm waiting to meet Christian...
B00785P2QC|4.0|I though this game was fun l. I love how much you can control. great game. I want all my friends to play. great.
B0015DROBO|5.0|A fantastic story with heart stopping drama. I felt like I was really in the story. Can't wait to see what happens in the next book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was hooked, right to the very end! Fantastic! Suzanne Collins has done it yet again. I am eagerly awaiting the third!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great story, after reading it I was suprised to find this was the same author as The Egg. Now I wait for more.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Collins and her heroine run out of gas.  The story simply is not deep enough, and Katniss's influence is not believable enough, to maintain the momentum from the first two tales.  Disappointing by comparison, I found this novel simply average.
0765325950|5.0|It is hard to say goodbye to friends we have grown with and in some ways I wish we didn't have to. I almost wish that we could continue to experience and follow the story of our beloved friends, but it isn't practical and it wouldn't be fair. This book summed up perfectly the series as a whole, and ended with a torrent of emotion unlike I have ever experienced in fantasy or other. This book and Brandon Sanderson did the world Robert Jordan created proud.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Child creates an immediacy from the opening page, confining the reader right alongside Reacher in one twist after another.  The side characters lack development, but a modest suspension of disbelief allows the reader to enjoy the ride.  The butt-kicking quotient was a little low until the finale, but the mental action was constant.

B00447L4KA|5.0|One of my favorite movies! Modern version of \\"The Taming of the Shrew.\\" Even better than the old Elizebeth Taylor one.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Not happy with the pay to play, but I like the way you can earn &#34;plus maximum regen&#34; for additional coins.  Some of the heavier items are very hard to get with your allotted amount of coins, and I'm too sensible to buy more with real $$.
0316010669|1.0|I'm surprised by all of the glowing reviews here. Unfortunately for me I suppose, this book was my introduction to Malcolm Gladwell. Wasn't impressed.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted already, the idea was good in theory, but apparently very difficult to approach in practice. There were far too many anecdotes (some of which dreadfully recounted the procedures of quantitative research... an absolute snore-fest), and to top it off, some of the points CONTRADICTED each other to the point where one just couldn't be sure what he was arguing for anymore. Judging from this book alone, Gladwell reminds me of one of those college professors that looks good on paper and in person, but doesn't say very much anything at all. That one obnoxious tenured professor who reads directly from PowerPoint slides and then expects her/his demonstration of lazy thinking to pass for good teaching.<br /><br />If you're the type of reader that recoils from the idea of using indirect--possibly irrelevant and tangential--anecdotes to make an argument, then you'll probably, at the very least, strongly dislike this little number  (**SPOILER: the example that immediately comes to mind--although I'm sure there are better ones--is when he talks about the quantitative data overload suffered by the Blue Team versus the ingenious invention of the valid and reliable heart condition survey administered in Cook County). As a side note--though no less critical a point--I also found problematic the fact that he doesn't even DESCRIBE or DEFINE in any considerable detail the nebulous and highly contested term, \\"unconscious.\\" He just sort of takes it for granted that we all have one and use it in the same way, and on a regular basis. Again, lazy thinking.<br /><br />I hate giving books lousy reviews because I know from personal experience how difficult drafting a book can be. However, I would be remiss if I didn't suggest to potential readers of this book (especially the ones that are thinking about making a purchase) that there is definitely better material out there (and for FREE, no less). Just run a key search on Google Scholar and you'll find a plethora of material on this subject and related issues that are more thoroughly parsed out  than the half-hearted attempt of this book. College graduates will probably know this fact all too well.a purchase) that there is definitely better material out there (and for FREE, no less).

B0091REZMW|2.0|Real frustrating that play needs to be supplanted by paying real $$ for increased enjoyment.  I like hidden pictures, but not hidden costs.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|This Kindle Fire Sleeeve looks great and works as expected.  Get One for yours!  It should work for you too!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Sometimes the tiles are difficult to determine if they are open for play or boxed in.  also, some are difficult to match because of design.  I just need to play it longer to know what tile matches what tile.
1401310672|5.0|Bought this for my sister for a present. Since she owns a cell phone store, I thought she would get a kick out of it. I started reading it before I gave it to her and didn't want to give it up. I absolutely laughed till I cried. Had to walk away from the book a couple of times because I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. Highly recommend especially for those diehard texters.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|The flippers are difficult to operate and they are not always responsive.  It is just the way a Kindle works, I guess.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Still cant get it to install! What a terrible download! Says easy, but unrecognizable to tablet w correct android os.. junk.. shoulda read reviews b4 ordering!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|If you are used to facebook on your computer, this mobile version is a bit tricky to use.  It is not as easy to use as the computer version.
0761169431|5.0|My nephew started but couldnt concentrate at the Christmas party with all the activities going on but he took it home and said he has had alot of fun folding paper and making wonder star war items<br />thanks
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works fine, and I like the way it keeps stats.  Very much what I expected in a basic solitaire game.  No problems.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awsome but could you please add night and mobs in creative.<br />Could you also add villigers and villiges and enderman.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Great movie that can be watched over and over again! It is a tad &#34;dark&#34; but that is what you get when you watch a Tim Burton film!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app I love it so much I haven't stop til now oh my gosh I could play forever my sister loves it two I recommend this app if you just like horses
B0018OIK0E|5.0|Easily finds a place in my top 20 movies, tons of laughs and jokes to be repeated amongst friends, fun to play drinking games with too :P
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Boring, stupid characters, nothing of interest in the entire length. About the only neat thing were the effects. Otherwise a huge waste of time. Nothing memorable, nothing ground breaking, not even an interesting story. If you wanted to watch this for violent entertainment you would be only slightly more entertained. I was bored so much that I started reading my wifes magazines on the table in front of me. The fact is they could have cast Steve-o and whoopie Goldberg, and the story would have worked. There was no reason for this to be a Dredd movie. It's like they took the opening sequence from Stallones movie, and stretched it out over a couple hours. Really dumb... really pathetic... movie makers must just rake in the cash from the idiot masses if this is what we have to accept.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Nice for waking up in the morning. No complaints at all. Excellent would recommend to others. Excellent alarm clock. Thank you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was a fast read, I went into it not knowing what it was about but it made me think and had some good twists.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Great first season if only you can get past the first episode. It is soooo slow. But once you get past it all the episodes keep you wanting more.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoying this game. IT is so colorful. I feel like I was in the game. I couldn't stop playing. I am waiting for part 2.
B00005UQ9F|3.0|I watched Session 9 last night on Netflix. Overall I think it's not bad but it's not the greatest either. The whole movie looks like it was filmed with a camcorder which I didn't like, it made it feel cheap and low budget, if they used a proper motion picture standard camera then it would have added quality. The acting was great, good actors and interesting characters. I'm not going to spoil the story but I will say that it's basic, it starts off slow and picks up towards the ending, the ending was good but a little bit confusing. There was only 1 soundtrack that played off and on during the whole movie, it was good and creepy, and I applaud the sound effects.<br /><br />I would recommend Session 9.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I read this book in two days - I could not put it down.  It was one of the best stories I have read in a very long time.  I was so impressed I recommended it to a friend who loves to read - she too read it in a couple of days and now is recommending it to her book club.  I cannot wait for the sequel to come out.
B0043URV5U|5.0|This is classic bob seger , I have always loved his music and this cd did'nt disappoint me, 26 tunes on 2 cd's.
B005DD7H50|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much. The action sequences are not over the top. I didn't know the premise so watched it because I had heard good things w/ no clue about the plot. It's not the kind of story I had seen before and it was well executed w/ dramatic tension, humor and a little bit of &#34;what's going to happen next?&#34; to keep the audience engaged. I recommend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched the first season on Netflix and got hooked. Unfortunately, the second season was not available. So I purchased the second season on Amazon to watch on my new Vizio Smart TV with Amazon app. Wow! Streaming was fast, great HD quality and now I'm ready to watch the current third season.  Now with the Amazon App, my family doesn't have to miss any of their favorite tv or movies.
B004Y042N8|2.0|I could not get the app to respond to my touch. I could get one light point to change floods but could not make any other progress on the game. sounded interesting, but didn't work.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is one way to keep in touch with people and freinds. and  family members that live far a way
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Moonrise Kingdom is a great movie. To be sure it's quirky, but overall a very pleasurable experience. A must see.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love everyone of his books and this just as great!! I could feel exactly what the characters were going through.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This can be very challenging, yet not frustrating. It's fun, I will be playing it more. can't wait to see the harder levels.
B004EPZ034|5.0|this is a funny movie. i recemend this if you like alvin and the chipmonks.it is also a good movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|if you want to be hook to a game..this is a great one!! I bated it when it was over it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is a must have! Great audio bibles.<br />Many verions.<br />And the reading plans are great!<br />Oh and I happen to know the author, He's a great guy too!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this app is so helpful. to anyone whose mind races aat night, I recommend this app! it helps me to sleep by focusing on the soothing sounds rather than the million things I'm doing the next day.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Timeless. In this digital format, I saw the colors more true to life than when I watched this as a kid! Sounds great in surround sound too!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Very addicting.  I start to play and forget about time.  I think anyone who has ever played will also become addicted and not want to stop playing.  Anyone can play, even my mother enjoys playing and she is 82.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|It's a great spinoff!!! Bought this for my son and I , we love both NCIS's and this first season is great.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Bad piggies is OK but it takes time to get used to it and it is a little frustrating when you don't fully understand what to do.  Once you adjust it is good.  I think the biggest thing is that when you are used to angry birds you feel that bad piggies will be the same only about the pigs.  If you like angry birds I think you will understand what I am talking about, that is if you have also played bad piggies.  I still play and I am getting better at it and adjusting to it, so I should say that it isn't all bad.  It is a whole different view but still fun,
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Modern family is the funniest show on TV!!! We started watching it a little late and wanted to see the earlier seasons. This show is great !!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy the challenge of trying to finish faster and make all the right matches as quickly as possible.  If I don't do well I start over and hope to get better.  Anyone can play this as long as they know what to do.  All the levels are challenging.  It is a great race against yourself to go faster and better.
1449410243|3.0|Gave two of these as gifts based on Amazon comments.  Neither recipient had anything to say about it.<br />Guess it was not funny to them.
B004HD61KE|4.0|If you've ever read James Rollins novels before, you've come to expect action, science, and intrigue meeting in the most peculiar ways. If this is your first JR novel buckle up--the suspense and well woven character stories make it hard to put this book down until you get to the end. It's not so much a \\"who-done-it\\" mystery thriller, it's a more plausibly written \\"what could possibly happen next\\" novel.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel to readers new to JR books and veteran readers.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FOR A KID MOVIE. IT HAD A BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR HINT AND WITCH CRAFT TO TURN A PARENT INTO A BEAR. I DID NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Fun game. Can be a lil time consuming..but fun to play ..especially when u sittn around doing nuthin. I like the new tasks you have to do that helps you get more money, gems and stars. The only thing i dont like about the game is some of the kewl items u want to buy costs alot of gems.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This was a good movie although it was not a tear jerker. There were a lot of plots and ins and outs and action galore.<br />The special effects were special and ongoing.
145210655X|4.0|I probably didn't do my due diligence on this. The comics in this book are funny and clever, but it's not to be mistaken for a story.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|If you love this concert, then how can you go wrong with this 1080p Blu-ray with high definition sound?<br /><br />(Honestly I haven't watched it. It was a present and they loved it.)
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I have seen quite a few movies, but I think this is one of my favorites! I'm sure many people have written thorough reviews of the plot. However, I must say that this story is phenomenal. I've never watched a more riveting tale - this one being about the outlawing of the slave trade in the United Kingdom.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I went into Brave with very high expectations, its hard not to think that Pixar will continuously produce brilliant film after brilliant film. I was sorely disappointed by Brave. The animation is gorgeous, yes- but the story telling is just not there. It feels uninspired and predictable and has none of that signature Pixar wit. In the end, its a good film- just not Pixar good.
B00846REIS|4.0|Wow Gideon and Eva really heated up my life. So need a fan and WET naps for this one. Great read!
B007712XAU|5.0|can't wait to watch it over and over. Great story to watch Wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is one of the most amazing books I have ever read in my entire life! Including the Hunger Games and Catching Fire.
B00AOOIIVA|4.0|I enjoyed this one from Tim Burton. While watching the thought that went through my mind is all he wants is his dog. This was a good story. I wouldn't syay it was an excellent movie, because it did get a little creepy (especially that strange blond hair classmate). But still, I found my self identifying with the lead character.
1593272200|5.0|I am completely happy with this book. It is a well laid out reference book with just the right amount of detail to understand how to get things done in Linux. I am a software engineer and not a Linux expert, so I want a reference book that makes it easy to find the information I need to get the job done.<br />The way this book is laid out gives me a new appreciation for Linux. After many years, this is the first review I've written - the reason is this book is so great for my needs that I just had to compliment it.<br />Why can't other technical books be written this well?<br />I highly recommend this book.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I got a Kndle &#60;keyboard&#62; for my birthday a few years back and have used it daily! I have over 1000 books on it, and some games. My previous cable was getting to the point that I had to move my Kindle around to get it to even charge. But this replacement is perfect. It charges my Kindle right up and I like the length of it - gives me the freedom to move around a little bit if I want to read while charging. My last charger has lasted for 4-5 yyears, so it;s definitely a good product. Only age made me replace it
0765325950|4.0|While it's true that the previous books in the series have often been too wordy, too detailed, and a little too convoluted at times, for the most part it's an outstanding series. I've spent the last few years coming to know this group of people and the dark one they fight, and it's been an emotional ride. It has literally made me laugh and cry as I've read or listened to them.<br /><br />With A Memory of Light it seems to me that it's all taken both too seriously and not seriously enough. The characters say trite things to one another, discount and correct each other, and some of the banter just isn't believable, especially in the first half of the book. Supposedly these kids have grown up and are capable, have fought and killed and reasoned things out. They are supposed to be brilliant, strong, and powerful, and yet they often come off as fools and half wits.<br /><br />I especially find Elaine and Egwene annoying. I don't find them believable, although that's often been the case in this series. Additionally, most of the surprises in the story are well advertised in advance. The saving grace, unsurprisingly, is Mat and his wife, Tuon, the Empress May She Live Forever. They are fun and Matt as always is irreverent but believable and extremely capable.<br /><br />There are a lot of mentions of previous minor characters but they play small or no real role in the book. The bulk of the story is on battle plans and battles, with lots of near deaths and last minute saves. It's all typical end of the world nonsense and the only thing that makes it work is the sheer weight of the previous books in the series. This is a world of substance, one that has strong lore and characters that you care about and want to know of their fate.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend Memory of Light to anyone who has read all of the previous books. This isn't the best in the series, not by a long shot, but it aptly concludes the series and definitely has you on the edge of your seat as you waitfor the horn to sound, the seals to break, and the dark one to be banished.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I just wish they had included a few more of the songs from the movie (like &#34;Can you hear the people sing?&#34; ....?)  I even am really liking &#34;Stars&#34; by Russell Crowe, which I at first didn't like.  :-)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm hooked on Downton Abbey.  It's fast paced, terrific writing and great acting.  It make you want to know more about this part of history.  Great entertainment and a nice change from the, sometimes trashy, reality shows that seem to dominate TV these days.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I hadn't seen this film before purchasing it, but I'm definitely glad I got it. My husband & I watched it the other night & we both agreed that it's probably one of the best movies we have seen in quite a while. Excellent story line & the actors are phenomenal. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story & good acting.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I'm stunned at how quickly the Black Keys produce new albums, and every single one is better than the last.<br /><br />Why are you reading this review? You should be buying the album right now.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I bought these headphones and I pair them with the fii0 e9. I really like these headphones. I really want to try the AKG q 701 and the sennheiser hd 600 to see how my headphones compare to the higher end headphones.
B00633W614|4.0|A good read....well written...fast paced... story line was somewhat trite...good for a beach read that is likely to please everyone.
0817439390|5.0|This book helped me to understand exposure when everything I had read before left me confused. His style is very easy to understand. A must read for the serious beginner. Yes I would recommend this book to all my friends.

B005HSL626|3.0|It was ok the couple of times I played it then I removed it from my kindle fire because I lose interest.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was fantastic. It has wonderful detail and the storyline was superb. I certainly recommend it! But be forewarned it's sad..
B009K0P10K|3.0|I love the show, however, when the movie is in progress it kept freezing up. when it did this, the only thing I could do was to unplug the Roku from the circuit and start all over. this happened three times in a row.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is fun to play and can be somewhat challenging.  This is a good sample of the games you can play.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app that I have seen. It has tremendous resources, that really break down the Scriptures in a easy to understand reading.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin Dozer is fun to try and collect the different rewards so you can continue to play.  My grand-kids love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I was put off by all the dates.  I regularly found myself going back to figure out where the hell I was at in her life line.  Its sad you miss so much of their (re)introduction to each other.  But once you know them, and you are in... you fall hard.  Its beautiful, thoughtful, and deep.  Makes you question the things you think you know.  And I agree with past commentary that Holder is truly delicious.  I want my own.  Lovely book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's great!  It's a puzzle that grows in complexity at each level.  The game has kept me entertained for hours.
B00913P6G0|5.0|looooove kendrick lamar and his work, good packaging, i listen to it everyday without skipping a song. . . .
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Typical charming Stephen King novel transports u back in time to try and stop Kennedy assasination. Old theme but great story..Different!
1451648537|5.0|How did a narcissistic, self-professed A-hole who didn't shower because he thought his strange vegan diet would make him smell like roses make it to CEO of what would become the biggest company in the world ever?<br /><br />Was it dumb luck? After all, very few people were planted in the middle of Silicon Valley right at the convergence of rapidly improving computing and an extremely talented population. He was friends with one of the smartest engineers around (Wozniak) and had a mechanically talented father.<br /><br />While Steve Jobs was certainly lucky, there were quite a few people who no doubt were in the same position as he was yet it was Jobs who changed the world--the others didn't. Why? It was because Jobs had a relentless, unapologetic drive to create greatness. As he claims in multiple quotes throughout the book, he didn't want to the wealthiest person in the world (like perhaps his frequent antagonist Bill Gates might have and succeeded); he didn't want to push out products that were just good; he wanted to create greatness.<br /><br />Sometimes it worked (the iMac, iPhone, Pixar's \\"Toy Story\\"), and other times it didn't (Next Computer, Mobile Me), but the one constant throughout Jobs's fascinating story is that drive to make something that would change the world.<br /><br />Isaacson does a great job of laying out the history of a one-of-a-kind personality--the good and the bad. Jobs (and most of the others quoted in this book) wasn't a poet or a particularly eloquent person--no telling if the LSD had anything to do with that--but he has an amazing story that embodies technology and society as a whole in the last 40 years. After all, his story might be the greatest thing he created. Thanks to Isaacson for conveying it to us.
B004JHY8A8|5.0|I chose this book simply on chance of perusal. The story line grabbed me and whilst it was a tragic and powerful read, I think if one can get by the heart rendering circumstances it is quite an eye opener and soul searching thoughts by the conclusion of the book. Whilst it uses fictitious people,the event surrounding the story is indeed of historical accuracy. Highly recommend this book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed it. Kinda short but was fun. The graphic were well done. I like that I can use hints if I'm stuck.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|It was an easy picture to watch, mainly for children, but it was well put together. As always the talent behind the muppets is excellent.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Sometimes when the expectation is too high, the satisfaction is not so great. I think that was what happen when I read this book. It is a good story but a little boring in the middle. It is a good book to read, if your expectations are not that high.
B0076DELIG|4.0|fast moving and well written. Enjoyable for a quick read. Although it doesn't make a major impact, he does a better job at the well-plotted detective fiction, than anyone else around.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love just about every song on this album and have been unable to get the songs out of my head (lol).  Thank you Adele for rocking it out and singing your heart out in such a beautiful way.  God bless! :0)
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Just more of the same. Bad role model for young women, giving her life up for a totally unhealthy relationship.
B0056CUZRA|4.0|I liked this whole story- informative and kept me going the whole way as the way is long!! Interesting to learn more about long ago times and the reasons for various countries entering WW!
B003F3FJQO|4.0|The second installment was just as perplexing as the first. It's been a fun and easy read. I enjoyed it!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I will be the first to say that this is not my regular music genre.  I normally listen to harder rock.  I actually purchased this CD as I had met these guys in person in Scottsdale, AZ in 2011.  They really impressed me with their live show, and were very down-to-earth guys.  I bought this album, more out of respect for the band, than for the music itself.  I was blown away when i heard it.  I have probably listened to it at least 15-20 times since I have purchased it.  It has elements of rock, electronica, pop, and is just overall creative.  The writing and production of this album is very good, and the album flows start to finish very well.  It's easy to get wrapped up in it.  Great album, one for the collection for sure.  And you'll be supporting some great musicians and guys in the process.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought the structure, plot, and characters were original and interesting.  I thought the main character acted &#34;out of character&#34; at times (not referring to the twist), which made the story a little unbelievable, but in all I liked it.  I didn't find the ending unsatisfying, as some others did.  I think it set up a sequel and I'm eager to read it when it comes out.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Loved it loved it loved it loved it loved it loved it loved it, but hate to idea that I have to write something and just not give it the amount of stars.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Beautiful descriptions, riveting plot, fascinating characters, and philosophy all blended into a great novel.  I would definitely recommend this classic.
B007N8RULO|2.0|This may be just my own feeling but I like the game of Spider that I am already using a lot better. This one seems to work ok but I think the cards are quite a bit smaller than I'm used to (I'm a senior so I like 'bigger' better). It's just a comfort thing but I play a game to relax so, to me, comfort matters.
B0041KW076|5.0|The newly reissued Beatles for Sales not only sounds incredible on vinyl, but it includes a rare gatefold cover with photos of the band on the inside (American record buyers never had this before).  Definitely worth getting!
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I like all the R.E. movies but this one although still watchable is probably the worst one. I wish Ali larter was in it.
B001239NDO|5.0|All the music from harry potter is amazing. John Williams is a great composer. this music has alot of good memories in it for me. and this is good for listening to while doing math because every other song isnt a creepy or sad song,very nice. the christmas song is probably actually the creepiest song on here, which i found funny.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book held validity for me as a healthcare provider and a person who believes in heaven.  I had hoped he would delve into more detail.  It was a very interesting read--couldn't put it down.  I would recommend it to people who are interested in this subject, and would like to hear a scientist's viewpoint.
B00005MP58|5.0|All my purchases I am very happy with. I have enjoyed every one of my purchases. Great prices. This is the best movie of all Pride & Prejudice movies.
B007REV4YI|3.0|OK, Like I said why would he? She had him shot (accidentally) then when she discovers he's alive, then she acts like she could care less and says \\"By the way, we had your apartment and belongs sold\\" nonchalantly . What? Come on, please act a little bit surprised when someone you thought dead was actually alive, and Oh, by your hand non-the-less. This has nothing to do acting, Judi Dench did what she could with what she was given, the plot is gaping in this film, its not very good. Think about it, James Bond is a harden veteran spy who killed many people in her Majesty's secret service, why would he feel empathy for this person? M has done nothing really favorable, all she done is be a s***ty boss. Certainly he has killed for less than what M has done, I'm not saying that Daniel Craig's character should have killed M, but why would his eyes swell up and feel grief when she dies? In Casino Royale or maybe it was Quantum of Solace, he takes a friend after he gets killed and throws his corpse into garbage container because he needs to buy time in escaping (a friend that Bond has known for years) there is a reason why he does this, he needs time to escape his pursuers. In Skyfall there shouldn't be a reason for Bond to feel anything for M, its out of character, Bond is a cold and calculating person, James Bond is person who thinks fast on his feet, of high intellect. In Casino Royale, one could understand the grief he had for Vesper and what lead to the reasons to what he did in Quantum of Solace, There should be no emotion felt for M, why would he, she's not a likable person, I don't like her, fans don't like her, why would Bond? I would have thrown that worthless gift she gave him in the trash at the end of the movie. Skyfall is a hit and miss, in a believable world of James Bond he would care nothing for Judi Dench's character in Skyfall, in Casino and Quantum I thought she was just OK, nothing special and I loved these two movies. This movie's not a complete bomb, it's just merely OK. In my opinion I think Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever. Casino was a complicate film that worked, Skyfall is a overly done film that doesn't work, even Javier Bardem character Silva, to me, is forgettable, he's got the intellect to take an island city, why is it so complicated for this villain to find out where M lives and simple pay her a visit? Why rush into a Congressional Hearing an try to assassinate her in front of God and Country? Parliament (or what ever this building is) is heavy protected I would think. Nobody would be that stupid, chances of being caught are high, and what flunky would follow him, not professional ex military, idiots, yes, but a villain like Silva is not going to surround himself with dummies. I'm just saying a lot of this movie doesn't make since to me. One more thing, this movie could have used more semi nudity from the female actors (not Dench) and less semi nudity from Craig. Pierce Brosnan should have stared in this movie.
B000002OG5|5.0|We have this on a 33 inch LP. We wanted a CD to replace our copy. We enjoy listening to The Godfather.
B005LAII80|5.0|I think this movie wasn't marketed well enough, I can't really say for the USA, I live Europe I didn't see any Advertising here, This is in my opinion why this movie flopped at the box office. I thought this film was better than Looper, Total Recall and The Bourne Legacy, I will go as far as saying it was better than Skyfall, much better. I watched this movie 3 times and I really loved it. I think it was spot-on what Dredd is like, I have some comics on him and I think they nailed it. People are complaining about the story line, what do they want, Cloud Atlas? Confusing plot? To much going on at the same time? No! you keep it somewhat simple, with twists here and there, like with the lock-down/Vulcan Cannon scene on level 76. Look at the Avenger movie, people knew who the bad guy was thru out the movie and they knew what was going to happen, did anybody actually believe Loki would win? No, we just didn't know how he was going to lose. Same with The Dark Knight rising, Keeping things simple and basic added with an element of surprise/shock/suspense, this works well when its done right, I love these last two films I just mentioned. It irks me when people give a good movie 1 star just because the 3D on the Blueray doesn't work right or to some effect pertaining to the disk rather the movie it self, two words \\"return it\\" Another thing, one reviewer said he watched 5 minutes 25 seconds, then fell asleep only to awake at the end of the movie and then he gives it 3 star because he thought it was boring. This guy didn't even watch half of the movie. If you don't like this film and its not your cup of tea, I understand, but, please, be insightful as to why when you write an review, some people might not like the extreme blood and gore, which is understandable, but don't be idiotic and childish when writing about a movie you don't like. Anyways, excuse the rant, The score/music for Dredd is just purely awesome. I hope the Blueray and DVDs make up for the loss and they make asequel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, real page turner. The government overthrow and hunger games can stretch to fit real life. It's very powerful.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I thought this was a great read.  This writer has the gift to take the reader along for the ride.  I truly feel like I traveled with her.  It was so interesting how she told her personal story along the way.  This is a must read for anyone who likes the outdoors and can identify with making mistakes in life and being able to find a new path.<br />After I finished, I wanted to pick it up and read it again.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Absolutely love using it and do so every time I play golf.  It is very helpful in deciding what club to use for my next shot.
0446677450|5.0|I had borrowed this book from a friend because it was recommended as a great read. I started reading it and I just had to get my own copy. I recommend this read to all parents.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really love this show. I never heard of it before till a friend mentioned it so I decided to look at one episode. well now I'm hooked. very well done.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|NCIS is my favorite show, I watch them over & over again. The team works wonderfully together, & don't take any guff from anyone, I love Mark Harmon, & just luv ABBY.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Bad script, but who cares. Channing Tatum bares all. Oliva munn shows way  more than needed. They could have left her out.  The dancing is great. If they didn't talk, it would be a great movie
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent Book . very easy read and holds your interest. would recommend it for anyone who likes adventure and science fiction
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game with a few twists.  Don't use the hints unless you really have to though. You can earn awards for playing without help or skipping games.
B00785P2QC|2.0|Game too slow on Kindle Fire<br />I couldn't get the game to run well and I don't run many apps in the background.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I'm not one to watch tv shows on a regular basis, but this one has me hooked! One of the best series I've had the pleasure of viewing.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Aside from popular belief that this movie was bad and the story line was bad, I believed it was wonderful. I grew up with my english dad always saying the James Bond movies were awesome and were timeless movies that could be made for many years to come. After watching some of the movies, of course i fell in love both character and storyline of the entire movie production of James Bond. This movie was well made and Daniel Criag was great, as always, as acting as 007 again. So all of you haters of this movie and James Bond, you can all shut your mouths and keep your mean opinions to yourselves!
0307352145|5.0|A friend suggested the book Susan Cain's Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking to me and so I was glad to request it for review. My excitement is self-disclosure of being an introvert. It is not a badge I wear, but being around me for any amount of time would quickly reveal this aspect of my personality.<br />I appreciate three things about this book (more, but for the purpose of this review, I'm limiting it to three):<br />1) Cain does not just talk about introversion, but provides practical tips. For example, she talks about working with introverts and parenting introverts. Both of these sections seem down to earth and very helpful, both for those who are introverts and those who are less than introverts. I do wonder if those who with more extroverted tendencies will read the book, as these sections may be most helpful. The book likely is read by introverts, and the value of these sections may be lost.<br />2) I appreciate the encouragement to pursue silence and solitude. In an increasingly loud and media filled world it is often difficult to find moments of silence. Even in my rural home I cannot go outside without hearing a distant neighbor's air conditioner or dryer running or plane flying over. Noise seems to be the addiction of our culture. Though our modern conveniences add much to life, they can distract one from the importance of slowing down and simply being still.<br />3) Cain is not fatalistic. As a therapist I am constantly on guard of the tendency to label people. It is wise and helpful to identify personality types and important to categorize disorders for the purpose of treatment and understanding. However, the tendency is to use these labels as pejorative. I cringe any time I hear anyone talk of people by their personality type of \\"disorder.\\"<br />While reading the book I heard a sermon by John Piper on Hebrews 11: 39-12:2 titled \\"Running with the Witnesses.\\" His comments below articulate this point well. He says:<br />One of the criticisms I have of some forms of Psychology (not all) is the tendency to neutralize texts like this by labeling people with personality types that have no value judgments attached. For example, if a person tends to be passive you give them one label, and if they tend to be aggressive, you give them another label. No type is better than another type. Then along comes a text like this which says that passivity and coasting and drifting are mortally dangerous. The race might not be finished if we don't become vigilant and lay aside not only sins, but also weights and hindrances. If we are not careful, we can be so psychologically fatalistic that we read over a text like this and say, \\"O that's not for me, that's for Type A people, or INTJ's.\\" That would be a tragic mistake.<br />I know that there are personality differences, some more passive and some more aggressive. Each has its weaknesses and strengths. The passive people are in danger of coasting and neglecting and drifting and the many enslavement's that result. The aggressive people are in danger of impatience and self-reliance and judgmental-ism. And there are strengths: the passive people are less prone to murmur and complain and retaliate. And the aggressive people are more given to bring about needed change.\\"<br />We would do well to avoid the trap of fatalism, as Cain does here.
B000654Z2I|5.0|Perfect transfer from the analogue source to this SACD. Great stereo mix, a real good pleasure for Can lovers. If you can find it, just buy it !
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I don't know about the author background, but he must be an engineer! Sometimes he gives too much technical details, but the book is surprisingly catchy even though. Rithm can be a little bit plain.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Celtic Woman produces the most fantastic music. I am a lover of Celtic music as I often visit Gothic and fantasy markets where celtic bands are always playing. This is however the loveliest music I ever heard. The instrumentation is fantastic and the voices are not from this world but from heaven.
0765356147|5.0|The third book of the Mistborn trilogy brings this story to an end. This book was as good as the first two. If you are reading this review, I am guessing that you haven't started the series yet and are reading this review to see if it is worth starting. It's definitely worth starting and reading the whole way through. If you have read the first two books, keep going. Again, it is worth it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I am looking forward to a trilogy of these movies.  All the main characters worked well together.  This movie flies by when watching it.  The action and actingare amazing.<br />\\"Puny God\\"
0765356139|5.0|The second book of the Mistborn Trilogy carries on the action and characters that made the first book so great. If you liked the first book then definitely go on. It is worth it.
B001IYVUEW|5.0|It's about time they got a DC comic right.  These movies are how I always pictured Batman, dark and with insane criinals.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Cliffhanger.  Wish there would have been more explanations as to what happened in the capitol at the end of the war.
B009LRE040|5.0|It's about time they got a DC comic right.  These movies are how I always pictured Batman, dark and with insane criminals.  I am sorru to see the movies come to an end.
1609611543|5.0|I find this book very informative. Have tried some of the substitutions and my daughter has started loosing weight. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about a gluten-free diet.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead and Arrow are the only new TV shows in they last 4 years that I have loved and look forward to watching each week.  The zombies and dynamic in the group are great.  The gov. is a great mew character.  I look forward to the rest of the season!
B0058VW36U|5.0|My grandkids love it so it must be pretty good. I have played a couple times and did find it entertaining.
B001I189MQ|5.0|It's about time they got a DC comic right.  These movies are how I always pictured Batman, dark and with insane criinals.  The Joker was perfect! It is a shame the actor killed himself.  I would have loved more movies with Joker and Batman.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching fire leaves u wanting more! Can't wait to read the next one and find out what happens to them all!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I can throw away all those men's health/fitness magazines! No nonsense advice about the principles of getting bigger, leaner and stronger, including why you're doing what he advises you to do, diet advice, and simple sets of exercises that anyone can learn to do.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Fantastic book. Deeply appreciate all the stories and information provided by the author and his sources. I would love to recommend this book to anybody.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|I did rate it 4 star then I changed it to 3.  The reason being is that it is so dark.  I had to change my tv settings to make the color vivid.  Otherwise I like the book and enjoyed the movie even though the movie did all match up with the book.  But what do you expect most movies are like that.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|Cheryl's story really resonated with me. Though I have not suffered the loss of a mother but the feeling of emptiness and just wanting to get away from it all is what drove me to China for a month. I laughed with her and cried with her throughout the story.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anybody who has felt the same but also to anybody wanting to get out of their comfort zone.
B005LAII6C|4.0|This movie is funny and it is great in 3D.  I saw it in the theater and couldn't wait to get it for watching it in the comfort of my home.
1567184855|5.0|Whether you believe it or not, its a great read.  After reading, I opened up to some family about it and actually was told some personal stories about a couple children in our family who (at a very young age) spoke about a past life.  This book helped me to not be so close minded even though some of it is tough to chew, none of us can claim we know everything.  Enjoy as fact or fiction, but recommend to sit back, relax, open up and enjoy.
141659521X|5.0|This was a fantastic book, and had me reading it at the edge of my seat for hours.  I could not put it down!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I like the journaling. I like that it is interactive with this in the profile. I use this for motivation and recording music I am writing.
B005HSL626|4.0|pretty good game for free i reccomend you download and decide if you like it yourself because everyone has a different type or style of game that they prefer. so yeah check it out
0765325950|5.0|All your questions will be answered when you do.  Loved it as much or more as the rest of the series.
B000SEI230|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. It was a little different from the movie, but it was still good. Love Nicholas Sparks!
1465001107|5.0|Love it, Love Michael, it's a great calendar.  Very nice pictures.  I wish they had calendars every year when he was alive. I still have mine from 1988 though =).
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice app to waste time with. Only downside is that it doesn't accurately keep statistics. I'm pretty sure i've won more games than it says I have.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|A reviewer pointed out that 9 Mb was simply too much for a simple calculator. Though the app has added a few features, it has now plumped up to 13.4 Mb.<br /><br />It is a nice looking, but too bloated app. If storage space is an issue, avoid it.  If not, then I would recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The movie does not do this book justice. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series. Thank you Suzanne Collins for sharing your talents with the world.
B000BNX3AU|5.0|I received this movie on time and in good condition . Its a good movie and very intertaining film I would recomend the movie .
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Seth McFarland is a funny writer so the movie had a lot of good, smart one liners.  Not Mark Wahlberg's best acting.  For a story line with a talking bear it was a decent movie.
1439196834|5.0|I restate: How could you go wrong with Barney? A perfect gift for HIMYM fans, super funny. My only con about this is that &#34;The Robin&#34; play is not included, as this was published before that was written in the show.
0061148512|4.0|good book came in and i cant wait to read it. Dang i still have 5 words left. Benedict Cumberbatch.
143911000X|5.0|A terrific gift for HIMYM fans. A outragously funny Barney Stinson collectible that actually does teach you the great wonders of the Bro Code. Highly reccomended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Ads are unobtrusive and easy to skip. Game works well and offers hints when you need them. Damn thing is addicting! Great way to engage your brain in problem-solving and pass time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very suspenseful and action packed one of if not the best book I've ever read I suggest you read it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before  I read this. The book is much more descriptive. Although written slightly strange, I found myself rereading over paragraphs several times to understand. Maybe that's just me or the interruptions at the time.. excellent book by all accounts. Tomorrow I start on book two of the trilogy! I can't wait!
030726999X|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  I was so disappointed when I got to the end of the third book because I felt as though the characters were my friends and I didn't want to lose them.  Grab a seat, buckle yourself in, and enjoy the ride!
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|My girlfriend and I both enjoyed this movie.  I can't even begin to claim it is the best movie of all time, but it certainly is worth the hour and a half you would have otherwise spent bored watching re-runs
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This is just a great series! The storyline and characters are rich and meaningful without all the usual violence, negativity, and deceit that television seems to be so full of these days.  Refreshing and entertaining.
B00AYB20KI|3.0|It was an interesting movie, had a decent twist but just was something I was expecting to happen. I didn't hate it but it wasn't a 5 star movie.
B009CPES4I|4.0|This is just pure entertainment.  Refreshing movie with a great cast that gives a real look at the challenges of aging.  Enjoyed it a lot.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is great and I can't wait for the next one to come out!!!! So good and couldn't put it down
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just could not put it down once I read first one.  Ready to start the third one in the trilogy.
067144901X|5.0|Our 18 mo daughter loves animals and she loves this book.  She enjoys learning the sounds each animal makes and this book makes it even more fun!
0792844890|5.0|Great classic movie.  It is really funny.  Our kids age 9 and 10 love this movie.  It is rated PG however it is the old rating system if done today it would be PG-13 due to bad language and some inaproprate stuff.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was just waiting for the 2 parter.  I decided I may as wel lget the whole set.  Part two was the best
1419705849|5.0|I bought one to donate to the library at school and my son was so disappointed that he didn't get one so I bought him one for Christmas.  My son has a hard time enjoying books.  But Diary of a Wimpy kid.  He loves it.  He read it in two weeks and my daughter who loves reading read it in one weekend.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|It was a gift and one well aprpreciated however I was privy to watching it as well and truly enjoyed it
1608871088|5.0|This was worth every penny and more. With sections on each character, the designs, insider information, and even a pull-out poster on the making of a scene, it's really something out of the fantasy world in itself! An absolute must-have for any art enthusiast, any fan of the movie or of Joyce's wonderful book series, or even a fan of just one of the characters. Extremely well-written and worth it even just for the preface written by Joyce himself. I have to have read it thoroughly at least three times already, and it never gets old!!

B00AESN8XY|4.0|Plague Inc is a game where you seek to eliminate the human race via a number of pathogenic species. Doing so by acquiring various symptoms and  transmission vectors to help further your cause. Simple enough to play but complex to consistently win. I give it four stars because I believe there's a certain amount of the interface which could have been done a little better so that I was not constantly bombarded by little pop-ups every 15 seconds or so. Overall a worthwhile purchase.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|\\"For Amy! Because she loves you!\\"<br />\\"Little Dorrit\\" is the type of series, that when it is all over, you sit there thinking (in a daze), \\"Okay, now what should I do?\\" Truly, you think about it for a long while afterwards. Then you go to find more like it, knowing all the while that its a gem.<br /><br />I've never read, \\"Little Dorrit,\\" so I'm not one to say how closely this follows the original story line, though I've heard that it keeps pretty close to the ideas in the novel. (It's got 7.5 hours to do it too...)<br /><br />The acting was superb- I can't remember when I've seen better. The scenery was very detailed, and the costumes were very believable. Every last detail in the plot was intricately planned out to give you the feeling of being there with the Dorrits and the Meagles and the Clennams. And the murderer.<br /><br />Tom Courtenay stood out as an excellent actor. Though I hated the way his character changed to one of pride for half of the series, that was his job as an actor, and he did it well.<br />Matthew Macfayden couldn't have done better. Those who loved him in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" won't be disappointed, though it's a strange to see him smile so much as opposed to his role as Mr Darcy. (But that's a good thing.) And as a matter of fact, if you didn't like him as Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, try him as Arthur Clennam. The difference is astounding.<br />Claire Foy fit the role of \\"Little\\" Amy Dorrit perfectly. She made it all believable, pulling the strands of each character to the center of the story. The performances of the other actors were certainly great work and with time and space, each could be given a whole review on their own.<br /><br />Pros: Great acting by all the characters (love them or not)<br />Lovely soundtrack. (Really, the music stands out. Unfortunately, there's no soundtrack CD or MP3)<br />Very memorable quotes. (For a person who loves quotes, that's fantastic.)<br />The movie has a good deal of heartbreaking scenes, anda good deal of hilarious ones as well.<br />When you see Flora Finching, get ready to laugh.<br /><br />Cons: Some amount of swearing though not an extremely excessive amount.<br />Hints of a questionable character in the obscure Miss Wade. Her role is unlikable to say the least. It plays a very small part in the story, and I still haven't quite gotten why she was necessary to the plot. She lures a girl away from her family to her home. Her purpose in doing this wasn't quite clear, and much is left to the imagination.<br />A couple of graphic scenes, one involving a murder, the other involving suicide. The latter is more graphic than the first, and might bother younger children especially.<br />Rigaud (the murderer) plays the part of a french villan,  and at times gets too free with women. This is limited to kissing for the most part in the second episode; after that, he goes around charming (or trying to charm) every female in his path. He was too much of a womanizer for my liking.<br /><br />Though I was happy for Amy and Arthur, I really felt bad for John Chivery. He was an unforgettable character, broken-hearted over young Amy, yet loyal forever, and in his words, (he was fond of composing his own epitaph.) \\"Here lie the mortal remains of John Chivery, Assistant Turnkey and later Chief Turnkey of the Marshalsea Prison for Debt. He was unlucky in love and endured a good deal of sorrow, but he rose above it and performed many an act of kindness, even to his rival. And always engraved, on stone, deep into his very heart, is the name of \\"Amy Dorrit\\".<br /><br />From the humor of the Circumlocution Office and Mrs. F's Aunt to the heartbreaking lines of John Chivery, to the smile that will be on your face at the end of the movie, it makes for a truly unforgettable experience. Sometimes you'll cry, sometimes you will be laughing.<br />In short, \\"Little Dorrit\\" is a movie I'm not likely to forget. I'll be keeping it for a long while.<br /><br />Hats off to the BBC.<br />Once again, they've produced a classic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket is a very awesome game to play.the problem is on the server you lag so bad . But anyway it is the best
B005S9EJ14|5.0|What a marvelous film! Hilarious, heartbreaking and idiosyncratic by turns. Just when you're afraid it is going to get too something, it spins in another direction. No one needs me to applaud the performances of all these fabulous British actors of high reputation. Maggie Smith - brutal and riotous in a wheelchair. Judi Dench being a little ditsy - James Bond wouldn't recognize her. Fans of Underworld [[ASIN:B000O14VAU Underworld]]will not recognize Bill Nighy (Viktor) unless they've been a fan of his in British mysteries, etc. What can I say about Tom Wilkinson. I was recently watching him again in Batman Begins [[ASIN:B000AU9UYM Batman Begins (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition)]]. Talk about a different performance.<br /><br />I'd like to put in a good word for the Indian actors in the subplot. Dev Patel, Tena Desea, Lilete Dubey & Seema Azmi (as the maid) are all compelling in their performances, considering how little screen time they actually receive.<br /><br />A totally delightful movie with every emotion you could want and a few surprises just for fun.
B003MC5N28|4.0|A nice quick read about making choices regarding the quality of life lived verses living a life of promised security.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME, WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN STAR WARS WOULD BE INCLUDED IN ANGRY BIRDS.<br />THIS WILL ALLOW OTHERS TO GET INVOLVED
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book and also this whole entire series have been wondering!!!! I can't believe that I've finished all of this series!! While reading Mockingjay I almost cried I started to tear up I can't wait for the movies!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was prepared to read this book, knowing that it was aimed at a young audience. I was pleasantly surprised to find it very well written, and didn't seem like a teeny bopper book at all. I was only disappointed when the book ended!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watching Downton Abbey on Sunday night is not enough! I really enjoy being able to see it again (and again.)<br /><br />The series is well-written, with wonderful actors and a very interesting portrayal of the historical context in which it's set.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|l love it! great way to pass the time. if you like hidden object style games it's definitely worth it.
B0077PBPJ6|5.0|You can never go wrong with a Masterpiece Classic movie and this one is no exception.  It is very poignant and well acted.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|The story line was okay. Characters okay.  We loved the Scottish accents though.  But I hold Disney movies to a higher standard.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Extremely well-written, funny and poignant.  Takes a look at teens dealing with cancer and relationships.  Loved all of the characters, especially the male and female protagonists.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Gosling is great for the role. Soundtrack is amazing. Doesn't get too caught up in story, but does what it does well.<br /><br />Showed up on time, works as promised.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book should be required reading for middle school age children.  It is extremely well-written and it sends an important message about compassion and tolerance.
1442454105|5.0|Purchased this book to keep at Nana's house.  It is a favorite of one of my grandchildren and wanted to have it here to share with all of my grandchildren and eliminate the need for Mom's packing.  The kids love hearing the animal sounds.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|We used this all day in Christmas. Great for the racing games, and the shooters, too. My boys took turns playing on the ipad, the only complaint I heard was that the controller isn't very ergonomically designed.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Enjoyed this book immensely. Wonderful story of survival and faith. Would recommend to family and friends. Definitely a must read.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This book shows Harry hasn't lost any steam along the way. I'm starting to feel a lot closer to his daughter as well, although I do wish we'd see a bit more of his partner. Can't wait for the next book, this is one series I'll pay full price for, happily.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game is the worst my whole family hares even my 9 tear old bro. this is the worst of the worst.
B00AHXDECG|4.0|I haven't bought an album produced by an entire artist in AGES!  I only bought this because I had a coupon, and my brother said it was good.  He was wrong.  It  was GREAT!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because a few of the songs sound extremely similar to one another, but I've had many of the songs stuck in my head for days now.  So that's saying something.  Way to go, Bruno!  :)
B006GECE9Y|4.0|Very fast browser. Does freeze from to time but it is quick most of the time. The graphics are nice, too.
B007U1FEJE|3.0|Musically, the album is nicely produced and some of the songs are exceptionally good. However, this collections waxes nostalgic, wistfull, and comes off as a bit existential in my book. I don't think God had much to do with this one, but an aging group of sun-bleached-boys-turned-men did. A bit of a downer. A little sad. Paradise lost. Worth a listen.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Easy read.  The writing style of this book makes it easy to read for a while and return to it a later time not giving you the feeling that you lost your place or missed something.
B004Y042N8|3.0|Fun for a while,  Glad I obtained it for free.  Engineers will like this game, try it now and have fun.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's okay.  Would like it to be more challenging.  good for all ages and levels.<br />Try it you may find it that it is what you want.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|I enjoy Daniel Day Lewis's movies but this I found hard to stay focused on. I it was too long and drawn out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Am a Freecell fan but was looking for a new solitare game for my Kindle Fire. Enjoying the new solitare as a change in pace.  Just like Freecell it can be addictive..................Jean
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Although the game is fun, while it lasts, your friends rarely show up because of all the \\"connection problems\\", any time night or day. It's hard to play a decent game without the support and help of friends. You invest time and money in the game and it resets back to level one after you have built a large town. Kindle Support and compatibility with other formats is badly needed for my Kindle Fire! Then, I'll gladly play (and of course pay) this addictive game.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I loved the book and I hope that you can do more books. l love<br />All of your books .
B009VSW15Y|1.0|My daughter recorded some really funny videos using this app and for some reason there are no options to email or share on facebook.  There is no way to get the videos off.  This app sucks.  It is alright if you just want to take pictures but you can't share them.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I am so disappointed with mockingjay. I finished it a couple days ago, but still feel like I have to finish the book because the end has left me so unfulfilled. I hope they change the ending in the movie
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I found this game to be amusing for a little while. The puzzles are interesting, you have to accomplish a task using only a certain number of tools. The game gets old after an hour or two of playing. I was able to download this as the Amazon app of the day, so no buyers remorse for me.<br /><br />4 stars for entertaining me for awhile. If I had to pay for it, I probably wouldn't \\"buy\\" it again.
1463514581|5.0|Found the continuation of the Rose Gardner Series series very enjoyable.  If anything the second book was better than the first.  I especially enjoyed the author's sense of humor that came out in the way she had Rose laughing in the face of danger and crazy situations where you would cry if you where not so busy laughing.  Good read.
B002SRQ214|5.0|If you can grab this processor for under $100 for a budget build, I highly recommend it. Paired with a GTX 560, I can max out almost everything available. Also a very easy overclock to 3.9-4.1 GHZ using the AMD autotune software.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This is a great book for all kids 7- any age. It is witty, sarcastic, and funny but this book is sometimes to short or not challenging enough. This review was written by a 10 year old.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I think it's ridiculous you have to pay to use the camera on the Kindle Fire HD. I would think that for what you pay for the device the app should come standard. I downloaded this so my granddaughter could use the camera on my Kindle. It works well and was easily installed. The app itself is simple and works well. Thumbs up for the app, thumbs down for the reason to need to download it.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Appears as though kate beckinsdale needed work, as this movie was nothing more than a showcase for her as \\"not a vampire\\". Lets face it the original wasn't really that good and this latest rendition follows in the same vein as all other remakes. Nothing wrong with the movie, just nothing right either.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I remember playing this album so much that I practically wore it out. So glad that I have it once again to play @ my whim, and my kids like hearing their 'old stuff.'
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I think I read somewhere that &#34;Snow White&#34;, not just this one- Disney too, is based on an old fairy tale. I have no idea (Disney is all I know) but I can see vague similarities between this version and Disney, they're about as much alike as most book/movie adaptations.<br />Don't show this one to small children- it's more violent with lots of sword fighting, arrow shooting and just a little blood. 9 drops of blood, 2 bloody mouths, 1 bloody forehead, 3 stabbings (1 of those bloodless) by my count. I found the first half to be slower  than the second with only a couple of battles but at least they looked impressive as did the big battle late in the movie.<br />Some reviewers bash Kristen Stewart on just about every detail, I'd give her about as much credit here as I'd give Chris Hemsworth and he did pretty well most of the time. If I were to complain about anything I noticed while watching the extended version that when Snow White drops the poisoned apple if you watch closely she drops it twice!, needed a little bit better editing there.<br />I've only watched the DVD, not the Blu ray, but the picture quality is great, depressing light/color for the more depressing parts of the story- the extended version is 4 minutes longer than the theatrical version, I'm not sure what got added. It appears to me that there are enough loose ends to the movie to make up a sequel just to resolve them, hasn't there been some talk of that?<br />I like the movie, I'm just not sure that I'll watch it many times.

B000WTBMBK|5.0|Have you ever heard an album for the first time and instantly felt a connection to a certain place or time of day?Like a love song that reminds you of your first kiss or a lyric that makes you think of a trip you took, and more importantly brings up the feelings that you felt at the time?This album does all of the above for me. I put it on at night as I lay down to sleep and drift away into my past, the spectral voices in the songs conjuring up minute details of my life that didn't seem to matter at the time but have found new meaning in the secret world that I have created in my night time haven, as  I slowly enter the dream world. This album is a hazy night time wonderland in audio form. Each listen brings up new details and snippets that I hadn't heard before, which to me is the embodiment of a good album that you just want to make a cave out of and crawl inside. The small minded arguments of the genre this record fits into<br />don't really matter to me.It is simply electronic music that has reached beyond its genre and become art.Art that acts as shelter and a safe haven for my tired soul. This is  my favourite record of all time simply because it is more than just a record to me now, and after a long day I will always look forward to turning out the lights, putting on my headphones and letting this record become my dream world, my only companion as I drift away, my best friend....
0765325950|5.0|First of all - the users who gave 1 star reviews because of a lack of an e-book and haven't even read the book are horribly misrepresenting this. If only there was a way to properly filter real reviews from petty complaints that have nothing to do with the book...<br /><br />That said, this was a fantastic conclusion to the WoT series. Riveting, epic, and impossible to put down, it answers the most important questions from the previous 13. Naturally, some go without answers and many smaller story arcs seem to dead end, but to cover all points would have led to far too much rambling...this is the best book I've read in a long time, and a fantastic ending to one of my top series.<br /><br />My main complaint regarding the actual product? The paper used for the pages is very, very thin. Think nearly tissue paper. Just means I had to be more careful than usual when turning pages.<br /><br />Now I'll have to start over from book one. And so the wheel turns again...
B00006420H|1.0|So very disappointed! It did arrive before Christmas but was sent a copy that can not be used here in US as it is not compaitable with our DVD players which I tried Three different ones. The funny thing about that is it gives you message saying it is a aboard copy and is not compatible, your company aware of this, why would I be sent this?? I am very disappointed in Amazon as this was my first purchase and may be my last. Was not aware you were not dealing with in US as this would be another reason to not support your company.....
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Our family of 6 likes to sit down and play this game when we are all together. My husband and I, our 15 year old, and our adult children all enjoy the challenge.
B007UQRW62|5.0|This is definately the collectors edition set. High quality and well appointed. Lots of interesting things if you are really into musicals, especially this one.
B0000033RY|2.0|I grew up in the 60s and 70s and listened to a lot of rock music, from Foghat to the Faces, Frampton to Frank Zappa. But somehow I didn't hear many songs from Cactus other than \\"Rock N' Roll Children\\" ... which still holds up as a pretty decent song. Based on that song, plus the reviews on here, and an urge to dig deeper into the 70s tunes that I missed, I decided to buy this compilation after seeing it on sale at a local shop, one of the few that still stocks CDs. To put it bluntly: this was not one of my more satisfactory purchases. Not quite utterly awful, but nothing particularly enjoyable either. I suppose if you are a fan of this style of blues boogie jam rock, and smoked a lot of joints, you might like this CD, but I found most of the music incredibly derivative and boring. Yes, these guys are skilled musicians, but it would help tremendously of any of them knew how to write a memorable song, something resembling a well-constructed tune, without resorting to cliched guitar riffs and overly drum solos. File this one under: stoner special.
B00785P2QC|5.0|What's Queenie the first to comment on the internet to Kentucky Wildcats and his name is blank page to nearest and has none other people who want the best way of life.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|For me, I really had to push myself to finish reading this book. It was slow, and it seemed to drag on and on. The book only covers half of the characters that the first three introduce. Queen Cersei seems to make up most of this book, followed by her brother Jamie's viewpoint.<br /><br />The first three books of this series, I simply could not put down. I would spend hours at a time reading and wanting to know what happened and what was coming next. This book just didn't do it for me. It was just so slow and I literally had to re-read some pages several times just because I couldn't get into it.<br /><br />I understand what the author was trying to do by breaking the book down and only following certain characters. But for the entire book you were left wondering what was happening with all the other characters it doesn't mention.<br /><br />The truth is, if this was the first book of the series, I wouldn't of finished it and I wouldn't of read the rest of the series. Definitely not George Martin's best work.
B004I4H8QI|5.0|good buy; if only they had the HISTORY of ERIC CLAPTON! LAYLA has always been my 'signature' EC album. FANTASTIC
0553801473|3.0|I began this book with high hopes that it would be better than the fourth one. I was quite disappointed when I started reading. Having to wait an entire book, some a book and half to find out what is going on with some characters, most of who were my favorites to follow, and them only to have a chapter or two of their own point of views was disappointing. This book wasn't as slow paced as the fourth book, but it was up there. I was really hoping to find a POV chapter for Bran or even Osha to see what was going on, but these two characters have completely disappeared since the third book.<br /><br />The first three books of this series were by far some of the best fantasy books that I have read. The fourth and fifth book were both just a let down. The book has taken so many turns, and not in a good way. Like I said before, If this was the first book in the series, I wouldn't of finished it and the rest of the series. Here's to hoping the next book in the series whenever it comes out will make up for the last two books.

B00AMBLDEE|2.0|This movie was clearly an effort to cash in on the original, successful Bourne movies, but fails miserably due to its lack of a developed plot.  There are many things they could have done with this movie that they simply did not... trying to setup a new trilogy?  Well, the first one should hook you on something interesting.  I like Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, but they were wasted on this film.

0765325950|5.0|I began the Wheel of Time series at the beginning of my junior year of college. I am a major fantasy buff, but somehow never picked up a copy of the first book until a friend let me borrow it. That moment began a very memorable journey. Robert Jordan immersed me into a rich, detailed world completely unique from other books of the genre. His ability to create interesting, realistic systems (magic, government, culture, etc) is inspiring. With that being said, he did tend to get a little long winded with all the subplots and annoying character habits - remember Nynavae's endless braid tugging? Brandon Sanderson came along and managed to neatly sweep out all of the more frustrating elements of the series and get back on track to a focused, MEANINGFUL story. If the last couple books of the series did not give you a sense of redemption and hope, I don't know what will.<br /><br />Memory of Light was my favorite book of the series, and is possibly now my favorite book in general. The scenes in the cave were incredibly vivid and intense, and the battle was brilliantly planned and written. I felt as though a war was actually playing out before me; almost on screen, except with the intimate understanding of character viewpoints only a novel can provide. I would argue the entire series is worth reading if only to finish this final installment. On a personal level, I was pleased with the authors' conclusion to Rand Al'Thor's story.<br /><br />Others reviewers: PLEASE stop giving a 1 star rating due to the fact there is not an eBook available for purchase. You are skewing the average rating of the book and possibly causing confusion about how the actual plot/writing of the book was received.
B0087ITBPC|3.0|I guess this movie is ok..I still have not recieved it. but as she is always funny in her movies..I'm sure it will be fine...
B008JFUUIA|3.0|Everyone told me how hilarious Pitch Perfect was so I had to see for myself.  I have to say I found the jokes and the one liners quite hilarious. They made the movie more watchable because it did not have the strongest plot.  It was your typical teen romance, underdog story, and I found it ironic that Becca, the main character, said she did not enjoy movies because the endings were so predictable.  That's saying a lot about this movie!  The movie was a little slow and at some points I wondered how much longer until it ended.  It was kind of a mix of Glee meets High School Musical which is a little worn out.<br /><br />  Even though it did not have the best plot in the world, I am still glad I took the time to watch it.  I feel like it was worth the hour or two to have a few laughs. It did have some sexual connotations, but I feel like it only added to the humor.  There surprisingly was not that much cussing or bad language. Of course there was some, but it was nothing major.  It is aimed more towards teens but even my mom laughed at the jokes.  Fat Amy made me laugh the entire time just because her lines were so outrageous.  In certain scences the lines were unpredictable which made them even funnier.  The singing and the song choices were also pretty good.  Most of the songs were classics or up to date mixes that everyone would know.<br /><br />  Pitch Perfect was amusing but I personally would not buy it to watch over and over. It was more of a one time rental for me.  I would not mind to watch it again, but it is not one of those movies that I would stand in line all night for.  It was not the worst movie I have seen, but it could have been better. I think it would be worth your time to sit and have some laughs and enjoy the singing.  Overall, the plot could have been a bit stronger but I thought the comedy aspect of it made up for the weak plot.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This by far, one of the best book I have ever read. Loved every minute of it. Every touch between Sky and Holder means something, and I loved that. I read some reviews that say that it started out a little slow, I can kind of see that but give it sometime. Once you get about forty percent of the way you will be hooked!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|I enjoyed this read immensely. The core values and beliefs line up with my thinking and behaviors. I appreciate the insight that leads to exponential growth financially and personally. Empowered to prosper every arena of life is where the guidance of this book will lead you. Awesome!

B001F7MSG6|5.0|I bought this Bluray without big expectation.<br />I like the director and the first series but remembered watching the second one on DVD and didn't liked it that much.<br />I finally bought this Bluray and watched it yesterday with my 7.1 channel A/v system.<br />It rocked!!!!<br />The channel divided so well (as well as his other movie Pan's Labyrinth) that my dog kept looked left and right, behind because he was so surprised at the sound coming from here and there!<br />Me too of course very much enjoyed the sound.<br />If you buy 7.1 channel A/v system, this one is the one that you should look first to test how amazing the 7.1 channel sound like.<br />Video image is also top notch.<br />The movie was decent and liked the story.<br />It's a good movie and a good price too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a really good book.. I loved the story line. It has some unexpected twists in it that keep you reading.. I haven`t read a book in  a long time that I literally could not put down.. I am a slow reader and it usually takes me awhile to finish a book, this book took me 2 days.. which is a record for me!!  I highly recommend this one!!!!
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|When I watched this movie in the theater, I felt asleep.<br />So I kinda hesitated buying this movie.<br />And they reduced the price.<br />I thought why not? I am one of the biggest Terrence's Fan.<br />I bought it and liked it.<br />It's still difficult to follow the story but it's a good try making this kind of film.<br />The only thing dissapointed me was it doesn't have a hard cover case.<br />I think they reduced the price and get rid of it.<br />That's the only complaint.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Although Robert McKee and Syd Field are the kings of structure and style, Blake Snyder is the court jester who makes it all fun.  His book pushes you to get started and gives you quick exercises to begin writing again,  it's not all fun and games, however.  He's realistic about your chances of actually selling your screenplay (which are low) but still gets you motivated to get the work done.<br /><br />He references other books and the techniques they employ and encourages you to read them as well.  Blake knows he's not the only game in town and yet he understands how to craft a screenplay form start to finish like no other.  I'm just disappointed that I never got the chance to take his in-person seminar before his untimely deaths few years ago.<br /><br />Even in death Blake keeps me motivated.

B000I8ERVC|5.0|This was a &#34;movie night&#34; special from my dad. Definitely not a let down. It's nice watching older movies, sometimes, because the style is so much different than what we get nowadays.
B00005JKL8|3.0|This movie arrived on time and in good condition.  It is not going to win any awards, but it has explosions, guns, and planes.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I didn't expect this to turn into a date movie. That's my major gripe. I wanted more humor and less lovey-dovey.
B000002KAT|5.0|This product arrived on time and in good condition.  It is my favorite Van Morrison album and I can listen to it over and over again.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I fell asleep during part of this movie because it was so boring. That's not normal for me. It had some good moments but they typically kept my interest by being confusing, not intriguing.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie arrived on time and in good condition. It is a wonderful work and special to anyone who has been lucky enough to have been to Japan.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I really liked the prequels to this movie, but I guess I was young when I saw them or their content was more mature, because this movie felt very geared towards children. Not bad, though.
B000089Q9D|5.0|This product arrived on time and in good condition. Don't let the fact that this is a foreign movie scare you, it is one of the best movies you will ever see.

B002R22PB6|3.0|I had to watch this movie for a school project. It is in Spanish so an English speaker would have to watch the entire thing by subtitles. It had a meaningful plot, but I don't see myself wanting to watch it again.

B0002TJGQS|5.0|excellent product as it says in its description without problems<br />The presentation is equal to that of the picture<br />very good price
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|I won't spend much time on the film itself.  Suffice to say the film is amazing, it was nominated for several Academy Awards, but took home zero - but it had to compete with 'The Last Emperor'.  Tough year.  Spielberg considers this film one of his most profound.  It takes place in and around Shanghai from 1941 to 1945.  It centers around Jim, a spoiled youth (played by a young and talented Christian Bale) who is separated from his parents during the Japanese invasion and forced to live in a prison camp.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is stunning to say the least.  There are a few shots where the film really stands out, mainly the scenes involving planes flying over.  There are also some stunning shots in and around the prison camp and airstrip.  The sound is also well updated and will give your sound system a workout.<br /><br />The included booklet is a nice addition but not really as interesting as the booklets included in similar releases (such as Amadeus).  The additional disc is a documentary about Warner Brothers during WW2.  Interesting, but self appreciative to say the least.  It's Warner tooting their horn about their contribution to the war effort.  If you like documentaries you will probably find it average.  If you want more back story on World War 2, then go for 'The War' by Ken Burns.<br /><br />So yes.  Great film. Beautiful Blu-Ray.  But worth it?  Currently the Blu-Ray is going for $26 and change.  It's not really worth it at that price for everyone.  Those who love the film may want to pick it up.  But I suspect the price will drop, as usual with the major studio Blu-Ray re-releases.  I've picked some of these up for $10 and under after they've been out a year or so.  So if you are patient, then you might want to wait for a price drop (always the risk of the film going out of print though...).  It makes it tough when I've picked up the collectors edition Blu-Ray boxed sets (with tons of swag) for Casablanca ($29) and Sound of Music ($24) at around the same price.<br /><br />I recommend renting or checking it out from your local library if you're not sure about purchasing.  (I checked mine out from my local library on Blu-Ray - thank you Washington County!)e price.<br /><br />I recommend renting or checking it out from your local library if you're not sure about purchasing.

B009VB7QQA|1.0|Sorry to have donated a few bucks for, no doubt, the worst excuse for entertainment we have ever spent...Amazon buyers must never had watched this trash for even ten minutes...I left the room after six minutes and my wife and neighbor shut it off after about thirty minutes. What a cheap hollywood ploy on a great name...blasphemy,
B000002L80|5.0|Great band and the music is still good today.  My kids heard the songs and they love them.  Its one of the first set of songs we listen to in the car..
B002SSUQFG|4.0|The watch is great, you only really only lose two minutes by the end of the week if you keep the watch on most of the time. The design is alright at best, but for the price a Seiko V can't be beat. These watches are trustworthy and they won't s*** out on you. My only complain is the band, even though the watch isn't very big I would say get a new band if you have small wrists. I would say I would get this watch if you're looking for something casual to wear, and switch the band if you want to upgrade the look a bit.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I thought this game sounded pretty lame but I decided to give it a try. I'm very glad I did! It's one of those games that hooked me immediately! If you're looking for a game that requires concentration and challenges your mind this is not it. But if you're looking for mindless fun, this is the game for you!
B000QUEQBS|5.0|I think Mark Wahlberg did a pretty god job in this movie. It is fast paced & keeps you interested throughout the film. The Blu-Ray is pretty nice, [better than the dvd}. The color & sound were both pretty good also. I listen with external speakers hooked up to an older stereo system so I have nothing fancy, just good old stereo, & it sounded fine. I'm glad they did this in the 2:40:1 aspect ratio, especially because of all the outdoor scenes. In 1:85:1 I always feel like I'm missing part of the movie. The special features are pretty good too. They have a Commentary: Deleted scenes: The making of the movie: Independence Hall: & a Trailer. Overall for the money, I paid $11.49, & it took a long time to come down to this price, I think I made a good purchase. Check it out, I think you will like this film.
0743487486|5.0|Book contains lots of refreshing wisdom. Things that I felt deeply inside that weren't ok like time outs, treating children like not-humans and having free pass to be kids boss.. all the bad advices that I hear around...it feels good to know that I am not the only one that believes children are humans like you and me and need us, parents, to remember this!
B007HACDLK|5.0|The book was so good I couldn't put it down.  It had an authenticity about it and I felt I had intimate knowledge of the CIA and how the black ops operated.  It is very believable and the main character, Mitch Rapp is intriguing and exciting.  After I finished this book I began reading the Mirch Rapp series in the order of publication.
B000VX0416|5.0|I have had my eye on these shoes for a long time.the timberland 50009 is a very good shoe that i would buy again.
