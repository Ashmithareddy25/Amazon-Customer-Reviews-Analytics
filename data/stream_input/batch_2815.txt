B000QGEB12|5.0|If you want do some serious laughing, buy this dvd.  Although, graphic in some scenes, it is absolutely hilarious and entertaining.  My entire family loved it!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I've been having trouble sleeping so I downloaded this app it works wonders I love the rain and flute combo now I sleep like a baby
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I really love this show. Why? It gets to be one of those shows that really let's you wonder if something like this stargate could ever come into exsistance.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Fun game which is very addicting in a good way. I always enjoy Big Fish games. Good graphics and story. Having trouble stopping play but feel it is great brain training.
B00009W0WM|5.0|This was definitely worth every penny. We have watched this classic over and over. And it is a good keepsake to have because this is the best movie every made. An excellent purchase.
B00BEIYMTW|1.0|Disney's production company, Pixar, has found a great deal of success with their popular Cars franchise, combining for more than $1 billion worldwide. It has featured the voices of some of Hollywood's finest and funniest, including Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, and Michael Caine.  Following two successful animated features, Cars and Cars 2, the franchise has also spawned spin-off television programs, video games, and even theme park attractions.  Like most things associated with Disney, the merchandise possibilities are endless for animated features and with the addition of more vehicles - so is the direction of the franchise.  Now, the Cars franchise has expanded its potential by adding Planes - a Cars spin-off that focuses on animated planes as the main characters.<br /><br />Klay Hall (Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure) directs the Cars spin-off, Planes, starring the voice of Dane Cook as Dusty Crophopper, a crop dusting airplane that tries out for the Wings Across the World race.  In order to win the race, planes are required to be fast and agile - and able to work through an obstacle course at high speeds.  However, even though Dusty is fast, he's not fast enough and must enlist the help of a former war veteran, Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach), to mentor and prepare him for the big race.  The voices of Teri Hatcher, Brad Garrett, Roger Craig Smith, and Julia Louise-Dreyfus also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />The idea of animated cars only seemed logical, especially since bugs, toys, and anything else you can imagine is receiving the animation treatment.  With that rational, the next logical step was to expand the cars universe by adding planes to the mix.  And, after watching Planes, you'd assume future films will include trains, boats, or bikes.  Like I said, the future is endless.  But, before we get that far ahead, the focus is on Planes, which is essentially the same exact thing as the Cars films - only in plane form.  The Cars films are about racing, and Planes is about racing, too.  So, if you were to combine the elements of the first two Cars films and set it in the air, then that would make Planes a completely recycle story - which it is.<br /><br />Even from the debut of its first trailer, Planes looked like it had the potential to run out of gas even before it made its way off the runway.  Sure enough, Planes looks and smells like every generic animated film out there these days, incorporating the same old underdog elements and sideline cheerleaders.  On top of the constant clich&eacute;s is the fact that animation films focusing on the premise of racing are simply getting old.  Cars and its sequel focused on speed, not to mention Turbo - so it might be a stretch to imagine a Planes sequel focusing on a similar theme of the same generic story.  It's certainly time for them to think outside the box and come up with something a little more hip and entertaining.<br /><br />The supporting cast this time around includes forklifts and airplanes with different nationalities, meaning there are Spanish, British, and several other themed planes to round out the worldwide ethnicity race around the world.  Some of the familiar voices of this film include Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a French Canadian racing plane, Carlos Alazraqui as a lovesick Spanish plane (that is decked out like a Mexican wrestler), and Brad Garrett of Everybody Love Raymond fame as Dusty's main sidekick.  Sadly, none of these characters are remotely interesting, humorous, or worthy of living on in the folklore of animation fame.<br /><br />Overall, there aren't very many interesting things to say about this animated spin-off.  Planes simply doesn't make an effort to stand out against a crowed group of animated features, including Despicable Me 2 and Turbo - all of which are desperate to gain the attention of parents.  Dane Cook is certainly an interesting choice for a leading role, and actually excels in the position, but a weak supporting cast and a one-dimensional, predictable story will barely entertain the kids.  You'll be making a better choice if you just pop the Cars DVD in at home and wait for Planes to hit video.<br /><br />GRADE: D+<br />FNDNreview.comensional, predictable story will barely entertain the kids.

1416549447|5.0|I brought it for my husband who is an avid runner.  It is great book that tells about the importance of form in running. getting the right body posture and foot movement etc., Great purchase if you are into running.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|My husband and I love this show! We have seen all of the episodes more than once and we are just watching them all again from the beginning.<br />Wonderful characters, great acting with weird, interesting, and imaginative story lines!
B0000669JL|5.0|This is a good price for a classic product. It has all of Bob Marley's most popular songs and was perfect as a gift to my son.
B004QDCZ3M|5.0|I love Florence and the machine! This is a great album I'm not sure I'll ever get tired of listening to!
B005LAIHR2|4.0|When we watched this at the movies I knew that we had to have a copy of it to keep.  It was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I love Florence and the machine! This is a great album I'm not sure I'll ever get tired of listening to!
B00684J49U|4.0|Always a big fan of this TV series and my daughter had to have it for her collection.  Never disappointing
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie was one of those that didn’t really appeal to me by the advertisements, Twilight Zombies or some such was a term I had heard, so I ended up skipping this while it was in theaters. My, that was a mistake. I recently rented this on Amazon Instant Video on the advice of my co-worker who usually is a good judge of entertainment, she hasn’t lead me wrong yet. I really enjoyed this movie. From the very beginning it starts out with this wonderful humor and Nicholas Hoult narration as the zombie R is stellar. This is probably one of the most unique retellings of Romeo and Juliet that I have seen and it worked really well. One thing that I really enjoyed about this movie was one of its themes is how as a society we are always connected to the world as a whole, we become more disconnected to the people around us. The overall notion of love is what ties us all together was extremely wonderful and worked quite well. The one thing about this movie that bugged me a little is how easily people accepted things that they’ve trained themselves not to it struck me unrealistic to the characters as they were portrayed but from a time setting they didn’t really have the time to develop this fully. If you’re looking for a quirky romance movie, filled with humor and charm then this is one you should consider.<br /><br />This is on the Green Embers’ Recommended List!
B00005JSGK|5.0|I love watching them catch the animals, I love the elephants (my favorite animal) and I love the characters for the most part. The useless relationship drama is my least favorite thing about it, but it is pretty minimal. I watched this movie probably 3 times in the first day after it came in the mail. Such a fun movie. :)
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Hysterically funny! Laughed so hard I cried (more than once). Can't wait to find out what happens next. This is a book I'll read again and again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such an awesome app!!!!! You need to get this app now<br />Boss awesome great app must get!!!! Subway suffers is one of the best games that<br />I ever played plz get this game Cuz it is awesomeness
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Boooooooo!!!!!! Ever since ceasar took over it went down the DRAIN!!!! IT SUCKS. They claim to be free but will get u addicted to get cash out of u...save u some trouble n don't even start
B000ICXQOM|5.0|This movie was done in the early 1980's so the grafics are diferent. They really are good not ,sure how they set it all up? Like I said it is just a fun movie . Sit down with a couple of beers and have at it. I am not sure but I think this is the first time I ever heard of Bruce campbell. He really was great in this part, I hope you all find enjoyment in this movie like I did!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really get this app its perfect on long road trips and its wire less you can go. any where with this app don't listen to the people that have bad rates and it puts no vireses on so get this app
B00ECUARO8|4.0|One of the better movies you will see for what it cost to make.  Solid performances.  I may watch it again.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Twist and turns, makes you think a lot, and makes you think about it after for awhile. Love IT!- KR
030758836X|4.0|Whatever happened to just desserts? I kept thinking, \\"wait for it . . . wait for it . . . wait for it . . .\\" I am still waiting. I was angry the entire time I read this book.  NEW UPDATE: I changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars because I am STILL upset about this story, I can't stop talking about it -telling people how ridiculous and upsetting it is- so it must be worthy of 4 stars, right?  It hurts so good!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book will become part of you, you will carry it with you as you experience the side effect of living
B00004YRQA|5.0|I had a Ps2 since it first came out.So I bought a few games and started playing.But when i tried to save the game I couldn't.So i looked to see if there was anything to save the games and I found this 8MB Memory card.<br />Now the Memory isn't an accessorie but is actually important.Without this you will never save any game and will have to restart your game from the beginning.<br />I was glad to have this Memory card.By 2010 I had over 200 games and needed alot of space for the games.So I went ahead and bought a Memory card that was 64Mb but sadly it didn't work.<br />So I went ahead and bought a 128MB memory card but that didn't work.So I went ahead and bought a 8MB card and it worked perfectly.<br />Not like the 64MB that always Corrupted my game files and didn't allow me to save.<br />Now the 128MB Card worked but it glitched my games and glitched when I tried to save.(But it did allow me to save...sometimes..)<br />Now the 8MB card was so good that I bought 4 ones and they worked perfectly.<br />I'm happy with my purchase and now I keep buying more games(Buying kingdom Hearts I,Chain of Memories,And Kingdom Hearts II,And Okami)<br />Hope I helped you with your decision on Wether to buy a 128MB Memory Card,64MB Memory card,Or the powerful 8MB card.:)
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|A fun game for sure, and super entertaining, but quits on me at the last part of level 4. Hoping for an update soon!
B00CATSONE|3.0|I felt like I'd read a reader's digest article when I'd finished this.<br />There's much more to Tesla. He was a genius and deserves to have a well written book about his life.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|This was a disgustingly hilarious book.  I was surprised how detailed the book gets in certain parts of Jordan's day and life, but it certain paints a vivid picture.  I loved the written style of the book.  It was like sitting with Jordan as he opens up about his life, and he seems like a hilarious guy.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love it. Not only can you add effects to the pictures but it is also a meme generator. Its great
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|its fun but there is a lot of loading and waiting. it a clever idea though the costumes cost too much.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Man....Disney has made some great movies but this has to be one of their greatest.  Super funny with great animation and story.<br />The whole movie is centered around video game characters and is just hilarious.  Definitely a must buy for the family or just for yourself.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It's got a surprising twist but if you are a scifi fan, you could see it coming. It's slow, it could have been a little faster.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|We love being able to keep in touch with friends and loved ones that live far away or even those<br />that live nearby.You do a fantastic job. Thank you for making this possible!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book was easy to read.  it held my attention unlike other history books.  The author surely did his homework.  The author seems at least for me to help put pieces together of a story and history that has become disjointed by different agendas, traditions, politics, and personal beliefs.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I heard this song on the radio and instantly loved it I recommend to any Lady gaga fans and music listeners in general you'll love this song! It's pop gold :-D I can't get it outta my head Wooooh!
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|It's no Shawn of the Dead but for zombie fans it is certainly a different take on the genre.  worth a date night.
B00280LYIM|4.0|It's a good book that will make you want to read more I just wish the reading level was a little bit higher
B0053TMP24|5.0|Continuing the story with Percy as well as adding new, and well needed characters! Only complaint is the release date of the next book, which can't be helped. A great read and highly recommended!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter because we missed the play at Broadway Theater in Pitman.  We liked the movie better anyway!  Thanks.
B00DYWO09I|4.0|Solid game with good touch enabled control scheme. A pity that they didn't include the original! A good action platformer that I can recommend to every gamer out there.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was so confused as was katniss but at the end it all made sense i ran around saying how good the book was very cleaver book really want the second one because of that horrible cliff hanger but im poor and i will do all that i can to get money for this book that is how good it is...i dont care if the book is 50$ i would still get it its that good MUST READ IT :D
B00DURILJ2|1.0|Can not download movie. What's up with that.  Please let me know. What you will do for me thank you
B000V39KDO|5.0|THE CINEMATIC STYLE WAS EXTRAORDINARY AS IT TOLD THE STORY OF COURAGE UNDER FIRE.<br />I AM HAPPY WITH THE FILM RENDERING OF A ACTUAL HISTORICAL EVENT AND WITH THE AMAZING SKILL OF THE ACTORS INVOLVED.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|My kiddos adore this show. It was recently removed from Netflix instant queue which was absolutely devestating to them. Amazon Prime saved the day! Thank you!
B004D5H2M2|5.0|MANY MOVIES HAVE TANGERINE DREAM SCORING THE SOUND TRACKS.  THEY SET MOODS FOR FOLKS SO THAT WE WILL REMEMBER THEM.  I PUT THEM ON AND SEAT MYSELF TO DO WORK THAT COMES EASIER WITH EACH TUNE PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|They makes deals with the devil and my wife thinks they're hot.  Correction, they kill demons and send the devil to hell.  Second correction I don't know what I am talking about.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|This game is amazing. However, it has already crashed twice since i have downloaded it yesterday. I also don't like the fact that you have to pay coins just to play. But i guess that's how this game makes its money.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Worked very well!  A bit pricey but you get what you pay for!  This gets my thumbs up all day long review!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|First off, let me admit that if price was not a consideration, this would be a 4 STAR review. The dividers could have been a little firmer and coated in nylon and the bottom could have been filled with memory foam but not at this price! This bag does everything a camera bag is supposed to do and it does it well! It transports, protects, and organize all I need for a shoot. It is a much higher quality than a similar bargain brand I purchased. The front pocket is bigger, the sections are deeper, and the overall feel is high quality. So glad I bought it!
B007RTAR64|2.0|I was very excited after placing my order for this doll. katniss is my favorite character and I really couldn't wait to be clenching her in my own dirty mitts. Much to my dismay the doll finally arrived and it was WAY smaller than I thought it would be. The anatomy was not realistic nor did it have the three life like holes I've come to expect when ordering my other celebrity dolls from Amazon. I've since wrote the manufacturer to assist me with my problems and request a more lifesized, anatomically correct Katniss doll. They said they could accommodate my request but it would cost a bit more than this model. Anyways, if your intent is to make love to a replica of Miss Everdeen this is not the doll you're looking for.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The actors are superior, the story is gripping and the scenery and costuming is perfect.  This whole series is one of the best I have ever seen on TV.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like it! I don't know what happens when you get all the dragons through.I still give it a five-star rating!
B005UBNL0A|5.0|Overclocked to a steady 4.6ghz 100 percent stable no problems at all. This thing really doesn't get that hot if you have a good water or liquid cooler. I keep it at the max of 4.2 stock voltage with the turbo core turned off and cool and quiet turned on so I can get the most out of it and hope to get a long lifespan which I should I keep it very cool at 38c. Jumps to 55c max load on skyrim. 65c when stressed to its max. Overall 4/5. I wish I could get a stable 5ghz out of it but everytime I do temps goes thru the roof when gaming and it overloads my system reaching 200 degrees.
0425266060|5.0|What an amazing book. I found myself comparing a lot at the beginning to 50 shades of Grey, but by the middle of the first book it was definitely in a league of it's own.
B00821OX98|5.0|Loved it and couldn't wait to see Season 2. So many twists and turns with a number of promising plotlines.
B009YBTZ8O|5.0|I saw the animated film first and it was lovely, but this was amazing. It was everything I loved but more, it was so much richer so much more believable and coherent, The adventure feels so much more present and you get to really know Sophie. It was wonderful and even more magical, I love it!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Reza Aslan is an excellent writer with a wealth of knowledge about the politics and culture of Israel and Rome at the time of Christ.  By examining the birth of Christianity within this framework, the author is able to make some reasonable deductions about the motivations of the Christ of history and the motivations of the authors of Christian scriptures.  I studied these issues as an undergraduate in 1970 so I was not surprised by Aslan's basic contention that Christ was a Jew motivated primarily by his love of Israel and the Torah.  Nor was I shocked by the suggestion that St. Paul can be reasonably credited with working out much of the theology that deified Jesus of Nazareth in the early Christian communities that were largely converts from the Greeks, Romans, and Greek speaking and enculturated Jews.  However, Mr. Aslan's writing is engaging and keeps the reader anticipating the next interesting historic detail.  I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.  Christians and non-Christians can profit by reading this book.  Especially since their are many parallels between the global religious violence of today and that in the days of Jesus.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice to see multiple locations. Like the hourly temp. Good up to the minute weather. Nice to know weather quality.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|When our daughter enjoyed Les Miserable, I knew she's get a kick out of this as well.  Some of the songs are now dated, 10 years later, so she didn't get all the song title references but she still enjoyed the great story-telling and effects.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|This is a Great Movie! Some had doubts about how good it was going to be when first announced but I can tell you its just as good as MLP:FIM is!<br /><br />Its worth a buy for kids and adults alike! Its a fun ride from beginning to end and for sure it is one that you will not want to miss!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love my kindle fire. I am able to do whatever I want to do on it.I love to read books on it because I can increase the size of the text. It is reasonably priced. I do not have any comments for this products.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A wonderful love story, passionate, endearing, and even witty at times.  I wasn't expecting such an intense love story, and a nice change with both main characters having insecurities.  I was disappointed when I was finished, I could have read about their lives together through many more books.  Thank you E L James for transporting me into this interesting and enjoyable story!!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Zombies are awesome.  This zombie head rules.  And it scares the s*** out of my gf when she comes  home from work.... best investment in a long time.    hahaha
0425263908|5.0|I love love love this series...OMG!!! I am so enamored with Eva and Gideon's love story that once I picked up the first book I had to order the next two so that I could keep reading without having to wait. It is an exciting romantic trilogy and I would recommend getting all three in the series because you will want to keep reading. Be warned..there are plenty of very explicit sex scenes in the book...so well-written that you might need to take a cold shower after reading...so nobody under 17 should read this in my opinion. I look forward to whatever Sylvia Day writes next!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Simply awesome and fun for kids of all ages!! Highly recommended down load for your kindle or Pc. and its toatally free!!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|However it might be best that it wasn't. Move the hint button off the main page. Too easy to just poke it.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Best movie I've rented all year.  Matthew McConaughey does a wonderful job.  Oscar worthy. Modern day Stand By Me.  Rent it, you won't be disappointed.
0393327345|5.0|It seems like most movie inspiring books are doomed to sit on a well-meaning shelf of 'oh I must read the book that cool movie came from' - but Fight Club at least has just escaped that dusty place.<br /><br />Most bizarrely, I'm used to such books having more depth, themes, and complexity than film versions, however Fight Club is much the opposite. At 200 (short) pages Palahniuk creates a flighty, crazy, high-paced story of 'Mr ?????' an his insomniac creation of Fight Club.<br /><br />For anyone familiar with the film, this book will add little and almost seemed like I was reading a 'book of the movie' rather than the original work.<br /><br />It's hard to judge how a naive reader would find this book - but given the importance of the major twist I would actually recommend watching the brilliant film and enjoying the intensity of everything (as having it spoiled by the book will reduce the experience of the film)
B000P0J09W|5.0|This movie is a great addition to our collection. A great movie for Family nights. Highly recommended. Do not forget the popcorn.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I started watching season 1 of Suits one day on Amazon when there just wasn't anything else that seemed interesting.  My husband and I were instantly addicted to the show!  We flew through the first season, and are onto Season 2. LOVE this show!  Very clever, humorous and story lines keep me wanting to move right on to the next episode immediately.
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|This movie is a great addition to our collection. A great movie for Family nights. Highly recommended. Do not forget the popcorn.
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|It gives little news and supposes that the reader is interested in the minutiae of the lives of a lot of boring celebrities
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Well it's The Goonies, what do you expect.  A classic from my childhood that my children will still watch today.  Still a great movie.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I've always loved the Beatles - grew up listening to their music, so this CD is a perfect addition to my music collection.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like being able to see what the weather is going to be as well as the maps for my favorite destinations.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|I love almost every song on this CD!  I also purchased the &#34;More Music from Country Strong&#34; and that is also fantastic:-)
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|I already had a link set up for my gmail account and then it stopped working and I had to PURCHASE this one and it opens in landscape instead of portrait style.  I can't find my contacts and it didn't update my contacts that were currently in my other account.  I'm not real happy about having to change.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and exciting to play.  Challenge you to think and remember. Very addictive. Could not put it down. Had the whole family wanting to escape a room. We even challenged our skills by using a timer. I need more games like this.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Very pleased with this mouse. Performs well during everyday tasks and gaming.<br /><br />-Nice weight feel/Management<br /><br />-Solid build/Movement<br /><br />-Comfortable in both claw grip and palm grip<br /><br />-Macros record easily on the fly<br /><br />-Aesthetic look<br /><br />-Plenty of buttons that you can program how you see fit<br /><br />-Reasonable price<br /><br />5/5
B002A9THA8|5.0|this movie is awsome - it is a 80's classic -  if you love 80's movies and music - watch this
B00006JIA4|5.0|Excellent customer service, Cd's in great condition & love queen. Great deal too! Wish it had a few more of the american classics has more of the euro classics but that's my bad I just have to buy the other greatest hits bc there are like 3 or 4 volumes!! So be sure when purchasing you are getting the one with all the hits you love!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This series should never have gone on this long.  Their relationship has become so very boring.  It's even more disappointing that the book didn't end here.  She's going to drag out another one!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This is a good film, primarily because it seems to borrow from every other sci-fi film I like. You like terminator? Check. You like Blade Runner? Check. <fill in about a dozen more movies here> ... the Roeper review said it was like a talented cover band ... not original, but well executed. I agree - CGI was really good, acting okay. Plot dragged in spots, ending was a little empty, and I felt they could have made a better movie if they edited down ~20-30 minutes out of it.<br /><br />But overall, I enjoyed it.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|...I'd enjoy this one as much as I did.  I've always found this director's movies to be WAY too precious by half.  This one worked, I believe, because of the actors who bought into the vision.  Briefly incongruous and anachronistic but the charm is not diminished.  This is much more &#34;adult&#34; than I expected.  The kids won't be watching this one until they are a little older...
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Using YouTube to download videos and NetFlix, I can amuse myself in the kitchen while I fix meals, clean up, or even sit at the kitchen table with my morning coffee.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Critics found this film to be either a beautiful surprise, a simple labor of love, or a spectacularly difficult endeavor that didn't quite gel.  I fall somewhere in-between.  One cannot fault the special effects or acting--sometimes the actors aren't even recognizable in their roles--and it can be entertaining to watch a couple of them play outside their usual character types.  I didn't \\"hate\\" watching it but it went on for longer than it needed to for the message to get across.
B001F6TXME|5.0|This product is easy to use and does what I expected it to do. I would recommend this device to my friends and relatives.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Quentin began his revisionist historical accounts with Inglourious Basterds and continues with this look at a black bounty hunter who wants to be reunited with his still-a-slave wife.  The acting alone is worth the price of admission.  This film made me think and that is icing on the cake.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|great cast..greats acting...great scenes....great local..be sure you get this movie..Very entertaining ..Maggie Smith has always been one of my favorites
B00BHMETKC|3.0|According to Oscar, mebbe, but not to me.  It was diverting and well-done but not the kind of movie I would own.  Some may enjoy its (slightly) modified history and '70s fashions; the screenplay's not bad, either.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A awesome book. For the last half, I couldn't stop crying. Be sure to not read somewhere public where you don't want to cry.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|The first being Insidious.<br />The wife and I enjoyed this movie.  There are moments of extreme tension--many more than most \\"scary\\" films we watch when we would like to have that frightening feeling of dread.  Clever moments done very well.  It will obviously be Part I of a series...
B000YJ54DU|5.0|As usual Child does it again.  He is a great story teller and can weave a believable tale always with a great deal of detail.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book has a good story line and likable and believable characters. A great, &#34;what if&#34; fantasy told with humor and heart.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|What a Wonderfull world it would be! Great Tunes from a Great Master! He is Missed!Wish he was still With Us!
B000W8HC8I|1.0|The Wolf of Wall Street was very disappointing. I hated the character and the writers praise for him. He was a cheat, and drug user, which was glorified. I stopped reading it.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This is a very funny movie with great actors and a good story line!  I recommend it for any mature audience!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book to the hunger games is so twisted but in a very good way. Once I started the book I just couldn't put it down.
B000NY12LO|4.0|Being a former educator for 30 years, I saw many of the instances described in Nineteen Minutes. Picoult takes a very heinous crime and attempts rather successfully to humanize the perpetrators.  I looked forward to reading it every evening; maybe that accounts for restless nights.  I would reccomend this book as long as you know the subject matter.
1582701709|5.0|This book is awesome. I still have it and I look at it still from time to time........Thank you !!!!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I probably enjoyed this novel more than any work of fiction I've read in the past few years, but then, I don't read a whole lot of fiction.  It was light reading and amusing, not hilarious as some have said, but certainly worth the entertainment.  I can imagine it being made into a movie.<br /><br />The Kindle version is very good, very few typos, the most notable exception being &#34;Roosevek&#34; twice when &#34;Roosevelt&#34; was meant.  Also, it's a good thing for me to get the Kindle version because I am far more likely to read the book straight through.  I have a bad habit of skipping to the end of paper versions just to see how everything ends.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to just about anyone looking for a lightweight, amusing novel that won't require any deep analysis.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|A little sex, a little humor, a lot of drama, and a lot of awesome storyline make for a great series! It has bits and pieces for the men and the women... and you don't have to have read the books to enjoy it. My husband hasn't read any of the books and thoroughly enjoys the show. I have read all the books and also love the show!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best series for years on TV.  Please advise when Season 4 begins.  thank you very, very much-
B009FZHYKU|3.0|If I have to look at the stupid prison any more I am going to throw the tv. This show is not as awesome as seasons 1 or 2. It isn't bad, but I keep waiting for the magic to come back.

B009UZBLSG|5.0|I plugged this into my new Nexus 7 tablet and used an HDMI cable to plug it into a TV.  Easy.  Worked great.  No problems.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Overlooking the irritating writing quality, it is really a good story. Entertaining, page turner. I recommend this to anyone that is into YA books, particularly those with a romance twist.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|movie is a classic every body show own the dvd if they collect movies, and if they dont collect movies they should still own one
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I'm house stark. Mostly because I am married to John Snow. Best series from HBO since forever! I just wish they would add season 3 to amazon since the finale leaves you hanging. Arya is awesome, my favorite strong female lead on tv right now. Start with season 1 so you &#34;get it&#34; but totally watch this series. It is a masterpiece.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Fun game...lots to do yet easy enough for my the yr old grand daughter to enjoy. LOADS of characters from the movie keep her happy
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|The kiddo loves this, we love this. It has turned into a tradition- we read the book and watch the movie. Wholesome, moral, entertaining, great animation.
1476733953|2.0|This is an excellent 330 page book... crammed into 537 pages.<br /><br />I say 330 because that's where I gave up, even though I loved it: the concept, the characters, the storytelling were all working for me; it was just way, way too much filler, like a short story that had been dragged out (and dragged out) (and dragged out) (and...) to make some kind of word count.<br /><br />It's a bit like if you were reading a murder mystery, and every time the detective went anywhere, you got twenty pages about how he started his car and whether he fueled it or decided to wait to fuel it and how the keys jangled and... There's just a level of detail here that becomes tedious, incredibly repetitious and ultimately meaningless. I don't really need to know what every step on the staircase was like. Or just how someone solved some minor problem, or come back to the same person doing the same thing in the same place with little or no progress despite pages and chapters having passed.<br /><br />I thought maybe the author had some reason or purpose for all this, but finally came to conclude he wasn't willing to let anyone edit and cut.<br /><br />At 330, I started to skim... which I never do. Then I started to skip. I normally don't have the confidence to do that with a book, but here I skipped whole pages, whole chapters, and seemed to have missed nothing. In fact, I did miss nothing. You could have ripped out one, two, ten pages at a time and if no one told you those pages had been there, you'd never miss them.<br /><br />That's the problem: way too many paragraphs, pages and chapters like that.<br /><br />Apparently, this was a short story and/or is a bunch of short stories cobbled together. If someone ever edits it down into a book, it'll be very good one.<br /><br />Until then, the best way to describe it is to say that the rock-to-ore ratio is way too high. Unless you have unlimited to time and patience and there's absolutely nothing at all interesting going on in your life,at some point, you'll get sick of mining.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game!taking care of a horse is a lot of fun.the only problem is that every time I click on free gems it says service error so I can't get gems.if anyone can fix this let me know.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I had the same issue as some people have with it loading and saying update. It did this four times for me. I would open the app and it said New update. I would go into the store to update but there was no update for it. I took it off my device and downloaded it again. Same thing happened. So after three more times of uninstalling the game and downloading it again, it finally worked, but I have to start from the very beginning. I was really far and was hoping to get back everything I had but I don't see that happening. I will continue to play unless this happens again.

B005GHN2GG|5.0|Initially this cover make me feels that the story emphasize on the sorcerers, magic, politic, battle, war etc etc, with a little hint of romance. But after I finish it, I would say this is actually a fantasy romance with heavy emphasize on the interaction between H/h.<br /><br />The story started of with Silhara 'Master of Crows', a powerful sorcerer requested for an apprentice from the Conclave (imagine evil government)to help him with some deciphering. At this point, it was pointed out that Silhara was trying to battle the Corruption (imagine evil demon).<br /><br />Martise was of course the apprentice that was being sent. On the surface, she was suppose to help Silhara and in return he will help her to discover her Gift (magic). But Conclave wanted her there as a spy (though she didn't manage to do much spying work). She was bind to the Conclave by some magic as some sort of slave. So in order to gain her freedom, she needed to deliver 'information' on Silhara. From the beginning, Silhara knows that Martise will be a spy because she is from the Conclave. So there is not mystery there or any doubt. What I like about Martise is that she is not an innocent young lady. She knows hardship and knows what she want in her life. When she falls for Silhara, she embrace the fact decided without a doubt that she won't betray him even though he haven't reciprocate her feelings yet. I'm not sure when it started, but I think she falls for him somewhere between learning he work manual labor in his farm without using magic or when he reveal some of his past to her. The past I like most is when he talk about his relationship with the oranges.<br /><br />When I started with this book, I found it was so beautifully written and I thought I was actually reading a literature instead of a romance book. We seldom came across such beautiful writing in bodice ripper or PNR romance. But fear not, this book is not all serious stuff, there is some funny moments as well.<br /><br />You know most of the time, we read about sorcerer and warrior doesn't have any actual job, beside battling and plotting. But Silhara actually own a farm of oranges and he actually work as a farmer. He had a mute servant, Gurn, who acted like his best buddy. And a smelly mutt name Cael. The interaction between Martise with his household was kinda fun to read. And not before long, Martise had already won over his household from Silhara.<br /><br />The most WOW moment was during the smack down between Silhara and Martise ex-lover boy. All I can say it, although I was shocked, it also melted my knee right there.<br /><br />Grace Draven can manage to make you feel down and then straight away uplift your mood in the same page itself. The most memorable part of the story is when Silhara ordered Gurn to get him a prostitute because he wanted to stop himself from thinking about Martise too much. Then lovely Gurn reluctantly followed his ordered and get him the most expensive and high end prostitute just to piss his master off. I feel in love with Gurn right there and then. So how did Silhara response to that situation? All I will say is Gurn got lucky!<br /><br />The climax was Silhara working with Conclave to battle the Corruption (did I mentioned that the Corruption keep haunting him and wanted to possess him?). Martise play a role here as well, not just sit at home and wait for her hero to return or may not return.<br /><br />This story is about sacrifices you make to love one without asking anything in return. This story is about sorcerer, so when we say sacrifices, it means something big, it means your LIFE. Not about sacrificing your status or money and what not.<br /><br />I'm so glad I found this book, because it was not often gush upon by my fellow Goodreads friends.st of the time, we read about sorcerer and warrior doesn't have any actual job, beside battling and plotting.

B008GX2YQQ|2.0|First I would like to say I am a very religious fan of Animal Collective. I own all of there albums and LPs and DVDs and have seen them on tour 3 times. After Listening to this album more than 10 times I can safely say this is the sloppiest most rushed sounding album that they have made. It comes off as a band trying to sound like Animal Collective. I have never been annoyed by Avey Tares vocals before this record (Especially on Mercury Man). After Aveys solo album \\"Down There\\" he has been using this weird effect on his voice. It doesn't sound good it, sounds cheap and annoying. I can tolerate the first four songs but after that I am not going to lie to myself and become a mindless fan that gives everything they do high praise. Maybe they are putting too much thought into how they make music now. I don't know what it is but I don't like it. I am almost embarrassed to say I like this band now.  I hope  the next album or EP is better.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|The hero in Tangled is one shameless, immature, despicable man-whore and by the end of the story I'm still not enamoured by him. But this is how Emma Chase is brilliant, you hate him, but you still love the book itself. By the way, his status as a hero is also debatable.<br /><br />This book is seriously funny and don't attempt to read it while drinking or eating for your own safety. Told in Drew Evans' POV, we got inside his pervy mind and how immature a guy can be, no matter how successful they are in their career. The first chapter had me laughing so hard, that I knew this is going to be a gem. The story started off with Drew at the lowest point in his life, hiding in his apartment wallowing in self-pity for seven days. He is devastated that the first woman he ever love is marrying someone else. I was thinking 'poor Drew'.<br /><br />Then we were brought back to how it all happened four months ago when Drew met Kate Brooks at a bar on a Saturday night. He keeps hitting on her, but she just brushes him off and told him she's engaged. The second chapter is dedicated to show us how he is such a man-whore that by the end of the chapter, I was thinking 'serve you right, Drew'. And because I had just done watching Crazy, Stupid, Love, I'm going to imagine Ryan Gosling as Drew.<br /><br />\\"God. I may end up being the first man in history capable of masturbating without touching himself. Look, Mom--no hands.\\"<br /><br />Apparently, Kate is a new employee in his father's firm, where Drew also happened to work at. Anyway, working in the same place doesn't stop him from pursuing her. Things turned nasty when his father wants them both to fight for the same client. Finally a trait that I like in Drew, when it comes to choosing between work and woman, work prevails. He is dead set on winning the client and here starts the war. Oh my, the things that they both did to sabotage each other is totally unprofessional, but we can see how serious is Drew in his work. He can't stand to let Kate take away the limelight. Drew turned from wanting to bang her, to wanting to kill her, to wanting to bang her all over again. Kate is totally driving him crazy here.<br /><br />Since we didn't get any POV from Kate, and she just appeared to be a hot chick in his firm, albeit a very successful and intelligent one, I don't feel connected to her. She's engaged to her teenage sweetheart, Billy since she was fifteen. Wow. We can totally predict that she going to end up breaking up with Billy, but I had no idea how's that going happened. Her character is not very fleshed out. I also not sure whether Drew deserve her.<br /><br />\\"It makes me want to kiss her and strangle her at the same time. I've never been into S&M. But I'm beginning to see its benefits.\\"<br /><br />The supporting characters includes Drew's guy pals, Matthew and Steven and Drew's family, his Bitch of a sister and his totally adorable niece, MacKenzie. I never actually impressed by a four year old before, she did it. I bet she's turning millionaire with her Bad Word Jar.<br /><br />The story itself is pretty formulaic for a romantic comedy, but the difference is the presentation itself from Drew's POV. Although I still kind of hate him, but since he had me laughing so hard, I forgive him for being an ass. If I wanted to quote some lines in this book, I will be ending up quoting the entire book. Drew gives one of the most epic and over the top grovel scene that I encounter. I'm not really into PDA, so I'm not sure should a girl be touch or totally annoyed. By the way, I heard there is also an epic grovel in The Proposal by Katie Ashley. I haven't read it yet, so I'm not sure which is more over the top. Anyway, don't take this book seriously and just enjoy the humor in it.o let Kate take away the limelight.

B007FDE4Y8|1.0|Duct taping one of the weights to the front arch adjustment knob helped somewhat but overall it never fully stabilized. I spent hours testing literally every possible combination of weights, balancing the camera forward balancing it back and centering. Even when I had adjusted to a  barely usable point the knobs and lockdowns wouldn't keep it in balance the rig would constantly lose its adjustment while walking around. My camera is about 4 pounds with the lens and it doesn't work. I'm guessing if the camera was maybe 2 pounds it might work. While holding the gimbal if you use your thumb to lightly control the camera you can kind of stabilize it but it sort of defeats the purpose. I wasn't expecting perfection for the price but Opteka delivered less than I expected.

Love all three lead women characters...so smart, sassy and in control.  Great writing and great acting.

B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|Bought this assuming I'd be spending most of my time absorbing higher quality bonus material than what I had managed to accumulate over the years--I could not have been more wrong. Ripped them all,and now bouncing from the early Harry to the later work and back, while painful at first, soon revealed more polished areas in the flawed gems than I'd ever heard before--way beyond just Knnillssonn, which I put on a pedestal long ago. Found this especially true in the first few Pussy Cats cuts, but all the later discs have those old moments of genius. Good for God? Good for Harry...<br />As for the bonus tracks, Black Sails grows more beautiful with each listening; and I had never heard the Harry / Dr. John collaboration on All I Think About is You.<br />Big thanks to RCA and everyone involved in finally getting the big box out there.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|This is a great movie, but amazon, can you fix the rating so that my kids can watch it with parental controls still enabled????  It is rated G through the iTunes store and rated NR on amazon.

1475972350|5.0|Compelling story! At times, this book takes you roughly through the ringer, it shakes you, questions you and throws you against the wall. It is violent, thrilling and fast. The author has crafted a powerful murder mystery that wallows in the grit. And Larkin (the cop) is a hard, tough and fantastic character who I hope appears in many books to come! Must Read!

I'd love to read a book on their history and their lives. There is a scene in the bathtub that I still can't shake, and I could picture the \\"ocean\\" perfectly. Well worth reading.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle books and Kindle format on an Android is terrific. Purchasing and downloading books is just as effortless as using a Kindle. The Android is a better built device and a lot more versatile since you can have full use of other applications. Changing display settings is much easier. I have had 2 kindle devices in 18 months. I am pleased with the help desk support but the product falls short on reliability and quality. The Andriod although I have only been using it for a couple of weeks looks and works very well.<br /><br />Kindle books no matter how you use them are the way of the future. Paper is history. No more &#34;dogeared&#34; pages or lost places if you put the book down and your page closes. With kindle if you want something from a book that you have read and you left the book at home then don't worry. Log onto the internet with your Android and download it from your Kindle Library if you have it there or purchase a kindle copy and download it immediately. Problem solved. This device is better than a library in your pocket and much easier than a library to find what you're looking for.<br /><br />I love the variety of books that I now have access to.<br /><br />AJK

B005AKFXZW|4.0|What an original story. I truly enjoyed this book, I found it engaging and well written. Who wouldn't love a recipe of magic, love and a circus? The ending was a bit confusing and/or not resolved enough for me to give 5 stars though. Books should be enjoyable and easy to read, I found this book to be both.

159463176X|4.0|The book's opening and the first half of the book, focusing on the relationship between the two main characters whose lives intertwine with the lives of those around them, was difficult to put down.  However, as more characters are added in the second half of the book, whose stories are far less interesting, the book begins to drag and I found myself reading merely to get to the inevitable ending in which brother and sister reunite albeit sadly and tragically.  While the various characters hang together loosely with themes of dependency, love and guilt, as a reader I would have preferred to visit longer with the stories of the main protagonists.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have played a few games of this nature and find Minion Rush to be the best. It's easy to get the hang of and very addictive.  I LOVE this game (as should any true Despicable Me fan) and would recommend it to everyone who enjoys these types of games.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Bright pretty and cute. Fun an diverse with plenty of mini games. Should prove to be as good time waster!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Makes me laugh and take mind off the world around me. Love the movies and hope to see more minion in the future.
B002KVCA1O|4.0|It's the Rolling Stones.  Probably don't need to say a lot more.  Most of the songs you know by heart.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|A little disappointed that no happy ending YET! But I still enjoy Eva n Gideon. At least there still together
1439152810|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read this year. When I finished it, I had to go back and re-read the last 150 pages; I just couldn't let it go. I know I will read this one again! A great work of historical fiction!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I followed the directions for setup, did not work. Google was no help.  I will stick with my Apple TV
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I don't understand why this did so poorly at the theater, but if you like Science Fiction, this movie is pretty good
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game in my down time! So fun and I just love the minions :) me and my boyfriend have competitions and its always great
0792846443|3.0|This was a rather terrifying film. It's contents hold every writers worst nightmare - being caught by your &#34;number one fan&#34; who is obsessed with your writings. Weil the actors themselves portray the characters like they were born to, the storyline was rather dull. Same old attempt after another, trying to get out when it's obvious he can't without assistance. Though, that's just me, anyone else who is a fan of Stephen King (hopefully not the number one fan) may say differently.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|you would think they would make a kindle version for this game by now since its so popular! why isn't it here! this is so poopy! get the real game! NOW!
8866137480|5.0|I use it for work and it's great! The planner is high quality and super cute! :) I really love Moleskin!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have been playing Minecraft PE for some time and have noticed problems. First, the kindle fire version gets the update much later than IOS and android. Also, the kindle fire second generation can not host a server. It can join servers, even from other platforms, but it cannot host them. Other than that, everything else is amazing.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|I really wanted to like this book. With each chapter I was more and more certain it wasn't going to happen. It had the feel of an adult fairy tale with out a plot. I did finish it hoping it would get better.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|One of the best series to watch.  Excellent costumes and backdrop setting.  I have watched them all, and passed them along to my friends for them to enjoy as well.  Would recommend to anyone.  This was a great way to spend cold evenings last winter with a nice cup of tea.
0792846443|5.0|A movie based on a Stephen King book starring Kathy Bates.  How can you go wrong!  This is a classic thriller.  You will love it.
B000002KHF|4.0|A wonderful CD, as usual by Van Morrison. Precise and melodic. Any fan will be please to add this to the collection.
B0009A40ES|5.0|This movie  is all kinds of wonderful from the food descriptions to Justin Theroux looking impeccable to the FANTASTIC comprehension gap between Chloe Sevigny in Patrick Bateman's apartamento (at last) and what Patrick Bateman really thinks and feels about her.<br /><br />This movie is so perfect that it is a wonder that the director didn't go on to do more - this is on par with the direction and end result of Silence of the Lambs.  It's right up there and along with the popularity if not the quality of the Dark Knight, Christian Bale has picked up the baton passed by River Phoenix in tormenting Leonardo Di Caprio with feelings of runner-up status.
B000002KBD|4.0|This is a classic CD of long ago. I loved to the imaginative and cleverly arranged songs. A must have for fans. I'm glad I've got it.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This whole series was amazing. I was very much looking forward to the movie, went and saw it day 1, what a disappointment. These books are SO much better than the movie!!
B003SI9WYG|5.0|My children loved this movie and now the grand children also love it! I'm glad because its still a favorite of mine.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|This book, while great, drones on. It is especially hard to read on the Kindle because you don't feel like youre actually getting anywhere.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|love all jesse stone movies and books..tom selleck is the best .... he should make all the books into movies
B003Y5H574|3.0|I think I worked this movie up in my head because of the cast. Its not a bad movie, but not near as good as I was expecting it to be.
B000JMKNZQ|4.0|as each and every one of his books. Every word touch the finest fiber of our soul, helping us to reflect upon our inner beauty. I love Paulo Coelho. Definitely one of my favorite writers.
B008602KQI|4.0|I will admit I am looking forward to the Catching Fire movie, but I also feel a little let down, but when don't you feel a movie from book lets you down.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love playing the game but the chips aren't enough. I would play more often if they'd give more chips lol
B008KEQMDC|5.0|Im not typically a fan of comedy's, they are not my style. This movie had me rolling the whole time.
1401937519|5.0|From the outset I want to say that I read this book several months ago and shortly thereafter I lent it out to someone who had just been diagnosed with cancer. This means that I do not have the book in front of me while doing this review and I will just rely on my memory and share what were the most significant aspects of the book to the best of my recollection.<br /><br />The reason I shared what I did in the first sentence was because I feel that THE most important message in this book is one of hope. People who are diagnosed with cancer should know of cases like Anita's because if her severe, essentially terminal, cancer can be overcome then certainly there should be hope for almost everyone. In her book, \\"Dying to Be Me \\", Anita shares her personal history pre-cancer, as well as the events that transpired in the hospital as she went into a coma and finally what has transpired since her miraculous recovery.<br /><br />Although the initial chapters in the book, where Anita describes her upbringing and aspects of her culture, were not as relevant to me as they likely are for many others, I felt that these chapters did indeed provide a relevant context for the events that later occurred in her life.<br /><br />After the initial discussion of Anita's past, she goes on to share, in a very candid manner, how her body was ravaged by tumors and how the medical practitioners caring for her in the hospital eventually came to the conclusion that Anita was in the last moments of her life. Her NDE, similar to so many other reports from people who had end-of-life experiences, is one of great love and indeed this is her main message upon returning to the land of the living: life is about love.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to everyone because we are all touched in some way or another by this disease known as cancer; furthermore, as much as many people choose to ignore this fact, life is a terminal disease and I believe that Anita's story can bring  a degree of comfort almost everyone.comfort almost everyone.
B005FISC52|5.0|The only thing I hate about the 9th season is that there is no more to follow. Ive followed these guys since High School
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|This was not his best work, it felt more like a chore to finish reading it. The plot was easy to figure out and it didn't keep me attention. Definitely not getting the next book.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Not quite what I expected, but I feel this was a great ending to a great series decades in the making.
B008SAZHLQ|3.0|The writing is just ok and the storyline is just ok.  It's worth reading, but I had a hard time relating to some of the characters.  Mainly, I didn't really like Eleanor.  Her treatment of Park sometimes just didn't make sense.  But, the author made a simple story about young love fairly interesting.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is so much more intriguing than the movie. There's quite a bit that the movie changed that really effects the storyline.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I decided to read this after hearing Piper on the Moth and watching an episode of the new Netflix series. It is nothing like the show! It is heartwarming and uplifting and funny, with only hints of the dark stuff that is emphasized in the show. I suggest reading the book first!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Non stop action from the time you open the book till you turn the last page. Marcus Lutrell holds you in suspense each chapter and inspires you each page that whatever you may go through in life, it's not as hard as it could be!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Living in boulder and spending time in Leadville on a regular basis made the compelling nature of this book easy to connect with.  While I am uncertain whether or not every human is a natural born ultra runner....we are undoubtedly poorly suited to 8 hours of daily sedentary deterioration that crushes the body along with the spirit.  Needless to say, I think I will get outside for some hours today!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game. Love the lateral thinking puzzles and challenges. Please make some more levels and make them even more challenging!
B007HO392S|5.0|I really love Carrie Underwood and this CD is just great! Her songs are a good mix of fun, sad, and great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses so to love this game I think you might have to at least like horses to like this game
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I LOVE LADY A! While I still love their previous CD better than this one, it's still really great! They have a lot of really awesome songs!
B0058W74UY|5.0|I was having trouble viewing pbskids.org for my children on their tablets and so i downloaded the regular flash for andrioid, but then it would still take way too long and would be choppy and have to reload every few seconds.  I kept the other app and then downloaded this one as well.  Now the children can few videos beautifully.  Thank you.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I was really into this show for a while. It's a very different twist on the Green Arrow and not too badly done :)
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I bought this case for my kid's kindle fire. She is very responsible and knows to be very careful with her Fire but accidents happen. The kindle fire has been dropped a couple of times and this case has kept it safe.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I picked this up more on a whim than anything else, because it sounded interesting, but once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. Well-written, and an interesting adaptation of magic inspired by Chinese signature stamps. Definitely would love to read more from this universe, and specifically about these characters.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Haven't figured out how to play it yet. I play the regular card game but this isn't showing me quite what to do. (I will figure it out)
B00000DGUG|5.0|No doubt it was a daunting task in 1998 for Alanis Morissette and co-producer Glen Ballard to come up with an album to follow the hugely successful \\"Jagged Little Pill\\". But, they were equal to the job. The dazzling, dizzying variety on \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" almost makes \\"Jagged\\" seem tame. Even the album's title, which is taken from the track \\"So Pure\\", is quite challenging. The album contains a crazy quilt of styles and themes, like an exhibition by Picasso or Salvador Dali, and it goes on for almost 72 minutes.<br /><br />To my delight, several of the tracks have a grunge-hangover rock sound. These include \\"Baba\\", \\"Sympathetic Character\\", \\"I Was Hoping\\", \\"Would Not Come\\", \\"So Pure\\" and \\"Joining You\\". On the flip side, Alanis shows her skill with slower, and sometimes softer, material as well. These include \\"Thank U\\", \\"Are You Still Mad\\" (which resembles her hit  \\"Uninvited\\"), \\"That I Would Be Good\\", \\"UR\\", \\"Unsent\\", \\"Heart Of The House\\" and \\"Your Congratulations\\". And in between these two categories are tracks of which the song structure and/or the arrangements are very original, to a degree that almost defies classification. These are \\"Front Row\\", \\"The Couch\\", \\"Can't Not\\" and \\"One\\". Sometimes these categories overlap; for example, \\"I Was Hoping\\" really fits into both the grunge and the original categories.<br /><br />In her lyrics, Alanis has written mainly about relationships, psychological issues and characters she has encountered. \\"Baba\\" tells of a pseudo-guru with great influence over his disciples - \\"I've seen you smile as the students bow to kiss your feet.\\" (The fact that Alanis sings the words \\"Ave Maria\\" repeatedly at the end of this particular song is almost certainly a comment on religion.) \\"Thank U\\" is about healing, specifically her own experience after the insane success of her first album. In \\"Sympathetic Character\\", she paints a portrait of a partner too intense, too controlling and too close for comfort - \\"I was afraid of holes being punched into walls/I was afraid of your testosterone.\\" She describes him as her best friend, lover, mentor, brother, teacher, saviour, concluding \\"...and therein lay the problem.\\" \\"The Couch\\" is a very complex song about psychological analysis. In \\"I Was Hoping\\", Alanis goes into detail about a promising relationship that didn't work out, ending by saying, \\"I was hoping we could dance together/I was hoping we could be creamy together.\\" \\"Would Not Come\\" reminds us that fame, money, sex - all those things that we crave -  don't bring fulfillment. (\\"I'd be filthy rich and still it would not come. I'd have an orgasm and still it wouldn't come. I would stuff my face and still it would not come.\\") In \\"Unsent\\", brief notes are addressed to a variety of boys/men in her life, past and present, how she sees them and how they have affected her. \\"So Pure\\" indicates a happy relationship that is working: \\"I love you when you dance when you freestyle in trance/so pure such an expression. Let's discuss things in confidence. Let's solve the world's problems.\\" Some of the lyrics are hard to catch, but thank goodness the printed ones are provided with the CD.<br /><br />I find that the vocals are as good as those on \\"Jagged\\", if not better. Alanis uses her very recognizable voice in a number of ways, to the limit when appropriate, and subtly when that is enough.<br /><br />This is an album that any artist could be proud of. It more than succeeded in its task to uphold Alanis's reputation after the huge star-making pop culture phenomenon known as \\"Jagged Little Pill\\".ng punched into walls/I was afraid of your testosterone.\\" She describes him as her best friend, lover, mentor, brother, teacher, saviour, concluding \\"...and therein lay the problem.\\" \\"The Couch\\" is a very complex song about psychological analysis.

B007ZXK08C|4.0|I like books that are unpredictable, where it is difficult to figure out where the story is heading. But many authors make the mistake of writing stories that are impossible to predict. If an outcome comes as a surprise for each and every reader, then there is no satisfaction in trying to figure out where the story is heading and reading becomesutterly pointless. I like books that are predictable. Because then as the story unfolds I am able to think &#34;yes, just as I thought, but I bet most people are surprised right about here&#34;.<br /><br />This book has solved this conundrum in an elegant way. The first part of the book hints at several different possible outcomes. The reviews all say that &#34;you won't believe the plot twist that happens next&#34;, which gives me some extra satisfaction in thinking that yeah, that was one of the developments I had on my mental list of possibilities. The story is unpredictable for most people, and still predictable but not certain for some people. I like that in a book.<br /><br />However, the ending chapters seems to be a bit forced, as if the author had difficulties tying up the loose ends in a good way. And on top of that I would personally have preferred a different ending. So I will only give it a weak 4.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Tom played his part good the show was a way out show .I had to see it two more times to get it All Funny I would see it again

B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It's a very cute movie that children and adults can both enjoy. I definitely would recommend it. It's very clean movie also if that was what was holding you back.
0979019710|5.0|This is my very first review for a product so please accept my apologies if the format or structure looks lousy.<br /><br />Very happy I finally came across the \\"right\\" self help / personal development book.<br />I was buying book after book e-book after e-book looking for the one that could actually change what I wanted to change.<br /><br />It gave me the first tool I am actually using out of all the books I've previously read.<br /><br />The Miracle Morning is really changing my life. I am getting up at 5.15am everyday and it feels great. (no Joke)<br /><br />I didnt believe it when I read it but now I am living proof amongst many others that it works.<br /><br />You should definitely buy this book if you:<br />- have bought too many Personal Development books in the past --> this one is really going to help you<br />- if you don't believe that you can become a morning person --> I usually had to drag myself out of bed every day<br />- if you want to achieve greatness but haven't had the time to get started<br /><br />I am swiss so my writing might be grammatically incorrect but I think you still might understand my point.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A good game to play if you have a lot of spare time! I spent hours playing. I just want there to be more levels!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|AMAZINGLY AWESOME BEST GAME IN THE APPSTORE I CAN NOT STOP PAYING THIS GREAT GAME, AND IT WAS FREE HOW MUCH MORE CAN YOU WANT?

1442359919|4.0|Devin Jones, is a 21 year-old college kid from New Hampshire who is going through a rough time. His girl friend Wendy calls it quits so he decides he needs a change of scenery and something to keep him busy over the summer. He takes a job at a North Carolina, beach community amusement park. It's 1973 and the amusement park run down and barely surviving. No modern or fancy rides, instead it's draw tends to be the kinds of things that we've seen in the movies in years gone by. There's a boardwalk, a few rides and the types of attractions sometimes found at a county fair: a fortune teller, some sexy girls who take pictures of the visitors and then pressure them to buy a photo or take a chance etc.<br /><br />It doesn't take Devin long to get and make a few friends. He meets a few other college kids who live at the same boarding house and are also working at the amusement park. Together with Tom Kennedy and Erin Cook, the threesome find themselves becoming good friends, doing what teens do. The also find themselves focused on and unsolved murder case of a young girl that happened years earlier in the House of Horrors at Joyland. The girl may be gone but her ghost seems to alive and well. There's also Annie and ten-year old Michael, a boy with MS and is in a wheelchair, who play a significant part in the story.<br /><br />So is Joyland a horror fest, crime fiction, a murder mystery or ghost story?  Honestly, I suppose it's a little of all of these, except for the horror perhaps -- there wasn't any of that like some of King's other works. The story is narrated by Devin (Dev) some 40 years later and I think that worked well. I liked listening to the 60 year-old Dev, reflect on that impressionable summer he spent at Joyland. King did a great job on his character, and everything about being a college kids in 1973 seemed to feel right. For me, Joyland seemed like a cool coming of age story -- the 70's setting, the colorful characters etc. However, for such a short novel, by King standards, it felt like something was missing.  I listened to the audio version which was well done, read by Michael Kelly. Not perfect, but overall, a decent summer book.ing standards, it felt like something was missing.

B001NA6096|2.0|Having lived in Austria for a year, I was eager to see how its capital city would appear on the big screen. The story sounded like it could make for an enjoyable 100 minutes. Wrong on both counts. There was no chemistry between the principals; the dialogue was contrived; you could almost hear the team of scriptwriters trying to work multiple different angles into the give and take between the two strangers-who-become-lovers-overnight. While there were some effective scenes to show Europe's grandest imperial city, there weren't enough.  A waste of time. View at your own risk, but rent it from Netflix or better yet get it from your public library.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|If you're anything like my husband and I, sometimes you have to compromise on the TV shows you watch together. I like mystery/legal shows and my hubby likes sci-fi's. Eureka we've found one that is a bit of both! We're looking forward to watching them all.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Challenging, very addicting.  Love it!! Can't wait to play every day.  More lives would be great to have.  Keep it up!
0525953728|5.0|This was a gripping tale of our amazing hero's. it was hard to put this book down. I like the perspective from one of the mission leaders.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|A great read and such an uplifting story! You don't need to love cats to enjoy this book but cat lovers will probably see a little of their feline companions in Bob!
B009WUBERW|3.0|Kinda Cornball with lots of other movie references.  But, had plenty of fun action scenes.  Check reality at the door.
0425166805|5.0|This is the book that started it for me!!! I now know that history is wrong !!!!!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|The choreography and the acting are great. I keep watching again and again. I have seen some of the previous Phantoms and this is the best ever. It is young and modern. Ramin and Sierra have beautiful and strong voices and infuse a new vitality into their<br />roles. Ramin is powerful in The music of the night and the handsome makeshift of the mask makes him even more so.<br />The Point of no return is incredibly sensual and the Last Liar is very moving and you end up loving the man inside the &#34;monster&#34;.<br />The orchestra is grand.<br />I love it more than any other rendition.
B0058SNI5S|5.0|I don't generally like the look of Crocs, but I admit that I thought these were cute when my teenager took them out of the box.  She was looking for a good but fashionable walking shoe for our vacation since she lives with chronic pain.  She said that they fit well and provided a nice cushion for her feet, and she loved the way they looked.  She wore them the whole time we were on vacation and we did a lot of walking.  Her feet did not hurt once.  Now I'm tempted to get a pair.  Thumbs up to Crocs!
B002S0OBMS|5.0|Ramin and Sierra are much better singers and actors than the Australian equivalents in the movie.<br />I was scheptik about the story line, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br />At least 3 of the songs are just amazing and Under a moonless sky is the best description of a romantic encounter I have ever<br />heard.<br />Jus sorry there is no DVD
B00ADS98FC|4.0|my granddaughter recommended this movie to me. She had seen it before. Since I love choral music it just brought back great memories of being an adolescent.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Really really good book. It is so hard to close. I encourage others to read this book. Go tell your friends about it and tell them to read it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Holds a ton of stuff! Currently have my Canon 2Ti body and 3 lenses with lens hoods, deflector for pop up flash, flash, mini tripod, various camera cards, extra battery, camera book, point and shoot camera and video camera with tripod attached on the outside. Recently went camping and it was great to have everything in one bag. Great value for the price!
B009NQZVKG|4.0|I thought it was pretty well written, it has strong characters, graphic descriptions with out being over done and a good ending. Overall, worth the money.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Good actors, surprise ending.  Would recommend!  Drama will captivate viewers.  I purchased because of lead actress but movie was worth the watch even without her excellent acting.
B0002XMF5S|4.0|If, not for the record company insisting this album be called &#34;Black Sabbath....Featuring Tony Iommi&#34;, it would be the first solo album by the Riff Master! I have always loved this album, great songs, great musicians, & the Mighty Voice.....Glenn Hughes......on vocals!! The last album Glenn did before the demons drove him into rehab............but you would never know by the vocals on this album! If, this was Seventh Star by Tony Iommi, it would have been received a lot better than it was. I have never truly considered it a Black Sabbath album, but an Iommi solo album in all but name! I recommend this to anyone who loves a good hard rock album......it will not disappoint!!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I'd give it 5 stars, but it has a little bit of unnecessary nudity.  Not much really, but it kinda killed it for me.
B0044E9LW6|5.0|I kick myself for not grabbing this album immediately upon it's release every time I put it in & start rockin' it out! It sounds great, both shows are amazing, & RJD's voice is all powerful!! The 1987 show is amazing, Vinny Appice pounds the skins like he is trying to raise hell on earth, & Craig Goldy is on fire!! I saw RJD on the 1987 tour behind the &#34;Dream Evil&#34; album & this brought back memories of one of the best concerts I have ever attended!! If, you are a DIO fan, you MUST GET THIS ALBUM!!!
B002RI9SC4|5.0|I love this development within this concluding chapter of the twilight Saga. Bella's character finally seems to fit into the story and she no longer is the petulant teenage portrayed in the previous books. She has grown and improved. Love the Cullens development and ideology of family. The notion is both comforting and reassuring. The authors depiction of events and creativity is amazing. Well done  to a thrilling conclusion!

125000098X|3.0|I am so into this trilogy, but this one left me a little disappointed.  It didn't seem to have the pizzaz of the other two and I hated the way it ended.  Hopefully, the next one will revise my enthusiasm for this series.
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|There is no \\"hook\\" to this movie, nothing and no one to care about, nothing and no one to be interested in.  It is pointless and a complete waste.<br /><br />This boy billionaire (Robert Pattinson) insists on getting a hair cut even though Manhattan is gridlocked by a visit of the U.S. President, the funeral of a rapper, and demonstrations and protests by youth opposed to corporations and the wealthy.  His bodyguard tells him that there is a credible threat against his life.<br /><br />Not long into this movie I was praying that someone, anyone, would assassinate the billionaire just to put him and me out of his and my misery.<br /><br />Boy billionaire (actually he is in his 20s) does emerge now and then from his white stretch limo, but most of the time people have to come visit him in the limo.<br /><br />Some of the actors in this movie were able to deliver the stilted, stylized, overly pseudo-intellectual dialogue without appearing as a robot.  If F. Scott Fitzgerald had actually said that the rich are different from everyone else, I don't think he meant that they are as portrayed by the boy billionaire and his blonde consort.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I can't say I really enjoyed this movie. I kept drifting and doing other things while it was on. I wouldn't watch it again if it came on network TV.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|That was a great book I wish there was more to read about them!!!! I will be reading this again for sure!
B004SKJTY6|1.0|I agree with all the other comments about this - the confusion between the trailer and the actual movie.  Amazon has some \\"splaining to do\\".  Kinda disappointed overall in Amazon Prime, thus far.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works great everyday for my kindle fire.  It has done everything I needed very well.  No issues with this app
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I had heard so much about this show and wanted to see if it was worth it .I tried something new for me and bought the digital download  for my Kindle fire.I went though the season within days .I like the mix of  thriller, spy show,romance,political drama .my favorite character is definitely Carrie ,Claire Danes is amazing she goes from determined to heartbreaking to sad in seconds and convincingly you find yourself rooting for Carrie .all the other actors are excellent also.Tension builds episode after episode making you want to see what happens next .The picture quality is good and sound is also.It can be downloaded to watch without WiFi .I recommend if you like any of the genres I mentioned above.
0316216453|5.0|Top literature! Just wish I came across this book earlier. And... I'll read it again, I know. I look forward to read it again, after a few years. It's one of those books. Haunted in a way and very peculiar humour.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a great knife , It came shaving sharp & shipped fast as has always been the case with Amazon for me . I love the fact it's high carbon steel as I am biased towards that but have several SS including SOG which is SS as well .<br /><br />Although this isn't the perfect knife for doing everything & isn't very good for small chores I wouldn't be without it as it does excel at larger knife duties .

B0064X7FVE|2.0|It was much easier to read before the update. Perhaps they should have a feature where you could change the background, kinda like changing themes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the plot with each new episode. I Can't wait to see season 4!!! This is a fantastic season!
B009LQKHIO|3.0|Great story.  Loved the characters.  The misspelled words and grammatical errors are abundant and are very distracting. One paragraph seems to have a cut/paste problem. You start the paragraph and a couple lines in have to drop to the end then go back to the middle to finish.  Very frustrating.  I loved the story so I purchased the next one hoping for editing improvements since its not free.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|it was a great short read very emotional and sweet. its definitely a young adult/teen read i will recommend to my book club.

B001EBYMB2|5.0|Great Movie! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Lots of action, but lots of violence. But, all good war movies have lots of blood and guts. Right? Anyway, i loved it.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Owning this good adventure movie is so much better than the hassles and expenses of going to a local theater
B00EKITOXC|5.0|another fine example of how to deliver a crime drama in a way that doesn't 1. insult your sensibilities and two when your kid walks into the room one need not shut off or cover up things they need not to see. please keep at it. all in involved are extraordinary.<br />thank you,<br />anbgtft

B006QVRVJK|5.0|THE RINGS OF THE OLD ASH<br />By David Seaman<br /><br />They took the old ash down<br />Before it came down itself<br />Spilling secrets and wisdom onto<br />The roof that protects us from<br />Rain<br />Wind<br />Snow<br />Truth<br />Or lies<br />Or just plain old history<br />Part of which we witnessed<br />Through our own peripheral vision<br />And now all that's left of<br />A century or more<br />Is a flat table of rings<br />A witness to the truth<br />To the thousands of birds who lived within<br />And the thousand of worms who lived below<br />And me and mine<br />Who lived around<br />The many rings that came before<br />And rings that witnessed every war<br />And every song and all the love<br />The one who knew the secret of<br />The layered rings<br />Of every year<br />To touch a ring and try to guess<br />Which ring saw the building of the roof<br />That protects us from that very same tree<br />That had to go in order to protect me<br />From melting into the earth myself<br />For now at least<br />We fight but nay<br />The earth will get us anyway.<br /><br />Everyone likes to believe that he or she is more important than others in the world. By utiliziung a school yard scrape between their sons, two couples have come together to discuss the humane way to handle this; to put it to reat. the result is a scrape between four people that is far less civilized than what brought them together. The cast is steller; direction is brilliant and this set and art direction are unparallelled. The poem above describes the message fair;ly well. we all return to the eartyh and the level to which we destroy the earth varies from person to person. See my review of \\"God Of Carnage\\" for detaiul about the story and script.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|Great concept poor delivery.  The movie was interupted due to download spooling that I turned it off.  At one point, it completely went dead and I had to reorder the movie.  Was not happy with the service and I would probably stick with Netflix or On Demand video.  I price was attractive but I wouldnt recommend it.

0062255657|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane, is a story of a young boy who, as a grown man, returns to his childhood home, and recaptures a memory from his youth. Soon the reader discovers that his childhood was filled with sorrow, and dominated by a supernatural occurrence that becomes a part of his life, a part of his heart.<br /><br />With a prologue to introduce the boy as a grown man, and an epilogue to tie up the themes into a neat package, Gaiman has built a story that is as enchanting as it is emotive. The novel (which is quite short-192 pgs), is touted as Gaiman's first adult book since 2005's Anansi Boys, but I would not label it as such. It is also being called a fable and a fairytale. It is neither of those either. It is a coming of age story that can be appreciated by young adults and adults alike.<br /><br />The tale is told in first person, from the prospective of a seven-year-old boy. We never really come to know the name of this young boy, and, Gaiman seems to have done this on purpose. This literary device, I believe, allows the reader to identify with the character - to place himself or herself in the story, and thus become emotionally invested in him - and we most certainly do.<br /><br />When a lodger comes to live with his family, the boy becomes separated from his normal life, and connected to the Hempstock family. The Hempstocks live at the end of the Lane, and they are not ordinary people. They can see things, and control their surroundings in a way that ordinary people, or a young boy, would not be able to do or understand. The boy unwittingly becomes a part of their lives, and in doing so, he discovers the value of friendship and sacrifice with young Lettie Hempstock. Delightfully, willingly, we are drawn into the boy's story, and feel for him as though he was our own. We realize that he is trying to `find' himself, and one small sentence from the story highlights this theme, and it remains with me. It was near the end of the story where one of the Hempstocks says to the grown man, `You don't pass or fail at being a person, dear.' That thought is important to remember. I heartily recommend The Ocean at the End of the Lane.empstocks says to the grown man, `You don't pass or fail at being a person, dear.' That thought is important to remember.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who had doubts about their faith. This will convince them otherwise. I have recommended it to my congregation (I am a priest) and I've received numerous compliments on the recommendation. It's always interesting to see a scientifically oriented person shift gears and become spiritual. Actually, I've always believed they go together.
B0057URWSQ|5.0|I won't get into a long review, but this is probably the best legal drama I think has ever been written and produced for American TV. The story, plots, script, casting, direction, production and editing are all brilliant. Above all, just a phenomenally well cast show with great actors, most of whom I don't think I have seen before (I don't watch TV, so there's that). Even though it's a drama, it is never sappy, dull or pretentious.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I chose this rating because, even though it was written many years ago, it has timeless lessons about human nature. It tells the story of a different, simpler, harder age. Certain things never change, however. The characterizations are very real, and the people  are very believable. I enjoyed it very much, even though, on the face of it, it's not my kind of book.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|You should buy this show.  This show is the best one ever.  My aunt and I rented it and that is how I found out it was the best show ever.
0345529057|5.0|Needed to brush up on the book version. The books took a while to get to Hawaii but when they did I was very excited to start reading it.
034580404X|5.0|I literally had a hard time putting these books down.  The stories are sexy, exciting and you can hardly stop reading them since you want to know, &#34;What's going to happen next?&#34;  I felt like I really knew the characters.  E.L. James did a wonderful job of developing her characters and made them believable and sympathetic.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Romance, drama, suspense, some humor... it's a good show worth watching! We definitely recommend it and hope you enjoy it too.

B0060MYM7O|4.0|Cant give it a 5 of 5 because i have read the books and everyone knows the shows/movies are never as good.  Overall a good representation of the book.  I understand why some things have to change for a visual format but the second season strayed a little further than the first.  Hopefully they try to keep it on track a little better in the upcoming seasons.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A book about love, faith, talent, loyalty, perseverance, friendship and so much more. One of the best books I've ever read.

B00E3IZIM0|5.0|A Guillermo Del Toro Masterpiece! H.P. Lovecraft-like monsters fighting awesome giant robots in a \\"Weird Tale\\" dripping with ultra-realistic special effects like sea-water streaming off gigantic Cthulhu, a mile tall, rising up from the sunken city of R'lyeh in the South Pacific. We witness an Earth-empire-in-decay, as the human race starts to lose to the \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" inspired Creatures. World-Culture crumbles, in a realistically eerie take on this pulp adventure myth. However, in true Del Toro style, FEAR is balanced with LOVE. Guillermo goes further than any movie maker would, and gives this epic struggle \\"Heart\\"! Passion & Honor! Like a grand opera! He writes people that you care about in these mecha-titans; even fan-favorite Ron Perlman gives his pirate Hannibal Chau warmth. I got teary eyed, and, yep... I cried, when the 3rd act came! When tough guy Herc Hansen tells his hard-ass son Chuck Hansen what a tough guy.. just can't say to his son... oh damn... (snif!) A Gosh Damned good monster movie! Perhaps the BEST! Horror/Pulp fans have waited since H. P. Lovecraft's story, \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", was published in Weird Tales in 1928, to finally see his incredible creatures realisticly depicted in a film. Now, some 85 years later, movie technology has caught up with Lovecraft's imagination. Only Guillermo Del Toro could bring it to you with such fan-boy love and fine storytelling craftsmanship.It is an amazing fact that \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" was written in 1926, and it's taken until now for us to produce visual SFX that equal H.P.Lovecraft's genius. Take all that and give it to a master story telly like Guillermo Del Toro and you get back cinematic GOLD. Maybe it didn't make the $ on the 1srt week-end like some badly written, throw-away comedy with﻿ a \\"star\\" attached to it, but TIME WILL TELL. This film, \\"Pacific Rim\\", will build a cult following. It'll be cherished for years. It was made with love and passion, and it shows. The other \\"blockbuster\\" films of this year will fade, till no-one remembers them. \\"Pacific Rim\\" will be taught in film school - and \\"Pacific Rim\\" will become an icon of Film-Art in fan-conventions ...for the rest of MY life, I am sure. Viva Del Toro!of this year will fade, till no-one remembers them. \\"Pacific Rim\\" will be taught in film school - and \\"Pacific Rim\\" will become an icon of Film-Art in fan-conventions ...for the rest of MY life, I am sure. Viva Del Toro!
B008JFUO4U|3.0|Good cast and acting. Good storyline. Plenty of action and kept you on the edge of your seat but a bit long of a movie.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|The story was good and was also quite the easy read, but it wasn't what I expected and was slightly disappointed. Still one of my favorite stories as a whole, but the writing was a bit choppy for my liking.

0061537934|5.0|Both for dog lovers, dogs that can read and all of humanity.... this book has it all. I've been fortunate to have loved \\"18\\" German Shepards, a Great Dane and over 200 Pembroke Welsh Corgis that my Mother had raised with (\\"13\\" becoming Champions)...! But what makes this book so unique is that it's the true \\"circle of life\\"...told through the eyes, and mind of a dog named Enzo. I found it so intriguing and fascinating that I didn't want the story to end! It is a must read if your a dog lover or not. It will<br />open your eyes about so much of the human spirit, with an uplifting story about love, hope and loyalty in a family! A must read..!!!

B009LQKHIO|5.0|First of all; I would just like to take a moment to address some of the complaints that of the other reviewers here, have brought up in the past.<br /><br />#1- About the typo's and grammar errors....<br /><br />I didn't see any of those while reading my copy of this book. So either they weren't all that bad, or someone has gone back in and fixed those particular issues.<br /><br />#2- About the Epilogue only being a few paragraphs long......<br /><br />I just finished reading this and I could have sworn it was a lot longer than that. So to make sure I wasn't just blowing smoke up my a**, I went back to check it out. And sure enough, the epilogue WAS 7 pages long, and NOT just a few short paragraphs like the reviewer previously stated. Do I think it could have been longer? Or maybe answered a few more of our questions? Sure, but mostly because I'm a very curious person, by nature. lol! But since this is part of a series, I'm sure we'll get updates about this couple in the next book.<br /><br />#3- About the foul language & too many explicit sex scenes.......<br /><br />I saw nothing of the sort. Yes, there was a few curse words here and there, but I didn't feel like it was over the top in any way. And yes; there was a few sex scenes, but I thought those were well done, too. Believe me-- there are books out there that are extremely over the top with those two issues, and they are written by some really top notch authors. IMO- People who want to read stories without either of these two things, should probably stick to reading the Religious Romance type books. And that's not meant as a knock towards Religious Romance books, because I have read some pretty amazing stories written by those type of author's in the past, too. But like I said before, that's JMO only.<br /><br />#4- About the issue on the lack of character depth........<br /><br />I don't have a clue what these people were talking about. All I know is that they must have read something completely different,than the book I just read. This book was filled with in depth details--- on all of the character's backgrounds. We were told about the major losses all of them had endured in the past. We also learned about all the pain and suffering Megan went through-- first her father-- and then with her ex-husband. And then we were told about all challenges the whole Jordan family went through, after the loss of their father--- and when Iian lost his hearing. We also learned about how each and every one of these characters pulled together to over come all those obstacles of their past lives, in order to become the strong loving individuals they are today. So I really have to ask....what more do you want?<br /><br />#5- About the flow of the book........<br /><br />I thought it flowed quite effortlessly myself, although there was a chapter of two that moved a little slower than I would have liked. But that only only for about 2 chapters in the middle of the story. And even then, the story moved much faster than some of the books I've read in the past.<br /><br />I really hope this will clear up some of the misconceptions, at least for some of you who may be still on the fence about purchasing this book.<br /><br />And to all the other reviews out there...I am in no way saying that you are wrong. What I'm trying to say is... that maybe after this author read your reviews---she might have went back and had an editor clear up some of the problems--- she might have done a few re-writes, while she was at it, too. I know a lot of author's are doing just that, with a lot of their older books now.<br /><br />Lastly....I just want everyone to know, that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I will also be recommending it to my friends and family, without any hesitation. I was so impressed by this book (Which doesn't happen all that often, especially with the amount of books I have read just in the recent past) that I am going over to this author's page right now, to download the rest of the books in this series.

B0093QDGEO|5.0|Seth Rogan is just so funny. Every movie he makes is gold. Except for &#34;The Green Hornet.&#34; Jeez Louise. I had forgotten about that one, fortunately. Well, I suppose unfortunately, since I just remembered it. Now, I'll probably be unable to forget it for the rest of the day. Just thinking about him in that awful mask. Did he really think that was going to be a worthwhile endeavor? He plays a guy who is high 90 percent of the time in most of his movies. Which is great for those movies. But it was just too much of a jump for him to play the Hornet. I mean, maybe if the &#34;Green&#34; element was marijuana. Then it would have been right in his wheelhouse. Something like &#34;Pineapple Express.&#34; But, you know, that's Hollywood. He's got kids to feed. Probably all over the place. I have some insiders who have told me he makes at least six child support payments each month. Not sure how that hasn't gotten as much traction in the media. Seems like perfect fodder for TMZ or Perez, as terrible as that sounds.<br /><br />The Rock is also great in this movie.

B0052RDHTM|4.0|A masterful account about WW!.  I do not like battles and gore.  But KenFollett is an incredible writer weaving the story into a masterful novel.
B00AOCLWF6|1.0|Bad acting, bad effects, rediculis plot and dialogue. This was a poopidy poop turd of crap unworthy of being plopped in my toilet. I couldn't stand a minute if it but for the sake of trying it out I suffered through the worst 45 minutes of my life. I have taken dumps more rewarding then watching this show.

B000FBJAOG|4.0|I am finding it very interesting.  I didn't know what to expect when I purchased it.  I bought it because I love zombies and it got a lot of hype.  It reads like a text book which puts me off a bit. So it's not nail biting.  I do what I did when I was in school, I pick it up, read a few chapters, put it down and read something more entertaining and go back to it. it's a survival guide filled with facts about real things and how they would work to destroy zombies and to live through a zombie apocalypse if it ever came to that.
B00004T0US|5.0|I also had this album that I bought it back right after he passed away I have been  an elvis  fan since I was about  seven  I am 49 now
B004VMUS9G|5.0|the alarm mode gives multiple alarm setting, while allowing multiple date arrangements for each setting for up to a week.  The stop watch is excellent as well.  The clock runs continuously even when running lap mode which it displays the individual laps below the running watch.  Highly recommend.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and couldn't put it down.  Every person had multiple layers of deceit, envy, cravenness,  self-importance.  The character study and interplay is fascinating.  Truly the dark side of a beautiful English village.  The writing is fantastic as you might expect.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Fantastic movie, fantastic 3D ;-) I looooove it, hope for part 2 and 3 soon ...would also love to see Alien and Aliens in 3D
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This story needed more action.  Too much of the story was spent in places that are not important and it is difficult to care about.  Some of the concepts were good, but over all most of the 'interviews' were boring.  The book is very different from the movie, much less action.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Saw this movie in the Theater, and it was amazing.  As soon as it was available as a pre-order, I ordered it.<br /><br />Glad it finally arrived.  I need to stop using the free whenever it arrives it arrives shipping.<br /><br />Interesting twist on the alien invasion of earth idea, had me going with a few twist plots and questions through most of the movie.<br /><br />Visuals and specials effects are top notch.  Audio is expertly matched to the moods to help drive home the feels behind the actions.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.

B0053O89WY|5.0|The Big Bang Theory brings back the lovable and extremely quirky characters of Leonard, Penny, Sheldon and the host of others.  From a love affair with Siri to game board craziness - this season continues to amp up the hilarity.  If you need a huge laugh or just miss the funny characters - Season 5 is your answer.
B00CKYHH6O|4.0|\\"Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Fourth Season,\\" new on Blu-ray, offers deeper character development than earlier seasons, making this season one of the best.  The six-disc set contains all 26 episodes, beginning with the Season 3 cliffhanger, \\"The Best of Both Worlds (Part 2),\\" an exciting episode in which Riker (Jonathan Frakes) is promoted to Captain and commands a fleet of starships to confront the Borg. Filled with neat visual effects, rousing music, phaser fights, and outer space battles, this installment often looks more like a big-screen motion picture than a TV show.<br /><br />Other notable episodes include the \\"Manchurian Candidate\\"-inspired \\"The Mind's Eye;\\" the comedy-laced \\"Data's Day;\\" and the creepy \\"Night Terrors,\\" in which the Enterprise crew finds the missing starship Brittain and  discovers that the Brittain's crew went crazy and murdered each other. Special features include the multi-part documentary \\"Relativity: The Family Saga of Star Trek: The Next Generation,\\" gag reel, deleted scenes, archival mission logs, and audio commentaries on two episodes.
0684824906|5.0|The author did a wonderful job at hisotical research. Her writing was clear and concise. One of the best historical books I have ever read.
B005LAII4E|2.0|\\"G.I. Joe: Retaliation\\" finds the G.I. Joes successfully fighting terrorist forces around the world. Led by Duke (Channing Tatum), the team emerges from many of its battles unscathed. But the team is betrayed by the government, and Snake Eyes (Ray Park) is framed for the death of the Pakistani president.<br /><br />After an intense attack on the GI Joes, the surviving soldiers -- Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) -- must find out who has betrayed them and retaliate for the murder of their comrades. Their investigation leads them all the way up to the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce).<br /><br />Based on a series of toys, the film is more a living comic book than a feature picture, with action abounding, muscled heroes proliferating, and a streamlined plot geared to discourage too much thinking. It seems aware of its own silliness and geared to ten-year-old boys or anyone who values mayhem over plot. The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains behind-the-scenes featurettes and director and producer commentary.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|It was a little hard to follow.  Not what I expected from the previews. Its a love story with a twist.  Good movie but not the best.
0143038419|5.0|Every traveler knows that the reward is not in the destination, but in the journey. When the high point of the journey coincides with the destination, like in Eat Pray Love, the journey is even more fulfilling.<br /><br />This memoir surely attracted all kinds of readers: gourmets, spiritual seekers, romantics; what attracted me was the last part of the subtitle: \\"One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India, and Indonesia\\". The way I came to pick up this book from the shelves at Borders was the promise of travel. I love Italy and everything Italian; I always wanted to go to India (but still haven't yet); and I had just come back from a trip from Southeast Asia (not Indonesia, though).<br /><br />So I picked up the book. Now, depending on your personality and where you are in your romantic life, you may either identify with or at least understand Elizabeth Gilbert, or may be completely baffled by her dilemmas. The book starts at an emotional low point in the author's life. But if you stay with Elizabeth Gilbert through the initial chapters, I guarantee that your spirits will be lifted. And by the end of the book, Elizabeth Gilbert will become \\"Liz\\" to you.<br /><br />Things pick up when Elizabeth arrives in Italy. This is when I realized that this book is a real treat. Elizabeth's keen eye, sensibility to beauty and humor make her probably the most qualified person in the world to describe Italy. Italian men are, in the author's words, \\"beautiful in the same way as French women, which is to say - no detail spared in the quest for perfection. They're like show poodles. Sometimes they look so good I want to applaud.\\"<br /><br />Her description of the rants of an old tifoso (fan) at a soccer game had me laughing with tears. She might also be the most qualified person in the world to comment on a soccer match. I've never read any other paragraph that captured the essence of European soccer better than this one.<br /><br />The \\"Eat\\" aspect figures prominently in the Italy chapters.  Her description of the pizza experience in Naples will leave you with a smile on your face and craving for that piece of heaven that is the authentic Pizza Margherita. Again I can't resist quoting from the book: \\"I am having a relationship with this pizza, almost an affair. Meanwhile, Sofie is practically in tears over hers, she's having a metaphysical crisis about it, she's begging me, \\"Why do they even bother trying to make pizza in Stockholm? Why do we even bother eating food at all in Stockholm?\\"<br /><br />Then Elizabeth travels to an ashram in India. A necessary trip that is part of her self-discovery journey. The focus turns inward. Again, depending on your personality or where you are in your spiritual journey, this may inspire you, intrigue you, or weird you out. I hope it won't weird you out; but if it does, please hang in there. The rewards are around the corner.  This middle part of the book is necessary to give the author the self-confidence and strength to face her own fears and accept the heavenly gift that comes unexpectedly in Indonesia.<br /><br />Indonesia (and more specifically, Bali) is as delicious as Italy, but more exotic. The author's spiritual experience begun in India flourishes in Bali. In Bali, she does not need to become spiritual. She just is. And when she stops worrying about her spirituality, that's when the spiritual force comes naturally. And true love. The fact that this is a true story makes this turn of events exhilarating - by the end of this book, you too will want Liz to find true love.<br /><br />All in all, Eat Pray Love is a magnificent book. A book that becomes one of your favorites as soon as you finish it, and one that will find a permanent place in your library, somewhere at eye-level and within easy reach.<br /><br />Grazie, Liz, for the wonderful treat!the Italy chapters.

B001QOGYBI|5.0|This movie is hard to explain.  It's so interesting and hilarious, I just cant get enough.  I bought it for my son, but my husband and I love it just as much as him, maybe more!
B009WUBERW|5.0|This movie was impressive!<br />It starts with heavy action from the beginning all the way to the end, and the quality production values showcase in the whole movie... J.C. Van Damme performance is top-notch and the whole crew is just amazing doing what they know best, action movies !
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Love the game but I don't know what is wrong with the free version  the game froze up so I Reinstalled it so LISTEN TO ME
B00COHAUD4|3.0|More like \\"Mehma.\\" But seriously, I like the story and it had creepy potential, but the special effects kind of ruined it for me. It would've been creepier if Mama was just an actual person in costume instead of this fake looking CGI crap. Jamie Lannister is in it and he is very handsome.
0425263916|5.0|Book 2 in the Crossfire series. I loved the continued the story of my new favorite couple.  Cannot wait to read book 3!!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I wish I would have got this sooner but bought it to take on my vacation.  I didn't have to worry about storing the bluetooth in the suitcase in the charging case.  You get two charges for the bluetooth from the charging case before it needs to be recharged and stores and keeps the bluetooth safe.  Small enough to slip into your purse or similar.  Well worth the price.
0425263908|5.0|I got started on this book because I heard it was similar to Fifty Shades of Grey.  This book is TONS better. Loved the story line, the romance and the yummy scenes.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Thanks So Much For The Great Cd I've probably listened to it well over 20 times and it's very nice!!!!  I was very Happy at how quick the delivery was!!!!  Again Thanks It was nice doing business with you!!!
0316044695|5.0|A real gut wrencher.  First half is his progression through the SEAL program.  Second half is the attack itself.  Hard to read cause you have to stop to cry occasionally.  My son is home now and I am greatful to him, Marcus, and all the others that sacrifice for us.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|the game glitches and took all of my skills away and then I started a new character and it deleted it and it was lvl 18
8866135771|5.0|My wife has never switched her daily calendar/planner to a smart phone - she likes the \\"extra space\\" that is available by recording in a book - these planners are very well organized with extra pages for notes - one of the advantages for her is recording our children's daily activities and other family memories that becomes a history book - we hope these planners continue to be printed each year
B005MMY9A8|3.0|I would actually give it about 3.5 stars.  It's a decent superhero movie, nothing spectacular but good enough.  Enjoyed it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I could not put this down. I was so completely drawn into Victoria' story- I am still thinking about it after completely the book several days ago! I found that the author's structure of the book, of going back and forth from past to present, kept me riveted to the story. I loved learning about the meaning of different flowers too,
B0006GAOBI|5.0|DVD came on time! got this as a gift for someone whos a big fan of the movie and they liked it
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Looking forward to watching season 9 !! Can no wait ! Only wish that amazon had ready to purchase.  Do not understand why the delay. Would think that next day would be ok
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I really like the weight and lack-of-bulkyness of this case.  The stuff about this case that is less than perfect it the flip cover.  It doesn't really do a great job of acting as a stand, and maybe could be a little more rigid.<br /><br />I would buy it again, and recommend it to others.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game is great for just matching or go further and build the Tree of Life world. I've. really enjoyed it.
0316017930|4.0|My daughter likes the book better than she thought she would, but it is a slower read than she is used to and there are a lot of ideas and concepts to &#34;digest&#34;.  Her father and I plan to read it as we like Malcom Gladwell and have one of his other books as well.
B008JFUO36|1.0|Who wrote that Editorial review? It has to  be a Cruse relative...<br /><br />This movie is a mess. I got lost, no the movie was so pointless that halfway through I gave up trying to find some thread of redeeming social value.<br /><br />Then the movie tried to make itself interesting, still with no decent plot line and then they tried to inject a plot line and then they raced to make the injected plot line relavent and then at the end they raced to patch together an ending and to be quite honest I never understood what the heck was going on at the end and I'm an educated person. This movie was very beautiful most of the time, but the producers spent so much time making it pretty that someone forgot they needed to tell a cogent story. This movie is a mess... I might buy it when it gets to $.01 for the beauty of the first half after that, forget it.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|So much fun to watch, l love it has such a happy ending. Great fun syfi. fun. Wish my 13 year old can watch but not yet.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|while reading this book, I found it harder and harder to put down. Should read the 1st book before reading this one. Glad someone gave the characters a lot f different characteristics!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|great price, great show, cant wait to get the last season!  I would highly recommend this show to anyone who likes gritty drama.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|You can tell it's going to a crazy, FUN!, ride. I had it in my head that I didn't like Michael Chiklis since I was in high school, and am now ashamed of quickly dismissing such a terrific actor. Of course, who could forget Walton Goggins. If anyone is every ballsy enough to bring the graphic novel &#34;Preacher&#34; to the big or little screen, I hope Walton gets the lead job. Back to The Shield-- morally gray is one of my favorite tv tropes. This show has plenty of that. See for yourself.
B00785P2QC|5.0|really fun for the family fun and friends we love at least give it a try.you get to actually run your whole city it is awsone
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is easy and fun and totally appropriate for young ages I could use this to. Cheer up when I'm feeling down. Share this game with all your friends I bet they wouldn't turn it down
B008JFUUIA|3.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend, and the condition was perfect and all. I'm just not a fan of the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is the best game and its very addictive with 2 click you can play i would reccomend to all aged people and i hope you have lots of fun i know i am  have fun and enjoy the game
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn can write!  Besides a terrific and well-paced plot, she has an amazing knack for creating certain apt descriptions in simply two or three words, sometimes a made-up phrase, that others might spend a paragraph or two on;  these gems not only carry a certain flavor of recognition, but often reveal and essence that reeks of some before-hidden truth.  Thoroughly enjoyed this guilty summer pleasure...
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|This movie is now one of my favorites!  This is  great movie and I recomend it for everybody. I didn't really know what to expect of it, all of my friends reall love this movie so i bought it. It also arrive the day before it was suppose to.
B003N7GATM|4.0|I'm going to be honest, I hated this cd when I first heard it. I actually had a free download, but deleted it because I thought it was garbage. Okay, I didn't think it was garbage, it just wasn't what I wanted to hear from Trent Reznor. Sometime later, I heard a song from the band and really liked it. I didn't realize who it was by until later, and was shocked when I found out because of how I felt upon first listening to the band.<br /><br />So, all in all, a good cd and band.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Schwarzenegger big syfy action hits, lots special effects and nonstop action makes this movie exciting to watch. It's a good weekend of Friday night action movie.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I truly love this movie as do others of my circle of friends.  Give it a try. I believe it is a fine movie!
B001TW68P4|5.0|Good classic music to listen too.  They don't make music like this anymore.  I even have our teenager listening to it.
B009CG29RK|5.0|What a great movie!  Didn't really look into it prior to recently, but it is a wonderful movie and quite enjoyed it!
B00A285OOW|5.0|Like all of Philippa Gregory's novels -- a great read.  Learn 15th century English history from the woman's point of view.  Well written and riveting - always - from the first to the last page.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|In brief: I asked the fp for a new phone and a day later my wife says to me(while out shopping)\\"One time offer do you want this or not it was the latest Samsung. Well of course I said yes.Next time I'll ask for an IPhone :)
1781162646|5.0|I understand Stephen King's support and love of crime noir --- hence the dedication to Donald Westlake at the front of the book --- but the biggest mystery here is why this terrific, literary novel is included in the hard case crime series.<br /><br />Yes --- there is a killer lurking around the small North Carolina amusement park known as Joyland --- and he has been killing for over a decade.  However, the role he plays in this novel is fairly insignificant and, quite frankly, a bit of a distraction to a beautifully written tale of redemption, hope and a bit of supernatural magic.  Sounds a lot like GREEN MILE and SHAWSHANK and for good reason --- it's nearly as good as those stories.<br /><br />Set in the summer of '73, 21-year-old Devin Jones is literally coming of age with what starts out as a summer job at Joyland (the place that sells 'fun'!).  The lessons he learns, bonds he makes and lives he saves are more than enough to fill up the pages of any novel.  Trust me, you'll be aching for more of Mr. Jones.  The role he plays in finally uncovering the Joyland killer is somewhat suspenseful and probably the only reason this novel was able to get released under the Hard Case Crime series.<br /><br />Once again, Mr. King shows he is much more than a mere horror writer.
B00D3LA71K|4.0|Movie keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting on the next plot. The endgame was great and uexpected
B0000069CT|5.0|As always, Masur does very nice work on Bruch with the Gewandhaus, and Accardo is his usual very good soloist.  Both soloist and orchestra give well-conceived performances that respect the music fully yet let its inherent beauty soar, particularly Bruch's unsurpassed melodic lines.  Accardo takes perhaps a more reserved and dignified line than younger virtuousi who perhaps too often make these showpieces for themselves at some expense of the music.<br /><br />Sound on the Philips recording in is very good, also as usual.  These are late 1970's vintage recordings and Philips always managed to have good balance, hall sound, clarity, etc., but were never quite state of the art, even for their era.  I'd guess these were analog recordings based on their year, but analog recording can sound better than this, including from earlier eras.  The sound is very good, but not great.<br /><br />The soloist is definitely spot miked, which results in clearer instrument sound but puts him in a different sonic space far in front of the orchestra, and also makes his instrument sound too large and way out of scale to the rest of the company.  This is unfortunately endemic in most concerto recordings.<br /><br />Bruch's second and third concerti have pretty moments and nice melodies but are arguably rightly less famous than his first and the Scottish Fantasy.  For me the real gems are the much less performed and recorded concerto-length concertante such as the Opus 75 Serenade here, and various superlatively beautiful romances which this same group of players have recorded on other collections for Philips.  Those romances, other concertante such as his Adagio appassionato, In Memoriam, Konzertstueck, and this Serenade are every bit as good as his best known works.  Seek them out and see if you agree.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|great vampire film with a different surprise twist. Chloe Grace Moretz pulls you in and make you love her forever.
B003UESJHO|5.0|This movie is amazing, the acting is incredible and based on a true story. I would highly reccommend this movie!! And the pricing is very inexpensive compared to the big box stores. Product came on time and without any damage!
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|If you are looking to not use your brain then this is the book for you. I like this type of book after I read something heavy.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I love this movie! I bought it for myself to add to my movie collection, this is such a classic movie that will never get old. Also, Steve Carell is amazing! Great comedy with lots of twists!
B002VECM72|5.0|Heard a lot of good things about this movie.  Have a Sony 46 inch and a Sony blue ray. Excellent combination.

B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Good game  keep time when you play and give you a hint and directon.  I recommend to all people and down load
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love the timeline the script follows. Excellent choice of actors protraying their respective roles. PBS has a winner with this series.
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a great writer and this book is one more great novel. I had a lot of fun with it and it is a great book for Who likes Fiction and Fantasy.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Great action and comedy. Script was done well for an action movie. Definitely recommend. Looking forward to the next one.
B000002AHM|5.0|This is an absolutely FANTASTIC album!  My only complaint is that the last track ends abruptly, and the silence that follows (versus the live audience's clapping and hooted appreciation) is grossly anticlimactic. Couldn't the engineers have made a different decision on how to end a CD as good as this?  One wonders.<br /><br />Don't let that stop you, though. Get it, and get it now. Stuff like this goes in and out of print for the strangest reasons.
B008JEJO88|5.0|I LOVE MY CROCS!!!  Size 12 6E foot bought these crocs in size M 11 fit PERFECTLY1!  Walking on hard surfaces wearing these is a dream.

B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|I know this is a throw-away game developed as a tie-in for the movie.<br /><br />I know it was free.<br /><br />I know it was pretty damn boring and was a conduit for me to spend money without any benefit or satisfaction for myself.<br /><br />You fly in a suit, you tilt to avoid obstacles, you tilt to capture power-ups.  It's tired and plays like every other mid 1990's race combat game.<br /><br />so, I did not care for the game and it did not keep my attentions and if I want to put myself in a position where I am spending money to entertain myself when no one is watching, hell, I'll get married again.<br /><br />But I'm not bitter.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Tedious, but my 3 year old loves it. And it can kinda teach him more about infrastructure so it's not all bad.
0762449314|4.0|Here's something Dr. Who fans will get a kick out of - an exceptionally small and fantastically detailed Dalek figurine. It comes with a simple mini-booklet about the history of the Daleks, as well as an incredibly detailed and articulated plastic figure. This is one of the better quality Mega Minis I've seen as far as looks go, as many of these things often look pretty cheap once they are out of the box.<br /><br />The Dalek's \\"arms\\" and eyestalk, however, are made out of very thin plastic. I'm concerned that they are not going to survive any but the gentlest handling. Despite its tiny size and wheels, the Dalek is definitely not a toy for younger kids.
B00DI5DPE2|4.0|Bob Ludwig (Gateway Mastering & DVD) failed to impress me with Sultans Of Swing; too weak vocals. I'm not sure why Mobile Fidelity claims from \\"master tapes\\", since the multi-tracks are available for genuine remixing-remastering, even with the actual, unpublished song ending! Sadly, with audio CDs, there's no money-back guarantee that you'll be pleased with the sound quality.
B001FA0W5W|4.0|Mr. Taleb makes it clear that success in ones life driven by luck but mistakenly thought to be the product of his own intelligence can lead to a real train wreck. He can at times be wordy but he uses them very well. He has the ability to  make some very complicated facts of life very easy to understand.
B000091OLX|5.0|One of the most underrated bands. Awesome vocals and the music is killer if you like 80's hard rock. This is a keeper!
B0035JNRXU|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan but not enough to be called a trakkie.  I have always love the chemistry between Diane and the commander so I love the last two movies where their love comes true!
B00AQO1VYY|4.0|Mad Season's first and only studio album, Above, pieces together a potential dream team of Alice in Chains frontman Layne Staley and Pearl Jam axe-slinger Mike McCready. If you're hoping to hear a record filled with angst and rage that surpasses both of these bands in the Ten/Dirt era, you'll be sorely disappointed. The music of this album is a result of a combination of rehab (where McCready met Seattle-area bassist John Baker Saunders), writing some music without a vocalist (after linking up with Screaming Trees drummer Barrett Martin), improvising a show without even having a name for their band, and the hopes that Layne could get sober by being around sober musicians.<br /><br />Although those are facts, my interpretation of the album is entirely theoretical. Listening to the music and tying it in with the lyrics, parts of it definitely feel like a reflection on a stint in rehab (coincidence? I think not). \\"Wake Up\\" makes me picture someone coming to their senses with a raging hangover on a rehab bed, not knowing where they are. The somewhat gentle-sounding narrative Staley creates almost sounds like a doctor speaking to their patient. The songs that follow directly after, \\"X-Ray Mind\\" and the smash hit \\"River of Deceit,\\" sound more like the patient's narration. Other songs, such as \\"Long Gone Day\\" and \\"All Alone\\" follow in this vain.<br /><br />As far as the music itself, it creates a very somber and introspective mood. The songs are not as energetic, let alone heavy, as Alice in Chains or Pearl Jam's best known work; even a heavier, lumbering AIC style number like \\"Lifeless Dead\\" feels a bit reserved. However, the chemistry between the members and their desire to rid themselves of their own personal demons is evident to me throughout this record.<br /><br />This album won't stand the test of time with the greatest music to come out of Seattle, but it is an interesting footnote in the scene's history.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The movie is well done. The special effects are awesome. I will watch it again especially when we have company over to enjoy the 3D.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Written in dogs point of view and really touching book. I highly recommend this book, easy reading, touching as well.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Friends was one of the most entertaining shows on TV for me. It was my alternate reality. I knew all the cast, as if I was a next door neighbor. And not a fat, naked one. I highly recommend this pack.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What else can be said about Serenity? It's a great movie. One who is not a follower of the series \\"Firefly\\" can jump right in to \\"Serenity\\" and not skip a beat.
B007SGLZH6|5.0|His approach made sense to me - weight rather than volume.  Having made two different loafs in the last two weeks - each came out right first time.  At least one of Ken Forkish's recipes is likely to be produced in my house each week.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun game. Escaping from the rooms (ten of them) was not too easy nor too difficult. I look forward to the additional rooms that the producer has promised.
B00000DO39|5.0|Von Karajan did some great recordings with the Philharmonia, and this is one of them.  The playing is magnificent, and the recording sounds as if it were only a few years old, although there is a bit of ADD hiss.<br /><br />These are the large orchestra versions of the overtures - not the smaller ensemble type that has become so common now.  The various sections of the orchestra and soloists just shine here. Von Karajan was an opera master - and although he looked so serious most of the time, he had a flair for operatic humor.  This really comes through and one cant help but listen to the sunny Italian sound and laughter of these very funny operas coming through.<br /><br />Really recommend this disc.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if your son or daughter wants to download this app it is worth it. It is used to show creative thought through blocks. there are no rules to this game. you can do anything in this game. this does not require wifi but will for any necessary updates to the game. its awesome. you can also play with friends.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|App worked well with great user interface until last night. Now it crashes right after launching. I have uninstalled and reinstalled twice but it still crashes.
6305433909|5.0|This movie is a classic! Its very funny and a childhood favorite of mine. I only wish it was longer!
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|I adored the stage show, and saw it performed live multiple times, as well as cherishing the taped Tenth Anniversary program. I know the libretto by heart.<br /><br />I looked forward to the film, but, I was stunned by how awful it was. I can't believe it was up for &#34;Best Picture&#34; at the Oscars. What kind of insanity is going on with great operettas like Les Miserables and  Tim Burton's &#34;Sweeney Todd&#34; brought to the cinema?<br /><br />Don't show tunes need to be sung by actual singers? While Anne Hathaway certainly had a great performance, Hugh Jackman and Russel Crowe were like seeing an amateur production version of the show, not, a disaster.<br /><br />Even though they used actors, who had limited vocal range, couldn't they sweeten the songs with overdubbing or any of the multitude of tricks that would help improve the quality of the singing?<br /><br />The purpose of Les Miserables, the musical, was the M U S I C!!! It was almost like a sick joke to expect people who love musical theater to automatically assume the show would be replicated in sound, and then, be confronted with a dismal film with no musical depth.<br /><br />Eddie Redmayne and Seigfried were just passable, but, considering some of the most beautiful songs were between Cosette and Marius, their vocals were worse than a High School production, with untrained teenagers, and their wildly uncontrolled tremolos. My ears were bleeding.<br /><br />I bought this DVD hoping it would be good, but, it was horrible. I'd give it no stars if I could. This was a big joke on the world, who bought into it. I would like my money back.
B00CHILW64|4.0|Special effects created reality for the viewer on this recap of the Thailand sunami.  It shows how an experience like this totally changes people and how in the flash of an instant, our lives change.  Really good acting by all.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Because it works great!!  I like it because its white and easier to find and I know it is for my kindle!!  would be nice if they were marked because we now have so many cords !!
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|I rented this one for the Kids one Saturday.  I need some peace so I could work on a computer project.  Much to my dismay, I got into this one two.  Everyone knows this story.  But the acting and effects take it to a whole new place.  I bought it, so the kids can watch it a few more times on the Ipad.  I still haven't gotten that project done.  One word of caution.  The effects are pretty good, so it might not be a good movie for really little kids.  Those giants are a bit scary.
0064404994|4.0|Really amazing book, although for once, I liked the movie adaption more simply because of more action. It's also my favorite of the 7 Narnia books.
B0081SKYDG|1.0|Pretty weak attempt at coming of age movie.  Supposed to have the look and feel of a reality TV.  Much better movies out there.
0375826742|5.0|Whoop! Whoop! The consciousness of my mind was literally pulled into this book as I eagerly awaited what would happen next. I am restless thinking about the final book and the conclusion to this series.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I was hesitant when I saw the ads for this one.  I am glad I rented it.  I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, I think he is overrated.  But this is a bit of a different role for him.  Morgan Freeman is always good.  Great space action movie.  Great twists and turns, not as predictible as I thought it  might be.  Worth the rent, or buy.
1423140605|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, way more than all the other Percy Jackson books. Sure, things were different, with the main characters from both the Roman and Greek camp being together. But the constant action that you never thought you'd see in a Percy Jackson book was amazing. I wasn't too pleased with the cliff hanger, but Rick Riordan sure did do a splendid job at it! I can't wait for the last two books in this series and can't wait to see what Riordan has up his sleeve next!
B00BB8PWSK|3.0|I liked this one because it was a bit different than what you would expect from an allien movie.  It is pretty family friendly, but there is some language in that may offend some.  Pretty good story.  Good rental, all and all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love this game. It is challenging and fun. Some of the puzzles take me a very long time to finish.
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|Got to be in the right mood for this one.  Great story it isn't, Great action, well sort of.  Great acting, kind of.  It is just a fun movie to watch after the kids go to bed.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I have read all of the Theodore Boone books. Enjoyed all of them. Great adventure series for adults and kids. Looking forward to the next installment in the series.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|We enjoyed the movie for the story line and the special effects.  Tom Cruise, for all the negativity he seems to be acquiring, did a good job in this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and its an entertaining game for me to play. The only problem is the waiting but other than that, it's fine.
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|excellent product as described on this page, highly recommended, serious, fast if the occasion volvere to buy with you, all in excellent condition
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game. I have played on many devices and really like it on my kindle. I would buy this game again.
B000SX9IXO|5.0|One of the best albums of all time. Such a unique sound with the soulful voice of Levon Helm and guitar of Robbie Robertson.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I loved it some much that it is in my favorites and it is the only thing in there so far. : )
B001FB5634|2.0|I found it hard to follow and not a really easy plot to follow. it did make a person think what could be if the bomb did hit.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|it's a good game to play every now and thenit has really cool suits and the graphics are sweet if you like Iron Man and Temple Run check it out only one mission a day
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|season two of suits was extremely enjoyable to watch without the aggravation of commercials losing the plot while jabbering about some off the wall garbage. each show was extremely good to watch.
B00BMCLCG6|3.0|Music is on the slower side but all in all its got some good tracks. Download was easy and fast.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I thought the movie was enjoyable. It was interesting to see just how far ahead of his time Lincoln actually was in his day.
0385751532|5.0|This book was required reading for my son. We got the book and he has already read it for school this fal. He said that he enjoyed the book and learned a lot.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Best book ever it was amazed it was a lot of action . The ending was cute .<br />Happy book
0307352153|5.0|It came quickly.  The book is personally very helpful at this point in my life.  It's helping me understand how I've been created.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun game easy to get into and fun to play, so far so good. No complainants here
B008VSEJPK|5.0|Love this book. Many good examples and tips on how improve your mixing. I really think that mine took a leap step forward to mich more commersial sound.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok so i had no idea about minecraft before last year. My friend Eliza told me about it. She said how much fun it was and that it would become addicting. well two months ago i went to some minecraft con or something like that and i found out how much fun it really was. I finally got a kindle for my birthday, and the first app i got was minecraft. This really is the best survival/creative app out there. Your money will be well spent! My name is Kristenkittty by the way.don't forget the three t's. Its not two.everybody messes that up.<br /><br />But yeah for seven bucks is totally worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :33
B00821OX98|5.0|I think falling skies is one of the greatest shows, so all the seasons would be worth watching, I give it a ten
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|For a non-reader, I find this book interesting enough for me to read from one page to another. This is the kind of book I've been looking for so long.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Wish it would let you have more health potions. Overall I love  it. One of the best apps I've played in a lone time.
B00CM9JIZ0|5.0|This is a fantastic coming back to form CD. Out goes Tate and in comes Latorre like a bat out of hell to not only fill the roll of vocalist but to makes us forget very quickly who the vocalist was before him. All the song are great on this CD at 35 minutes you get kicked in the balls. Each song hits you in a different way. They have come back to there roots and do it spectacularly. This should be CD of the year!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|very fiun and entertaining. gives me the down time I need after my almost 2 year old twins go to bed at night.
0062086529|5.0|One of the great books of childhood.  So good I bought it twice for one of my grandchildren.  Would love to see it in ebooks.
B0001CNRS4|5.0|my son loved it so if he was happy everyone is happy as far as I know of service was good
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I've purchase three of these lanterns previously & plan on purchasing more to give as gifts to relatives. These lanters are a must have for any emergency. Works just as well if not better than higher priced lanterns.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I just got the kindle app for my new phone which is a SAMSUNG galaxy s4. The app on my old phone was better.  Its now hard to tell if someone is talking and if its past tense or present. On my kindle when  the words would be italicized if it were past tense.
1118232658|4.0|This is a great resource to have if you are interested in social media and how to use it for your personal or business life.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Can't go a day without playing.  Could play ceaselessly I think sometimes.  Not sure scoring is fairly calculated so for very serious competitors may be angered in Bandito mode.  I usually/always play in Desperado mode; way better and way more fun.  More competitive, too.  Better after a few games of Beer Pong or any other fun activity.  Can't get enough.  Thank you Geico!  Wouldn't have found Fruit Ninja without your hilarious pig.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A must read for video game nerds. The setting and characters are believably composed. The real world tie ins bring even more reality to this bit of fiction.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|sometimes it doesn't communicate with my printer and becomes a pain in the rear but overall it's not a bad app.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|my son tried to download several times. I did have to assist him because it had a few more security questions than a normal downloading of apps. I would recommend this to everyone
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Unputdownable. The twists and turns. Thw thought that there but for the grace of god go I. We are so vunerable through our children.
B009TH2ENG|4.0|I eagerly read all of the Fables trades.  I would insist you read most of the standalones.  This one was a fun read and I have no regrets reading it, but if you're a fan who needs to save money, skip it.  It won't enhance any of the main story, it'll just be a fun diversion from it.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|This is a fun album, but is it cliché to say that I prefer their earlier work?  ;)  Still worth a listen.
B00B44XVZC|5.0|I keep expecting Fables to run out of gas, in fact I was a little worried during the Mr. Dark arc.  This story really turned it around for me though.  I kept expecting a certain ending and the book deviated from it in a good twist.  It keeps you guessing and does a good job toying with your emotions.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It's not really about the zombies.  This is a great book that chronicles the experiences of everyday people during and after the Zombie war.  Some only last a page or two and others are more in depth.  The stories evoke human nature at it's best and at it's worst.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I don't care how long ago this film was made it's a must watch. My parents and grandparents worked as sharecroppers in America.
B008Y73940|4.0|I think this character would be a great series.  Come on, produce it someone!  McConaughey portrayal is believable and the plot pulls you in.  Worth the time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like having Kindle on my phone.  Then I have a book to read no matter where I am.  Thanks it's been great using it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Because it's awesome. The characters are so sharp and witty, finally a show to fill my house void, keep it up!
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Remember the first time you saw Jurassic Park? When the T-Rex appeared in the rain for the first time? That amazing sensation of seeing the impossible becoming alive was overwhelming. You will feel the same way watching Pacific Rim. This movie captures you in its world and only gives you back after the credits.<br /><br />Everything feels real, be it the Kaijus, gigantic monsters hell bent in exterminating humanity, or the Jaegers, giant robots created to fight the monsters when everything else fails and nuking the planet repeatedly would only speed the monsters' job.<br /><br />You can feel how their heavy mass reacts with the environment while they move, the destruction the Kaiju causes in their wake and the ocean reacting to Jaeger's movement. The battles between monsters and machines are perfect.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything I can say that the entire movie is very entertaining, including the parts without fights, as the characters are likable and believable. Idris Alba and Rinko Kikuchi are amazing in this movie. My only criticism is that the movie doesn't focus enough in the awesome Russian and Chinese teams but they steal the scene in the few ones they appear.<br /><br />By the way, as I write this the movie is still in theaters so do yourself a favor and go watch it in 3D or, better yet, in an IMAX theater. You can thank me later.
B001XVD21Y|5.0|This is star packed its a must see! if you like goodfellas you will love this movie get it now!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Been using the Body Media tracker for years (the Body Bugg) before that...and they were great products, but Withings has taken the technology to a new and welcome level.  The ease of use is awesome, it connects with your smartphone and the apps that take your raw data and summarize it beautifully. The comfort of wearing it is by far the nicest difference between the earlier mentioned products and this new advance. Lastly the size is just right (so small and light) and yet large enough for the touch screen to be effective.<br /><br />Great job Withings.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Works great,  and really helped with downloaded files or documents. I would highly recommend to anyone needing this reader. Done
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series! I can't wait to read it again as the movies come out! I also enjoyed the movies, but reading the books are definitely better!
B00DF0POXA|2.0|Really not that great. Some decent lines but overall very immature and lack luster. Also it's really vulgar and many of the lyrics don't make sense. He sang quite a bit which was sorta a good change, except Kanye can't sing worth shit. Seriously don&#34;t buy this album. Plus Kanye is king doucher. His song &#34;I am a god&#34; was numerous and huberious if you know what I meant ahahaha
B000062XGD|4.0|My Dad is in assisted living and spends most of his free time watching DVDs.  Together we have watched Cast Away at least 10 times.  Every time we watch the movie we spot different little details that make it more interesting.  He watches very closely to spot something new each time.  I think this particular movie has kept his mind a little sharper this last few months.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Awesome ebook ! Very funny! It was so well written, I could picture the story scenes in my mind !
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This game is GREAT!  But the permissions are way to intrusive.<br />You get the adventurous,  storybook feeling,  without having to wonder around lost.  But,  the only bad part... Yet challenging part,  is the time limit on chapters.  As the chapters get harder and longer,  the time limits do not.  So you have to do them all over again.  Luckily,  some details  hang randomly so it's not so repetitious.  Otherwise,  I highly recommend this!!
B008602KQI|2.0|The movie was great, but the movie could not play half way through due to an amazon error. Ruined my night
B007THA4FI|5.0|The death of an individual sends ripples throughout a small town. Superbly written, excellent character development - the story and writing should qualify it for classic status.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome but it needs some more action all you do is run from side to side please work on more action..
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best Game EVER but the PC version does have more but really expensive but awesome for mobile. Only one thing...My friends already have 7.3 but i still have 7.1... REALLY DISAPPOINTED AND MAD but two words...MINECRAFT FOREVER!!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|has just the right combo of hidden object games, puzzles &amp; problem solving.  I really enjoy it &amp; recommend it to anyone looking for a good challenge.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So  easy to catch up on or review episodes I missed.  And the  overall quality of the video was excellent.
0767817648|4.0|It is difficult to provide an objective review when you just like something. This movie takes me back to the summer of 83 and it is nice to have a market place like Amazon.com to find this type of thing. Don't expect a great movie, but it is entertaining.<br />Thomas P Cosgrove DMD<br />[...]
1452126607|5.0|I will enjoy looking at her monthly memes.  It's not even 2014 yet but I can't wait to hang it by my desk.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Spent lots of time in Southport and it was fun to see some of the familiar buildings.  The story was full of intrigue and romance but somewhat predictable.  I loved it.
1452126577|5.0|She makes me smile. I just may have to buy a few more to give away as gifts. Thanks Pokey and Tard.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|this was just as advertised!!  loved Columbo when he was on tv originally and really enjoyed the series.....  the whole collection was just fine, with no dvd glitches that I read about in some of the other reviews.....  if you liked Peter Falk when these were on tv, you'll love this collection.....  the price was right and well worth every penny.....  enjoy!!!
1419705644|5.0|I love this book so much. Yeah as other people said it includes something that was mentioned in the series. But it is extremely well made and it looks awesome! Cute pictures and interesting content make it even more worth the price. If you wanna look for new information this might not be a good choice but since I am a new fan of Adventure time, I am happy with what I got from this book. Love it!
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|I am buying this and plan to rewatch it several times. I thought the acting was terrific, particularly Alexis Denisof, Amy Acker, Nathan Fillion and Reed Diamond. Many excellent supporting actors and actresses too. The modern spin was clever and surprising. Also, there was some beautiful music during the movie, written and produced by Whedon and family, using Shakespeare verses. There is definitely something magical about Whedon's directing abilities!
B005544TRQ|5.0|My roommate got me hooked on this!  Totally addicting and great dialogue between characters.  I'm already on season 2 because I can't stop myself from watching just one more episode.
B0058WFO06|2.0|I know a lot of people love this album, but wow, it was not my cup of tea at all.  I really enjoyed Steven Wilson's previous album Insurgentes, and I guess I wasn't prepared for an album that was so experimental and inaccessible.  You won't hear any straightforward rock songs like the ones on Insurgentes here; to me, this is background music at best.
B005LAII80|5.0|The 3D in this film should have been listed in the end credits near the top as one of the main characters/cast.  The 3D was used artfully and helped describe the affect of drug use and abuse.  It also helped convince audience of the enormity of the future mega-blocks.  This was a great action movie that I just did not trust to go see in the theaters.  It was only after seeing a few fans camped outside of Comic-con demanding a sequel to Dredd that I had to see how delusional they must be.  I owe them a thanks!  Get this film...it comes with the 3D on the same disc as non 3D, get the idea the director and studio are trying to say something...like watch this film in 3D...that is how it was conceptualized.
1781162646|2.0|Book was crammed into container so the pages were folded backswards.  I am still trying to iron-out pages to make it easier to read.
159102594X|1.0|I bought this on the strength of its reviews, at Amazon and elsewhere, and that experience has left me deeply confused.<br /><br />This is a terrible book on nearly every level. I do not understand how it was published in this state, and cannot believe an editor even glanced at the manuscript. While there are a couple of interesting ideas and moments of wasted potential, this read very much like an unpolished first draft brain dump by someone with no experience even reading fiction, never mind writing it.
B008DW6VOQ|2.0|When viewing in Landscape mode, the type continues (unreadable) beyond the margin.  Basically cannot read news articles in Landscape. I have the folding case that allows me to read my kindle on stand.  Articles can only be read in Portrait mode.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Many years ago, several friends raved about this book.  I was to busy to do much reading at the time.  Although the book is several years since first published, it's story and message is eternal.
B009POHHRG|5.0|This is the perfect Batman Joker story.  You get everything from both characters and even a little origin story for the Joker.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Captures attention from first chapter and holds, with continuing surprises and anticipations.  I'm ready for more of the Vonnegut genre.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A wonderful distraction to pass the time while sitting in a doctor's waiting room.  I actually had the nurse wait until I finished the level..
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Totally follows along with the story line. Fantastic actors all around. Happy I bought it!! Hopefully there is another one coming!!
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|Like for many of us who are dedicated le Carre fans, I took some time to move beyond Geroge Smiley. But I always enjoy his books because he writes about people in a way that is unique. And so again with A Delicate Truth he weaves a story which moves us. His protagonist battles all sorts of dilemmas and to some extent we are satisfied with the denouement.<br /><br />I found it a gripping novel once I had got past the &#34;set-up&#34;, which in parts I found a bit laborious. I would thoroughly recommend the book to anyone who likes a challenging story and is a cut above other writers in his genre. It is pacy and when you get going difficult to put down.
B003XD7ECI|5.0|Michael Kiske rocks this!!! Always been a fan of Michael Kiske ever since Helloween but this music puts him over the top. And his duet with Amanda Somerville is a match made in Heaven. I'll be looking for more of her singing because of this album. FANTASTIC vocals on both!!
B005D4YHP2|4.0|the new sandal felt a little small or tight...but after wearing the sandal it broke in a bit &  they wear great
B003F3FJQO|5.0|so, basically, Thomas and all of the Gladers are finally out of the maze. The Scorch trials begins exactly where the Maze Runner left off. u should read this book.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Wonderful movie .....i could watch it over and over again .a movie for everyone.a wonderful movie for family night.or rent it for yourself.it takes you back too your child hood.
B002N2LEVM|5.0|The story lines kept my attention. I looked forward to watching the plot unfold in each episode. The cast of characters were very entertaining. Only wish the series was longer. Definitely recommend.
1452000247|5.0|William O'Brien paints a gripping and terrifying story in Peter: A Darkened Fairy Tale. I found myself thinking hat this book meshes well with the movies have turned stories into harsher versions of themselves. Very well written and not for the faint of heart. Barely made it out of there alive.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is great for all ages! It it is so fun! Some of the characters are funny looking but then you do their hair and they look better! You can make thousands of different hair styles and you can color, wash , and put accessories in their hair! Highly recommended!
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I wanted to love this book, I really did. And I appreciated the story and her writing style, but she could have done wonders with a little subtlety. Jace is hot, I get it. We all get it. You don't have to indicate that every single time he shows up -- which is all the time, it seems. He's nearly on every page. I'll admit I couldn't actually get through the entire book, so maybe that changes. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. I'll check out the movie and see if the story is better without the incessant fawning over Jace within the narration.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read the other two books written by this author and loved them.  So interesting.  Reading his books is like being there.  The characters are very colorful and easy to imagine.  I would definitely recommend.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|And needs to refresh constantly,  i click on two things and the out of sync alert pops up.  Im sorry but i dont have patience for this,  it also tells me internet connection was lost when noyhings changed,  im gonna give it one more day and if its the same it will be deleted.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Hi this is an great show. Got addicted to it now I'm paying to watch it. End of the review.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Season 4 is definitely the best season so far. This DVD set has cast and director commentaries that are definitely worth watching. Also a very funny gag reel. The one thing that is missing are the mini-episodes that were online between season 3 and 4. It would have been a nice addition.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|It looks great and sounds pretty cool. A bit like a tattoo gun but the screws loosed up quickly on it. Kind of ironic for a screw driver right?
B005Y423ZC|5.0|If you don't already love Adele you will after watching this DVD. Her stories in between songs are great and so funny, I love to hear her laugh. Great interaction with the audience. I prefer most of the live versions of the songs than the album version. And her cover of The Steeldrivers; If It Hadn't Been For Love is amazing!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Not sure why this movie took such a hit in the box office.  It is not great, but all and all a good action flix.  I would recommend it.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|There's an ad after EVERY thing you do. Gets overwhelming. It also takes some players entirely too long to play. Should be a way to auto play for them.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Full of facts, yet easy to read. I thought the middle was a bit much for my first pass so I skipped to the third section to read the diet portion. But, I came back and read the middle the next day. Very interesting!
1435114949|5.0|This is a very nice book.  Good addition to my library, after I am done reading it over and over again.
0061124958|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite children's books. I remember reading it myself and then to my children. Now, I have bought it to read to my favorite grand -children, who are the sweetest ever. This is one of the classic's that all children should should be read to--on Grandma's lap, now. Excellent illustrations. Wonderful book with the true meaning of friendship.
B00932A4XE|3.0|Free with prime so I can't complain.  Total chick flick, watched alone as a guilty pleasure on &#34;one of those days&#34; and it was decent.  Has &#34;fat amy&#34; and the main character from pitch perfect in it and they're both enjoyable.  Nothing like the book, and actually probably safe to say there is NO information on being pregnant.  It's just a bunch of pre-baby life drama.  You might cry once in the middle and at the end.  Chocolate, wine, popcorn & girl friends will enhance your evening with this movie.
034580404X|5.0|New and in perfect condition. It came early!! I finished the series in one month and I wish there were more.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I really enjoy the no time limit choices. Rather relaxing while still being challenging. Block colors could use some tweaking.<br />Plays well on an N7, HP TouchPad running CM, and Samsung SII.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great book! Lots of useful info and exercises! Highly recommended! Definitely worth second, third, and fourth reads! Pick it up! Cheap for how much good you get from it!
B00026L7O0|4.0|I ordered this movie at my husband's request (we both liked Silence of the Lambs) and it was pretty good. The acting was really good, but I did have a hard time with Clarece being Julianne Moore instead of Jodi Foster, haha!
6304480415|5.0|We saw this years ago and wanted a copy of but was too expensive new.  This was the best deal around and in great condition.  Thank you

B007RTAR64|4.0|This doll is a good addition to any collection. Too bad she can't actually hold the bow, but it's still great.

B00005ABIP|5.0|Great Music, for a great price.<br />this album is geared for those who like light rock. Awesome music for conservative music listeners
B0066NX2UA|5.0|Fascinating plots and compelling characters. I hope for many more seasons! I do hope however that the technical consultant teaches the lovely Kalindra how to check whether a pistol is loaded. She consistently does it backwards.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|There's only a few levels, as soon as it got challenging it ended, wish there were more levels because it was fun
B005F2BBLK|4.0|The boys love this movie and continue to recite lines from various scenes.  To me, it is okay, animation is well done, but the story is quite strange.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|If you want to kill some time playing chess.  This is a good app for just that.  Go  get it now.
B008ODZNLG|4.0|I enjoyed the interaction between Jiro and his two sons.  For anyone who appreciates good sushi, this is an interesting look at one man's entire life dedicated to perfecting sushi.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love Pinterest, and this app is really well designed. I can follow people, and people can follow me. I get creative ideas and their is a humor section for when I'm down in the dumps.
B001HN694K|5.0|This movie is brand new no one could as for a better quality movie. Plus we all love wonderland and Alice.

B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I really didn't think this film would pass the test but it certainly did. Beware: this film has a plot, a couple of twists, and a solid ending. Tread carefully.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|A must read. Gideon gives Christian Grey a run for his money. Never trust a hot redhead. I can't wait for book four!
B003B02OOG|5.0|I loved all the stories in this book!  I will read more from Grisham in the future. Can't wait till then.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Is this what America wants its &#34;Most Eligible Bachelors&#34; to be?  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
B0067R0APK|5.0|This is an excellent program for the kindle hd.  I use it frequently.  Try it yourself and you will see how much help it is to you.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I thought it was brave for a Neurosurgeon to risk his &#34;scientific credibility&#34; to share his moving NDE!  His story is truly miraculous and my prayer is that we all find our proof of heaven.
B00E1L9N8E|4.0|This was a good movie, but disappointing in some ways.  Visually, it is great to look at. Does a good job a capturing the feelings and mood of the Gatsby era, but it also misses something in the translation. The tragic love story is well conveyed, but both the book and the original movie seem to do a better job. It is still a good and fun movie to watch.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The suspense was killing me... and the outcome was predictable.  One two three four five six seven eight nine ten
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Reading this book felt like living through it again but with revelations not previously known--or perhaps forgotten.  I considered it well written.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|In the next update you should add bows and caves and maps and speed boats and a swamp biome and a new dimension.
B00AXOPK6W|5.0|In some ways the story is beside the point. So many people already know the characters, the plot, the various out-comes, that even a review is unnecessary.  However, all of the Austen works are windows into the past, a past without easy transportation, where communication was by voice or letter, where long visits to friend and family were the norm, in short, a world where people were the main attraction. Their language and conversation bear only a resemblance to our own, they converse about themselves, each other, those absent, what they did or might do, and all manner of descriptive information that was the fabric of life.  For all the talk of money and who had or would have so many thousand pounds (worth a cool million in todays buying power) the fact is that none of these characters was poor, or even in precarious straights. There were legacies, gifts, livings, and even servants in the 'cottages' to do the heavy work and help in house and kitchen.  Even the title of the book, Sense and Sensibility, embodies issues that only a monied class, even if poorly monied, could worry about at all. While, then, these stories are glimpses of the past, they are narrowly focused on style and manners, on romance and romantic hope, on expression of feeling and restraint.  And language... Jane Austen writes what she hears, not some common speech but an educated and experienced speech, refined at a thousand dinner tables, a thousand teas, a thousand visits in which the conversation was paramount. Any of us moderns would be left in the dust at a dinner party of Austen's time as the conversation swirled about us, passing from person to person in drifts of imbedded sentences and literary allusions.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was the best series ever! I don't usually enjoy reading but this had me glued to my kindle all day
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Awesome, speedy delivery. Package was not damaged or scratched. Definitely going to purchase more seasons of this comedy show in the near future.
B000QJM8Z0|4.0|I had a good time reading this. Very entertaining and funny. A bit silly at times, but that's what makes it work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun application-which I think many kids will enjoy. Download! This is a great application to just sit back and enjoy...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun. Challenging. Addictive. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a challenge. Can't wait for them to release more levels.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I really like &#34;Applause.&#34;  It is a fun, energetic song that can get you moving.  Expectations are always a problem for hit-makers.  It doesn't help when the buildup was pretty crazy (the Abramovic method video, all the teasing tweets).  While &#34;Applause&#34; doesn't match up to &#34;Bad Romance&#34; or the wild promotion, it is still a fun song, and I thoroughly enjoy it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so addicting it isn't even funny.  It is a morph between all other running games(temple run and subway surfers).
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love the game but when I go to a friends farm and I go home I'm at the friends farm not mine but it says that it is mine. any who I love the game I give it five stars
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I LOVE THIS APPS. IT  DOESN'T ONLY GIVES YOU A GUIDE FOR THE WORD OF GOD THAT YOU WANT TO CONTEMPLATE ON. YOU WON'T GET LOSS ON THE BOOK YOU ARE READING BECAUSE THEY ALSO PROVIDE A GUIDE OR LESSON PLAN. THEY ALSO HAVE A NOTE PAD TO WRITE ON JUST LIKE YOUR VERY OWN BIBLE STUDY LIBRARY. ITS THE BEST APPS I TRULY ENJOY MOST.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and graphics are simple but not childish. Difficult at times but not frustrating.  Great time killer! Perfect for waiting rooms. =)
0316201545|5.0|Loved the first book and have been very excited for this one to be released!  Very easy to read, humorous and just wonderful!
B009XWD02G|1.0|Couldn't download anything. I could only listen to what i already had on my device. Not worth it at all
B00B2166BS|5.0|It charges faster than my other charger and there is less wear and tear on the connector since the pogo connect is magnetic.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had heard great things about this book, so I decided to download it on my kindle today at roughly 4:30-5:00 PM, and here I am at 11:46PM writing a review of this lovely book.<br /><br />Let me just say, wow! Breathtaking dialogue! The amazing way of how Hazel and Augustus would speak to one another in an intellectual and poetical way, was truly amazingly written. The story line was very unique, yet it wasn't outlandish or far fetched in any way possible. My only problem with this book is that my expectations for men in real life have now been ruined by the very much original character, Augustus Waters.<br /><br />I must also add the context, in which a teen girl such as myself, that which Hazel has told the story was very relatable and enjoyable with how John wrote her describing 'ball-lessness' or throwing in a few 'whatever's' just to remind readers that she still is in fact a teenaged girl with just a better than most vocabulary and more developed way of how to say things.<br /><br />Recommended this book to my dear friend and even offered to read her a chapter a night before school starts up again. I however was joking, but from my summarized version of the story, she kindly accepted the offer. I however am going to make her read it on her own terms. All in all excellent book!
0062068423|1.0|Nesbo is all hype and no delivery.  He poses as an<br />interesting writer but does not have the depth or intelligence<br />of his idol, Henning Mankell who he tries to emulate.<br />By the end of the book, I was just slogging through it,<br />try to end it.  A disappointment and a cheat.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think this game was full of adventure and fun it was very like the episodes, except for that nightmare moon turned in to the kind princess Lunar like after the first episode but after that it was more addicting than Mine craft.
1907947655|1.0|This is one book I read over and over again, and my last copy had finally given up the ghost after about 10 years. This silly edition has barely lasted one reading. The pages began coming out immediately, and I now have loose pages stuck into the binding. Find another publisher - this one is cheap, poorly bound, and has nothing one would have expected in the way of extras from a special edition. I will never buy from this publisher again.
0811806405|5.0|Another book to help me with making a guitar it will be a great asset can't wait to get into it
B002ZG9846|4.0|I remember when this film initially was released in the theaters, I didn't think much of it. I kinda remember glancing at the trailers when it aired on T.V., and, like I said before, I didn't think much of it. I just thought it was another cheesy kiddie kick-butt flick. It didn't register that you wouldn't think that they would name a film &#34;Kick-Ass&#34; if it was truly geared toward the kiddie population. A couple of my former co-workers who are movie buffs were talking about this flick after they had seen it at the theater, and they were raving about it. So, I said to myself, &#34;Maybe I ought to check it out&#34;, and so I did. This movie definitely has it's share of bloody violence, foul language, and some sexual situations. Definitely not a kiddie flick, not something you would see on Nickelodeon. It's not one of the greatest movies I've seen, but it was pretty good. I might go see the sequel, it comes out today.
0761172726|5.0|I have been using this calendar for years and I love it!  There is a column for every member of the family so there is plenty of room for each persons activities.  I especially like the pocket at the bottom.  It doesn't hold much, but its a good place to keep important bits and pieces.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's an amazing book! It took me about a day to finish it. I highly recommend reading this book. :)
B001HN6EF4|5.0|My family loves to play Uno!  Regular Uno cards are hard to use outside especially if its a little windy!  H20 Uno is great!  The cards are heavier than plastic so they don't blow away!  Plus the plastic doesn't get all gross on the beach.  It's a bit annoying to get the card back on the clip, but its worth it to keep the deck together.
B00A285OOW|5.0|This was an interesting and fast read.  I also just found the book &#34;The Lady of the Rivers&#34; and am enjoying that.
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|The quality is great. The color as advertised and easy to find. Perfect to toss in my purse without worry of damage.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|The show was aired in June so if you did not see it I think you live in the moon lol
B000E8QVWY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film and imagine it will eventually be regarded as a classic, if it isn't already. But as a portrait of Johnny Cash it suffers from a serious flaw: the role of Jesus Christ in his life. I'm not a Christian, but Cash was, and while June Carter undoubtedly played a huge role in his life, to neglect the role of Cash's faith is to distort the picture badly. Read the account of how Cash kicked drugs, and you will see how different it was from what we see in the film. June was an important figure in the true story, but she played an auxiliary role; it was Cash's faith that was of primary importance. That is totally missing in this otherwise excellent film.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Anything Spielberg produces is usually good and this is. We bought it for grandkids to share with us during visits
0345529057|5.0|What I really liked about this story are the true-to-life characters and situations. The good ones do not always win and this is what makes the story very appealing to me. I think Martin is a good story teller, there are no boring passages and the way the story is organised, by characters and not by chapters, also makes it very dynamic and reader-friendly. I would also like to add that this is great entertaining reading, do not expect deep philosophical insights. Just allow yourself to be carried away into another world and enjoy the ride!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I played the new update it was fun there was a Sun and moon and name tags<br />Bugs fixed too
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|It's a great teen film. Kept her entertained for two hours. If it's your kind of film, you'll like it.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Found the movie to have a good moral story if not a little unbelievable at times.  Reese Witherspoon was different from her usual roles.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|bought one  of One Republics later CDs and found i really like and enjoy this band. lead singer really has great voice and the bands writing is worh the listen/
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I like this game on my phone.... it's definitely an adjustment going from my phone to my 7&quot; kindle fire HD. It works really well, as I haven't found any glitches. The only thing that was bugging me was how many times it asked for me to write a review. When it asked for a review, there were 3 options: yes, no, and never. I was continually pressing no, simply because I wanted to be able to write a review in case I found glitches (which I haven't), the only reason that I finally wrote one is because I wanted to be able to play in peace. Anyways it is a fun game, especially considering that it's free LOL
B002FOQY2M|4.0|this back east group i really like their music. bought the later cd and now i'm back this earlier one. obviously i like the group
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Can't put it down very entertaining better than Sub way surfer. The ,sound effects really adds to the gaming experience.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE  ANY PERSON WITH A IMAGINATION WILL LOVE IT<br />LOOKING FORWARD FOR SEASON 8 AND ON
1781162646|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was a nice quick, could not put it down mystery. I tried to guess the ending and who the killer was but I was wrong. This book is not your typical Steven King novel. It is not gory or scary so you can read it with the lights out. If you like coming to age or mysteries then this is the book for you.
0316154687|5.0|I finally understand what all the hype is about.  Gifted to me by a coworker, this book sat on my shelf for about a year.  I have an aversion to essay collections.  I like to get to know a character and follow a narrative through all of its twists, turns, highs and lows.  I couldn't be much different from the author - woman in early twenties living in California, never been to France or Japan, never spent extended periods in New York, never hitchhiked or quit smoking after decades - but so many of these stories felt like I was the protagonist.  So much of humor comes from relating to the story and somehow Sedaris struck a chord in each essay.  No need for punch lines, no apparent laugh-getting formula, and yet there I was - laughing.  Many of the stories don't lead with outright humor - some are more disgusting, sad, ironic, surprising and complex than they are funny but they are real and that in itself is packed with humor.<br /><br />I now find myself struggling with which of his books to pick up next but I'm sure whatever my decision, I'll have a good time.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was an eye opener! Wish this book was given to all married couples. It is amazing that the concept is so simple. Thanks for the insight!
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|It's a fun game but when you play it for a wile it randomly shuts off but you don't loose any thing just if your in a cop Chase that's when it happens
006056251X|5.0|The story of Evie and Lord St. Vincent. Definitely my fav of the 4, although they are all entertaining and worth the read.<br /><br />My favorites in order:<br /><br />#1. Book 3 - The Devil in Winter<br />#2. Book 1 - Secrets of a Summer Night & Book 2 - It Happened One Autumn<br />#3. Book 4 - Scandal in Spring
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderful!!!!  This is a fabulous book! I wish there was another!!!  A must read!!!! Highly recommend this book to all.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Its a great, strategic game.  My 5 year old son plays too & is starting to get the strategy down too! We only play 1-2 times in a sitting; its not something you could play for hours, in my opinion.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a wonderful love story!! I read all three books and now I'm re reading them!! Can't get enough of Ana and Christian!! Love all three books!!!
1609611543|5.0|I am in the middle of reading & it is changing my whole outlook on wheat & the affects on the body.  I have seen topics discussed in the book mentioned in other areas of my research on healthy eating.  Been wheat-free for about 6 weeks & feeling great!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love using kik. It automatically deletes messages and changing your profile picture is SO much easier than other messengers. You can chat with several people at a time, and it shows you if they've read your message yet. You can send pictures as well. Fantastic and runs smoothly
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Allows you to see overlap from neighboring networks to determine best channel to broadcast on yours. Confirmed my suspicion that my immediate area is so saturated, it's time to go dual-band.
0425263916|3.0|Reading about the characters fighting and making up is enjoyable. However, it just keeps going back and forth- I love you, I hate you, I can't live without you. Enough.
B005EHQGTS|1.0|It's OK as a freebie, but developer still sells the app when they have a newer one they'd prefer you buy. This is underscored by the requirement to dig for special instructions to configure with current server/client and no availability of the server that was actually developed for this app.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|But I really hate that you demand long winded reviews just so I can tick however many stars I want to give!
0767830555|5.0|Taxi Driver is the definitive cinematic portrait of loneliness and alienation manifested as violence. It is as if director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader had tapped into precisely the same source of psychological inspiration
1589795474|3.0|This book is very well written and researched and easy to read. The examples used were good and helpful in picking out areas in myself I see I can correct. I am only giving it three stars because it was much more narrow in scope than I was looking for and re-hashed the same topics over and over and over. By the time I was about a third of the way through I started thumbing through pages and then significant portions of chapters. Basically, to me, the message was that if you want to be a true millionaire the following traits are a must: Be frugal, be frugal, be frugal, be self-disciplined, be frugal, be educated in how to manage your money, and be frugal. Part of being frugal is not competing with the Joneses'. It was, to me, just as much a book about self-discipline as about becoming wealthy. The other key point is to do your children a favor and do not enable dependent behavior. This book will be perfect as it is for some people, but for me the authors could have definitely condensed the contents down to a couple chapters at most and then go into more detail about how, in general, to better manage money for wealth. They covered this at a VERY high level, I was looking for a few more details. Not which stocks to pick, per se, but an overview of effective ways to allocate the money you save by being frugal and make it grow (other than a low interest savings account).<br /><br />The good news is, I was frugal and bought this on sale as an ebook for $1.99 so I did not feel like it was a waste.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Great book, engrossing character development.<br />Parts one and two take a little time to get into, but after that point it is really hard to put down.<br /> I just really like the writing style too.<br />I can't wait for J.K.Rowling to write more.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Bruce just keeps getting better with age/ alot of action/ loved the guy who played his son/yippy kiya yeah as the story goes
1451695195|1.0|Author is predisposed to have a religious reaction.  So he did.  Biased, non scientific 'proof.,  no proof and no science offered in this tract.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|It was friggin great - The Arnold still has it and he brought it to the table - rocks it hard
B004H1V5RU|4.0|This game is of a devious design. How can so many elements be packed into a 12&#34; sphere. My one gripe is that the little on occasion will get stuck in the rim where the two halves come together.
B005LAII8K|4.0|Saw it in the theatre, and have watched it a couple more times on this BR and it still remains a unique movie
B0080K3G4O|5.0|Happiness is truly found in loving what is in your life and not seeking some outside fleeting and superficial goal. Confronting fears and overcoming challenges that life inevitably brings is where authentic happiness really takes root. This book takes an honest look at our culture's obsession with positive thinking  and some of the destructiveness caused by it .
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It kept my attention.  Lost a lot of sleep reading this.  Ordered the next book right after I finished the first
B000RD0RDU|4.0|Put it in as an upgrade from a 35mm fan on a Sabertooth Z77 Motherboard. Worked perfect, quiet and good cooling. Only drawback is no real 3 pin, just an adapter to make the 2 pin fit. Means no fan speed readout, but not that big of a deal for where i put it in at. the 10mm thickness seemed a tad thick also but it fit snug.
B009WUBERW|4.0|I enjoyed this because I didn't have to think about a plot or follow any intricate twists! Believable? No. Fun? Yes.
B008ALA6DW|3.0|Apple should have designed a better adapter. And of course for the price of the MBP Retina these should be included.<br />Seems to work fine but the size of the adapter is disappointing. Would be nicer if it was all in one unit without the cord between the thunderbolt end and the huge ethernet end. By definition a laptop user doesn't have the luxury of a spacious desktop to work on.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|The Good.- Follet does an excellent job showing why socialism was a complete failed experiment.  How Union power almost killed England and other Euro countries is a central theme.  His intelligent writing makes the clear arguments  of how pure American capitalism was the only savior for the western world.<br /><br />Ok - the fictional characters were only mildly interesting.  He spends much effort to show how much the hard core unionists and socialist almost destroyed countries that he made many characters downright boring or maybe that is the point. No one ever accused them of being interesting before but Follet brings many chapters to a crawl<br /><br />BLAH - the soap opera goes on and on for these characters.  It was general hospital as much as historical fiction.  This one has a bastard and that one is in love with the other relative.  What was the point of some if the sex scenes at those moments.  Come on, who really cares but I guess he did his research to get the female vote.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|I bought the movie on Blu-Ray because I loved it in theaters. The action is great and if you like gory stuff, this movie pulls off realistic looking gore better than any movie in recent memory. The reason I give the blu ray itself 4 stars was the special features are kind of lacking. I was expecting cool behind the scenes on how they did everything and instead got some interviews with cast members. There are some things that feel towards behind the scenes but never really reach it. The interviews with the cast are great but the special features overall left me unsatisfied.
0062238868|5.0|I found this to be one of the better Sniper books I've read. Its writing flows very well and it's not hard to interpret, if there was anything I found hard to understand most of the time the author had a breakdown almost right behind it. His style is very unique as well, I got the feeling he wasn't just writing a story but was having a conversation with the reader.  The author gives his firsthand account of what he experienced before, during, and after his participation in the war, that coupled with the additional writings of his wife, Taya, gave me the full view of how this war affects people on both the home front and battleground. The stories and lessons he teaches drew my attention very easily and I found myself unable to put the book down.<br /><br />Overall, his attitudes are expressed very strongly and he didn't get to political during the book. Chris Kyle does express how the politicians are affecting the war and how it's restraining the soldiers to the point its hindering the success of missions, but he doesn't overdue it to the point it feels like he's shoving his political views down the readers throat. The book paints him as a soldier who loves his job and is very skilled at it, his knowledge of the weapons he used is amazing as well as the scenarios he used them in. Chris Kyle is an extreme patriot that put God before country and country before family, something I cannot image is easy to do. After reading this I strongly recommend American Sniper to anyone who is a fan of true hero stories.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This is an absolutely-must-have performance. Raoul is excellent, Christine's voice is thrilling, and the Phantom's agony is so obvious and so powerful. And the post-performance bonus of five Phantoms from current and past productions singing with Sarah Brightman is stunning. For heaven's sake, get it!
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Good collection of songs, but beware if you are a music snob...some of the versions are singles (not full length).
B000L53D4O|5.0|I bought this for a one year old's birthday & she loves it. not much else to say,  is there.
6305511055|5.0|Great movie and I loved it.  Full of suspense and one of my favorite Robert Redford movies. Great supporting cast too.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Ive enjoyed this DVD over and over again. It has great entertainment value and the directors and producers did a great job with it.
B0058SNKM4|5.0|These are very comfortable,squishy shoes. Great for walking. I have been having some swelling I'm my feet and had trouble finding shoes that fit. These are perfect. The only negative is that they do get sweaty, but are easily slipped on and off under my desk for a breather.
B003RV43X4|5.0|Great DVD. My students enjoyed comparing it to the original Clash of the Titans. A well planned DVD for students of high school level.
0743297334|4.0|I enjoyed the background information about fighting bulls and about the Corida de Toros. Hemingway's narrative on the fiesta atmosphere put me in the mood for wanting to visit Spain and Pamplona.<br /><br />I did not care about all the drinking. While I know that some persons handle the liquor better than others I can't imagine having too much fun with a hangover.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Good movie for entertainment value. Action packed movie that has great entertainment value. Good video to watch at home; very enjoyable.
034553154X|5.0|Beautiful, imaginative illustrations of some key moments in the series. True fans would love to have it. I bought it even though the year was half over just to have the artwork.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Thorough book with tons of detail and a clear, simple plan that you can put into action right away. So many diet books miss the mark, but I walked away from 4HB with all the knowledge I needed to start making changes right away.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A humble, yet powerful and inspirational account of a working woman's plight!  It's everything we women have felt, thought about, cried about, agonized over and struggled with--but only with our inside voice.  This book releases it all for us all to acknowledge, accept and conquer our inward demons (demons, that we sometimes refer to as our practical voice) that hold us back.  I am so proud and taken aback by this book.  I am committed to leaning in with a sense of purpose and urgency!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun game but I wish the energy would last longer, it seems like as soon as I start to play I run out of things to do. Would recommend to a friend.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|The book provided a lot of common knowledge but its great to hear it echo once more. It was a reminder of the gender disparity in America. It was an easy read, which was smart because she could read a lot of difference demographics.<br /><br />I did wish she focused some of it on minority women (it's an oxymoron, I know). The voices of black, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, etc where not very much present. I'm a black woman feminist and a lot of things that she outlined where geared towards Caucasian women. I liked the book and Sheryl and will read more from her.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a great game for kids I love it it the best game ever you should get it to
B0089LOG02|4.0|Story though heartbreaking kept my interest and I had never heard about this happening.  It Would make a great movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series because the acting is incredible and the sets are magnificent. This is one of the best TV series I have ever watched. I love the characters, the time period and everything else.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Really fun. I must admit that you need to play it inside because some of the numbers are to hard to see outside in sun. The only problem I have trying to get it away from my wife.
1400069742|4.0|Lynn Olson has done a masterful job of telling the story of the debate inside the United States over intervention in World War II. While the book title focuses on Lindbergh and Roosevelt, Olson tells the entire story of the isolationist/interventionist debate in the United States in the 1930s. She does a great job of letting the reader know that the majority of the American public wanted to intervene in World War II before the attack on Pearl Harbor and that Roosevelt was simply too afraid of the isolationists in Congress to believe the opinion polls that overwhelmingly supported intervention by 1939-1940.<br /><br />Olson also does a great job of telling the story of the, sometimes reluctant, \\"head\\" of the isolationist movement Charles Lindbergh. Before reading this book I believed that Lindbergh was simply a racist who wanted Germany to win the war; now I'm not so sure. Olson does a great job describing Lindbergh's genuine belief that taking on the Nazi war machine simply wasn't worth the cost in blood because the United States didn't have a military capable of beating the Nazis. At least in the 1930s and early 1940s, he was probably right. Olson does a great job of discussing the context of Lindbergh's major pre-war speech where he made anti-Semitic remarks. In contrast to my previous belief that Lindbergh was simply a committed Nazi sympathizer Olson discusses Lindbergh's complete oblivion to how his remarks about Jews in that speech would be received by the American public.<br /><br />I also found Olson's inclusion of Charles Lindbergh's wife Anne Morrow Lindbergh in the book a great service to readers. Anne came from a pro-interventionist family and often found herself trapped between her parents beliefs and her husband's. In my opinion Olson's telling of Anne's inner conflict is sometimes the best part of the book.<br /><br />Overall an excellent work and quite readable.
B008220BLG|5.0|I saw it at the theatre, and couldn't wait for it be on sale.  Nicholas Hoult is my new hero.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I have eagerly awaited the final installment of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  It did not disappoint this reader.
1446249182|5.0|In my opinion this is a must for anyone using stats and SPSS.  Field finds a way to make the most complicated issue understandable.
B000SEGMAU|4.0|A well written and chronicled portrayal of a man, his observations  and philosophy on life' s meaning. A good read.
1878424114|5.0|This is a wonderful enlightening book. Deepak Chopra is such an gift. Thanks for the words of wisdom. When's your next book due out? :-)
B008OTTSX4|5.0|I bought this because I am a hardcore Joe Bonamassa fan, but there is a lot more to this with outstanding performances from many high-profile names in the music business. Iron Maiden, Joe Satriani, Carlos Santana, and Steve Vai are just a few. The Metallica cover of When a Blind Man Cries is amazing...I didnt know James Hetfield could sing that well.
B008476HBM|5.0|It transcends time and is a wonderful historically based period piece love story. Always fun to re-read. I loved it, AGAIN.
B00138EVJO|5.0|Amazon Bugs You for Review on Everything. I Don't Like it.<br />I give you 5 stars. Now you demand a written review. Forget it. Stop bothering me with your reviews. Go away.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|The songs are engaging as well as the multitude of famous actors/actresses.  The story line is funny and shows the transformation of a town over the summer because of a traveling salesman: the music man.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Matthew McConaughey was at his finest, with good supporting cast.<br />The story line was interesting, if not compelling.<br />Will watch it again...
B0090XLDKY|5.0|This musical is a classic and should be a part of everybody's DVD library.  It tells the classic story of the beginnings of talking movies and is full of good clean humor and great song/dance combos.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Very good graphics and space scenes. Very week story and predictable outcome. I wasted my time!<br />Tom Cruz is always good but the movie had no purpose.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is an excellent Rush Record. It definitely gets a lot of playing time in my house. I won't spoil the contents, but suffice it to say it is a concept album (and a really good one at that).
B006LSZECO|4.0|While the book was well writen and hard to put down, the ending was very frustrating. I prefer everything to be resolved so when it is not I am left unsettled and feel like I didn't finish the book. Frustrating.
B008JFUO36|1.0|one of the worst sci fi movies ive ever seen makes planet 9 from outer space seem like an academy award winner
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome , i started playing this game since my son was spending too much time with it , i decide to see why he was spendig too much time, now i know why.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved this book. the characters are smart and wise beyond their years. it was a fantastic book. i recommend it to all my friends.
B00884GR0W|5.0|It is awesome and fun. But it crashes all the time.<br />There are 2 modes story and exploring. Happy game
B0015T6G2G|5.0|Nelson Mandela's Long Walk to Freedom is a must read for all interested in the struggle against apartheid and the man who spent more than the  27 years in prison in this fight.Also it provides important lessons on leadership and determination.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|once in a while picsart would remove itself form my kindle and it would pies me off they need to fix that part
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I think this is an amazing game plus it kinds. teaches you a little about how to sew so I hope you enjoy it to.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|I originally got the free game and it is so fun that I actually got the full version. This game has a good replay value so it is money well spent.
1781162646|4.0|If you're a Stephen King fan (which I am, HUGELY!) you'll need to read \\"Joyland\\" - but prepare for a weak ending. No spoilers here, but I was disappointed - left unsatisfied. Great sex, no orgasm.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a terrific book for book club discussion. It lends itself to many topics that touch our lives. Set in England, it still crosses seas and emotions that we all either will fae, or have faced.  There are so many levels of personalities, goals, family interactions, and religious or spiritual feelings. I obviously, HIGHLY recommend this book!  Lorraine Lipton
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever you have to try it for yourself. It is like subway surfers but better.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect because 'Mission Impossible' wasn't in the title. The story line for 'Jack Reacher' was different, and kept my attention throughout. It was fun seeing Robert Duvall working with Tom again...I would recommend this film to anyone who has enjoyed Tom in 'Mission' films, as most of the action was similar; the only difference is that Reacher is a drifter...excellent fight scenes, and Reacher is more sinister than Ethan.<br />Don Matthews
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I love figuring out clues, glad to find game on freebies.  Easy to manipulate, teaches common sense and reasoning skills.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I needed this particular DVD for a very specific time event. I was so happy to get it and have it in an excellent condition. It was so easy to order .
B003VANOFY|5.0|Running Windows 8 64 bit and dont have any issues with the product (like others have reported).  They do feel a little cheap (but my other headphones are bose quite comfort,  so its kind of an unfair comparison).  But the plastic creaks a little and makes noises, the fake leathery material for the earcups is, well, fake.<br /><br />However, overall, the product is one of the better gaming headsets for this pricerange.  The wireless is great and I found the software to be very good as well.  The voice changer thing is more of a toy, but still fun when using it with friends in game.<br /><br />Overall, I think well worth the money and better than similarly priced gaming headsets with more features.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft ... so fun I all ready found 4diamonds on my world .best game ever . Worth your money . Get the GAME NOW
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|The Adobe Reader app functions well enough, but I was very disappointed to find that I had to open pdfs from within the app in order for Abode Reader to display them. Launching a pdf from the Documents folder will always utilize the default Kindle pdf viewer, which does not accurately display dynamic fields. There needs to be a way to change the default for the Documents folder so that Adobe Reader will launch upon selecting a pdf from the Documents folder.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It use to work much better before it changed it's format and advertising.  It sacrificed function for flash.  The maps and forecast are easy to get to and view.
B000WACTCK|3.0|The copy I received was very old and yellowed. I didn't expect that. It's usable, just not the quality I'd expected.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|Not exactly what I thought it would be.  It does allow you to print documents on your Kindle.  However, to print web pages or emails, you have to go to this app and use it like a web browser to print a web page or access your web based email to print a particular email.  I was hoping it would add a &#34;print&#34; option on the Silk web browser or the Kindle's email program instead of a stand alone software.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|The movie was made well, although I thought it was tad bit puzzling how the transportation aircraft could be knocked out of flight by lightning (??). Especially, given the technology that one would expect in the setting of the movie. Aside from a couple of inconsistencies of that same nature, everything else was good. The effects were innovative and added to the intensity of the action. The plot had a couple of interesting twists and the ending tied it all together. All in all, I would recommend this movie.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I use this to read many documents only available in this format.  If you have a print app on your Kindle, having the Adobe Reader will allow you to read the document AND print it if you wish.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is very very excellent. Although it is a little long and a little confusing, the ending is just amazing! I love this novel and highly recommend it to readers of romance.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I was impressed by the comfortable level of challenge.  Not so difficult that I want to throw my Kindle, not so easy that I got bored.  Downside is it didn't take long to finish the game.
B000088E6M|5.0|First off I wanna say that I was a 50 fan I bought his first four albums (Guess Whos Back,Get Rich, Massacre, and Curtis) I also bought the first G Unit album. all were really good albums with Curtis being the worse. I personally think hes another version of Ja Rule but thats just me. He got at Ja for singing and making love songs on tracks but turned around and did the same thing. I was partly turned off about 50 because before the albums started coming out was the only way he promoted the it was by starting beef with other rappers. The first album he went at Ja. The second album he was still going at Ja but added D Block and Nas to the mix. On the third album he was going at Fat Joe. That got corny after a while. An now his crew is gone. He has no one to beef with and now hes giving whole albums away online, beef with his record company and he cant give a record away... teaming up with Soulja Boy.<br /><br />But with that all being said Get Rich is a classic album. Everybody was at the top of there game. Dr. Dre gave him some of his Detox beats and fif just went in. there are some songs that are so so but the dope songs overshadow that. Then i read other reviews of his other albums and they're being rated low. i think thats the haters talking. Is it on the same level as Illmatic, What Thee Album?, Its Dark, Reasonable Doubt? No, but its close... So stop hating and listen to the album before you rate it......<br /><br />Best In The World!!!!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Inspiring book.  Great way of looking at our lives and our hidden potential. Turn off the wasteland that is television & read &#34;E Squared&#34;.  You'll have fun!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Can't get enough of this series . I loved it from the start.I look forward to Season 4 and new characters . It is so well written  and a bit of history . The characters are so interesting as well .
B00991TCOG|4.0|This is a great album I listen to frequently. Quite a pick-me-up when I need an energy boost, too. I am definitely a Stirling fan.
B0000074EF|4.0|Love TYA and no exception here just plain good rock and roll with no frills had my first copy of this on 8 track
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I have definitely learned that I can count on The Piano Guys for a powerful, beautiful, and fun album.  This one is frequently played in my home.
B008NR90HQ|4.0|where can you find Manic Depression and I don't live today played live  Good quality sound and picture and a flash back into time
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|While a little tentative about this movie at first, friends strongly encouraged that I give it a try and they were right - I adore it!  So much fun and with catchy music, too..
B0025KVLTC|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best<br /><br />This is the best Beatles disc that was ever done.  Great tunes, and pointed a new direction .  The engineer Geoff Emerick was also instrumental in the sound of thses recordings.  A first rate listening experience.
B00B1ME3DQ|4.0|It's hard to top The Elephant Riders and Blast Tyrant (not to mention the self titled &#34;Clutch&#34; album) but this record proves that they can still rock out and their riffs are still original and heavy.  A really nice funky feel to a lot of the songs but that almost southern rock garage metal feel is layered throughout.
B00A285OOW|5.0|It was great to see a book on a Princess/Queen that hasn't been touched upon by many books. I've always been a fan of Philippa Gregory's book and of the history of the English crown. While there are parts that are fiction that are enjoyable it's also great to have some historical incite onto the times. I can't wait for her next book to be released.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I like this app. I had it years ago on my Android phone (I have an iPhone now) and I used it all the time because I have so many apps. It really helped keep my battery lasting on that beast. I like the updated look now for the Kindle and hope it continues to perform well. If so I will get a version for my Samsung Tablet. Recommended.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Another year of Jaxson figuring out his role...doesn't disappoint.  we can't wait to watch next season.  who will be next...?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed seeing the relationships that developed, although there was much heartbreak. I hope the writer can keep the story going.  I can't wait for season 4!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is so awesome! I play it almost every day. It's even better than temple run two and the other temple runs.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|My husband and I watched it with our teenage daughters and enjoyed it.  The acting was better and the story better than a lot of movies made for young people.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think that minecraft pocket need's to update becuse I still  have v.0.7.1 and I try to play but my friends minecraft got update on there phone.  but on the kindle Fire it didn't want to update. So I need minecraft fan to help update on the kindle Fire
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I refer to this app more than any other.  Like the feature of having a list of various cities which I can access instantly.  Keeps me up on how weather is for my extended family.  Love it.<br /><br />Ken
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Entertaining for both adults and children all so teens. It is lots of fun, you get to buy new characters and boost and upgrades.
B0000CFW87|3.0|Haven't listen to him as much as I thought I would - got this for my niece but she is listenting to Il Volo - but I think we will get back to listening to him later

0425263924|1.0|After book two, I was so excited how things appeared to be coming together and then the book ended on a huge cliff.  I thought for sure book 3 would blow my mind and reveal all.  I just had to give it a try.  I REEEALLY wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book.  Sooo bad...sooo very, very bad.  And how dare Sylvia Day stretch this train wreck into a book 4?  Just let it go.....please
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|People hew like the playstore from aneroid andwant to get aneroid apps like gta 3 or CoD black ops zombies then go to browser and search 1mobilemarket.Apk or type in 1mobilemarket.com and enjoy<br />this app is no scam or virus / serveys :)
0060191325|5.0|I have read this book before and bought this for my future sister-in-law. It really helped me to see things differently and I hope it will help her and my brother have a better relationship.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a REALLY good book! I very much enjoyed reading it and read it in like 3-4 days! Loved it! :)
B008M4MB8K|5.0|The set contains four versions of BLADERUNNER. Each of them somehow look even more beautiful than they did when I saw them on the movie screen.
B00E8B1358|3.0|I love GI Joe from a kid, so I liked the movie.  You need to have that kind of connection to enjoy it though.
B0000TB050|5.0|One of the best U2 concerts you will ever see on film. This is a must have for any U2 enthusiast.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I got caught reading this a few times and blushed. Well worth the read. Totally the best book to read before bed.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I got this as a gift for my better half since she loved the show (I had never seen it). We sat down one Saturday to watch some episodes and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It's a shame the series ended the way it did. Leaves you wondering what the big network execs think 90% of the time....
B005WBBYXO|1.0|I felt like I was reading a book for a 10 year old.  With a simple storyline, and bratty kid girl as the hero I could never warm up to it.  I kept waiting for this deep theme that I read about in reviews that would appeal to adults, but nothing seemed that deep to me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is the best game that I ever played! Plus now I know how to mod it and use the nether reactor core in creative mode!
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|A great second installment from author Brandt Legg, writer of 'Outview.' This book continues the adventures of Nate and Yangchen and the story of the Movement. The book is about young adults but can be enjoyed by all ages. It neatly intersects sci-fi, adventure and paranormal and is a very well-written and compelling story. Brandt Legg has improved on his impressive debut and should only continue to flourish as an author. Recommended.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I love it! Every time it comes on on my phone, I have to keep replaying it. As much as I liked the BTW album, I'm glad she's going back to her edm roots. Can't wait for ARTPOP!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love the halloween section. I guess the others are great too. I think the graphics and all are fabulous. I am intrigued by how the blocks you knock down fall differently every time.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This rather slight effort was still charming and disturbing by turns, Mr. Gaiman has a true gift for expressing feelings, even complicated and mixed ones, this book also particularly focuses on showing events may not be what we and others recall but what we have forgotten. I liked it and and look forward to more.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|it is so much fun!!! I think it is better then toca boca hair salon 2 cause hair salon is free a toca boca is NOT.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Some new-to-me information about the region and time where Jesus lived. Helps one develop a totally other idea about why people follow Jesus based on his radical point of view.
1608871452|5.0|This book is great! It has some goodies on the inside too; posters, post cards, stickers, smaller booklets all related to the show, some of them are like inside jokes, only true Supernatural fans would know what the items are referring to!
1878424319|5.0|The four agreements recommended for personal peace in this book are absolutely phenomenal. I can't say I agree with everything in the book, but I do ascribe the those four statements.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest  if you want to know something or see something you can find it on pinterest its great
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love all the Percy Jackson books! And I am very inspired by the books, I read them quite joyfully and hope everyone who reads them shall do the same!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game had me wanting to play more and more ans it also had me really into the game wanting to know the ending.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This  game is wonderful for kids from 1 to 100! It Is wonderful amazing and th  graphics are never  blurry. You can pet, wash and feed your horse. I recommend parents to do this: let your kids buy at least 30 dollars in gems. Yes even my chihuahua loves this game because she tapped the screen as I was  playing it.LOL!!!
B000UD0ESA|5.0|I always wanted the final cut, hoping that it would bring a little extra to the regular movie. I think it does.<br /><br />Not that Blade Runner needs it perse. Great story line, involving character and directed to perfection by Ridly Scott, both versions are great flics.<br /><br />Deckard, a blade runner, has to track down and terminate 4 replicants who hijacked a ship in space and have returned to Earth seeking their maker in order to have him remove their end of life date that was inserted into theirs genes when built.<br /><br />As with all good movies, you find your self seeing the end credits of the movie wondering why the movie was so short, when in fact time flew by.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I am enjoying UNO and I am looking forward to my Facebook friends joining me. I have always loved playing the game throughout my life, and this is even better because nobody has to shuffle all of the cards.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|While the story was something I was looking forward to, the presentation I felt was a litttle choppy.  There were times I thought that the author could have expanded some of the interviews to give a more complete picture of the horror people were living through.
B000006YXV|5.0|It is the best of Marvin Gaye and one can enjoy the songs from the past as we remember them...
0896898288|5.0|Beautiful book, lots of ideas.  It reminds me of quilts my grandmother had when I was a child.  It is a great addition to my library.
B00B8O4VHU|3.0|If you want it all, then this belongs in your collection.  And thanks to estate for excellent cleaned-up recording quality, documentation, and nice photos.  But - it is a pile of leftovers. If you are not a Hendrix afficianado/collector/zealot, this will not be a good purchase.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|A decent entry in this series that offers some nice moments of excruciating anticipation. In a genre that depends on heavy CG FX work, PA4 offers a chance to watch something that is mostly shot in camera, builds slowly and effectively draws you in.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed it.<br />I liked the movie and I'm glad I saw it first. The colors stood out in the movies but the characters had depth in the book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's game touched me with the simple power of Ender Wiggin's story; the complexity and depth at which Orson exposes the mind of this genius child giving the book a level of realism rarely touched by science fiction. I felt so strongly for this young boy who himself was bound with mountains of pent up, yet fixatingly restrained emotion. The author, Orson Scott, absolutely refused even a momentary sigh of relief by challenging every imaginable cliche I could hope to find in the conclusion of this solemn epic and, without leaving the story unfinished in the slightest, left me desperately excited to read the sequel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's awesome but the chests don't work! Single or double, I try to put items in the chest but it'll just open and then close... can you fix it please??
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|We did not have access to the show when it came out, so I bought the series after people told me how good it was.
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|Well, Tom Cruise got his pound of flesh out of me. This was a total disappointment.  Tom ought to go full time with Scientology.  What a waste.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Useful, easy to use and free! What more could I ask? Back up also great, nice layout, clear and fast!
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|Having now read two books by this author I have to say she has become one of my favourite authors.  Gritty, dark, gripping, compelling, unforgettable, edgy realistic fiction.  My kind of book, the ones I like to read and love to write. Books that make you mull over them long after you've finished it. Some might find this book a bit too graphic but I loved it.  Peeling away the layers to find unexpected surprises and twists.  Great writing Gillian Flynn!
B00CCEHX5W|3.0|...but my gut knows that is unfair to Deafheaven, who have made competent record, even a very good record, but, alas, the ridiculous fanfair for this group is unwarranted.<br /><br />(The review that follows began as a comment on another review of this album, which, you might find if you go look...)<br /><br />Nothing revolutionary about this album, except maybe the pink cover. It's a good album, but a logical step in a LONG tradition of black metal (c'mon, this genre is closing in on the thirty-year period, people can stop acting like it is groundbreaking). Black metal has had \\"Godspeed\\" or \\"post-rock\\" structures since before Godspeed! was even around. Go listen to old Mayhem, Emperor, Ulver...it's all epic and nuanced structure. The main difference is that Pitchfork and other trendy zine's weren't covering metal back then. I'm glad you like the album, but I've got to let people know how NOT groundbreaking this album is.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was very interesting. It keeps you wondering how someone could do something like that to someone. How they can just take advantage.I highly suggest this book to anyone and everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game.  I found out a tip that you are in fact earning free coins as you play.  The trick is in order to claim the coins, tap on the Goals menu from the main screen. Along the top you'll need to toggle from the goals tab to the achievements tab. Scroll through the list and see if any are completed. If they are you'll see a claim button next to it. This tip works.  I now have 111 coins.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm so very glad I was told to check Pinterest out. I have found so many useful tips &amp; hints that really worked. Plus some funnies. I can look for hours at one thing then see something else that I'd find interesting. Anything you're in to can be found here.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|It was refreshing to see the growth in both of the major characters.  Although they were from two very different socio-economic backgrounds, what each of them learned from the other made each of them richer as a human being.  It is well-written and well-acted, with a great balance of human drama and humor.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is similar to the popular game subway surfers. If you like subway surfers you should try minion rush.<br />You can log in to Facebook to challenge your friends and earn tokens to upgrade your very own minion.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|It is a little far-fetched but absolutely hilarious.  The mean school mistress was a riot and I thought she made the whole movie.  I could watch this ovie again and again and laugh just as much as the first time I saw it.  Absolutely a scream!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good app. Almost like temple run, but more<br /> intreging  . I loved it  great app.<br /><br />It was a good<br /><br />app.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|i love uno ....it takes me back to when i was in school playing at lunchtime with my friends.... good times are back again
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had liked minecraft<br />but couldnt get the<br />full version. I love<br />This!!! Best app Ever<br /> going to get on now.
1616550414|5.0|I was thinking of buying the jap version but I said to myself: \\"oh, come on, you cannot speak japanese! English printing must be good enough...\\" WELL, it's more than good!<br />Very beautiful and cared edition, the printing is really good, the paper grm are fine... my only dislike is for amazon's packing! since one of its corners was crushed :( but well, that's not the item itself but amazon's mistake.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|It's so fun I love this app! Best time<br />Spender! Everyday I check my account and<br />Their is always  something new also everything is free<br />It's a very  great app!<br />GET IT SO FUN
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My son absolutely loves this  movie, it is cute especially for his age group! He has watched it over and over!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Absolutely Love the Show! I like how Dexter is moments, hours, or in some cases minutes from getting caught and he is able to dodge getting arrested. I'm not sure if I like his sister knowing about him, but we'll see.
B001HN694K|4.0|Perfect remake of a classical film with some neat twists. Johnny Depp was in fine form as he portrayed the mad hatter.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|When you are reading you think you are holding a real book!! If you are watching something it stands at a good angle. Light weight. I love that it shuts off and turns on the Kindle when you open and close it. I bought the red one because I husband could never find the old Kindle. He can always see this one in it's red case!
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|This case is exactly what I wanted. This is the refreshed version of the case. I've read the previous version had misfits and other slight problems, all of which have been addressed in this newer version. Its very well fitted,  looks excellent,  and protects what's important.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Really catchy set up that ropes you in but the reveal isn't quite as good as the mystery.<br /><br />I wavered between a three and a four.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|hate it cant log out and when you deinstal it you cant instal it again I would not recommend getting it if you aren't online
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is a mixture of subway surfers and angry Gran run so much fun I love playing it!! The only thing that is bad is some time it runs slow on the kindle fire.
B00797MB0O|3.0|I think Theron is an interesting actress -- such chameleon. I think she was doing someone a favor to make this film. She does a great job with the kooky character she plays, but the screen play is ehhhh!
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|Your money is better spent elsewhere. This is a soulless, badly acted, shallow film. It's as substantial and satisfying as cotton candy. The director and writers should never work again. Yes, writers, plural. Generally the more writers the worse the movie is and that's the case here. I have generally liked all the actors in other things; Franco, Kunis, Braff, Weisz and Williams. But here they are terrible which I blame on the writing and director. I got about 30 minutes in before I turned it off. Don't waste your time on this.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great fun!  I could play for hours except I run out of tokens. To me, the only downside is the need for tokens.  Tokens? Stupid!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|If you need to protect a Kindle Fire HD this may be the case for you.  It's padded to protect.  I really enjoy the swivel feature, that's what drew me toward this case.  It's great!  My single complaint with the case would be bulkness and weight.  Combined with the weight of the Kindle it makes it heavy to hold the device for reading while horizonal.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|i was sorry when this book ended.<br />A little suspense.. A great story. East to jump right into the story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|What a fun app!  Very entertaining and challenging. Wonder what the upgraded version is like, but not enough to spend money getting it.The free version is just fine.
B0063IH60K|3.0|its ok in a pinch.  micro soft version tells you when there are no moves left and that the game is over.
0345528581|5.0|I bought this because I travel so much and didn't want to bring equipment/dvd's with me. However, I've pretty much abandoned all my other workout stuff because this is all I need at home or anywhere. I highly recommend the app that goes with it too, making it easy to follow the program and take it anywhere.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|Love the Sigma Force books.  This one is every bit as absorbing as all the other ones I have read.  I thoroughly enjoyed it. Make a good long reading date a n d enjoy.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I'm using this app on the kindle fire and it's so tiring. The app shuts down unexpectedly. It won't pin from websites. Most of the time I have to &quot;heart&quot; something and then when I get to a computer I can pin it from my likes. It's ridiculous how often it freezes or just goes to a white screen after asking me to choose which board to pin to.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|All songs on this set are excellent. Tracks that come to mind are Days of the Ring, The Sacrifice of Faramir, and Lighting of the Beacons. But it could be that the visuals that accompany them are so compelling that the music got automatically attached to it in my mind.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It is either free or not.  Adding ads is no problem but having to do facebook and other junk iss not worth the bother.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I wish I could AutoRip this album. Sigh!<br /><br />Still, the beginnings of the story are very well put to music. Moria and Balin's Tomb are particular favorites of mine.
0545586178|5.0|Great, new as ordered. I got it within 2 weeks and it is in plastic. = ) so far so good.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|What has become of musicals? The music in this was derivative and the tunes were absolutely forgettable. It seemed like they were trying to elevate it to semi-operatic status, but it didn't work as either opera or musical. I enjoyed the actors and liked that they sang without lipsynching, but the creators of this musical took an interesting, important book and turned it into a superficial, ridiculous, grandiose piece of puffery. See a great musical like Candide instead.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I heard an interview with Dave Grill about the Sound  City Studio and thought I would check it out. The. movie will appeal to anyone who grew up listening to 70s music.
B004EI3ON4|4.0|If you like Daft Punk its a great listen.  Put it on, sit back, and enjoy the show.  Even better if you have some cool lighting to go with it. :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why won't it update my sis has the update on her google play but I don't have it came out 8/15 WTF amazon
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Should be a required reading for everyone! Superbly written, it reads like a thriller.  All who like history will discover new way to look at religion.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Most show do not leave me feeling happy. This show does, leaves you wanting more. Great show! Love it! Totally hooked.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is a police procedural of a different flavor. Lead actors Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic have excellent chemistry, and Nathan Fillion is in the zone as witty best selling author Richard Castle. Stana Katic also shines as the stunning and intelligent Kate Beckett, an excellent foil for Castle. A must see.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Works as well as the bluetooth that came with my car.  I purchased two- one for my second car and one for my RV.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I really love tubemate but it has to many virus because once I uploaded the app my phone started acting up. Wish the problem will be fixed.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is so funny. I've laughed throughout the entire movie every time. I've probably seen Pitch Perfect more than a handful of times with different friends or family. Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow and Skylar Astin have perfect comedic timing. I enjoy the quick whips and the music mash ups a lot.
B0057RBWN0|5.0|i'm a huge fan of the film grease and also I like john Travolta and Olivia newton john I can also remember seeing the film when it first came out
B003HE2B6C|5.0|Annie Byrne<br /><br />Say what you want about this group but they are amazing. I think this is one of my fave albums of all time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun games for the kids ,and its is fun when you really get in to the game . I love this game
B0010T0OCY|4.0|Thought this movie was great! Don't expect the production quality of The Matrix but the costumes and special effects weren't bad.  It is a nice mind bending story line that will make you want to keep watching to find out why the weird city and its inhabitants are so strange and what is going on.  I thought the acting was great and the plot was strange enough to make it interesting without going overboard.
0307387178|5.0|Our first book got lost in the mail, and this seller was quick to send us another copy.  Great book.  We rented the movie as well, and it actually stuck very close to the storyline in the book.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|All I can say is that I was left confused on this movie. I could not really even follow the plot. Just a strange movie......
B005WTR4ZI|2.0|I did not like the writing style.  There seemed to be little interest in attracting the reader.<br />Too many graphs right at the outset of the book.<br />I think the book will only attract specialized readers and not readers who do not<br />know the field and are seeking to improve their general knowledge.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Enjoyed this movie!  The plot was more thoughtful than I expected.  Glad we rented it; now I need to read some of the Jack Reacher books.
0393334988|4.0|Although the style seemed to be by someone not accustomed to writing<br />the story he portrayed was gripping and held my attention throughout the<br />book.  I would recommend the book to readers of contemporary history and<br />those interested in the war in the Pacific, 1941-1945.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|she and Michael got it on. Now leaving the ending to find Michael, the love and father of Celine's daughter.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Quick response and delivery.  Great show so was so very glad to receive.  This way I get to watch my FAVORITE show over and over again.
B005LAIH54|5.0|I love watching it.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Quick response and how could I not be pleased with one of my FAVORITE shoes.<br />Will use again very soon.
B002ZG977Y|4.0|the story from the first movie with Harry Hamlin as Perseus. Still like it and the older version movie also.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I saw this one in the theatre, so I knew I would like it.  I wanted to refresh my viewing before the second installment comes out later this year.
B004SIP8JI|3.0|Who didn't like Meg Ryan at some point. I did. But I like Hugh Jackman more. Still love him as Wolverine.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I really like this game. It is a lot like the original cut the rope instead now you have to feed the candy to two om noms. This game is really easy and only has 15 levels in each time. I would recommend this game to anyone, especially of you liked cut the rope.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I have seen it at theater. I love greek mythology. I cannot wait to see Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|This is a fun game. It is a lot like the other 2 except Om Nom ends up at a scientists house. Although this game is a bit more tricky than the other 2. Some of the levels are really hard to pass. Overall I give this game 4 stars. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the other cut the ropes and challenges.
B004LWZW8I|4.0|that had a good story to it. A mortal fighting the Gods of Olympus. A mortal who became godlike in greek mythology.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I enjoyed this game at first, but then my points started randomly dropping. For instance, I had around 3200 points, and then I exited the app to check my e-mails, and when I came back to it, my points decreased all the way down to 135! And that's not even the first time that's happened. How the hell am I supposed to compete in the weekly tournament if this is going to be happening EVERY WEEK? Also, the whole token thing is just dumb, because you basically have to rely on the Free Scratch cards unless you're dumb enough to waste money on one of the packs.
B00003CXRM|3.0|replacing VHS movies and this was one of them. Besides Wal-Mart was a little pricey for an older movie I think.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I really do like this game but I do not like that people can call u bad words it is wrong.
B00003CXMG|4.0|replacing VHS movies and this was one of them. Besides Wal-Mart was a little pricey for an older movie I think. But loved the era of time.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was everything all the talk was about and then some.  I read it twice, so I could focus on the story line the second time.  I would recommend it to friends
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Really Gameloft 2 days in a row, go to the app store for update and there is NO update. I love the game so much that I have put up with all the glitches and problems with Gameloft Live but I think my game is gone for good this time. Get your act together, pretty soon you won't have any customers at all after reading all the reviews listed here. So totally crushed I really enjoyed playing while I could!<br />***Well they fix something and then something else goes wrong (whatelse is new) my land expansions now cost 380,000 coins!!! Are you kidding me? It was at 52,000 before the update. Guess I wont be expanding too much any more;(<br />***8/23/13 still having issues with land expansion down to 340,000 coins...ya right.  Now I can't visit my friends. It is so close to being uninstalled. Very sad:(<br />***9/17/13 just logged on to my game and $30 cash has vanished, I loved this game and gameloft has sucked the fun and energy out of me. You can't even add more reviews as you find new things going wrong; more like down hill. I just hope and pray that everyone can see and read my additional posts because I used to put up with some minor glitches but losing $30 is the last straw!!!!<br />****12/21/13 Gameloft is back to the same crap, updates that don't work, money missing, not being able to visit other towns! When is this going to stop! Is anyone else having trouble with this game? I hope Gameloft can see these posts but do they really care? Please get your act together!!!!!<br />12/22/13 just uninstalled Oregon Trail, after logging on to the game today another $30 cash gone!!! I'm totally done with this game!!! Thanks Gameloft for ruining a wonderful game and a wonderful way to relax!!!!!
B00CS74W0C|4.0|The book is as everyone described.  It certainly was not the level or near as good reading as Fifty Shades, but it was ok.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Myself and my son love this app. He is two and can play better than my husband.  Wish however there were more ways to earn coins other than money.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|It's educational and entertaining. It will quickly change how you interact with your canine friend and improve both of your lifes.
B000063K2W|5.0|it was in excellent condition, and the movie of course i loved it , i watched the movie with family and friends and they all loved it and asked me where did i get this movie and it is in good condition and i told them from amazon, they thought that they only sold books now they know that is not all they sell.
1741794609|5.0|Good info and tips. I have used Lonely Planet before and I trust them. We'll see how the trip goes!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is absolutely addictive. Hooked from the very first minute. Recommended by my teenage sons. One of the best free apps on my kindle!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love playing this game it's so much fun and you can do and build what you want but be careful it's highly additive
B002HNA95E|4.0|Let me preface this by saying every song on here is a classic. It starts off in turbo mode with &#34;Hung Up,&#34; &#34;Music&#34; and &#34;Vogue.&#34; But the issue starts with track 5 &#34;Holiday&#34; (1983) following the 2008 hit &#34;4 Minutes.&#34; It's too radical of a shift. The sequence is not chronological, which sometimes heightens a Greatest Hits package. However, when some songs are 5 years old, placing them next to 25-year-old songs, then going back to say, a 15-year-old song can leave the listener frustrated as it sounds like a bad mixed-tape or a low-quality burned CD or an inconsistent playlist, lol. Compilation releases aren't necessarily meant to create the ambience of an album featuring all-new music. But previous Madonna hits packages &#34;The Immaculate Collection&#34; and &#34;GHV2&#34; have created a better cohesive feel.<br /><br />My solution as an alternative would be to have the track-list run chronologically or to remix or remaster the hits so that they all sound like a cohesive production.<br /><br />It's a shock that any compilation containing these classic songs would fall flat, but execution is important, too. On a positive note, new fans may enjoy these indelible classics regardless of the album's execution.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Gotta wait an entire 24 hrs. to get Bingo credits. You're waiting for a number & it comes up, but by the time you click on the number the game is over before you can click on Bingo, so you lose out! Call too fast!
B00846REIS|5.0|Better than 50  +shades of grey....I can't put it down! Looking forward to the  4th book! Highly recommend this book!
6305907145|5.0|Love amazon movie collections I continue to build up my collection of movies. Just make sure the company your buying from has good reviews and a high score and look to see if they have any major complaints on them . I never had any problems but I always checked there reviews! Perfect movie Five Stars
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|The movie was very well done and was immensely entertaining. I would recommend this movie to anyone with even a slight interest in the L.A. mafia.
0767020308|5.0|Love amazon movie collections I continue to build up my collection of movies.

B00CH87HF4|3.0|Putting this game onto my Kindle takes a bit of memory, but it's not a bad game in its entirety. I give it a 3/5.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This game is so cool you can make a picture of you in your house with any thing you want
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Have only been using this for a couple of days but it does everything I expected of it. If I still feel the same in a couple of months I'll change the rating to 5the stars.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This movie wasn't bad.  It could have been 30 minutes shorter, but it is entertaining.  The movie moves at a very slow pace, but not because it is building the suspense, and giving you the feeling of being in the movie.  Just because it is way too long.<br /><br />The movie was actually a little boring.<br /><br />There is one part, when Jack discovers the plot line, and you are expecting the action to start from that point, and become interesting.<br /><br />However, there is a litte action scene, and then back to the dramatic dialogue between the man and woman, and more of the love story in a secure place.  It just didn't make sense.<br /><br />There is no sense of urgency in the film.  Urgency first to discover sinister plot is going on.  Then once the plot is discovered, urgency to fix the problem of peril. Those are the types of things that keep you on the edge of your seat, and interested in watching a movie.<br /><br />Jack and is partners characters aren't developed in the time before the plot becomes known.<br /><br />I like Tom Cruise movies a lot.  I find MOST of his movies very good.<br /><br />This movie could not be called an action film, nor a thought provoking flick.<br /><br />The storyline is an intersting idea, but execution is very bland.<br /><br />There are no unexpected plot twists, which you would expect from such a slow movie to unfold.<br /><br />A sharp contrast to this film would be one of my favorite, Vanilla Sky.<br /><br />Some of my favorite Tom Cruise movies have been Vanilla Sky, Magnolia, Jack Reacher, War of the Worlds(although it really fizzled out at the end), and Minority Report(a little corny, but watcheable)<br /><br />If you want to watch it, there aren't any major holes in the story, just that the movie doesn't envoke much in the viewer.<br /><br />Mark :)
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Missing MANY of the features found on the Google Play Store and Apple iTunes Store. Don't buy here unless they add Zen Garden and the minigames.
B005S9ELY4|4.0|Base on a true story. I enjoyed it very much ! I found it on Amazon for a great price.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|This app didn't work at all.<br />It won't even open or allow me to play videos on youtube. It was a waste of frustration.
B001FOPODS|5.0|A few years ago I had recorded this but I lost the tape.  (Yes, that's how long ago!)  I so enjoyed it that I purchased this for my young nephew.  Of course the music is beautiful.  The animation is compelling.  Who cares if the story line is not followed exactly?  This is great entertainment for adults as well as kids.  Keep in mind that the story could be a little scary for those with very sensitive souls.
B001RU2YUQ|5.0|This is a great movie just love it. I recommend the movie for everyone. If you like action then rent this movie.The actors did a wonderful job bring this great story to screen.
B00A27X972|5.0|It was a fast and enjoyable read and I would recommend it to family and friends as a fun read
B0075TDWEU|4.0|My four stars are for the functionality of these headphones. I have purchased many pairs (probably 2 dozen) of these over the years.  I use them running, both outside and on the treadmill.  A pair typically lasts about 6 months (then a wire breaks internal to the insulation), and I replace them with another pair for about $8.  They fit my ears well, and deliver acceptable sound.  I've just gone to order several more, and find that the price is now over $40!  Sorry, but there's no way these headphones are worth that kind of money.  I'll need to find a different brand/model that fits my requirements.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case is very well made. It holds my Kindle very well and works well. The angle of the screen while standing is very adjustable to almost any angle you may need. The automatic on and off feature is great. I couldn't ask for a better case for my use.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I liked the movie. I liked the plot and the implementation. Don't want to spoil anything for those who did not see the movie, so will stay away from specifics.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This puzzle game is a great time waster. Not too easy and not too hard, it is just right. The only problem is it lost all my progress for no reason that I know of.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Wish the power button was easier to get to go on or off.  sound quality good, little lag.  long enough battery life, good range.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|IF this is saving the pictures somewhere, I have no idea where. If I knew that, I'd rate this higher, but truthfully I don't see this as much different than any other picture editors. And those actually saved in the gallery.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a cool game I have ever played my house is cool like a little mansion but made of dimonde. its my favorite game ever
B001O8KRW8|3.0|There are about two pieces (Chega de Saudade, the Girl of Ipanema), that are at the level that I expected from this CD. The other Brazilian pieces were okay but not as exciting as they could be (given the abilities of this performer). I was disappointed by the shallow rendition of most of the American selections.I would not buy the whole album again.
B00CCEHR80|5.0|Well, maybe it's partly knowing this was the last year he sounded great. He sounds like he was really having a good time. As usual with his best shows it was from the heart. He put together another great band for these songs. I miss Jerry . I'm 55 and listen to Jerry more than anyone else. I just never get tired of JGB and The Gratedul Dead. Thanks for all the good times Jerry and company.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Great music - Chicago really swings, enjoyable repeating it.<br />Am a jazz drummer, so appreciate the jazz sound of this CD.
140053271X|5.0|It's actually like a book, you have a digital paper in your hands.<br />Excellent to read, you could change the font's size, the page's margins.<br />Too, your nook is a ecological solution, because you only have to charge it as twice to month
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great when it works.....lots of \\"not responding\\" issues<br /><br />I enjoy playing this game. Bright colorful and fast paced....addictive!I play it every day.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|A well made product that performs as expected. That is, exactly what one expects of Apple. A trifle overpriced though, in my opinion.
0062255657|1.0|I do like some of Gaiman's books but this was definitely not one. What was the point of it? And listening to it, you can't skip over the boring parts. It is not a happy book and why would a loving parent try to drown his child -- too weird even if something evil is making him do it. Wish it had more about the Hemstocks and less about this stupid little boy who is far beyond a 7-year old.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book. This book is one of my favorites. I love the suspense and action. The humor is great too
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I have read several of Ken Follett's books and have enjoyed them all.  Winter of the World: Book Two was no exception.  My wife also read it and found it to be a vivid picture of that era's insanity and she rated the book 4.5 stars out of 5.  We both also read Book One and obviously enjoyed it enough to read Book Two.  You need not read Book One to purchase Book Two, although the characters are in both books, Follett does an excellent job of filling in any gaps.  As in Book One, Book Two follows several families in several countries involved in WWI then WWII.  I thought the details of what occurred and how it effected peoples personal lives was excellent.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This was a fun game, I had no issues with it until the new update. Now I can't play, it says I need to update, I do, then I am told install cancelled, and can't open the game. Sadly I will be uninstalling this app.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love it!!!! I can spend hours playing this game and never ever get tired. my kids love it too
B00A285OOW|4.0|Love all of Phillipa Gregory's books. Very well researched. All the characters come alive!! Will read the whole series  fascinated by the Royal family
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great hours of fun.  I love playing against actual people or even the computer.  Definitely strategy skill building.<br />Get this game.  Brings back memories of family game nigbt
1451695195|5.0|The book is inspiring, honest and truly shared with love. I have had similar experiences. Again coming from a scientist knowing the workings of the brain and nervous system - the unbelievable made believable, because of the sincerity in which it was written. How can one describe the indescribable Eben Alexander has done so. . A beautiful book written also for inquiring minds to explore the ideas possibilities in other literature Mark Twain, Edison, Aldos Huxley and many more, mainly it should be read with an open mind, knowing it was written with Love, helping to shed light on a dark and weary world, and he says with certainty we are not alone, there is hope and Love embraces us.<br />we are not alone, there is hope and Love embraces us.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book the author has a way with words were he could manipulate them and describe everything in detail. I'm 12 and I loved this book. But near the end I broke down and I  stated crying. this book touched my Hart and I hope it does the same to yours
B004ADF7RO|4.0|Would recommend early teens see this thriller. There are several life lessons which can be taken away with you when you watch it. Once may not be enough, so go ahead give it a chance.
1400049628|5.0|Depending on the readers opinion of possible future government collapse... (due to zombies or otherwise), this book is a good read and has many helpful doomsday preparedness ideas.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Is not very well made, but how often will I use it to open a door. Looks pretty good. I do enjoy it.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Bought this for someone special who was/is a fan so they can enjoy it gor years to come! They loved it!
1594203334|5.0|I purchased this book after seeing it spoken about in a magazine.  It's a light hearted funny easy read and very interesting.  I've worked with a french woman, who has given me wonderful marriage advise, so I was eager to hear what french mothers do.  To me it makes perfect sense and I can't wait to try it with my first.  It's tips seem to help you retain your self during motherhood and raise a lovely child which compliments your family; not a child in which the family revolves completely around.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|A sympathetic but real comparison of life between the different classes. A good read for anyone interested in the Arts.
0345350499|2.0|The book was preachy and entirely too long, with repeated passages about mystical stuff that got boring.  It should, and could, have been condensed into half it's length.
B007712XAU|5.0|The acting is superb and the action mesmerizing.I enjoyed the constant interplay between the family and the staff and how well-developed the characters were.
B00464AVXW|4.0|The amazing acting that brad Pitt and Morgan freeman did during the filming of this. But really to be overshadowed by a Oscar winner performance as a deranged psychopath. Every role in this movie, acted by the three actors were overwhelming.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|The guy that did Cloverfield should take camera lessons from the one that did Chronicle.  This movie is different and entertaining. I definitley would recommed having this in your collection.
B002ECN4P0|4.0|I was greatly surprised with the music on the album ,I would recommend this album to anyone.iwould buy it now.
B007L5LD9O|1.0|I usually like chick flicks,but this one lacked the fun in them. The begining was good, ending was good, but everything in between was not.
B001DA9VJW|5.0|the very best blues album put out.Robert plays the guitar as unique as any other guitar player around.your best buy.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|The sequel continues with another page turning novel that is impossible to put down. Can't wait to start the next.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|I was reminded of the pulp magazines located in the check out line of the grocery store!  I kept the application for a grand total of about 5 minutes and deleted it as I'm not interested in the subject matter.
0062255657|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is the kind of book that breaks your heart so well you're not entirely aware of how deep this story goes until you've finished the last page, and take a step back to think about what you've just read.<br /><br />This book is wonderfully written, beautiful, enchanting and goes far further that one expects, as with any of Neil Gaiman's works. Would recommend this in an instant.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|If you have seen the others, you already know what is going to happen. I liked the story line with the others, but this one seemed to leave a lot unanswered in the plot.
B00C8RDSWK|2.0|Was ok not as good as other kid movies that I have purchased and seen compared to Barbie and others
B008YRVW0I|1.0|This app allows you to play quite a few levels and purchase fish, plants, etc. then closes down unless you buy the full version for $4.99!!  Just lets you get to a good place and without warning stops.  Not cool.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game is good but there is one tiny problem my sister gets on and the profile we use is always cut in half and it looks like a different seed not worth seven dollars
2321002131|5.0|This dictionary allows you to think in French, without switching back and forth from French to English.  It's a great dictionary, and I love it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its really awesome but one part i  hate it doesn't let me update for my kindle fire please fix that
B002KLOPF8|5.0|Classic film from the big three Vietnam era movies - Full metal jacket, Platoon and Hamburger Hill.  Gritty and great line and performance by the Gunny
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun! No lag. And extremely addictive. Play under your own risk. It's almost like Temple run. Have fun!
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Great Sc-Fe movie . . Kurt Russell was awesome.  I really enjoyed watching it again - definitely recommend this movie
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I don't know what else to say but that I love, love, love it!  Just a feel good and fun Cd
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun app for wasting time. My son and I have been involved with this one. Download and enjoy the game.
B000AJIF4E|2.0|We had another pair of Sony headphones that worked great (the earlier version of this one). Unfortunately, we had to return this one because of an annoying buzz in one of the ear pieces.
B00819ER0Q|5.0|I am 23 and this was the first time I've seen this movie. It is absolutely interesting, and I highly recommend it to everyone!
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|A delightful, well written and acted movie about being old ,wanting to be relevant, coping with failing health and losing friends. However, where these artists, yes they are all musicians or opera singers, live is such a delightful place that it makes one long to be in their situation. However, for those of us of a certain age it is a must see movie.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Fun, well-designed activities, cheerful graphics and no ads or in-app purchases.  The mini-games do not have any kind of scoring or leveling, which makes them great for young children.  Older children may lose interest quickly, but will probably still enjoy at first.  Home run, TribePlay!
B0094M2ITG|4.0|We watched this movie with our two preteen girls.  It wasn't too violent, or mature themed & had a good storyline that kept us all interested.  I recommend this movie for a good stay at home & make some popcorn kind of night.
0062024329|2.0|was told to read this, yet it was a waste of time. It could be the translation or it just does make carton like some content
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good, quick moving, but it's over too quickly. There's a promise of more floors, but I've yet to see them
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|It's nice to have a memo-pad app that's both free and allows handwriting. You can either save a note manually or by exiting the writing screen.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|It was fun - while it lasted, but it seemed to end too quickly, leaving space taken up on the Kindle.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I liked this third book of the series best.  There is an actual story line, not just sex acts( but there are still a few of those).  I chose to just read the first sentence of those types of paragraphs and go on with the story line. I'm sure this type of reading is enjoyed by many, I'm just not one of them.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Good, quick moving, but it's over too quickly.  There's a promise of more floors, but I've yet to see them
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I freakin' loved this movie. I went into it with serious doubts, thinking I was about to waste 1 1/2 hours of my life. I ended up loving this movie!! This movie is hilarious, well acted, and well sung. Admittedly, I'm a sucker for underdog sports movies and that's pretty much what Pitch Perfect is but with a capella singing. Give it a whirl. Get it on Netflix or rent it first, that's what I did. But then I liked it so much that I had to buy it. This is a really fun movie and surprisingly really funny! Well worth it.
0375869026|5.0|I LOVED this book.<br /><br />It was an extremely lovely book. The author coveys Auggie with a sure delicate touch. Touching in many many ways without pity plays or overdramatized overly contrived situations/encounters. Auggie was just so real and so well realized that I just cheered for him constantly.<br /><br />Marvelous.<br /><br />I would need a shrink to figure out why I enjoyed this book so much yet, felt none of the same joy reading Out of my Mind.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Minimalism at its best....Production on this album will set trends. Incredibly hard to describe. Nothing like his previous albums , accept that last track Bound 2 Bound which reminds me of the late registration and college dropout vibe. It's an ugly masterpiece...quite simply.
B005544TRQ|5.0|a less cheesy version of White Collar, great dialogue, I'm hooked! This show requires your undivided attention, listen closely or you may miss something
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this cute little game. Its not exactly meant for little kids, but entertains me quite a bit as a bored adult. Sometimes the response of my finger swipes dont seem to catch but so far it doesnt seem to take too much away from the fun factor while Im on a break.
1476734941|5.0|I am 55 years old and post-menopausal.  What this diet seems to do (that others have not) is that through fasting your system seems to be shocked just enough to let the weight loss process actually begin and progress.  I have lost about 18 pounds in two months.  The fasting was a little bit difficult at first but now I look forward to those days - both physically and mentally.  Previous to fasting, and menopause!, it did not seem that I could move my weight more than a couple of pounds and then gain it right back. I just feel so much healthier.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|If youre a fan of galaga, this is a great portable game. Response time is pretty damn good, sometimes the bugs were in a predictable pattern but you would not really be able to kill them all by sitting in place since they will move faster than last time or too fast to catch a hit, which in turn sets up the rest of the stage for finishing off the invasion. I love this cute little arcade flashback. Still play it after months of not playing it for a while and is still a blast.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love legal dramas.  Then you add a bit of sexy and funny - and it makes a show I love!
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|its cute but boring and repetitive after the first couple levels. not worth paying for, but might be ok free and if you like repetitive platform games.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love a good legal drama.  This one was many cases and action and some interpersonal drama.  Great show.  I am addicted
B00AK57N00|3.0|Its repetative, but then again it helps get timing of the jumps down. Its cute, but i wouldn't pay for the game, I would take it free... and even then it was only played for about a day or two before i got bored with it.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was on level 54 and now I can't play because of an update that it won't let me download from the app store.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The beginning was slow and the ending was not at all what it should have been. But the middle was interesting, so it got 3 stars from me. I just expected a lot more I guess.
034580404X|5.0|it made me smile...........shades of gregory peck, rock hudson, errol flynn, clark gable sculpted into a modern guy--but same story, just more vivid.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|After finishing part one, I wasn't sure I'd make it much farther. The beginning section wasn't bad, per se, it just didn't seem to be going anywhere plotwise. After the first third, I got way more into it and gained a deeper appreciation for the author's use of different points of view to complete Jun Do's story. I especially liked how the author told part of the tale as a N Korean propaganda piece. Well done, and worth the slow beginning,
B005544TRQ|4.0|Interesting characters and great stories.  Can't wait to get to the next episode.<br /><br />I'll probably watch season 2 as well.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|This product was never a help to me at all. I downloaded to view items sent to me from law enforcemeent sites for training and information, however I could never get it to work for me. I would recommend tthis product.
1451648537|4.0|The book is very engaging and interesting barring a few stretches. An inspirational book for the future thought leaders. An unputdownable book of all times.
B003E48AYC|1.0|Every disc of this movie I purchase was scratched and would not play. An absolute complete waste of my money. If I could get my money back I would in a heart beat. Will never purchase from this seller again.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Really bad and lame. Just not worth the time or energy to play it. I would never recommend this game to anyone, ever.
1451648537|1.0|The book is a dull and drab account of a person who was arguably the greatest innovator ever. I also made the mistake of reading this book after having read Barbarians at the gate. The latter provides a perfect contrast of the writing style - Barbarians at the gate is incisive and gripping, something that this book sorely lacks.<br /><br />What is worse is that there are several grammatical and formatting errors - I found three mistakes. It is really ironical that the biography of a person who was regarded as a perfectionist has such obvious errors in his biography.<br /><br />The best thing about the book is it's cover, which oddly enough seems was contributed by Steve Jobs himself.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Really good! Loved the whole comedy / horror mix of the movie. Some absolutely HILARIOUS moments that had me guffawing like crazy .. You have hillbillies, \\"crazy\\" college kids, chainsaws and lotsa beer. Makes for a good fun time if you ask me :) .. MUST WATCH!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Needs a update soon cause 0.7.3 is out for other devices but it's still awesome<br />  so when will the update let me know plz
159562015X|5.0|It is amazing, very usefull, clear unique. I recomded. Now with my strengths I now better wath to do, when to do, and with who does.
0425263908|1.0|I know everyone's taste is different but I felt this book had no substance.  They didn't seem to love each other at all just used sex as a battlefield.<br /> I want to be open minded though and plan to read some more of the author's work
B004Q3UL2O|1.0|Two good actors wasting my time.  I don't need to see that anywhere.  This should have had a stronger rating in my opinion.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|In reading all the books, I couldn't wait to read the final story. I was so satisfied. Thank you Robert and Brandon!!!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is a great app. Many filters and effects available. 100% recommended. And another great thing, I got it free. Thanks AMAZON
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg's wise and inspiring words are both motivating and comforting.  As a working mother of 4 children with a passion for leading I took solace in knowing that I can lead at home and work.  I hope Sheryl inspires a revolution of women to lead and that my daughter knows she can reach her potential and achieve equality in the workplace.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|Meh.  Funny 80's references for us 30 somethings that will probably be lost on today's kids.  Beyond that, it's a kid's movie made for kids, which was just fine for the god daughter.  I don't expect to be entertained by kid's movies.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I needed it for charging my kindle book and it absolutely does not fit the plug of the book, neither any other device I own!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|This is my favorite show since Battlestar Galactica. Fast paced, interesting story, fun sci-fi, great characters, AMAZING acting. I got this for my birthday and my husband and I stayed up all night watching it because we just couldn't bring ourselves to stop. Can't recommend it enough.
B003WTE886|5.0|She is a great artist and I can understand why the public loves her.  She really has the talent and is attracts crowds.
B002HNA95E|5.0|I play this music frequently and does it bring back memories.  She has always been a great artist and dancer.
B0042H6VY6|5.0|Listening to the Pet Shop Boys brought back a flood of memories.  Wow, and to think that we have aged.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|not as good as the original, but pretty fun.  Lots of fun special effects.  It rambles a bit, but sill entertaining
B00DOW5PO2|5.0|This is Selena Gomez best cd. It's my favorite album listen to outside of Christian Music. All 15 songs are clean & have no cuss words. It's real heavy with pop dance beats which is AWESOME!!! None of the songs have cheesy lyrics. It's lots fun. I love that u get 15 songs.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is lots of fun it's Peter the number 3  I hope you have fun playing it .tried to get friends to play it  .that like it to
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesomeness ,because of all the fun you will have  playing this game. Beware game is very addictive.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really like this book in fact I love all the wimpy kid books they are so fun and cool
B005LAIH2W|5.0|My whole family loves this movie. The story, characters, plot twists...it is just awesome. I couldn't count how many times we've watched it, and will continue to see it over and over. Very few movies, no matter how well done, will I watch over and over, this one I already have.<br /><br />I just wish it had been promoted better. Several of the movie reviewers gave it bad reviews, but everyone we know who has actually seen it, enjoyed the experience.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Our family enjoyed this movie. We recommend it to other families. It tells the story of the Wizard's introduction to Oz and the play of each of the witches.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|I recommend this book for people who do like tragedies but ones that get resolved in the end. I thought this was a great book and it left the reader wondering what was going to happen
0385474547|4.0|I'm satisfied with the fast shipping. I have no dilemmas with the book. There's a few writings behind the cover-page. It doesn't bug me though. The book is still in great condition. I would definitely order from this supplier again.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|There is so much to love here. First, the movies themselves are great. Parts I and II are consistently in the IMDB top 100.<br /><br />Second, the digital transfers for these blurays look tremendous. Clear picture, great audio, no artifacting. Whoever did the transfer work here did a great job.<br /><br />Third, there are no obnoxious \\"experience\\" things between you and the menus. You pop the disc in, and you are at the main menu ready to enjoy the movie in seconds.<br /><br />Fourth, the price is terrific.<br /><br />I highly recommend this box set to anyone who likes these films, who hasn't yet seen them, or who is looking for a great set of bluray movies to add to their collection.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Love all three movies. It's a great combination on Blu-Ray and a better value than the three individually. I'm not sure who'll get more enjoyment out of this set, my son or me.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|The movie was pretty good in and of itself. Great effects, acting was good... story was intriguing. But as far as being a part of the Oz tale, I'd say it was just so-so.<br /><br />If you are a die hard fan of the classic, I'd say you can overlook this one and not be missing out. But, if you just want to see a visually gripping and entertaining film, it'd be worth the $3/4.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I did it want this book to end. I have tears in my eyes as I write this. I love her writing so much. What an amazing life. What an amazing journey.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I've watched it about 7 times.  There's always more revealed every time.  2001 is the only other movie for which I've said that.
0062255657|3.0|Prior to reading this novel, I hadn't read anything by the author. I was aware of the high rating on Amazon, however, so I expected this book to pull me in. (Full disclosure: I listened to the audio version of this book, read by the author himself.)<br /><br />I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed. I love fantasy novels and knew I would enjoy the overall premise of the book based on the synopsis. However, there was never a point during the novel where I felt wrapped up in the story. I did appreciate the quality of the prose, but the characters themselves were mildly interesting at best.<br /><br />To me, this seems like a book targeted more towards adolescents than adults. This was an enjoyable read but I'm surprised that it has gotten such critical acclaim.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I keep this in my laptop bag in case I forget my power supply, which happens a couple times a year.  I can often find friends or coworkers with an older Mac.  This makes it possible to borrow their charger.
B000I186FW|4.0|It's comic-booky and a bit over the top, but it makes it's point about what we trade when our safety becomes more important than our freedom. Good acting.
B00ADS98FC|1.0|Most unwatchable movie ever, but my house guests wanted it.  Acting, dialog, direction seemed like 5th graders did it for a class project.  Apologies to all 5th graders.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|First off, I enjoyed this movie. Why? The environment provided, and the acting as scripted in the situation provided. I saw all the plot holes and the problems with the film, but the redeeming quality is the smoothness the characters glue this film together with. I was not looking forward to action scenes,the movie provided for the imaginative of the viewers. The movie provided plot twists that justified my attention and being there. I try not to ruin a movie for myself, even if the plot suggests an outcome. I sit back and repress the ideas I have and let the movie present them as they see fit. The thing this movie did for me, as compared to others is gave me room to think about what was going on between scenes. Yes, this was a movie that was a compiled bunch of ideas from other movies and such, but that's a management issue,and not the movies fault. I think the actors did the best with what they were given(sloppy mess maybe?) and executed well. The main problem and I've mentioned this before is that to present a good sci-fi, you must adopt a written work and then massage it. This was not done here and it shows. Still, this is light years ahead of Transformers, Battledshit, and Pacicifc Rum. I still ask producers with deep pockets to look at real stories like Tau Zero, The Mote in Gods Eye, and the Giants Novels specifically 'Inherit the Stars' for a blockbuster, major budget production that will leave the audience contemplating the ideals of the plot for weeks is not years. I am looking forward to Enders Game, although I don;t really consider that a real sci-fi masterpiece, but it should prove better than things like Pacific Rum and Battleship(aka stupidity). Of course the demographics show a really stupid populace and until that changes, we may be in store for more mind numbing nonsense.
1451695195|5.0|This certainly is one of the best books I read on OBE. Dr Alexander is NOT DEAD and he is not having NDE. HIs neocortex is rendered in-operational due to severe E. coli infection and that is why, as he has stated, that he could go deeper into the beyond than many others who claimed to have NDE.<br /> He uses only few sentences to try to tell some profound truths (e.g. the inter connective relations of us all and with the Greater Consciousness or OM ). It is this kind of experience or insight that is the gem of this book and give us hope and reason for our compassion and kindness to our fellow sentient beings who after all, is our brothers and sisters.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is kinda the same as Candy Crush! Kindle doesnt have candy crush and this is the closest i can get to candy crush. When is candy crush coming to kindle?!?!?
B00AFROVQC|1.0|To the point, the most hackneyed, cliche-ridden, dull story I've read in years.  The characters are shallow, stupid and utterly predictable.  And to top it off, the \\"bad guy\\" is a \\"deviant\\" (sic), but the author doesn't have anything against gays.  Gag.  Hated it.  One star is far too generous.
B005LAII0I|4.0|excellent deal. the movie had one scratch that affected one scene of the entire movie. still a great movie to buy
B0042KZJ5K|5.0|Love the movie and love the music...which is interesting, since I don't normally listen to this type!  Would recommend this.
B003905M56|5.0|I loved Rick Astley's voice then and I still love it!  Great remastering and bonus songs make this a fun listen.
B005LZWA5W|5.0|This is an amazing movie and the Blue Ray version is outstanding, even a couple of glitches can be forgiven because of the great restoration work overall. Hope more movies of Jack Lemmon could be released on Blue Ray this way.
B0041KVYIW|3.0|The second side was a little scratched so the first two songs on that side skipped a bit. Other than that it was in fine condition. However, missing a couple songs ins't okay, so I don't think I'll be buying from them again.
B0000028RR|5.0|When I first bought the album, I liked a couple songs, mainly \\"Killing in the Name\\" and \\"Take the Power Back.\\" The more I've listened to it, the more I've liked. Every time I listen to the album, I gain a better appreciation for different songs and like it even more than I did before. Almost every song is great and has a ton of energy.  Great to listen to when you're pissed off or have fantasies of overthrowing the establishment. I am also impressed with the musicianship in the band. Tom Morello is an excellent guitar player. Some of my favorite songs are \\"Settle for Nothing,\\" \\"Township Rebellion,\\" and \\"Fistful of Steel.\\" If you like really hard rock, I highly recommend the album. It's really become a favorite of mine.
0679882820|5.0|There are fun sounds to make as you read along with your child together.<br />Like other Dr Seuss books kids also learn to rhyme. Would definitely recommend.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|This review is quite difficult. I read the book and thought to myself, &#34;How will they ever be able to make this into a movie?&#34; The first third of the book essentially takes place in the protagonist's head. Well, I think that they did a pretty good job at glossing over the difficulties the character went through, but yet still made it understandable. As with any adaptation from a novel, great amounts of story had to be pared down to fit in a two hour format. For the most part, it is done successfully here. However, some of the material missing from the movie does diminish the effectiveness of the climax of the story. Overall, it's a decent movie. (Orders of magnitude better than the &#34;Twilight&#34; movies.)<br /><br />The presentation is pristine, the supplements are adequate, and the sound is fantastic.<br /><br />It's a great rental, but a questionable buy.
B001HN6922|3.0|I was disappointed that this was not as great as the original. The movie takes place in Europe, not Radiator Springs.<br />There is not much in the way of racing in this one and there are all new characters along with Lightning McQueen, Mater and the gang. For my 2 year olds it was hard to follow, too much going on; whereas they could watch the original Cars movie over and over and over again. I wouldn't recommend for the youngest ones.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Lots of music you will recognize and enjoy. Several new compositions are well represented here also. A strong follow-up to a fantastic debut album. If you liked their first album you definitely like this one, too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is the best game I have ever played it gives you hints your getting points by running things over wen it big  it keeps me occupied when I have nothing to do its a really nice fun game
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I liked this book, it was written well and gave an insight into the orphanages and long term pain as a result. I would read this book again and I'm not one to read a book more than once.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|A really fun HO game. With challenging levels. I agree that although you can spend money to advance, you Don't have to. Patience is the key.
1592407889|5.0|This lovely book was at my back door on the eve of my birthday a few weeks ago, my favorite summer read.  Few women of my generation don't admire and have an opinion on Shirley MacLaine; she transported us with her acting, singing and comedy, and validated our times with her books, \\"Out on a Limb\\" was life changing for me years ago.  Sachi Parker has proved once again that the fruit does not fall too far from the tree.  Her book had me engaged every time I picked it up and sorry that I had to put it down, all the while soaking up the biography of an amazing woman in an extraordinary family.  As for the dear friend who left me this fascinating book at my door, this is what I just posted on her FaceBook page:  Writing Yoga Memoirs:  ( [...]  )<br />\\" Finished reading \\"Lucky Me\\"; thank you so much for lending it to me, and for encouraging me to finish the last few pages...found this:<br />\\"Traditionally, a Japanese Zen garden, a karesansui, has fifteen stones, so carefully arranged that you can see only fourteen of them at a time; you can never see that fifteenth stone.<br />That's how it is with people and relationships. There's always that fifteenth stone you can't see, but you know it's there. And when you find it, the fifteenth stone, that secret thing that explains all, you look back and you realize that another stone has disappeared. You can never see a person, or a relationship, or a life, whole. There are too many angles\\"
B00DFFHUUA|5.0|This movie is FANTASTIC. The integration of classic story lines from the original cartoon series from the 1980's integrated into a modern looking live action movie is sheer genius.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I think this is a great implementation of the spider game. It lets you tap to move stacks, smoothly change orientation, use as many suites as you want, saves your progress if you leave the screen or get a call. Unfortunately, while I can tolerate the start up ads, they have a tendency to put video ads on - which impact my data plan adversely, and totally balk at letting you play without an active connection to the Internet. This makes playing on a tablet difficult to impossible. Sometimes if the game is already started, I can finish a game, but not start up a new one without  a connection of some sort. I would happily pay for an an ad free version I could play anywhere. HINT hint!! As well, developers should never put video ads on a game and not give you a way to opt out.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|If you like puzzles and hidden object games then this one works well. Woven within a mystery game set in a magical world I have found it to be engrossing and fun. The character interactions are a bit tedious but you can live with that. I would like to see a third edition.
B00003CXXP|5.0|The still and quiet at the end speaks so loud and clear on believing dreams and fairy tales when that belief becomes hardwired.  Our look back takes place within mere years and not centuries. then even our ending becomes a new discovery and life goes on.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|This app works awesome as a baby and security monitor! I have no complaints at all. Keep up the great work.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not stop reading ........I am going to start the third one immediately ....... I hope the last one is as good
B005K17RU0|5.0|Awesome free weather app. The best out there for the price. Very convenient to have the temp &amp; forecast on my home screen at all times.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Enjoy playing the game.  Having a lot of trouble with advertising ads.  Have contacted c.s. department twice and problem not solved yet.  Will try again.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The story is full of misery, greed and misdeeds that ruin lives without checks, balances or afterthought.  The country that Hosseini writes about will never be one that is at peace regardless of invading armies.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|A nice and sweet HEA romance. Good characters and an interesting story line  I enjoyed this story and would read others by this author.
B00CBBY638|5.0|He has a great voice and has sung some fun danceable songs along with moving pieces on this album. Love it!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I love The Good Wife Season 3 because it keeps you wanting to see more episodes. I especially love the topics and guest stars on the show. The character Kalinda is very intriguing. I highly recommend this entire series.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was awesome. The series had good characters, fun sex, and was worth reading all three books. Wish there was more.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I didn't even have the energy to finish this book.  I kept waiting for the climax, and after reading more than half, I gave up.  The story was repetitive, and actually kind of boring.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  The kind of story I like with lots of interesting people whose lives eventually intertwine.  Must read.  Would recommend for a book club.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Compared to all others, I find AI Factory games to be the best.  My collection is nearly complete. Try them, you'll not be sorry.
B0091WNK8M|2.0|It Sucked big time could not watch that crap, I'll try again when I'm drunk, after a few beers maybe??
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the game. Simple and easy. It has good settings and good options. I have not run into any  problems with it to date. Very good game.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Randomly shuts off or gets crackle sound. Nt sure why, but knocked a star off for it. Otherwise it is excellent.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|This CD is great. There are about 20 tracks on each CD (for each movie). The music is wonderful and puts you right back into the movie. There are pictures in it as well.<br />Could not be happier with it.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|After seeing RED2 at the movie theater we had to rent this as well. We frankly liked the second movie better as they took more advantage of the actors and made their characters a bit more multi-dimensional (Referencing John Malkovich's character in particular). That being said, if you are a fan of the shoot 'em up and blow 'em up genre, I would think that you would enjoy this little gem. How can you go wrong with this cast, really! The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones, Anthony Hopkins and Lee Byung-hun to the sequel was icing on the cake, and they made the whole thing a lot funnier!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Funny, action packed, full of surprises.  Although Helen Mirren only had a supporting role, her acting was supurb. Can't wait for Red 2.
B009ZQNN90|4.0|I loved watching a cast of unknowns (at least to this American) tell a funny, touching story. Great acting on the part of all including the factory workers. I loved the lead as well and watch him handle his struggles with both work and relationships. This story stayed true to its characters both on the part of the straight people and on the part of the drag queen.
0788859544|5.0|This video has been seen by my Grandaughter at least 50 times - It is a classic - I never tire of it either.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|My 7 year old loves this game and can play for hours if I let her. I think it's the only game she plays on her fire.
B00AEFYXD6|3.0|Funny in parts -  I was disappointed - was expecting the characters to rival the character in Shrek or Ice Age.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I started watching Suits at the end of Season 2 on USA and got hooked immediately!  With Season 3 starting I needed and wanted to know everything on the show so bought both Season 1 & 2 and stayed up late for 2 weeks watching them....so awesome!!! Patrick J. Adams is adorable!!  He's so witty and his expressions make me laugh!! I highly recommend Suits to everyone...it rates right up there with White Collar in my book...USA shows are the best!!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Addicting game! The narration is funny and the gophers are clever. Started with the free version but I am going to have to buy the extended version so I can keep playing.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|From beginning to end this movie was just one big cliche after another.  There was nothing unique about it at all.  The video quality was okay but not outstanding for an HD picture.  At best is seemed to reach an acceptable 720 but it never seemed to display the sharpness of a 1080 picture.
B006O5XYWG|3.0|I question the plausibility of the story line in this movie both from the perspective of what happens to advance the apes to what happens to society once they are. I just feel they ask us to take too big a leap of faith. Having said that, their story is well told and the acting good, hence the third star.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|The message is good and the acting was well done and the music was interesting. A good remake on a classic movie.
0312430000|4.0|The book is well written and the main theme is suggested by the title. I agree with the author totally on this. Probably because of my prior knowledge, it does not add too much more to me, nevertheless, it is a book that worth reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i absolutly love this app it gives me hours of fun the only downside is that u have to have wifi
B005ILWOZA|5.0|I bought this jhust for 1 song but turns out I like the whole thing! He looks like Chris Martin of Coldplay but sounds better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You will get really into it and it's hard to stop watching; however, it's sad at the end, but definitely looking forward to another season
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is a great look at what the life of the historical Jesus must have been like. The author did over 20 years of research to produce it, and that shows...it's a compelling read!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Got this finally, today. Setup was a breeze. Cast Youtube and Chrome tabs, they all worked perfectly. Had a problem with Netflix though. Evreytime I cast Netflix to Chromecast, it loads a long time and after that tells me that the video was not available. After that my internet slows down significantly. Had to reset my modem and router and Chromecast for my internet to return to normal. It happened when I cast from my laptop on win7 and my android tablet on ics. Googled the problem but it seems the only know problem so far is Netflix not working well with android 4.3. Other than the Netflix issue, I love the Chromecast. If anyone has any suggetions regarding the Netflix issue, feel free to comment.
B0096BIENY|5.0|I listen to these incredible singers hour after hour!!  They warm my heart.  I feel peaceful and happy with their amazing soaring voices.
B006T5GTK0|1.0|Somehow expected better as it does not follow the book. Peter Finch is not my idea of a leading man.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A masterpiece at its finest. I could not get enough so i am a bit disappointed that the game was over so quickly. I figured for $2 it would be ongoing...perhaps a update is in store????
B0026P3G12|5.0|Great wonderful story and great singer. Love it. Inspirational sweet gal. amazing  wonderful voice. Susan  You go girl! Great!! Love it.
055358202X|4.0|This book isn't as good as the last but it's still wonderful.  And now that you don't have to wait for the 5th book it's even better.  I've read it 3 times now and I highly recommend you read it at least once.
